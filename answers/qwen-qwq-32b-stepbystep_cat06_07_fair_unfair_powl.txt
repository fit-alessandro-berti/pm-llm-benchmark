Okay, I need to create two POWL models for the hiring process described. The first one should have potential unfairness due to the community affiliation check, and the second should eliminate that by having a standard evaluation for everyone. Let me start by breaking down the process steps as per the problem description.

First, the common steps for both models:

1. The process starts with receiving the application and parsing the resume. The resume parsing includes a check for completeness. If there's missing data, the applicant is asked to provide more info, which loops back until the data is complete. That's a loop structure here.

2. After that comes the skill assessment. If they pass, they proceed; otherwise, maybe they're rejected? Or perhaps only those above the threshold continue. The problem says those below a threshold are disqualified, so SkillAssessment must have a threshold check. But in the POWL model, the SkillAssessment is an activity, and the threshold check would determine the next steps, but since it's part of the assessment's score, maybe that's handled in the activity's logic. Since the problem doesn't mention branching based on skill scores except disqualification, perhaps the SkillAssessment is followed by the next steps only if they pass. But in the POWL model, activities are executed in order, so maybe the SkillAssessment is just a step, and those who don't meet the threshold are excluded from proceeding. But the model should represent the process flow, not the outcome. Hmm, perhaps the SkillAssessment is an activity, and only those who pass proceed further. So the model doesn't need to branch here; it's just part of the sequence until that point.

Wait, the problem says after the skill assessment, the next step is the cultural fit or affiliation check. So the SkillAssessment is a single activity, and then comes the cultural part. The key difference between the two models is the cultural fit step.

In the unfair model, after the skill assessment, there's an XOR choice between standard CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. The CommunityAffiliationCheck gives some advantage, so that's where the unfairness comes in. The managerial review and final decision follow after that.

In the fair model, there's no such XOR. All go through the same CulturalFitCheck, then to ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the main difference is the presence of the XOR between CulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck in the first model, versus a single CulturalFitCheck in the second.

Now, let's structure the steps in order.

First, the initial steps:

- ReceiveApplication
- Then the resume parsing and data check loop. The problem says: "Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: automated system scans... missing info triggers a loop where the applicant is asked to provide more. So the loop is: DataCompletenessCheck followed by a RequestMoreInfo? Or perhaps the loop is between DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo until data is complete.

Wait, the process says "any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding." So the loop would be: DataCheck (check resume data)  if data incomplete, go to RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCheck again, until the data is complete. So the loop structure here is a loop between DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop operator would be a loop between DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo?

Wait, the problem says the loop is triggered when data is missing. So the loop is: DataCheck (checks if data is there)  if not, then RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCheck again. So the loop would be structured as a loop between the two activities: the loop operator would have A (DataCheck) and B (RequestMoreInfo), so the loop is * (A, B). Because the loop requires executing A (DataCheck), then if needed, do B (RequestMoreInfo), then repeat. Wait, actually, the loop operator in POWL is defined as a loop between A and B. The loop operator * (A, B) means you first execute A, then either exit the loop or execute B followed by A again. So, in this case, the process is:

Start with DataCheck. If the data is incomplete, you have to go through RequestMoreInfo (B), then back to DataCheck (A). So the loop would be A followed by B and then back, until the data is complete. So the loop operator here would be the loop between the data check and the request more info. So the loop is represented as * (DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo).

After that, the next steps are SkillAssessment, then the cultural check (which branches in the unfair case), then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

Wait, let's outline the steps in order:

Common steps for both models:

1. ReceiveApplication (activity)
2. Then the loop for data completeness:
   - DataCompletenessCheck (activity)
   - If incomplete, go to RequestMoreInfo (activity), then loop back to DataCompletenessCheck again. This is the loop structure * (A, B), where A is DataCompletenessCheck and B is RequestMoreInfo. Wait, but actually, the loop operator in POWL uses the loop operator between the two: the loop operator is * (A,B), which means execute A, then decide whether to loop (execute B followed by A again) or exit. So in this case, the loop would be between the check and the request. So the loop is between the DataCheck and RequestMore steps.

Wait, perhaps:

The loop is a loop between DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the structure would be:

The initial path is:

ReceiveApplication  [Loop (DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo)]  SkillAssessment  [Cultural check step (either standard or with the XOR)]  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Wait, but in POWL, the loop is represented as an OperatorPOWL with the LOOP operator. So the loop structure is * (DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo).

After that comes the SkillAssessment as a single activity.

Then comes the cultural check step. Here's where the difference comes in.

For the unfair model:

After SkillAssessment, there's an XOR choice between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. The XOR means that for some applicants, they take one path, and others the other. The unfairness is because the CommunityAffiliationCheck gives an advantage, so the XOR allows that branch to be taken when affiliation is present, thus creating an unfair advantage.

In the fair model, instead of the XOR, all go through CulturalFitCheck only.

Then, after the cultural steps, it goes to ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the structure for the unfair model would be:

The main workflow is:

ReceiveApplication  Loop  SkillAssessment  XOR (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Wait, but the XOR is between the two branches. So the XOR operator would be an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR, containing the two activities. So the path after SkillAssessment is an XOR choice between the two activities.

Wait, but in the description, the process says that the Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check step is an XOR where one path is standard, and the other gives an uplift. So the process here is that the system either goes through the standard cultural fit or the community check. So the XOR branch is between those two activities.

Hence, in the unfair model, after SkillAssessment, the process branches via XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. The choice between these two would depend on whether the applicant has the affiliation. Since the unfairness is introduced by this XOR branch, that's the key point.

In the fair model, there's no such XOR. All go through the standard CulturalFitCheck, so that activity is just a single node.

Now, structuring the models as POWL.

First, the common parts:

Start with the activities in sequence:

Start  ReceiveApplication  Loop (DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo)  SkillAssessment  ...  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Now, the loop part:

The loop for data completeness is a loop between DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So that's an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP, containing DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The loop operator is between A and B. The loop is * (A, B). The way the loop works is:

First, execute A (DataCompletenessCheck). If the data is incomplete, then you have to do B (RequestMoreInfo), then repeat A again. So the loop is between the check and the request. So the loop is * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo).

Wait, in the problem's description, the loop is "If the resume is complete and structured correctly, the process continues." So the loop is triggered when data is incomplete. So the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop operator is * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo).

Wait, the loop operator in POWL is defined as a loop between two activities. The operator is applied to two sub-models A and B. The loop works as: execute A (DataCheck), then either exit the loop (if data is complete) or execute B (RequestMoreInfo), then A again, etc.

Therefore, the loop part is an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP, children [DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo].

So the first part of the workflow would be the loop.

Now, the first model (unfair) after the loop:

After the loop, the next step is SkillAssessment, then comes the XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Wait, but how does the XOR work here? The XOR is an exclusive choice between the two paths. So the XOR operator would have the two branches as its children. The XOR is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR, children [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck].

So the path after SkillAssessment is the XOR operator, which branches into either CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then, after that, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision follow.

Wait, but the ManagerialReview and FinalDecision are after the cultural check. So the sequence after the cultural check would be ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Putting it all together, the unfair model's structure would be:

The main flow is:

ReceiveApplication  Loop (Data and Request)  SkillAssessment  XOR (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

But in terms of POWL structure, the entire workflow is a partial order.

Wait, perhaps the structure is built as a partial order where each step is linked in sequence, except the XOR point. Let me think step by step.

First, the first model (unfair):

The nodes would include all the activities and operators.

Breaking down the unfair model's structure:

The process starts with ReceiveApplication.

Then, the loop structure for data completeness:

LoopNode = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Then, after the loop comes SkillAssessment (activity).

Then comes the XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. That's an XOR operator with those two activities as children.

Then, after that, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the main flow would be a partial order where the sequence is:

ReceiveApplication must come first. Then the loop (DataCheck and RequestMoreInfo) must be after that. Then comes SkillAssessment, then the XOR between CulturalFit and CommunityAffiliation, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

But how to model the entire workflow as a partial order with the necessary dependencies.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire workflow is a partial order where each step is in sequence, but the XOR is an operator.

Alternatively, the entire workflow can be structured as a sequence of steps, with the XOR being an operator at the cultural check point.

Let me try to outline the Unfair model's structure:

The overall structure would be a sequence of activities connected via partial order dependencies.

Let me list the activities and operators needed:

Activities needed for unfair model:

- ReceiveApplication (activity)
- DataCompletenessCheck (activity)
- RequestMoreInfo (activity)
- SkillAssessment (activity)
- CulturalFitCheck (activity)
- CommunityAffiliationCheck (activity)
- ManagerialReview (activity)
- FinalDecision (activity)

And operators:

- The loop for data: * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
- The XOR between the two cultural checks: X (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)

So the overall structure would have:

The main flow is:

ReceiveApplication  Loop  SkillAssessment  XOR  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Wait, but the loop is part of the initial steps. Let's structure it step by step.

The entire workflow's structure can be represented as a partial order where the sequence is:

Start  ReceiveApplication must come first.

Then, after ReceiveApplication comes the loop (DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo loop). The loop is modeled as the loop operator * (DataCheck, RequestMore). So the loop is part of the initial steps.

After the loop comes SkillAssessment.

After that, the XOR between the two cultural checks.

Then, after that, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So, the entire model is a sequence of these nodes with dependencies:

The loop comes after ReceiveApplication and before SkillAssessment.

The SkillAssessment must happen after the loop.

The XOR comes after the SkillAssessment.

ManagerialReview after the XOR's branches.

FinalDecision after ManagerialReview.

So the model structure can be represented as a partial order where the nodes are:

- The loop operator (for the data check loop)
- The SkillAssessment activity
- The XOR operator (with the two options)
- ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

The dependencies are:

ReceiveApplication  loop  SkillAssessment  XOR  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Wait, but in terms of the POWL nodes, the loop is an operator node, so the overall structure would be a partial order where:

- The loop is after ReceiveApplication.
- The loop's completion leads to SkillAssessment.

Then, after SkillAssessment comes the XOR between the two cultural activities.

The XOR is an operator node with two children.

The ManagerialReview must come after whichever path is taken from the XOR.

Therefore, the structure would be:

The main nodes in the StrictPartialOrder would include:

- The loop operator (loop_node)
- SkillAssessment (activity)
- The XOR operator (xor_node)
- ManagerialReview (activity)
- FinalDecision (activity)
- ReceiveApplication (activity)

The dependencies would be:

ReceiveApplication must come before the loop_node.

The loop_node must come before SkillAssessment.

SkillAssessment must come before xor_node.

The xor_node's children (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) are the options, so the XOR operator has those two as children.

Wait, actually in the OperatorPOWL for the XOR, the children are the two branches. So the XOR operator contains the two activities as its children.

Wait, no— the XOR operator in POWL is an operator node with two children (the two options). Each child is a POWL model. Since the two branches are activities, each child is just that activity node. So the XOR operator would have two children: one is CulturalFitCheck and the other is CommunityAffiliationCheck. So the XOR node is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR and children [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck].

Then, after the XOR, the next steps are ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Therefore, the sequence after the XOR is that whichever of the two branches is taken, then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision follow.

So the ManagerialReview must come after the XOR's outcome. So in the partial order, the XOR must precede ManagerialReview.

Therefore, the partial order nodes would be arranged so that the path through the XOR is followed by ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Putting it all together, the unfair model's structure in terms of the StrictPartialOrder would have the following nodes:

- ReceiveApplication (activity)
- loop_node (the loop operator between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo)
- SkillAssessment (activity)
- xor_node (the XOR between the two cultural checks)
- ManagerialReview (activity)
- FinalDecision (activity)

The dependencies are:

After ReceiveApplication comes the loop_node.

Then, after the loop_node comes SkillAssessment.

After SkillAssessment comes the xor_node.

After the xor_node comes ManagerialReview.

After ManagerialReview comes FinalDecision.

Additionally, the loop_node itself is an operator (LOOP) with the two activities DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.

Wait, the loop_node is an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP, children = [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo].

The XOR node is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR, children = [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck].

Therefore, the unfair model's StrictPartialOrder would include all these nodes, with the dependencies as described.

Now, the fair model would replace the XOR with a single CulturalFitCheck activity. So instead of the XOR operator, after SkillAssessment comes the CulturalFitCheck directly, then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Now, constructing the models step by step.

First, the Unfair model:

First, define all the activities and operators:

Activities:

- ReceiveApplication (Transition("ReceiveApplication"))
- DataCompletenessCheck = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck"
- RequestMoreInfo = Transition("RequestMoreInfo"
- SkillAssessment = Transition("SkillAssessment"
- CulturalFitCheck = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
- CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
- ManagerialReview = Transition("ManagerialReview")
- FinalDecision = Transition("FinalDecision")

Operators:

The loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.L OOP (LOOP), children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

The xor_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, children [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Now, building the StrictPartialOrder for the unfair model:

The nodes in the StrictPartialOrder would be:

The list of all nodes:

[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_node, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

The dependencies:

- ReceiveApplication must be before loop_node.

- loop_node must be before SkillAssessment.

- SkillAssessment must be before xor_node.

- xor_node must be before ManagerialReview.

- ManagerialReview must be before FinalDecision.

Additionally, the loop_node's own internal structure is handled by its own OperatorPOWL (the loop between Data and Request).

The xor_node's children are the two options. The XOR operator allows choosing between them, so whichever is taken, then ManagerialReview comes next.

Now, putting this into code structure using the POWL syntax.

Wait, the StrictPartialOrder needs to have all these nodes and the dependencies between them.

The fair model would have instead of the xor_node, a single CulturalFitCheck activity, so the sequence would be:

After SkillAssessment comes CulturalFitCheck (activity), then ManagerialReview, etc.

Thus, the fair model's nodes would have instead of the XOR operator, the CulturalFitCheck activity in that spot.

Now, let's write the code for the unfair model first.

Wait, but I need to structure this as a StrictPartialOrder with nodes and order edges.

The unfair model's StrictPartialOrder will have the following nodes:

1. ReceiveApplication (activity)
2. loop_node (OperatorPOWL LOOP between Data and Request)
3. SkillAssessment (activity)
4. xor_node (OperatorPOWL XOR between the two cultural checks)
5. ManagerialReview (activity)
6. FinalDecision (activity)

Additionally, within the loop_node's operator, the two activities are part of it.

The dependencies between the main nodes are:

ReceiveApplication must come before the loop_node.

loop_node must come before SkillAssessment.

SkillAssess must come before xor_node.

xor_node must come before ManagerialReview.

ManagerialReview before FinalDecision.

Thus, in the StrictPartialOrder's nodes list, all the above nodes (Receive, loop, Skill, xor, Managerial, Final).

Wait, but in the nodes list of the StrictPartialOrder, the nodes are all the operator nodes and the individual activities? Or the nodes are the operators and the individual activities are part of the operators?

Hmm, the StrictPartialOrder nodes are the top-level nodes of the model. Each operator (like the loop and xor) are themselves nodes in the partial order. The DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo are part of the loop_node (as its children). Similarly, the Cultural and Community are part of the xor_node's children.

Therefore, in the main StrictPartialOrder, the nodes are:

- ReceiveApplication (activity)
- The loop_node (the loop operator)
- SkillAssessment (activity)
- xor_node (the XOR operator)
- ManagerialReview (activity)
- FinalDecision (activity)

The dependencies between these nodes are as above.

Now, putting this into code. The code structure would be:

For the unfair model:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck (wait, no: the loop_node's children are the two activities DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo? Or the loop operator is between those two? The loop operator is created as OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP and children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo].

Wait, the loop is between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop_node is constructed as OperatorPOWL with operator=LOOP and children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo].

Wait, no, according to the POWL definition, the loop operator takes two sub-models A and B. The loop is * (A, B). So the first part is A (DataCheck), then decide whether to loop: if loop is needed, do B (RequestMore), then A again. So the loop is between the two.

Therefore, the loop_node is the OperatorPOWL with loop operator and children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo].

Then, the xor_node is an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator, children [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck].

Now, putting all the nodes into the StrictPartialOrder's nodes list, and set the dependencies.

The StrictPartialOrder nodes would be:

nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_node, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

The dependencies are:

- ReceiveApplication must be before loop_node (so an edge from ReceiveApplication to loop_node).

- loop_node must be before SkillAssessment (edge from loop_node to SkillAssessment).

- SkillAssess must be before xor_node (edge from SkillAssess to xor_node).

- xor_node must be before ManagerialReview (edge from xor_node to ManagerialReview).

- ManagerialReview must be before FinalDecision (edge from ManagerialReview to FinalDecision).

Thus, the code would construct the StrictPartialOrder with these nodes and edges.

Now, the second model (fair):

The fair model skips the XOR. After SkillAssessment comes the CulturalFitCheck (as an activity, not an operator), so the CulturalFitCheck is a regular Transition node, then ManagerialReview, etc.

So the fair model's nodes are:

ReceiveApplication  loop_node  SkillAssessment  CulturalFitCheck (activity)  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Thus, the nodes in the fair model's StrictPartialOrder would be:

nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

Dependencies:

ReceiveApplication  loop_node  SkillAssessment  CulturalFitCheck  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Now, putting this into code for both models.

But let me write this step by step.

First, for the unfair model:

First, define all the individual activities and operators:

Unfair Model:

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all the activity nodes
ReceiveApplication = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition("ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition("FinalDecision")

# Create the loop operator for the data check loop.
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.L OOP? Wait, the operator for the loop is Operator.L OOP (LOOP), which is Operator.L OOP. Wait, the Operator class has an enum, so perhaps the code uses Operator.L OOP (LOOP) as Operator.L OOP? Need to check the import. Since the user's example had Operator.XOR and Operator.L OOP.

Wait the code example had:

loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.L OOP, children=[A, B])

So here, for the loop_node, operator is Operator.L OOP.

So in code:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.L OOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Wait, but the order between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo is part of the loop's definition, so the loop's operator handles that.

Next, the XOR node for the unfair model:

xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Then, the main nodes of the overall StrictPartialOrder are:

nodes_list = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_node,
    SkillAssessment,
    xor_node,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]

Then, the order edges are:

The StrictPartialOrder's order is built by adding edges between these nodes.

The StrictPartialOrder is initialized with nodes_list, then adding edges:

root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_list)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssess)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssess, xor_node)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_node, ManagerialReview)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Wait, but the SkillAssessment is an activity, then comes the xor_node (the XOR operator).

Wait, the nodes_list includes the loop_node (operator), and the xor_node (operator). The other nodes are activities.

Now, for the fair model:

Fair model's nodes are:

nodes_fair = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_node,  # same as before, loop_node is the same as the unfair model's loop_node
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]

The edges would be:

ReceiveApplication  loop_node  SkillAssessment  CulturalFitCheck  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Thus, in the fair model's StrictPartialOrder:

root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_fair)
root_fair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)
root_fair.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root_fair.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Wait, but in the fair model, there's no XOR, so the CulturalFitCheck is a direct step after SkillAssessment.

Thus, the Fair model's cultural check is a direct activity, not an operator.

Now, putting this into code.

Wait, the problem requires the answer to be the two POWL models, written in code.

Now, writing the code for both models.

But I need to make sure all variables are defined properly.

Wait, but in code, perhaps in the unfair model:

Wait, the XOR operator in the unfair model includes the two activities (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) as its children. So in the unfair model's XOR operator, the children are those two transitions.

Now, in the unfair model's nodes are:

- All the individual activities plus the loop_node and xor_node operators.

Now, the code for the unfair model:

First, define all the activities.

Then, the loop_node as OperatorPOWL with Loop between Data and Request.

The xor_node as OperatorPOWL with XOR between the two cultural checks.

Then, the nodes in the StrictPartialOrder include all these.

Now, the fair model's nodes include the CulturalFitCheck activity instead of the XOR operator.

Now, putting all this together.

Wait, in the unfair model, after the SkillAssessment, the process takes either the CulturalFit or CommunityAffiliation path. So the XOR is the point where the two branches are chosen.

Thus, the unfair model's structure is built as described.

Now, writing the code for both models.

But the user wants the two models as code examples.

Now, the user's example code had something like:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

So following that structure.

Now, let me proceed.

First, the Unfair model's code:

# Define all the activities and operators for the unfair model
ReceiveApplication = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition("ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition("FinalDecision")

# Create the loop operator for data completeness
loop_node = OperatorPOWL( operator=Operator.L OOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Create the XOR operator between the two cultural checks
xor_node = OperatorPOWL( operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# The nodes list for the unfair model:
nodes_unfair = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_node,
    SkillAssessment,
    xor_node,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]

# Create the partial order
unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_unfair)

# Adding the dependencies:
unfair_model.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_node)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(xor_node, ManagerialReview)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Wait, but the SkillAssessment is an activity node, so the edges are between the nodes as per the dependencies.

Now, the fair model:

# Fair model
# The nodes are:
# ReceiveApplication, loop_node (same as before), same loop_node?), then SkillAssessment, then CulturalFitCheck (activity), not an operator), then the rest.

# So:

# Note: loop_node can be reused here, since the loop is same as in unfair.

# Define the fair model's nodes:
nodes_fair = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_node,  # same loop_node from before? Wait, but in the fair model, the loop_node is same as in the unfair, so maybe we can reuse variables. But in code, they can be the same objects. But to avoid reuse, maybe better to redefine.

Wait, perhaps in code, the loop_node is the same in both models? But since they are separate models, perhaps they can be separate variables. Hmm, but in the code, each model is separate. So for the fair model's loop_node is the same as the unfair's, but they can be the same object.

Proceeding.

So, for the fair model:

SkillAssessment is followed by CulturalFitCheck (activity), not operator).

Thus:

fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_node,  # the same loop_node? Or maybe not. Wait, in code, they can be separate instances, but in the problem, they can use same loop_node.

Wait, perhaps in code, the loop_node is part of both models, but in the fair model's nodes list, the loop_node is included.

Thus, the fair model's nodes are:

nodes_fair = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_node,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,  # activity, not an operator
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]

Then, the order edges are:

ReceiveApplication  loop_node  SkillAssessment  CulturalFitCheck  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Thus, in code:

fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_fair)
fair_model.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)
fair_model.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)
fair_model.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
fair_model.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
fair_model.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Wait, but in the fair model, after SkillAssessment comes CulturalFitCheck, which is an activity.

Now, checking if the code is correctly.

Wait, but in the unfair model, the xor_node is an operator node that includes the two cultural check options. So when the model runs, the XOR allows choosing either path, but in the fair model, it's a single activity.

Now, the fair model doesn't have the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity, since it's removed.

Thus, the fair model's activities include CulturalFitCheck but not CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Now, putting all this into code.

Now, the user probably wants the code written as per the required structure, using the given syntax.

Now, putting all together.

Wait, but in the problem's example, the loop structure is:

loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.L OOP, children=[A,B]

So the loop_node is constructed with the two activities.

Now, let me write the final code for each model.

But I need to ensure that all the nodes are added correctly.

Wait, in the unfair model's StrictPartialOrder, the nodes are:

- ReceiveApplication (Transition)

- loop_node (OperatorPOWL)

- SkillAssessment (Transition)

- xor_node (OperatorPOWL)

- ManagerialReview (Transition)

- FinalDecision (Transition)

Thus, the code for the unfair model's nodes list is as above.

Now, the fair model's nodes include CulturalFitCheck instead of the xor_node.

Now, putting this into code:

Now, the user wants the two models as per their description.

Now, I need to make sure that the loop is correctly, and the XOR is properly placed.

Now, the user's example had an example where the loop is first, then the XOR.

Now, let me write the code for both models step by step.

Starting with the unfair model:

POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:

The code would be something like:

# Unfair model

# Define the activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition("ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition("FinalDecision")

# Create the loop for data completeness
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.L OOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Create the XOR for cultural check
xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define all nodes in the unfair model's StrictPartialOrder:
nodes_unfair = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_node,
    SkillAssessment,
    xor_node,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]

# Create the partial order
unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes_unfair)

# Adding dependencies:
unfair_model.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_node)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(xor_node, ManagerialReview)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Wait, but the xor_node is an operator that contains the two cultural activities.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the fair model:

# Fair model
# Same loop_node as before (same loop operator)
# No xor_node, instead, have CulturalFitCheck as an activity.

# Define the fair model's nodes:
nodes_fair = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_node,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]

fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes_fair)

fair_model.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)
fair_model.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)
fair_model.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
fair_model.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
fair_model.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Wait, but in the fair model, there is no CommunityAffiliationCheck, so that activity is not part of the fair model's nodes.

Wait, in the nodes_fair list, the CulturalFitCheck is present, but CommunityAffiliationCheck is not part of it.

Thus, the fair model does not include the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity, since it's removed.

Now, the problem also has the initial DataCompletenessCheck loop.

Now, checking all steps.

Now, also, the problem mentions that the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo, which is handled by the loop_node.

Thus, the code for the unfair model includes all these elements.

Now, the final code for both models.

Now, to write this properly, making sure the variable names are correct. I might have a typo in the names, like SkillAssessment vs SkillAssessment. Let me correct any typos.

Wait, in the problem's process description, the steps are:

After the loop comes the Skill Assessment, then the cultural check.

Wait, the SkillAssessment activity comes after the loop.

Yes.

Now, the problem mentions that in the unfair model, the cultural check is an XOR between the standard and the community check, while in the fair model, it's a single CulturalFitCheck.

Thus, the code should be as above.

Now, putting it all together in code.

Now, the user might also have a DataCompletenessCheck activity and RequestMoreInfo activity in the loop.

Therefore, the code for the unfair model is as above.

Now, I can write the code as per the problem's required syntax.

Now, the user's example used:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])

So in code, the nodes are the operators and activities.

Now, let me write the code for both models as per their structure.

Now, the final answer would have both
