Here’s a high-level segmentation of the event log into activities, with the rationale based on sensor signatures. I segmented when multiple signals changed together (temperature, vibration, flow, pressure, energy, tool motion), then labeled each stable segment by its characteristic pattern.

Detected activities and rationale

- Events 1–3 and 13–15: Idle / Standby (return-to-home)
  - Signature: ambient temperature ~20–21°C, pressure 1 bar, vibration 0 Hz, material flow 0, tool position 0 mm (at end, returns to 0), low standby energy ~0.4–0.5 kWh.
  - Why: No motion or process load; typical machine idle/ready and end-of-cycle home.

- Events 4–6: Cutting Metal (material removal)
  - Signature: temperature rises sharply (5058°C), vibration increases and is sustained (3038 Hz), material flow high and steady (5 units/s), tool position advances (510 mm), energy increases (2.03.0 kWh), slight pressure rise (11.5 bar).
  - Why: Active tool engagement with feed (flow), rising heat and vibration, and continuous tool motion are consistent with cutting/milling/sawing.

- Events 7–8: Assembling / Fixturing (press/align)
  - Signature: temperature stabilizes lower (~40°C), pressure higher at 2 bar, vibration drops to a low steady 10 Hz, material flow reduced (2 units/s), tool reaches and holds 15 mm (two identical readings suggest dwell), energy steady at ~2.0 kWh.
  - Why: Elevated pressure with a held position and low vibration indicates clamping/pressing or fixture alignment rather than cutting.

- Event 9: Welding
  - Signature: temperature spike to 80°C, vibration peak at 50 Hz, material flow 0, tool position held at 15 mm, energy jumps to 5.0 kWh, pressure remains at 2 bar.
  - Why: High heat and power with no feed motion and a stationary tool strongly indicate a welding operation.

- Event 10: Cooling / Release
  - Signature: temperature drops to 30°C, vibration near zero (1 Hz), flow 0, energy falls to 1.0 kWh, tool still at 15 mm.
  - Why: Post-weld quiescent period likely for cooling and/or unclamping before moving the part.

- Events 11–12: Quality Inspection and Outfeed
  - Signature: low/stable temperature (25°C), low vibration (5 Hz), small material flow (1 unit/s), tool position moves slightly (1520 mm), moderate energy (1.5–1.6 kWh), pressure returns to 1 bar.
  - Why: Light movement and low loads with minimal flow suggest a measurement pass or gentle transfer to outfeed; pressure normalization supports end-of-process handling rather than forming.

Notes
- Packaging is not clearly present in this log; if packaging occurred on this machine, we would expect sustained low vibration with steady low-to-moderate material flow and repeated motions after inspection. Here, the machine returns to home immediately after a light-handling/inspection phase.
