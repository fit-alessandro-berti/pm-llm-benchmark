Below is an example of how you can create the temporal profile dictionary in Python:

```python
# Process variant frequencies and performances as dictionaries
process_variants = {
    'Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment': {'frequency': 56482, 'performance': 59591524.946},
    'Create Fine -> Payment': {'frequency': 46371, 'performance': 889688.400},
    'Create Fine -> Send Fine': {'frequency': 20385, 'performance': 8380516.026},

This script calculates the temporal profile by calculating the average and standard deviation of the times between activities for each process variant. It also includes a description of how to calculate these values.

Please note that this is just an example implementation and might need adjustments based on your specific requirements, such as handling edge cases or additional error checking.
