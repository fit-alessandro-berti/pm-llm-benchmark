**Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process**

### 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times:
| Case ID | Total Resolution Time          |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 101     | ~2h 15m (3/1 08:00 – 10:15)   |
| 102     | ~29h 10m (3/1 08:05 – 3/2 09:15) |
| 103     | ~1h 40m (3/1 08:10 – 09:30)   |
| 104     | ~13h 10m (3/1 08:20 – 3/2 08:30)|
| 105     | ~52h 5m (3/1 08:25 – 3/3 09:30)|

**Slowest Cases**: Cases 102, 104, and 105 exhibit delays of **15×**, **6.5×**, and **23×** the average ( Cases 101+103 average 2.3h). Case 105 is particularly inefficient, taking almost two full days to resolve.

### 2. Root Causes of Performance Issues:
#### **a. Escalation Delays** (Cases 102, 105):
- **Problem**: Escalations to Level-2 Agents resulted in **long idle periods**:
  - Case 102: 3.5-hour delay between assignment and escalation (08:30  11:30) + 4-hour wait post-escalation (11:30  14:00).
  - Case 105: Escalation occurred 1.5 hours after assignment (09:00  10:00), followed by **32-hour investigation gap** (10:00  14:00 on 3/2).
- **Root Cause**: Escalation processes are **asynchronous**, requiring manual intervention and unclear handoffs between teams.

#### **b. Stalled Investigations** (Case 104):
- **Problem**: After assignment, the agent waited **19 hours** (09:30  08:00 next day) before starting investigation.
- **Root Cause**: Combined factors:
  1. **Agent workloads**: Level-1 Agents were overloaded, causing delays in prioritizing tasks.
  2. **Lack of real-time tracking**: No system alerts or reminders to start investigations immediately post-assignment.

#### **c. Escalation-to-Resolution Gaps** (Cases 102, 105):
- **Problem**: Escalated tickets required **2+ days** to resolve (14:00 on 3/1  09:15/09:30 on 3/2/3).
- **Root Cause**: Level-2 Agents had insufficient capacity or expertise, leading to **rework and prolonged resolution**.

### 3. Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks:
#### **a. Escalation Process Optimization**:
- **Automated Escalation**: Implement a system that auto-escalates tickets after a **maximum allowed hold time** (e.g., 2 hours post-assignment).
- **Level-2 Agent Coverage**: Rotate Level-2 Agents to handle critical escalations in real time, reducing idle periods.
- **Escalation Metrics**: Track time between assignment and escalation, ensuring adherence to SLAs.

#### **b. Reduction of Idle Periods**:
- **Immediate Investigation Start**: Require Level-1 Agents to begin investigating within **1 hour of assignment** through system alerts.
- **Dynamic Workload Distribution**: Deploy a routing algorithm to assign tickets to agents with the nearest "rest time" to minimize idle capacity.

#### **c. Root Cause Elimination** (Case 104-style Delays):
- **Investigation Time Shadows**: sollenshadows h thng  phát hin tn thi gian ch i và nhc nh nhân viên.
- ** capacities Alignment**: Ensure Level-1 Agentenough to handle non-escalation tickets without constant escalation to Level-2.

#### **d. Data-Driven Monitoring**:
- **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard**: Monitor:
  - Time-to-assignment, time-to-investigation, and time-to-resolution.
  - Escalation frequency and associated delays.
  - Agent workload distribution.
- **AItranslator**: Predict delays using historical data (e.g., tickets with escalations take 2x longer to resolve) and auto-assign warnings.

### Final Insight:
The biggest Opportunity lies in **aligning escalation protocols with automated work tracking** and **striping human bottlenecks** through system-driven interventions. Cases 104 and 105 highlight critical failures in monitoring and workload planning, while Cases 102/105 showescalations are not doing more harm than good whenolve quy trình th công (case 104's 19-hour pause should be replaced by structured process steps like " Investigation must begin within 2 hours of assignment").
