### Analysis

#### POWL Model 1: 
The standard hire-to-retire workflow includes activities such as posting job ads, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding new employees, adding payroll, and closing cases. The order of these operations is explicitly defined in the `StrictPartialOrder` structure:

- **Post**  **Screen**
- **Screen**  **Interview**
- **Interview**  **Make_Hiring_Decision**
- **Make_Hiring_Decision**  **Onboard**
- **Onboard**  **Payroll**
- **Payroll**  **Close**

In this model, there are no anomalies that deviate from the standard process logic. Each step logically follows in sequence as expected for a typical hiring-to-retire workflow.

#### POWL Model 2:
The second model introduces several deviations:

1. **XOR Operator (`*`)**: An XOR operator is defined between `Payroll` and `Close`. This represents a non-standard decision point where the order of operations changes, which may not align with standard process logic.
   
2. **Silent Transition**: The presence of a "skip" transition (represented by an operator named "skip") indicates that there are no direct dependencies or logical constraints between these two steps.

3. **Loop Operator (`*`)**: While the loop is defined correctly, it introduces extra complexity compared to typical sequential processes like those in a standard hire-to-retire model.

4. **Partial Order**: The strict ordering of activities and operators may not hold when considering the XOR decision point, as there are no clear dependencies between these two transitions without additional context.

### Conclusion

The second POWL model more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process than Model 1. The inclusion of an XOR operator in its order and the use of silent transitions suggest deviations from standard logic that could lead to inconsistencies or anomalies if not properly accounted for. This is because:

- **Standardness**: In normal hire-to-retire workflows, there should be no deviation between steps; indeed, each step logically follows as expected.
  
- **Non-normative Operations**: The XOR and silent transitions introduce complexity that can undermine the process's integrity by introducing non-standard decision points or skipping operations without proper context.

Model 2 deviates from a normative structure because it includes elements (XOR operator) and lacks explicit dependencies between steps, which are typically required to maintain consistency in an idealized hiring-to-retire workflow.
