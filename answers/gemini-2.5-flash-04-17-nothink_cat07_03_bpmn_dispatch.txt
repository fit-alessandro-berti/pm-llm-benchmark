The visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process of dispatching goods at a Computer Hardware Shop. The diagram is divided into three swimlanes representing different roles or departments: Logistics, Secretary, and Warehouse.

The process starts with "Ship goods" in the Secretary swimlane. From there, the process splits into two parallel paths.

In the upper path within the Secretary swimlane, the process clarifies the shipment method. It then checks if special handling is required.
- If special handling is not required ("no"), the process checks if insurance is required, referencing customer information.
- If special handling is required ("yes"), the process proceeds to get three offers from logistic companies and then selects a logistic company and places an order.

Following the check for insurance in the Secretary swimlane, if insurance is necessary, the process moves to the Logistics swimlane to "Insure parcel". Regardless of whether insurance was necessary, the process then transitions back to the Secretary swimlane to "Write package label". After writing the package label, the process joins with the path that handled special handling.

In the lower parallel path starting from the initial split in the Secretary swimlane, the process moves to the Warehouse swimlane to "Package goods". A timer is attached to this task, indicating a potential delay of 48 hours. If there is a delay, the process triggers the task "Notify customer about delay" in the Warehouse swimlane, which then merges back into the main flow.

After packaging the goods (and potentially notifying the customer about a delay), the process in the Warehouse swimlane joins the flow coming from the Secretary swimlane after writing the package label.

Once the two paths merge, the process in the Warehouse swimlane proceeds to "Fill out Shipment paperwork". Finally, the process moves the "Move package to pickup area", culminating in the "Shipment prepared" end event.

The diagram utilizes various BPMN symbols including start events (circles), tasks (rounded rectangles), parallel gateways (diamonds with a plus), exclusive gateways (diamonds with an X), inclusive gateways (diamonds with a circle), data objects (folded-corner rectangles), and data stores (cylinders), illustrating the flow and decision points within the business process.
