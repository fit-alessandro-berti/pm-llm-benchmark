### Anomaly Identification

1. **Contradictory Constraints in DECLARE Model:**
   - **Precedence and Non-Co-Existence Anomaly:** The precedence rule states that the closing of a claim (`C`) must be preceded by the receiving of a claim (`R`). However, the non-co-existence rule specifies that an evaluation (`E`) must not co-exist with closing (`C`). This conflicts with the intended process flow where the closing of a claim should follow its evaluation. If a claim is closed without evaluation, this would violate the business logic.
   - **Responded Existence Anomaly:** The responded existence rule suggests that an evaluation (`E`) must be preceded by an assignment (`A`). This is correct, but missing rules for other activities like `P` (Approve) and `N` (Notify) could lead to incomplete execution paths. For instance, a claim might be evaluated but never approved or notified to the customer.

2. **Undesired Execution Paths:**
   - **Skipped Evaluation:** If a claim is closed (`C`) without evaluation (`E`), it would break the intended process and might indicate a critical anomaly.
   - **Missing Approval and Notification:** There are no explicit rules for `P` (Approve) and `N` (Notify), which could allow for execution paths where a claim is evaluated and then closed without approval or notification to the customer.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements:** The DECLARE model might have been built based on an incomplete understanding of the business process, leading to missing or incorrect constraints.
2. **Incremental Policy Changes:** Over time, the business process may have evolved, but the DECLARE model was not updated to reflect these changes, causing inconsistencies.
3. **Technical Issues or Incomplete Data:** Errors in data collection or processing could lead to incorrect constraints being applied, such as missing key activities in the flow.
4. **Operational Pressure:** To expedite claim processing, certain steps might be bypassed, leading to anomalies in the DECLARE model that allow such shortcuts.

### SQL-Based Investigation Strategies

1. **Find Claims Closed Without Evaluation:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE claim_id IN (
       SELECT claim_id
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity = 'C'
   ) AND claim_id NOT IN (
       SELECT claim_id
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity = 'E'
   );
   ```

2. **Traces Where Evaluation and Closing Coexist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE claim_id IN (
       SELECT claim_id
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity = 'E'
   ) AND claim_id IN (
       SELECT claim_id
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity = 'C'
   );
   ```

3. **Identify Evaluation Steps Without Corresponding Assignment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'E' AND claim_id NOT IN (
       SELECT claim_id
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity = 'A'
   );
   ```

4. **Check for Claims Evaluated Without Subsequent Approval or Notification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'E' AND claim_id NOT IN (
       SELECT claim_id
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
   );
   ```

5. **Verify Closing Claims After Approval and Notification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'C' AND claim_id NOT IN (
       SELECT claim_id
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
   );
   ```

These SQL queries will help identify specific instances where the DECLARE model’s constraints are violated, providing insights into the anomalies within the insurance claim process.
