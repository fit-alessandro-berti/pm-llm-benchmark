Here are the opposite concepts, more general concepts, and explanations for each of the given Petri net concepts:

1. **Source Place**
	* Opposite concept: **Sink Place** - A place that has no outgoing arcs, i.e., a place that tokens can only enter but not leave.
	* More general concept: **Place** - A generic concept that represents a location where tokens can reside, without specifying whether it is a source, sink, or intermediate place.
2. **Immediate Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Timed Transition** - A transition that has a delay or a specific time interval associated with its firing, i.e., it does not fire immediately when enabled.
	* More general concept: **Transition** - A generic concept that represents an event or an action that can occur in the Petri net, without specifying whether it is immediate or timed.
3. **Live Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Dead Transition** - A transition that can never fire, i.e., it is never enabled or it has a condition that is never satisfied.
	* More general concept: **Active Transition** - A transition that is enabled and can potentially fire, without specifying whether it is live or dead.
4. **Bounded Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Unbounded Net** - A Petri net in which there is no upper bound on the number of tokens that can accumulate in one or more places.
	* More general concept: **Petri Net** - A generic concept that represents a discrete event system, without specifying whether it has bounded or unbounded token growth.
5. **Free Choice Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Conflict-Restricted Net** - A Petri net in which the firing of one transition may conflict with the firing of another transition, i.e., the net is not free-choice.
	* More general concept: **Non-Deterministic Net** - A Petri net in which the firing of transitions is not uniquely determined by the net's marking, without specifying whether it is free-choice or conflict-restricted.

These opposite and more general concepts are not necessarily standard in the Petri net literature, but they provide a way to think about the opposite or more general ideas for each of the given concepts.
