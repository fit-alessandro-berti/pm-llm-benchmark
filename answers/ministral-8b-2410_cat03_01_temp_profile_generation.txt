Sure, let's create a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay process. This process typically involves activities such as "Purchase Request", "Approval", "Receipt", "Invoice Processing", and "Payment". We'll assume some average and standard deviation values for the times between these activities.

Here's a possible temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Purchase Request', 'Approval'): (24 * 60 * 60, 1 * 60 * 60),  # Average: 1 day, Standard Deviation: 1 hour
    ('Approval', 'Receipt'): (8 * 60 * 60, 2 * 60 * 60),          # Average: 8 hours, Standard Deviation: 2 hours
    ('Receipt', 'Invoice Processing'): (4 * 60 * 60, 1 * 60 * 60), # Average: 4 hours, Standard Deviation: 1 hour
    ('Invoice Processing', 'Payment'): (1 * 60 * 60, 30 * 60),     # Average: 1 hour, Standard Deviation: 30 minutes
    ('Payment', 'Close'): (1 * 60 * 60, 15 * 60)                 # Average: 1 hour, Standard Deviation: 15 minutes
}

for key, value in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"{key}: Average = {value[0] // (60 * 60)} hours, Standard Deviation = {value[1] // (60 * 60)} hours")
```

Explanation:
- **('Purchase Request', 'Approval')**: The average time between these activities is 1 day, with a standard deviation of 1 hour.
- **('Approval', 'Receipt')**: The average time is 8 hours, with a standard deviation of 2 hours.
- **('Receipt', 'Invoice Processing')**: The average time is 4 hours, with a standard deviation of 1 hour.
- **('Invoice Processing', 'Payment')**: The average time is 1 hour, with a standard deviation of 30 minutes.
- **('Payment', 'Close')**: The average time is 1 hour, with a standard deviation of 15 minutes.

This profile represents a simplified model of the Purchase-to-Pay process. The actual values may vary depending on the specific organization and its processes.
