## 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

### a) Mining for Shared Cold-Packing Contention
- Extract “Packing START” and “Packing COMPLETE” events for orders with `Requires Cold Packing = TRUE`.  
- Compute per-station occupancy intervals and build a resource-level timeline of the five cold-packing stations.  
- Measure for each order:
  - **Cold-Pack Wait Time** = time between end of previous step (“Item Picking COMPLETE”) and start of cold-packing.  
  - **Queue Length** at the order’s arrival instant (number of other orders waiting or in service).  
- Aggregate these to get average, percentile, and peak wait times and station utilization rates.

### b) Quantifying Shipping-Batch Delays
- Identify batch groupings: group orders by Destination Region and batch identifier (e.g., “Batch B1”).  
- For each order, compute:
  - **Batch Formation Delay** = time from step ready for label generation to actual “Shipping Label Generation START.”  
- Track distribution of batch sizes and inter-arrival times of batch triggers.  
- Derive regional histograms of batch delays and idle times of the label-generation system.

### c) Measuring Priority Order Impact
- Label orders as Express or Standard.  
- For each interruption in an activity on a shared resource (packing station, QC station), detect preemption events:
  - Compare the scheduled interval of a standard order against a later timestamp when an express order seizes the same station.  
- Compute:
  - **Preemption Delay** = extra waiting time injected into the standard order.  
  - **Express Speedup** = reduction in total lead time for express vs. baseline.

### d) Capturing Hazardous-Material Throughput Limits
- Identify orders flagged Hazardous Material.  
- Count concurrent activities “Packing” or “Quality Check” for these orders at every timestamp.  
- Compute:
  - **Constraint Violations** (if counts exceed 10).  
  - **Hazardous-Order Wait Time** when count = 10 and additional hazardous orders queue.  
- Contrast throughput rates of hazardous vs. non-hazardous flows to show lost capacity.

### e) Differentiating Within- vs. Between-Instance Wait
- For each order step:
  - **Expected Duration** = historical mean activity time (e.g., average picking duration without wait).  
  - **Observed Duration** = recorded COMPLETESTART interval.  
- **Within-Instance Delay** = max(0, Observed Duration  Expected Duration).  
- **Between-Instance Delay** = (StartTime of activity)  (CompleteTime of previous activity) minus any planned inter-step delay (e.g., batching window).  
- Tag each waiting segment as “resource contention,” “batching,” or “natural idle” based on context.

## 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

- **Express vs. Cold-Pack Queue**  
  - Express cold-packing arrivals often preempt standard jobs. This shifts standard orders to later service intervals, amplifying station queue lengths for non-perishables.  
  - Peak express surges (e.g., overnight flash sales) can push cold-pack utilization above safe margins, causing spill-over into standard stations if cross-compatible.

- **Batching & Hazardous Limits**  
  - If a region’s batch window hits the regulatory cap of 10 concurrent hazardous orders in QC or packing, either:
    1. Batching is delayed until some hazardous orders clear, or  
    2. Non-hazardous items are batched alone, reducing shipping efficiency.  
  - In practice, South-bound hazardous orders often collide in the same batch window, creating artificial backlogs.

- **Cascading Effects**  
  - Delay in hazardous-order packing reduces capacity for express perishables if they share cold-pack or QC resources.  
  - Long shipping-batch waits worsen perishable shelf-life risks, potentially triggering manual overrides that break standard batching rules and reduce overall efficiency.

Understanding these overlaps is crucial to avoid local optimizations that make global performance worse (e.g., adding a cold-pack station without adjusting hazardous throughput might simply shift a bottleneck to QC).

## 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

### Strategy A: Dynamic Resource Allocation & Cross-Training
- **Targets:** Shared Cold-Packing contention, Priority Preemption  
- **Changes:**
  - Cross-train two standard packing stations per shift to handle cold-packing when utilization > 80%.  
  - Implement a rule-based dispatcher that:
    1. Monitors real-time station queues.  
    2. Dynamically reallocates staff to open a cross-trained station for perishables when express lead time exceeds threshold.  
- **Data Leverage:** Predict demand peaks via time-series analysis of cold-pack arrivals and express order forecasts.  
- **Expected Outcomes:**  
  - 25–40% reduction in perorder wait time at coldpacking during peaks.  
  - Fewer express preemptions on standard stations, smoothing backlog.

### Strategy B: Adaptive Batch Formation Logic
- **Targets:** Shipping Batch Delay, Hazardous Material interaction  
- **Changes:**
  - Replace fixedsize or fixedtime batches with a “dynamic trigger” that fires when either:
    1. A minimum batch size is reached, or  
    2. Maximum wait threshold (e.g., 15 minutes) is reached.  
  - Incorporate hazardous count check: if > 8 hazardous orders are pending, trigger an immediate “hazardousonly” minibatch to clear slots.  
- **Data Leverage:** Historical interarrival distributions per region to optimize threshold parameters.  
- **Expected Outcomes:**  
  - 30% faster average batch formation.  
  - Reduced regulatory bottleneck by auto-flushing hazardous queues.

### Strategy C: Priority-Aware Scheduling with Time-Windows
- **Targets:** Priority Handling, Regulatory Compliance  
- **Changes:**
  - Introduce “time-window slots” for express orders in packing/QC: e.g., reserve 20% of capacity per hour for express.  
  - Enforce at most 8 concurrent hazardous processes by deferring lowurgency hazardous items to next slot if the limit is near.  
  - Implement a weighted fairqueuing algorithm that balances standard, express, and hazardous workloads.  
- **Data Leverage:** Weight factors tuned via simulation on historical loads.  
- **Expected Outcomes:**  
  - Predictable express lead times (e.g., 90% under SLA).  
  - Zero regulatory violations; improved compliance without hurting overall throughput.

## 4. Simulation and Validation

- **Modeling Approach:** Build a discrete-event simulation of the fulfillment center, importing the mined process model parameters (activity time distributions, inter-arrival patterns, resource pools).  
- **Key Elements to Capture:**
  - Resource pools: standard vs. cold-pack stations, QC stations.  
  - Eventdriven priority preemption logic.  
  - Batch triggers and shipping label generation as grouped events.  
  - Global constraint on concurrent hazardous orders.  
- **Validation Scenarios:**
  1. **Baseline Run:** current configuration to benchmark cycle time, throughput, wait times.  
  2. **Strategy A/B/C Runs:** individually and in combination.  
- **KPIs to Measure:**  
  - Average end-to-end lead time per order type.  
  - 95th percentile perstep waiting times (cold-pack queue, batch delay).  
  - Hazardous queue lengths and any constraint breaches.  
  - Resource utilization profiles.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Vary expressorder ratios (e.g., 20%, 50%), seasonal peaks, hazardousorder mix to ensure robustness.

## 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

### Key Metrics and Dashboards
- **Real-Time Queue Monitoring:**
  - Cold-Packing queue length and average wait.  
  - Packing/QC active hazardous count (must stay  10).  
- **Batch Flow Metrics:**
  - Batch formation interval distributions by region.  
  - Average batch size and batch delay.  
- **Priority SLA Tracking:**
  - % of express orders meeting per-step and end-to-end SLAs.  
  - Number and impact of preemptions on standard orders.  
- **Resource Utilization:**
  - Hourly utilization of standard vs. cold-pack stations.  
  - Number of dynamically cross-trained station activations.

### Process-Mining Dashboards
- **Variant Explorer:** track emerging process variants (e.g., new bypass flows when constraints trigger).  
- **Performance Overlays:** highlight where instance-spanning delays occur on the process map (color-coded by waiting time causes).  
- **Compliance Gauge:** real-time count of hazardous orders in critical steps, with alerts for approaching limits.

By continuously correlating these metrics with order throughput and lead times, the team can verify that instance-spanning constraints are alleviated, ensure no new bottlenecks emerge, and fine-tune policies in an ongoing, data-driven manner.
