Below is the event log transformed for import into a process-mining tool. Events have been grouped into cases based on the document/email/PDF/spreadsheet the user was working on, and low-level actions have been mapped to higher-level activities.

**Explanation of grouping and naming logic:**

1. **Case Identification (Case ID):**  
   - We created one case per distinct “object” the user worked on (two Word documents, one email thread, one PDF, one Excel file).  
   - Even though the user returned to Document1.docx in two separate time blocks, both belong to “Case_DOC1.”  

2. **Activity Naming:**  
   - Low-level events have been mapped to higher-level, process-relevant steps:  
     - FOCUS  Open [Document/PDF/Spreadsheet] or, on reopen, the same “Open” activity.  
     - TYPING in Word  Edit Document.  
     - SAVE  Save Document (or Save Spreadsheet).  
     - CLICK Reply to Email or Open Email, depending on context.  
     - SCROLL in email/PDF  Scroll Email or Scroll PDF.  
     - HIGHLIGHT  Highlight Text.  
     - TYPING in email  Write Email.  
     - SEND action  Send Email.  
   - SWITCH events have been omitted, as they serve primarily to signal context change between cases rather than a step within a case.  

3. **Timestamps:**  
   - We retained the original ISO8601 timestamps (with millisecond precision) for precise temporal ordering.  

4. **Additional Attributes (Application & Object):**  
   - While only Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp are strictly required, including the application and object name (e.g., filename or email subject) will help analysts filter and drill down by process instance.  

This log is now ready for import into any process-mining tool (e.g., ProM, Disco, Celonis), where you can analyze throughput times, bottlenecks, and variant behaviors across these five distinct work cases.
