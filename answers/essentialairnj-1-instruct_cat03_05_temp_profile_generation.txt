**Note:** The provided temporal profile dictionary includes pairs of activities that appear in the event logs and may be separated by multiple steps, assigning estimated average times and standard deviations. These values should be adjusted in an actual implementation to reflect more precise estimations based on detailed process analysis and historical data. 

**The temporal profile dictionary is a crucial input for detecting anomalies in process execution times with respect to the typical expected durations.**: 

**An example of an anomaly in this context could be:** An execution of the process showed an extremely short time between Quality Inspection and Product Testing, e.g., 1 minute, which is significantly below the expected average time of ~72 hours with a standard deviation of ~12 hours.

**Based on the provided temporal profile**, a deviation occurs when the observed time between two activities in a particular execution is either significantly lower than `(average_time - ZETA * std_dev)` or significantly higher than `(average_time + ZETA * std_dev)` where `ZETA` is a given positive value (e.g., ZETA=3 for a 99% confidence level).

**This information can be utilized for detecting and rooting out process inefficiencies, optimizing process execution times, and enhancing overall supply chain performance.**
