## 1) Cases with significant performance issues (end-to-end lead time)

Baseline (“happy path”) cases **2001** and **2004** finish in ~**1.5 hours** with no rework.

| Case | Region | Complexity | Start  End | Total duration | # “Request Additional Documents” |
|------|--------|------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 2001 | A | Low | 2024-04-01 09:00  10:30 | **1h 30m** | 0 |
| 2004 | B | Low | 2024-04-01 09:20  10:45 | **1h 25m** | 0 |
| 2002 | B | Medium | 2024-04-01 09:05  2024-04-02 11:00 | **25h 55m** | 1 |
| 2003 | A | High | 2024-04-01 09:10  2024-04-03 09:30 | **48h 20m** | 2 |
| 2005 | B | High | 2024-04-01 09:25  2024-04-04 14:30 | **77h 05m** | 3 |

**Performance-issue cases:** **2002, 2003, 2005** (orders of magnitude longer than the low-complexity baseline).

## 2) What drives the long durations (where time is lost)

### A. The dominant delay pattern is the “Request Additional Documents” loop (rework + waiting)
The long cases all contain **Request Additional Documents**, and most of their cycle time is spent *between* those events and the next step (waiting for documents, follow-up, re-review).

**Case 2002 (Medium, Region B)**
- Biggest delay: **Request Docs (Apr1 14:00)  Approve (Apr2 10:00) = 20h**
- Interpretation: waiting for claimant response and/or next-day re-check.

**Case 2003 (High, Region A)**
- Rework: **2 document requests**
- Key delays:
  - Request Docs (Apr1 17:00)  Approve (Apr2 16:00) = **23h**
  - Approve (Apr2 16:00)  Pay (Apr3 09:00) = **17h** (likely payment cut-off / next-day batch)
- Interpretation: complex claim triggers multiple doc cycles + approval late in day pushes payment to next day.

**Case 2005 (High, Region B)**
- Rework: **3 document requests**
- Key delays (multi-day):
  - Request #1 (Apr1 11:30)  Request #2 (Apr2 17:00) = **29h 30m**
  - Request #2 (Apr2 17:00)  Request #3 (Apr3 15:00) = **22h**
  - Request #3 (Apr3 15:00)  Approve (Apr4 10:00) = **19h**
- Interpretation: repeated “missing/insufficient docs” cycles + long waiting windows dominate the case duration.

**Conclusion:** the main performance issue is not the straight-through processing steps; it’s **document-related rework and the waiting time it creates**.

## 3) Attribute-based root cause hypotheses (Resource, Region, Complexity)

### Complexity (strongest correlation)
- **Low complexity** (2001, 2004): no doc requests, finishes in ~**1.5h**
- **Medium** (2002): **1** doc request, finishes in ~**26h**
- **High** (2003, 2005): **2–3** doc requests, finishes in **48–77h**

**Root cause mechanism:** Higher complexity increases uncertainty and required evidence  more document requests and re-checks  more waiting and rework loops.

---

### Region (signal mainly visible for high complexity)
- Low complexity is fast in **both** regions (so region alone isn’t a baseline issue).
- High complexity differs: **Region A (2003) = 48h** vs **Region B (2005) = 77h**.

**Root cause hypotheses:**
- Region B may have stricter documentation/regulatory requirements for complex claims.
- Or claimants/partners in Region B respond slower.
- Or it’s actually a *resource/capacity* issue that is region-linked (same adjuster/finance staff serving that region).

*Note:* With only one high-complexity case per region, treat this as a hypothesis to validate with more data.

---

### Resource (likely interacts with complexity and region)
**Adjusters**
- Region A high complexity: handled by **Adjuster_Mike** (2003) with 2 doc requests and a shorter doc-loop than case 2005.
- Region B high complexity: handled by **Adjuster_Lisa** (2005) with 3 doc requests and much longer gaps between iterations.

**Root cause hypotheses:**
- **Workload/queueing:** Adjuster_Lisa may have higher WIP, slower follow-up cadence, or less capacity for high-complexity work.
- **Request quality:** repeated requests may indicate documents are requested incrementally (missing a full checklist up front) rather than in one complete request.

**Finance**
- Payment can add large delays depending on timing:
  - Case 2003: approval at **16:00**  paid next day **09:00** (**17h**) suggests a **daily payment batch / cut-off time**.
  - Case 2005: approval at **10:00**  pay at **14:00** (**4h**) suggests either **queueing** or **extra controls** for high complexity.

## 4) Explanations and mitigation actions

### A. Reduce document-related rework (biggest lever)
1. **“Right-first-time” submission**
   - Dynamic claim forms by complexity type (mandatory attachments, upfront validation rules).
   - Pre-submission checklist tailored by claim type/region.

2. **Consolidate document requests**
   - Replace multiple “Request Additional Documents” events with **one comprehensive request** wherever possible.
   - Use templates and standardized evidence lists (especially for high complexity).

3. **Tighten the doc waiting loop**
   - Automated reminders + escalation after X hours/days.
   - Customer portal for uploads and status visibility.
   - Add an explicit event like **“Documents Received”** to separate customer delay from internal delay (critical for root-cause proof).

---

### B. Complexity-based routing and staffing
- **Route high-complexity claims** to a specialized adjuster pool (or senior adjusters).
- Enforce **WIP limits** and load balancing (if Adjuster_Lisa/Region B is overloaded).
- Coaching: reduce “ping-pong” requests by improving initial evidence assessment.

---

### C. Remove approval/payment batching delays
- **Approval SLA**: target turnaround from “docs complete” to “approve” within same business day.
- **Payment cut-off optimization**:
  - More frequent payment runs or near-real-time payouts for approved claims under certain risk thresholds.
  - If approvals happen late day (like 16:00), enable **same-day payment** when possible.

---

### D. Region-specific standardization
If Region B truly needs more evidence:
- Provide **region-specific guidance at submission**, not after evaluation.
- Harmonize policies/process steps across regions where legally possible.

---

### Summary
- **Long cases:** 2002, 2003, 2005.
- **Primary root cause:** **Complexity-driven document rework** (multiple “Request Additional Documents”) + long waiting periods.
- **Secondary contributors:** potential **Region B / Adjuster_Lisa follow-up cadence or workload**, and **payment batching/cut-offs** for high-complexity cases.
- **Best mitigations:** improve upfront completeness, consolidate doc requests, enforce SLAs/automation in the doc loop, and reduce end-of-day approval-to-payment delays.
