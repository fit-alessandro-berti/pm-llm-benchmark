The picture is a BPMN-style swim-lane diagram that maps the end-to-end fulfilment of a customer order across four internal departments. Reading from left-to-right and top-to-bottom you can follow both the chronology of the work and the hand-offs between actors.

1. Structure of the diagram  
• Four horizontal lanes represent the responsible organisational units:  
  – Sales (top)  
  – Production  
  – Procurement  
  – Warehouse (bottom)  
• Within each lane solid black arrows are normal sequence flows; dashed arrows that cross lane borders are message flows (they show information or physical items that move from one area to another).  
• Circles = start/end events, rounded rectangles = activities, diamonds = decision gateways, double-lined rectangles = collapsed subprocess, document/DB icons = data objects.

2. Sales lane – “front office” order entry  
• A time-based start event labelled “Monday morning” kicks everything off.  
• The order is checked for completeness, then an exclusive gateway asks “Is the customer already in the database?”  
  – “No” path  task “Add customer to the database” then rejoins the main flow.  
• Sales sends the confirmed order details (message throw) to both the Production and Procurement lanes.  
• Sales then waits (intermediate message catch) for a “Product sent” message from Warehouse; once it arrives Sales drafts the invoice and the process ends for Sales.

3. Production lane – make the product  
• A message start event is triggered when order details arrive.  
• Production plans the job, then an exclusive gateway waits for a message event “Material not faulty” (sent by Procurement after inspection).  
  – If the materials are acceptable, Production manufactures the product and reaches an end event “Product complete”.  
  – A dashed message is sent to Warehouse to tell them the product is ready to ship.

4. Procurement lane – buy and inspect materials  
• Procurement also starts on the incoming “Order details” message.  
• It immediately launches a collapsed subprocess “Material Compensation” whose visible steps are:  
  – Order materials (with a looping connector to a task “Return material” in case anything must be sent back).  
• When the materials arrive the subprocess ends and the lane continues with “Check materials”.  
  – If material is bad, a boundary error event titled “Order cancellation” leads to a terminating end event.  
  – If the check passes, an intermediate message “Material not faulty” is thrown to Production, allowing manufacturing to proceed.

5. Warehouse lane – ship to the customer  
• Warehouse waits for the “Product complete” message.  
• It performs “Send product”; that task throws a “Product sent” message back to Sales and reaches its own end event.

6. Flow highlights and business meaning  
• The diagram captures two critical dependencies: Production cannot start until Procurement certifies material quality, and Sales cannot invoice until Warehouse confirms shipment.  
• All cross-department communication is asynchronous (message events), keeping each lane’s internal flow clear of external steps.  
• The use of a subprocess in Procurement shows that material-ordering details are abstracted away from the main view, while the potential return loop hints at quality-control feedback.  
• The Monday-morning timer start implies the process is batch-triggered each week, not on continuous demand.

Overall, the visualization gives a concise yet detailed blueprint of how a customer order is received, vetted, supplied with materials, manufactured, shipped and finally invoiced, with explicit decision points and error-handling paths built in.
