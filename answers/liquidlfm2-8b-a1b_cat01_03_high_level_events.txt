## Proposed High-Level Process Steps from Manufacturing Event Log

---

### 1. Material Preparation  
**Rationale:**  
This step encompasses all initial actions required to prepare raw materials for the manufacturing process, ensuring readiness for assembly.  
- Includes retrieving and inspecting the raw metal sheet (line curation).  
- Involves scanning barcode (identification) and placing on workstation (physical handling).  
- Aligning and preheating the material (setup and preparation), typically done before machining or welding.  
All these events occur early and sequentially on the same or similar resources (e.g., Operator A handling retrieval, scanning, positioning, and heating), indicating a coherent preparatory phase.  
**Contains high-level events:**  
- Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- Scan barcode  
- Place metal sheet on table  
- Align metal sheet  
- Preheat metal sheet  

**High-Level Activity:**  
**Material Preparation** — Preparing and condition the raw material for manufacturing, including verification, placement, alignment, and thermal setup.

### 2. Component Assembly  
**Rationale:**  
This phase involves physical assembly of the prepared component, combining parts and applying welding.  
- Welding corner A and B follows immediately, both requiring precise positioning and alignment.  
- Welding tools are picked up and reused, indicating process continuity.  
- Welding actions are indistinguishable in timing and resource allocation, suggesting a single coordinated operation window.  
All events cluster around physical joining operations with common tools and resources.  
**Contains high-level events:**  
- Pick up welding tool  
- Weld corner A  
- Weld corner B  
- Measure weld integrity  
- Apply protective coating  
- Dry coating  

**High-Level Activity:**  
**Component Assembly & Welding** — Sequential welding operations followed by coating application, representing the core fabrication phase.

### 3. Quality Inspection  
**Rationale:**  
Inspection is a discrete, critical phase to verify weld integrity and component quality.  
- The integrity measurement by Quality Sensor #1 occurs directly after welding, showing immediate validation.  
- Visual check (passed) occurs at the end of the case, possibly confirming final pass/fail.  
- This event is temporally and logically isolated from preparation and assembly, respecting workflow sequence.  
**Contains high-level events:**  
- Measure weld integrity  
- Visual check  

**High-Level Activity:**  
**Welding Verification & Quality Check** — Validation of weld quality and final visual inspection, ensuring process output meets standards.

| **Material Preparation**          | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet | All preparatory actions to set up and condition the raw material for assembly. Ensures material readiness and proper setup. |
| **Component Assembly & Welding** | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B, Measure weld integrity, Apply protective coating, Dry coating | Coordinated welding and coating steps emphasizing physical joining and surface finishing of the component. |
| **Quality Inspection**            | Measure weld integrity, Visual check                                                              | Validation of weld quality and final visual assessment to confirm meeting specifications before finalization. |

## Additional Notes  
- Events by **operator or machine type** grouped where actions are performed by same resource, reflecting consistent workflows.  
- Temporal proximity and logical dependencies were primary criteria for grouping.  
- Each high-level activity abstracts repetitive or dependent low-level tasks into coherent, domain-specific stages.  
- This grouping enables high-level monitoring, process analysis, and anomaly detection at key manufacturing phases.
