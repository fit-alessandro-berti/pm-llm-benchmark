We need to identify violations based on normative flow.

Cases:

1: Normal flow: Receive, Check, Authorize payment, Package, Ship, Close. This matches expected normal path (inventory sufficient). No violations.

2: Sequence: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize payment, Ship, Close. Here they package before authorizing payment, which violates "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping". Also authorize payment after packaging is also violation (should be before). However they still authorize before shipping but after packaging. So violation: authorize payment after packaging; also package before authorization. Also after check, expected next is authorize payment before packaging; here they package first. So case 2 violates.

Also any other issues? They still authorize payment before shipping, which is okay, but the ordering of package vs authorize is reversed. Also they close after shipping, okay.

3: Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order. Here they cancel after authorize payment, but then they still ship order after cancellation. That's definitely a violation: shipping should not occur after cancellation; also cancel should lead to close, not continue to ship. Also shipping after cancel is violation. Also authorize payment before cancel is okay? In cancellation scenario, after check inventory insufficient, they should go directly to Cancel order, then Close order. Here they authorize payment before cancel, which is not typical; also they still ship after cancel. So multiple violations.

Also check inventory step is followed by authorize payment (normal), but then they go to cancel. That's okay if inventory insufficient, but they shouldn't authorize payment before cancel? Actually normative says if insufficient inventory, after checking inventory the process should directly proceed to Cancel order. So authorize payment should not happen before cancel. So violation: authorize payment occurs before cancel, and shipping occurs after cancel.

4: Sequence: Receive, Check, Cancel order, Close order. This matches insufficient inventory scenario: Cancel then Close. No other activities. This seems compliant. However note that after cancel they close, correct. No shipping or packaging. So case 4 is fine.

5: Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order. Missing Package items. The normative says after authorization, items should be prepared for shipment (Package items) before shipping. So shipping before packaging is a violation. Also package step omitted; but is it a violation? The description says "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped." So shipping without packaging is a violation. Also they never package. So case 5 violates.

Also check if any other anomalies: No.

Thus violated cases: 2, 3, 5.

Now need explanation referencing textual description and interpreting ambiguities.

Potential nuance: case 2 also includes authorize payment after package, but still before shipping; but normative expects authorize before package. So violation.

Case 3 also includes authorize payment before cancel, but also shipping after cancel; both violations.

Case 5 missing package step; but maybe could be considered acceptable if packaging is implicit? But normative explicitly says package items must occur after authorization and before shipping. So it's a violation.

Also case 1 is fine.

Now produce answer.

**1. Cases that violate the normative process**

| Case ID | Violations (short description) |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| **2**   | Packages items **before** authorising payment; authorisation occurs after packaging. |
| **3**   | Authorises payment **before** cancelling the order, and **ships** the order **after** a cancellation has been recorded. |
| **5**   | **Ships** the order without ever performing the “Package items” activity (i.e., shipping occurs before packaging). |

**2. Why each case is a violation – stepbystep comparison with the textual description**

| Normative rule (from the textual description) | What the rule demands | How the case deviates |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| **a. “Check inventory” must occur before any decision about payment authorization or fulfillment.** | After *Receive order* the next logical activity is *Check inventory*. | All cases satisfy this; no violation here. |
| **b. “Authorize payment” must occur **after** “Check inventory” and **before** “Package items”.** | Payment can only be authorised once we know whether the stock is sufficient, and it must be done **prior** to any physical handling of the goods. | **Case2** – *Authorize payment* appears **after** *Package items*. The correct order should be *Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order*. <br> **Case5** – *Authorize payment* is followed directly by *Ship order* with no *Package items* inbetween, breaking the “authorisation  packaging  shipping” sequence. |
| **c. “Package items” must occur **after** authorization and **before** “Ship order”.** | Items are physically prepared for dispatch only after payment is authorised. | **Case2** – *Package items* is executed **before** authorisation, reversing the required order. <br> **Case5** – *Package items* never appears; shipping proceeds directly after authorisation, which contravenes the “packaging before shipping” rule. |
| **d. “Ship order” may only occur after “Package items” and must never follow a “Cancel order”.** | Shipping is the final fulfilment step; it is only legitimate when the order has been authorised, packaged and not cancelled. | **Case3** – After the order is cancelled, the log still records *Ship order* (and later *Close order*). Shipping after cancellation is expressly forbidden by the description (“once an order is cancelled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment … such as packaging or shipping”). |
| **e. “Cancel order” should be the direct next step after an insufficientinventory “Check inventory”, followed immediately by “Close order”.** | If the inventory check reveals insufficient stock, the process should branch to *Cancel order* and then *Close order*; no other fulfilmentrelated activities may intervene. | **Case3** – The log inserts *Authorize payment* **before** *Cancel order*. According to the normative description, after a *Check inventory* that shows insufficient stock, the very next activity must be *Cancel order*; authorising payment at this point is not allowed. |
| **f. “Close order” must be the final activity in every case.** | The process ends with *Close order*; no activities may follow it. | All cases end with *Close order*, so none violate this rule. |

### Interpretation of Ambiguities

1. **“Authorize payment before checking inventory?”**  
   The description explicitly states that *Authorize payment* must **follow** *Check inventory*. The only conceivable extraordinary circumstance would be a preauthorisation for a guaranteed payment method, but the normative model does **not** mention such an exception. Consequently, inserting *Authorize payment* before a *Check inventory* would be a clear breach. In our log, none of the cases do this, so we do not flag it as a violation.

2. **“Can a cancellation ever be preceded by other activities?”**  
   The text says: *“after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to ‘Cancel order.’”* The word *directly* leaves little room for intermediate steps. Therefore, any activity (e.g., *Authorize payment*) placed **before** a *Cancel order* after an inventory check is a deviation, as we see in Case3.

3. **“Is omitting ‘Package items’ ever permissible?”**  
   The normative description treats *Package items* as a mandatory step *after* authorisation and *before* shipping, emphasising that “items must be prepared before they can be shipped.” No optional wording is provided, so we treat the activity as obligatory. Hence, Case5, which ships without packaging, is a violation.

4. **“Can shipping be performed after a cancellation if the cancellation step is later overridden?”**  
   The description states that once an order is cancelled, “the next reasonable step is to ‘Close order’” and that activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping) become illogical after cancellation. This implies an absolute prohibition, not a conditional one. Therefore, any shipment that appears after a *Cancel order* is treated as a violation irrespective of timestamps or preceding authorisations.

### Summary of Violations

- **Case2** – Wrong ordering of *Authorize payment* and *Package items* (packages before authorisation).  
- **Case3** – *Authorize payment* occurs before the required *Cancel order* (contrary to the “directly proceed to Cancel order” rule) **and** the process ships after a cancellation, which is strictly forbidden.  
- **Case5** – *Ship order* occurs without an intervening *Package items* activity, violating the mandated “package before ship” sequence.

All other cases (1 and 4) conform to the normative flow and therefore are **not** flagged as violations.
