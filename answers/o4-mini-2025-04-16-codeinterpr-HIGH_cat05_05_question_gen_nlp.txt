1. Which segments of the supply chain—component sourcing, assembly, transportation, or distribution—pose the greatest risks to on-time delivery, and how might those risks be mitigated?  
2. How can the company balance cost, lead time, and quality when selecting among multiple international suppliers for critical components?  
3. In what ways could geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, or sudden regulatory changes in supplier countries disrupt the flow of materials, and what contingency plans would address such scenarios?  
4. How effective are just-in-time replenishment strategies in high-demand markets, and what safeguards exist to handle unexpected spikes or supply interruptions?  
5. Which key performance indicators and data sources provide the most actionable, real-time visibility into inventory levels across all global distribution centers?  
6. How might advanced analytics or machine learning models be further leveraged to enhance demand forecasting accuracy and reduce safety stock requirements?  
7. What environmental and labor compliance challenges vary by region, and what processes ensure consistent adherence across all suppliers and the assembly plant?  
8. How can transportation modes (air freight versus sea cargo) be optimized to minimize cost, lead time, and carbon footprint simultaneously?  
9. In the event of a product recall in a particular market, how can the company rapidly isolate affected batches while minimizing reputational harm and financial loss?  
10. What opportunities exist to streamline digital workflows for purchase orders, customs declarations, and regulatory filings across multiple jurisdictions?  
11. How might improved cross-functional collaboration between R&D, procurement, manufacturing, and logistics teams accelerate new model introductions and reduce time-to-market?  
12. To what extent do currency exchange rate fluctuations impact overall supply chain costs, and which hedging or invoicing strategies could mitigate these effects?  
13. Could nearshoring or diversifying assembly locations enhance supply chain resilience and reduce logistical complexity, and what trade-offs would that entail?  
14. How does variability in supplier quality metrics translate into downstream manufacturing inefficiencies or yield losses, and how can this be addressed through supplier development programs?  
15. What continuous improvement methodologies—such as Lean, Six Sigma, or Theory of Constraints—could be most effectively applied to reduce waste and increase throughput on the assembly lines?  
16. How can inventory management strategies be tailored differently for fast-moving versus slow-moving markets to optimize working capital and service levels?  
17. What ethical sourcing considerations (e.g., conflict minerals, labor standards) should be prioritized when procuring raw materials and components?  
18. In what ways could emerging technologies like blockchain, IoT sensors, or digital twins improve traceability, transparency, and risk management in the supply chain?  
19. What are the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a centralized versus decentralized network of distribution centers in terms of responsiveness, cost, and inventory risk?  
20. How can after-sales support, warranty claims, and field service data be better integrated into design and supplier selection decisions to drive continuous product and process improvement?
