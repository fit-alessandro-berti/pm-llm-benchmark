The main anomalies identified in your logs include:

1. The use of incorrect payment dates - Specifically, entries that appear to be due before or after a penalty date have been sent for payment.

2. The inclusion of "Not Applied" notifications - These are not actual payments made and therefore do not receive any kind of notification. They may also indicate an issue with the payment process or with the transaction itself.

3. A large number of anomalies in one period, such as 14 payments occurring over a month or more (5-6 months). This is unusual and could suggest issues in the processing of payments, possibly due to delays or errors.

4. The presence of multiple "Add PEnalties" notifications - It's possible that these are duplicates with different frequencies, performance indicators, or other details. This could indicate a need for further investigation.

5. Large number of anomalies occurring on specific dates and in different periods (e.g., 2 payments per day over a month). These could be indications that there are discrepancies or inconsistencies between the date tracking system and the actual payment process.

6. The use of inconsistent data formats - This might suggest errors or inconsistencies with the input, output, or processing logic.

7. Poor consistency in timing - For example, one or more payments occurring over a day but on different dates each week, indicating incorrect scheduling logic or inconsistencies in the processing flow. 

These anomalies highlight areas for further investigation into potential issues affecting payment process integrity and timeliness.
