The main differences between the treatment of the protected group (first) and the unprotected group (second) are as follows:

1. In the protected group, the process variants mostly start with "Register at ER" or "Register at FD," followed by various examinations, diagnoses, treatments, and discharges. In the unprotected group, the process variants mostly start with "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment" or "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment," indicating that the unprotected group undergoes more thorough examinations and expert evaluations.
2. The protected group has a lower frequency of successful treatment outcomes compared to the unprotected group. For example, in the protected group, only around 45% of the processes resulted in treatment success, while in the unprotected group, this percentage is much higher, with around 70% of the processes resulting in treatment success.
3. The average performance time (a lower value indicates better performance) is generally better in the unprotected group compared to the protected group. This could be due to the more specialized examinations and treatments provided to the unprotected group.
4. The protected group has more instances of treatment being unsuccessful, while the unprotected group has more instances of successful treatment and follow-up examinations. This suggests that the unprotected group has a better chance of successful treatment outcomes.

In summary, the main differences between the protected and unprotected groups are the types of examinations and treatments they receive, the success rates of their treatments, their average performance times, and the overall effectiveness of their healthcare processes. The unprotected group receives more specialized care, has higher treatment success rates, and has better average performance times compared to the protected group.
