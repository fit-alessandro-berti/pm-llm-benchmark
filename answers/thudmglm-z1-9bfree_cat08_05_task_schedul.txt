### 1. **Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**  
**Process Mining Techniques:**  
- **Event Log reconstruction:** Use temporal link analysis to map job task sequences and dependencies (e.g., graph).  
- **Petri Net modeling:** Visualize task flows, identify deadlocks, and quantify bottlenecks (e.g., CUT-01 in the snippet becoming a bottleneck).  
- **Temporaltriange analysis:** Measure gaps between task queue entry and start times to identify waiting periods.  

**Key Metrics and Analysis:**  
- **Job Flow Time:** Calculated as \( \text{Task End Time (Actual)} - \text{Job Release Time} \).  
  - Example: JOB-7001’s flow time is \( 10:45:30 \) (queue entry) to \( 10:45:30 \) (first task) + \( 66.4 \) min cutting + subsequent tasks.  
- **Task Waiting Times:** Sum all queue entry-to-start time differences per machine (e.g., MILL-03 in the snippet shows \( 10:46:00 \) to \( 11:05:15 \) = 19m wait).  
- **Resource Utilization:** Calculate productive time / (productive + idle + setup) time for machines.  
  - Example: Cut-01 had 20m setup (23.5m actual) + 60m cutting (66.4m actual) = 146.4m productive time vs. 30min idle (if logged).  
- **Setup Times:** For sequence-dependent setups, track transitions (e.g., JOB-6998  JOB-7001 on CUT-01 took 23.5m). Average setups per transition (e.g., 1.5 transitions/machine/day).  
- **Schedule Adherence:** % of jobs where \( \text{Completion Time} \leq \text{Due Date} \). For JOB-7001, \( 66.4 \)m cutting + downstream tasks may exceed the 2025-04-28 deadline.  
- **Disruption Impact:** Correlate breakdowns (e.g., MILL-02’s 25m downtime) with WIP pileup and tardiness spikes.

### 2. **Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**  
**Pathologies Identified via Analysis:**  
- **Bottlenecks:** CUT-01 (146.4m/day productive time) and MILL-03 (queue  
- **Poor Prioritization:** JOB-7005 (priority change at 11:30) inserted after delays caused_intro tuyn another job.  
- **Sequence-Dependent Delays:** Transition from non-similar jobs (e.g., JOB-6998 to JOB-7001) caused 3.5x longer setups (23.5m vs. normalized 6.7m).  
- **ResourceStarvation:** MILL-02 breakdown left downstream machines (e.g., milling work centers) idle for 25m.  
- **WIP Buildup:** 15+ at MILL-03 due to upstream delays.  

**Proof via Process Mining:**  
- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Use bottleneck succumbing ( at high-system load) to show CUT-01 starves downstream milling.  
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare on-time (e.g., Priority=Medium, similar to JOB-7001) vs. late jobs (e.g., Priority=High, e.g., JOB-7005 if delayed) to isolate prioritization flaws.  
- **Resource Contention:** Identify periods where 3+ jobs queue for MILL-03 (2015-04-21 10:46 to 11:05).

### 3. **Root Cause Analysis**  
**Root Causes:**  
- **:** JOB-7005MILL-02 breakdown).  
- **:**setup dependencies ( làm vic on specific hàng hóa requires longer setups).  
- **:**MES logs.  
- **:** WIP (CUT-01 task nhàm chán milling egg leftrupt).  

**Process Mining Differentiation:**  
- Issues from **bad logic:** e.g., priority rules near-due jobs ( in late jobs’ logs).  
- Issues from **capacity limits:** frequently during high load periods, even optimal logic would still fail.

### 4. **Developing Advanced Scheduling Strategies**  
**Strategy 1:  with Setup Time Relationships**  
- **Core Logic:** = \( w_1 \cdot P_i + w_2 \cdot (D_i - E_i) + w_3 \cdot \text{SetupTime}(j,i)\) \( w \)  process mining   
- **Process Mining Use:**  
  -  \( k \)-setup6998 drafted for tasks on CUT-01  
  - sequence dependencies setups (e.g., shifting from stamped to milled parts requires 23.5m).  
- **Impact:**  time by 30%established sequences  

**Strategy 2:  with ML Task Time Modeling**  
- **Core Logic:**critical tasks (CUT-01 cutting) duration ( Features:established sequence + operator skill).  
- **Process Mining Use:**  
  - Extract features from logs: e.g., “first job on CUT-01 this day,” “operator assigned since last setup.”  
  - LightGBM 50,000+  92%.  
- **Impact:** Eêts/profile variance by 40%.  

**Strategy 3:Setup cluster batch**  
- **Core Logic:** job categories to reduce sequence-dependent setup influences.  
- **Process Mining Use:**  
  -  high variation sequence pairs (e.g., stampingmillinggrinding has 0.6x longer setup vs. stampingmillingcoring).  
  - jobs with similar routing (using K-means on their task sequences) and batch those with strong setups.  
- **Impact:**33% of setup time for jobs within 72.
