**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

The following constraints were added to mitigate potential bias in the loan application process:

1.  **`coexistence("Reject_SeniorApplicant", "ManualReview")` and `coexistence("Reject_MinorityApplicant", "ManualReview")`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures that if a rejection decision (`Reject_SeniorApplicant` or `Reject_MinorityApplicant`) is recorded for an applicant belonging to a specific sensitive demographic group (modeled here via specialized activity names), a `ManualReview` activity *must* also occur within the same process instance (trace).
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** This enforces additional scrutiny and human oversight for potentially adverse decisions affecting protected groups, reducing the likelihood of automated or unchecked bias based on attributes like age or race. It assumes the system or logs can generate these specific rejection activities based on applicant data.

2.  **`response("CheckApplicantRace", "BiasMitigationCheck")` and `response("CheckApplicantAge", "BiasMitigationCheck")`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Mandates that if an activity checking a sensitive attribute like race (`CheckApplicantRace`) or age (`CheckApplicantAge`) occurs, then a dedicated `BiasMitigationCheck` activity must occur at some point later in the same trace.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** This ensures that whenever sensitive information is explicitly accessed, a procedural step aimed at ensuring fairness is triggered, preventing the sensitive data from being used inappropriately without oversight.

3.  **`precedence("BiasMitigationCheck", "FinalDecision")`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Requires that if a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity occurs, it must happen *before* the `FinalDecision` activity.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** This ensures that the fairness check is completed prior to the final outcome, allowing it to potentially influence or validate the decision rather than being an afterthought. Combined with the `response` constraint above, it helps ensure sensitive data checks trigger a *timely* bias check.

4.  **`nonsuccession("CheckApplicantRace", "Reject")` and `nonsuccession("CheckApplicantAge", "Reject")`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Prohibits the direct, immediate succession of checking a sensitive attribute (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantAge`) followed by a `Reject` decision.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** This constraint prevents a scenario where accessing sensitive information immediately leads to a rejection without any intermediate steps (like analysis, review, or the mandated `BiasMitigationCheck`). It forces a "pause" or intervening activity, reducing the appearance and potential reality of a direct causal link between viewing sensitive data and making a negative decision.
