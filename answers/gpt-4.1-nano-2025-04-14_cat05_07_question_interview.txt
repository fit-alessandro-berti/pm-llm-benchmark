Certainly! Here is a list of targeted, open-ended questions you could ask the interviewee to deepen your understanding of their property onboarding process:

2. **Property Details Recording:**
   - Can you walk me through the process of how property details are recorded and validated in your central database? Are there quality checks before final entry?

3. **Manager Assignment Criteria:**
   - What specific factors are prioritized when selecting a property manager for a new onboarding? Are there particular weighting or decision rules for workload, experience, or specialized properties?

4. **Manager-Landlord Communication:**
   - How is the initial expectations alignment conducted? Are there standardized agendas or scripts for these meetings, especially when handling properties with unique requirements?

5. **Scheduling Inspections and Photo Shoots:**
   - How do you coordinate the scheduling of inspections and photography visits? Are these conducted simultaneously or sequentially? How are delays or rescheduling handled?

6. **Handling Inspection Issues:**
   - What types of property issues typically arise from inspections, and how flexible is your process for coordinating repairs or improvements before listing?

7. **Marketing and Pricing:**
   - How do your marketing and pricing teams collaborate to ensure property listings reflect current market conditions? Is there a feedback loop from the market data back to pricing adjustments?

8. **Activation & Listing Process:**
   - Once a property is activated in the portal, how long does it typically take before tenants can view and apply? Are there steps to optimize or expedite this transition?

10. **Lease Finalization & Move-in Planning:**
    - How are lease negotiations handled, especially if multiple tenants are interested? How are special conditions or requirements from landlords incorporated into the lease?

11. **Handling Exceptions & Special Cases:**
    - Can you provide examples of common exceptions you encounter, such as properties needing special insurance or landlords requesting custom clauses? How are these managed within the process?

12. **Internal and External Stakeholder Communication:**
    - What are the primary communication channels used throughout onboarding? How do you ensure that all stakeholders stay informed and aligned during each phase?

13. **Timing and Sequencing:**
    - Are there typical timeframes for each step in the process? How do you handle bottlenecks or delays that might extend the overall onboarding timeline?

14. **Quality Checks and Internal Audits:**
    - How frequently and at what stages do quality checks or audits occur? Who is responsible, and what actions are taken if discrepancies or issues are identified?

15. **Process Improvement and Feedback:**
