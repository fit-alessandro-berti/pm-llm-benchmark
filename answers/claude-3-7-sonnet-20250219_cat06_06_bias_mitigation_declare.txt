# Updated DECLARE Model to Mitigate Bias in Loan Application Process

I've enhanced the original DECLARE model by adding constraints that limit potential bias when reviewing loan applications. Specifically, I've introduced constraints to ensure that sensitive attributes don't directly influence decisions without proper checks.

## Updated Model:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # Added
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Added
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Added
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Added
    },
    "precedence": {
        "ManualReview": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Added
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Added
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

## Explanation of Bias Mitigation Strategies:

1. **Mandatory Fairness-Promoting Activities**:
   Added `existence` constraints for `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` to ensure these fairness checks are always part of the process.

2. **Coexistence of Demographic Checks with Manual Reviews**:
   When sensitive attributes (age, gender, race) are checked, a manual review must also occur. This prevents relying solely on automated decisions for applicants from potentially disadvantaged groups.

3. **Response from Demographic Checks to Bias Mitigation**:
   After checking any sensitive attribute, a bias mitigation check must follow. This ensures that potential biases are explicitly addressed before proceeding.

4. **Precedence Requirements Before Decision-Making**:
   Both `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur before reaching the `FinalDecision`. This ensures that all applications receive proper fairness assessments.

5. **Prevention of Direct Discrimination**:
   Added `nonsuccession` constraints preventing demographic checks from directly leading to final decisions. This eliminates the possibility of making immediate decisions based solely on sensitive attributes.

These constraints collectively form a robust bias mitigation framework, ensuring that decisions are not unduly influenced by sensitive demographic attributes and that proper checks are in place throughout the loan application review process.
