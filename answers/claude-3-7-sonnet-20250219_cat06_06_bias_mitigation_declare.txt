# Updated DECLARE Model with Bias-Mitigating Constraints

Here's the updated `declare_model` with constraints designed to mitigate bias in the loan application process:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},

        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},

## Explanation of Bias-Mitigating Constraints

1. **Existence Constraints**:
   - Added `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` as required activities in every process instance, ensuring that bias mitigation steps are always performed.

2. **Responded Existence Constraints**:
   - When sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantAge`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantRace`) are checked, a `ManualReview` must occur at some point in the process, ensuring additional scrutiny for applications where sensitive attributes are considered.

3. **Coexistence Constraints**:
   - Added coexistence between sensitive attribute checks and `BiasMitigationCheck`, ensuring that whenever sensitive attributes are examined, bias mitigation procedures must also be present in the process.

4. **Response Constraints**:
   - Added response constraints requiring that after any sensitive attribute check, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must eventually follow, ensuring that bias mitigation is performed after examining potentially discriminatory factors.

5. **Precedence Constraints**:
   - Added precedence constraints requiring that both `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` must occur before a `FinalDecision`, ensuring that proper checks are performed before making decisions.

6. **Non-succession and Non-chain-succession Constraints**:
   - Added constraints preventing sensitive attribute checks from directly leading to a `FinalDecision`, requiring intermediate steps to prevent snap judgments based on protected characteristics.

These constraints collectively ensure that:
- Sensitive attribute checks always trigger bias mitigation procedures
- Manual reviews are required when sensitive attributes are considered
- Final decisions cannot be made immediately after examining sensitive attributes
- Proper bias mitigation checks must precede any final decision

This approach creates a process that systematically prevents direct discrimination by requiring additional verification steps whenever sensitive attributes are involved in the loan application process, while maintaining the original workflow structure.
