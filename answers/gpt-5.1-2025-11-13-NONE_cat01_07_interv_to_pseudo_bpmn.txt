Below is a structured, BPMN-like textual model of the “Invoice Approval Process” derived from the interviews. It’s organized by pools/lanes, activities, flows, gateways, and exceptions so it can be translated into a diagram with minimal ambiguity.

---

## 1. Participants (Pools / Lanes)

- **Pool: Organization**

  - **Lane: Supplier**
  - **Lane: Accounts Payable (AP) – Clerk (Mary)**
  - **Lane: Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
  - **Lane: Purchasing (Dan)**
  - **Lane: Department Manager (Carlos)**
  - **Lane: Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**
  - **Lane: Accounting System (System)**

---

## 2. Main Process Flow (Happy Path with PO, No Issues)

### 2.1 Start and Invoice Receipt

1. **Start Event:**  
   - Name: `Invoice received from supplier`

2. **Activity (Supplier Lane):**  
   - `Send invoice to AP (usually by email)`

3. **Activity (AP Clerk Lane):**  
   - `Receive invoice (email or other channel)`  
   - Input: `Invoice document`

---

### 2.2 Check for Purchase Order

4. **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
   - `Check invoice for valid PO number`

5. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `PO number present?`  
   - Condition [Yes]: Path A – Invoice has PO  
   - Condition [No]: Path B – Invoice missing PO

---

### Path A – Invoice has PO (Standard PO-based flow)

6. **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
   - `Log invoice into accounting system`  
   - System interaction: `System: Create invoice record`

7. **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
   - `Forward invoice to Purchasing for receipt confirmation`  
   - Output: `Invoice + PO reference` sent to Purchasing

8. **Activity (Purchasing):**  
   - `Open PO and compare with invoice (quantities, prices, delivery charges)`  
   - Inputs: `Invoice`, `PO`

9. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Invoice details correct against PO?`  
   - Condition [Yes]: proceed to confirmation  
   - Condition [No]: discrepancy flow (see section 3.1)

10. **Activity (Purchasing, if correct):**  
    - `Send confirmation email to AP (goods/services received and details correct)`

11. **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
    - `Match invoice line items to PO in system (3-way check: invoice, PO, receipt confirmation if available)`  
    - System interaction: `System: Record matching status`

12. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Invoice matches PO?`  
    - Condition [Yes]: proceed to manager approval  
    - Condition [No]: discrepancy flow (see section 3.1 – can be routed via AP Clerk/Purchasing/Supplier Relationship Manager/Supervisor)

13. **Activity (System Lane - automatic):**  
    - `Trigger manager approval request`  
    - Output: `Automatic email/notification to Department Manager with invoice, PO, and confirmation details`

14. **Activity (Department Manager):**  
    - `Review invoice, PO, and confirmation in system`

15. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Manager decision`  
    - Condition [Approve]: continue to payment scheduling  
    - Condition [Reject or Hold]: exception flow (see section 3.3)

16. **Activity (Department Manager, if Approve):**  
    - `Approve invoice in system`  
    - System interaction: `System: Record managerial approval`

17. **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
    - `Schedule invoice for payment`  
    - Input: `Approved invoice record`  
    - System interaction: `System: Add invoice to next payment run`

18. **End Event:**  
    - Name: `Invoice scheduled for payment`

---

### Path B – Invoice missing PO

19. **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
    - `Send invoice back to supplier requesting PO number / more details`  
    - Output: `Email to supplier requesting PO or clarification`

20. **Intermediate Event (Supplier Lane):**  
    - `Supplier provides missing PO or sends revised invoice`

21. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Valid PO obtained?`  
    - Condition [Yes]:  
      - **Activity (AP Clerk):** `Log invoice into accounting system`  then join with step 7 of Path A  
    - Condition [No / cannot obtain]:  
      - Go to exception handling for non-PO invoices (see section 3.2)

---

## 3. Exception and Variation Flows

### 3.1 Discrepancies Between Invoice and PO (Amounts, Prices, Units, etc.)

**Trigger points for this gateway:**

- At step 9 (Purchasing finds invoice does not match PO).  
- At step 12 (AP Clerk’s system-based matching finds mismatch).  

22. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Invoice-PO discrepancy detected?`  
   - Condition [Yes]: Discrepancy flow  
   - Condition [No]: Continue to standard flow (steps 13–18)

**Discrepancy Handling Activities:**

23. **Activity (Purchasing or AP Clerk – depending on who detects issue):**  
   - `Notify AP to hold invoice until issue resolved`  
   - Possible outputs: `Email to AP: hold invoice`, `Flag in system`

24. **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
   - `Place invoice on hold in system`  
   - System interaction: `System: Update status to "On Hold"`

25. **Activity (Purchasing AP / Purchasing / Supplier Relationship Manager):**  
   - If Purchasing detected error:  
     - `Contact supplier directly for corrected invoice`  
     - OR  
     - `Request AP Clerk to await corrected invoice from supplier`
   - If AP detected error:  
     - `Email Purchasing for clarification`  

26. **Parallel / Conditional Activities (Supplier Relationship Manager, if involved):**  
   - `Engage with supplier to resolve pricing/terms discrepancy`  
   - `Check supplier contract and determine correct price/terms`  
   - `Inform AP or Purchasing of correct terms`  
   - Output: `Clarified pricing/terms`, `Instruction to supplier or AP`

27. **Activity (AP Supervisor, when escalation needed):**  
   - `Investigate unresolved discrepancy`  
   - `Coordinate with Purchasing, Supplier Relationship Manager, Supplier, and possibly department heads`  
   - Possible outcomes:  
     - Decide to accept corrected invoice  
     - Decide to reject invoice  
     - Decide to create/adjust PO or contract terms

28. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Discrepancy resolved?`  
   - Condition [Yes]:  
     - **Activity (Supplier or AP, depending on resolution):**  
       - `Supplier sends corrected invoice` OR `AP updates invoice/PO details in system as per agreed resolution`  
     - **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
       - `Update invoice record and re-match to PO in system`  
     - Flow rejoins standard path at step 11 or 12 (matching, then manager approval).  
   - Condition [No]:  
     - Proceed to invoice rejection (step 36).

---

### 3.2 Non-PO or Informally Contracted Services

This covers invoices that have no associated PO and may not get one from the supplier, especially for informal service arrangements.

29. **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
   - `Escalate non-PO invoice to AP Supervisor`  
   - Output: `Email or system escalation with invoice details`

30. **Activity (AP Supervisor):**  
   - `Assess non-PO invoice`  
   - `Contact relevant department head(s)`  
   - `Determine whether retrospective PO should be created or invoice should be rejected`

31. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Decision on retrospective PO`  
   - Condition [Create retrospective PO]:  
     - **Activity (AP Supervisor + Department Head / Purchasing):**  
       - `Create retrospective PO or obtain formal PO reference`  
     - **Activity (AP Clerk):**  
       - `Log invoice with retrospective PO into accounting system (if not already logged)`  
     - Flow continues to step 7 (Purchasing confirmation)  standard path.  
   - Condition [Reject invoice]:  
     - Go to step 36 (invoice rejection).

---

### 3.3 Manager Rejects or Requests Investigation

32. **Activity (Department Manager):**  
   - If suspicious or unexpected items are found:  
     - `Reject invoice` OR `Request AP to hold and investigate further`

33. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** `Manager action type`  
   - Condition [Reject]: go to step 36 (invoice rejection)  
   - Condition [Hold for investigation]:  
     - **Activity (AP Clerk):** `Place invoice on hold and investigate`  
       - May involve:  
         - `Contact AP Supervisor` (step 29)  
         - `Contact Purchasing for clarification` (steps 23–27)  
         - `Contact Supplier Relationship Manager for supplier clarification` (step 26)  
     - After investigation, go to discrepancy resolution gateway (step 28).  
       - If resolved positively: return to manager for reapproval (steps 14–17).  
       - If not: invoice rejection (step 36).

---

### 3.4 Invoice Rejected

34. **Activity (AP Clerk or AP Supervisor, depending on who holds authority for rejections in practice – not fully clear):**  
   - `Mark invoice as rejected in the accounting system`  
   - System interaction: `System: Set status = Rejected`

35. **Activity (AP Clerk or Supervisor):**  
   - `Notify supplier and/or internal stakeholders of rejection decision`  
   - Output: `Email to supplier and relevant internal parties`

36. **End Event:**  
   - Name: `Invoice rejected (no payment)`

---

## 4. Data Objects / Artifacts

- **Invoice** (from Supplier)
- **Purchase Order (PO)** (from Purchasing/Department)
- **Confirmation of receipt** (email or system note from Purchasing)
- **Contract / Agreement** (referenced by Supplier Relationship Manager)
- **Retrospective PO** (created by AP Supervisor/Department Head/Purchasing)
- **Invoice record in accounting system** (system object with statuses: logged, on hold, matched, approved, rejected, scheduled for payment)

---

## 5. Noted Ambiguities / Assumptions

- Who technically “presses reject” in the system is not fully specified; modeled as AP Clerk/Supervisor based on typical practice.
- The exact system name and whether it supports 3-way match (PO, invoice, goods receipt) is implied but not fully explicit; modeled abstractly as `Accounting System`.
- Routing for non-PO invoices after retrospective PO creation is assumed to follow the same standard path (Purchasing confirmation  Manager approval  Payment scheduling).
- Whether Purchasing always confirms physical receipt or only compares financial details is not fully clear; modeled as confirmation of both receipt and correctness.
