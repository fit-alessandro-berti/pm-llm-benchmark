Here is a **BPMN-like textual process model** derived from the interview transcripts, structured to capture the **activities, sequence flow, gateways, roles, artifacts, and exceptions** described by the stakeholders.

---

### **Process Name: Invoice Approval Workflow**
**Scope:** End-to-end process for validating, approving, and scheduling supplier invoices for payment.

---

### **Participants/Roles:**
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** – Initial receipt, logging, PO validation, discrepancy handling, payment scheduling.
2. **Purchasing Officer (Dan)** – PO/invoice matching, receipt confirmation, discrepancy resolution.
3. **Department Manager (Carlos)** – Final approval/rejection of invoices.
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)** – Escalation point for unresolved discrepancies, retrospective PO creation.
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** – Supplier liaison for missing/incorrect invoice data.
6. **System (Accounting/ERP)** – Automated notifications, document storage, approval routing.

---

### **Artifacts/Data Objects:**
- **Invoice** (input) – Received via email.
- **Purchase Order (PO)** – Referenced for validation.
- **Receipt Confirmation** – Proof of goods/services delivery (from Purchasing).
- **Discrepancy Report** – Documented issues (e.g., pricing, quantities).
- **Approval/Rejection Notification** – System-generated emails.
- **Payment Schedule** – Output for finance team.

### **Process Flow:**

#### **1. Invoice Receipt & Initial Validation**
- **Activity:** *Receive Invoice*
  - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk
  - **Input:** Invoice (email attachment).
  - **Decision Gateway (G1):** *Is there a valid PO number?*
    - **Yes**  Proceed to *Log Invoice*.
    - **No**  *Request PO from Supplier* (email to supplier via Supplier Relationship Manager if needed).
      - **Sub-Process:** Supplier provides PO  Restart at *Log Invoice*.
      - **Exception:** If no PO can be obtained  Escalate to **Supervisor (Rita)** for retrospective PO or rejection.

- **Activity:** *Log Invoice*
  - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk
  - **Action:** Enter invoice details into the accounting system.
  - **Output:** Logged invoice record.

#### **2. Purchase Order & Receipt Validation**
- **Activity:** *Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation*
  - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  Purchasing Officer
  - **Input:** Logged invoice + PO reference.
  - **Action:** Email to Purchasing with invoice/PO for verification.

- **Activity:** *Validate Invoice Against PO & Receipt*
  - **Role:** Purchasing Officer
  - **Decision Gateway (G2):** *Does the invoice match the PO and receipt?*
    - **Yes**  *Confirm Receipt* (email to Accounts Payable).
    - **No**  *Identify Discrepancy* (e.g., price, quantity, missing items).
      - **Sub-Process:**
        - **Minor Issue:** Purchasing contacts supplier directly or requests clarification from Accounts Payable.
        - **Major Issue:** Escalate to **Supervisor (Rita)** or **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**.
          - **Resolution Paths:**
            - Supplier corrects invoice  Restart at *Log Invoice*.
            - Retrospective PO created  Proceed to *Match Invoice*.
            - Invoice rejected  *Notify Supplier* (via Karen).

#### **3. Invoice Matching & Manager Approval**
- **Activity:** *Match Invoice to PO*
  - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk
  - **Input:** Confirmed receipt + PO data.
  - **Decision Gateway (G3):** *Are all line items matched?*
    - **Yes**  Trigger *Manager Approval*.
    - **No**  Re-escalate to Purchasing/Supervisor (loop back to G2).

- **Activity:** *Request Manager Approval*
  - **Role:** System (automated email to Department Manager).
  - **Input:** Matched invoice + PO + receipt confirmation.
  - **Decision Gateway (G4):** *Manager’s Decision*
    - **Approve**  Proceed to *Schedule Payment*.
    - **Reject**  *Investigate Further* (loop to Accounts Payable Clerk/Supervisor).
      - **Exception:** If rejection is due to budget concerns  May require finance team review (not detailed in interviews).

#### **4. Payment Scheduling**
- **Activity:** *Schedule for Payment*
  - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk
  - **Action:** Add approved invoice to payment run queue.
  - **Output:** Payment scheduled (sent to finance for execution).

### **Key Gateways & Decision Points:**
| **Gateway** | **Condition**                          | **Outcomes**                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| G1          | Valid PO number?                       | Yes  Log Invoice; No  Request PO or Escalate.                              |
| G2          | Invoice matches PO & receipt?          | Yes  Confirm; No  Resolve discrepancy (supplier/Purchasing/Supervisor).   |
| G3          | All line items matched?                | Yes  Manager Approval; No  Re-escalate.                                    |
| G4          | Manager approves?                     | Yes  Schedule Payment; No  Investigate.                                   |

### **Exceptions & Variations:**
1. **Missing PO:**
   - **Path:** Invoice  Request PO  (Supplier provides PO)  Log Invoice.
   - **Alternative:** Supervisor creates retrospective PO or rejects invoice.

2. **Discrepancies:**
   - **Pricing/Quantity Mismatch:** Purchasing contacts supplier or escalates to Supervisor/Karen.
   - **Unresolved Issues:** Invoice held until corrected or rejected.

3. **Manager Rejection:**
   - Rare (~1/2 months); triggers investigation by Accounts Payable or Supervisor.

4. **Informal Services:**
   - No PO exists  Supervisor coordinates with department heads for approval/rejection.

---
### **Notes on Ambiguities:**
- **System Automation:** Interviews imply some steps (e.g., manager approval notifications) are automated, but the exact system workflow is unclear.
- **Supplier Communication:** Karen’s involvement varies—sometimes looped in by Purchasing, other times by Accounts Payable.
- **Retrospective PO Process:** Not fully detailed; assumed to involve Supervisor + department head collaboration.
- **Payment Execution:** Final payment step (post-scheduling) is out of scope per interviews.

---
### **Visualization Guidance:**
- Use **parallel gateways** if Purchasing and Accounts Payable perform validations concurrently (not explicitly stated).
- **Escalation paths** (to Rita/Karen) should be modeled as **exception flows** off the main path.
- **Email notifications** can be represented as **message flows** between roles.

This model balances the **consensus view** from interviews while flagging areas where further clarification may be needed (e.g., system automation rules).
