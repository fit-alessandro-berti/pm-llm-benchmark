1. Cases with significantly longer duration (Submit  Close)
- **Case 2001 (A, Low):** 2024-04-01 09:00  10:30 (1.5 hours)  
- **Case 2004 (B, Low):** 2024-04-01 09:20  10:45 (1.5 hours)  
- **Case 2002 (B, Medium):** 2024-04-01 09:05  2024-04-02 11:00 (1 day, 2 hours)  
- **Case 2003 (A, High):** 2024-04-01 09:10  2024-04-03 09:30 (2 days, 0.5 hours)  
- **Case 2005 (B, High):** 2024-04-01 09:25  2024-04-04 14:30 (3 days, 5 hours)

**Performance issues:**  
- **Clearly problematic:** 2003 and 2005 (multiday durations, especially 2005).  
- **Moderately long:** 2002 (just over 1 day).  
- **Baseline / “fast”:** 2001, 2004 (same-day, ~1.5 hours)  can be treated as reference.

2. Attribute-based root cause analysis

### a) Complexity vs. duration

Pattern across cases:
- **Low complexity (2001, 2004):**
  - No “Request Additional Documents”
  - End-to-end 1.5 hours
- **Medium complexity (2002):**
  - 1 “Request Additional Documents”
  - End-to-end 1 day
- **High complexity (2003, 2005):**
  - Multiple “Request Additional Documents”
  - 2003: 2 requests  2 days  
  - 2005: 3 requests  3+ days

**Inference:**  
- Higher complexity  more “Request Additional Documents” events and longer waiting times between them  significantly longer case durations.
- Complexity is a **strong, direct driver** of extended lead times.

### b) Region vs. duration

Compare similar complexity across regions:

- **Low complexity:**  
  - 2001 (Region A): 1.5 hours  
  - 2004 (Region B): 1.5 hours  
   For low complexity, **Region A vs. B shows no performance difference.**

- **High complexity:**  
  - 2003 (Region A): 2 doc requests, 2 days  
  - 2005 (Region B): 3 doc requests, 3+ days  
   Region B’s high-complexity case is longer, but it also has **more doc requests**, so complexity dynamics (or how it’s handled) matter more than region alone.

- **Medium complexity (Region B only):**  
  - 2002 (Region B): 1 day, 1 doc request  
   No medium case in Region A to compare.

**Inference:**  
- The **regions behave similarly** on low-complexity work.  
- Longer durations in Region B (case 2005) are tightly tied to the **number of document requests**, not simply to being in Region B.
- Region might still be a *contributing* factor if, for example, Region B has slower customer response or more conservative document policies, but the primary signal here is complexity and rework rather than a systematic A vs. B difference.

### c) Resource vs. duration

Focus on key roles:

#### Claim adjusters
- **Adjuster_Mike (Region A):**
  - 2001 (Low): fast, no doc requests.
  - 2003 (High): 2 doc requests (11:00, 17:00 same day)  case still runs to day 3 (approval next day 16:00, payment morning of day 3).
- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B):**
  - 2002 (Medium): 1 doc request  case 1 day.
  - 2004 (Low): fast, no doc requests.
  - 2005 (High): 3 doc requests spread over several days (2024-04-01 11:30, 2024-04-02 17:00, 2024-04-03 15:00)  case 3+ days.

Patterns:
- When **no doc request** is needed, both adjusters process quickly (2001, 2004).
- When **complex/high**:
  - Cases handled by both adjusters require multiple document requests.
  - The most problematic case (2005) is with **Adjuster_Lisa**, with 3 separate requests on consecutive days  indicates rework or insufficient completeness of earlier requests.

**Inference:**  
- **Adjusters are the key bottleneck point** where complexity manifests:
  - repeated “Request Additional Documents”
  - long calendar waits between requests and eventual approval.
- No evidence that one adjuster is intrinsically slower on comparable cases; rather:
  - **Lisa’s high-complexity case (2005)** shows more fragmentation in the data collection: likely poor first-time-right quality of the document request or stricter documentation expectations.

#### Managers
- **Manager_Ann:**
  - Approves low (2001, 2004) and medium (2002) cases quickly once previous steps are done.
- **Manager_Bill:**
  - Approves high-complexity cases:
    - 2003: approves on 2024-04-02 16:00 after last doc request 2024-04-01 17:00.
    - 2005: approves on 2024-04-04 10:00 after last doc request 2024-04-03 15:00.
  - His approvals are **same or next day** after the last document request.

**Inference:**  
- Manager approval does not look like the main bottleneck; delays are mostly **before** approval, while documents are being collected.

#### Finance and CSR
- Finance (Alan/Carl) and CSRs (Jane/Mary/Paul) execute payment and closure **within minutes** of the previous step in all cases.  
- They do **not** appear to be a source of delay.

3. Root causes and mitigation suggestions

### Root cause 1: High complexity  repeated document requests and long waiting times

Evidence:
- Only high-complexity cases (2003, 2005) have multiple “Request Additional Documents.”
- Number of document requests strongly correlates with total lead time:
  - 0 requests  ~1.5 hours
  - 1 request  ~1 day
  - 2–3 requests  2–3+ days
- In case 2005, the same adjuster (Lisa) issues three separate requests on three different days, indicating incremental discovery of missing information.

Possible explanations:
- For high-complexity claims:
  - The **initial evaluation does not capture all needed information**, leading to repeated clarifications.
  - There is **no standardized checklist** for complex cases, so adjusters discover missing documents piecemeal.
  - Claimants take time to respond or provide incomplete information, causing additional cycles.

Mitigations:
1. **Introduce structured intake/checklists for high-complexity claims**
   - Standard document checklist per claim type and complexity.
   - System-enforced prompts that guide adjusters through all required information in one go.
2. **First-time-right KPI for document requests**
   - Monitor how often a case needs more than one “Request Additional Documents.”
   - Provide feedback and training to adjusters with higher rework rates, focusing on complex cases.
3. **Customer guidance and digital upload tools**
   - Provide clear instructions and online portals for document submission, with progress indicators (e.g., “3/5 required documents received”).
   - Pre-validate uploaded documents (format, completeness) to minimize follow-up.

### Root cause 2: Adjuster handling practices on complex cases (especially rework for some resources)

Evidence:
- All adjusters handle low-complexity cases quickly.
- High-complexity:
  - Mike: 2 doc requests (same day)  2-day case.
  - Lisa: 3 doc requests spread across 3 days  3+ day case.
- The spread of Lisa’s requests suggests:
  - Possibly **piecemeal reviews** instead of doing a comprehensive analysis before contacting the customer.
  - Or **more conservative risk posture** (asking for extra documents as new doubts arise).

Mitigations:
1. **Complex-case review protocol for adjusters**
   - Before sending any document request, adjusters must:
     - Perform a full review of the case.
     - List all foreseeable documents needed.
   - Require internal peer review for very complex claims before the first request goes to the customer.
2. **Training and best-practice sharing**
   - Compare high-complexity cases across adjusters:
     - Identify who consistently resolves in fewer requests.
     - Use their approach to train others (e.g., draft templates for document requests).
3. **System support for bundling requests**
   - Workflow rule: discourage multiple document requests within a short time window for the same claim.
   - System “warning” if a second request is being created within, say, 48 hours, prompting a re-check for completeness.

---

### Root cause 3: Complexity and region interplay (Region B high-complexity case 2005)

Evidence:
- Low-complexity performance is consistent across regions.
- The worst case (2005) is Region B, high complexity, with repeated doc requests.
- Medium-complexity Region B case (2002) is slower than low-complexity but still reasonable (~1 day).

Possible explanations:
- Region B may:
  - Handle more complex products or policies requiring extra scrutiny.
  - Serve customers who are slower to respond or have more fragmented documentation.
  - Have different compliance/regulatory requirements driving more detailed documentation.

Mitigations:
1. **Region-specific monitoring of complex cases**
   - Track number of document requests and average time per step by region and complexity.
   - If Region B keeps showing more iterations on high-complexity cases, investigate local procedures or regulatory drivers.
2. **Standardize complex-claim handling across regions**
   - Align policies so Region A and B use the same decision rules, checklists, and templates.
   - If regulation differs, encode region-specific but clear documentation packages to avoid ad-hoc decisions.

### Root cause 4: Waiting time between last document request and approval

Evidence:
- Case 2003:
  - Last request: 2024-04-01 17:00, approval: 2024-04-02 16:00  nearly 1 day.
- Case 2005:
  - Last request: 2024-04-03 15:00, approval: 2024-04-04 10:00  ~19 hours.
- Even after documents are “finalized,” approval is not immediate for complex cases.

Possible explanations:
- Managers may batch approvals for complex cases or handle them at fixed times.
- Additional internal checks for high-value or high-risk claims.

Mitigations:
1. **SLA and prioritization for post-document approval**
   - Define service levels: once all documents are in, high-complexity claims should be approved within X hours.
   - Prioritize “ready for approval” cases in the manager’s worklist, especially for high complexity.
2. **Automation of pre-approval checks**
   - Use rules or decision support tools to pre-check completeness and policy adherence.
   - Leave only truly judgmental aspects to managers, reducing time per case and enabling more frequent approvals.

---

Summary:

- **Cases with performance issues:** 2003 and especially 2005, with 2002 as a moderate outlier.
- **Main drivers of long duration:**
  - **High complexity**, strongly associated with:
    - Multiple “Request Additional Documents” events.
    - Long calendar waits between requests and between final request and approval.
  - **Adjuster practices** (especially on complex cases) that lead to fragmented, repeated document requests.
- **Region and specific resources** appear secondary to complexity, but Region B’s worst case (2005) and Adjuster_Lisa’s pattern suggest local practices could magnify complexity-related delays.

Implementing structured checklists, better first-time-right document requests, clearer customer guidance, and tighter SLAs around complex-case approvals would directly target the observed performance issues.
