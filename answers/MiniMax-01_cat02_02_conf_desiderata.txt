### **Analysis of the Event Log**

#### **1. Identification of Normative Rule Violations**

**Case 1:**
- **Analysis:**  
  - The sequence of activities is as follows:  
    1. Application Received (2024-01-10 09:00)  
    2. Credit Check (2024-01-10 09:30)  
    3. Risk Assessment (2024-01-10 10:00)  
    4. Loan Decision (Approved) (2024-01-10 11:00)  
    5. Inform Applicant (2024-01-10 13:00)  
    6. Finalize Documentation (2024-01-10 13:30)  
    7. Close Case (2024-01-10 14:00)  
  - **Conclusion:** All normative rules are followed. The sequence is correct, and actions are performed in the appropriate order.

**Case 2:**
- **Analysis:**  
  - The sequence of activities is as follows:  
    1. Application Received (2024-01-11 08:00)  
    2. **Risk Assessment (2024-01-11 08:20)**  
    3. Credit Check (2024-01-11 08:20)  
    4. Loan Decision (Rejected) (2024-01-11 09:30)  
    5. **Finalize Documentation (2024-01-11 10:00)**  
    6. Close Case (2024-01-11 10:30)  
  - **Violations:**  
    1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** This is a clear violation of the normative rule that requires Credit Check to occur before Risk Assessment.  
    2. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** This is a violation because documentation should not be finalized after a loan is rejected.  
  - **Conclusion:** Case 2 violates two normative rules.

---

**Case 3:**
- **Analysis:**  
  - The sequence of activities is as follows:  
    1. Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00)  
    2. Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00)  
    3. Risk Assessment (2024-01-14 11:00)  
    4. Loan Decision (Approved) (2024-01-14 12:00)  
    5. Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00)  
    6. Finalize Documentation (2024-01-17 09:00)  
    7. Close Case (2024-01-17 10:00)  
  - **Violations:**  
    - **No Follow-up Call:** While not a normative rule violation, this is a missed desideratum.  
  - **Conclusion:** Case 3 does not violate any normative rules but fails to meet some desiderata.

---

#### **2. Identification of Desiderata Failures**

**Case 1:**
- **Desiderata Analysis:**  
  - **Credit Check Timing:** The Credit Check was completed within 30 minutes of receiving the application, which is well within the recommended 24-hour window.  
  - **Applicant Information Timing:** The applicant was informed within 2 hours of the loan decision, which is within the recommended 48-hour window.  
  - **Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call was made.  
  - **Conclusion:** While the follow-up call was not performed, this is a desideratum failure, not a normative violation.

---

**Case 2:**
- **Desiderata Analysis:**  
  - **Credit Check Timing:** The Credit Check was completed 20 minutes after the Risk Assessment, which is after the normative requirement (Credit Check should occur first). This is a normative violation, not a desideratum failure.  
  - **Applicant Information Timing:** Not applicable because the loan was rejected.  
  - **Follow-up Call:** Not applicable because the case was closed without approval.  
  - **Conclusion:** The primary issue is the normative violation, not desiderata failures.

---

**Case 3:**
- **Desiderata Analysis:**  
  - **Credit Check Timing:** The Credit Check was completed more than 48 hours after the application was received, which violates the recommended 24-hour window.  
  - **Applicant Information Timing:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision, which violates the recommended 48-hour window.  
  - **Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call was made.  
  - **Conclusion:** Case 3 fails to meet several desiderata:  
    - Credit Check was not completed promptly.  
    - Applicant was not informed promptly.  
    - No follow-up call was made.

---

#### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**

**Case 2 Violations:**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**  
  - **Possible Interpretation:** The Risk Assessment may have been initiated based on preliminary information available at the time of application, without realizing that a Credit Check was required first.  
  - **Justification:** This is a procedural error that could be mitigated by better training or a more robust workflow system that enforces the correct sequence.

- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**  
  - **Possible Interpretation:** The Finalize Documentation activity may have been triggered automatically after the loan decision, without considering the outcome.  
  - **Justification:** This is a system design flaw that should be addressed to prevent such errors. The system should be updated to prevent documentation finalization after a rejection.

**Case 3 Desiderata Failures:**
- **Credit Check and Applicant Information Timing:**  
  - **Possible Interpretation:** The delays may have been due to resource constraints or unforeseen circumstances (e.g., staff shortages, system issues).  
  - **Justification:** While these delays are not ideal, they may be understandable given certain constraints. However, improving resource allocation and system efficiency could help meet the desiderata.

- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  - **Possible Interpretation:** The follow-up call may have been overlooked or deemed unnecessary.  
  - **Justification:** This is a missed opportunity to ensure alignment and satisfaction. Implementing a checklist or reminder system could help ensure follow-up calls are not forgotten.

   - Procedural errors and system design flaws may contribute to normative violations.  
   - Resource constraints and oversight may lead to desiderata failures.  
   - Implementing better training, system updates, and reminder systems could address these issues.

### **Recommendations**

- **For Normative Violations (Case 2):**  
  - Review and update the workflow system to enforce the correct sequence of activities.  
  - Implement validation checks to prevent actions like finalizing documentation after a rejection.

- **For Desiderata Failures (Cases 1 and 3):**  
  - Set up reminders for timely Credit Checks and applicant notifications.  
  - Implement a follow-up call checklist or reminder system.  
  - Allocate resources effectively to ensure timely processing.

- **General Recommendations:**  
  - Conduct regular training sessions to reinforce procedural adherence.  
  - Monitor the process closely to identify and address issues promptly.  
  - Consider automating parts of the process to reduce human error.
