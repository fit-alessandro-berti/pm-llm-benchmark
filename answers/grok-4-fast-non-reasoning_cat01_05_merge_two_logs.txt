### Merged Event Log

Below is the integrated event log, merging events from Log A (System A) and Log B (System B) for Order#1234. I used Log A's timestamps as the primary timeline where possible for chronological sorting, as it is designated as the "primary" log. For merged events, I selected the Log A timestamp as primary unless Log B's was clearly earlier and within tolerance (e.g., for the initial order receipt). Events are sorted chronologically by this primary timestamp.

The output format for each event is:
- **Primary Timestamp**: Chosen timestamp (with source noted if merged).
- **Event Type**: Unified name (harmonizing variations from both logs, e.g., "Order Received" for "OrderReceived").
- **Attributes**: All available fields from both logs, prefixed with source (A or B) for clarity. Merged fields (e.g., order_id) are shown once.
- **Origin**: Indicates if merged (A+B) or single-source (A-only or B-only).

```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z (from B, selected as earlier), Order Received, order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u45 (B), resource_id: r10 (B), notes: "Event captured at warehouse system" (B)
2023-10-10T10:01:29Z (from B, selected as earlier), Order Validated, order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u12 (B), resource_id: r10 (B), notes: "Cross-check inventory" (B)
2023-10-10T10:02:00Z (from A), Payment Processed, order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u12 (B), resource_id: r99 (B), notes: "Payment gateway delay" (B)
2023-10-10T10:03:00Z (from B), Quality Check, order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u45 (B), resource_id: r11 (B), notes: "Random inspection" (B)
2023-10-10T10:05:00Z (from A), Item Shipped, order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u45 (B), resource_id: r10 (B), notes: "Package handed to courier" (B)
2023-10-10T10:20:00Z (from A), Item Delivered, order_id: Order#1234
```

### Reasoning for Matching, Merging, and Resolutions

#### Overall Approach
- **Matching Criteria**: Events were matched based on shared `order_id` (Order#1234 in all cases) and timestamp proximity (tolerance of <2 seconds for considering them the "same" event). I also considered semantic similarity in event names/descriptions to infer if they represent the same activity (e.g., "Order Received" in A vs. "OrderReceived" in B). Since both logs cover the same order fulfillment process, I assumed events without close temporal or semantic matches were unique steps.
- **Merging Rules**: For matched events, I combined all unique attributes (e.g., appending user_id, resource_id, and notes from B to A's basic fields). No conflicting attributes existed (e.g., no duplicate fields with different values). Timestamps were not averaged; instead, I chose the one that best fit the primary timeline (Log A preferred, unless B's was earlier and within tolerance to avoid gaps).
- **Chronological Sorting**: Used primary timestamps for ordering. This resulted in a logical sequence: receipt  validation  payment  quality check  shipping  delivery.
- **Unmatched Events**: Included as-is with origin noted. No events were discarded.
- **Tolerance Handling**: All matches were within 2 seconds (or exactly aligned semantically). Larger gaps (e.g., >2 seconds) were treated as distinct events.
- **Naming Harmonization**: Standardized event names for clarity (e.g., "OrderValidation"  "Order Validated"; "PaymentCheck"  "Payment Processed"; "Shipping"  "Item Shipped"). This was based on contextual similarity without altering meaning.
- **Attribute Integration**: Log B's richer attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes) were always incorporated into matches. Log A had no extras beyond event_type and order_id, so nothing was lost.

#### Event-by-Event Decisions
1. **Order Received / OrderReceived** (Matched):
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z (2 seconds earlier)
   - Reasoning: Semantic match (both indicate order intake). Timestamps differ by 2 seconds (within tolerance), likely due to Log B's warehouse capture vs. Log A's receipt time. Selected B's timestamp as primary to reflect the actual start (avoids implying a 2-second delay). Merged attributes: Added B's user_id, resource_id, and notes. No conflicts.

2. **Order Validated / OrderValidation** (Matched):
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z (1 second earlier)
   - Reasoning: Clear semantic match (validation step). 1-second difference within tolerance; likely processing lag in Log A. Selected B's timestamp for precision. Merged attributes: Added B's user_id, resource_id, and notes (inventory check fits validation context).

3. **Payment Processed / PaymentCheck** (Matched):
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z (5 seconds later)
   - Reasoning: Semantic match (payment handling; "Check" in B aligns with processing). 5-second offset exceeds strict 2-second tolerance but is close enough given the context (B notes "gateway delay," explaining the slight lag). Preferred Log A's timestamp as primary to align with its timeline. Merged attributes: Added B's user_id, resource_id, and notes. If tolerance were stricter, this could be separate, but merging provides a cleaner log.

4. **Quality Check** (B-only, Unmatched):
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z
   - Reasoning: No corresponding event in Log A (next A event is at 10:05:00Z, 2+ minutes later). This appears to be an additional step captured only by B (e.g., warehouse-specific inspection). Included as-is with B's attributes. No merge possible.

5. **Item Shipped / Shipping** (Matched):
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
   - Log B: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z (2 seconds later)
   - Reasoning: Semantic match (shipping/handover to courier). 2-second difference within tolerance; B's notes confirm the activity. Selected Log A's timestamp as primary. Merged attributes: Added B's user_id, resource_id, and notes.

6. **Item Delivered** (A-only, Unmatched):
   - Log A: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z
   - Reasoning: No equivalent in Log B (Log B ends at shipping). This is a later fulfillment step likely tracked only by Log A (e.g., delivery confirmation). Included as-is with no additional attributes from B.

This merged log results in 6 events (4 merged, 2 single-source), providing a complete, enriched view without duplication or loss of data. If stricter matching rules were applied (e.g., exact 2-second tolerance excluding the payment event), it would split into 7 events, but the current approach minimizes fragmentation while respecting the logs' intent.
