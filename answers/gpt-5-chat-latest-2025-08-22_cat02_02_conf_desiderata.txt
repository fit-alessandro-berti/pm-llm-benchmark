Perfect — you’ve described a classic process compliance checking setting where we must distinguish **hard (normative) violations** from **soft (desideratum) deviations**. Let’s go case by case.


---

## **1. Normative Compliance (Strict Rules)**

 **Case 1**  
- **Sequence:** Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
- **Checks:** The order of activities is exactly correct, with no forbidden activity performed.  
- **Conclusion:** **Fully compliant with normative rules.**

 **Case 2**  
- **Violation 1 (Ordering):** Risk Assessment occurred at `08:20` before the Credit Check (`09:00`). This is not allowed: credit check must always precede risk assessment.  
- **Violation 2 (Contradictory action):** Loan was **Rejected** but **Finalize Documentation** was done (`10:00`). Documentation finalization is only allowed for **Approved** cases.  
- **Sequence problem:** The process deviated from the mandatory path.  
- **Conclusion:** **Case 2 contains multiple normative violations (strict non-conformance).**

 **Case 3**  
- **Sequence:** Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
- The strict ordering is respected.  
- **Conclusion:** **No normative violation.** (Only desirability issues, see below).

## **2. Desiderata Compliance (Soft Constraints)**

These are preferences, not strict rules.  

 **Case 1**  
- Credit Check was performed 30 minutes after application (well within the 24-hour preferred window).  
- Inform Applicant occurred 2 hours after decision (well within 48 hours).  
- Follow-up Call: not explicitly present, but it’s “encouraged, not required.”  
- **Conclusion:** Case 1 meets desiderata (no concerns).

 **Case 2**  
- Credit Check actually happened only 1 hour after application, which is fine.  
- Inform Applicant is missing altogether (instead they jumped to closing after documentation finalization). But since this is due to a **normative violation**, it’s not about desiderata anymore — the case is outright invalid.  
- **Conclusion:** Not meaningful to evaluate desiderata here because it already violates stricter rules.

 **Case 3**  
- **Credit Check delay:** Application received Jan 12, Credit Check only on Jan 14  more than 24 hours later  violates the *recommended timing*.  
- **Inform Applicant delay:** Decision on Jan 14, Applicant informed Jan 16  exceeds the 48-hour recommendation.  
- **Follow-up Call missing.** Not required, but would have been best practice.  
- **Conclusion:** Case 3 is normatively correct but **deviates from desiderata** (timeliness and missing optional call).

## **3. Interpretations & Justifications**

- **Case 1:** An ideal run: quick checks, prompt notification, proper closing. This is the **benchmark example**.  
- **Case 2:** Likely reflects procedural misunderstanding or incorrect logging. Perhaps the credit score was *informally known* but only officially logged later, or documentation was mistakenly finalized despite rejection (could reflect misclassification or a rep doing unnecessary work). Regardless, **strict violation**.  
- **Case 3:** Operational constraints could explain deviations:  
  - Credit check delay (resource unavailability, backlog).  
  - Informing applicant late (perhaps holidays, applicant unreachable).  
  - No follow-up call (time constraints, or considered redundant if documentation was already finalized).  
  These do not break compliance but make the process less efficient and less customer friendly.

## ** Final Summary**

- **Normative Violations (Strict):**  
  - **Case 2** (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after rejection).  
- **Desiderata Deviations (Soft):**  
  - **Case 3** (late Credit Check; late Informing of applicant; no follow-up call).  
- **Fully Compliant:**  
  - **Case 1.**

Would you like me to **translate these compliance findings into a set of formal declarative constraints (e.g., using LTL / Declare)** so that they can be automatically checked on any new event log?
