     - 320ms to "Send Order".
   - Transitions to:
     - "Process Return".
     - "Check Stock".
     - "Send Order".

3. **Create Order**:
   - Handles 3.5M objects.
   - Processing time: 300ms.
   - Transitions to "Pack Goods".

4. **Pack Goods**:
   - Handles 2.8M objects.
   - Processing time: 200ms.
   - Transitions to "Ship Goods".

5. **Ship Goods**:
   - Handles 1.8M objects.
   - Processing time: 200ms.
   - Transitions to "Confirm Delivery".

6. **Confirm Delivery**:

7. **Send Order**:
   - Handles 5.2M objects.
   - Processing time:
     - 200ms to "Approve Requisition".
     - 100ms to "Process Return".
     - 150ms to "End".
     - 100ms to "Create Invoice".
   - Transitions to:
     - "Approve Requisition".
     - "Process Return".
     - "End".
     - "Create Invoice".

8. **Check Stock**:
   - Handles 1.0M objects.
   - Processing time: 600ms.
   - Transitions to "Send Order".

9. **Process Return**:
   - Handles 0.8M objects.
   - Processing time: 500ms.
   - Transitions to:
     - "Send Order".
     - "Approve Payment".
     - "Create Invoice".

10. **Approve Payment**:
    - Handles 1.5M objects.
    - Processing time: 800ms.
    - Transitions to "Create Invoice".

11. **Create Invoice**:
    - Handles 2.0M objects.
    - Processing time: 100ms to "End".
    - Transitions to "End".

12. **Close Order**:
    - Handles 1.7M objects.
    - Processing time: 10ms.
    - Transitions to "End".

### End Points:
- Various "End" points indicating the final stage of each respective workflow.

### Summary:
The diagram presents a comprehensive view of transaction processes, showing the flow from various initial transaction items to their respective endpoints through multiple interconnected activities with specified processing times and object volumes. The workflow demonstrates how different types of orders and transactions are handled, approved, and processed, ultimately leading to the creation of invoices, delivery confirmations, and order closures.
