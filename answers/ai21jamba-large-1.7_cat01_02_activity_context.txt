### **Justification for Activity Renaming:**

1. **Submit Initial Request:**
Formerly "Initiate Request," explicitly clarifies it as the initial point of contact or submission. This prevents confusion as "Initiate" can be ambiguous.
2. **Verifying Initial ID Documents:**
Renamed from "Verify Documents" to emphasize that this verification occurs during the initial account check and doesn’t cover later checks.
3. **Call Customer for Missing ID Docs:**
Differentiates this from other customer calls by specifying its purpose: to resolve missing ID documents.
4. **Customer Submits Additional Docs:**
"Submit Additional" is imprecise. Renamed to show that this action is initiated by the customer.
5. **Re-Verify ID Documents:**
Renamed to indicate this verification is done after the customer submits additional documents or after adjustments.
6. **Outbound Call for Account Query:**
Renamed to highlight that this call is part of a broader query (e.g., account discrepancies).
7. **Adjust Internal Account Records:**
Formerly "Adjust Account," now clarifies that this activity refers to a back-office action for record correction.
8. **Confirmation Call to Customer:**
Shows a different purpose than the first customer call, specifically for confirming account changes.
9. **In-person Request Submission:**
Changed from "Initiate Request" to reflect that this activity happens in person at the branch, not via online submission.
10. **Call Customer to Return for Details:**
Highlights the specific scenario of needing a customer to return for ID or missing details.

These renaming decisions ensure activity names disambiguate between occurrences and clarify their purpose in the overall process flow.
