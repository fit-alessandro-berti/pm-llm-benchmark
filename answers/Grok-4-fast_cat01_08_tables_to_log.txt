**Assumptions Made:**
- Separate events are created for each item picked, each delivery (dispatch and arrival), each invoice issued, and each payment received, as these represent distinct activities with unique timestamps and resources.
- For order 1004, only "Order Created" and "Item Picked" events are included, as no delivery, invoice, or payment records exist in the provided data.
- The "Resource" for "Payment Received" events uses the payment method, as no specific actor is assigned.
- Timestamps are in UTC (as indicated by 'Z' in the original data) and have been parsed accordingly for sorting.
- Events are sorted chronologically within each case ID to reflect the process flow.
