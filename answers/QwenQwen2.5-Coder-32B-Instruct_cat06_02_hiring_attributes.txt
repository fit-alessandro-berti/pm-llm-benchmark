To determine which attributes are sensitive for fairness in your process, you need to identify attributes that could potentially be used to make discriminatory decisions or that reflect characteristics protected by anti-discrimination laws. In the context of the job application process, sensitive attributes often include:

1. **case:citizen** - This attribute indicates whether an applicant is a citizen or not. Making hiring decisions based on citizenship status can be discriminatory unless there is a legitimate reason, such as the job requiring clearance or access to sensitive information.

2. **case:gender** - This attribute indicates the gender of the applicant. Hiring decisions based solely on gender are illegal in most places. Gender should not affect an applicant's qualifications, skills, or ability to perform the job.

3. **case:german speaking** - Depending on the nature of the job, requiring a candidate to speak a specific language (such as German) may be reasonable if language proficiency is required for the job. However, if the job can be performed without this language requirement, this could be considered a discriminatory practice.

4. **case:religious** - Religious beliefs and practices should not influence hiring decisions. Relying on an applicant's religion for job actions is illegal and unethical.

It is important to note that other activities or attributes might also be sensitive depending on the context and jurisdictional rules. For instance, if you work in a jurisdiction where inquiries about an individual’s race or disability status are prohibited, these could also be considered sensitive attributes if present in your data.

### Next Steps

- **Legal Compliance**: Review local and federal laws about employment discrimination to determine if any additional attributes are sensitive in your specific case.
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate how these attributes might affect hiring decisions and outcomes to ensure fairness.
- **Process Refinement**: Ensure that the decisions made during the hiring process are based on job-relevant attributes and that any decision-making criteria are transparent and justified.

### Recommendations

Ensure that your hiring process is inclusive and does not inadvertently discriminate against any group of applicants:

- **Transparent Processes**: Clearly define job requirements and selection criteria.
- **Non-Discrimination Policies**: Implement and enforce policies that prohibit discrimination based on sensitive attributes.
- **Training**: Provide training for interviewers and decision-makers about fairness and the recognition of bias.

By focusing on these areas, you can help ensure that your hiring process is fair and compliant with relevant laws.
