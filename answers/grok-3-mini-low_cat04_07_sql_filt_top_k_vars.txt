First, the event log is in a DuckDB table called `event_log` with columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`.

A process variant is the ordered sequence of activities for a single case, sorted by timestamp.

My tasks:

1. Get the sequence of activities for each case_id, ordered by timestamp.

2. Group cases by their complete activity sequence to find unique variants.

3. Count the number of cases for each variant and find the top K variants by frequency.

4. Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases in these top K variants.

I need to write a single DuckDB SQL query that does all this.

To get the ordered sequence for each case, I can use STRING_AGG to concatenate the activities in order.

For each case_id, I need to aggregate the activities into a string, ordered by timestamp.

Something like:

SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS sequence

FROM event_log

GROUP BY case_id

That gives me a table with case_id and their sequence.

Then, I need to group these sequences and count how many cases have each sequence.

So, from that subquery, I can do another aggregation:

SELECT sequence, COUNT(case_id) AS frequency

FROM (the above subquery)

GROUP BY sequence

ORDER BY frequency DESC

LIMIT K? Wait, no, I need the top K, but then I have to use that to filter back to the original events.

To get the top K, I need to select the top K rows after grouping and ordering.

In SQL, to filter based on top K, I might need to use a window function or a subquery.

The problem is to return the events from cases that are in the top K variants.

So, steps in query:

1. First, compute the sequences per case.

2. Then, for those sequences, count the frequencies.

3. Get the top K sequences by frequency.

4. Then, find all case_ids that have those top K sequences.

5. Finally, select from the original event_log where case_id is in those case_ids.

That makes sense.

In SQL, I need to handle this efficiently.

DuckDB supports window functions and CTEs, so I can use those.

Let me sketch it out.

First, create a CTE for sequences:

WITH sequences AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

Then, get the frequencies:

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS frequency,

    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn

    FROM sequences

    GROUP BY variant_sequence

)

For top K, I can use ROW_NUMBER or just limit after ordering.

In variant_counts, I need to select the top K.

So,

top_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, frequency

    FROM (

        SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS frequency

        FROM sequences

        GROUP BY variant_sequence

        ORDER BY frequency DESC

        LIMIT K  -- Wait, but LIMIT in a subquery might not work directly for the whole query.

    ) sub

)

LIMIT in a subquery will limit the rows in that subquery, but I need to use it to filter later.

In top_variants, I'll have the top K variant_sequences.

Then, I need to join back to sequences to get the case_ids that have those variant_sequences.

So,

filtered_cases AS (

    SELECT s.case_id

    FROM sequences s

    JOIN top_variants tv ON s.variant_sequence = tv.variant_sequence

)

Finally, select from event_log where case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases)

Yes!

So, the full query would be:

WITH sequences AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_frequencies AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS frequency

    FROM sequences

    GROUP BY variant_sequence

),

top_k AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence

    FROM variant_frequencies

    ORDER BY frequency DESC

    LIMIT K  -- Assuming K is a parameter, but in the query, I need to replace with actual K or use a variable.

    Wait, in the prompt, it's "top K", so probably assume K is given, like 5 or something, but in the query, I'll use a placeholder.

),

filtered_cases AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id

    FROM sequences s

    JOIN top_k tk ON s.variant_sequence = tk.variant_sequence

)

SELECT e.*

FROM event_log e

JOIN filtered_cases fc ON e.case_id = fc.case_id

ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp  -- Maybe, to return in some order, but the prompt doesn't specify.

The prompt says: "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So, just select the events for those cases.

It doesn't specify order, but probably good to order by case_id and timestamp.

One issue: In top_k, I'm selecting variant_sequence, but if there are ties, ROW_NUMBER would arbitrarily pick, but since I'm using ORDER BY frequency DESC and LIMIT K, it will take the first K after ordering.

That might not be perfect if there are ties, but I think it's fine as per the prompt.

The prompt says "the top K variants by their frequency", so probably the first K after sorting.

In STRING_AGG, I need to make sure that the activities are aggregated in the correct order. I used ORDER BY timestamp, which is good.

One potential issue: If two activities have the same timestamp, the order might be arbitrary, but I think that's as per the data.

STRING_AGG will concatenate them into a string, like 'A,B,C', which is fine for grouping.

Assuming that the sequence is exactly that string.

If activities have commas or special chars, it might mess up, but let's assume they don't.

I could use ARRAY_AGG and then something, but STRING_AGG is straightforward.

DuckDB has ARRAY_AGG, which might be better for exact matching.

For grouping, as long as it's consistent, STRING_AGG should work, but ARRAY_AGG would create an array, and I can group by that array.

In SQL, grouping by an array should be fine in DuckDB.

Let me check: Yes, DuckDB supports arrays.

So, perhaps use ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

Then, variant_sequence is an array, like ['A', 'B', 'C']

That might be more precise than a string.

Yes, let's do that.

So, in sequences CTE:

SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

FROM event_log

GROUP BY case_id

In variant_frequencies:

SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS frequency

FROM sequences

GROUP BY variant_sequence  -- grouping by array

Yes.

The rest follows.

In the final select, return all columns from event_log, so SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (subquery)

In my earlier sketch, I used a JOIN, which is fine.

To make it efficient, JOIN might be better than IN with a subquery if there are many cases.

For the query, it's okay.

One more: The prompt says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. Cases not matching the top K variants should be excluded from the final result."

So, yes, exactly what I have.

I think that's it.

The prompt is to write the query, and it should be a single query, which this is, using CTEs.

About K: In the query, I need to specify K, like LIMIT 5, but since it's a parameter, I'll assume it's replaced, or in the answer, I can use a placeholder.

In the problem, it's "top K", so in the query, I'll write LIMIT K, but actually, in SQL, it needs a number, but for the answer, I can say assume K is given.

I can write it as is.

In the boxed answer, I'll write the query with LIMIT 5 or something, but better to keep it as K.

The prompt doesn't specify, so I'll use a variable or just write it.

In SQL queries, we can use a parameter, but for this, I'll just write LIMIT 10, say, or leave it as is.

To be precise, I'll write the query with LIMIT K, and assume it's replaced.

In the final answer, I'll make it clear.

Alright, let's write the query.
</think>

Below is the complete DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the tasks outlined in the prompt. This query:

1. Extracts the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id` using `ARRAY_AGG` to maintain the exact order based on `timestamp`.
2. Groups the sequences to identify unique process variants and counts the number of cases for each variant.
3. Determines the top K variants by frequency (i.e., the number of cases following that variant).
4. Filters the original event log to return only the events from cases that belong to these top K variants.

### Key Assumptions:
- `K` is a parameter that represents the number of top variants to consider (e.g., 5). In a real DuckDB environment, you can replace `K` with a specific integer or use a parameter if supported.
- Activities are aggregated into an array for precise matching of sequences. This avoids issues with string delimiters that might occur with `STRING_AGG`.
- If two activities in the same case have the same timestamp, their order in the array is determined by the database's sorting behavior (which is typically stable but not guaranteed).
- The query returns all columns from the original `event_log` table for the filtered cases, ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for readability (though the prompt doesn't explicitly require ordering).

### DuckDB SQL Query:

```sql
WITH 
-- Step 1: Extract the ordered sequence of activities for each case_id
sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence  -- Aggregates activities into an array, ordered by timestamp
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),

-- Step 2: Group by sequence and count the frequency of each variant
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT 
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS frequency  -- Count the number of cases for each variant
    FROM 
        sequences
    GROUP BY 
        variant_sequence
),

-- Step 3: Select the top K variants by frequency
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant_sequence
    FROM 
        variant_frequencies
    ORDER BY 
        frequency DESC  -- Order by frequency in descending order
    LIMIT K  -- Limit to the top K variants
),

-- Step 4: Get the case_ids that belong to the top K variants
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        s.case_id
    FROM 
        sequences s
    JOIN 
        top_k_variants tk ON s.variant_sequence = tk.variant_sequence  -- Join to filter cases with top K sequences
)

-- Final Step: Return all events from the original event_log for the filtered cases
SELECT 
    e.*  -- Select all columns from the original event_log
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    filtered_cases fc ON e.case_id = fc.case_id  -- Join to include only events from filtered cases
ORDER BY 
    e.case_id, e.timestamp;  -- Optional: Order by case_id and timestamp for logical output
```

### Explanation of the Query:
- **sequences CTE**: This computes the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id` by grouping the events and using `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`. The result is an array of activities for each case.
- **variant_frequencies CTE**: This groups the sequences from the `sequences` CTE and counts how many cases share each unique sequence (variant).
- **top_k_variants CTE**: This selects the sequences from `variant_frequencies`, orders them by frequency in descending order, and limits the result to the top K variants.
- **filtered_cases CTE**: This joins the `sequences` CTE with `top_k_variants` to identify the specific `case_id`s that belong to the top K variants.
- **Final SELECT**: This queries the original `event_log` table and joins it with `filtered_cases` to return only the events from the cases in the top K variants. The results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity.

### How to Execute:
- Replace `K` with an actual integer (e.g., 5) when running the query in DuckDB.
- Example: If you want the top 3 variants, change `LIMIT K` to `LIMIT 3`.
- Ensure the `event_log` table is already loaded in your DuckDB database.

This query is efficient and uses standard SQL features available in DuckDB, such as CTEs and array aggregation, to handle the tasks in a single execution. If you have any specific values for K or additional constraints, the query can be adjusted accordingly.
