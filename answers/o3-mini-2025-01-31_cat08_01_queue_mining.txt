Below is a structured, detailed approach to using process and queue mining techniques to identify and mitigate the queuing issues at the clinic:


1. Queue Identification and Characterization

a. Calculating Waiting Times  
• Define “waiting time” as the time interval between the completion of a preceding activity and the start of the subsequent activity within a patient’s visit. For example, the waiting time between Registration and Nurse Assessment is computed as:  
Waiting Time = (Timestamp of Nurse Assessment START) – (Timestamp of Registration COMPLETE)  
• Use the event log’s start and completion timestamps to derive these intervals for each case (patient visit).

b. Key Metrics to Calculate  
• Average Waiting Time per queue (mean across all cases)  
• Median Waiting Time (to understand the central tendency and reduce the effect of extreme cases)  
• Maximum Waiting Time and the 90th Percentile (to capture outliers and cases with excessive delays)  
• Queue Frequency: the number of cases passing through each queue, and the proportion that experience waiting times above a predefined threshold (e.g., excessive wait defined as >15 minutes)  
• Percentage of cases impacted (to see which queues affect a significant portion of visits)

c. Identifying Critical Queues  
• Look for queues with the longest average and 90th percentile waiting times.  
• Consider the frequency: a queue that affects a majority of patient cases can have a bigger impact even if its average wait is moderate.  
• Analyze the impact on patient satisfaction by segmenting by patient type (e.g., Urgent vs. New vs. Follow-up) and assessing where delays are most critical.  
• For instance, if Nurse Assessment delays are frequent and very long, and these delays are more pronounced for urgent cases or new patients, it becomes a primary candidate for improvement.


2. Root Cause Analysis

a. Potential Root Causes of Queues  
• Resource Bottlenecks – Limited staff availability (e.g., nurse or doctor shortages) or insufficient room/equipment allocation might be causing delays in service start times.  
• Handovers and Activity Dependencies – Activities that are sequential in nature (e.g., Registration to Nurse Assessment to Doctor Consultation) may accumulate delays due to inefficient handovers.  
• Variability in Activity Durations – Inconsistent service times can create backups; for example, if some doctor consultations are prolonged while others are not.  
• Appointment Scheduling Policies – Overbooking or poorly staggered appointments can lead to peaks in patient arrivals, creating congestion at specific steps.  
• Patient Arrival Patterns – Walk-ins or unscheduled gatherings could overload a queue if they coincide with scheduled appointments.  
• Patient Segmentation Differences – New patients may require more prep work or information, extending wait times compared to follow-up cases.

b. Process Mining Techniques to Pinpoint Causes  
• Resource Analysis: Map resource utilization and identify idle vs. busy periods. This can reveal whether certain staff members or rooms are over-utilized or under-utilized.  
• Bottleneck Analysis: Analyze the rework or delay patterns at handover points (e.g., from Registration to Nurse Assessment) to see where delays pile up.  
• Process Variant Analysis: Compare different paths (or variants) taken by new versus follow-up or urgent patients to spot where some paths lag significantly.  
• Time-Slice Analysis: Investigate differences in the process during peak vs. off-peak hours to understand if patient arrival patterns or scheduling issues are contributing to long wait times.


3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

a. Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation  
• Target Queue(s): Nurse Assessment and Doctor Consultation queues.  
• Root Cause: Resource bottlenecks and inefficient allocation during peak periods.  
• Proposal: Use the historical process data to identify peak times and dynamically reallocate resources (e.g., schedule additional nurses or doctors on shift, or allow flexible roles that can assist in multiple steps).  
• Data Support: Analysis showing spikes in waiting times during certain hours supports the need for more staffing or shift adjustments.  
• Expected Impact: Could reduce the average wait time by 20–30% during peak periods, thereby decreasing overall cycle time.

b. Strategy 2: Revised Appointment Scheduling and Patient Segmentation  
• Target Queue(s): Registration and Nurse Assessment queues.  
• Root Cause: Poor scheduling leading to bursts of patient arrivals; one-size-fits-all appointment durations that disadvantage new and urgent cases.  
• Proposal: Implement a differentiated scheduling system that allocates time slots based on patient type and urgency, and staggers appointments more evenly throughout the day.  
• Data Support: Variance in cycle times for urgent vs. regular patients and evidence of clustering from arrival pattern analysis.  
• Expected Impact: Smoothing out patient arrivals can reduce waiting times by up to 25% and improve patient satisfaction by reducing peaks in workload.

c. Strategy 3: Parallelizing Activities Where Possible  
• Target Queue(s): Waiting times between diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG, Blood Test) and subsequent consultation stages.  
• Root Cause: Sequential process design which forces patients to wait for one activity to fully complete before scheduling the next.  
• Proposal: Where clinically appropriate, redesign the workflow to allow some activities to occur in parallel. For instance, while waiting for a diagnostic test to be set up, patients could engage in preliminary documentation or counseling that is both informative and resource-light.  
• Data Support: Cases where parallel processing might have been possible (as evidenced by overlapping timestamps or idle resource times) can be used as a benchmark.  
• Expected Impact: Expected to reduce overall visit duration by 15–20%, thereby easing congestion in subsequent queues.


4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

a. Potential Trade-offs  
• Resource Shifting: Adding staff or reallocating them might relieve one bottleneck but could stress resources in another area if not balanced properly.  
• Cost Implications: Increasing staffing or implementing new technology can raise operational costs, which must be carefully balanced against the benefits of reduced waiting times.  
• Impact on Quality of Care: Speeding through processes might risk diminishing the thoroughness of care if not implemented carefully; for example, a highly parallel process may lead to less direct patient-staff interaction.  
• Impact on Staff Workload: Changes in scheduling or increased parallel tasks might raise staff workload and require additional training or adjustments in roles.

b. Balancing Conflicting Objectives  
• Use multi-objective optimization: Prioritize strategies that offer significant reductions in wait times while keeping cost increases minimal.  
• Pilot implementations and simulations: Before a full roll-out, run pilots to identify unintended consequences and adjust resource allocation accordingly.  
• Stakeholder engagement: Include feedback from medical staff and administrative personnel to ensure that efficiency improvements do not compromise quality.  
• Monitor KPIs in real time, allowing for agile adjustments if the surpluses are shifting the bottleneck or if staff burnout becomes an issue.


5. Measuring Success

a. Suggested KPIs  
• Average and 90th percentile waiting times per queue, tracked on a daily or weekly basis.  
• Overall visit duration—from Registration start to Check-out completion.  
• Resource utilization rates to ensure balanced workloads.  
• Patient satisfaction scores (captured via post-visit surveys) and the number of complaints specifically related to waiting times.  
• Percentage reduction in cases experiencing “excessive” wait times (e.g., waiting >15 minutes).

b. Ongoing Process Monitoring  
• Continue to use the event-log structure to perform real-time or near-real-time tracking of the above KPIs.  
• Set up dashboards that visualize queue lengths, waiting times, and resource utilization so that management can detect emerging bottlenecks.  
• Schedule periodic process mining and variant analysis to compare pre- and post-implementation performance using the same measurement criteria.  
• Use a feedback loop where patient and staff feedback is continuously integrated with the operational data to fine-tune strategies.


Conclusion

This comprehensive, data-driven approach leverages detailed event log analysis to not only pinpoint critical queues but also to understand their root causes. By deploying targeted strategies—from dynamic resource management and refined appointment scheduling to parallel process designs—and by constantly monitoring performance through KPIs, the clinic can achieve significant reductions in wait times and overall visit durations while balancing cost, resource utilization, and care quality.
