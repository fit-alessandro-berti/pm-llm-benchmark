<think>
We are given multiple tables: Orders, Order Lines, Delivery, Invoice, Payments, and optionally Products and Resources.

 Steps:
 1. Identify Cases: Use `order_id` as the case identifier.
 2. Derive Activities: We will create events for key steps:
    - Order Created: from Orders table (order_date)
    - Items Picked: from Order Lines table (item_picking_date) for each item in the order
    - Order Dispatched: from Delivery table (delivery_dispatch_date) - note: one order may have multiple deliveries? But in the example, each order has one delivery record? However, the problem says "orders can be delivered in multiple shipments", so we might have multiple delivery records per order_id. But note: the Delivery table has one record per delivery, and an order can have multiple deliveries. So we should create one event per delivery record? But the activity name for a delivery record could be "Order Dispatched" (if that's the event in the delivery table) and "Order Arrived" for the delivery arrival.

    However, looking at the problem statement:
      - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from the `Delivery` table.

    So for each delivery record, we can have two events? But note: the problem says "event" per activity. Alternatively, we can have one event per delivery record that includes both dispatch and arrival? But that would be two events per delivery record.

    But the problem says: "produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful". So we can break down:

    For each delivery record, we can have:
      - Event: "Order Dispatched" with timestamp = delivery_dispatch_date
      - Event: "Order Arrived" with timestamp = delivery_arrival_date

    However, note that the problem says: "each event should have a timestamp". And if we have multiple items, we might have multiple picking events? But the problem says for items picked, we have an event per item? Or per order? The problem says: "Items Picked" event(s) from the Order Lines table.

    So we will create one event per item picked? But note: the Order Lines table has one row per item. So we can have multiple "Items Picked" events for the same order.

    Similarly, for the delivery, we have two events per delivery record? But wait: the Delivery table has one record per delivery shipment. So if an order is split into multiple shipments, then we have multiple delivery records. Therefore, we can have:

      For each order:
        - Order Created (1 event)
        - For each item in the order (from Order Lines): Items Picked (1 event per item)
        - For each delivery record of the order (which may be multiple): 
            - Order Dispatched (on the dispatch date)
            - Order Arrived (on the arrival date)

    But note: the problem says "Infer activity names logically". Also, the Delivery table might have one record per shipment? So an order might have multiple shipments. Therefore, we should create events per shipment.

    However, the problem does not specify if an order can have multiple deliveries. But the Delivery table has a `delivery_id` and `order_id` and also a `delivery_note`. So we assume that each row in Delivery is a shipment.

    So for each shipment (delivery record) we have two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived".

    Then for the Invoice table: 
        - "Invoice Issued" event for each invoice (one per invoice) on the `invoice_issue_date`

    Then for Payments:
        - "Payment Received" event for each payment (on the `payment_date`)

    But note: the problem says "every event for every `order_id` is included". However, payments are per invoice, not per order. But the event log should capture all events. Also, the payments table has `invoice_id` and `payment_date`. So we can create events per payment.

 3. Map Timestamps: 
    - For Order Created: use `order_date` from Orders table.
    - For Items Picked: use `item_picking_date` from Order Lines for each item. Note: if the same order has multiple items, we will have multiple rows. But note: the timestamp per item might be different? So we create one row per item per event.
    - For Order Dispatched and Order Arrived: use the `delivery_dispatch_date` and `delivery_arrival_date` from the Delivery table per delivery record (per shipment).
    - For Invoice Issued: use `invoice_issue_date` from Invoice table per invoice.
    - For Payment Received: use `payment_date` from Payments table per payment.

 4. Combine Data: We will link the events using the order_id and also the delivery_id (for delivery events) and invoice_id (for invoice events) and payment_id (for payment events). But note: the events for the same order should be in chronological order.

 5. Enrich with Resources and Attributes: 
    - We can get the sales person from the Orders table (sales_person_id) and map to resource_name via Resources table? But note: the problem says "Resource/Actor" (optional). And the Orders table has sales_person_id. We can use that for the Order Created event? But also, for the Items Picked, we have picker_id (from Order Lines) which is a warehouse staff. We can map picker_id to resource_name via Resources table.

    However, note: the problem says "if the tables contain information about which department or user performed the activity". So we can do:

      - For Order Created: resource = sales_person_id (from Orders) -> resource_name
      - For Items Picked: resource = picker_id (from Order Lines) -> resource_name
      - For Order Dispatched: resource = ? The Delivery table doesn't have a resource for the carrier? But note: the problem says "Resource/Actor" (optional). We might not have it for every event. But if we do, we can use:
          - For Order Dispatched: we don't have a clear resource? The carrier is the one that dispatches? But the event is about the order being dispatched. The Delivery table has carrier_id. We can use that? But note: the event is for the order, so maybe the warehouse staff? However, the problem doesn't specify. Since it's optional, we might skip or use the carrier? But the problem says "the user, department, or system entity responsible for the event". The carrier is responsible for delivering, but the dispatch event might be done by the warehouse staff. We don't have an explicit resource for the warehouse in the delivery event. So we might leave it out? Alternatively, we can use the sales person again? 

      Actually, the problem doesn't require it to be mandatory. So we can include when available.

      Let's plan:

        Activity: Order Dispatched
        Resource: carrier_id (from Delivery) -> resource_name

        Similarly, for Order Arrived: same carrier?

      But note: the problem says "Infer activity names logically". So we can assign:

        - Order Dispatched: carrier of the delivery? But the event is about the dispatch of the order by the carrier? 
        - Order Arrived: same carrier? 

      Alternatively, we might not have that information. So we can leave the resource out for these? Or we can use the same resource (carrier) for both? But the problem says "if available".

      Since the Resources table has carrier IDs (CR-01, CR-02, CR-03) and we have carrier_id in Delivery, we can map.

      Similarly, for Invoice Issued: we don't have a resource? The billing clerk? We have billing_person_id in the Invoice table. We can map to resource_name.

      For Payment Received: we don't have a resource? The payment was made by the customer? Or by the company? We don't have an actor? So we might skip.

    So we can do:

      - Order Created: resource = sales_person_id (from Orders) -> resource_name
      - Items Picked: resource = picker_id (from Order Lines) -> resource_name
      - Order Dispatched: resource = carrier_id (from Delivery) -> resource_name
      - Order Arrived: resource = carrier_id (from Delivery) -> resource_name
      - Invoice Issued: resource = billing_person_id (from Invoice) -> resource_name
      - Payment Received: no resource? -> leave empty? Or we can use the payment_reference? But that's not a resource.

    However, note: the problem says "Resource/Actor" (optional). So we can include when available.

 6. Chronological Order: We must ensure the events for a given order are in chronological order. We have events from:
      - Order Created (earliest)
      - Items Picked (multiple, must be sorted by item_picking_date)
      - Then for each delivery shipment: 
            Order Dispatched (delivery_dispatch_date)
            Order Arrived (delivery_arrival_date)
      - Then Invoice Issued (invoice_issue_date) for each invoice? But note: invoices can be issued at any time after the order? And payments can come after. We are just logging the events.

    But note: the problem says "maintain chronological correctness". So we will sort by timestamp.

 7. Missing Data: 
    - The Order Lines table has `item_picking_date` for each item. We use that for the "Items Picked" event.
    - The Delivery table has `delivery_dispatch_date` and `delivery_arrival_date` for each shipment.
    - The Invoice table has `invoice_issue_date` for each invoice.
    - The Payments table has `payment_date` for each payment.

    However, note: the same order might have multiple invoices and multiple payments. So we will have multiple events for the same order? Yes.

    Also, note: the problem says "every event for every order_id". So we must include every event for every order.

 8. Structure of the Event Log:

    | Case ID (order_id) | Activity Name         | Timestamp                  | Resource/Actor (optional) | Other Attributes (if any) |

    What other attributes? The problem says "if available". We don't have explicit other attributes in the tables? But we can include:

      - For Items Picked: we have quantity? But the problem doesn't specify. The activity is per item, but we are creating one row per item per event? Then we might include the quantity? But the problem says "at a minimum" the columns. So we can leave it out? Or we can add as an attribute? The problem doesn't specify.

    Since the problem says "if available", and we don't have a clear requirement, we can skip. But note: the problem says "Other Attributes (if available)".

    Alternatively, we can include:

      - For Order Created: order_id is already the case, so no need.
      - For Items Picked: we can include the item_id and quantity? But the problem says "per activity". The activity is "Items Picked", so we are already capturing the event per item. But the problem doesn't specify.

    We'll stick to the minimum: only the columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor.

    However, note: the problem says "produce a comprehensive event log". We are to include the minimum and then optional. So we can stop at the four columns.

 9. Steps for each order:

    Step 1: Order Created event (from Orders table)
        - Activity Name: "Order Created"
        - Timestamp: order_date
        - Resource: sales_person_id (from Orders) -> resource_name

    Step 2: For each order line (each item) in the order:
        - Activity Name: "Items Picked"
        - Timestamp: item_picking_date (from Order Lines)
        - Resource: picker_id (from Order Lines) -> resource_name

    Step 3: For each delivery record (shipment) in the order:
        - Activity: "Order Dispatched"
        - Timestamp: delivery_dispatch_date
        - Resource: carrier_id (from Delivery) -> resource_name

        - Activity: "Order Arrived"
        - Timestamp: delivery_arrival_date
        - Resource: carrier_id (from Delivery) -> resource_name

    Step 4: For each invoice of the order:
        - Activity: "Invoice Issued"
        - Timestamp: invoice_issue_date
        - Resource: billing_person_id (from Invoice) -> resource_name

    Step 5: For each payment of the order (each payment record):
        - Activity: "Payment Received"
        - Timestamp: payment_date
        - Resource: ? (we don't have, so leave empty)

    But note: the payments are per invoice, not per order. So we are including every payment.

 10. Example for order 1001:

      Orders: 
        order_id: 1001, order_date: 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z, sales_person_id: SP-001

      Order Lines: 
        Two items: 
          ITEM-001: picking date 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z -> event1
          ITEM-002: picking date 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z -> event2

      Delivery: 
        delivery_dispatch_date: 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z -> event3: "Order Dispatched"
        delivery_arrival_date: 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z -> event4: "Order Arrived"

      Invoice: 
        invoice_issue_date: 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z -> event5: "Invoice Issued"

      Payment: 
        payment_date: 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z -> event6: "Payment Received"

      Resources:
        sales_person_id SP-001 -> Alice Brown (from Resources table)
        picker_id for item 1: WH-001 -> David Lin
        picker_id for item 2: WH-002 -> Eva Johnson
        carrier_id for delivery: CR-01 -> GlobalTransport
        billing_person_id for invoice: BL-001 -> Gina Carter

      Chronological order:
        2024-01-01T09:00:00Z: Order Created (Alice Brown)
        2024-01-02T10:15:00Z: Items Picked (David Lin) -> item1
        2024-01-02T11:00:00Z: Items Picked (Eva Johnson) -> item2
        2024-01-03T08:30:00Z: Order Dispatched (GlobalTransport)
        2024-01-05T14:45:00Z: Order Arrived (GlobalTransport)
        2024-01-06T09:00:00Z: Invoice Issued (Gina Carter)
        2024-01-10T11:30:00Z: Payment Received (no resource)

 11. Implementation:

    We will create a table for each order? Then combine? But we have multiple orders.

    Steps:

      a) From Orders: create a row for each order: Order Created event.
      b) From Order Lines: for each (order_id, item_id, quantity, item_picking_date, picker_id) create one row per item: Items Picked event.
      c) From Delivery: for each (delivery_id, order_id, delivery_dispatch_date, delivery_arrival_date, carrier_id) we create two events: 
          - One row: Activity "Order Dispatched", Timestamp = delivery_dispatch_date, Resource = carrier_id (mapped to resource_name)
          - Another row: Activity "Order Arrived", Timestamp = delivery_arrival_date, Resource = carrier_id
      But note: the Delivery table has one record per delivery_id. So we can iterate over each delivery record and create two events.

      d) From Invoice: for each (invoice_id, order_id, invoice_issue_date, billing_person_id) create one row: Invoice Issued event.
      e) From Payment: for each (payment_id, invoice_id, payment_date) create one row: Payment Received event (without resource).

      Then we must sort all events by timestamp for each order? Actually, we can do:

        For each order_id, we will have multiple events. We will generate all events for the order and then sort by timestamp.

      f) Then we combine all events for all orders? But the problem says per order. So we will have one table per order? Or one table for all? The output is one table per event (so one row per event) and the Case ID is the order_id. So we can have multiple rows per order_id? Yes.

      We'll generate events for every order and every event, then sort by timestamp across all orders? But the problem doesn't specify if we need to preserve the order instance in the timeline? Actually, the event log should be in chronological order of the events. So we sort by timestamp.

      However, note: the problem says "maintain chronological correctness". So we must sort by timestamp.

      But note: events from different orders can have the same timestamp? Then we can break ties arbitrarily? Or by order_id? The problem doesn't specify.

      We'll sort by timestamp, and then by order_id (and then by activity name?) to have a deterministic order.

 12. Let's create the events for all orders:

    We'll create a list of events.

    Steps:

      events = []

      For each order in Orders:
        event1 = {
          Case ID: order_id,
          Activity Name: "Order Created",
          Timestamp: order_date,
          Resource: sales_person_id (from Orders) mapped to resource_name (from Resources table) -> if not found, leave empty?
        }

        events.append(event1)

        For each row in Order Lines for this order_id:
          event2 = {
            Case ID: order_id,
            Activity Name: "Items Picked",
            Timestamp: item_picking_date,
            Resource: picker_id (from Order Lines) mapped to resource_name (from Resources table)
          }
          events.append(event2)

        For each delivery record in Delivery for this order_id (we have multiple delivery records? Yes, if there are multiple shipments):
          For each delivery record:
            event3 = {
              Case ID: order_id,
              Activity Name: "Order Dispatched",
              Timestamp: delivery_dispatch_date,
              Resource: carrier_id (from Delivery) mapped to resource_name
            }
            events.append(event3)

            event4 = {
              Case ID: order_id,
              Activity Name: "Order Arrived",
              Timestamp: delivery_arrival_date,
              Resource: carrier_id (from Delivery) mapped to resource_name
            }
            events.append(event4)

        For each invoice in Invoice for this order_id:
          event5 = {
            Case ID: order_id,
            Activity Name: "Invoice Issued",
            Timestamp: invoice_issue_date,
            Resource: billing_person_id (from Invoice) mapped to resource_name
          }
          events.append(event5)

        For each payment in Payments for this order_id? Actually, payments are per invoice. So we need to get all payments that are for this order? But note: the Payments table has invoice_id. So we can get payments for the order by: all payments that have an invoice_id belonging to the order.

        How to get payments for the order? We can do:

          payments = [row for row in Payments if row['order_id'] == order_id]  # but note: the Payments table doesn't have order_id? It has invoice_id. So we must link by invoice_id? But the event is per payment. And the payment is for an invoice of the order.

        However, the problem says: the Payments table has invoice_id. So we can get the invoices for the order? Then get payments for those invoices.

        Alternatively, we can precompute for each order the payments? But note: the same payment might be for multiple invoices? No, one payment per invoice? The problem says "invoices may be paid in one or multiple installments", so one payment per invoice? But the Payments table has invoice_id. So one payment per invoice.

        So for each payment in Payments that has an invoice_id that is in the Invoice table for this order_id:

          event6 = {
            Case ID: order_id,
            Activity Name: "Payment Received",
            Timestamp: payment_date,
            Resource: ""   # not available
          }
          events.append(event6)

      Then sort events by timestamp.

 13. However, note: the same event might be duplicated? We are building the events per table.

 14. We must map the resource_id to resource_name in the Resources table. We need to do a left join? But we are building a list of events. We can create a mapping:

      resource_map = {}
      for row in Resources:
          resource_map[row['resource_id']] = row['resource_name']

      Then for each event that has a resource_id, we do:
          event['Resource'] = resource_map.get(resource_id, resource_id)   # if not found, leave as the resource_id? Or leave empty? The problem says "if available". So if we don't find, we can leave empty? Or use the resource_id? We'll leave empty.

 15. Let's code the mapping and then generate the events.

  But note: we are in a markdown table. We cannot write code. We are to produce the final table.

  We'll simulate for the given orders.

  Steps:

    Precompute a mapping for resources.

    Then for each order in Orders (we have order_id, order_date, sales_person_id):

      event_order_created = {
        'Case ID': order_id,
        'Activity Name': 'Order Created',
        'Timestamp': order_date,
        'Resource/Actor': resource_map.get(sales_person_id, None)   # if sales_person_id is in the map, use the name, else None (we'll leave blank in the table? Or put the sales_person_id? We'll put the name if found, else we leave blank? The problem says "if available", so if not available we leave blank.
      }

    Then for each row in Order Lines for this order_id:

      item_row = row from Order Lines for this order_id and this item

      event_pick = {
        'Case ID': order_id,
        'Activity Name': 'Items Picked',
        'Timestamp': item_row['item_picking_date'],
        'Resource/Actor': resource_map.get(item_row['picker_id'], None)
      }

    Then for each row in Delivery for this order_id:

      delivery_row = row from Delivery for this order_id

      event_dispatch = {
        'Case ID': order_id,
        'Activity Name': 'Order Dispatched',
        'Timestamp': delivery_row['delivery_dispatch_date'],
        'Resource/Actor': resource_map.get(delivery_row['carrier_id'], None)
      }

      event_arrived = {
        'Case ID': order_id,
        'Activity Name': 'Order Arrived',
        'Timestamp': delivery_row['delivery_arrival_date'],
        'Resource/Actor': resource_map.get(delivery_row['carrier_id'], None)
      }

    Then for each row in Invoice for this order_id:

      invoice_row = row from Invoice for this order_id

      event_invoice = {
        'Case ID': order_id,
        'Activity Name': 'Invoice Issued',
        'Timestamp': invoice_row['invoice_issue_date'],
        'Resource/Actor': resource_map.get(invoice_row['billing_person_id'], None)
      }

    Then for each row in Payments that has an invoice_id in the Invoice table for this order_id? But note: the Payments table doesn't have order_id. We have to link by invoice_id? But the same invoice might be paid in multiple payments? The problem says "invoices may be paid in one or multiple installments". So the Payments table has multiple payments per invoice? Then we can get:

      payments_for_order = [pay for pay in Payments if pay['invoice_id'] in [inv['invoice_id'] for inv in Invoices_for_order]]

    But we don't have the Invoices_for_order? We can precompute a mapping from order_id to invoices.

    Alternatively, we can do:

      First, create a mapping from invoice_id to order_id? Because an invoice belongs to one order? Yes, the Invoice table has order_id. So we can get the order_id from the invoice.

      Then, for a given order_id, we can get the invoices for that order (we already have that from the Invoice table for this order_id). Then for each invoice_id of that order, get all payments in the Payments table for that invoice_id.

    So:

      For order_id in Orders:

        invoices = [inv for inv in Invoice if inv['order_id'] == order_id]

        for inv in invoices:
          payment_rows = [pay for pay in Payments if pay['invoice_id'] == inv['invoice_id']]
          for pay in payment_rows:
            event_payment = {
              'Case ID': order_id,
              'Activity Name': 'Payment Received',
              'Timestamp': pay['payment_date'],
              'Resource/Actor': None   # not available
            }
            events.append(event_payment)

    Then we have events for all orders.

 16. But note: the same event might be missing? We are covering all.

 17. Finally, we sort the events by Timestamp.

 18. Then we output the table in Markdown.

  However, note: the problem says "provide the final event log as a structured table (in Markdown format)".

  We have to generate a Markdown table with columns:

      Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource/Actor

  But note: the problem says "Other Attributes" if available. We are not including any other attributes.

 19. We'll generate the events for the given data.

  Let's do it step by step for the provided data.

  Precomputation:

    Resources mapping:

      resource_map = {
        'SP-001': 'Alice Brown',
        'SP-002': 'Bob Smith',
        'SP-003': 'Charlie Kim',
        'WH-001': 'David Lin',
        'WH-002': 'Eva Johnson',
        'WH-003': 'Frank Miller',
        'CR-01': 'GlobalTransport',

      7. Payment Received: '2024-01-15T12:00:00Z'

 20. Now, we have to sort all events by timestamp.

    We'll collect all events and sort by the Timestamp.

    We'll create a list of events with the structure:

        [ {Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor}, ... ]

    Then sort by Timestamp.

 21. Output the Markdown table.

  However, note: the problem says "provide the final event log as a structured table (in Markdown format)".

  We'll generate the Markdown table with the columns:

      | Case ID | Activity Name       | Timestamp                  | Resource/Actor |
      |---------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------|

  And then the rows.

  But note: the problem says "if data is missing or ambiguous, document any assumptions made". We have assumed that the resource mapping is as provided in the Resources table. If a resource_id is not found, we leave the cell empty.

  We'll now generate the events in chronological order.

  Let's list all timestamps:

    Order 1001:
      2024-01-01T09:00:00Z (Order Created)
      2024-01-02T10:15:00Z (Items Picked)

      2024-01-06T09:00:00Z (Invoice Issued)
      2024-01-10T11:30:00Z (Payment Received)

    Order 1002:
      2024-01-02T12:30:00Z (Order Created)
      2024-01-03T09:45:00Z (Items Picked)
      2024-01-03T10:00:00Z (Items Picked)
      2024-01-04T07:20:00Z (Order Dispatched)
      2024-01-05T07:00:00Z (Order Dispatched)   [second delivery]
      2024-01-07T16:10:00Z (Order Arrived)
      2024-01-08T10:15:00Z (Invoice Issued)

      2024-01-12T14:00:00Z (Payment Received)
      2024-01-15T09:00:00Z (Payment Received)

    Order 1003:
      2024-01-03T10:00:00Z (Order Created)
      2024-01-05T15:30:00Z (Items Picked)
      2024-01-05T15:45:00Z (Items Picked)
      2024-01-06T07:30:00Z (Order Dispatched)
      2024-01-07T20:00:00Z (Order Arrived)
      2024-01-09T08:00:00Z (Invoice Issued)
      2024-01-11T10:30:00Z (Payment Received)

    Order 1004:
      2024-01-04T14:15:00Z (Order Created)
      2024-01-06T08:00:00Z (Items Picked)
      2024-01-07T10:15:00Z (Order Dispatched)
      2024-01-09T11:45:00Z (Order Arrived)
      2024-01-09T08:00:00Z (Invoice Issued)   # note: this is at the same time as the dispatch? But the timestamp is 2024-01-09T08:00:00Z for both? Then we break by order? 1004: order_created at 14:15 on 1004, then items_picked on 06, then dispatch on 07, then arrival on 09, then invoice issued on 09? But the invoice issued is at 08:00 on 09? So before dispatch? That doesn't make sense. We must check the data.

        The Invoice issued for 1004: '2024-01-09T08:00:00Z'
        The Order Dispatched for 1004: '2024-01-07T10:15:00Z'
        The Order Arrived: '2024-01-09T11:45:00Z'

        So the invoice issued is on 2024-01-09 at 08:00, which is before the dispatch and arrival? That is unusual because the invoice should be issued after the order is dispatched? But we don't have a business rule. We'll log as is.

    Order 1005:
      2024-01-05T08:45:00Z (Order Created)
      2024-01-06T09:30:00Z (Items Picked)
      2024-01-06T09:45:00Z (Items Picked)
      2024-01-07T10:15:00Z (Order Dispatched)
      2024-01-09T11:45:00Z (Order Arrived)
      2024-01-10T09:30:00Z (Invoice Issued)
      2024-01-15T12:00:00Z (Payment Received)

  Now, we sort all events by timestamp.

  We'll list all timestamps in order:

    2024-01-01T09:00:00Z: 1001, Order Created
    2024-01-02T10:15:00Z: 1001, Items Picked (first item)
    2024-01-02T11:00:00Z: 1001, Items Picked (second item)
    2024-01-02T12:30:00Z: 1002, Order Created
    2024-01-03T08:30:00Z: 1001, Order Dispatched
    2024-01-03T09:45:00Z: 1002, Items Picked (first item)
    2024-01-03T10:00:00Z: 1002, Items Picked (second item)
    2024-01-04T07:20:00Z: 1002, Order Dispatched (first delivery)
    2024-01-04T14:15:00Z: 1004, Order Created
    2024-01-05T07:00:00Z: 1002, Order Dispatched (second delivery)
    2024-01-05T08:00:00Z: 1004, Invoice Issued? But wait, the invoice issued for 1004 is at 2024-01-09T08:00:00Z? So we don't have an event at 2024-01-05? 
        Actually, we have:
          1004: 
            Order Created: 2024-01-04T14:15:00Z
            Items Picked: 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z
            Order Dispatched: 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z
            Order Arrived: 2024-01-09T11:45:00Z
            Invoice Issued: 2024-01-09T08:00:00Z   -> this is at 2024-01-09, so after the dispatch and arrival? 

        So we don't have an event on 2024-01-05 for 1004.

    Instead, we have:

        2024-01-05T14:45:00Z: 1001, Order Arrived
        2024-01-06T08:00:00Z: 1004, Items Picked
        2024-01-06T09:30:00Z: 1005, Items Picked (first item)
        2024-01-06T09:45:00Z: 1005, Items Picked (second item)
        2024-01-06T10:15:00Z: 1004, Order Dispatched? But the delivery dispatch is at 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z? 
            Actually, the delivery dispatch for 1004 is at 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z.

        So we have:

          2024-01-07T10:15:00Z: 1004, Order Dispatched
          2024-01-07T10:15:00Z: 1005, Order Dispatched   (same timestamp? but different order)

        Then:

          2024-01-09T08:00:00Z: 1004, Invoice Issued   -> but wait, we have 1004: Invoice Issued at 2024-01-09T08:00:00Z? 
          2024-01-09T08:00:00Z: 1004, Invoice Issued
          2024-01-09T11:45:00Z: 1004, Order Arrived
          2024-01-09T11:45:00Z: 1005, Order Arrived
          2024-01-10T09:30:00Z: 1005, Invoice Issued
          2024-01-10T11:00:00Z: 1002, Invoice Issued (second invoice)
          2024-01-10T11:30:00Z: 1001, Payment Received
          2024-01-11T10:30:00Z: 1003, Payment Received
          2024-01-12T14:00:00Z: 1002, Payment Received (first payment)
          2024-01-15T09:00:00Z: 1002, Payment Received (second payment)
          2024-01-15T09:00:00Z: 1005, Payment Received

  But note: the order of events with the same timestamp? We break by order_id and then by activity name? The problem doesn't specify. We'll break by timestamp (and then by the order we generated? but we don't have a primary key). We'll break by the activity name? Or by the order_id? 

  We'll break ties by the order_id and then by the activity name? But the problem says "maintain chronological correctness", and if the timestamps are equal, the business might have an order. We'll do:

      Sort by timestamp, then by Case ID, then by Activity Name? 

  But note: the same order_id might have multiple events at the same time? Then we break by the natural order we created? But we don't have a sequence. We'll break by the activity name? 

  Alternatively, we can break by the order_id and then by the activity name? 

  We'll do:

      events_sorted = sorted(events, key=lambda e: (e['Timestamp'], e['Case ID'], e['Activity Name']))

  But note: the same timestamp for different order_ids: we break by order_id? 

  However, the problem does not specify. We'll do:

      key = (timestamp, case_id, activity_name)

  But note: the same case_id might have two activities at the same timestamp? Then we break by the order of the activities in the generation? But we don't have a generation order. We'll break by the activity name? 

  We'll do:

      sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda e: (e['Timestamp'], e['Case ID'], e['Activity Name']))

  Now, we generate the Markdown table.

  Due to the large number of events, we'll generate the entire table.

  We'll write the Markdown table with the sorted events.

  Note: We must include every event for every order_id.

  We'll now write the Markdown table.
