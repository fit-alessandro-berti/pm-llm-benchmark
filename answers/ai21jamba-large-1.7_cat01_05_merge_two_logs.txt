To merge the two event logs into a unified and enriched event log, we follow the steps below:

### **1. Load and Process Logs**

#### **Log A:**

This log will be treated as the primary timeline. Events are first sorted chronologically based on `timestamp`.

#### **Log B:**

This log provides richer details. A preliminary step is to standardize the event names to match those in Log A, where possible, and ensure timestamps are in a comparable format.

### **2. Match Events**

#### Criteria:

- **Order ID Match:** Only events with the same `order_id` will be considered for merging.
- **Timestamp Tolerance:** Events are considered the same if their timestamps differ by no more than **2 seconds**.
- **Event Name Alignment:** Event names are compared, allowing for some variation (e.g., "Order Received" vs. "OrderReceived").

### **3. Merge Attributes**

For matched events, we:

- Retain the `timestamp` from the more accurate system (Log A).
- Combine all attributes from Log B into the merged record.
- Document the event's source systems.

### **4. Handle Missing Events**

- If an event appears only in **Log A**, it is added as-is.
- If an event appears only in **Log B**, it is added with its full details.

### **5. Chronological Sorting**

The final list is sorted by the primary `timestamp`.

### **6. Document Decisions**

- **Timestamp Conflicts:** If timestamps differ slightly, we choose the earlier timestamp from Log A.
- **Event Name Variations:** Event names are adjusted to reflect the primary event names from Log A while noting the original name from Log B in metadata.
- **Unmatched Events:** These are added as-is, clearly marked to indicate their origin.

### **Merged Log (Final Output)**

**Timestamp**

**Event Name**

**Order ID**

**User ID**

**Resource ID**

Order#1234

u45

r10

Merged with "Shipping" from Log B. Primary timestamp retained, enriched metadata added.

2023-10-10T10:20:00Z

Item Delivered

Order#1234

None

None

No match in Log B. Included as-is.

2023-10-10T10:03:00Z

Quality Check

Order#1234

u45

r11

Exclusive to Log B. No corresponding event in Log A.

### **Explanation of Key Decisions**

1. **Timestamp Conflict Resolution:**
	- When timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds, the `timestamp` from Log A (the "primary" timeline) is preferred.
	- For large discrepancies or missing events, unmatched events are included separately.
2. **Event Name Standardization:**
	- Event names from Log A sont retained where possible, but names from Log B are documented as aliases for clarity.
3. **Unmatched Events:**
	- "Quality Check" from Log B has no match in Log A and is treated as a distinct event.
	- "Item Delivered" from Log A is unmatched in Log B and is included.

### **Final Log Format:**

- **Chronological order** ensures easier process analysis.
- **Combined attributes** provide richer detail for each event.
