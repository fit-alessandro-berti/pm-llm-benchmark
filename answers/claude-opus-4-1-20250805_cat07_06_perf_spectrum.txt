This visualization appears to be a Sankey diagram or flow chart showing the progression of financial actions over time, spanning from January 2000 to April 2013.

The diagram has three horizontal levels or stages:

1. **Top level: "Send Fine"** - This appears to be the initial action, represented by numerous gray vertical lines that flow downward.

2. **Middle level: "Insert Fine Notification"** - This is an intermediate step where the flows from "Send Fine" converge.

3. **Bottom level: "Send for Credit Collection"** - The final stage, where some portion of the notifications proceed to credit collection.

The most striking feature is the color coding:
- **Gray flows** represent the standard progression from sending fines to notifications
- **Red/pink flows** highlight the subset of cases that ultimately get sent for credit collection

The visualization effectively shows:
- The volume and frequency of fines being issued (density of vertical lines)
- The proportion of fines that escalate to credit collection (red flows vs. total flows)
- The temporal patterns over the 13-year period

The red highlighting makes it easy to track which initial fines eventually required credit collection action, suggesting this might be used to analyze collection rates, payment compliance, or the effectiveness of the fine notification system over time.
