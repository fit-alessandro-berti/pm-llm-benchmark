# Explanation of Logic

### Case Identification

1. **Document-Centric Cases**: Each document (Word, Excel, PDF) being worked on is a case. For example, all activities related to `Document1.docx` are grouped under a single case until there's a switch to another document. This ensures that the lifecycle of edits, saves, and closes for each document are captured in its entirety.
2. **Email Task as a Separate Case**: Email handling is considered a separate task or case. This case starts when the user switches from Word to Chrome and ends after sending the reply email.
3. **PDF Review as a Separate Case**: Reviewing the PDF in Adobe Acrobat and highlighting content is treated as a separate case, as it involves a different type of activity ( reviewing vs. editing or email handling).
4. **Budget Work as a Separate Case**: Similarly, editing the Excel spreadsheet is a separate case, representing the budget update task.

### Activity Naming

1. **Open/Close/Save Actions**: These are straightforward. For example, "SAVE" maps to "Save Document", and "CLOSE" maps to "Close Document".
2. **Typing and Editing**: The "TYPING" action is translated into more meaningful activities like "Edit Document", "Continue Editing Document", "Update Budget", "Modify Budget", "Reference Budgets", "Draft Reply", or "Edit Quarterly Report" based on the context of the document and typical user workflows.
3. **Switching Between Tasks**: Activities like "Switch to Quarterly Report" or "Check Email" indicate when the user shifts focus from one task to another, which is crucial for understanding task sequences and bottlenecks.
4. **Email Handling**: Tasks such as "Open Email", "Review Email", "Reply to Email", "Draft Reply", and "Send Email" are clearly named to reflect the stages of email interaction.
5. **PDF Reviewing**: Activities like "Review PDF", "Scroll Through PDF", and "Highlight in PDF" provide insight into the PDF examination process.

This transformed log creates a coherent narrative, enabling analysts to understand task sequences, identify where work frequently switches, and detect potential inefficiencies in the workflow.
