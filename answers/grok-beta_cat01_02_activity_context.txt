### Justification for Naming Choices:

- **Verify Documents**: Renamed to reflect the stage of verification. The initial verification checks basic documents, whereas the second is a re-verification after adjustments or additional submissions.
- **Call Customer**: Renamed to specify the purpose of the call, making it clear whether it's for requesting documents, clarifying details, or confirming actions.
- **Submit Additional**: This activity remains the same as it is specific to the customer's action of submitting documents post-verification request.
- **Adjust Account**: No change needed as it consistently refers to internal adjustments.
- **Approve Request**: Remains unchanged as it consistently marks the final approval step in each case.

This renaming provides clarity on the context and purpose of each activity within the workflow, allowing for better process analysis and improvement.
