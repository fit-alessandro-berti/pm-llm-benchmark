# Process Mining-Based Resource Assignment Optimization for TechSolve Solutions

As a Process Improvement Consultant specializing in IT Service Management (ITSM), I propose a comprehensive, data-driven strategy to optimize TechSolve Solutions’ incident management process using **process mining**. The goal is to improve **SLA compliance**, **reduce unnecessary escalations and reassignments**, and **better utilize agent skills**.

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### **1.1. Metrics for Performance and Behavior Analysis**

Using the event log data, we will analyze the behavior and performance of agents and support tiers through the following key metrics:

| Metric | Description | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Workload Distribution** | Tickets processed per agent/tier over time | Identify over/under-utilized agents or tiers |
| **Activity Processing Time** | Time between "Start" and "Complete" of each activity per agent/tier | Measure efficiency and identify delays |
| **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate (L1)** | % of tickets resolved at L1 without escalation | Assess L1 effectiveness and empowerment |
| **Escalation Rate** | % of tickets escalated from L1 to L2/L3 | Identify over-escalation or under-skilling at L1 |
| **Reassignment Frequency** | Number of reassignments per ticket | Highlight misrouting or skill mismatch |
| **Skill Utilization Rate** | Tickets handled vs. skills possessed per agent | Identify underutilized specialists or mismatched assignments |
| **Agent Availability** | Time between completing one ticket and starting the next | Assess agent responsiveness and resource allocation |

### **1.2. Process Mining Techniques to Reveal Assignment Patterns**

We will apply the following process mining techniques:

- **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**:
  - Map interactions between agents based on ticket handovers.
  - Identify frequently collaborating agents, siloed teams, and bottlenecks in knowledge transfer.

- **Resource Interaction Analysis**:
  - Visualize how tickets flow between agents and tiers.
  - Detect **circular routing** (tickets bouncing between agents) or **frequent reassignments**.

- **Role Discovery**:
  - Group agents by similar behavior (e.g., "escalators", "resolvers", "reassigners").
  - Compare these roles to formal tier responsibilities to detect deviations.

- **Variant Analysis**:
  - Compare process variants where tickets were resolved efficiently vs. those with multiple reassignments or SLA breaches.
  - Identify common patterns leading to inefficiencies.

### **1.3. Skill Utilization Analysis**

- **Skill Mapping**: Cross-reference each ticket’s **Required Skill** with the **Agent Skills** of the assigned agent.
- **Skill Gap Index**: For each agent, compute the ratio of tickets handled that matched their skills.
- **Skill Overlap Analysis**: Identify whether specialists (e.g., DB-SQL, IAM) are assigned tickets that could be handled by generalists.

**Insight Example**: If Agent B12 (App-CRM, DB-SQL) frequently resolves tickets requiring only App-CRM, we may be over-utilizing specialists on tasks that could be handled by L2 generalists.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### **2.1. Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies to Investigate**

| Bottleneck | Analysis Method | Evidence to Look For |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Skill Shortage** | Skill Gap Index | Tickets waiting for agents with specific skills |
| **Reassignment Delays** | Time between reassignment activities | Average time lost per reassignment |
| **Incorrect Initial Assignment** | FCR vs. Escalation Rate | High escalation rate despite L1 agent possessing required skills |
| **Overloaded Agents** | Workload Distribution | Agents with disproportionately high ticket volume |
| **SLA Breach Correlation** | SLA Breach vs. Reassignment/Escalation | Tickets with >2 reassignments are 3x more likely to breach SLA |

### **2.2. Quantification of Impact**

- **Average Delay per Reassignment**:  
  Calculate the average time between the **"Work L2 End"** and **"Assign L2"** of the next agent.  
  *Example*: 2.3 hours lost per reassignment.

- **Percentage of SLA Breaches Due to Reassignment**:  
  Filter all SLA breaches and check how many had 2 reassignments.  
  *Example*: 42% of P2 SLA breaches involved 2 reassignments.

- **Specialist Misuse**:  
  Calculate % of tickets handled by specialists that required only generalist skills.  
  *Example*: 35% of DB-SQL specialists’ tickets only required App-CRM or Basic-Troubleshoot.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### **3.1. Potential Root Causes**

| Cause | Evidence from Data |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Round-Robin Assignment Ignoring Skills** | High reassignment rate for tickets assigned to agents without matching skills |
| **Inaccurate Skill Profiles** | Tickets requiring a skill not listed in agent's profile |
| **Poor Ticket Categorization** | Tickets misclassified (e.g., Network  Software), leading to wrong assignment |
| **Lack of Real-Time Workload Visibility** | High workload agents still assigned new tickets |
| **Undertrained L1 Agents** | High L1 escalation rate despite tickets being resolvable at L1 |

### **3.2. Diagnostic Techniques**

- **Variant Analysis**:
  - Compare process variants with **smooth assignment** (1 assignment, 0 reassignments) vs. **chaotic variants** (multiple reassignments).
  - Identify common causes (e.g., skill mismatch, overloaded agent, incorrect initial category).

- **Decision Mining**:
  - Build decision trees based on assignment decisions (e.g., who got assigned, why).
  - Highlight whether decisions were based on skill, workload, or random.

- **Log Clustering**:
  - Cluster tickets by description or category and analyze assignment patterns.
  - Detect recurring misrouting for specific ticket types.

## 4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**

- **Issue Addressed**: Misrouting due to skill mismatch, overuse of specialists.
- **How It Leverages Process Mining**:
  - Uses historical data to map which agents have successfully resolved tickets with specific **Required Skills**.
  - Skill profiles are updated based on actual performance (e.g., tickets resolved vs. escalated).
- **Data Required**:
  - Ticket **Required Skill**
  - Agent **Skills and Proficiency Levels**
  - Historical resolution success rate per agent per skill
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - Reduced reassignment rate by 30–40%
  - Improved utilization of specialized agents
  - Faster resolution time due to better routing

### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**

- **Issue Addressed**: Overloaded agents, underutilized agents, lack of real-time visibility.
- **How It Leverages Process Mining**:
  - Analyzes real-time workload (e.g., active tickets, queue time, processing time) using event log data.
  - Prioritizes agents with available capacity and matching skills.
- **Data Required**:
  - Current agent workload (open tickets, average resolution time)
  - Ticket complexity (based on priority, category, required skill)
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - Evenly distributed workload across agents
  - Reduced queue time and faster assignment
  - Improved agent satisfaction

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Ticket Categorization and Skill Assignment**

- **Issue Addressed**: Inaccurate initial categorization, leading to misrouting.
- **How It Leverages Process Mining**:
  - Trains a machine learning model on historical ticket descriptions, categories, and required skills.
  - Predicts **ticket category and required skill** at creation time based on ticket description.
- **Data Required**:
  - Ticket description (text)
  - Historical mapping of descriptions to categories/skills
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - Reduced misrouting due to better initial categorization
  - Lower reassignment and escalation rate
  - Faster resolution through early correct assignment

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### **5.1. Simulation of Proposed Strategies**

We will use **business process simulation tools** (e.g., Celonis Simulation, ProcessGold, or custom-built models in Python) to:

- Model the current process using the mined process model.
- Apply the new assignment strategies in the simulation environment.
- Run thousands of tickets through the simulated system to:
  - Predict changes in SLA compliance
  - Measure average resolution time
  - Estimate reduction in reassignments and escalations

**Example**: Simulating the skill-based routing strategy could show a **20% reduction in P2 SLA breaches** and a **15% improvement in FCR**.

---

### **5.2. Monitoring Post-Implementation Using Process Mining Dashboards**

We will implement continuous monitoring using **real-time process mining dashboards** to track the following:

#### **Key Resource-Related KPIs**

| KPI | Description | Target |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| **First-Call Resolution Rate (L1)** | % of L1 tickets not escalated | 65% |
| **Average Reassignment Count per Ticket** | Average number of reassignments | 1 |
| **Average Assignment Delay** | Time from ticket creation to assignment | 10 mins |
| **SLA Compliance Rate** | % of tickets resolved within SLA | 95% (P1–P2), 90% (P3–P4) |
| **Skill Match Rate** | % of tickets assigned to agents with matching skills | 85% |
| **Agent Utilization Index** | % of agent working time vs. total available time | Balanced across agents |

#### **Process Views to Monitor Continuously**

1. **Agent Workload Heatmap**: Visualize agent load in real time.
2. **Skill Utilization Matrix**: Track usage of each skill across tiers.
3. **Assignment Flow Diagram**: Show how tickets flow between agents and tiers.
4. **Reassignment Path Analysis**: Identify recurring reassignment paths.
5. **SLA Breach Root Cause Dashboard**: Correlate breaches with reassignments, skill mismatches, or agent overload.
