### Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **R (Receive) to P (Approve):** The average time of approximately 25 hours between receiving a claim and its approval has an unusually low standard deviation, indicating that the timing is highly consistent but may be artificially rigid.
   
2. **P (Approve) to N (Notify):** There's a long average delay of 7 days followed by a high standard deviation of 2 days between approving a claim and notifying the customer, suggesting variability in processing times.

3. **A (Assign) to C (Close):** A quick closure time of about 2 hours after assigning an adjuster without intermediate evaluations or approvals might indicate claims being prematurely closed.
   
4. **E (Evaluate) to N (Notify):** The short average transition time of just 5 minutes between evaluating a claim and notifying the customer suggests either extremely rapid processing or potentially skipping necessary steps.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - A highly controlled process that may involve strict deadlines or automated systems that enforce specific timing.
   
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - Systemic delays due to human intervention, such as waiting for approval from supervisors or managers.
   - Backlogs during holidays or weekends when adjusters are unavailable.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - Errors in logging events leading to the omission of necessary intermediate activities like evaluation and approval steps.
   - Some claims might be automatically closed due to lack of actionable information.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - Automated systems skipping intermediary checks or notifications for certain types of claims.
   - Adjusters making quick decisions without further evaluations, perhaps in cases where the claim's validity is clear-cut.

### Verification Queries

To address these hypotheses and verify if they hold true in practice, we can construct SQL queries as follows:

1. **Identify Claims with Abnormally Short or Long Times Between R to P:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) / 3600 AS time_hours
   FROM claim_events ce
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   WHERE ce.timestamp < ce2.timestamp;
   ```

   This query calculates the time in hours between receiving and approving claims to identify outliers.

2. **Find Claims with Excessive Delay Between P to N:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) / 86400 AS days_waiting
   FROM claim_events ce
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE ce.timestamp < ce2.timestamp;
   ```

   Identifies claims where the delay between approval and notification is particularly long.

3. **Claims Closed Too Quickly After Assignment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) / 3600 AS time_hours
   FROM claim_events ce
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   WHERE ce.timestamp < ce2.timestamp;
   ```

   Filters claims closed within an unusually short time frame after assignment.

4. **Quick Transitions Between Evaluation and Notification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.claim_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) / 60 AS minutes_waiting
   FROM claim_events ce
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE ce.timestamp < ce2.timestamp;
   ```

   Identifies claims with abnormally fast transitions between evaluation and notification, which might indicate skipped steps.

By analyzing the results of these queries, we can better understand if there are specific conditions or patterns that correlate with the identified anomalies.
