**Business Process Explanation**
================================

The pseudo-BPMN representation depicts a business process for managing customer requests, which can be either standard or custom. The process involves various tasks, gateways, and paths that converge or loop back based on certain conditions.

### Process Overview

1. The process starts with receiving a customer request (`Task A: "Receive Customer Request"`).
2. The request type is checked (`Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type`), and the process diverges into either a standard or custom path.
3. The process converges after completing the tasks in either path and then checks if approval is needed (`Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"`).
4. Based on the approval requirement, the process either generates a final invoice (`Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"`) or obtains manager approval (`Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"`).
5. The process ends with sending a confirmation to the customer (`Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"`).

### Standard Path

*   If the request type is standard (`If Type = Standard`):
    1.  Perform standard validation (`Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"`).
    2.  Run parallel checks (`Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"`):
        *   Credit check (`Task C1: "Credit Check"`).
        *   Inventory check (`Task C2: "Inventory Check"`).
    3.  Once both checks are completed, calculate the delivery date (`Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"`).

### Custom Path

*   If the request type is custom (`If Type = Custom`):
    1.  Perform custom feasibility analysis (`Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"`).
    2.  Check if customization is feasible (`Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"`):
        *   If feasible, prepare a custom quotation (`Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"`).
        *   If not feasible, send a rejection notice (`Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"`).

### Convergence and Looping

*   After completing the tasks in either the standard or custom path, the process converges and checks if approval is needed (`Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"`).
*   If approval is needed and granted (`Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"` and `Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"`), the process generates a final invoice (`Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"`).
*   If approval is needed but not granted, the process re-evaluates conditions (`Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"`). Depending on the original request type, it loops back to either `Task E1` (for custom path) or `Task D` (for standard path).

### Task Differences

*   The main difference between the standard and custom paths lies in the tasks performed:
    *   Standard path involves standard validation, credit and inventory checks, and delivery date calculation.
    *   Custom path involves custom feasibility analysis, preparation of a custom quotation (if feasible), or sending a rejection notice (if not feasible).

### Approval and Rework Conditions

*   Approval is required under certain conditions (`Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"`).
*   If approval is needed, the process obtains manager approval (`Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"`).
*   Rework is triggered if approval is not granted (`Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"` and `Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"`), causing the process to loop back to a previous task based on the original request type.

In summary, the business process handles customer requests by diverging into standard or custom paths based on the request type. The process involves various tasks, gateways, and paths that converge or loop back based on certain conditions, ensuring that approvals are obtained and rework is performed as necessary.
