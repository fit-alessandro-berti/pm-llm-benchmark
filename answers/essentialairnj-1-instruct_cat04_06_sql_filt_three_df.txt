To solve this problem, we need to write a SQL query to first identify the cases that contain the specific sequence of activities and then filter them based on the time difference between "Create Order" and "Confirm Order". After excluding these cases, we will include all the events that do not belong to these cases.

Here's how the query can be written in DuckDB:

```python
import duckdb

# Initiating a DuckDB connection
con = duckdb.connect()

# Assume you are using a function that returns the query result for use in further operations
query = """
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(timestamp) AS start_timestamp,
        MAX(timestamp) AS end_timestamp,
        MIN(activity) AS first_activity,
        MAX(activity) AS last_activity
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            SUM(ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id, activity ORDER BY timestamp)) 
                - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
        FROM event_log
        ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
    )
    GROUP BY case_id, seq_num
    HAVING first_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND last_activity = 'Confirm Order' AND
        last_activity = any(value FROM unnest(array[
            (1, 'Approve Purchase Requisition'),
            (2, (select activity from (select case_id, timestamp, sum(ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by case_id, activity order by timestamp)) - row_number() over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as seq_num from event_log order by case_id, timestamp) hist where case_id = hist.case_id and seq_num = 2 limit 1)),
            (3, (select activity from (select case_id, timestamp, sum(ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by case_id, activity order by timestamp)) - row_number() over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) as seq_num from event_log order by case_id, timestamp) hist where case_id = hist.case_id and seq_num = 3 limit 1))
        ])) AND seq_num <= 3
),

filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE end_timestamp - start_timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
),

filtered_event_log AS (
    SELECT * FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases)
)

SELECT * FROM filtered_event_log
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
"""

# Interpret the query using DuckDB, this line will execute the query and fetch you your final result
result = con.execute(query).fetch_df()
print(result)
```

**Explanation:**
- The first CTE `case_sequences` finds the subsequences of activities within the same case that match the pattern 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' and collects their start and end timestamps.
- The second CTE `filtered_cases` selects the unique `case_id`s from `case_sequences` where the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events is more than 5 days.
- The third CTE `filtered_event_log` excludes all the events belonging to cases that match the criteria mentioned.
- The final query returns the filtered event log.

Please note that the query above is written to function as a SQL query executed in DuckDB. It assumes that the data is loaded into the `event_log` table in the DuckDB context.
