### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

#### Performance and Behavior Analysis:
To analyze the performance and behavior of individual agents and support tiers, we can focus on the following metrics:

- **Workload Distribution:** Assess the number of tickets handled by each agent and tier to identify overloaded or underutilized agents.
- **Activity Processing Times:** Measure the average time taken by agents to complete tasks at each tier.
- **First-Call Resolution Rate for L1:** Track the percentage of tickets resolved by L1 agents without escalation.
- **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills:** Analyze how often agents handle tickets requiring specific skills to determine if skills are being utilized effectively.

#### Process Mining Techniques:
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Visualize handovers between agents to understand interaction patterns and identify frequent reassignments.
- **Social Network Analysis:** Use handover data to create a social network of agents, highlighting key players and potential bottlenecks.
- **Role Discovery:** Identify emergent roles based on actual ticket handling patterns, which may differ from documented roles.

#### Skill Utilization Analysis:
- **Skill Matching:** Compare the skills required for each ticket with the assigned agent's skills. Identify instances where highly skilled agents are handling simpler tasks.
- **Skill Frequency:** Track the frequency of each skill being utilized and compare it with the available skills in the agent pool.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

#### Resource-Related Problems:
- **Bottlenecks:** Identify agents with specific skills who have high queue lengths and long resolution times.
- **Reassignments and Escalations:** Measure the frequency of reassignments and escalations. Pinpoint agents or ticket categories with high reassignment rates.
- **Initial Assignment Errors:** Analyze tickets that were incorrectly assigned initially and required escalation.
- **Underperforming/Overloaded Agents:** Use workload distribution metrics to identify agents with consistently high or low performance.
- **SLA Breaches:** Correlate SLA breaches with resource assignment patterns to identify if specific agents or skill mismatches contribute to delays.

#### Quantifying Impact:
- **Average Delay per Reassignment:** Calculate the average delay caused by each reassignment.
- **SLA Breaches Linked to Skill Mismatch:** Determine the percentage of SLA breaches that can be attributed to incorrect skill assignments.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

#### Potential Root Causes:
- **Assignment Rules Deficiencies:** Round-robin assignment may not consider skills or workload.
- **Inaccurate Skill Profiles:** Agent skill profiles may be outdated or incomplete.
- **Poor Ticket Categorization:** Incorrect initial categorization can lead to poor assignments.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Absence of real-time workload and availability data can cause inefficient assignments.
- **Insufficient Training:** L1 agents may lack the training needed to handle more complex issues, leading to excessive escalations.

#### Advanced Analysis Techniques:
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare cases with smooth assignments against those with many reassignments to identify common factors.
- **Decision Mining:** Analyze decision points to understand the criteria used for escalations and reassignments.

### 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

#### Business Process Simulation:
- **Evaluation:** Use process mining models to simulate the impact of new assignment strategies. Assess potential improvements in resolution times, reassignments, and SLA compliance.
- **Data Input:** Use historical event log data to inform simulations.

#### Monitoring Plan:
- **Process Mining Dashboards:** Create dashboards to continuously monitor key resource-related KPIs such as:
  - Average resolution time per agent/tier.
  - First-call resolution rate.
  - Frequency of reassignments and escalations.
  - Workload distribution across agents.
  - SLA compliance rates.

- **Key Process Views:**
  - Resource interaction maps to track handovers.
  - Social network analysis to monitor agent collaboration.
  - Skill utilization reports to ensure effective use of specialized skills.
