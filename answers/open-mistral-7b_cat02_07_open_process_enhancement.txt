Process mining is a data-driven approach to understand, analyze, and improve business processes. It leverages event logs, which are collections of data about the execution of business processes, to uncover insights and identify areas for improvement. Three main techniques in process mining are process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement.

Process Discovery:
Process discovery is the technique of identifying the underlying process model from event logs. The primary goal is to create a visual representation of the process, showing the sequence of activities, decision points, and their frequencies. This helps organizations to understand how a process is actually executed compared to the intended design.

Conformance Checking:
Conformance checking is the evaluation of how well an event log adheres to a given process model. It assesses if the recorded events in the log conform to the rules defined in the model, providing insights into deviations and exceptions. This technique helps organizations to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and deviations from the process, enabling them to make improvements.

Process Enhancement:
Process enhancement is a more advanced technique that builds upon process discovery and conformance checking. It aims to optimize or redesign processes by leveraging insights from both process discovery and conformance checking. This involves identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and deviations in the process and proposing improvements, such as reorganizing activities, automating tasks, or modifying the process flow.

Process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking in that it goes beyond just understanding and evaluating the process. Instead, it focuses on actively improving the process based on the insights gained, resulting in a more efficient, effective, and compliant workflow.
