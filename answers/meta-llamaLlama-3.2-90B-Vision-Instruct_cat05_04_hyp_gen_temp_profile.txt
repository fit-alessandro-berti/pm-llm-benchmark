### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

Upon reviewing the temporal profile model, the following anomalies stand out:

- **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: The average time is ~25 hours with a very low standard deviation, suggesting an unnaturally consistent approval schedule.
- **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: A 7-day average delay with a high standard deviation indicates inconsistent notification timing.
- **A to C (Assign to Close)**: Claims are often closed just 2 hours after assignment, suggesting potential premature closure or skipped steps.
- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: The 5-minute average between evaluation and notification seems unrealistically short, possibly indicating skipped steps or overly rapid processing.

### Hypotheses on the Existence of Anomalies

- **Systemic delays:** Manual data entry might cause delays between approval and notification.
- **Automated rapid steps:** Automated evaluation and notification processes might be set up to trigger too quickly, leading to skipped checks.
- **Resource bottlenecks:** Limited adjuster availability could cause claims to queue, leading to extended evaluation and approval phases.
- **Inconsistent resource allocation:** Different adjusters or regions might manage claims differently, affecting process timing.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

To investigate these anomalies, consider the following SQL queries:

#### 1. Claims with unusually short or long activity intervals

```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
FROM 
    claim_events
WHERE 
    (activity = 'R' AND next_activity = 'P' AND next_timestamp - timestamp > INTERVAL '25 hours')
    OR (activity = 'P' AND next_activity = 'N' AND next_timestamp - timestamp > INTERVAL '9 days')
    OR (activity = 'A' AND next_activity = 'C' AND next_timestamp - timestamp < INTERVAL '2 hours')
    OR (activity = 'E' AND next_activity = 'N' AND next_timestamp - timestamp < INTERVAL '30 minutes');
```

#### 2. Adjuster or claim-type specific time intervals

```sql
SELECT 
    ce.claim_id,
    a.adjuster_id,
    c.claim_type,
    ce.activity,
    ce.timestamp,
    LEAD(ce.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity,
    LEAD(ce.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_timestamp
FROM 
    claim_events ce
    JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id
WHERE 
    (ce.activity = 'R' AND LEAD(ce.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) = 'P')
    OR (ce.activity = 'P' AND LEAD(ce.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) = 'N')
    OR (ce.activity = 'A' AND LEAD(ce.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) = 'C')
    OR (ce.activity = 'E' AND LEAD(ce.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) = 'N');
```

#### 3. Claims closed immediately after assignment

```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    adjuster_id,
    claim_type,
    MIN(timestamp) AS assignment_time,
    MAX(timestamp) AS close_time,
    MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS close_time_diff
FROM 
    claim_events
JOIN 
    claims ON claim_events.claim_id = claims.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters ON resource = adjuster_id
WHERE 
    activity = 'A' AND 'C' IN (SELECT activity FROM claim_events)
GROUP BY 
    claim_id, adjuster_id, claim_type
HAVING 
    MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) < INTERVAL '2 hours';
```

#### 4. Long approval to notification delays

```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    adjuster_id,
    claim_type,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approval_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notification_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approval_notification_diff
FROM 
    claim_events
JOIN 
    claims ON claim_events.claim_id = claims.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters ON resource = adjuster_id
WHERE 
    'P' IN (SELECT activity FROM claim_events) AND 'N' IN (SELECT activity FROM claim_events)
GROUP BY 
    claim_id, adjuster_id, claim_type
HAVING 
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) > INTERVAL '9 days';
```
