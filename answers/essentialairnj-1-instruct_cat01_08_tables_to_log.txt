Here is the step-by-step solution to transform the data into an event log suitable for process mining, followed by the markdown table output:

### 1. **Identify Cases**  
   Use `order_id` as the case identifier.

### 2. **Derive Activities**  
   Convert key steps in the lifecycle of each order into events.
   
### 3. **Map Timestamps**  
   Ensure timestamps are in chronological order. If multiple timestamps exist, it should map to a single event or aggregate if meaningful.
   
### 4. **Combine Data**  
   Link each event using the keys provided. Ensure that the chronological order reflects the real process flow.
   
### 5. **Enrich with Resources and Attributes**  
   If the tables contain information about which department or user performed the activity, include a "Resource" or "Actor" column.
