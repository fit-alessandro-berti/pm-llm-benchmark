**Analysis and Renaming of Activities:**

Here's a breakdown of the activities and their renaming, along with justifications:

1.  **Initiate Request:** This activity appears consistently at the beginning of each case and represents the initial point of customer interaction to start a request. No need for renaming.

2.  **Verify Documents:** This activity appears multiple times and has different meanings based on its context.

    *   Initial verification of customer identity/documents.
    *   Re-verification of the documents after the customer has updated them or other information changes.

    **Rename:**
    *   `Verify Documents (Initial)`
    *   `Verify Documents (Recheck)`
    **Justification:** The additional context indicates that this activity occurs at different stages of the case, and depending on that stage, a recheck is required. Adding the additional context to the action makes this more meaningful.

3.  **Call Customer:** This activity has two distinct roles:

    *   Calling a customer to get missing documents.
    *   Calling a customer to discuss adjustments.
    *   Calling a customer to have them return to the branch.

    **Rename:**
    *   `Call Customer (Request Missing Docs)`
    *   `Call Customer (Clarify Account)`
    *   `Call Customer (Return to Branch)`

    **Justification:** The context clarifies what the call is for, be it for additional information or to resolve an issue, or to ask the customer to return to the branch.

4.  **Submit Additional:** This activity represents the submission of additional documents by the customer.

    **Rename:** No change needed.

5.  **Adjust Account:** This activity occurs internally to adjust account information.

    **Rename:** No change needed.

6.  **Approve Request:** This activity represents the final approval of the request.

    **Rename:** No change needed.
