Based on the provided process variants, I will generate a Log Skeleton model using the constraints you provided.

Here is the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton model:
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # empty set for equivalence constraints
    'always_before': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'),
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'),
        ('Create Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
        ('Create Fine', 'Add penalty'),
        ('Create Fine', 'Send for Credit Collection'),
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
        ('Send Fine', 'Payment'),
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'),
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'),
        ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'),
        ('Payment', 'Send Fine'),
        ('Payment', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Add penalty'),
        ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'),
        ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Payment'),
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Send for Credit Collection'),
        ('Add penalty', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'),

Note that I have not used some of the `never_together` constraints as they are not applicable to the given process variants.

Please note that this is a generated Log Skeleton model based on the constraints provided, and it may not be perfect or complete. You may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements and process variants.
