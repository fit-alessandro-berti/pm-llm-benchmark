## Temporal Profile Analysis

### Identified Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve): ~25 hours with extremely low STDEV (1 hour)**
   - The rigid timing suggests an artificial constraint or automated approval process
   - Standard deviation is unusually small for a human-driven approval process

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify): 7 days average with high STDEV (2 days)**
   - Excessive delay between approval and customer notification
   - High variability suggests inconsistent handling

3. **A to C (Assign to Close): 2 hours average**
   - Suspiciously quick closure after assignment
   - May indicate claims being closed without proper evaluation

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify): 5 minutes average**
   - Unrealistically fast transition
   - Suggests automated notification or missing intermediate steps

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Automated Approval System**: The RP timing might indicate an automated pre-approval system for certain claim types or amounts, with manual override causing the small variance.

2. **Notification Backlog**: The PN delay could result from:
   - Batch processing of notifications (weekly runs)
   - Resource constraints in the notification department
   - System integration issues between approval and notification systems

3. **Premature Closures**: Quick AC transitions might indicate:
   - Duplicate claims being immediately closed
   - Claims rejected for missing documentation
   - Fraudulent claims flagged by the system

4. **Auto-notification on Evaluation**: The EN speed suggests evaluation results trigger immediate automated notifications for certain outcomes.

### SQL Verification Queries

#### 1. Analyze RP timing anomalies
```sql
WITH claim_timings AS (
  SELECT 
    r.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) as receive_to_approve_seconds
  FROM claim_events r
  JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
  JOIN claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
  WHERE r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
  claim_type,
  COUNT(*) as claim_count,
  AVG(receive_to_approve_seconds)/3600 as avg_hours,
  STDDEV(receive_to_approve_seconds)/3600 as stddev_hours,
  MIN(receive_to_approve_seconds)/3600 as min_hours,
  MAX(receive_to_approve_seconds)/3600 as max_hours
FROM claim_timings
GROUP BY claim_type
ORDER BY avg_hours;
```

#### 2. Investigate PN delays by resource and region
```sql
WITH approval_notification_gap AS (
  SELECT 
    p.claim_id,
    p.resource as approver,
    n.resource as notifier,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))/86400 as days_to_notify,
    c.claim_amount,
    adj.region
  FROM claim_events p
  JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
  JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
  LEFT JOIN adjusters adj ON p.resource = adj.name
  WHERE p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
  region,
  COUNT(*) as total_claims,
  AVG(days_to_notify) as avg_days,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY days_to_notify) as median_days,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN days_to_notify > 10 THEN 1 END) as extreme_delays
FROM approval_notification_gap
GROUP BY region
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY avg_days DESC;
```

#### 3. Identify suspiciously quick AC closures
```sql
WITH quick_closures AS (
  SELECT 
    a.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    a.resource as adjuster,
    cl.resource as closer,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.timestamp - a.timestamp))/3600 as hours_to_close,
    cl.additional_info
  FROM claim_events a
  JOIN claim_events cl ON a.claim_id = cl.claim_id
  JOIN claims c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
  WHERE a.activity = 'A' AND cl.activity = 'C'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < 7200  -- Less than 2 hours
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  claim_type,
  claim_amount,
  adjuster,
  hours_to_close,
  additional_info
FROM quick_closures
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e 
  WHERE e.claim_id = quick_closures.claim_id 
    AND e.activity IN ('E', 'P')
    AND e.timestamp BETWEEN (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = quick_closures.claim_id AND activity = 'A')
                        AND (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = quick_closures.claim_id AND activity = 'C')
)
ORDER BY hours_to_close;
```

#### 4. Examine EN rapid transitions
```sql
WITH eval_notify_times AS (
  SELECT 
    e.claim_id,
    e.resource as evaluator,
    n.resource as notifier,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) as seconds_to_notify,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    e.additional_info as eval_info,
    n.additional_info as notify_info
  FROM claim_events e
  JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
  JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
  WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND n.timestamp > e.timestamp
)
SELECT 
  claim_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(seconds_to_notify)/60 as avg_minutes,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN seconds_to_notify < 300 THEN 1 END) as under_5_min,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN evaluator = notifier THEN 1 END) as same_resource
FROM eval_notify_times
GROUP BY claim_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY avg_minutes;
```

#### 5. Overall process conformance check
```sql
WITH process_paths AS (
  SELECT 
    claim_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '' ORDER BY timestamp) as path,
    COUNT(*) as step_count
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
  path,
  COUNT(*) as frequency,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM process_paths
GROUP BY path
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

These queries will help identify specific instances of timing anomalies, correlate them with business attributes, and understand whether certain patterns are systematic or isolated incidents.
