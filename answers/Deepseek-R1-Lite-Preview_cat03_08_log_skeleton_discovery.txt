### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Identify All Activities:**
   - Gather all unique activities from the process variants.
   - Activities: `Create Fine`, `Send Fine`, `Insert Fine Notification`, `Add penalty`, `Send for Credit Collection`, `Payment`, `Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture`, `Send Appeal to Prefecture`, `Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`, `Notify Result Appeal to Offender`, `Appeal to Judge`.

2. **Determine Equivalence Constraints:**
   - Equivalence means two activities occur the same number of times whenever they appear.
   - From the variants, no two distinct activities always occur with the same frequency except possibly some pairs like `Send Appeal to Prefecture` and `Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`, but they don't always have the same occurrences.
   - Therefore, only self-equivalence exists.
   - **Equivalence:** `{('Create Fine', 'Create Fine'), ('Send Fine', 'Send Fine'), ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Insert Fine Notification'), ('Add penalty', 'Add penalty'), ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Payment', 'Payment'), ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'), ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'), ('Appeal to Judge', 'Appeal to Judge')}`

3. **Determine Always Before Constraints:**
   - Activities that, when they occur, are always preceded by another specific activity.
   - For example:
     - `Send Fine` always occurs after `Create Fine`.
     - `Insert Fine Notification` always occurs after `Send Fine`.
     - `Add penalty` always occurs after `Insert Fine Notification`.
   - **Always Before:** `{('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'), ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'), ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'), ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Add penalty', 'Payment'), ('Add penalty', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'), ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'), ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Payment'), ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Appeal to Judge'), ('Add penalty', 'Appeal to Judge'), ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Add penalty', 'Payment')}`

4. **Determine Always After Constraints:**
   - The reverse of always_before.
   - For example:
     - `Create Fine` is always before `Send Fine`.
     - `Send Fine` is always before `Insert Fine Notification`.
   - **Always After:** `{('Send Fine', 'Create Fine'), ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Send Fine'), ('Add penalty', 'Insert Fine Notification'), ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Add penalty'), ('Payment', 'Add penalty'), ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Add penalty'), ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'), ('Payment', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'), ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'), ('Appeal to Judge', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'), ('Appeal to Judge', 'Add penalty'), ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Add penalty'), ('Payment', 'Add penalty')}`

5. **Determine Never Together Constraints:**
   - Activities that never co-occur in the same case.
   - From the variants, `Send for Credit Collection` and `Payment` do co-occur in some cases, so they are not never_together.
   - Similarly, `Appeal to Judge` and `Payment` co-occur.
   - There are no activities that never appear together.
   - **Never Together:** `{}`

6. **Determine Activity Occurrences:**
   - Identify the possible number of times each activity can occur in a case.
   - From the variants:
     - `Create Fine`: always occurs once `{1}`
     - `Send Fine`: occurs once or twice in some variants `{1, 2}`
     - `Insert Fine Notification`: occurs once or not at all in some variants `{0, 1}`
     - `Add penalty`: occurs once or twice `{1, 2}`
     - `Send for Credit Collection`: occurs once `{1}`
     - `Payment`: occurs once, twice, thrice, or four times `{1, 2, 3, 4}`
     - `Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture`: occurs once `{1}`
     - `Send Appeal to Prefecture`: occurs once `{1}`
     - `Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`: occurs once `{1}`
     - `Notify Result Appeal to Offender`: occurs once `{1}`
     - `Appeal to Judge`: occurs once or twice `{1, 2}`
   - **Activity Occurrences:** `{'Create Fine': {1}, 'Send Fine': {1, 2}, 'Insert Fine Notification': {0, 1}, 'Add penalty': {1, 2}, 'Send for Credit Collection': {1}, 'Payment': {1, 2, 3, 4}, 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {1}, 'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {1}, 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {1}, 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {1}, 'Appeal to Judge': {1, 2}}`

7. **Determine Directly Follows Constraints:**
   - Identify pairs of activities that always follow one another directly when they occur in sequence.
   - For example:
     - `Create Fine` directly follows nothing or is the start activity.
     - `Send Fine` directly follows `Create Fine`.
     - `Insert Fine Notification` directly follows `Send Fine`.
   - **Directly Follows:** `{('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'), ('Create Fine', 'Payment'), ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'), ('Send Fine', 'Payment'), ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'), ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Payment'), ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Add penalty', 'Payment'), ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Add penalty', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'), ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'), ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'), ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Add penalty'), ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Payment'), ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Appeal to Judge'), ('Payment', 'Payment'), ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Appeal to Judge', 'Payment'), ('Appeal to Judge', 'Send for Credit Collection'), ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'), ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'), ('Send Fine', 'Payment')}`
