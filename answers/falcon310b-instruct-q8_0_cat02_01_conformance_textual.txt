To solve this task, we need to compare each case in the event log against the normative process description provided. We'll look for deviations from the specified flow and conditions:

1. **Case 1:**
   - Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close.
   - This case follows the expected flow exactly when inventory is sufficient. No violations are detected.

2. **Case 2:**
   - Sequence: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize Payment, Ship, Close.
   - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the normative process, payment should be authorized after checking inventory and before packaging. This is a clear violation.

3. **Case 3:**
   - Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Cancel, Ship, Close.
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order." Once an order is canceled, it's illogical to proceed with shipping. This violates the normative process description.

4. **Case 4:**
   - Sequence: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.
   - This case follows the expected flow for insufficient inventory scenarios. No violations are detected.

5. **Case 5:**
   - Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Ship, Close.
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs directly after "Authorize payment" without "Package items" in between. According to the normative process, items must be packaged before they can be shipped. This is a violation.

**Summary of Violations:**
- **Case 2:** Violation: Packaging before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3:** Violation: Shipping after cancellation.
- **Case 5:** Violation: Shipping without prior packaging.

**Cases 1 and 4** do not violate the normative process and are compliant with the described workflow.

Final Answer: The final answer is that Cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process. Case 2 violates by packaging before authorizing payment, Case 3 violates by shipping after cancellation, and Case 5 violates by shipping without prior packaging. I hope it is correct.
