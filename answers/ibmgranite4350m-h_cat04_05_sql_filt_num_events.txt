Certainly! Below is a DuckDB SQL query that filters out any `case_id`s containing more than six events in total from an event log stored in the table named `event_log`. The query ensures that only cases with six or fewer events are returned.

```sql
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
) AS per_case
WHERE 
    event_count <= 6;
```

This query does the following:

1. It selects from an intermediate result set that groups events by `case_id` and counts them.
2. The subquery is aliased as `per_case`.
3. The outer query then filters this grouped data to include only those rows where the event count (counted in step 1) is less than or equal to six.

This approach effectively removes any cases with more than six events, leaving you with a list of cases that have been analyzed for one process instance each.
