To construct the DECLARE model for the given product design and launch process, we define constraints based on the required sequence and dependencies of activities. The model ensures all activities occur at least once, starts with "Idea Generation (IG)", and maintains the specified order using succession constraints.

```python
DECLARE_model = {
    # Unary constraints (single activities)
    'existence': {
        'IG': (1.0, 1.0),   # Idea Generation must occur
        'DD': (1.0, 1.0),   # Design Draft must occur
        'TFC': (1.0, 1.0),  # Technical Feasibility Check must occur
        'CE': (1.0, 1.0),   # Cost Evaluation must occur
        'PC': (1.0, 1.0),   # Prototype Creation must occur
        'LT': (1.0, 1.0),   # Laboratory Testing must occur
        'UT': (1.0, 1.0),   # User Testing must occur
        'AG': (1.0, 1.0),   # Approval Gate must occur
        'MP': (1.0, 1.0),   # Marketing Plan must occur
        'FL': (1.0, 1.0)    # Final Launch must occur
    },
    'absence': {},           # No activities are forbidden
    'exactly_one': {},       # No activities restricted to exactly one occurrence
    'init': {
        'IG': (1.0, 1.0)    # Process must start with Idea Generation
    },
    
    # Binary constraints (activity pairs)
    'responded_existence': {},
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {},
    'precedence': {},
    'succession': {
        ('IG', 'DD'): (1.0, 1.0),  # IG must be followed by DD
        ('DD', 'TFC'): (1.0, 1.0), # DD must be followed by TFC
        ('DD', 'CE'): (1.0, 1.0),  # DD must be followed by CE
        ('TFC', 'PC'): (1.0, 1.0), # TFC must be followed by PC
        ('CE', 'PC'): (1.0, 1.0),  # CE must be followed by PC
        ('PC', 'LT'): (1.0, 1.0),  # PC must be followed by LT
        ('PC', 'UT'): (1.0, 1.0),  # PC must be followed by UT
        ('LT', 'AG'): (1.0, 1.0),  # LT must be followed by AG
        ('UT', 'AG'): (1.0, 1.0),  # UT must be followed by AG
        ('AG', 'MP'): (1.0, 1.0),  # AG must be followed by MP
        ('MP', 'FL'): (1.0, 1.0)   # MP must be followed by FL
    },
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {},
    'chainprecedence': {},
    'chainsuccession': {},
    'noncoexistence': {},
    'nonsuccession': {},
    'nonchainsuccession': {}
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Unary Constraints**:
   - **existence**: Ensures all activities (IG, DD, TFC, CE, PC, LT, UT, AG, MP, FL) occur at least once.
   - **init**: Specifies the process must start with "Idea Generation (IG)".

2. **Binary Constraints**:
   - **succession**: Enforces the required order between activities:
     - IG  DD (Idea Generation precedes Design Draft).
     - DD  TFC and DD  CE (Design Draft precedes both Technical Feasibility Check and Cost Evaluation).
     - TFC  PC and CE  PC (Both Technical Feasibility Check and Cost Evaluation must precede Prototype Creation).
     - PC  LT and PC  UT (Prototype Creation precedes both Laboratory Testing and User Testing).
     - LT  AG and UT  AG (Both Laboratory Testing and User Testing must precede Approval Gate).
     - AG  MP (Approval Gate precedes Marketing Plan).
     - MP  FL (Marketing Plan precedes Final Launch).

3. **Unused Constraints**: All other constraint types (e.g., absence, coexistence, response) are left empty as they are not required for this scenario.

This model captures the core workflow of the product design and launch process, ensuring activities occur in the correct sequence while allowing flexibility in the order of parallel tasks (e.g., TFC/CE and LT/UT).
