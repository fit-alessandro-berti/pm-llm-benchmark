 Based on the process variants you provided, I can suggest a DECLARE model with the following constraints:

1. Existence constraints:
	* 'Create Fine': with support and confidence set to 1.0, as it is always the first activity in the process.
2. Initialization constraint:
	* 'Create Fine': specifying that the trace starts with this activity, with support and confidence set to 1.0.
3. Responded Existence constraints:
	* ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): since 'Send Fine' always follows 'Create Fine'.
	* ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): since 'Payment' can occur after 'Create Fine' without 'Send Fine'.
4. Exclusivity constraints:
	* ('Create Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): specifying that 'Insert Fine Notification' should not occur without 'Send Fine' preceding it.
5. Response constraints:
	* ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): since 'Insert Fine Notification' always follows 'Send Fine'.
	* ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add Penalty'): since 'Add Penalty' always follows 'Insert Fine Notification'.
	* ('Add Penalty', 'Payment/Send for Credit Collection'): depending on the situation, 'Payment' or 'Send for Credit Collection' follows 'Add Penalty'.
6. Non Co-Existence constraints:
	* ('Payment', 'Send for Credit Collection'): indicating that these activities should not occur in the same trace.

Please note that the above is a simplified DECLARE model based on the process variants provided. You may want to extend or modify it according to your specific requirements or further analyze the process to add more constraints.

To express this model as a Python dictionary, following the format you provided:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Add Penalty
