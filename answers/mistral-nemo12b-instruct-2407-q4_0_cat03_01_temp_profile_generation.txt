Here's a hypothetical temporal profile for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process with activities like 'Request', 'Approve', 'Purchase', 'Receive', and 'Pay'. I've assumed average times and standard deviations based on typical business processes.

```python
p2p_temporal_profile = {
    ('Request', 'Approve'): (43200, 7200),  # Average: 12 hours, Standard deviation: 2 hours
    ('Approve', 'Purchase'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, Standard deviation: 4 hours
    ('Purchase', 'Receive'): (360000, 57600),  # Average: 4 days, Standard deviation: 16 hours
    ('Receive', 'Pay'): (86400, 28800),  # Average: 1 day, Standard deviation: 8 hours
    ('Approve', 'Receive'): (378000, 58320),  # Average: 4.5 days, Standard deviation: 16 hours
    ('Purchase', 'Pay'): (604800, 97200),  # Average: 7 days, Standard deviation: 24 hours
}
```

In this profile:

- The average time between 'Request' and 'Approve' is 12 hours with a standard deviation of 2 hours.
- The average time between 'Purchase' and 'Receive' is 4 days (360,000 seconds) with a standard deviation of 16 hours (57,600 seconds).
- And so on for other activity pairs.

You can adjust these values to fit your specific process or use them as a starting point.
