Based on the provided attributes, the following attributes could be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether the case is related to a citizen or not. If certain citizens are treated differently or have different outcomes in the process, it could raise fairness concerns.

2. `case:gender`: This attribute explicitly captures the gender of the case. Discriminating or treating cases differently based on gender would be a fairness issue.

3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute suggests that there might be differences in how cases involving German-speaking individuals are handled compared to non-German speakers. This could lead to potential unfairness or bias.

4. `case:private_insurance`: Having private insurance or not could potentially influence the treatment or outcomes of cases, which would be a fairness concern.

5. `case:underlying_condition`: If cases with underlying conditions are treated differently or have different outcomes compared to those without underlying conditions, it could raise fairness issues.

It's important to note that the sensitivity of an attribute for fairness depends on the specific context and goals of the analysis. Some attributes, like `resource` (which likely represents the healthcare professional handling the case), may not necessarily be sensitive for fairness but could still influence the process and its outcomes.

To ensure fairness, it's crucial to analyze the data for potential biases or disparities in treatment or outcomes across these sensitive attributes. Appropriate fairness metrics and mitigation strategies may need to be employed to address any identified fairness issues.
