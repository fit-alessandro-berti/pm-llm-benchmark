To identify which cases are taking significantly longer to complete, we first calculate the total duration for each case. The duration is calculated as the time difference between the "Submit Claim" activity and the "Close Claim" activity.

**Case Durations:**
- **Case 2001:** 00:30 (10:30 - 09:00)
- **Case 2002:** 22:55 (11:00 on April 2nd - 09:05 on April 1st)
- **Case 2003:** 53:20 (09:30 on April 3rd - 09:10 on April 1st)
- **Case 2004:** 01:25 (10:45 - 09:20)
- **Case 2005:** 81:25 (14:30 on April 4th - 09:25 on April 1st)

From this, we can see that **Cases 2002, 2003, and 2005** are taking significantly longer to complete. Let's analyze the attributes to determine potential root causes.

### Analysis of Attributes

#### Resource:
- **Case 2002:** Handled by Adjuster_Lisa (Region B)
- **Case 2003:** Handled by Adjuster_Mike (Region A)
- **Case 2005:** Handled by Adjuster_Lisa (Region B)

Both Adjuster_Lisa and Adjuster_Mike are involved in cases that take longer, but Adjuster_Lisa appears in two cases, suggesting a possible issue with this particular resource.

#### Region:
- **Case 2002:** Region B
- **Case 2003:** Region A
- **Case 2005:** Region B

Region B is involved in two out of the three cases with extended durations. This could indicate a potential issue with Region B in terms of resource availability or processing efficiency.

#### Complexity:
- **Case 2002:** Medium Complexity
- **Case 2003:** High Complexity
- **Case 2005:** High Complexity

High complexity cases (Cases 2003 and 2005) require multiple requests for additional documents, which suggests that complex claims are more likely to experience delays.

### Root Causes and Explanations

1. **High Complexity Claims:**
   - High complexity claims require more time and multiple rounds of additional documents, leading to extended durations. This is evident in Cases 2003 and 2005, which have high complexity and take significantly longer.

2. **Resource Handling:**
   - Adjuster_Lisa is involved in two cases with extended durations (Cases 2002 and 2005). This suggests that Adjuster_Lisa might be processing claims more slowly or might need additional support to handle claims efficiently.

3. **Regional Issues:**
   - Region B has two cases with extended durations (Cases 2002 and 2005), indicating that there might be a systemic issue in Region B, such as resource overloading or inefficiencies in the process.

### Suggestions to Mitigate Root Causes

1. **For High Complexity Claims:**
   - Implement a streamlined process for requesting and processing additional documents.
   - Increase the number of resources dedicated to handling high-complexity claims.
   - Train adjusters to handle complex claims more efficiently.

2. **For Resource Handling:**
   - Provide additional training and support to Adjuster_Lisa to help improve efficiency.
   - Consider redistributing the workload to ensure that no single resource is overburdened.

3. **For Regional Issues:**
   - Investigate the processes in Region B to identify any bottlenecks.
   - Transfer some of the workload from Region B to other regions if feasible.
   - Provide additional resources to Region B to improve processing times.

By addressing these root causes and implementing the suggested measures, the performance issues in the insurance claims processing can be significantly mitigated.
