**Explanation:**
1. **Coexistence Constraint:** We added constraints to ensure that if a decision is made for a sensitive applicant (e.g., `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), a `ManualReview` activity always coexists to provide an additional layer of scrutiny and fairness.

2. **Response Constraints:** We introduced a constraint where certain decision steps cannot immediately follow an activity revealing sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) without first performing a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This helps in verifying and correcting any bias introduced by sensitive attribute information.

3. **Non-Succession Constraints:** To prevent immediate biased outcomes, we included constraints that disallow a direct succession from a sensitive attribute event (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision event (`Reject`). This delay allows for necessary checks and evaluations before reaching a decision, reducing the impact of bias in the process.
