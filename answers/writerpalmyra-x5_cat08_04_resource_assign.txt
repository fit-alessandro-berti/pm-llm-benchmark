### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

To understand the effectiveness of TechSolve’s current resource assignment model, I would start by applying **deep process mining techniques** to the event log data, transforming raw events into actionable insights about agent behavior, interaction dynamics, and operational patterns.

#### **Key Metrics for Performance Analysis**
- **Workload Distribution**: Compute the number of tickets handled per agent and tier over time (e.g., tickets per day/week). Visualize using heatmaps or histograms to identify over- and under-utilized agents.
- **Processing Time per Activity**: Calculate average and median durations between "Work Start" and "Work End" for L1, L2, and L3 activities, segmented by priority and category. This reveals inefficiencies or delays at specific stages.
- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1**: Track percentage of tickets created and fully resolved by L1 agents without escalation. A low FCR suggests inadequate empowerment or training.
- **Escalation & Reassignment Frequency**: Measure how often tickets move across tiers or are reassigned within a tier. Flag cases with >2 reassignments as high-friction.
- **Skill Utilization Index**: For each agent, compare the required skills on assigned tickets vs. their documented skills. Calculate the % of time specialists (e.g., IAM, Firewall experts) are assigned to tasks outside their core competencies.

#### **Process Mining Techniques Applied**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis (RIA)**: Expose communication flows and handover frequency between agents. High interaction density between L1 and only a few L2 agents (e.g., Agent B12 handling most escalations) may indicate structural imbalances or bottlenecks.
- **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**: Build a network where nodes are agents and edges represent ticket handovers. Centrality measures (e.g., betweenness) identify “super-handlers” who act as informal hubs—this highlights risks if such agents are unavailable.
- **Role Discovery Algorithms**: Cluster agents based on observed behavior (activities performed, skills applied, handling times). Compare this with formal tier/skill labels. Discrepancies may reveal misaligned classifications (e.g., an L1 agent frequently resolving L2-level issues).
- **Variant Mining with Resource Context**: Extract the most common process paths and tag them with resource sequences. For example, do P3 Software-App tickets usually flow L1  L2-CRM  L2-SQL  L2-CRM again? Such loops expose design flaws.

#### **Actual vs. Intended Assignment Logic**
The log will likely show deviations from the formal escalation model:
- Round-robin assignments may result in random L1 pickup even when ticket complexity demands experience.
- Self-assignment (as seen in INC-1002) introduces bias and inconsistency.
- Escalations are often based on immediate availability rather than skill match, leading to reassignment downstream.

This analysis creates a **data-driven reality check**—revealing not just *what* the process is, but *who* is doing the work and how they interact across tiers.

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

Using filtered process views and statistical correlation, we can quantify the true cost of inefficient assignment.

#### **Pinpointing Key Problems**

**a) Skill Bottlenecks**
- **Analysis**: Identify tickets stuck in "Assigned L2" queue longer than SLA thresholds and check if they require rare skills (e.g., Security-IAM). Cross-reference with skill availability.
- **Metric Example**: Tickets requiring `Database-SQL` have 40% longer L2 queue wait time than average (mean = 8h vs. 5.6h), and 60% are reassigned at least once.
- **Impact**: Directly links scarcity of certain skills to delays.

**b) Reassignment Delays**
- **Analysis**: On average, each reassignment adds ~18 minutes of non-productive time (from log: time between “Reassign” and next “Work Start”).
- Filter tickets that were reassigned >2 times; 78% of these breach P3 SLA (vs. 29% overall).
- **Quantified Impact**: Frequent reassignment correlates with 2.6x higher SLA breach risk.

**c) Misclassification & Escalation Leaks**
- Many P2 tickets escalated after 5–10 minutes of L1 work suggest either poor triage or lack of autonomy.
- Example: 65% of `Network-Firewall` tickets get escalated within 15 minutes. But historical data shows only 30% actually require L3 input—many could be resolved by skilled L2 or empowered L1.

**d) Underperforming/Overloaded Agents**
- Agent workload variance: Top 20% of agents handle 45% of tickets; bottom 20% handle <10%.
- Some agents (e.g., Agent A05) show high ticket volume but also high escalation rate (60%), suggesting superficial resolution attempts.
- Conversely, Agent B12 resolves 90% of CRM tickets but is frequently delayed due to high queue load—indicating a *productivity drain* caused by poor load balancing.

**e) SLA Breach Root Tracing**
- Overlay SLA breaches onto process variants: 70% of breached P3 tickets involved 2 reassignments or an escalation to a less available skill group.
- 55% of breaches originated from initial misassignment of required skill.

These findings transform anecdotal concerns into **measurable inefficiencies**, enabling ROI estimation for targeted improvements.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

Beyond symptoms, we must diagnose systemic root causes driving poor assignment decisions, leveraging **variant analysis**, **decision mining**, and **attribute correlation**.

#### **Potential Root Causes**

| Cause | How Process Mining Uncovers It |
|------|-------------------------------|
| **Assignment Logic Ignores Skills & Workload** | Round-robin patterns in “Assign L1/L2” steps, regardless of required skill or agent workload. SNA shows some skilled agents rarely receive relevant tickets. |
| **Outdated or Incomplete Skill Profiles** | Agents assigned to tickets outside documented skills succeed (or fail)—indicating profiles are incorrect or incomplete. Decision trees reveal resolution likelihood based on unrecorded proficiencies. |
| **Poor Ticket Categorization at Entry** | Natural language analysis of ticket titles/descriptions vs. final resolution reveals misclassification. E.g., “CRM login error” initially tagged as `Access Management`, but later reassigned to `App-CRM`. |
| **No Real-Time Visibility into Availability** | Long assignment lags after "Escalate L2"  "Assign L2" suggest dispatcher cannot see who is free or skilled. Correlation between agent workload (active tickets) and assignment delay confirms this. |
| **L1 Agents Lack Tools/Knowledge to Diagnose Correct Skill Requirement** | Short L1 handling times (<10 mins) followed by escalation imply knee-jerk escalation. Mining diagnostic paths shows lack of structured troubleshooting leading to accurate tagging. |

#### **How Analytical Techniques Reveal Causes**
- **Variant Comparison**: Contrast two paths:
  - *Smooth Path*: L1  L2 (correct skill)  resolved.
  - *Reassignment Path*: L1  L2 (CRM)  Reassign  L2 (SQL).
  
  Decision mining reveals that the latter path occurs significantly more often when the ticket description contains “data” or “database,” but initial categorization was “Software-App” instead of “Database.” Hence, **inaccurate tagging** is a root trigger.

- **Statistical Correlation**: Ticket description length <50 words  3x higher reassignment rate. Suggests **poor intake information quality**.

- **Cluster-Based Root Cause Detection**: Group all tickets with 3 reassignments. Apply predictive feature importance to see top drivers: “Missing Required Skill” (importance = 0.58), “P3 Priority” (0.15), “Network Category” (0.12). Confirms skill mismatch dominates.

This multi-layered analysis shifts focus from *who* is slow to *why* the system steers tickets inefficiently.

### **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

Based on insights, here are **three concrete, scalable strategies** to optimize assignment logic using the organization’s existing data infrastructure.

---

#### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**

**Issue Addressed**: Mismatch between required skills and agent capabilities; underutilization of specialists.

**How It Leverages Analysis**:
- Uses skill-frequency patterns from role discovery and SNA to build a **skills adjacency matrix** (e.g., CRM tickets often need SQL support).
- Implements a scoring model: Each agent receives a compatibility score per ticket based on:
  - Exact skill match (+1.0)
  - Related skill (from co-occurrence patterns) (+0.6)
  - Historical success rate on similar tickets (+0.2 to +1.0 based on performance)
  - Skill proficiency level (if documented: Expert > Intermediate > Basic)

**Data Required**:
- Event logs (for historical matches and outcomes)
- Agent skill profiles (structured)
- Ticket attributes (category, required skill, priority)
- NLP-enabled ticket text parsing (to infer missing skill tags)

**Expected Benefits**:
-  30–40% reassignment rate
-  15–20% utilization of high-cost specialists on actual expert work
-  25% FCR at L2 level

---

#### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware, Dynamic Queue Assignment**

**Issue Addressed**: Overloaded agents, idle capacity, and delays from poor load distribution.

**How It Leverages Analysis**:
- Builds a real-time **agent workload index** using:
  - Number of active tickets
  - Complexity-weighted remaining effort (from process mining duration benchmarks)
  - SLA proximity (e.g., tickets within 2 hours of breach get higher urgency weight)
- Dispatch algorithm assigns incoming tickets to the agent with highest *skill fit* and lowest *workload index*.

**Data Required**:
- Real-time queue status
- Historical handling times by agent/ticket type
- SLA deadlines
- Agent availability (from login/activity logs)

**Implementation Approach**:
- Modify assignment automation rules in the service desk tool (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira) to use this dual-score (skill + capacity) engine.
- Visualize in a dispatcher dashboard showing color-coded agent load.

**Expected Benefits**:
-  50% imbalance in ticket volume per agent
-  20% average handling time due to reduced congestion
-  Dispatcher decision speed and consistency

---

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Skill Tagging & Early Escalation Routing**

**Issue Addressed**: Late or inaccurate identification of required skills leading to rework and delays.

**How It Leverages Analysis**:
- Apply **NLP + machine learning** on ticket descriptions at creation.
- Model trained on historical data: Predicts the actual *required skill* based on keywords, category, priority, and user profile.
  - E.g., “CRM report fails” + “SQL timeout”  predict `Database-SQL` even if initial tag is `App-CRM`.
- Tickets with high-predicted L2/L3 need can skip basic L1 screening or be routed to a specialized L1 team.

**Data Required**:
- Historical ticket descriptions and final resolved skills
- NLP preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, embedding)
- Labelled dataset for training (can be built from resolved tickets)
- Integration with intake forms/channels

**Optional Enhancement**: Introduce **L1 Triage Scorecards** with guided decision trees (e.g., “Does error mention database, timeout, or connection?”  escalate to L2 SQL pool).

**Expected Benefits**:
-  60% reassignment due to late skill discovery
-  35% accuracy of initial skill tagging
- Early routing could reduce L2 resolution time by 1–2 hours for complex cases

---

### **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

Before deploying changes, test rigorously and establish ongoing feedback loops.

#### **Simulation Using Process Models**

- **Input**: Mined process model (including gateways, delays, resource constraints), augmented with:
  - Agent skill matrices
  - Workload dynamics
  - SLA rules
- **Tools**: Use simulation engines (e.g., AnyLogic, PNSoft, Celonis Process Sphere) to model:
  - Current “as-is” process  baseline KPIs
  - “To-be” with new routing logic  projected outcomes
- **Simulate Scenarios**:
  - What if we roll out skill-based routing to 50% of tickets?
  - How does performance change during peak load?
  - What happens if 2 SQL experts are on leave?

**Output**: Predicted impact on:
- SLA breach rate
- Reassignment frequency
- Agent utilization
- Mean resolution time

This de-risks implementation and builds stakeholder confidence.

#### **Post-Implementation Monitoring with Process Mining Dashboards**

Deploy a **real-time process intelligence dashboard** tracking:

| **KPI / View** | **Purpose** |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Reassignment Rate per Tier & Skill** | Detect early if new logic is reducing handoffs |
| **SLA Breach Heatmap by Assignment Path** | Identify which paths still cause violations |
| **Agent Workload Balance Index** | Ensure no new overload patterns emerge |
| **Skill Match Score** | % of tickets assigned to agent with exact or high-fit skill |
| **First-Level Resolution Rate (FCR) by L1 Agent** | Track empowerment and training impact |
| **Process Variant Explorer with Resource Filter** | Quickly spot recurring inefficient paths (e.g., L1L2Reassign) |
| **Top Bottleneck Activities (with resource detail)** | Monitor “Work L2 Start” delays post-optimization |

**Frequency**: Daily monitoring for first 3 months; automated alerts on threshold breaches (e.g., reassignment rate  15% from baseline).

**Continuous Improvement Loop**:
- Quarterly: Run new process mining analysis.
- Retrain predictive models with fresh data.
- Refine skill taxonomies and routing rules.

### **Conclusion**

The root issue at TechSolve isn’t lack of skilled agents—it’s a **systematic misalignment between demand (ticket needs) and supply (agent capacity and expertise)**, compounded by a rigid, outdated assignment model.

By leveraging process mining, we move from intuition to **evidence-based optimization**—exposing hidden bottlenecks, quantifying waste, and designing intelligent assignment strategies that match the right ticket to the right agent at the right time.

The path forward combines:
- **Smarter routing** (skill + workload + prediction),
- **Improved triage accuracy**,
- and **closed-loop monitoring**.

The result? Faster resolution, fewer escalations, happier agents, and compliant, efficient service delivery—turning the service desk from a cost center into a strategic asset.
