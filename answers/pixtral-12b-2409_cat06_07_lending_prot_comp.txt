Based on the provided process variants and their execution times, here are the main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups:

1. **Process Complexity**:
   - The protected group has more complex processes with multiple visits and assessments (e.g., "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" and "Request Co-Signer On Loan"), while the unprotected group mostly follows a straightforward path ("Submit File to Underwriter").
   - The protected group also has more instances of loan denial after multiple assessments and visits, indicating a more rigorous evaluation process.

2. **Frequency of Loan Approval**:
   - The protected group has only one process variant leading to a loan agreement ("Sign Loan Agreement"), with a combined frequency of 96 (39 + 17 + 15 + 13 + 1), while the unprotected group has multiple variants leading to loan approval, with a combined frequency of 1947 (1656 + 188 + 183 + 44 + 40 + 12 + 5).
   - This suggests that the unprotected group is more likely to have their loans approved compared to the protected group.

3. **Frequency of Application Rejection and Appointment Denial**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of application rejection (960) and appointment denial (599) compared to the unprotected group (664 and 363, respectively).
   - This indicates that the protected group may face more barriers or hurdles in the initial stages of the process.

4. **Execution Time**:
   - The average execution time for the protected group is significantly higher (around 330,000 units) compared to the unprotected group (around 340,000 units).
   - This could be due to the more complex processes and additional assessments required for the protected group.

5. **Special Treatment**:
   - The protected group has a unique process variant "skipped_examination" that does not appear in the unprotected group's processes.
   - This could indicate a special treatment or exemption for the protected group, potentially due to their protected status.

These differences suggest that the protected group may face a more rigorous and time-consuming process, with fewer successful outcomes (loan approvals) compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate potential unfair treatment or bias in the process. However, it's essential to consider the context and reasons behind these differences, which may not be apparent from the given data alone.
