### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Initial Document Verification vs. Re-Verify Documents:**
   - **Initial Document Verification:** This activity occurs early in the process and involves the first check of the customer's documents.
   - **Re-Verify Documents:** This activity occurs later in the process, typically after additional documents have been submitted or adjustments have been made, indicating a second or subsequent verification.

2. **Call for Missing Documents vs. Call for Account Clarification vs. Call for Customer Return vs. Confirm Adjustments Call:**
   - **Call for Missing Documents:** This call is specifically to request missing documents from the customer.
   - **Call for Account Clarification:** This call is to clarify discrepancies or issues related to the customer's account.
   - **Call for Customer Return:** This call is to ask the customer to return to the branch after they have stepped out.
   - **Confirm Adjustments Call:** This call is to confirm with the customer that the adjustments made to their account are correct.

3. **Adjust Account Details:**
   - This activity involves making internal corrections or adjustments to the customer's account details, typically after a call or verification process.

4. **Final Approval:**
   - This activity represents the final step in the process where a supervisor gives the final approval for the request.

By renaming the activities in this manner, the contextual differences are clearly highlighted, making the process flow more understandable and disambiguating the activities.
