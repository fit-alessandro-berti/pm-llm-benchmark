###  **Assumptions & Notes**

1. **Case ID**: Used `order_id` as the primary case identifier, consistent across all related tables.
2. **Activity Derivation**:
   - "Item Picked" events are created **per line item** to preserve detail and enable analysis of picking delays or inefficiencies.
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" are derived **per delivery**, meaning multiple events per order if multiple shipments (e.g., order 1002).
   - "Invoice Issued" and "Payment Received" are linked via `invoice_id`. Multiple payments allowed per order (e.g., 1002).
3. **Resource Enrichment**: Used the **Resources Table** to map IDs to actual names and roles (e.g., WH-001  David Lin).
4. **Item Descriptions**: Enriched line items using the **Products Table** for better context.
5. **Missing Data (Order 1004)**:
   - Delivery, invoice, and payment data are missing. Events are still included with `—` and a justification to maintain traceability.
   - This allows downstream process mining to identify bottlenecks (e.g., stuck after picking).
6. **Payment Resource**: Since payments are typically processed via system or third-party gateways, the "Resource/Actor" is labeled as `"System ({payment_method})"` unless a specific clerk is known (not provided).
7. **Timestamp Accuracy**: All timestamps retained in UTC (as in original data). No timezone conversion applied.

This event log is now ready for process discovery (e.g., using Alpha Algorithm, Heuristics Miner, or visualization tools like ProM or Disco), conformance checking, or bottleneck analysis. Let me know if you’d like it exported in CSV format or enhanced with KPIs (e.g., cycle time, delays).
