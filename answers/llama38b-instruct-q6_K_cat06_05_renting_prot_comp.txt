Based on the provided data, I've identified some unfair differences in the treatment of the "protected" group (first) and the unprotected group:

1. **Tenant protection**: The protected group has a higher frequency of tenants moving in and paying rent compared to the unprotected group. This suggests that the protected group is more likely to be successful in their tenancy, which may not be the case for the unprotected group.
2. **Rent payment history**: The protected group has a longer duration of rent payments (up to 9 months) before canceling the apartment, whereas the unprotected group's longest sequence of rent payments is only up to 7 months.
3. **Screening process**: The unprotected group has more varied and extensive screening processes, including "Extensive Screening" and "Reject Prospective Tenant", which may indicate a more thorough evaluation of applicants.
4. **Cancellation rate**: The protected group has a lower cancellation rate compared to the unprotected group. This could imply that the protected group is less likely to terminate their tenancy early.

As for the domain knowledge, I'll provide some insights based on typical real estate and property management practices:

1. **Tenant selection**: Property managers may have different standards for selecting tenants, which can influence the outcome of the screening process.
2. **Risk assessment**: Properties with protected groups might be more cautious in their tenant selection, as they prioritize stability and reduced risk.
3. **Lease agreements**: Protected groups might have stricter lease agreements or additional clauses that protect both parties' interests.
4. **Communication**: The level of communication between property managers and tenants can impact the overall tenancy experience and cancellation rates.

Keep in mind that these findings are based on the provided data, which may not represent a comprehensive picture of the entire market. Further investigation into the underlying factors and variables would be necessary to draw more robust conclusions.
