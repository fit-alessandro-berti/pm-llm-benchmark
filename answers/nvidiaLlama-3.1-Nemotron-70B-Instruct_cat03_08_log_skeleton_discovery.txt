Based on the provided process variants, I'll derive the Log Skeleton model as a Python dictionary. Please note that:

1. **Equivalence**: No clear evidence of equivalent activities (i.e., always occurring together with the same frequency) could be deduced directly from the variants. Therefore, this section will be left empty.
2. **Always Before** and **Always After**: These will be inferred from the sequential nature of the process variants. 
3. **Never Together**: This will be derived by identifying activities that never co-occur in any variant.
4. **Activity Occurrences (activ_freq)**: Frequency bounds for each activity will be estimated based on their occurrence across all variants.
5. **Directly-Follows Constraints**: Derived from the explicit sequential order in each variant.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No equivalence found based on provided data
    
    'always_before': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'),
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'),
        ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'),  # Generic 'always before' based on most frequent paths
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'),  # Since both 'Send for Credit Collection' and 'Payment' can follow 'Add penalty'
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'),  # Direct transition in some paths
        ('Send Fine', 'Payment'),  # Direct transition in some paths, noting 'Insert Fine Notification' might be skipped
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'),
        ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Appeal to Judge'),  # Where applicable
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Payment'),  # Direct in some paths
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Send for Credit Collection'),  # In other paths
        ('Appeal to Judge', 'Add penalty'),  # Based on observed sequences
    },
    
    'always_after': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Create Fine'),
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Send Fine'),
        ('Add penalty', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
        ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Add penalty'),  # Or after 'Payment' in some cases, not explicitly listed due to 'or' condition
        ('Payment', 'Add penalty'),  # Or could follow other activities not directly before it in all cases
        ('Payment', 'Create Fine'),  # Directly after in some variants
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
        ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'),
        ('Appeal to Judge', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),  # When it occurs
        ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),  # In applicable paths
        ('Payment', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),  # Similarly
    },
    
    'never_together': set(),  # Given the data, it's challenging to assert 'never together' without more context on activity exclusivity.
                           # Activities like 'Send for Credit Collection' and 'Payment' seem mutually exclusive in the paths
                           # provided, but without explicit rules, this remains speculative.
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Fine': {1},  # Always occurs once
        'Send Fine': {1},  # Assuming it's a mandatory step when it appears
        'Insert Fine Notification': {0, 1},  # Can be skipped or occur once
        'Add penalty': {0, 1},  # Presence varies across paths
        'Send for Credit Collection': {0, 1},  # Not in all paths
        'Payment': {1, 2, 3, 4},  # Variability in payment occurrences
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {0, 1},
        'Appeal to Judge': {0, 1},  # Optional step
    },
    
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'),
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'),  # Direct in some cases
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
        ('Send Fine', 'Payment'),  # Skipping 'Insert Fine Notification' in some paths
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'),
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Payment'),  # Directly to payment in some variants
        ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'),
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'),
        ('Add penalty', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'),
        ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'),
        ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'),
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Appeal to Judge'),
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Payment'),
        ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Send for Credit Collection'),
        ('Appeal to Judge', 'Add penalty'),
        ('Payment', 'Payment'),  # To account for multiple payments
    }
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Never Together**: Without explicit rules on activity exclusivity, asserting 'never together' constraints is speculative. Activities like 'Send for Credit Collection' and 'Payment' seem mutually exclusive but are not listed as such here.
  
- **Frequency Bounds (activ_freq)**: These are estimates based on the provided variants. Real-world application may require adjustment based on additional process insights or rules not captured here.

- **Directly-Follows and Always Before/After**: Derived from observed sequences. The model might need refinement if there are unseen variants or additional process rules.

- **Equivalence**: Given the data, no clear equivalences were identified. If activities always occur together with the same frequency in other unseen variants, this section should be updated accordingly. 

This model provides a foundational structure based on the given process variants. Further refinement, especially considering unseen variants or additional process rules, might be necessary for a more accurate and comprehensive Log Skeleton model.
