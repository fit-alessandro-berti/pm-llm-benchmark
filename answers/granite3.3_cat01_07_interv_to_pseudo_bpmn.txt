**Textual Process Model Description:**

The invoice approval process can be described as follows:

1. **Start:** An invoice arrives (usually by email).

2. **Task: Check PO Validity (Mary, Accounts Payable Clerk)**
   - Activity: Verify if the invoice has a valid associated purchase order (PO) number.
   - Decision Point: 
     - If no PO or mismatch: Send invoice back to supplier for additional details.
     - If PO matches: Proceed to log invoice into accounting system.

3. **Task: Log Invoice (Mary)**
   - Activity: Enter the invoice details into the accounting system with a reference to the PO.

4. **Task: Purchasing Confirmation Request (Mary)**
   - Activity: Send the logged invoice to the purchasing department for confirmation of receipt and alignment with original order.
   
5. **Task: Match Invoice and PO (Mary)**
   - Activity: Compare line items on the invoice against those in the PO within the system.
   - Decision Point:
     - If discrepancies exist, escalate to Purchasing for clarification or directly involve Rita if resolution isn't immediate.

6. **Task: Managerial Approval Request (System)**
   - Activity: Upon confirmation from Purchasing, an automatic email triggers manager's approval via the system.

7. **Task: Manager Review and Decision (Carlos, Department Manager)**
   - Activity: Receive notification with invoice details, PO, and confirmation; approve if everything checks out or reject/request further investigation.
   
8. **Task: Final Confirmation (Dan, Purchasing Officer)**
   - Activity: Send back confirmation of approval to Accounts Payable once the manager's decision is finalized.

9. **Exception Handling:**
   - If discrepancies cannot be resolved through usual means (Mary or Dan), escalate to Rita, the supervisor. 
   - Rita coordinates between departments and with suppliers (sometimes involving Karen).
   - She resolves issues such as missing PO numbers or incorrect pricing, potentially creating a retrospective PO if necessary.
   - Resolved invoices return to normal flow for final approval.

10. **Task: Payment Scheduling (Accounts Payable)**
    - Activity: Once approved by the manager, schedule the invoice for payment within the next cycle.

11. **Role of Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager):**
    - Indirect involvement occurs when discrepancies are identified—Karen facilitates communication with suppliers to rectify issues like missing PO numbers or pricing errors, ensuring invoices comply with contractual terms before returning them for standard processing.

**Note:** There is some ambiguity regarding the exact triggers for managerial review (e.g., discrepancies and their thresholds) and how often exceptions occur (Rita's involvement frequency). However, this model attempts to encapsulate the clear majority of typical invoice approval steps based on provided interview insights.
