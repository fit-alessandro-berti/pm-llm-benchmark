This visualization consists of three parts showing different aspects of a medical laboratory system:

## (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels
This is a complex workflow diagram showing the interaction between laboratory visits and tests. The diagram includes:

- **Two main proclet classes**: "Lab visit" and "Lab test" (shown in boxes on the right)
- **Multiple actors/roles** (shown as stick figures): doctor, lab assistant, lab, and lab employee
- **Process flows** with activities like:
  - Order entry and taking blood samples
  - Receiving results and judging them
  - Performing tests and making reports
  - Finishing lab tests and providing updated reports
- **Communication channels** (numbered 1-13) connecting different activities
- **HIS (Hospital Information System)** integration points shown with dashed lines
- The diagram uses standard workflow notation with circles for start/end points and rectangles for activities

## (b) Class diagram
A simple UML-style class diagram showing:
- Two classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test"
- A relationship indicating that Lab visit "requires" Lab test with cardinality notations (1..1 and 1..*)

## (c) Example of a performative
A table showing the structure of a communication message with columns:
- Time (11:00)
- Channel (Order system)
- Sender (Lab visit - John)
- Receivers (Lab test - HGB John)
- Action (Create)
- Content (Can you perform a HGB test for John?)
- Scope (Private)
- Direction (OUT)

This appears to be documenting a healthcare laboratory workflow system with inter-process communication mechanisms.
