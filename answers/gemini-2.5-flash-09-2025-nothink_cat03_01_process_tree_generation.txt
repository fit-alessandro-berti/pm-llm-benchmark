The complex hospital patient management process can be modeled using the specified Process Tree operators. We will construct the model by sequentially combining the stages defined in the description.

Let $P$ denote the entire complex process tree.

### Stage-by-Stage Construction

**1. Initial Patient Entry (A, RG, IA):**
The first three steps are sequential.
$$S_1 = \rightarrow('A', \rightarrow('RG', 'IA'))$$

**2. Triage and Classification (TI, TC):**
These two steps follow $S_1$ and are also sequential.
$$S_2 = \rightarrow('TI', 'TC')$$
The combination of stages 1 and 2 is:
$$P_{A} = \rightarrow(S_1, S_2) = \rightarrow('A', \rightarrow('RG', \rightarrow('IA', \rightarrow('TI', 'TC'))))$$
*(Note: For simplicity in the final structure, we'll keep the sequential structure flat.)*
$$P_{A} = \rightarrow('A', 'RG', 'IA', 'TI', 'TC')$$

**3. Initial Diagnostic Exclusive Choice (CE or FBP):**
This choice follows the Triage Classification (TC).
$$S_3 = X('CE', 'FBP')$$

The process so far is:
$$P_{B} = \rightarrow(P_A, S_3)$$

**4. The Conditional Loop (*):**
If initial results are abnormal, a loop starts. This loop structure repeats the sequence (SC $\rightarrow$ Treatment Choice $\rightarrow$ RDT Choice).

First, define the **Treatment Choice** (TM or SPT):
$$S_{Treat} = X('TM', 'SPT')$$

Next, define the **Re-Diagnostic Test (RDT) Choice** (FCE or FBA). RDT is the name for the step, but the choice itself is the content.
$$S_{RDT} = X('FCE', 'FBA')$$

The body of the loop ($B_{Loop}$) consists of the sequence: Specialist Consultation, followed by the Treatment Choice, followed by the RDT Choice.
$$B_{Loop} = \rightarrow('SC', \rightarrow(S_{Treat}, S_{RDT}))$$

The loop structure $(* (A, B))$ means A is executed, then either exit or execute B, then A again. Here, the loop body $B_{Loop}$ is executed, and if the condition (abnormal results) is met, a silent step ($\tau$) represents the exit choice, and the full body $B_{Loop}$ is executed again.

In standard process tree notation for a "do-while-abnormal" loop, the structure is:
$$S_{Loop} = *(\tau, B_{Loop})$$
*Interpretation: $\tau$ (exit) is the first option. If $\tau$ is chosen, the loop is skipped/exited. If $B_{Loop}$ is chosen, the body executes, and the loop decision is re-evaluated.*

However, given the description: "If the results are abnormal, a loop commences... This loop repeats: after the re-diagnostic test, if the results are still abnormal, the patient returns to the Specialist Consultation... Once normal results are obtained, the loop ends."
This implies the loop body ($B_{Loop}$) must be executed at least once if the initial diagnostic test yields an abnormal result. Since the loop must only start if results are abnormal, the most straightforward modeling uses a standard loop structure where the body is executed until an exit condition is met, and $\tau$ represents the termination path.

Let's assume the loop structure $* (A, B)$ means: $A$ is the body, $B$ is the follow-up step before deciding to repeat $A$. In pm4py, $* (A, B)$ typically models the structure: execute A, then either exit (B = $\tau$) or execute B (which is usually $\tau$ but here we define the exit step) and repeat A.

The most common way to model a zero-to-many loop (or do-while loop) in process trees is:
$$S_{Loop} = * (B_{Loop}, \tau)$$
where $B_{Loop}$ is executed until the silent step $\tau$ is chosen, signaling the exit.

$$S_4 = * (B_{Loop}, \tau) = * (\rightarrow('SC', \rightarrow(X('TM', 'SPT'), X('FCE', 'FBA'))), \tau)$$

The overall process combining sequential stages and the loop:
$$P_{C} = \rightarrow(P_B, S_4)$$

**5. Advanced Diagnostics and Support (AI, NC):**
After the loop, these two activities happen in true concurrency (+).
$$S_5 = +('AI', 'NC')$$
The process continues sequentially:
$$P_{D} = \rightarrow(P_C, S_5)$$

**6. Final Informational Steps (FAS, DDI):**
These two are sequential.
$$S_6 = \rightarrow('FAS', 'DDI')$$
The process continues sequentially:
$$P_{E} = \rightarrow(P_D, S_6)$$

**7. Final Administrative Clearance (BL, ICP, MRF):**
These three activities happen in true concurrency (+).
$$S_7 = +('BL', +('ICP', 'MRF'))$$
*(Note: Nesting concurrency operations is equivalent to a flat concurrency list.)*
$$S_7 = +('BL', 'ICP', 'MRF')$$

**8. Final Sequence:**
The final process is the sequence of $P_E$ and $S_7$.
$$P = \rightarrow(P_E, S_7)$$

### Final Integrated Process Tree

By substituting the nested definitions, the final complex process tree $P$ is:

$$
P = \rightarrow ( \\
\quad \rightarrow ( 'A', 'RG', 'IA', 'TI', 'TC' ), \\
\quad X('CE', 'FBP'), \\
\quad * ( \\
\quad \quad \rightarrow ( 'SC', \\
\quad \quad \quad \rightarrow ( \\
\quad \quad \quad \quad X('TM', 'SPT'), \\
\quad \quad \quad \quad X('FCE', 'FBA') \\
\quad \quad \quad ) \\
\quad \quad ), \tau \\
\quad ), \\
\quad + ('AI', 'NC'), \\
\quad \rightarrow ( 'FAS', 'DDI' ), \\
\quad + ('BL', 'ICP', 'MRF') \\
)
