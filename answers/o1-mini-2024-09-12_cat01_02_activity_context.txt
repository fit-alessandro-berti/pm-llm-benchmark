**Justification for Renaming Activities:**

1. **Verify Documents:**
   - **Initial Document Verification:** This name is used for the first instance where the agent performs the initial check of the customer's identity documents.
   - **Re-Verify Documents After Submission:** Applied when documents are checked again after the customer submits additional information, highlighting the secondary verification step.

2. **Call Customer:**
   - **Call to Request Missing Documents:** Specifies that the purpose of the call is to obtain additional documents needed for verification.
   - **Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy:** Indicates that the call aims to resolve inconsistencies or issues related to the customer's account.
   - **Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments:** Clarifies that this call is a follow-up to ensure that previously made adjustments meet the customer's needs.
   - **Call to Request Return to Branch:** Specifies that the call is to ask the customer to return to the branch, often due to incomplete information or further assistance needed.

3. **Adjust Account:**
   - **Internal Account Adjustment:** Denotes that the account changes are made internally, often following a customer interaction or identified discrepancy.
   - **Internal Correction Due to Missing Info:** Highlights that the adjustment is a corrective action taken because of previously missing or incomplete information.

These renamings enhance clarity by explicitly stating the purpose and context of each activity, thereby disambiguating activities that originally shared the same name but served different roles within the process flow.
