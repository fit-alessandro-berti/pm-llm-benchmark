To construct the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process, we need to define the constraints based on the provided activities and their logical relationships. Let's define each constraint as specified:

1. **Equivalence:** If one activity occurs, the other must occur the same number of times.
2. **Always Before:** If one activity occurs, the other must have occurred before it.
3. **Always After:** If one activity occurs, the other must occur after it.
4. **Never Together:** The two activities cannot occur in the same case.
5. **Activity Occurrences:** Defines the number of times each activity can occur.
6. **Directly-Follows:** If one activity occurs, the other must occur immediately after.

Given the activities and their typical sequence in an order fulfillment process, we can define the constraints as follows:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Reserve Items (RI)', 'Pick Items (PI)'),  # Equivalence between RI and PI
        ('Generate Shipping Label (GSL)', 'Dispatch (D)')  # Equivalence between GSL and D
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Check Availability (CA)', 'Reserve Items (RI)'),  # CA must always occur before RI
        ('Reserve Items (RI)', 'Pick Items (PI)'),  # RI must always occur before PI
        ('Pick Items (PI)', 'Quality Check (QC)'),  # PI must always occur before QC
        ('Quality Check (QC)', 'Pack Order (PO)'),  # QC must always occur before PO
        ('Pack Order (PO)', 'Generate Shipping Label (GSL)'),  # PO must always occur before GSL
        ('Generate Shipping Label (GSL)', 'Dispatch (D)'),  # GSL must always occur before D
        ('Record Payment (RP)', 'Invoice Customer (IC)')  # RP must always occur before IC
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Receive Order (RO)', 'Check Availability (CA)'),  # RO must always occur after CA
        ('Generate Shipping Label (GSL)', 'Invoice Customer (IC)'),  # GSL must always occur after IC
        ('Dispatch (D)', 'Invoice Customer (IC)')  # D must always occur after IC
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('Record Payment (RP)', 'Generate Shipping Label (GSL)'),  # RP and GSL cannot occur together
        ('Record Payment (RP)', 'Dispatch (D)')  # RP and D cannot occur together
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order (RO)': {1},  # RO must occur exactly once
        'Check Availability (CA)': {1},  # CA must occur exactly once
        'Reserve Items (RI)': {1},  # RI must occur exactly once
        'Pick Items (PI)': {1},  # PI must occur exactly once
        'Quality Check (QC)': {1},  # QC must occur exactly once
        'Pack Order (PO)': {1},  # PO must occur exactly once
        'Generate Shipping Label (GSL)': {1},  # GSL must occur exactly once
        'Dispatch (D)': {1},  # D must occur exactly once
        'Invoice Customer (IC)': {1},  # IC must occur exactly once
        'Record Payment (RP)': {1}  # RP must occur exactly once
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order (RO)', 'Check Availability (CA)'),  # RO must be immediately followed by CA
        ('Check Availability (CA)', 'Reserve Items (RI)'),  # CA must be immediately followed by RI
        ('Reserve Items (RI)', 'Pick Items (PI)'),  # RI must be immediately followed by PI
        ('Pick Items (PI)', 'Quality Check (QC)'),  # PI must be immediately followed by QC
        ('Quality Check (QC)', 'Pack Order (PO)'),  # QC must be immediately followed by PO
        ('Pack Order (PO)', 'Generate Shipping Label (GSL)'),  # PO must be immediately followed by GSL
        ('Generate Shipping Label (GSL)', 'Dispatch (D)'),  # GSL must be immediately followed by D
        ('Dispatch (D)', 'Invoice Customer (IC)')  # D must be immediately followed by IC
    }
}
```

This dictionary captures the essential constraints for the order fulfillment process, ensuring that each activity occurs in the correct sequence and adheres to the specified rules.
