Here's an example implementation of a purchase-to-pay process using pm4py:

```python
import pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj
from pm4py.log import set_logger
set_logger('purchase_to_pay')

# Define the operator sequence type
OP_SEQUENCE = 'PurchaseToPay'

# Create the process tree nodes as children without being parented yet
root = pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTree(operator=pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.PARALLEL, label='Root')
purchase = pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTree(operator=pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.LOOP, label='Purchase', parent=root)

# Define the purchase to pay process tree
add_flow_root = pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTreeNode(
    operator=pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.PARALLEL,
    label='Buy',
    children=([pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTreeNode(operator=pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.LOOP, label='Payment'),])

add_purchase_flow = pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTreeNode(
    operator=pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.XOR,
    label='IsPurchaseMade',
)

buy_activity = 'Buy'
if add_purchase_flow.children[0] == None:
  # Create the activity buy
  buying_activity = pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessActivity(
      parent=add_purchase_flow, 
      trigger_value=add_purchase_flow.label, 
      trigger_operator=pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.XOR,
      output_value='IsPurchaseMade',
      label=buying_activity,
      operation_type=pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.OperationType.ASTERT
  )
  add_buyer_activity = pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessActivity(
    parent=add_purchase_flow,
    trigger_value=add_purchase_flow.label, 
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    output_value='Buy',
    label='Buy',
    operation_type=pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj OperationType.FAST
  )
   # Define the flow using the parallel execution model for parallel behavior within the same process tree node and adding a 'Parallel' child on top of it.
  if add_buyer_activity.label != buy_activity:
     ParallelFlow(
      parent=add_purchase_flow, 
      children=[buying_activity],  
       label='Buy',
      operator=Operator.PARA
    )

add_payment_activity = pm4py_objects.process_tree.obj.ProgressActivity(
          'Payment', 'Status of payment'
        )
  root.children.append(buyer_activity)
  root.children.append(PaymentFlow(add_purchase_flow, parallel_flow=add_buyer_activity))
  
 add_purchase_flow.left_operator=XOR

```

The code defines a purchase-to-pay process by creating nodes for the sequence (PARALLEL), buy activity and payment activities. Each activity has the necessary attributes defined with the corresponding pm4py operations to perform that activity. The `add_purchase_flow` creates a loop containing a parallel flow using the XOR operator, which simulates true concurrency. In addition, buying an item and then paying for it are separate activities within their respective loops.

Please note that you should adjust and expand on this example based on your specific PM 4py process tree structure and requirements to ensure efficient functionality.
