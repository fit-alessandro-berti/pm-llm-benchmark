# BPMN Process Diagram: Order Fulfillment Process

This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** depicting an order fulfillment workflow across **four organizational lanes (swim lanes)**:

---

## 1. **Sales** (Top Lane)
- The process begins with a **timer event** triggered on **Monday morning**
- **Check order for completeness** is performed
- A subprocess called **"Check customer's order"** includes:
  - Checking if the customer is already in the database
  - An **exclusive gateway** determines: if the customer is **not in the database**, they are added (with a database data store); if they **are**, the flow continues
- After the subprocess, **Send order details** occurs (triggering a message to Production and Procurement)
- The process concludes with **Draft invoice** and an end event

## 2. **Production** (Second Lane)
- Triggered by a **message event** ("Order details arrive")
- A **parallel gateway** splits the flow
- **Plan production** is executed
- An intermediate event checks if **material is not faulty**
- **Manufacture product** follows
- Ends with a **"Product complete"** signal event

## 3. **Procurement** (Third Lane)
- Also triggered by **"Order details arrive"** message event
- Contains a **Material Compensation Subprocess** including:
  - **Order materials**  **Check materials**
  - A **compensation handler** for **Return material** if needed
- Handles **order cancellation** via a termination/cancel event

## 4. **Warehouse** (Bottom Lane)
- Triggered by a **"Product complete"** message event
- Performs **Send product**
- Ends with a **"Product sent"** signal/end event

---

## Key Features
- **Dashed message flows** connect the lanes, showing inter-departmental communication (e.g., "Order details" flowing from Sales to Production and Procurement)
- **Compensation events** handle material returns in Procurement
- The diagram uses standard BPMN elements: gateways, events (timer, message, signal, compensation), tasks, subprocesses, and data stores
