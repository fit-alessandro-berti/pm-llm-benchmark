<think>
First, I need to create two POWL models based on the hiring process description.

The first one is "POWL Model with Potential Unfairness." This should include an XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch is a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other is a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that gives an advantage.

The second one is "POWL Model Without Unfairness." Here, all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation, without any special branching for community affiliations.

From the description, the key steps are:

1. ReceiveApplication (including resume and questionnaire)

2. Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: This involves a loop for data completeness.

3. Preliminary Skill Assessment

4. Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check: In the first model, this has an XOR.

5. Managerial Review & Final Decision

I need to use POWL elements: activities (Transitions), choices (XOR), loops, and partial orders.

Let me outline the first model:

- Start with receiving the application.

- Then, a loop for data completeness: If data is missing, request more info and go back.

- After that, skill assessment.

- Then, XOR: One path for standard cultural fit, another for community affiliation check.

- Finally, managerial review and final decision.

The description says: After skill assessment, there's an XOR for cultural fit or community affiliation.

Specifically: "an XOR choice in the process: either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments."

So, in POWL, that would be an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator between two sub-models: one for standard cultural fit, and one for community affiliation check.

After that, proceed to managerial review and final decision.

The overall process is sequential with this XOR in the middle.

For the second model, no XOR; just a straight cultural fit check.

Also, there's a loop at the beginning for data completeness.

So, let's define the activities:

- ReceiveApplication: Transition("ReceiveApplication")

- DataCompletenessCheck: This might be part of the loop.

The loop is between checking data and requesting more info.

From the description: "Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding."

So, probably: After ReceiveApplication, do a check, and if incomplete, loop back to request more info.

In POWL, a loop is defined as * (A, B), where you execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

So, perhaps A is the data check and request, and B is something that leads back.

I need to model it carefully.

Let me think: Let's say A is "DataCompletenessCheck", which might include requesting more info if needed.

But in POWL, the loop * (A, B) means execute A, then decide to exit or execute B then A again.

A common way is to have A as the main activity, and B as the loop body.

For simplicity, I can have:

- ReceiveApplication

- Then a loop: * (ProcessApplicationData, RequestMoreInfo)

But perhaps more precisely:

Let’s define:

First, ReceiveApplication.

Then, a loop that checks for completeness.

So, maybe: After ReceiveApplication, have a loop between "CheckData" and "RequestMoreInfo".

In the example, it's * (A, B), where A is executed, then either exit or B then A.

So, perhaps A = "CheckDataAndRequestIfNeeded", but that might not fit.

I can have the loop around the data handling part.

To keep it simple, let's say:

Have a sub-model for the loop: * (ParseResume, RequestMoreInfo)

Where ParseResume might include the check, and if incomplete, it leads to RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back.

In POWL, it's abstract.

For the first model:

Overall structure:

- Partial order: Sequence of: ReceiveApplication, then the loop, then SkillAssessment, then the XOR (CulturalFit or CommunityAffiliationCheck), then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

Yes.

For the second model: Same, but instead of XOR, just CulturalFitCheck.

So, let's list the nodes:

Common nodes:

- ReceiveApplication: Transition("ReceiveApplication")

- ParseResume: This could be part of the loop. Wait, no: The loop is for data completeness.

From the description: "Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: An automated system scans resumes... If missing, ask for more."

So, perhaps: Have a loop: * (InitialDataCheck, RequestMoreInfo)

Where InitialDataCheck performs the parsing and check, and if incomplete, it might trigger RequestMoreInfo, but in POWL, the loop handles the repetition.

Perhaps it's easier to think of it as: The loop is * (AttemptDataProcessing, HandleIncompleteData)

But to match, let's say the loop node is * (DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo)

Then, after the loop, proceed to SkillAssessment, etc.

Yes.

So, for both models:

Root POWL: StrictPartialOrder with nodes: [loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_or_cultural, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

And order: loop_node --> SkillAssessment --> xor_or_cultural --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision

For the first model, xor_or_cultural = XOR (StandardCulturalFit, CommunityAffiliationCheck)

For the second, xor_or_cultural = StandardCulturalFit  (just a single transition)

Yes.

First, define the individual transitions:

import statements as given.

A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")  Wait, no, I need to define them separately.

In my root, the first node is the loop, so perhaps the partial order starts with the loop.

The description starts with receiving applications, so maybe have ReceiveApplication before the loop.

The process: "Applicants first submit their resumes... Once the basic application data is received: 1. Resume Parsing..."

So, perhaps ReceiveApplication is before the loop.

In POWL, I can include it in the partial order.

So, for the root StrictPartialOrder, nodes: [ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_or_cultural, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

Order: ReceiveApplication --> loop_node --> SkillAssessment --> xor_or_cultural --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision

Yes.

First, define:

ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition(label="DataCheck"), Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")])

In the example, loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])

So, yes: children=[DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo], where DataCheck = Transition(label="DataCheck"), etc.

SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

For first model: xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit"), Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")])

For second model: cultural_node = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  // a single one, without XOR

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Then, root1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_node, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

root1.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)

root1.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)

root1.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_node)

root1.order.add_edge(xor_node, ManagerialReview)

root1.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

For root2: StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, cultural_node, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

With the same edges, but replacing xor_node with cultural_node.

Yes!

In the second model, it's "all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process", so cultural_node = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

And in the first, the XOR is between StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

I think that matches.

One more thing: In the description, for the first model, it's "either standard cultural fit or community affiliation check", so yes.

Alright, now I need to output this in the response.

I'll write the code snippets for both models.
</think>

Below is the implementation of the two POWL models based on the provided textual description of the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. I'll first explain the key elements and differences between the two models, then provide the Python code snippets using the `pm4py` library as specified.

### Key Elements and Differences:
- **Common Structure**: Both models include the following sequential elements derived from the description:
  - **ReceiveApplication**: Represents the initial submission of resumes and questionnaires.
  - **Loop for Data Completeness**: A loop between "DataCheck" (parsing and checking for completeness) and "RequestMoreInfo" (asking for additional details if needed). This handles the iterative process for ensuring data is complete.
  - **SkillAssessment**: The preliminary skill-based assessment, which follows the loop.
  - **ManagerialReview and FinalDecision**: These come after the cultural fit stage and represent the human review and final hiring decision.
  
- **Differences in Cultural Fit Handling**:
  - **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**: After the skill assessment, an XOR operator introduces a branching point. One branch is a standard cultural fit evaluation ("StandardCulturalFit"), and the other is a community affiliation check ("CommunityAffiliationCheck"). This XOR can lead to subtle biases, as applicants with certain affiliations might be routed to the latter branch, giving them an advantage.
  - **POWL Model Without Unfairness**: After the skill assessment, all applicants go through a single, uniform cultural fit evaluation ("CulturalFitCheck"). There is no XOR branching, eliminating the potential for bias based on affiliations.

- **POWL Constructs Used**:
  - **Transitions**: For simple activities like "ReceiveApplication", "SkillAssessment", etc.
  - **OperatorPOWL with LOOP**: For the data completeness loop, using `* (DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo)`.
  - **OperatorPOWL with XOR**: Only in the first model, for the branching in cultural fit evaluation.
  - **StrictPartialOrder**: To define the overall partial order, ensuring a sequential flow between nodes.

The models are implemented in Python using `pm4py`. I've included the necessary imports and code for each model.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model includes an XOR branching after the skill assessment, where one path is for standard cultural fit evaluation and the other is for community affiliation check. This reflects the potential for unfairness, as described in the process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCheck = Transition(label="DataCheck")  # Resume parsing and initial check
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")  # Request additional details if incomplete
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")  # Preliminary skill-based assessment
StandardCulturalFit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit")  # Standard cultural fit evaluation
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Community affiliation check with potential bias
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")  # Human review of candidates
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")  # Final hiring decision

# Define the loop for data completeness
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR for cultural fit branching
xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFit, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the root partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_node, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add edges to define the order
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)  # Receive application before data check loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)  # Data check loop before skill assessment
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_node)  # Skill assessment before XOR branching
root.order.add_edge(xor_node, ManagerialReview)  # XOR outcome before managerial review
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)  # Managerial review before final decision

# The model is now ready; you can visualize or export it using pm4py functions if needed.
```

**Explanation of Unfairness**: In this model, the XOR node (`xor_node`) represents the point where bias can creep in. Applicants might be directed to the "CommunityAffiliationCheck" branch based on affiliations (e.g., local community or specific clubs), potentially giving them an implicit advantage. This aligns with the description's "XOR choice" for cultural fit.

---

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model ensures a fair process by removing the XOR branching. All applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation after the skill assessment, eliminating any selective advantages based on affiliations.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCheck = Transition(label="DataCheck")  # Resume parsing and initial check
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")  # Request additional details if incomplete
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")  # Preliminary skill-based assessment
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Uniform cultural fit evaluation for all applicants
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")  # Human review of candidates
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")  # Final hiring decision

# Define the loop for data completeness
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# No XOR; just a single cultural fit check

# Define the root partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add edges to define the order
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)  # Receive application before data check loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)  # Data check loop before skill assessment
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)  # Skill assessment before cultural fit check
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)  # Cultural fit check before managerial review
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)  # Managerial review before final decision

# The model is now ready; you can visualize or export it using pm4py functions if needed.
```

**Explanation of Fairness**: In this model, there is no XOR node, so all applicants proceed directly to "CulturalFitCheck" after "SkillAssessment". This ensures uniformity and removes the potential bias from community-based branching, while still maintaining the loop for data completeness and the overall sequential flow.

These models accurately reflect the hiring process described, with the first highlighting the source of potential unfairness and the second mitigating it. You can use `pm4py` visualization tools (e.g., `pm4py.visualization.powl.visualizer`) to render these models as graphs for better understanding.
