### Proposed High-Level Activity Grouping

| High-Level Activity          | Included Low-Level Events                                                                                                                                             | Rationale                                                                                                                      | Name of High-Level Activity     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Material Preparation**     | - Retrieve raw metal sheet<br>- Scan barcode<br>- Place metal sheet on table<br>- Align metal sheet<br>- Preheat metal sheet                                       | These steps collectively represent the preparation of the raw material before actual manufacturing occurs. Events happen in close sequence to ready the material physically and digitally (barcode scan) and ensure it's positioned and heated appropriately for the next steps. | Material Preparation           |
| **Assembly - Welding**       | - Pick up welding tool<br>- Weld corner A<br>- Weld corner B                                                                                                        | These events are logically linked as assembly tasks carried out sequentially by the same resource type (Operator B) using specific tools to join parts of the metal sheet. This step physically constructs the product component through welding. | Welding Assembly               |
| **Quality Inspection**       | - Measure weld integrity                                                                                                                                            | This event is a direct quality check on the welds just completed. It is performed by a quality sensor and verifies the integrity of the assembly before proceeding. This is a distinct verification task.                                          | Weld Quality Inspection       |
| **Coating Process**          | - Apply protective coating<br>- Dry coating                                                                                                                        | These events relate to applying and curing a protective coating after welding, performed by specialized units (Coating Unit, Heating Unit). They form a coherent stage focused on surface treatment and protection of the product.                | Protective Coating Process     |
| **Final Visual Check**       | - Visual check                                                                                                                                                      | This final step ensures the overall quality of the product visually, usually performed by an operator (Operator C). It serves as a last inspection stage before product completion or shipment.                                           | Final Visual Inspection        |

### Justification & Explanation

- **Temporal closeness:**  
  The low-level events within each high-level step occur sequentially and within a narrow time window (seconds to a minute), indicating they are part of a single coherent activity.

- **Resource Role & Function:**  
  Groupings reflect logical roles:
  - Material handling and preparation mostly involve Operator A and robotic units.
  - Welding and related assembly actions involve Operator B.
  - Quality checks and scanning involve sensors and quality assurance equipment.
  - Coating and drying are performed by specialized machines.
  - Final visual inspection is by an operator distinct from those handling earlier tasks.

- **Logical Process Flow:**  
  Each high-level activity represents an industrial process phase:
  - Preparing raw materials,
  - Joining components,
  - Checking assembly quality,
  - Protecting the product via coating,
  - Final visual quality approval.

- **Distinct Purpose & Outcome:**  
  Each group delivers a specific tangible outcome (prepared material, welded structure, verified welds, coated product, inspection passed) essential in a manufacturing pipeline.
