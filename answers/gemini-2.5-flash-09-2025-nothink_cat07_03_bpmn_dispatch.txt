This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process of dispatching goods, likely from a computer hardware shop.

The process is organized into three distinct swimlanes, representing the roles or departments involved:

1.  **Logistics** (Top Lane)
2.  **Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop / Secretary** (Middle Lane)
3.  **Warehouse** (Bottom Lane)

The process starts with the **"Ship goods"** Start Event (circle).

### Flow Breakdown:

**1. Parallel Start (Dispatch and Warehouse)**
The initial event leads to a Parallel Gateway (plus sign), splitting the flow into two main concurrent paths:

*   **Path A (Dispatch - Secretary):**
    *   **"Clarify shipment method"** task.
    *   This leads to an Exclusive Gateway (diamond with 'X') for a decision: **"Special handling?"**
        *   **If "yes" (Special handling):**
            *   **"Get 3 offers from logistic companies"** task.
            *   **"Select logistic company and place order"** task.
            *   The flow then merges into an Exclusive Merging Gateway.
        *   **If "no":**
            *   **"Check if insurance is required"** task, utilizing **"Customer information"** data store and referencing **"Order details"** document.
            *   This leads to an Inclusive Gateway (diamond with circle) for insurance decision: **"If insurance necessary"** (one possible path) or **"always"** (the second path).
                *   If insurance is necessary, the flow goes to the **Logistics** lane for the **"Insure parcel"** task.
                *   Regardless of insurance necessity, the flow also proceeds to the **"Write package label"** task in the Secretary lane.
            *   The flows from **"Insure parcel"** and **"Write package label"** merge at a Parallel Merging Gateway (plus sign) and then continue to the Exclusive Merging Gateway mentioned above.

*   **Path B (Warehouse):**
    *   **"Package goods"** task.
    *   This task is followed by a Time-based Intermediate Event (circle with a clock) set to **"48 hours"**.
    *   If the time limit is reached, the flow goes to the **"Notify customer about delay"** task.
    *   Both the successful completion of "Package goods" (within 48 hours) and the completion of "Notify customer about delay" merge at an Inclusive Merging Gateway (diamond with circle).

**2. Synchronization and Completion**
*   The output of the Secretary lane (after selecting logistics) and the output of the Warehouse lane (after packaging/delay notification) both lead into a final **Parallel Merging Gateway** (plus sign). This ensures that both the administrative and physical preparation steps are completed before proceeding.
*   The synchronized flow then continues in the Warehouse lane:
    *   **"Fill out Shipment paperwork"** task.
    *   **"Move package to pickup area"** task.
*   The process concludes with the **"Shipment prepared"** End Event (thick-lined circle).
