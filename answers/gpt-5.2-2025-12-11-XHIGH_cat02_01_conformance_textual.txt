### Normative (“intended”) variants implied by the text

- **Fulfillment path (inventory sufficient):**  
  **Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order**
- **Cancellation path (inventory insufficient):**  
  **Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order**

Key rules the text makes explicit:
- **“Check inventory” must happen before** any payment/fulfillment decision (authorize/package/ship/cancel).
- **“Authorize payment” must be after “Check inventory” and before “Package items.”**
- **“Package items” must be before “Ship order.”**
- **After “Cancel order,” no fulfillment activities (package/ship) should occur; next should be “Close order.”**
- **“Close order” is always the final activity.**

## 1) Cases that violate the normative process
**Violating cases:** **2, 3, 5**  
**Conforming cases:** **1, 4**

---

## 2) Explanation of violations (by case)

### Case 2
Trace: Receive  Check  **Package**  **Authorize**  Ship  Close  
**Violations:**
- **Packaging before payment authorization.** The description states authorization should occur **before** packaging (“‘Package items’ should only occur after authorization…”).  
So Case 2 breaks the required order: **Authorize payment  Package items**.

---

### Case 3
Trace: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel**  **Ship**  Close  
**Violations:**
- **Shipping after cancellation.** The text explicitly says shipping should **never** occur after a cancellation, and after cancel the process should go to **Close order**.  
- **Cancellation branch is not followed.** If “Cancel order” happens, the normative sequence is **Check  Cancel  Close**, with no further fulfillment actions.
- Additionally, **Ship order occurs without “Package items”** in this case, violating the rule that shipping must be preceded by packaging.

(Regardless of why it was canceled, the **post-cancel shipping** is clearly “illogical” per the description.)

---

### Case 5
Trace: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship**  Close  
**Violations:**
- **Missing “Package items” before shipping.** The text states items should be packaged before they are shipped (“‘Package items’ … before shipping”).  
So Case 5 violates the required precedence: **Package items  Ship order** (and effectively skips a required step on the fulfillment path).

---

### Cases 1 and 4 (for completeness)
- **Case 1** exactly matches the fulfillment path.
- **Case 4** exactly matches the cancellation path.
