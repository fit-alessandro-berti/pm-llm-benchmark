We need to examine each case for deviations from typical P2P flow: standard order: Create Requisition -> Approve Requisition -> Issue PO -> Receive Goods -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Match Invoice to PO (three-way match) -> Release Payment -> Close Case. Some variations allowed: invoice may arrive before goods (but then must be matched after goods). Also approval must happen before PO issuance. Payment should not be before goods receipt and invoice match.

Let's analyze each case.

Case 1001: follows correct order. No anomaly.

Case 1002: Sequence: Create Requisition, Issue PO (without approval), then Invoice Received, Release Payment, then Approve Requisition, then Receive Goods, then Match Invoice to PO, then Close. Issues: PO issued before requisition approval (violates control). Payment released before goods receipt and before matching invoice to PO. Also approval after payment is odd. So multiple anomalies.

Case 1003: Sequence: Create, Approve, Issue PO, then Release Payment (before invoice, before goods). Then Invoice Received after payment, then Receive Goods, then Match, then Close. Anomalies: payment before invoice and goods receipt; invoice after payment; goods receipt after payment. Also match after goods receipt but after payment already done.

Case 1004: Sequence: Create, Approve, Receive Goods, Issue PO (goods before PO), then Invoice Received, Match, Release Payment, Close. Anomalies: receiving goods before PO issuance (breaks control, could be unauthorized purchase). Also PO after goods may cause mismatches.

Also note timestamps: In case 1004, Receive Goods at 09:00, Issue PO at 09:15 same day, close next day. So goods before PO.

Potential other anomalies: In case 1002, invoice received before PO issuance? Actually PO issued before invoice, but approval missing. Also invoice received before goods receipt (common but okay). However payment before goods receipt is problematic.

We should explain why each is problematic: control, fraud risk, financial exposure, compliance.

Also note that case 1002 has invoice received before PO? Actually PO issued at 08:40, invoice at 07:00 next day, okay.

We can also mention that case 1002's timestamps show payment at 07:15 same day as invoice, before approval (08:00). So payment before approval.

We can summarize anomalies.

We should format answer with bullet points per case, explain each anomaly, and why problematic.

Also mention that case 1001 is normal.

Potentially also note that case 1003's payment before invoice is impossible; maybe system error.

We can also discuss that three-way match (PO, receipt, invoice) should happen before payment; not satisfied.

Thus answer.

We need to follow formatting rules: Use LaTeX for math if needed, but not needed. Use code formatting if needed, but not needed.

Proceed to final.

**Summary of Findings**

| Case | Anomalous steps (chronological order) | Why it is a problem |
|------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **1001** | – – – (no deviation) | This case follows the textbook Procure‑to‑Pay (P2P) flow and is therefore **not anomalous**. |
| **1002** | 1. *Issue Purchase Order* **before** *Approve Purchase Requisition*  <br>2. *Release Payment* **before** *Receive Goods* and **before** *Match Invoice to PO*  <br>3. *Approve Purchase Requisition* **after** payment | • **Control breach** – a PO should never be created without a prior approved requisition; the lack of approval removes a key segregation‑of‑duties check. <br>• **Financial risk** – paying before the goods are received and before the three‑way match (PO ↔ receipt ↔ invoice) exposes the organization to over‑payment, duplicate payment, or paying for undelivered items. <br>• **Audit trail inconsistency** – approving the requisition after payment defeats the purpose of the approval step and would be flagged in any compliance audit. |
| **1003** | 1. *Release Payment* **before** *Vendor Invoice Received* and *Receive Goods*  <br>2. *Vendor Invoice Received* **after** payment  <br>3. *Match Invoice to PO* **after** payment | • **Impossible sequence** – a payment cannot be released without an invoice; this suggests a data‑entry error or a bypass of the invoice‑validation control. <br>• **Missing three‑way match** – the invoice‑to‑PO match should precede payment; doing it afterwards defeats the purpose of the match (detecting quantity/price discrepancies). <br>• **Potential fraud** – paying before the goods are received opens the door to paying for non‑existent deliveries. |
| **1004** | 1. *Receive Goods* **before** *Issue Purchase Order*  <br>2. *Issue Purchase Order* **after** goods receipt | • **Unauthorized receipt** – receiving items before a PO exists bypasses the procurement approval process; the organization may accept unsolicited deliveries, leading to inventory of unwanted or overpriced goods. <br>• **Control weakness** – the PO is the primary contract document; creating it after receipt makes it difficult to verify that the received quantity/price matches the originally intended purchase. <br>• **Risk of mismatched data** – the subsequent three‑way match may fail or be forced, increasing the chance of errors or intentional manipulation. |

### Detailed Explanation of Each Anomaly

#### 1. **Missing or Out‑of‑Order Requisition Approval (Cases 1002 & 1004)**
- **Standard practice:** A purchase requisition must be reviewed and approved before a purchase order (PO) is generated. This step provides budgetary control and ensures that the request aligns with policy.
- **What happened:**  
  - *Case 1002*: PO was issued **8 minutes** after the requisition was created, but the approval arrived **nearly a day later**.  
  - *Case 1004*: Goods were received **before** any PO existed, and the PO was only created **15 minutes** later.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Segregation of duties** is broken – the same actor (or a colluding group) can request, order, and receive without independent checks.  
  - **Budget overruns** can occur because the finance team may not have seen the request before funds are committed.  
  - **Audit red flags** – most internal‑control frameworks (e.g., COSO, SOX) require documented approval prior to commitment.

#### 2. **Payment Before Goods Receipt / Invoice Match (Cases 1002, 1003, 1004)**
- **Standard practice:** Payment is released **after** a three‑way match: PO ↔ Goods Receipt ↔ Vendor Invoice. This ensures that the organization pays only for what was ordered, received, and invoiced at the agreed price.
- **What happened:**  
  - *Case 1002*: Payment was released **30 minutes** after the invoice arrived, **before** the goods were received (which happened the next day) and **before** the match step.  
  - *Case 1003*: Payment was released **four days** after the PO but **before** the invoice and receipt.  
  - *Case 1004*: Payment followed the match, but the match itself was based on a PO that was created **after** the goods were already in the warehouse, weakening the reliability of the match.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Over‑payment risk** – the organization may pay for items that were never delivered or were delivered in a different quantity/price.  
  - **Fraud exposure** – a rogue employee could create a fake invoice, trigger payment, and disappear before the error is discovered.  
  - **Cash‑flow distortion** – paying early ties up working‑capital unnecessarily.

#### 3. **Invoice Received After Payment (Case 1003)**
- **Standard practice:** An invoice must be **received** before it can be matched and before payment is authorized.
- **What happened:** The system shows the invoice timestamp **after** the payment timestamp.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Data integrity issue** – either timestamps are wrong (indicating a logging problem) or the process was bypassed.  
  - **Compliance concern** – regulators and auditors expect a documented invoice trail; missing invoices at the time of payment can be deemed non‑compliant.

#### 4. **Goods Received Before PO (Case 1004)**
- **Standard practice:** A PO is the contractual authorization for the supplier to ship goods. Receiving goods without a PO means the organization has no formal agreement on price, quantity, or delivery terms.
- **What happened:** Goods were logged at **09:00**, PO at **09:15** on the same day.
- **Implications:**  
  - **Uncontrolled inventory** – the company may end up storing items it never intended to buy.  
  - **Pricing disputes** – without a PO, the supplier could later claim a higher price, leading to costly negotiations or legal disputes.  
  - **Audit red flag** – many internal‑control checklists flag “receipt before PO” as a high‑risk event.

### Overall Risk Assessment

- **Case 1001** – **Low risk** (process adheres to best‑practice flow).  
- **Cases 1002, 1003, 1004** – **High risk** due to multiple control violations (approval bypass, premature payment, receipt before PO). These cases should be investigated for:
  1. **System or data‑entry errors** (e.g., incorrect timestamps).  
  2. **Process exceptions** that were not formally documented.  
  3. **Potential fraud or collusion** among requestors, approvers, and payers.

**Recommended actions**

1. **Root‑cause analysis** on the three anomalous cases (review logs, interview participants).  
2. **Enforce mandatory validation rules** in the workflow engine:  
   - PO creation **requires** a prior approved requisition.  
   - Payment task **blocked** until receipt, invoice, and three‑way match are completed.  
3. **Implement audit alerts** for any of the following patterns:  
   - `Issue PO → Release Payment` without intervening `Approve Requisition`.  
   - `Release Payment` occurring **before** `Receive Goods` or `Match Invoice to PO`.  
   - `Receive Goods` occurring **before** `Issue PO`.  
4. **Periodic compliance reporting** to senior management to monitor recurrence.

By addressing these anomalies, the organization can restore the integrity of its Procure‑to‑Pay process, reduce financial exposure, and satisfy internal‑control and regulatory requirements.
