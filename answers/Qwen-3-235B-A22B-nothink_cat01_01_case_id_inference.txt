To group these events into **cases** (i.e., individual patient journeys), we need to identify sequences of events that logically belong to the same **patient**. Since there is no explicit `case_id` or `patient_id`, we must infer grouping based on:

- **Timestamp order**
- **Patient attributes** (`patient_age`, `patient_gender`)
- **Activity sequence logic** (e.g., registration  triage  doctor consultation  discharge)
- **Department flow logic**
- **Additional information** (e.g., followup, diagnosis, etc.)

---

###  Key Observations:

1. Each patient typically follows a **sequence** of activities:
   - Registration  Triage  Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Tests (X-ray / Lab)  Results  Discharge (or Surgery)

2. **Patient uniqueness** can be inferred from:
   - Combination of `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and sometimes `additional_info`.

3. **Same patient** will not appear in multiple departments simultaneously unless logically expected (e.g., surgery  recovery  discharge).

###  Step-by-step Grouping:

Let’s assign inferred `case_id`s to each event based on the above logic.

---

###  **Case 1**  
**Patient:** 45, Male  
**Path:**  
- ER registration  Triage  X-ray  Doctor consultation  Discharge  
**Events:**

1. `Register patient` (45, M)  
4. `Initial triage` (45, M)  
7. `X-ray imaging` (45, M)  
12. `Doctor consultation` (45, M)  
15. `Patient discharged` (45, M)

---

###  **Case 2**  
**Patient:** 62, Female  
**Path:**  
- ER registration  Triage  Lab test requested  Lab test completed  Diagnosis  Prescription  Discharge  
**Events:**

2. `Register patient` (62, F)  
5. `Initial triage` (62, F)  
8. `Lab test requested` (62, F)  
10. `Lab test completed` (62, F)  
11. `Doctor consultation` (62, F)  
14. `Prescription created` (62, F)  
17. `Patient discharged` (62, F)

---

###  **Case 3**  
**Patient:** 28, Male  
**Path:**  
- Surgery registration  Consultation  Surgery prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge  
**Events:**

3. `Register patient` (28, M)  
6. `Doctor consultation` (28, M)  
9. `Surgery preparation` (28, M)  
13. `Surgery performed` (28, M)  
16. `Recovery room` (28, M)  
18. `Patient discharged` (28, M)

---

###  Final Case Groupings:

| Case ID | Events (Line Numbers) | Patient (Age, Gender) | Department Flow |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Case 1 | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15        | 45, Male               | ER  Radiology  ER |
| Case 2 | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17| 62, Female             | ER  Lab  ER     |
| Case 3 | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18    | 28, Male               | Surgery  OR  Recovery |

---

###  Conclusion:

We have identified **3 distinct cases** (patient journeys) from the interleaved log. Each case has a consistent sequence of events, matching patient demographics and logical workflow.
