Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the existing DECLARE model and then add new constraints to mitigate potential biases based on sensitive attributes. 

The given example model includes several keys corresponding to different DECLARE constraints. The main goal is to introduce constraints that ensure fairness in the loan application process. So, let's start by identifying where bias might occur.

Potential Bias Identification:
- For instance, a FinalDecision like "Reject" might happen more often after an activity related to sensitive attributes (e.g., CheckApplicantRace) without proper checks in between. This could lead to biased outcomes against minority applicants.
- Also, if there's a decision step specific to a sensitive group (Approve_Minority), maybe it should require a ManualReview to ensure fairness.

Now, thinking about the constraints needed:

1. Coexistence Constraints: If certain decisions involving sensitive attributes are made, they must coexist with ManualReview activities. For example, if "Reject_Minority" occurs in a trace, then "ManualReview" should also be present. So adding coexistence entries where these decision steps require ManualReview.

2. Response or Succession Constraints: To prevent a biased sequence like CheckApplicantRace -> Reject without an intermediate check. We can use response constraints that say if CheckApplicantRace occurs, there must be a BiasMitigationCheck before any decision (Approve/Reject). Alternatively, succession could enforce that after CheckApplicantRace, the next step isn't a decision unless BiasMitigationCheck happens first.

3. Non-succession Constraints: Directly preventing sensitive attribute events leading to decisions without checks. For example, noncoexistence or nonsuccession between CheckApplicantRace and Reject would stop them from occurring in succession.

Looking at DECLARE's binary constraints:

- coexistence: If activity A is present, B must also be present.
