The picture is composed of three small diagrams that together illustrate how a “Lab-visit” process instance cooperates with one or more “Lab-test” process instances.

1. Part (a) – Two proclet classes that talk to each other  
   • The lefthand net is the proclet class Lab visit (doctor / lab-assistant swim-lanes).  
     – It starts with Order entry, continues with Take blood sample, then waits for a result.  
     – After the result is received the activity Judge results decides:
       - green branch “Everything is fine”  Send report  end, or  
       - lower branch Do tests again  Receive updated result  Send report  end.  
   • The righthand net is the proclet class Lab test (chemical-analyst swim-lane).  
     – It begins with Perform test, then Make report, reaches Finish lab test and ends, or  
     – If a retest is requested it executes Perform test again  Provide updated report  end.  
   • The two proclets exchange messages through two dashed “channels”:  
     – Order system (upper dashed rectangle) is used to create a lab-test instance and to send the first test report (arcs numbered 1.1, 1.3).  
     – HIS (Hospital Information System – lower dashed rectangle) is used when additional tests are required and when the updated report is returned (arcs 1.4, 1.7 etc.).  
   • Solid arcs are normal control-flow; dashed arcs labelled 1.x are message flows that cross the proclet boundary.

2. Part (b) – Simple class diagram  
   A UML class diagram shows that a Lab visit “requires” one-to-many Lab tests (multiplicity 1..*).

3. Part (c) – Example of one performative (message)  
   The table shows what an individual message looks like:
   Time: 11:00  
   Channel: Order system  
   Sender: Lab visit – John  
   Receivers: Lab test – HGB John  
   Action: Create  
   Content: “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”  
   Scope: Private  
   Direction: OUT

In short, the visualization demonstrates how two object-aware process classes (proclets) are related in the data model, how their internal control-flow is designed, and how concrete messages (performatives) travel over two different communication channels to synchronise the activities carried out during a patient’s lab visit.
