Below is a practical, data-driven plan to diagnose and improve the fulfillment process with a focus on instance-spanning constraints (ISCs). The approach combines inter-case process mining, queue analytics, and simulation to design and validate interventions.

1) Identify instance-spanning constraints and quantify their impact

A. Preparation: enrich the event log to make ISCs explicit
- Reconstruct “ready-to-start” timestamps per activity:
  - Packing ready = Item Picking COMPLETE
  - Quality Check (QC) ready = Packing COMPLETE
  - Shipping Label Generation (SLG) ready = QC COMPLETE
- Add queue intervals:
  - For each activity A, queue_enter = ready(A); queue_leave = start(A); queue_wait(A) = start(A)  ready(A)
- Resource timelines:
  - For each station and staff, build a timeline from START to COMPLETE; mark availability, busy, setup/idle periods
- Batch objects:
  - Create batch entities from “Resource = System (Batch Bx)” and Destination Region
  - For each batch: batch_open = min ready(SLG) among members; batch_close = batch’s SLG timestamp; each order’s batch_wait = start(SLG)  ready(SLG)
- Hazard gate state:
  - Compute H(t) = number of hazardous orders concurrently in Packing or QC (START to COMPLETE intervals); mark intervals where H(t)  10 as “hazard gate closed”
- Cold-packing pool:
  - Identify cold stations (e.g., C1..C5), standard stations (S1..Sx), and build utilization/queue series separately

B. Quantify each ISC

1. Shared Cold-Packing (limited cold stations)
- Metrics:
  - Cold queue wait: for orders with Requires Cold Packing = TRUE, queue_wait(Packing)
  - Cold station utilization per station and pooled: busy_time / open_time
  - Effective queue length over time: number of cold-ready orders waiting
  - Saturation share: percentage of time all cold stations were busy
  - Upstream blocking: time Picker-to-Packing buffers are full for cold orders (optional, if buffer modeled)
- Attribution logic (between-instance vs within-instance):
  - If at any time in [ready(Packing), start(Packing)] at least one cold station was idle, the wait is not due to cold resource contention; otherwise attribute to contention
  - If an express order starts on a cold station at a time a standard cold order is waiting and all cold stations are busy, classify the standard’s waiting increment as “priority-induced” (see Priority below)

2. Shipping batches (pre-SLG batching by region)
- Metrics:
  - Batch_wait(SLG) = start(SLG)  ready(SLG)
  - Batch fill time per batch: batch_close  batch_open
  - Batch size distribution; age of oldest order at batch close
  - Share of orders exceeding SLG wait threshold (e.g., >15 or >30 minutes) by region and time-of-day
- Attribution:
  - SLG waits are primarily between-instance (waiting for others in region) if the system would allow immediate SLG absent batch policy; if other technical delays exist, separate via system idle checks or logs

3. Priority handling (Express preempting Standard)
- Detect preemption and expedite effects:
  - For each station with capacity 1, if an Express START occurs while a Standard is running and the same station is assigned, flag a preemption; if the log does not show SUSPEND/RESUME, infer preemption if overlapping usage is impossible
  - Compare Standard activity durations with and without inferred preemption to estimate stretch (duration) and added queue waits to Standards behind the preempted job
  - Compare Express queue waits vs Standard queue waits for each step; measure expedite benefit to Express and cost to Standard
- Metrics:
  - Number of preemptions per day per station pool
  - Added delay to Standards: sum of extended queue_wait and service stretch linked to preemptions
  - Express SLA improvement: reduction in queue_wait(Packing/QC) vs baseline

4. Hazardous materials concurrency limit (cap = 10 across Packing and QC)
- Metrics:
  - Hazard gate binding time: share of time H(t)  10
  - Hazard orders’ gate wait at Packing/QC: portion of queue_wait attributable to the cap
  - Incidents where resources idle but H(t) = 10 (lost capacity due to regulation)
  - Throughput reduction estimate: difference between observed hazard start rate and potential start rate when H(t) < 10 (use counterfactual via DES or constrained queue model)
- Attribution:
  - If at any t in [ready(A), start(A)] there is an available resource for A but H(t)  10, tag the wait as “hazard-cap-induced”
  - Remaining wait in that interval is resource-induced or priority-induced depending on station busy state and Express arrivals

C. Distinguishing within-instance vs between-instance waiting
- Within-instance: delays due to the case’s own activity work (service time, rework inside the activity). They appear between START and COMPLETE.
- Between-instance: delays before START (queue_wait). Split queue_wait by cause based on environment state over time:
  - Resource contention: all qualified resources busy
  - Priority displacement: a lower-priority case waits longer because a higher-priority case starts earlier on the shared resource; detect by station busy with Express while Standard waits
  - Batch wait: SLG waits attributable to batch closure rule
  - Hazard cap: H(t)  10 prevents start while resources exist

Key roll-up metrics
- ISC wait share per activity = sum(queue_wait attributed to ISC) / sum(total waiting)
- P90/P95 of queue_wait per ISC and per segment (time-of-day, weekday, region)
- Cold station saturation share; hazard gate binding share
- Preemption count and Standard penalty minutes
- On-time ship percentage vs SLA; end-to-end lead time percentiles


2) Analyze interactions between constraints

- Express × Cold-packing:
  - Express cold orders may preempt standards at scarce cold stations, spiking Standard queue and increasing cold station setup/changeovers if different handling is needed
- Express × Hazard cap:
  - An express hazardous order cannot bypass the cap; it can still preempt another hazardous order within the 10 active slots, potentially extending the time another hazardous job keeps a slot occupied (if preemption prolongs that job’s completion)
- Batching × Hazard cap:
  - If many hazardous orders to one region arrive, QC and Packing work may synchronize, quickly pushing H(t) to 10. Even after QC completes, hazardous orders might later batch together at SLG. Prolonged QC/Packing due to cap can delay batch formation, raising downstream SLG wait or causing last-minute rushes
- Cold-packing × Hazard cap:
  - Hazardous + cold orders concentrate on the cold pool; when H(t) nears 10, both cold and standard stations could be underused if starts are blocked. Clearing cold queues faster reduces cap binding duration
- Priority × Batching:
  - Expediting Express orders into SLG can cause early batch closures for small express-heavy batches or late closures if batch rules require minimum size; both can hurt utilization/lead time for standard orders in the same region

Why interactions matter
- Optimizing one constraint locally (e.g., aggressive preemption for Express) can worsen others (longer cold queues, more hazard-gate binding, increased SLG waits). A portfolio of rules must be tuned in tandem and validated via simulation to ensure global improvement.


3) Constraint-aware optimization strategies

Strategy A: Dynamic flexible capacity for Cold-Packing with guardrails
- Addresses: Cold-packing contention; indirectly reduces Hazard gate binding; mitigates Express-induced preemption pressure
- Changes:
  - Convert selected standard stations to “flex-cold” during predicted cold surges (e.g., top of each hour or when cold queue length  threshold Qc and expected wait > Tcold)
  - Cross-train staff; kit stations with mobile cold equipment
  - Add switch-over rules with setup cost/time; enforce minimum run length to avoid thrashing
  - Prioritize hazard+cold orders during flex periods to lower H(t) faster
- Data/analysis:
  - Forecast cold arrivals by hour and day (ARIMA/Prophet or gradient boosting using event log arrivals)
  - Determine thresholds (Qc, Tcold) and minimum run length via simulation to minimize E2E time while controlling changeover loss
- Expected outcomes:
  - Lower P90 cold queue waits; lower cold station saturation; shorter hazard-cap binding intervals; fewer express preemptions because capacity relieves pressure

Strategy B: Priority policy with “preemption budget” and smart protection windows
- Addresses: Priority-induced Standard delays; reduces service stretch and thrashing; keeps Express SLA
- Changes:
  - Use Weighted Shortest Expected Processing Time (WSEPT) with class weights (Express > Standard) at station dispatch
  - Allow preemption only if remaining time of the running job >  (e.g., >3 minutes) to protect near-complete tasks
  - Cap preemptions per station per hour (preemption budget) and trigger only when Express predicted delay would breach SLA
  - Age-based promotion for Standards (if waiting > Tmax, temporarily increase their weight), preventing starvation
- Data/analysis:
  - Estimate activity service-time distributions conditioned on item type, station, order attributes
  - Train a simple SLA breach predictor for Express waits; use it to decide preemptions
- Expected outcomes:
  - Maintain/improve Express timeliness with fewer harmful interruptions; reduce Standard delay minutes; fewer long-tails in activity durations due to preemption

Strategy C: Dynamic batch formation with dual triggers (size or max-wait) and scheduled closes by region
- Addresses: SLG batch waits; balances routing efficiency vs timeliness
- Changes:
  - Define per-region batch rules:
    - Close batch when either size  Smax or oldest-ready-in-batch wait  Wmax
    - Align batch closing times with truck departures or wave schedules
  - Implement micro-batching off-peak: smaller batches to prevent excessive SLG wait; larger batches during peak if wait remains under Wmax
  - Pre-assign orders to a prospective batch upon QC COMPLETE to reduce last-minute contention; allow dynamic migration before close if regions consolidate
- Data/analysis:
  - Use historical arrival patterns to tune Smax, Wmax per region and time-of-day; simulate shipping cost vs lead-time trade-offs
- Expected outcomes:
  - Lower P90 batch_wait; improved on-time shipments; controlled increase in route cost with business-acceptable ROI

Strategy D: Hazard-constrained release and appointment windows (CONWIP-like control)
- Addresses: Hazard-cap binding; resource idleness during gate closures
- Changes:
  - Introduce a hazard “release controller”: only release hazardous orders to Packing/QC when H(t) < 10  buffer_b (e.g., buffer 2), smoothing starts over time
  - Optional: schedule fixed hazard windows per hour where a subset of stations focus on hazardous jobs to drain backlog quickly and predictably
  - When H(t) is near 10, prioritize completing shortest hazardous jobs (SPT within hazardous class) to free slots; route non-hazard tasks to keep stations productive
- Data/analysis:
  - Compute hazard gate binding heatmaps by time-of-day; tune buffer_b and window lengths via simulation to minimize gate binding without hurting throughput
- Expected outcomes:
  - Reduced periods of H(t) = 10; fewer instances of idle resources due to regulation; smoother flow through Packing/QC

Strategy E: WIP control and decoupling buffers where beneficial
- Addresses: Global flow; constrains variability compounding across ISCs
- Changes:
  - Set WIP caps between steps (e.g., limit number of cold-ready orders in buffer to reduce burstiness); dynamically throttle start of Item Picking for orders likely to hit constrained steps at peak
  - Pre-stage shipping label data earlier where possible (without printing) to shorten SLG processing time at batch close
- Data/analysis:
  - Little’s Law to size buffers; queue predictions to time releases; correlation analyses to see how upstream bursts impact downstream ISC binding
- Expected outcomes:
  - Lower variability in queues; more predictable lead times; better adherence to regulation while increasing throughput


4) Simulation and validation

A. Build a calibrated discrete-event simulation (DES)
- Model scope:
  - Activities: Picking, Packing (cold vs standard), QC, SLG
  - Resources: pickers; packing stations (cold, standard, flex-cold), QC staff, system for SLG
  - Policies: priority dispatching, preemption rules, hazard gate (H(t)  10), batching rules, WIP controls, station switch-overs for flex-cold
- Calibration from event log:
  - Interarrival patterns by hour/day and segments (Express/Standard, region, cold/hazard flags)
  - Service-time distributions per activity/resource/station type, including setup/changeover times
  - No-show/off-shift calendars, breaks, and downtime if available
  - Preemption behavior inferred from the log
  - Batch arrival/join/close patterns to set initial parameters
- What-if scenarios:
  - Peak season arrival rates; different mixes of express/cold/hazard
  - Vary Smax/Wmax batch rules; test preemption thresholds and budgets; test flex-cold thresholds and run lengths; hazard window sizes/buffers
- KPI tracking in simulation:
  - End-to-end lead time percentiles; on-time ship rate
  - queue_wait by cause: resource, priority, batch, hazard gate
  - Cold station utilization and saturation; hazard gate binding share
  - Preemptions per hour; Standard penalty minutes
  - Costs: extra shipping cost due to batching changes; labor/setup overhead from flex-cold

B. Validation approach
- Baseline validation:
  - Ensure simulated KPIs for the “as-is” policy match historical KPIs within tolerance (e.g., ±5–10%)
- Policy comparison:
  - Apply paired-run replication to compare strategies; use confidence intervals to select parameter sets
- Constraint compliance:
  - Automated checks that H(t) never exceeds 10; preemption rules applied as designed; batch backlog and close timing realistic


5) Monitoring post-implementation

A. Core dashboards
- Flow and SLA
  - End-to-end lead time percentiles and on-time shipping rate, segmented by Order Type, Region, Cold/Hazard
  - Activity-level waiting times (P50/P90) and service times
- Resource and queue health
  - Cold station utilization and saturation share; average and P90 cold queue length and waits
  - Standard packing utilization; QC utilization; overtime usage
- Priority effects
  - Express vs Standard queue_wait per step
  - Preemption count per station/time-of-day; Standard penalty minutes and distribution
- Batching performance
  - Batch_wait per region; batch size and fill time distributions
  - Share of orders exceeding Wmax; cost vs timeliness overlay if available
- Hazard compliance and impact
  - H(t) timeline with periods at cap; hazard-induced wait minutes; instances of idle capacity during cap
  - Hazard job turnaround times vs non-hazard
- Constraint attribution
  - Stacked bars of total waiting time split by cause: resource, priority, batch, hazard

B. Alerts and control charts
- Alert if:
  - Cold station saturation > threshold X% for Y minutes
  - H(t) at cap for more than Z minutes in any 30-minute window
  - Preemptions exceed budget per hour
  - Region-level batch_wait exceeds Wmax for more than N orders
- Control charts for stability:
  - Queue length and wait-time control charts by step and by time-of-day
  - Weekly drift in service-time distributions; recalibrate when shifts detected

C. Continuous improvement loop
- Weekly parameter tuning:
  - Refit service-time and arrival models; re-evaluate thresholds (Qc, Tcold, , Smax/Wmax, hazard buffers)
- A/B or phased rollouts:
  - Compare cells adopting new policies vs control cells; monitor KPI deltas and compliance

Summary of expected outcomes
- Reduction in end-to-end lead time variance and P90/P95
- Higher on-time shipping, especially for Express, without disproportionate Standard penalties
- Lower cold queue waits and fewer periods of cold saturation
- Reduced hazard gate binding time and fewer idle-capacity incidents during cap
- Faster, more predictable batch closures with acceptable shipping cost trade-offs

This plan explicitly models and measures interdependencies among cases, attributes waiting to concrete instance-spanning causes, and uses targeted, validated policies to relieve bottlenecks while maintaining regulatory compliance.
