If you translate the code into a controlflow, the model you are analysing looks roughly like this:

- `Receive_Order` is always the first visible step.
- After that there is an XOR between `Check_Credit` and a silent transition, so the credit check can be skipped entirely.
- `Approve_Order` and `Issue_Invoice` are wrapped in a `LOOP`, so the process can cycle through those two tasks repeatedly before moving on.
- Once the loop is exited, `Receive_Payment` and `Close_Order` are executed in sequence.

In a “clean” ordertocash process you would expect a credit assessment for new or highrisk customers, a single approval followed by fulfilment and a single invoice before taking payment and closing the case. The two constructs in the POWL model break those expectations:

- Making `Check_Credit` optional via an XOR with a silent skip means an order can proceed straight to approval and invoicing without any risk assessment. In practice that undermines credit control and exposes the company to bad debt.
- The loop over `Approve_Order` and `Issue_Invoice` allows these steps to be executed multiple times. Depending on the loop semantics this could mean reapproving an already approved order or issuing multiple invoices for the same order. Either pattern points to rework, errors or attempts to work around system constraints, and can result in inefficiency, duplicate billing and audit/compliance issues.

Highlighting these deviations is important because they signal where the implemented process may not conform to policy, and where controls or redesign are needed to ensure a robust, efficient ordertocash cycle.
