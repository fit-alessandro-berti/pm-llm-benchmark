## 1. Queue Identification and Characterization

**Calculating Waiting Times (Queue Times):**  
Waiting time, or queue time, is defined as the elapsed time between the completion of one activity and the start of the subsequent activity in the patient journey. Using the event log, for each patient (by Visit ID), you can calculate the queue time between, for example, the completion of “Registration” and the start of “Nurse Assessment” by subtracting the “Registration–COMPLETE” timestamp from the “Nurse Assessment–START” timestamp[2][4]. This calculation is repeated for all pairs of consecutive activities.

**Key Metrics to Characterize Queues:**  
To gain meaningful insights, aggregate the calculated queue times per activity transition (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment) across all patient visits:
- Average waiting time per queue
- Median waiting time per queue
- 90th percentile waiting time (to identify outlier queues)
- Maximum waiting time
- Queue frequency (number of patients experiencing each queue)
- Number (and proportion) of cases with excessive waits (e.g., exceeding a desired threshold)
- Stratifications by patient type (New/Follow-up), urgency, time of day, and weekday/weekend

**Identifying the Most Critical Queues:**  
Critical queues merit immediate attention if they demonstrate:
- The longest average or 90th percentile waiting times
- The highest frequency (affecting the most patients)
- High impact on priority cohorts (e.g., urgent or new patients)
- Occurrence at process stages tightly linked to overall patient satisfaction (e.g., pre-doctor waiting)[3][5]
Prioritization can use a weighted scoring combining these factors to target queues that both affect many patients and cause the largest delays.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

**Potential Root Causes:**  
- *Resource Bottlenecks*: Insufficient staff or equipment capacity at bottleneck points (e.g., not enough nurses or examination rooms).
- *Activity Dependencies & Handovers*: Delays arising from inefficient handoffs between staff (e.g., waiting for a nurse to become available after registration).
- *Variability in Service Times*: Activities whose durations fluctuate widely, causing unpredictable downstream delays.
- *Scheduling & Arrival Patterns*: Poorly balanced appointments or surges in patient arrivals at certain times causing peaks in demand and idle resources at other times.
- *Patient Type/Urgency Differences*: New patients or urgent cases may experience disproportionate waits if not properly triaged or prioritized[5].

**Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Analysis:**  
- *Resource Analysis*: By correlating queue times with staff allocation from the event log (“Resource” column), process mining can reveal whether certain individuals, roles, or rooms consistently generate delays (e.g., always a queue before ‘Nurse 1’)[2][4].
- *Bottleneck and Throughput Analysis*: Process mining tools can visualize the “bottleneck” activities where most time accumulates and show if they migrate depending on the time of day or resource assignment.
- *Variant Analysis*: Analyzing different process variants (e.g., New vs. Follow-up patients) reveals if certain patient journeys are systematically slower.
- *Path Analysis*: Revealing detours, rework, or unnecessary steps within the flow that generate additional waiting or handoffs[2][5].

## 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Reallocation and Staff Scheduling**
- **Targeted Queues:** Activities with the largest or most frequent queues (e.g., Nurse Assessment, Doctor Consultation).
- **Root Cause Addressed:** Resource bottlenecks, uneven staff deployment during peak periods.
- **Supporting Data/Analysis:** Queue time peaks associated with time slots or particular resources; staff utilization rates.
- **Implementation:** Adjust staff schedules using event log insights—deploy more nurses or doctors during high-demand periods and reduce during low demand. If a particular examination room or staff member is a bottleneck, consider cross-training or redistributing workload.
- **Potential Impact:** Reduction in average waiting time for Nurse Assessment and Doctor Consultation by 20–40%, depending on reallocation scope.

**Strategy 2: Optimized Appointment Scheduling with Staggered/Buffer Slots**
- **Targeted Queues:** Registration and initial clinical assessments, particularly at start-of-day or post-lunch periods.
- **Root Cause Addressed:** Arrival pattern surges and rigid scheduling creating backlogs.
- **Supporting Data/Analysis:** Event log showing arrival spikes and consequent downstream bottlenecks. Identify excessive queues forming at consistent times.
- **Implementation:** Modify scheduling logic to stagger patient arrivals, add buffer slots, or implement a rolling registration process. Prioritize urgent and new patients dynamically.
- **Potential Impact:** Expected reduction in peak queues by 25–35%, contributing to smoother patient flow and reduced maximum waiting times.

**Strategy 3: Patient Self-Service and Parallelization of Front-End Processes**
- **Targeted Queues:** Registration, pre-assessment, diagnostic test prep[5].
- **Root Cause Addressed:** Manual, sequential processing (e.g., all patients must see a receptionist before moving on).
- **Supporting Data/Analysis:** Analysis shows long queues before resource-intensive activities.
- **Implementation:** Introduce self-service kiosks for registration, online pre-visit forms, or parallel processing for certain preliminary diagnostics (e.g., bloodwork before doctor consultation when applicable).
- **Potential Impact:** Registration waiting times can drop by 40–60%; earlier completion of front-end tasks enables subsequent activities to start on time[5].

## 4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

- **Shifted Bottlenecks:** Alleviating one queue may transfer delays downstream (e.g., faster registration creating a backlog for nurse assessments).
- **Increased Operational Costs:** Hiring more staff or extending hours has direct financial impact.
- **Staff Workload and Satisfaction:** More intense peak scheduling or cross-training can affect burnout and morale.
- **Care Quality Risks:** Speeding up processes must not come at the expense of thoroughness in assessment or documentation.
- **Patient Experience:** Some patients may prefer personal contact over technology, or struggle with self-service.

**Balancing Objectives:**  
Utilize simulations and continuous monitoring: pilot interventions, measure their effect, and iteratively readjust. Focus on interventions (like self-service) with high impact on efficiency and patient experience but minimal operational cost increases. Always check for unintended consequences downstream and gather feedback from both patients and staff[3][5].

## 5. Measuring Success

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- Average and median waiting times between key activities (overall and per activity pair)
- Maximum and 90th percentile waiting times
- Total visit duration (arrival to check-out)
- Proportion of visits exceeding acceptable waiting thresholds
- Patient satisfaction scores (via surveys)
- Staff utilization rates and overtime hours
- Number of complaints related to wait times

**Ongoing Process Monitoring:**  
Regularly extract and analyze updated event logs to track these KPIs. Use process mining dashboards to visualize improvements or identify regressions—enabling early detection of emerging bottlenecks. Periodically reassess process variants to ensure that changes benefit all patient types and do not inadvertently disadvantage subgroups[3][4][2].
