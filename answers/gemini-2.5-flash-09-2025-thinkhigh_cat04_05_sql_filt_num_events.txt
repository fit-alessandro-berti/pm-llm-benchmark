This task requires a two-step logic: first, grouping the data to calculate a statistic (the count of events) and filtering those groups (`HAVING`), and second, using the resulting filtered list of identifiers (`case_id`) to retrieve the full original data set.

Here are two effective SQL solutions to achieve this in DuckDB.

## Solution 1: Using a Subquery with `IN`

This is generally the most straightforward and standard SQL approach. The subquery identifies the valid `case_id`s, and the outer query retrieves all events associated with those IDs.

```sql
SELECT
    t1.case_id,
    t1.activity,
    t1.timestamp
FROM
    event_log AS t1
WHERE
    t1.case_id IN (
        -- Subquery: Identify only the case_ids that have 6 or fewer events
        SELECT
            case_id
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
        HAVING
            COUNT(*) <= 6
    );
```

## Solution 2: Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) and Window Function

This approach calculates the case size using a window function (`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`) and then filters based on that calculated size in the final step. This can often be highly performant in modern analytical databases like DuckDB as it avoids a separate scan or join.

```sql
WITH CaseStatistics AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        -- Calculate the total number of events for the current case_id
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS case_size
    FROM
        event_log
)
SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp
FROM
    CaseStatistics
WHERE
    case_size <= 6;
```
