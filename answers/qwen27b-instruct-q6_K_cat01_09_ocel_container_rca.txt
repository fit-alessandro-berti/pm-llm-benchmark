To identify the root causes for performance issues within this process, we should focus on analyzing the frequency of events (number of times an action occurs), duration of each event, and the flow between different actions. Here are some potential root cause analyses based on these details:

### 1. **High Frequency with Long Duration**

**"Reschedule Container"**
- *Frequency (events):* 38 (sum of all in/out connections)
- *Duration:* 907445.62
- **Reasoning:** A high frequency combined with a long duration suggests that rescheduling containers is occurring often and takes considerable time each instance, leading to inefficiency.

**"Order Empty Containers"**
- *Frequency (events):* 1138 (sum of all in/out connections)
- *Duration:* 1496421.57
- **Reasoning:** Ordering empty containers is a frequent but time-consuming activity. The long duration indicates potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in this step, possibly due to manual processes or high demand for container orders.

### 2. **Low Frequency with Long Duration**

**"Weigh"**
- *Frequency (events):* 3180
- *Duration:* Sum of all durations within "Weigh" connections
- **Reasoning:** Although weighing may be frequent in the context of inventory management, the long duration per action suggests there could be inefficiencies. This might be due to complex or manual weighing processes, equipment issues, or inaccuracies that require reweighing.

### 3. **Multiple In/Out Connections with High Duration**

**"Book Vehicles"**
- *Frequency (events):* 26
- *Duration:* Sum of all durations within "Book Vehicles" connections
- **Reasoning:** Although not as frequent, the high duration indicates that booking vehicles is a significant time-consuming process. Potential issues could be related to resource allocation, scheduling constraints, or complex logistics planning.

### 4. **In/Out Connections with High Frequency**

**"Load to Vehicle"**
- *Frequency (events):* 1265
- **Reasoning:** Frequent loading actions suggest that the loading process is critical and high-volume. Efficiency in this area could improve throughput by optimizing load/unload procedures, equipment utilization, or personnel workflow.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

**1. Streamlining "Reschedule Container" Process**
   - Automate container rescheduling to reduce manual intervention and errors.
   - Optimize resources (vehicles, staff) for more efficient scheduling.

**2. Enhance "Order Empty Containers" Efficiency**
   - Increase inventory levels or improve forecasting accuracy to reduce the frequency of orders.
   - Implement better logistics software for faster order processing.

**3. Improve "Weighing" Process**
   - Upgrade weighing equipment for speed and accuracy, reducing re-weighing needs.
   - Implement standard operating procedures (SOPs) to streamline weighing processes.

**4. Optimize "Book Vehicles" and "Load to Vehicle" Operations**
   - Use real-time data to dynamically adjust vehicle booking based on current demand and availability.
   - Improve load planning and staff training to maximize vehicle capacity utilization.

By focusing on these areas, significant improvements in process throughput and efficiency can be achieved by addressing bottlenecks and optimizing resource allocation.
