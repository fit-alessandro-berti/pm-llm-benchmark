To analyze the provided event log and determine which cases have significantly longer total resolution times, we will start by calculating the total time taken to resolve each ticket.

### Step 1: Calculate Resolution Times

We will compute the duration for each case from the "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket" events:

1. **Case 101**:
   - Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
   - End: 2024-03-01 10:15
   - Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes

2. **Case 102**:
   - Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
   - End: 2024-03-02 09:15
   - Duration: Over 1 day + 1 hour 10 minutes = 1 day, 1 hour, 10 minutes = 1450 minutes

3. **Case 103**:
   - Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
   - End: 2024-03-01 09:30
   - Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes

4. **Case 104**:
   - Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
   - End: 2024-03-02 08:30
   - Duration: 1 day + 30 minutes = 1 day, 30 minutes = 1500 minutes

5. **Case 105**:
   - Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
   - End: 2024-03-03 09:30
   - Duration: 2 days + 1 hour 30 minutes = 1,530 minutes

### Summary of Resolution Times
| Case ID | Total Resolution Time (in minutes) |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| 101     | 135                                 |
| 102     | 1450                                |
| 103     | 80                                  |
| 104     | 1500                                |
| 105     | 1530                                |

### Step 2: Identify Cases with Delays

The cases that exhibit significantly longer resolution times than others are:
- **Case 102**: 1450 minutes
- **Case 104**: 1500 minutes
- **Case 105**: 1530 minutes

### Step 3: Analyze Potential Root Causes

#### 3.1 Escalations
- **Case 102** and **Case 105** both experienced escalations to a Level-2 agent, suggesting that the issues were complex or require specialist knowledge. These escalations typically contribute to longer resolution times.

#### 3.2 Waiting Times
- **Case 102** shows a significant wait time before the investigation, as the ticket was escalated nearly 2 hours after assignment (from 09:00 to 11:30). Investigating it later (14:00) further elongates the resolution time.
- **Case 105** exhibits a similar problem where the ticket was escalated and not investigated until over 24 hours later (from 10:00 on 2024-03-01 to 14:00 the next day).

#### 3.3 Comparison with Other Cases
- Case 101, 103 show efficient handling without significant delays or escalations; both resolved in under 2 hours.

### Step 4: Recommendations

1. **Improved Triage Process**:
   - Increase the efficiency of the initial triage to better assess which tickets may need escalation and handle them swiftly if it seems complex and outside the Level-1 capability.

2. **Escalation Protocol**:
   - Establish a clearer protocol for timely escalations to ensure that cases needing urgent attention do not languish. This could include reducing wait times between assignment and escalation.

3. **Monitoring and Training**:
   - Regularly monitor tickets leading to escalations to identify patterns. Moreover, provide additional training to Level-1 agents on common complex issues that may arise, helping them to resolve more efficiently without immediate escalation.

4. **Automated Alerts**:
   - Implement a system of alerts that notify when a ticket takes too long at any given stage, prompting the intervention of a supervisor before delays become excessive.

By implementing these strategies, it is likely that the organization can decrease resolution times and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
