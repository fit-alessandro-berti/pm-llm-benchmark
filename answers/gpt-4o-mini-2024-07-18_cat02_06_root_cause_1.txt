To analyze the event log of the “Customer Support Ticket Resolution” process, we start by calculating the total resolution times for each case and identifying any discrepancies. 

### 1. Total Resolution Times:

We will calculate the time taken from receiving the ticket to closing the ticket for each case.

- **Case 101:**
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:00
  - Close: 2024-03-01 10:15
  - **Total Time:** 2 hours 15 minutes (135 minutes)

- **Case 102:**
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:05
  - Close: 2024-03-02 09:15
  - **Total Time:** 25 hours 10 minutes (1510 minutes)

- **Case 103:**
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:10
  - Close: 2024-03-01 09:30
  - **Total Time:** 1 hour 20 minutes (80 minutes)

- **Case 104:**
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:20
  - Close: 2024-03-02 08:30
  - **Total Time:** 24 hours 10 minutes (1450 minutes)

- **Case 105:**
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:25
  - Close: 2024-03-03 09:30
  - **Total Time:** 49 hours 5 minutes (2945 minutes)

### Summary of Resolution Times:
- **Case 101:** 135 minutes
- **Case 102:** 1510 minutes
- **Case 103:** 80 minutes
- **Case 104:** 1450 minutes
- **Case 105:** 2945 minutes

### Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times:
- **Case 105** and **Case 102** have significantly longer resolution times compared to others.
- Case 104 is also abnormally long but not as extreme as Cases 102 and 105.

### 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues:

#### **Case 102:**
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent:** The ticket was escalated from Level-1 to Level-2, indicating complex issues that likely required higher-level expertise, contributing to the longer resolution time.
- **Long Waiting Times:** There was a significant delay between the escalation (11:30) and the investigation (14:00), leading to an extensive wait before moving forward.

#### **Case 104:**
- **Long Waiting Time Between Assignments and Investigation:** There was almost a 4-hour wait from the assignment (09:30) to the investigation (13:00), which is unusual.
- **Resolution Over 24 Hours Later:** The resolution (08:00 the next day) still required further time, indicating that the ticket may not have been handled optimally.

#### **Case 105:**
- **Escalation Leading to Lengthy Investigation:** Similar to Case 102, Case 105 also had escalation delays with two separate investigation instances. The first investigation (09:10) didn’t lead to resolution until 14:00 the next day, showcasing possible confusion or ineffective triaging and handover.

### 3. Insights and Recommendations:

#### **Identified Factors Leading to Increased Cycle Times:**
- **Escalation Delays:** Elevating from Level-1 to Level-2 agents introduces delays, suggesting a lack of resolution capability at the initial level or complexity in the cases.
- **Excessive Waiting Times:** Long waits between key activities (e.g., assignment to investigation) can lead to considerable time lags in resolution.

#### **Recommendations:**
1. **Conduct Training for Level-1 Agents:** Ensure they have the tools and knowledge to resolve more issues without needing escalation, reducing delays in the workflow.
  
2. **Monitor and Address Escalation Patterns:** Regular analysis of tickets that get escalated could help identify common issues, potentially providing training or resources to triage better.
  
3. **Implement Escalation Protocols:** Establish better protocols and timelines for escalations to ensure swift transitions for complex cases.
  
4. **Automate Triage and Assignment Processes:** Utilize automated systems to ensure that tickets are promptly assigned to available agents at the correct skill level to reduce manual delays.

5. **Regular Review of Resolution Times and Team Feedback:** Have team meetings to discuss tricky cases to spot patterns and improve processes holistically.

By targeting these root causes, the overall efficiency of the customer support ticket resolution process can be improved significantly, enhancing customer satisfaction and team performance.
