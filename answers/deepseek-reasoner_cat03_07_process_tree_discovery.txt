The process tree that captures the main flow, optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation, and eventual approval, confirmation, and archival is:

```
-> (
    'RA',
    -> (
        'VF',
        -> (
            'AE',
            -> (
                X (
                    * (
                        -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ),
                        tau
                    ),
                    tau
                ),
                -> (
                    'AD',
                    -> ( 'SC', 'AC' )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

**Structure Breakdown:**
1. **Main Sequence (`->`):**  
   The process starts with `RA` (Receive Application) followed by a nested sequence.

2. **Validation and Assessment:**  
   After `RA`, `VF` (Validate Form) and `AE` (Assess Eligibility) execute sequentially.

3. **Optional Loop Handling (`X`):**  
   After `AE`, an exclusive choice (`X`) allows:
   - **Loop (`*`):**  
     Repeating `-> (RMI, VF)` (Request Missing Info followed by Validate Form). The loop can execute multiple times (each iteration must complete RMIVF) or exit via `tau`.
   - **Skip Loop (`tau`):**  
     Directly proceed without additional RMIs.

4. **Final Approval and Closure:**  
   After the loop decision, the process continues with `AD` (Approval Decision), then `SC` (Send Confirmation), and finally `AC` (Archive Case) in sequence.

This model accommodates cases with/without missing info loops while maintaining simplicity and alignment with the observed event log patterns.
