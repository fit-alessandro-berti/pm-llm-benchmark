   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification`: Record the notification.
   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty`: Add penalties.
   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment`: Payment after penalties are added.
   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection`: Send for collection if not paid.

3. **With Appeal to Prefecture**:
   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture`: Offender appeals to prefecture.
