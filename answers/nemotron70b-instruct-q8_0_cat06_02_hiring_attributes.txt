To identify potentially sensitive attributes related to fairness, we focus on attributes that could be associated with protected characteristics or groups as defined by various anti-discrimination laws and fairness principles. These typically include but are not limited to:

1. **Gender** (`case:gender`)
2. **Religious beliefs** (`case:religious`)
3. **National Origin/Citizenship** (`case:citizen`)

Attributes that could potentially be considered sensitive either directly or indirectly, depending on the context and jurisdiction, are:

4. **Language proficiency** (implied by `case:german speaking`): While not always considered a protected class by itself, language can sometimes intersect with national origin or ethnicity.

The following attributes are less likely to be considered directly sensitive for fairness in most contexts, but could potentially play a role in fairness assessments if they inadvertently correlate with protected characteristics:

5. **Resource** (`resource`): This attribute refers to the personnel or systems involved in the process. While not inherently sensitive, disparities in treatment based on this attribute might reflect systemic biases if, for example, certain resources are more frequently assigned to cases involving protected groups differently than others.

Attributes that are unlikely to be sensitive for fairness include:

- **Activity** (`activity` and `concept:name`): These describe the process steps.
- **Time-related attributes** (`start_timestamp`, `time`, `time:timestamp`): These relate to when activities were performed.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Context Matters:** The sensitivity of an attribute can significantly depend on the specific context, legal jurisdiction, and the nature of the process being analyzed.
- **Intersectionality:** Fairness issues might arise from combinations of attributes rather than single attributes in isolation. For example, how `case:german speaking` intersects with `case:citizen` could reveal fairness concerns not apparent when examining each attribute separately.
- **Emergent Biases:** Continuous monitoring is necessary as new biases can emerge from interactions between attributes or changes in the data distribution over time.

**Actionable Advice for Fairness Analysis:**

1. **Consult Legal Expertise:** Especially if operating in multiple jurisdictions, to ensure compliance with all relevant anti-discrimination laws.
2. **Analyze Attribute Intersections:** Examine fairness metrics across combinations of potentially sensitive attributes.
3. **Regularly Audit for Emergent Biases:** Schedule periodic reviews of your process data to catch any new disparities that might arise.
