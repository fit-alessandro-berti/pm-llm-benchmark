To identify potentially sensitive attributes related to fairness, we focus on characteristics that could be associated with protected groups or classes under various anti-discrimination laws and ethical fairness considerations. These typically include, but are not limited to:

1. **Gender**: Directly references biological/identity differences.
2. **Religious**: References beliefs or affiliations protected by law in many jurisdictions.
3. **Citizen**: Could imply nationality or immigration status, both sensitive for fairness.

The attribute **"German speaking"** might also be considered sensitive in certain contexts, especially when related to employment practices, as it could indirectly discriminate based on nationality or ethnicity. However, its sensitivity can vary depending on the context (e.g., a job requiring German language proficiency might justify its use).

Attributes that are **less likely** to be considered sensitive for fairness in this context include:

- **Activity**, **Concept:name**: These relate to process steps within the job application workflow.
- **Resource**: Refers to the person/system handling a step, not directly related to applicant characteristics.
- **Start_timestamp**, **Time**, **Time:timestamp**: These are temporal attributes used for process timing analysis.

**Sensitive Attribute Rationale in This Context:**

| **Attribute** | **Sensitive?** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| case:gender | **Yes** | Directly related to a protected characteristic. |
| case:religious | **Yes** | References beliefs, a protected characteristic. |
| case:citizen | **Yes** | Implies nationality/immigration status, sensitive in employment contexts. |
| case:german speaking | **Context-Dependent** | Potentially sensitive; justify based on job requirements or context. |
| Others (Activity, Concept:name, Resource, Time-related) | **No** | Not directly related to protected applicant characteristics. |
