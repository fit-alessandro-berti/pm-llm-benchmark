The user wants me to create a Python dictionary representing a "temporal profile" for a specific business process.

**1. Deconstruct the Request:**

*   **Core Concept:** Temporal Profile.
    *   It's a model of time *between* activities.
    *   It considers *all* pairs of activities in a trace, not just consecutive ones. The example `<A,B,C,D>` generating `(A,B)`, `(A,C)`, `(A,D)`, `(B,C)`, `(B,D)`, `(C,D)` is crucial.
    *   It's defined by `(average_time, standard_deviation)` for each pair.
    *   A deviation is defined as `time < (AVG - ZETA * STDEV)` or `time > (AVG + ZETA * STDEV)`. This part is context for *why* the profile is useful, but I don't need to calculate deviations myself. I just need to create the profile.

*   **Scenario:** A complex global supply chain for high-tech electronics.
    *   **Activities:** SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. I need to use these exact labels.
    *   **Process Flow:** The description implies a logical order: SS -> OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT -> AS. This is the "happy path" or the main sequence of events.
    *   **Factors influencing time:** supplier lead times, manufacturing complexity, testing thoroughness, packaging speed, distribution network efficiency. I need to make my time estimates reflect these factors.

*   **Task:**
    *   Produce a Python dictionary.
    *   Keys: tuples of activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`).
    *   Values: tuples of `(average_time, standard_deviation)`.
    *   The times should be in seconds. The example uses seconds (86400 = 1 day), so I should stick to that.
    *   The dictionary should be a "representative subset" of all possible pairs. It doesn't need to be exhaustive (which would be 10*9/2 = 45 pairs), but it should be "complex" and include non-consecutive pairs.
    *   I must *estimate* the times. The user explicitly says "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." This is my cue to be creative but logical.

**2. Strategy for Estimation:**

I'll break the process down into logical phases and estimate times for each step. Then I can derive the times for non-consecutive pairs by summing the intermediate steps.

*   **Phase 1: Procurement (SS -> OP -> RC -> QI)**
    *   `('SS', 'OP')`: Choosing a supplier is relatively quick, maybe a few days of internal meetings and evaluation. Let's say 3-5 days. Average: 4 days = 4 * 86400 = 345600s. Stdev: Maybe +/- 1 day = 86400s.
    *   `('OP', 'RC')`: This is the supplier lead time. For high-tech components, this can be long and variable. Let's say 2-4 weeks. Average: 3 weeks = 21 days = 21 * 86400 = 1814400s. Stdev: High variability, maybe +/- 5 days = 432000s.
    *   `('QI', 'RC')`: Wait, the order is RC then QI. So I need `('RC', 'QI')`. Receiving and then inspecting. Inspection might take a day or two. Average: 1.5 days = 129600s. Stdev: Low, maybe 0.5 day = 43200s.

*   **Phase 2: Manufacturing (QI -> CA -> PT)**
    *   `('QI', 'CA')`: Assembly starts after inspection. Let's assume it starts the next day. Average: 1 day = 86400s. Stdev: Low, 4 hours = 14400s.
    *   `('CA', 'PT')`: Assembly to testing. This depends on complexity. Let's say 2-3 days. Average: 2.5 days = 216000s. Stdev: Maybe 0.5 day = 43200s.
    *   `('PT', 'CA')`: No, it's CA -> PT.

*   **Phase 3: Post-Manufacturing (PT -> PK -> WS -> DT)**
    *   `('PT', 'PK')`: Testing passed, now packaging. Could be same-day or next-day. Average: 0.5 days = 43200s. Stdev: Low, 2 hours = 7200s.
    *   `('PK', 'WS')`: Packaged and moved to warehouse storage. Very fast. Average: 2 hours = 7200s. Stdev: Low, 1 hour = 3600s.
    *   `('WS', 'DT')`: This is the "wait for shipping" time. Could be waiting for a full truckload, a specific shipping schedule. Let's say 1-3 days. Average: 2 days = 172800s. Stdev: High, 1 day = 86400s.

*   **Phase 4: Post-Distribution (DT -> AS)**
    *   `('DT', 'AS')`: Time from shipping to the first support request. This is highly variable. Could be days, weeks, or months. Let's say average of 30 days. Average: 30 days = 2592000s. Stdev: Very high, maybe 15 days = 1296000s.

**3. Deriving Non-Consecutive Pairs (The "Complex" part):**

Now, I'll calculate the times for pairs that are separated by multiple steps. The average time is the sum of the average times of the intermediate steps. The standard deviation is a bit more complex (it's the square root of the sum of variances, assuming independence), but for this estimation task, I can just make a reasonable guess that the combined stdev will be larger than the individual ones. I'll just pick a value that seems plausible given the components.

*   `('SS', 'RC')`: SS->OP + OP->RC. Avg = 345600 + 1814400 = 2160000s (25 days). Stdev will be large, dominated by OP->RC. Let's say 432000s (5 days).
*   `('OP', 'QI')`: OP->RC + RC->QI. Avg = 1814400 + 129600 = 1944000s (22.5 days). Stdev: Still high, let's say 400000s.
*   `('RC', 'PT')`: RC->QI + QI->CA + CA->PT. Avg = 129600 + 86400 + 216000 = 432000s (5 days). Stdev: moderate, let's say 86400s (1 day).
*   `('CA', 'WS')`: CA->PT + PT->PK + PK->WS. Avg = 216000 + 43200 + 7200 = 266400s (about 3 days). Stdev: low-ish, maybe 50000s.
*   `('PT', 'DT')`: PT->PK + PK->WS + WS->DT. Avg = 43200 + 7200 + 172800 = 223200s (about 2.6 days). Stdev: dominated by WS->DT, so let's say 86400s (1 day).
*   `('OP', 'PT')`: OP->RC + RC->QI + QI->CA + CA->PT. Avg = 1814400 + 129600 + 86400 + 216000 = 2246400s (26 days). Stdev: large.
*   `('QI', 'DT')`: QI->CA + CA->PT + PT->PK + PK->WS + WS->DT. Avg = 86400 + 216000 + 43200 + 7200 + 172800 = 525600s (about 6 days). Stdev: moderate.

**4. Assembling the Dictionary:**

I will now select a good mix of consecutive and non-consecutive pairs to show I understood the prompt. I'll include the ones I just calculated. I will format it as a Python dictionary with comments explaining my reasoning in the final output. I'll make sure the keys are tuples and the values are tuples of two numbers. I will use seconds as the unit.

Let's review the required output format:
```python
{('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600), ('B', 'C'): (3600, 3600)}
```
My planned output structure matches this.

I'll write a brief intro, then present the dictionary. I'll add comments inside the Python code block to explain the logic for each pair, which adds value and shows my reasoning. This is a good practice for complex prompts.

Final check of the requirements:
*   Python dictionary: Yes.
*   Keys are tuples of activity labels: Yes.
*   Values are tuples of `(avg, stdev)`: Yes.
*   Times are estimated: Yes, based on the scenario description.
*   Representative subset: Yes, I'll pick about 10-12 pairs.
*   Includes non-consecutive pairs for complexity: Yes, e.g., `('SS', 'RC')`, `('OP', 'PT')`, `('QI', 'DT')`.
*   Uses the provided activity labels: Yes (SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS).

The plan is solid. I will now generate the final response.

Of course. Based on the described global supply chain process, here is a Python dictionary representing a plausible temporal profile. The times are estimated in seconds, reflecting the realistic delays and variabilities for each phase of the process.

The dictionary includes both consecutive and non-consecutive activity pairs to demonstrate the full scope of the temporal profile model.

```python

# All time values are in seconds.

temporal_profile = {
