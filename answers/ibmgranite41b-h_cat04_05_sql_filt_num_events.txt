**Draft Prompt for Benchmark:**

"Craft a DuckDB SQL query that filters out any 'cases' (identified by `case_id`) containing more than six associated events, returning only those event records from cases with six or fewer total events. The table includes columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`."

**DuckDB SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) AS per_case_events
WHERE COUNT(*) <= 6;
```

This query groups all events by `case_id`, counts the number of events in each group, and then filters to return only those rows where the count is six or less.
