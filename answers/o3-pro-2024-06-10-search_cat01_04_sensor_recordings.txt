Inferred activity labels for the 15 events (one complete cycle on Machine M1)

Phase A – Machine Idle / Setup  
• Events 1 – 3  
• Evidence: All sensor variables at (or very near) their baseline: temperature 20-21 °C, pressure 1 bar, vibration 0 Hz, material-flow 0 u/s, tool position 0 mm, very low power (< 0.5 kWh). This combination normally occurs while a station waits for the next job or is being homed.

Phase B – Cutting Metal  
• Events 4 – 6  
• Evidence:  
  – Sharp rise in temperature from 50  58 °C and vibration from 30  38 Hz (typical of a rotating saw, mill or laser-assist head engaging material).  
  – Material flow holds steady at 5 u/s, suggesting removal of chips (coolant or conveyor).  
  – Tool advances from 5  10 mm, exactly when vibration and energy (2  3 kWh) increase.  
  – Pressure only modestly higher (1  1.5 bar), consistent with coolant delivery rather than pneumatic operations.  
All of these signatures—rapid heating, high vibration, continuous chip/coolant flow—match a cutting/machining step.

Phase C – Assembling Parts  
• Events 7 – 8  
• Evidence: Temperature falls back to a moderate 40 °C and vibration drops to a low 10 Hz, but material flow is still present at 2 u/s (adhesive, screws, or small parts feed). Pressure climbs to 2 bar, implying pneumatic actuators or clamping. Tool jumps to 15 mm and stays there while energy remains at a steady 2 kWh. These steady-state, moderate-stress readings are typical for pick-and-place or fastening operations.

Phase D – Welding / Heat-Joining  
• Event 9  
• Evidence: A single, intense burst—temperature spikes to 80 °C, vibration leaps to 50 Hz, energy surges to 5 kWh—while material flow drops to 0 u/s (no chips or feeders active). The machine is still clamped at 2 bar and tool position holds 15 mm, indicating the parts remain fixed while a high-power process (spot-weld, laser weld, or brazing) is executed.

Phase E – Quality Inspection  
• Event 10  
• Evidence: Conditions quickly cool to 30 °C, pressure returns to 1 bar, vibration almost disappears (1 Hz), and no material flow occurs. Power draw falls to 1 kWh—enough for sensors, lights, or a vision system. This low-disturbance environment fits an inspection or measurement step.

Phase F – Packaging / Final Handling  
• Events 11 – 12  
• Evidence: Machine stays cool (25 °C) but vibration rises slightly to 5 Hz, material flow resumes at 1 u/s, and tool extends to 20 mm. Energy is 1.5–1.6 kWh, higher than inspection but far below cutting or welding. These signals suggest the manipulator moves finished parts onto a conveyor or into packaging material while a small feeder dispenses boxes or labels.

Phase G – Machine Idle / Reset  
• Events 13 – 15  
• Evidence: All sensors drift back to their original baselines (identical to Events 1 – 3). The cycle ends and the workstation is ready for the next job.

Summary mapping of events to activities
• Idle / Setup: 1, 2, 3  
• Cutting Metal: 4, 5, 6  
• Assembling Parts: 7, 8  
• Welding: 9  
• Quality Inspection: 10  
• Packaging: 11, 12  
• Idle / Reset: 13, 14, 15

This sequence (Idle  Cut  Assemble  Weld  Inspect  Package  Idle) is internally consistent with common discrete-manufacturing flows, and each assignment is backed by specific, interpretable shifts in temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy use.
