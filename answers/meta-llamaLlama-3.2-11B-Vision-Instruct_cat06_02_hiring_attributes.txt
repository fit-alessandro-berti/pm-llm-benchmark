The sensitive attributes for fairness in this process are:

* `case:citizen`
* `case:gender`
* `case:german speaking`
* `case:religious`

These attributes are potentially sensitive for fairness analysis because they could be used to discriminate against certain groups of individuals in the hiring process. In fairness analysis, these attributes are typically considered "sensitive" and are used to identify biases or disparities in the treatment of different groups.

For example, if the analysis reveals that candidates who are non-citizen, of a certain gender, do not speak German, or have a certain religious affiliation are disproportionately rejected at a certain stage of the process, it could indicate unfairness in the hiring process.

In contrast, attributes like `concept:name`, `resource`, and `time` are not typically considered sensitive for fairness analysis. They provide information about the activities, resources, and timestamps involved in the process, but do not reveal personal characteristics that could be used to discriminate against certain groups.
