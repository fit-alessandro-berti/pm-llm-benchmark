           - *Write package label* (**always**)
           - *Insure parcel* (in Logistics lane **if insurance necessary**)
         - These merge afterward.
     - The specialhandling or insurance/label paths then merge.
   - **Warehouse branch**
     - *Package goods*.
     - A **timer boundary event (48 hours)** can trigger *Notify customer about delay*.
     - Both paths merge.

3. A **parallel join** synchronizes the secretary/logistics work and warehouse work.
