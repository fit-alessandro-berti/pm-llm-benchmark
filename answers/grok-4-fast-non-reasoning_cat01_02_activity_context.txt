### Analysis of Recurring Activities

After reviewing the event log, I identified the following activities that appear multiple times within the same case:

- **Verify Documents**: Occurs twice in C001 and C003 (not in C002). The first instance is an initial check of provided documents. The second instance is a re-verification after additional documents or adjustments have been made.
- **Call Customer**: Occurs twice in C002 (once in C001 and C003). In all cases, the first call addresses an immediate issue (e.g., requesting docs, clarifying discrepancies, or summoning the customer). The second call (in C002) is a follow-up to confirm resolutions.
- **Other activities** (e.g., Initiate Request, Adjust Account, Approve Request) appear only once per case and do not require disambiguation.

These recurrences reflect the iterative nature of the support workflow, where initial actions may loop back based on customer input or internal fixes. No other activities recur within cases.

### Revised Event Log

Below is the revised event log with renamed activities. I retained the original structure and all columns except "Activity," which now uses disambiguated names. Timestamps, resources, and additional context remain unchanged for fidelity to the original log.

### Justification of Naming Choices

- **Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification / Re-Verify Documents**:
  - **Contextual Clues**: The first occurrence in C001 and C003 is always an upfront check (e.g., "Agent checks identity documents" or "Physical verification of ID"), right after request initiation. The second is explicitly a follow-up (e.g., "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided" or "Re-verify docs after account adjustment"), triggered by prior events like document submission or account changes. This rename highlights the sequential progression: initial vs. post-resolution verification. "Initial" emphasizes the starting point, while "Re-Verify" signals iteration without implying a full restart.

- **Call Customer  Initial Customer Call / Follow-Up Customer Call**:
  - **Contextual Clues**: The first occurrence in all cases (C001, C002, C003) addresses an emerging issue immediately after verification (e.g., requesting missing docs, clarifying discrepancies, or summoning the customer). In C002, the second call is distinctly confirmatory (e.g., "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made"), occurring after an adjustment. In C001 and C003, only one call occurs, so it's always "Initial." This rename captures the outbound, issue-driven nature ("Initial") versus resolution-oriented purpose ("Follow-Up"), using position in the sequence and explicit context like "outbound call" or "follow-up."

These names are concise, process-oriented, and derived directly from the additional context and event ordering, ensuring clarity for process mining or analysis while preserving the original workflow's intent. No changes were made to non-recurring activities, as they are unambiguous.
