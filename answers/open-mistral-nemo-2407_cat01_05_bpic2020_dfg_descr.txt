Based on the provided data, here's a description of the underlying process, which appears to be a workflow for handling declarations and payments, involving multiple roles: Employee, Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, and Supervisor. The process can be broken down into several main paths:

1. **Standard Approval Path:**
   - An Employee submits a declaration (frequency: 8202, performance: 99860.580).
   - The declaration is approved by the Administration (frequency: 5133, performance: 164330.770).
   - The declaration is then approved by the Budget Owner (frequency: 2820, performance: 163968.943) or goes directly to the Supervisor for final approval (frequency: 2788, performance: 247457.498).
   - Once final approved, the process moves to 'Request Payment' (frequency: 10038, performance: 273266.628).
   - The payment is then handled (frequency: 10037, performance: 308848.058).

2. **Rejection Paths:**
   - At various stages, declarations can be rejected and sent back to the Employee for resubmission or correction. This can happen due to issues with the declaration itself or missing information (frequency: 1536, performance: 81928.554 for 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' with rejections).
   - Rejections can also occur between different approvers, with the declaration being sent back to the previous approver or the Employee (e.g., 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR', frequency: 190, performance: 189435.458).
   - In some cases, rejections can occur due to missing information, with the declaration being sent back to the Employee (e.g., 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', frequency: 61, performance: 739639.869).

3. **Alternative Approval Paths:**
   - Some declarations can bypass the Budget Owner and go directly to the Supervisor for final approval (frequency: 674, performance: 163158.794 for 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR').
   - A Pre-Approver can also be involved in the process, approving declarations before they reach the Supervisor (frequency: 685, performance: 107260.731 for 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER').

4. **Special Cases:**
   - There are some unique transitions with low frequencies, such as 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' (frequency: 1, performance: 3.000) or 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment' (frequency: 1, performance: 1471681.000).

In summary, the process involves multiple approval stages, with opportunities for rejections and alternative paths, ultimately leading to a 'Request Payment' and the handling of that payment. The data provided includes frequencies and performances for each transition, indicating how often each step occurs and the time taken for each transition, respectively.
