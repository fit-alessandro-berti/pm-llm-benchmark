In the given event log, the following attributes could be sensitive for fairness:

1. case:gender: This attribute indicates the gender of the citizens. If the process is biased towards a particular gender, it might lead to unfair treatment or discrimination.
2. case:german speaking: This attribute indicates whether the citizen speaks German or not. If the process is biased towards German-speaking citizens, it could lead to unfair treatment of non-German speaking individuals.
3. case:private_insurance: This attribute indicates whether the citizen has private insurance or not. If the process favors those with private insurance, it might lead to unfair treatment of individuals without insurance.
4. case:underlying_condition: This attribute indicates whether the citizen has an underlying condition or not. If the process treats citizens with underlying conditions differently, it might lead to unfair treatment.
5. resource: This attribute indicates which resource (e.g., Doc. Low, Doc. Pro, Nurse 1, etc.) is involved in the process. If certain resources are more likely to be assigned to specific groups of citizens, it could lead to unfair treatment.

It is important to monitor these attributes to ensure that the process is fair and unbiased towards different groups of citizens.
