Sure, I can provide a basic example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process. Please note that this is a simplified version and may not cover all the complexities of a real-world Purchase-to-Pay process.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {'Order Placement', 'Goods Received'},
    'always_before': {
        ('Order Placement', 'Purchase Order Approval'),
        ('Goods Received', 'Invoice Receipt'),
        ('Purchase Order Approval', 'Goods Order Placed'),
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Authorization'),
        ('Goods Order Placed', 'Goods Shipped'),
        ('Payment Authorization', 'Payment Sent')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Purchase Order Approval', 'Goods Order Placed'),
        ('Goods Order Placed', 'Goods Shipped'),
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Authorization'),
        ('Payment Authorization', 'Payment Sent')
    },
    'never_together': {'Order Placement', 'Payment Sent'},
    'activ_freq': {'Order Placement': {1},
                   'Purchase Order Approval': {1},
                   'Goods Order Placed': {1},
                   'Goods Shipped': {1},
                   'Invoice Receipt': {1},
                   'Payment Authorization': {1},
                   'Payment Sent': {1}},
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Purchase Order Approval', 'Goods Order Placed'),
        ('Goods Order Placed', 'Goods Shipped'),
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Authorization'),
        ('Payment Authorization', 'Payment Sent')
    }
}
```

In this example, the process starts with 'Order Placement', which must always be followed by 'Purchase Order Approval'. After the goods are shipped, an invoice is received, and then the payment is authorized and sent. The 'never_together' constraint ensures that 'Order Placement' and 'Payment Sent' cannot occur at the same time, indicating that the payment is made after the order has been fulfilled. The 'activ_freq' constraint limits the number of occurrences of each activity, and the 'directly_follows' constraint specifies that certain activities must occur directly after others.
