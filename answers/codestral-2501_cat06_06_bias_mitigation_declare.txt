To mitigate bias in the loan application review process, we need to introduce constraints that ensure fairness and consistency, especially when dealing with sensitive attributes like `ApplicantAge`, `ApplicantGender`, and `ApplicantRace`. Below is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints added to address potential biases:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints:

1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - These activities ensure that the process includes steps to review and mitigate potential biases.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority` must coexist with `ManualReview`. This ensures that decisions involving sensitive applicants are reviewed manually to prevent biased outcomes.

3. **Response Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, and `CheckApplicantAge` must respond to `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that any check for sensitive attributes is followed by a bias mitigation check.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede `Approve` and `Reject`. This ensures that decisions are made only after a bias mitigation check has been performed.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, and `CheckApplicantAge` cannot directly succeed to `Reject`. This prevents immediate biased decisions based on sensitive attributes without proper checks.

By adding these constraints, we ensure that the process is fair and consistent, reducing the likelihood of biased decision-making based on sensitive attributes.
