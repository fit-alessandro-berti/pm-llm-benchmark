To solve for this, we need to identify cases where the sequence of activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' appears consecutively such that there is no other event for the same `case_id` in between these three activities. Additionally, the time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' should be more than 5 days for those cases. We need to exclude any events from such cases from the final result set.

This reasoning leads us to a few steps:

1. For each case, identify if there is a sequence where 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by 'Create Order' which in turn is followed by 'Confirm Order' with no other activities in between. This requires us to order events within each case based on their `timestamp`.
2. For such cases where this sequence exists, check if the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events is more than 5 days.
3. Return all events from cases where either:
   - The specified sequence does not appear consecutively.
   - The specified sequence appears consecutively, but the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is 5 days or less.

First, let us identify the ordered sequence of events within each `case_id`. We need to use window functions such as `LEAD` and `LAG` to check for the next and previous activities (and timestamps) based on the timestamp order.

#### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. For each `case_id`, order the events by `timestamp`.
2. Use `LEAD` function to get the next activity and its `timestamp` for each row ordered by `timestamp` within each `case_id`.
3. Similarly, use `LEAD` again to get the activity and `timestamp` two rows ahead for each row.
    
By using the `LEAD` function twice (once for the next row and once for the row after that), we can check if a row with `activity` equal to 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by a row where `activity` is 'Create Order' which is in turn followed by a row where `activity` is 'Confirm Order'. Additionally, if such a sequence is found, we need to check that the `timestamp` difference between 'Create Order' (second row in the sequence) and 'Confirm Order' (third row in the sequence) is more than 5 days.

Let us construct a query that identifies such cases where the described sequence appears consecutively and the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days:

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_num
    FROM
        event_log
),
event_sequence AS (
    SELECT
        oe1.case_id,
        oe1.activity AS activity1,
        oe1.timestamp AS timestamp1,
        oe2.row_num AS row_num2,
        oe2.activity AS activity2,
        oe2.timestamp AS timestamp2,
        oe3.row_num AS row_num3,
        oe3.activity AS activity3,
        oe3.timestamp AS timestamp3
    FROM
        ordered_events oe1
    JOIN
        ordered_events oe2
    ON
        oe1.case_id = oe2.case_id
        AND oe1.row_num = oe2.row_num - 1
    JOIN
        ordered_events oe3
    ON
        oe2.case_id = oe3.case_id
        AND oe2.row_num = oe3.row_num - 1
    WHERE
        oe1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND oe2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND oe3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM event_sequence
    WHERE timestamp3 - timestamp2 > INTERVAL 5 DAY
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
WHERE
    e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```

However, a more common and efficient way to solve this might be by using the `LEAD` window function. This allows us to check subsequent rows within a single row, which makes it a bit more compact:

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM
        event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered_events
    WHERE
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL 5 DAY
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
WHERE
    e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude);
```

#### Explanation:
1. `ordered_events` CTE uses `LEAD` to get the next activity and timestamp (`next_activity` and `next_timestamp`) and the one after that (`next_next_activity` and `next_next_timestamp`).
2. `cases_to_exclude` CTE filters the `ordered_events` to find rows where the activity sequence is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' in that order (i.e., `activity` is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', `next_activity` is 'Create Order', and `next_next_activity` is 'Confirm Order'). Additionally, it checks if the time between `next_timestamp` ('Create Order' event) and `next_next_timestamp` ('Confirm Order' event) is greater than 5 days.
3. The main query selects all events from `event_log` where `case_id` is not in the `cases_to_exclude` CTE.

This query should thus return all events from cases that do not have the defined activity sequence where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
