## POWL Models for GlobalTeq Solutions Hiring Process

Below are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. The first model includes a potential source of bias, while the second model removes this unfairness.

### Model 1: POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
standard_cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# XOR branching for cultural fit evaluation with potential bias
xor_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    standard_cultural_fit_check,
    community_affiliation_check
])

# Sequence of activities
receive_app = receive_application
data_check = data_completeness_check
skill_eval = skill_assessment
cultural_fit_eval = xor_cultural_fit
review = managerial_review
final_decision_act = final_decision

# Partial order
po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_check, skill_eval, cultural_fit_eval, review, final_decision_act])

# Add edges to represent the order of activities
po.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_check)
po.order.add_edge(data_check, skill_eval)
po.order.add_edge(skill_eval, cultural_fit_eval)
po.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_eval, review)
po.order.add_edge(review, final_decision_act)

print("POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:")
print(po.nodes)
print(po.order)
```

### Model 2: POWL Model Without Unfairness

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Sequence of activities without XOR branching for community affiliation
receive_app = receive_application
data_check = data_completeness_check
skill_eval = skill_assessment
cultural_fit_eval = cultural_fit_check
review = managerial_review
final_decision_act = final_decision

# Partial order
po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_check, skill_eval, cultural_fit_eval, review, final_decision_act])

# Add edges to represent the order of activities
po.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_check)
po.order.add_edge(data_check, skill_eval)
po.order.add_edge(skill_eval, cultural_fit_eval)
po.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_eval, review)
po.order.add_edge(review, final_decision_act)

print("\nPOWL Model Without Unfairness:")
print(po.nodes)
print(po.order)
```

## Explanation

In the first POWL model (`POWL Model with Potential Unfairness`), an XOR branching is introduced after the skill assessment. This allows applicants to either go through a standard cultural fit evaluation or a community affiliation check, which may give a subtle advantage to certain applicants.

In the second POWL model (`POWL Model Without Unfairness`), all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation process without any XOR branching or community affiliation checks, ensuring fairness in the hiring process.

The main difference between the two models lies in how they handle the cultural fit evaluation and community affiliation check:

-   **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**: Includes an XOR choice between a standard cultural fit evaluation and a community affiliation check. This may lead to biased decisions based on community affiliations or local residence.
-   **POWL Model Without Unfairness**: Does not include the XOR branching for community affiliation checks. Instead, all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, eliminating the potential source of bias.

By comparing these two models, we can see how the introduction of an XOR branching with community affiliation checks may lead to subtle unfairness in the hiring process. The second model provides a more fair and transparent approach by ensuring that all applicants are evaluated using the same criteria.
