To create a temporal profile of the legal fines and appeals process described in your data, we will consider each step as a node in the timeline with its corresponding frequency (how often it occurs) and performance time (the average duration or resource usage per occurrence). This will help visualize how the process unfolds over time from creating a fine to dealing with appeals, payments, and collections. Here's an overview of the temporal profile:

### Step-by-Step Overview

#### 1. **Create Fine**
   - Frequency: 963 occurrences
   - Performance Time: Various durations depending on context but generally not explicitly stated for this step.

#### 2. **Send Fine**
   - Frequency: 963 occurrences (coincides with Create Fine as each fine creation should result in its being sent)

#### 3. **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture**
   - Frequency: This appears more granularly in several steps, suggesting it occurs multiple times during the process's progression.

#### 4. **Insert Fine Notification**
   - Frequency: Linked to Step 1 after a fine is created and before an appeal or subsequent actions

#### 5. **Add Penalty**
   - Frequency: Occurs after appeals are processed (appears in some scenarios with varying frequencies)

#### 6. **Send Appeal to Prefecture**
   - Frequency: Occurs following the creation of a fine, as entities may choose to contest the fine
   - Performance Time: Varies based on the number of steps and resources required for appeal processing

#### 7. **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture**
   - Frequency: Occurs after sending an appeal, usually only once per appeal process.

#### 8. **Notify Result Appeal to Offender**
   - Frequency: Following receipt and review of appeals, notifying the fine recipient about the outcome
   - Performance Time: This step is typically quick but depends on the system's communication time

#### 9. **Payment**
   - Frequency: Occurs after notification or resolution of disputes, with payments being made in various stages (123 occurrences)
   - Performance Time: Can vary from immediate to days/weeks depending on payment methods and banking processes.

#### 10. **Send for Credit Collection**
   - Frequency: Occurs as a last resort when other payment options fail
   - Performance Time: Varies but generally takes longer than regular payments

### Overall Temporal Profile

The temporal profile would essentially depict a timeline where:
- Creating a fine initiates the process.
- Sending the fine and inserting dates are concurrent steps.
- Appeals might be sent after receiving the notice, leading to reviews which determine if penalties need adding or disputes must be resolved.
- Notifications of the appeal outcome follow closely after the appeal is reviewed.
- Payment happens once the issue with the fine is resolved or if accepted by the recipient.
- Credit collection as a final step is used when payments are not made in response to appeals.

**Graphical Representation:**
The profile could be visualized using a flowchart with nodes for each stage and directed edges indicating sequence. Each node would have a label showing the frequency (how many times it occurs) and possibly an estimate or range of time spent on average per occurrence, depending on detailed data. This diagram helps in understanding the process's duration from creation to closure.

### Conclusion
To accurately generate a temporal profile, one would need more specific details for each step's time taken, including:
- **Creation Time:** Time taken to initially create the fine.
- **Notification Times:** When appeals are initiated and results communicated.
- **Review Times:** How long it takes to process appeals and decide on penalties or outcomes.
- **Payment Processing Times:** Duration from notification of resolution until payment is received.

This temporal profile would offer insights into bottlenecks, efficiency areas, and potential enhancements in the legal fines handling system.
