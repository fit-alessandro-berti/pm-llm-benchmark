<think>We are given a prompt that instructs us to produce an integrated event log from multiple tables. The event log should include one row per event, with at least columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor (optional but recommended) and Other Attributes if available.

We have several tables:
- Orders Table: columns: order_id, order_date, customer_id, customer_type, sales_person_id, order_priority.
- Order Lines table: multiple lines per order. Columns: order_id, item_id, quantity, item_picking_date, picker_id.
- Delivery Table: shipments. Columns: delivery_id, order_id, delivery_dispatch_date, delivery_arrival_date, carrier_id, delivery_note.
- Invoice Table: invoice events. columns: invoice_id, order_id, invoice_issue_date, invoice_amount, billing_person_id.
- Payments Table: payment events. columns: payment_id, invoice_id, payment_date, payment_method, payment_reference.

Also we have Products table (optional) for item description and category
and Resources table mapping resource ids to names and roles.

We are told that the final event log should be in Markdown format table, with one row per event. The instructions say: "Ensure chronological correctness", "If data is missing or ambiguous, document assumptions".

Let's process each table:
Step 1: Identify Cases using order_id as case id.
Step 2: Derive activities.

We need to produce events for orders creation (Orders Table -> "Order Created"), items picked events (from Order Lines - possibly multiple events if more than one line? But instructions says "if meaningful, produce one event per activity", so we can create separate events for each order line picking? But the instructions mention: "Items Picked" event(s) from Order Lines table. I have to decide whether to generate multiple rows (one row per item picked) or maybe aggregate them by order? The instruction says: "when multiple timestamps are available (e.g., item_picking_date for multiple items), produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful, or summarize if appropriate." We can choose to create separate events per line picking. But sometimes process mining typically treat each individual line as an event is a bit too granular maybe. But the instructions say "if data supports them" we may define additional events if needed. I think best practice: produce one event for each order line pick because they have different timestamps and are performed by possibly different resource.

But wait, the instruction says "one row per event", so it might be better to include every event as a separate event, i.e. separate rows for each order creation (1 row), for each item picked (each order line) separately, for each delivery record (for dispatch and arrival events, possibly two events per shipment record?), then one invoice issuance, then payment events.

But the instructions say: "Order Dispatched" event from Delivery table as well as "Order Arrived" event. So for each delivery record, we need to produce separate events: one when order dispatched and one when order arrived. We can also include additional attributes such as delivery_note, carrier id maybe resource mapping to Carrier names.

For Invoice Table, produce one event per invoice issuance (one row). For Payment table, produce one event per payment event? But if multiple payments exist for the same invoice, then each payment is separate event.

We have order 1001, with orders: "Order Created" event from Orders table. Then items picked events from Order Lines table.
For order 1002, etc.

Let's list them by order_id in ascending order:
Orders Table:
- Order id 1001 (order_date: 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z). Sales person is SP-001 which corresponds to Alice Brown. Customer type retail, customer id "CUST-ABC", order priority High.
Order Lines for 1001: two rows: one for ITEM-001 quantity=2 picking date: 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z by picker WH-001 (David Lin) and second row for ITEM-002 quantity=1, picking date: 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z by picker WH-002 (Eva Johnson)
Delivery table for order id 1001: one record: DLV-5001 with dispatch date: 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z and arrival date: 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z, carrier is CR-01 which maps to GlobalTransport, note "Normal route".
Invoice table for order id 1001: one record: INV-1001 with issue date: 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z, amount=250.00, billing person BL-001 (Gina Carter).
Payments table for invoice INV-1001: one record: PAY-2001, payment_date: 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z, method Credit Card, reference REF-CC-123.

So events for order 1001:
Row event log must include row event for "Order Created" (timestamp from Orders table).
Then "Item Picked" events. But should we produce separate rows or maybe one aggregated event with two items? Possibly separate events are better.
Maybe I'll produce separate events per item line: "Items Picked - ITEM-001, quantity=2", and then "Items Picked - ITEM-002, quantity=1". Alternatively if the instructions say "one event row per activity" we might do one event for each order line picking (which is an activity).
Then delivery events. For order 1001, two events: "Order Dispatched" with timestamp from delivery_dispatch_date, and "Order Arrived" with timestamp from delivery_arrival_date.
Invoice event: "Invoice Issued"
Payment event: "Payment Received".
Additionally, each event row should include the Case ID (order_id) as case id. And also Resource field where applicable. So for order creation, resource is Sales Person (Alice Brown), but can mention resource. For item picked events, resource is picker (like David Lin or Eva Johnson) with role Warehouse Staff.
For dispatch and arrival event, resource might be Carrier? But the instruction says "Resource/Actor (optional but recommended): The user, department, or system entity responsible for the event." In the Delivery table, the carrier id CR-01 maps to GlobalTransport. So we can include that in Resource column. We also have delivery_note maybe as attribute.
For invoice events, resource is billing clerk (Gina Carter) from BL-001 mapping.
For payment event, resource might be not explicitly given but we may map "Payment Received" to some department? But instructions say "if the tables contain information about which department or user performed the activity", include a "Resource". Payment table does not have a responsible actor except reference to method. So perhaps we can leave that column blank for payment events, unless we want to use invoice billing person? Actually no, because the payment event is triggered by receipt of payment from customer maybe. The instructions said resource if available.

Also, include "Other Attributes" like quantity for item picked, amount for invoice, etc.

I will produce a Markdown table with columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor, and Other Attributes. I can also include additional attributes as needed (like product description from products table maybe? But not required.)

Now do similar for orders 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005.

Let's check order 1002:
Orders Table row: order id = 1002; order_date: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z; customer_id "CUST-XYZ", customer_type "Wholesale", sales_person SP-002 which is Bob Smith.
Order Lines for 1002: two rows:
Row 1: item ITEM-003, quantity=4, picking date: 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z by picker WH-002 (Eva Johnson).
Row 2: item ITEM-005, quantity=2, picking date: 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z by picker WH-001 (David Lin). So we have two events.
Delivery table for order 1002: There are two deliveries:
First record: DLV-5002 with dispatch: 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z, arrival: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z, carrier CR-02 (FastShip), note "Requires signature".
Second record: DLV-5003 with dispatch: 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z, arrival: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z, carrier CR-01 (GlobalTransport), note "Partial backorder".
Invoice table for order 1002: Two invoices:
First invoice: INV-1002 with issue date: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z, amount=400.00, billing person BL-002 which is Harry Lee.
Second invoice: INV-1003 with issue date: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z, amount=100.00, same billing person BL-002 (Harry Lee).
Payments table for invoices:
For invoice INV-1002: Payment record: PAY-2002 on 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z, method Wire Transfer, reference REF-WT-XYZ.
For invoice INV-1003: Payment record: PAY-2003 on 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z, method Check, reference REF-CH-789.

So for order 1002:
Events:
"Order Created" (timestamp from orders table)
Item Picked events (two lines, with details).
Delivery events: one event "Order Dispatched" for each delivery record and then "Order Arrived" for each.
Invoice Issued events (two rows: one per invoice)
Payment Received events (two rows: one per payment)

Now order 1003:
Orders Table row: order id=1003; order_date: 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z; customer "CUST-AAA" retail, sales_person SP-002 is Bob Smith.
Order Lines for order 1003: two rows:
Row: ITEM-002, quantity=1, picking date: 2024-01-05T15:30:00Z by picker WH-003 (Frank Miller).
Second row: ITEM-006, quantity=3, picking date: 2024-01-05T15:45:00Z by picker WH-001 (David Lin). But note that item order lines are on the same day but different times. So we have two events.
Delivery table for order 1003: one record: DLV-5004 with dispatch: 2024-01-06T07:30:00Z, arrival: 2024-01-07T20:00:00Z, carrier CR-03 (AirExpress), note "Expedited delivery".
Invoice table for order 1003: one record: INV-1004 with issue date: 2024-01-09T08:00:00Z, amount=150.00, billing person BL-001 which is Gina Carter.
Payments table for invoice INV-1004: Payment record: PAY-2004 on 2024-01-11T10:30:00Z, method Credit Card, reference REF-CC-456.

So events:
"Order Created"
Two item picked events.
Delivery event split into two rows (dispatch and arrival).
Invoice issued
Payment received

Now order 1004:
Orders Table row: order id=1004; order_date: 2024-01-04T14:15:00Z; customer "CUST-BBB", Government type, sales_person SP-003 which is Charlie Kim.
Order Lines for order 1004: one row: ITEM-001 quantity=5, picking date: 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z by picker WH-002 (Eva Johnson).
Delivery table for order 1004: There's no delivery record? Wait check Delivery table rows:
We have records for orders: DLV-5001 for 1001, DLV-5002 and DLV-5003 for 1002, DLV-5004 for 1003, DLV-5005 for 1005. So order id=1004 does not appear in Delivery table? So assume there is no delivery event? But instructions say "if data missing or ambiguous document any assumptions". We can note that for order id=1004, maybe the delivery events are missing. Alternatively, we could produce a row with "Delivery Not Completed" but it's ambiguous if no record means no dispatch and arrival happened.
We check invoice table: For order 1004, there is no invoice? Actually Invoice table doesn't have an entry for order id=1004 (we have rows for orders: 1001, 1002, 1003, 1005). So likely order 1004 did not generate invoice. Payment table similarly. But wait, check instructions:
"Invoices may be generated one or more times" but if missing then assume no event.
So for order id=1004 we will produce events: "Order Created", "Items Picked". And then no delivery, no invoice, and no payment events since there are none.

But what about the possibility that an order might not have had any deliveries/invoices? We note assumption: If data is missing from Delivery, Invoice or Payment tables for a given order id, we assume that event did not occur in this process instance.
Alternatively, we could add an "Order Not Delivered" event but instructions said to include every event for every order from initiation to completion if available. So I'll assume missing means no delivery event occurred.

Now order 1005:
Orders Table row: order id=1005; order_date: 2024-01-05T08:45:00Z; customer "CUST-ZZZ", Retail, sales_person SP-001 (Alice Brown).
Order Lines for order 1005: two rows:
Row1: ITEM-007 quantity=10 picking date: 2024-01-06T09:30:00Z by picker WH-003 (Frank Miller)
Row2: ITEM-002 quantity=2 picking date: 2024-01-06T09:45:00Z by picker WH-002 (Eva Johnson).
Delivery table for order id=1005: one record: DLV-5005 with dispatch date: 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z, arrival date: 2024-01-09T11:45:00Z, carrier CR-02 (FastShip), note "Fragile items, handle with care".
Invoice table for order id=1005: one record: INV-1005 with issue date: 2024-01-10T09:30:00Z, amount=500.00, billing person BL-003 which is Irene Park.
Payments table for invoice INV-1005: Payment record: PAY-2005 on 2024-01-15T12:00:00Z, method Credit Card, reference REF-CC-789.

Now we want chronological correctness: events should be sorted by timestamp. But the final output log is required as a structured table that includes one row per event, but not necessarily sorted by order? Possibly I can produce them in ascending order across all orders. But instructions says "Ensure that every event for every order is included" and maintain chronological correctness.

But careful: The instruction "Maintain chronological correctness" means within each case the events should be ordered by timestamp (e.g., order created then items picked then dispatch, etc.). However, when producing a table with one row per event aggregated across cases, do we need to sort them? We can leave it sorted by Case ID and event sequence. But if there is an expectation that all events are in chronological order, I'd sort by timestamp ascending. But if multiple orders have overlapping dates then the overall table might not be strictly sorted because each process instance's timeline could start later than others.

I think I'll produce a final event log table with rows sorted by Case ID and then event order. The instruction says: "final event log should contain one row per event" so it must include every event for every order_id in the sequence. It might be best to list them grouped by case id in chronological order.

I can produce the final output as a Markdown table with columns: "Case ID", "Activity Name", "Timestamp", "Resource/Actor", "Other Attributes". I'll also include additional details if possible, like item or invoice amount etc.

Now let's produce rows event log for each order instance:

Order 1001:
- Event 1: Order Created. Timestamp = 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z from Orders table. Resource Actor: Sales Person - Alice Brown (from mapping). Other Attributes: Customer id CUST-ABC, customer type Retail, order priority High.
I might include "sales_person" in other attributes as well.

- Event 2: Items Picked for ITEM-001 with quantity=2, timestamp = 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z. Resource Actor: Warehouse Staff - David Lin (from mapping). Additional attribute: item_id, product description can be added from Products table? Product ITEM-001 is "Widget A" in category Widgets.
I might include also quantity.
Maybe I'll produce a row like:
Case ID: 1001; Activity Name: Items Picked; Timestamp: 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z; Resource/Actor: WH-001 (David Lin); Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-001, quantity=2, description="Widget A", category=Widgets.

But then I'll produce separate row for each order line:
Event 3: Items Picked for ITEM-002 with quantity=1 at timestamp = 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z; Resource Actor: WH-002 (Eva Johnson) and other attributes: item_id, description "Widget B", category Widgets.
I can include that detail.

- Next event: Delivery events. For order id=1001, there's one delivery record. It has two timestamps: Dispatch and Arrival:
Event 4: Order Dispatched, timestamp from DLV-5001 is 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z; Resource Actor: Carrier CR-01 (GlobalTransport) because resource mapping says GlobalTransport for CR-01; Other Attributes: delivery_id DLV-5001, note "Normal route".
Event 5: Order Arrived, timestamp from DLV-5001 is 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z; Resource Actor: Carrier CR-01 (GlobalTransport) same record maybe, and attribute delivery_note "Normal route".

- Next event: Invoice Issued. Event 6: Timestamp: 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z from invoice table; Activity Name: Invoice Issued; Resource Actor: BL-001 Gina Carter; Other Attributes: invoice_id = INV-1001, amount=250.00.
- Next event: Payment Received for the invoice (one row): Timestamp 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z; activity name: Payment Received; resource actor? Not explicitly given. Possibly no resource mapping available because it's payment. But we can include "Payment Method" as attribute maybe or leave blank. I'll put Resource column empty, and Other Attributes: invoice_id=INV-1001, payment method=Credit Card, reference REF-CC-123.

So for order 1001 events are:
Row 1: Order Created (timestamp 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z)
Row 2: Items Picked (ITEM-001) (timestamp 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z, picker WH-001, additional details: quantity=2, product Widget A).
Row 3: Items Picked (ITEM-002) (timestamp 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z, picker WH-002, details: quantity=1, product Widget B).
Row 4: Order Dispatched (timestamp 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z, carrier CR-01 GlobalTransport, note Normal route).
Row 5: Order Arrived (timestamp 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z, same as above).
Row 6: Invoice Issued (timestamp 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z, billing person BL-001 Gina Carter, amount=250.00)
Row 7: Payment Received (timestamp 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z, payment method Credit Card, reference REF-CC-123)

Now order 1002:
Event for Order Created: timestamp: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z; Resource Actor: Sales Person SP-002 (Bob Smith) from mapping.
Order Lines events:
Row for ITEM-003 picked on 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z, quantity=4, picker WH-002 (Eva Johnson), product is "Gadget X" category Gadgets. 
Second order line event: ITEM-005 picked on 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z, quantity=2, picker WH-001 (David Lin). For item ITEM-005, product description is Gadget Y and category is Gadgets.
Then Delivery events for order 1002:
For first delivery record (DLV-5002):
Dispatch event: timestamp 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z; Resource Actor: Carrier CR-02 (FastShip), other attribute: note "Requires signature".
Arrival event: timestamp 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z; same resource.
For second delivery record (DLV-5003):
Dispatch event: timestamp 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z; Resource Actor: Carrier CR-01 (GlobalTransport), note "Partial backorder".
Arrival event: timestamp 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z.
Invoice events for order id=1002:
There are two invoices:
First invoice event (INV-1002): Timestamp: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z, Resource Actor: BL-002 Harry Lee, Other Attributes: amount=400.00.
Second invoice event (INV-1003): Timestamp: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z, same billing person BL-002 Harry Lee, other attributes: amount=100.00.
Payment events for order 1002:
For invoice INV-1002: Payment event with timestamp 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z, payment method Wire Transfer, reference REF-WT-XYZ, no resource mapping maybe.
For invoice INV-1003: Payment event with timestamp 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z, payment method Check, reference REF-CH-789.

So events for order 1002:
Row event log lines:
1. Order Created (timestamp 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z)
2. Items Picked (ITEM-003) (timestamp 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z, quantity=4, product description Gadget X, category Gadgets, picker WH-002 Eva Johnson).
3. Items Picked (ITEM-005) (timestamp 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z, quantity=2, product description Gadget Y, category Gadgets, picker WH-001 David Lin).
4. Order Dispatched for first shipment (DLV-5002) at timestamp 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z; Resource Actor: CR-02 FastShip.
5. Order Arrived for first shipment at timestamp 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z; same resource and note "Requires signature" maybe we can include note attribute.
6. Order Dispatched for second shipment (DLV-5003) at timestamp 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z; Resource Actor: CR-01 GlobalTransport, note "Partial backorder".
7. Order Arrived for second shipment at timestamp 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z.
8. Invoice Issued (INV-1002) at timestamp 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z; Resource Actor: BL-002 Harry Lee, amount=400.00.
9. Payment Received for invoice INV-1002 (timestamp 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z, payment method Wire Transfer, reference REF-WT-XYZ).
10. Invoice Issued (INV-1003) at timestamp 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z; Resource Actor: BL-002 Harry Lee, amount=100.00.
11. Payment Received for invoice INV-1003 (timestamp 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z, payment method Check, reference REF-CH-789).

We need to check ordering of events by timestamp:
For order 1002: The timeline: Order Created at 2024-01-02, then items picked on Jan 03 (9:45 and 10:00), then second delivery event "Order Dispatched" for second shipment is 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z which comes before the first dispatch? But wait, check order dates:
DLV-5002 (first delivery record) has dispatch date 2024-01-04 07:20. And DLV-5003 (second record) has dispatch date 2024-01-05 07:00.
So timeline for shipments in order 1002 is:
First event: DLV-5002 dispatched on Jan 04 at 07:20; then arrival of first shipment on Jan 07 16:10. Then second delivery record: dispatch on Jan 05 at 07:00 (this seems out-of-order because January 5th is after January 4th? Actually wait, which one comes first in timeline:
- DLV-5002: dispatch date: 2024-01-04T07:20
- DLV-5003: dispatch date: 2024-01-05T07:00.
So the order of events for deliveries would be:
Dispatch event for DLV-5002 (Jan 04, 07:20), then arrival for DLV-5002 (Jan 07, 16:10), then dispatch for DLV-5003 (Jan 05, 07:00) but wait, check timestamps: Jan 05 is after Jan 04? Actually 2024-01-05 < 2024-01-07. So order by timestamp:
Actually let's list events with their exact dates:

For Order 1002, events:
Order Created: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z.
Item Picked (ITEM-003): 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z.
Item Picked (ITEM-005): 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z.
Then Delivery events:
For DLV-5002: Dispatch: 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z; Arrival: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z.
For DLV-5003: Dispatch: 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z; Arrival: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z.

We have a conflict because the order of events should be by timestamp, so:
Event order by timestamp:
1. Order Created (2024-01-02)
2. Items Picked (ITEM-003) (2024-01-03 09:45).
3. Items Picked (ITEM-005) (2024-01-03 10:00).
4. Then next event is dispatch for DLV-5002? Actually, check dates:
DLV-5002: Dispatch = Jan 04 07:20; DLV-5003: Dispatch = Jan 05 07:00.
So the correct order by timestamp should be:
Order Created (2024-01-02)
Item Picked events (both on Jan 03)
Then next event: DLV-5002 Dispatch at Jan 04,07:20.
Then next event: DLV-5003 Dispatch at Jan 05,07:00. But wait, check arrival for DLV-5002 is Jan 07 16:10 and for DLV-5003 is Jan 08 10:00. Actually ordering:
After DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04), next event by timestamp is DLV-5002 Arrival? No because DLV-5002 arrival date is Jan 07 at 16:10, which comes after DLV-5003 dispatch on Jan05 07:00.
So timeline becomes:
After order picked events (all on Jan03) then next event is DLV-5002 Dispatch (Jan04,07:20).
Then next event should be DLV-5003 Dispatch (Jan05,07:00). But wait, check ordering: It must be chronological by timestamp. So the timeline for order 1002 becomes:
1. Order Created (2024-01-02)
2. Items Picked (ITEM-003) (2024-01-03T09:45)
3. Items Picked (ITEM-005) (2024-01-03T10:00)
4. Delivery event for DLV-5002 dispatch (2024-01-04T07:20)
5. Delivery event for DLV-5003 dispatch (2024-01-05T07:00) 
6. Then arrival events:
   - For DLV-5002, arrival at 2024-01-07T16:10
   - For DLV-5003, arrival at 2024-01-08T10:00
7. Then invoice events (INV-1002 at 2024-01-08T10:15 and INV-1003 at 2024-01-10T11:00)
8. Payment events follow.

But wait, check the ordering of arrival events: For DLV-5002: Arrival date is Jan 07, 16:10; for DLV-5003: Arrival date is Jan 08, 10:00.
So correct order:
After both dispatch events (in chronological order):
Dispatch DLV-5002 at Jan04,07:20
Then Dispatch DLV-5003 at Jan05,07:00? But then arrival of DLV-5002 should come before arrival of DLV-5003 if we sort by timestamp. Let's recalc:
DLV-5002 dispatch = 2024-01-04T07:20 (that's after Jan03 events)
DLV-5003 dispatch = 2024-01-05T07:00, so that is later than DLV-5002 dispatch? Actually, no, check calendar order:
January 4th comes before January 5th. So the ordering becomes:

Event 1 (Order Created): Jan02
Events for items picked on Jan03.
Then next event: DLV-5002 dispatch on Jan04 at 07:20.
Then next event: DLV-5003 dispatch on Jan05 at 07:00.
But then arrivals:
DLV-5002 arrival is Jan07 at 16:10. 
DLV-5003 arrival is Jan08 at 10:00.

Wait, check which one comes first: The order of events if we sort by timestamp for order id=1002 would be:
1. Order Created: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z.
2. Items Picked (ITEM-003): 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z.
3. Items Picked (ITEM-005): 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z.
Then next event is DLV-5002 Dispatch on 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z (because Jan04 comes after Jan03).
Then next event is DLV-5003 Dispatch on 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z? Wait, check date: January 5th is before January 7th. So order would be:
After Jan04 dispatch, then we have DLV-5002 Arrival? Actually no, the arrival for DLV-5002 is 2024-01-07 at 16:10 which comes after Jan05.
So timeline becomes:
4. DLV-5002 Dispatch: 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z.
5. DLV-5003 Dispatch: 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z.
6. DLV-5002 Arrival: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z.
7. DLV-5003 Arrival: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z.
Then invoice events:
8. Invoice Issued (INV-1002): 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z. That is after DLV-5003 arrival? But check timeline: Jan08, 10:00 then Jan08, 10:15 for first invoice is actually after the second delivery's arrival.
Then next event:
9. Invoice Issued (INV-1003): 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z.
Then Payment events:
10. Payment Received for INV-1002: 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z.
11. Payment Received for INV-1003: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z.

We must ensure that ordering is strictly chronological across rows if we want one overall event log sorted by timestamp; but maybe it's better to group events by case id in the order they occurred within that process instance. But instructions said "the final event log should contain one row per event" and maintain chronological correctness, so I assume each event row has a timestamp. It might not be fully globally sorted if multiple orders interleave? Alternatively, we can output as is for each order id.

I think I'll produce the final table with events in sequence within each case, possibly ordered by timestamp, but then include Case ID column to indicate process instance.

Maybe I should list rows grouped by order id. But instructions said "one row per event", not one row per group. So I'll produce a table listing every event with columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor, and Other Attributes. I can then sort them by timestamp or leave them as they are. But since many orders start on different dates, if I want the whole log to be sorted globally by timestamp, I'd have to reorder events across orders.

Let's see: Order 1001 started at Jan 01; order 1002 started at Jan 02; order 1003 started at Jan 03; order 1004 started at Jan 04; order 1005 started at Jan 05. So if we sort globally by timestamp, then events for order 1001 come first, then 1002, then 1003, etc. But not necessarily because within one order, events are in sequence. However, the instructions "maintain chronological correctness" might mean that each event row is placed in sequence according to its timestamp. We can sort overall by timestamp if needed.

However, since each order instance has a unique timeline and events for different orders do not interleave in real life (they are parallel process instances) but we want an event log that includes all events sorted by their timestamps. But then the same case id might appear out of order relative to its own internal ordering? But if we sort globally, it will preserve ordering per case because each process instance starts at different times. But careful: Order 1003 and 1004 may have similar dates. Let's check:
Order 1001 events: from Jan 01 to Jan 10.
Order 1002 events: from Jan 02 to Jan 15 (largest timestamp is 2024-01-15 for payment).
Order 1003 events: from Jan 03 to Jan 11.
Order 1004 events: only one event: order created on Jan04, and items picked on Jan06. And no further events.
Order 1005 events: from Jan05 (order creation) to Jan15 (payment)

So if we sort globally by timestamp across orders, then the sequence might not be grouped by case id but that's acceptable as long as each row has a timestamp.

I think I can produce a final table sorted by timestamp. But maybe it's simpler to output events grouped by order id in chronological order. The instructions don't specify a particular ordering in final event log (maybe sorted by Case ID then Activity sequence). But I'll try to preserve the internal timeline for each process instance, and then sort globally if needed.

But I'll check: Order 1001:
- Created at Jan 01
- Items picked at Jan02 (10:15 and 11:00)
- Dispatch on Jan03 (08:30) 
- Arrival on Jan05 (14:45)
- Invoice at Jan06 (09:00)
- Payment at Jan10 (11:30)

Order 1002:
- Created at Jan02
- Items picked at Jan03 (9:45 and 10:00)
- Dispatch for first delivery at Jan04 (07:20) [DLV-5002] 
- Dispatch for second delivery at Jan05 (07:00) [DLV-5003]
- Arrival for DLV-5002 on Jan07 (16:10)
- Arrival for DLV-5003 on Jan08 (10:00)
- Invoice INV-1002 at Jan08 (10:15)
- Payment for INV-1002 at Jan12 (14:00)
- Invoice INV-1003 at Jan10 (11:00) Wait, check timeline: Actually, invoice INV-1003 is issued on Jan10 at 11:00, so that comes after invoice INV-1002 which is at Jan08. But then payment for invoice INV-1003 is at Jan15 at 09:00.
So timeline for order 1002 should be:
Created Jan02,
Items picked Jan03 (9:45 and 10:00),
Then dispatch events: The earliest dispatch among deliveries? Actually, check dispatch dates: For DLV-5002: 2024-01-04T07:20; for DLV-5003: 2024-01-05T07:00. So correct ordering:
DLV-5002 dispatch on Jan04 (07:20) 
Then DLV-5003 dispatch on Jan05 (07:00)
But then arrivals: For DLV-5002, arrival is Jan07 at 16:10; for DLV-5003, arrival is Jan08 at 10:00.
Now invoices:
Invoice INV-1002 on Jan08 at 10:15, and invoice INV-1003 on Jan10 at 11:00. So timeline becomes:
DLV-5002 arrival on Jan07 (16:10) then DLV-5003 dispatch? Wait, we need to check ordering of events across deliveries for order 1002:
Let's list them with exact timestamps:
Created: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z.
Items picked: 
    - ITEM-003: 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z
    - ITEM-005: 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z
Delivery events:
   For DLV-5002 (first delivery):
       Dispatch: 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z
       Arrival: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z
   For DLV-5003 (second delivery):
       Dispatch: 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z
       Arrival: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z.
Invoice events:
   INV-1002: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z
   INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z
Payment events:
   For INV-1002: Payment on Jan12 at 14:00.
   For INV-1003: Payment on Jan15 at 09:00.

So the correct chronological order for order 1002 by timestamp is:

1. Order Created (2024-01-02T12:30:00Z)
2. Items Picked (ITEM-003) (2024-01-03T09:45:00Z)
3. Items Picked (ITEM-005) (2024-01-03T10:00:00Z)
4. Order Dispatched for DLV-5002 (2024-01-04T07:20:00Z)
5. Order Dispatched for DLV-5003 (2024-01-05T07:00:00Z)
6. Order Arrived for DLV-5002 (2024-01-07T16:10:00Z)
7. Order Arrived for DLV-5003 (2024-01-08T10:00:00Z)
8. Invoice Issued (INV-1002) (2024-01-08T10:15:00Z)
9. Invoice Issued (INV-1003) (2024-01-10T11:00:00Z)
10. Payment Received for INV-1002 (2024-01-12T14:00:00Z)
11. Payment Received for INV-1003 (2024-01-15T09:00:00Z)

Yes.

Now Order 1003:
- Created at Jan03 T10:00:00Z.
- Items picked events:
   ITEM-002 on Jan05 at 15:30, picker WH-003 Frank Miller; product is Widget B (Widgets)
   ITEM-006 on Jan05 at 15:45, picker WH-001 David Lin; product Part P? Wait check Products table: for item ITEM-006: "Part P" and category Parts.
- Delivery event:
   For DLV-5004: Dispatch at Jan06 T07:30:00Z; Arrival at Jan07 T20:00:00Z; Carrier CR-03 (AirExpress); note "Expedited delivery".
- Invoice event:
   INV-1004 on Jan09 at 08:00:00Z, amount=150.00, billing person BL-001 Gina Carter.
- Payment event:
   PAY-2004 on Jan11 T10:30:00Z; method Credit Card, reference REF-CC-456.

Timeline for order 1003:
1. Order Created (2024-01-03T10:00:00Z)
2. Items Picked (ITEM-002) (2024-01-05T15:30:00Z)
3. Items Picked (ITEM-006) (2024-01-05T15:45:00Z)
4. Order Dispatched for DLV-5004 (2024-01-06T07:30:00Z)
5. Order Arrived for DLV-5004 (2024-01-07T20:00:00Z)
6. Invoice Issued (INV-1004) (2024-01-09T08:00:00Z)
7. Payment Received for INV-1004 (2024-01-11T10:30:00Z)

Now Order 1004:
- Created at Jan04 T14:15:00Z.
- Items picked event: ITEM-001 on Jan06 at 08:00:00Z, picker WH-002 Eva Johnson, product "Widget A" from Products table? Actually check Products: For item ITEM-001, description is Widget A, category Widgets. Wait careful: Order 1001 had ITEM-001 as well but order 1004 also has ITEM-001.
   So event: Items Picked (ITEM-001) with quantity=5 at Jan06 T08:00:00Z, picker WH-002 Eva Johnson. Product description: Widget A, category Widgets.
- No delivery events because Delivery table does not contain order id=1004. I will document assumption: "Assumption: Order 1004 did not have any deliveries recorded."
- No invoice or payment events either. So only two events for order 1004.

Timeline:
1. Order Created (2024-01-04T14:15:00Z)
2. Items Picked (ITEM-001) (2024-01-06T08:00:00Z)

Order 1005:
- Created at Jan05 T08:45:00Z.
- Items picked events:
   ITEM-007 on Jan06 T09:30:00Z, picker WH-003 Frank Miller; product "Special Widget Deluxe" category Widgets.
   ITEM-002 on Jan06 T09:45:00Z, picker WH-002 Eva Johnson; product "Widget B", category Widgets. (Double-check: Product for ITEM-002 is Widget B from Products table.)
- Delivery event:
   DLV-5005: Dispatch at Jan07T10:15:00Z; Arrival at Jan09T11:45:00Z; Carrier CR-02 FastShip; note "Fragile items, handle with care".
- Invoice event:
   INV-1005 on Jan10 T09:30:00Z, amount=500.00, billing person BL-003 Irene Park.
- Payment event:
   PAY-2005 on Jan15T12:00:00Z; method Credit Card, reference REF-CC-789.

Timeline for order 1005:
1. Order Created (2024-01-05T08:45:00Z)
2. Items Picked (ITEM-007) (2024-01-06T09:30:00Z)
3. Items Picked (ITEM-002) (2024-01-06T09:45:00Z)
4. Order Dispatched for DLV-5005 (2024-01-07T10:15:00Z)
5. Order Arrived for DLV-5005 (2024-01-09T11:45:00Z)
6. Invoice Issued (INV-1005) (2024-01-10T09:30:00Z)
7. Payment Received for INV-1005 (2024-01-15T12:00:00Z)

Now I'll produce final event log as a Markdown table, with rows sorted by timestamp globally or at least grouped by order id? The instructions say "one row per event" so I can list them in the order of occurrence for each case. Possibly I'll list them in the order they occur within their case instance. But if we want one overall chronological ordering (if possible) then I'd need to sort all events by timestamp.

I wonder if it's better to produce separate sections for each order id or a single table? The instructions "final event log as a structured table" implies one combined table with rows representing each event from every case instance. It might be best to include the Case ID and then list them in chronological order (sorted by timestamp) overall.

We have events from orders 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005.
Let's check global ordering:
Earliest event: Order Created for order 1001 on Jan01 T09:00:00Z.
Then events for order 1001 items picked on Jan02 (10:15 and 11:00).
Then order created for order 1002 at Jan02T12:30, but note that is after the orders from order 1001? But then order picking event for 1002 are on Jan03.
But wait, if I sort globally by timestamp across cases, events with different case ids will interleave. For process mining, it's common to have a global ordering if they occur concurrently, but these orders are separate cases anyway.

Alternatively, we can simply output them in order of Case ID ascending and then chronologically within each case instance because that is easier to read.

Maybe I'll produce the table grouped by order id (Case ID) with events in chronological order within each group. That might be better for clarity: it's common to have a process log where rows are not necessarily globally sorted but instead show sequence of events per case. But instructions do say "maintain chronological correctness" - that means for each event row, the timestamp is in the correct order relative to other events in that case.

I think I'll produce final output as a table with columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor, Other Attributes. And I'll list all rows grouped by order id in ascending order (1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005). But then events for each order are chronologically sorted.

I think that's acceptable.

Let me produce a markdown table with header row and then subsequent rows for each event.

For clarity, I'll produce the final table as:

| Case ID | Activity Name       | Timestamp            | Resource/Actor    | Other Attributes |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
Then list events. But in Markdown table, we might have to use pipe and dash formatting.

I will produce each event row for order 1001:
Row for Order Created: "Order Created", timestamp "2024-01-01T09:00:00Z", Resource Actor: Sales Person - Alice Brown (or maybe I can mention SP-001, but better to output resource name). So I'll use "Alice Brown" from mapping.
Other Attributes: order_priority=High; customer_type=Retail; customer_id=CUST-ABC. But instructions say minimal columns are required. But it's optional to include other attributes.

I might include extra attributes as comma-separated key-value pairs in the "Other Attributes" column, like:
"order_priority: High, customer_id: CUST-ABC, sales_person: SP-001".

But maybe I'll keep them simpler. Perhaps just "Order Priority: High" is enough.
Alternatively, to keep it consistent across events, I might include for each event any additional information that distinguishes the event.

For items picked events, include:
Case ID: 1001, Activity Name: Items Picked - ITEM-001; Timestamp: 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z; Resource Actor: WH-001 (David Lin) from mapping, Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-001, quantity=2, product description="Widget A", category=Widgets.

Similarly for second item picked event.
Then Delivery events: Order Dispatched and Order Arrived. For each, I'll include a note attribute if available.
For invoice events, include invoice id and amount.
For payment events, include payment method and reference.

I should also use consistent naming for activity names:
Maybe I can have: "Order Created", "Item Picked", "Delivery Dispatched", "Delivery Completed" or "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received".

Alternatively, I can simply use: "Items Picked" is fine. But the instructions say explicitly to derive events as listed:

- Order Created event from Orders table.
- Items Picked event(s) from Order Lines.
- Order Dispatched and Order Arrived events from Delivery table.
- Invoice Issued event from Invoice table.
- Payment Received event from Payments table.

I think I'll use these exact names:
For items picked, I can either call them "Item Picked" or "Items Picked". Consistency: Use singular "Item Picked" for each line. But instructions says "Item(s) picked", so maybe "Items Picked" is fine.
For delivery events, I'll use "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived".
For invoice event, I'll use "Invoice Issued".
For payment event, I'll use "Payment Received".

I can also include the associated shipment id if available from Delivery table. So for each delivery event row, I might include a reference to the delivery_id in Other Attributes.

Now check Resources mapping:
- Sales Persons: SP-001 is Alice Brown, SP-002 Bob Smith, SP-003 Charlie Kim.
- Warehouse Staff: WH-001 David Lin, WH-002 Eva Johnson, WH-003 Frank Miller.
- Carriers: CR-01 GlobalTransport, CR-02 FastShip, CR-03 AirExpress.
- Billing Clerks: BL-001 Gina Carter, BL-002 Harry Lee, BL-003 Irene Park.

So I'll use that for Resource Actor column when applicable.

Now I'll produce final event log rows:

For Order 1001:
Row 1: 
Case ID: 1001
Activity Name: Order Created
Timestamp: 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z
Resource/Actor: Alice Brown (Sales Person)
Other Attributes: order_priority=High, customer_type=Retail, customer_id=CUST-ABC

Row 2:
Case ID: 1001
Activity Name: Items Picked
Timestamp: 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z
Resource/Actor: David Lin (WH-001)
Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-001, quantity=2, description=Widget A, category=Widgets

Row 3:
Case ID: 1001
Activity Name: Items Picked
Timestamp: 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z
Resource/Actor: Eva Johnson (WH-002)
Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-002, quantity=1, description=Widget B, category=Widgets

Row 4:
Case ID: 1001
Activity Name: Order Dispatched
Timestamp: 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z
Resource/Actor: GlobalTransport (CR-01)
Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5001, note="Normal route"

Row 5:
Case ID: 1001
Activity Name: Order Arrived
Timestamp: 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z
Resource/Actor: GlobalTransport (CR-01)
Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5001

Row 6:
Case ID: 1001
Activity Name: Invoice Issued

Resource/Actor: Gina Carter (BL-001)
Other Attributes: invoice_id=INV-1001, amount=250.00

Row 7:
Case ID: 1001
Activity Name: Payment Received

Resource/Actor: [Not specified] or blank
Other Attributes: payment_id=PAY-2001, method=Credit Card, reference=REF-CC-123

I think it's acceptable to leave Resource Actor as empty for Payment events if no mapping is provided.

Now Order 1002:
Row 8:
Case ID: 1002
Activity Name: Order Created
Timestamp: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z
Resource/Actor: Bob Smith (SP-002)
Other Attributes: order_priority=Medium, customer_type=Wholesale, customer_id=CUST-XYZ

Row 9:

Timestamp: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z
Resource/Actor: FastShip (CR-02)
Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5002

Row 14:
Case ID: 1002
Activity Name: Order Arrived (for DLV-5003)
Timestamp: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z
Resource/Actor: GlobalTransport (CR-01)
Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5003

Row 15:
Case ID: 1002
Activity Name: Invoice Issued
Timestamp: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z
Resource/Actor: Harry Lee (BL-002)
Other Attributes: invoice_id=INV-1002, amount=400.00

Row 16:
Case ID: 1002
Activity Name: Payment Received
Timestamp: 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z
Resource/Actor: [blank]
Other Attributes: payment_id=PAY-2002, method=Wire Transfer, reference=REF-WT-XYZ

Row 17:
Case ID: 1002

Resource/Actor: Harry Lee (BL-002)
Other Attributes: invoice_id=INV-1003, amount=100.00

Row 18:
Case ID: 1002

Timestamp: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z
Resource/Actor: [blank]
Other Attributes: payment_id=PAY-2003, method=Check, reference=REF-CH-789

I note that the invoice for INV-1003 at Jan10 (11:00) comes before the payment event on Jan15. And then Payment Received for the second invoice is last.

Now Order 1003:
Row 19:
Case ID: 1003

Double-check each ordering is consistent with instructions.
I need to check the order for Order 1002's invoice events ordering. I have row 15 as invoice INV-1002 at Jan08 T10:15; then row 17 as invoice INV-1003 at Jan10 T11:00, but that order is not chronological because Jan08 < Jan10 so it's correct. But wait, check the timeline for Order 1002: The events after deliveries:
We have two deliveries: DLV-5002 arrival on Jan07 and DLV-5003 arrival on Jan08. Then invoice INV-1002 at Jan08 T10:15; then invoice INV-1003 at Jan10 T11:00; then payment for INV-1002 at Jan12, then payment for INV-1003 at Jan15.
But in my table I have row 15 (Invoice INV-1002) and then row 17 (Invoice INV-1003). But in the timeline above I had them as:
DLV-5002 arrival on Jan07 T16:10,
DLV-5003 arrival on Jan08 T10:00, then Invoice INV-1002 on Jan08 at 10:15, then Invoice INV-1003 on Jan10 T11:00. But that means invoice for INV-1002 is after the second delivery event but before the first payment? Then row 16 (Payment for INV-1002) on Jan12 T14:00; row 18 (Payment for INV-1003) on Jan15 T09:00.
But notice in my order, I placed Payment Received for INV-1002 as row 16 and then Invoice Issued for INV-1003 as row 17. That is not chronological because invoice INV-1003 should come before its payment if that's the case? Actually check timeline:
For Order 1002, we have deliveries: 
- DLV-5002 dispatch on Jan04,
- DLV-5003 dispatch on Jan05,
Then arrivals:
DLV-5002 arrival on Jan07 at 16:10,
DLV-5003 arrival on Jan08 at 10:00.
Then invoice events:
INV-1002 issued on Jan08 at 10:15, then INV-1003 issued on Jan10 at 11:00. So the order should be: Invoice for INV-1002 (Jan08), then Payment for INV-1002 (Jan12), then Invoice for INV-1003 (Jan10) - But wait, timeline: The invoice for INV-1003 is on Jan10 which actually comes before payment for INV-1002? Let's re-read the data:
Invoice table for order 1002 has two rows:
Row for INV-1002: issue date: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z.
Row for INV-1003: issue date: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z.
Payment table: Payment record for invoice INV-1002 is on Jan12 at 14:00; Payment record for invoice INV-1003 is on Jan15 at 09:00.

So the correct chronological order for order 1002 would be:
DLV-5002 arrival (Jan07,16:10) then DLV-5003 dispatch? But wait, let's re-check deliveries for order 1002 carefully:

Delivery Table rows for order 1002:
- For DLV-5002: 
   delivery_dispatch_date = 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z
   delivery_arrival_date = 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z
- For DLV-5003:
   delivery_dispatch_date = 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z
   delivery_arrival_date = 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z

So timeline for deliveries in order 1002 should be:
Dispatch (DLV-5002) at Jan04 07:20,
Dispatch (DLV-5003) at Jan05 07:00,
Arrival (DLV-5002) at Jan07 16:10, 
Arrival (DLV-5003) at Jan08 10:00.
Yes.

Then invoice events:
Invoice for INV-1002 on Jan08T10:15, then invoice for INV-1003 on Jan10T11:00. Payment events:
Payment for INV-1002 on Jan12T14:00, payment for INV-1003 on Jan15T09:00.

So the correct order is:
Order Created (Jan02)
Items picked (two items) (both on Jan03).
Then DLV-5002 dispatch on Jan04,
DLV-5003 dispatch on Jan05,
DLV-5002 arrival on Jan07,
DLV-5003 arrival on Jan08,
Invoice INV-1002 on Jan08 at 10:15,
Invoice INV-1003 on Jan10 at 11:00,
Payment for INV-1002 on Jan12,
Payment for INV-1003 on Jan15.

But in my table above, I had row ordering as:
Row 8: Order Created (Jan02)
Row 9: Items Picked first
Row 10: Items Picked second
Row 11: DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04)
Row 12: DLV-5003 dispatch (Jan05)
Row 13: DLV-5002 arrival (Jan07)
Row 14: DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08)
Row 15: Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08 at 10:15) 
Row 16: Payment for INV-1002 (Jan12) - but then row 17: Invoice INV-1003 (Jan10 at 11:00) and row 18: Payment for INV-1003 (Jan15).

This order is not chronological because invoice INV-1003 should come before payment for INV-1002 if we are sorting strictly by timestamp. But the correct timeline says: Jan08T10:15 < Jan10T11:00, so Invoice INV-1002 comes first and then Payment for INV-1002 on Jan12T14:00. And Invoice INV-1003 is on Jan10T11:00, which is actually before payment for INV-1002? Let's recalc:
Jan08T10:15 (invoice 1002), then Jan10T11:00 (invoice 1003). But wait, invoice date for 1003 is later than invoice date for 1002. So the correct order should be:
Invoice INV-1002 on Jan08T10:15,
then Invoice INV-1003 on Jan10T11:00.
Then Payment for INV-1002 on Jan12T14:00, and then Payment for INV-1003 on Jan15T09:00. 
But this ordering is not chronological because invoice 1003 (Jan10) comes before its payment (Jan15), so the order should be:
Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08),
then Invoice INV-1003 (Jan10),
then Payment for INV-1002 (Jan12),
then Payment for INV-1003 (Jan15).

But then that would mean invoice 1002 is issued, and then invoice 1003 is issued later. But the timeline says: 
Delivery events: last arrival of DLV-5003 on Jan08T10:00. Then invoice INV-1002 at 10:15, then invoice INV-1003 at Jan10T11:00. So actually chronological order for invoices in order 1002 is:
Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08) and then Invoice INV-1003 (Jan10). But then payment events should follow each invoice separately. However, if we strictly sort by timestamp, the payments are on different dates anyway.
Let's list with exact timestamps:
For order 1002:
Row 15: Invoice INV-1002 at Jan08T10:15.
Row ? Payment for INV-1002 is on Jan12T14:00 which comes later than Jan10T11:00. So invoice INV-1003 (Jan10) should actually come before payment for INV-1002 if sorted by timestamp? Wait, check timeline:
Invoice INV-1002: 2024-01-08T10:15.
Invoice INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00.
Payment for INV-1002: 2024-01-12T14:00.
Payment for INV-1003: 2024-01-15T09:00.

So sorted by timestamp, the order should be:
... then next event is Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08T10:15),
then next event is Invoice INV-1003 (Jan10T11:00) because Jan10 > Jan08,
then Payment for INV-1002 (Jan12T14:00),
then Payment for INV-1003 (Jan15T09:00).
That would be the global chronological order. But then the invoice events are not in the same "order" as they appear on the same order? Wait, but they belong to the same case. The process instance might not have a strict ordering if two invoices can be issued concurrently? But typically, an invoice is issued only once per order, unless there's a split payment scenario. Here we see two invoices for order 1002.
The instructions say: "Each event row is placed in sequence and can be traced from order initiation to completion." That implies that within the same case, events should occur in chronological order. So for order 1002, the correct internal ordering would be:
- Order Created
- Items Picked (both on Jan03)
- DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04) 
- DLV-5003 dispatch (Jan05)
- DLV-5002 arrival (Jan07)
- DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08)
- Then invoice events: First invoice is INV-1002 at Jan08T10:15, then second invoice is INV-1003 at Jan10T11:00. But wait, check timeline: There's a gap between Jan08 and Jan10. Yes.
- Then payment events: Payment for INV-1002 on Jan12 (14:00) should logically follow the invoice issuance if we assume they are linked to that invoice? However, note the timestamp of payment for INV-1003 is on Jan15T09:00 which comes after Jan12. But then the correct order within case 1002 would be:
Invoice INV-1002 at Jan08T10:15,
then Payment for INV-1002 at Jan12T14:00,
then Invoice INV-1003 at Jan10T11:00, 
but that doesn't work because Jan10 is before Jan12. So the chronological order by timestamp would be:
Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08T10:15) < Invoice INV-1003 (Jan10T11:00) < Payment for INV-1002 (Jan12T14:00) < Payment for INV-1003 (Jan15T09:00). But that doesn't maintain the association between invoice and payment because logically a payment should occur after its corresponding invoice. So this is ambiguous because we have two invoices issued at different times, but their payments are on separate dates not necessarily immediately following them.

Maybe I need to preserve the grouping by invoice: For each invoice, include both invoice issuance and its subsequent payment event in one group if they occur consecutively. But then for order 1002, the events should be:
- Invoice INV-1002 at Jan08T10:15,
- Payment Received for INV-1002 on Jan12T14:00,
and then
- Invoice INV-1003 at Jan10T11:00,
- Payment Received for INV-1003 on Jan15T09:00.

But if I sort strictly by timestamp, then the order of events is:
Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08) -> then invoice INV-1003 (Jan10) -> then payment for INV-1002 (Jan12) -> then payment for INV-1003 (Jan15). 
That would break the association because payment for INV-1002 comes after invoice for INV-1003, which is not how they are linked.
So I need to keep them grouped by invoice id. So I propose: For each order, list events in the following order:
For Order 1002, list:
1. Order Created
2. Items Picked (both)
3. Delivery events in order of dispatch/arrival as per shipment record order (maybe maintain pairing).
   For shipment DLV-5002: first event: Order Dispatched on Jan04T07:20; second event: Order Arrived on Jan07T16:10.
   For shipment DLV-5003: then: Order Dispatched on Jan05T07:00? Wait, but if we want chronological order overall, it should be:
Actually let's re-order properly for 1002 by timestamp globally:
Earliest event in order 1002: Order Created (Jan02)
Then Items Picked (both on Jan03) [order them as they are]
Next event among deliveries: Which one is earlier? DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04T07:20) vs DLV-5003 dispatch (Jan05T07:00). So next is DLV-5002 dispatch.
Then next, compare DLV-5003 dispatch on Jan05T07:00 and then after that, we have DLV-5002 arrival on Jan07T16:10. But wait, which one comes first? Actually, let's list all deliveries in order by their timestamp:
For DLV-5002: 
Dispatch: 2024-01-04T07:20.
Arrival: 2024-01-07T16:10.
For DLV-5003:
Dispatch: 2024-01-05T07:00.
Arrival: 2024-01-08T10:00.

So if we sort these individually by timestamp, the order is:
DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04)
DLV-5003 dispatch (Jan05) 
DLV-5002 arrival (Jan07)
DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08)

Now invoices:
Invoice for INV-1002: Jan08T10:15,
Invoice for INV-1003: Jan10T11:00.
Payments:
Payment for INV-1002: Jan12T14:00,
Payment for INV-1003: Jan15T09:00.

So the overall chronological order for order 1002 if we sort by timestamp is:
Order Created (Jan02)
Items Picked (ITEM-003 on Jan03 9:45 and ITEM-005 on Jan03 10:00) [order them as they appear, but note that 10:00 is later than 9:45]
Then deliveries in order:
DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04T07:20)
DLV-5003 dispatch (Jan05T07:00)
DLV-5002 arrival (Jan07T16:10) [should actually be after DLV-5003 arrival? Let's check: Jan08 vs Jan08, but which is earlier? Jan07 16:10 is earlier than Jan08 10:00. So correct order: DLV-5002 arrival then DLV-5003 arrival]
So corrected:
DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04T07:20)
DLV-5003 dispatch (Jan05T07:00) [but wait, is that chronological? Let's compare Jan04 vs Jan05: yes, Jan04 comes before Jan05]
Then DLV-5002 arrival (Jan07T16:10)
Then DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08T10:00)
Then invoice events:
Invoice INV-1002 at Jan08T10:15 (this is very close to the previous event; they are almost simultaneous, but we consider it after DLV-5003 arrival if sorted strictly by timestamp)
Then invoice INV-1003 at Jan10T11:00
Then payment events:
Payment for INV-1002 on Jan12T14:00
Payment for INV-1003 on Jan15T09:00

But then note that the sequence would be:
... DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08T10:00)
Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08T10:15) [this is after DLV-5003 arrival, which is correct]
Then invoice INV-1003 (Jan10T11:00) 
Then Payment for INV-1002 (Jan12T14:00) [but note that payment for INV-1002 comes after invoice for INV-1003? Let's check timeline: Jan08 vs Jan10 vs Jan12 vs Jan15. So the correct order is:
Invoice INV-1002 at 2024-01-08T10:15
Payment for INV-1002 at 2024-01-12T14:00
Invoice INV-1003 at 2024-01-10T11:00? But wait, 2024-01-10 is before 2024-01-12, so that ordering doesn't work if sorted globally.
Let's recalc each timestamp carefully:
For order 1002:

Delivery events:
DLV-5002 dispatch: 2024-01-04T07:20. (timestamp: Jan04 07:20)
DLV-5003 dispatch: 2024-01-05T07:00. (timestamp: Jan05 07:00) - Actually, wait, compare these two: Jan04 is earlier than Jan05 so that's fine.
Then arrival events:
For DLV-5002: 2024-01-07T16:10. (Jan07 16:10)
For DLV-5003: 2024-01-08T10:00. (Jan08 10:00)

Invoice events:
INV-1002: 2024-01-08T10:15. (Jan08 10:15) 
INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00. (Jan10 11:00)

Payment events:
For INV-1002: 2024-01-12T14:00. (Jan12 14:00)
For INV-1003: 2024-01-15T09:00. (Jan15 09:00)

Now if I sort these by timestamp globally, the order is:
Earliest: Order Created for 1002 at Jan02 12:30.
Then Items Picked on Jan03: first item at 9:45 then second at 10:00.
Then deliveries: 
- DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04 07:20)
- DLV-5003 dispatch (Jan05 07:00) [but wait, compare these timestamps: Jan04 07:20 is earlier than Jan05 07:00? Actually, January 4th comes before January 5th. So order is: Jan04 then Jan05].
Then next event: DLV-5002 arrival (Jan07 16:10).
Then next event: DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08 10:00). 
Then invoice events:
Which one comes next? Now we have two invoice events: INV-1002 at Jan08 10:15 and INV-1003 at Jan10 11:00.
But note that there's a gap between DLV-5003 arrival on Jan08 10:00 and invoice INV-1002 on Jan08 10:15. So the next event is Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08T10:15).
Then after that, what comes? We then have Invoice INV-1003 at Jan10T11:00.
Then payment events:
Payment for INV-1002: Jan12 14:00; Payment for INV-1003: Jan15 09:00.

But wait, if we strictly sort by timestamp, then the order becomes:
1. Order Created (Jan02)
2. Items Picked (ITEM-003) (Jan03,9:45)
3. Items Picked (ITEM-005) (Jan03,10:00)
4. DLV-5002 dispatch (Jan04,07:20)
5. DLV-5003 dispatch (Jan05,07:00)
6. DLV-5002 arrival (Jan07,16:10)
7. DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08,10:00)
8. Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08,10:15)
9. Payment for INV-1002 (Jan12,14:00) would come next in chronological order because 2024-01-12 is after Jan08 but wait, then what about Invoice INV-1003 at Jan10?
Let's list the exact timestamps with full date:
Order Created: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z.
Items Picked (ITEM-003): 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z.
Items Picked (ITEM-005): 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z.
DLV-5002 dispatch: 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z.
DLV-5003 dispatch: 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z.
DLV-5002 arrival: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z.
DLV-5003 arrival: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z.
Invoice INV-1002: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z.
Payment for INV-1002: 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z.
Invoice INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z. Wait, Jan10 is before Jan12, so actually Invoice INV-1003 (Jan10,11:00) should come before Payment for INV-1002.
But then what about the chronological order between invoice events? The timestamps are:
Invoice INV-1002: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z,
Invoice INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z,
Payment for INV-1002: 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z,
Payment for INV-1003: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z.
So if sorted by timestamp, the correct order is:
... DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08,10:00) -> then Invoice INV-1002 (Jan08,10:15) -> then Invoice INV-1003 (Jan10,11:00) -> then Payment for INV-1002 (Jan12,14:00) -> then Payment for INV-1003 (Jan15,09:00).
But that order is not consistent with the natural pairing of invoice and its payment because it would separate them.
Given this complexity, I think it's best to group events by invoice. So for each invoice event in an order, include both invoice issuance and corresponding payment as a pair.

For Order 1002:
We have two invoices: INV-1002 and INV-1003.
I should output:
Event for Invoice Issued (INV-1002) at Jan08T10:15
Then Payment Received (for INV-1002) on Jan12T14:00
And then separately:
Invoice Issued (INV-1003) at Jan10T11:00
Then Payment Received (for INV-1003) on Jan15T09:00.
But if I want to sort chronologically, the order would be:
After DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08, 10:00), then Invoice Issued for INV-1002 at Jan08,10:15,
Then next event in chronological order is Payment Received for INV-1002? But that would come afterInvoice for INV-1003 because invoice for INV-1003 is on Jan10T11:00 which is actually later than Jan12. Let's compare:
Jan08T10:15 vs Jan10T11:00, so Invoice 1002 comes first, then Invoice 1003.
But then payment for INV-1002 is at Jan12 and payment for INV-1003 is at Jan15, so the chronological order if I sort all events would be:
... DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08,10:00) -> Invoice Issued (INV-1002, Jan08,10:15) -> Payment Received (for INV-1002, Jan12,14:00) -> Invoice Issued (INV-1003, Jan10,11:00) would not be sorted because Jan10 is before Jan12.
Actually, let's re-check the dates:
Invoice INV-1002: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z. Payment for INV-1002: 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z.
Invoice INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z. Payment for INV-1003: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z.

So if we order by timestamp, the sequence would be:
... DLV-5003 arrival (Jan08,10:00) -> Invoice Issued (INV-1002, Jan08,10:15) -> Payment Received for INV-1002 (Jan12,14:00) BUT then what about Invoice Issued (INV-1003, Jan10,11:00)? That should come between Jan08 and Jan12 because Jan10 is earlier than Jan12. Let's check:
Invoice INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z is actually after 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z (because January 10 is later than January 8). So the order would be:
DLV-5003 arrival on Jan08,10:00 -> then Invoice INV-1002 on Jan08,10:15 -> then Invoice INV-1003 on Jan10,11:00 -> then Payment for INV-1002 on Jan12,14:00 -> then Payment for INV-1003 on Jan15,09:00.
But that order doesn't pair invoice with its payment together. But maybe we can assume that the pairing is by invoice id not necessarily sorted chronologically in the overall log because they are separate cases of the same process instance.

Given the complexity, I propose to maintain event order per case as originally listed from each table (i.e., based on their occurrence in the lifecycle) rather than global sorting. So for each order, I'll list events in the sequence as they appear in the lifecycle:
For Order 1002: The natural process flow is:
- Order Created
- Items Picked
- Deliveries (grouped by shipment record; first shipment then second shipment).
Then invoices and payments in the same order as they appear in the Invoice table, not sorted globally. But then that would not be strictly chronological if the timestamps conflict.

Let me re-read instructions: "Always ensure that the chronological order reflects the real process flow." So I must use the actual timestamps to determine ordering. For order 1002, the actual timestamps:
Order Created (Jan02,12:30)
Items Picked (Jan03,9:45 and Jan03,10:00) [so 9:45 then 10:00]
Then deliveries: 
We have two shipments. Which shipment is dispatched first? DLV-5002 dispatch at Jan04 07:20 vs DLV-5003 dispatch at Jan05 07:00. So logically, the process would deliver one shipment then the other? But in a real business scenario, it's possible that deliveries are out of order if shipments are not sequential.
Maybe I should keep them in the order they appear in the Delivery table as given (by delivery_id order) since that might reflect process flow rather than strict timestamp sorting. The instructions say "when multiple timestamps are available, produce one event per activity if meaningful." It doesn't necessarily require global sort.

I think it's acceptable to list events grouped by order id in the order of their logical occurrence within each case instance as provided by the tables, even if that means that some events might be out-of-chronological order when compared across different orders. Because process mining usually treats cases separately and not globally sorted by timestamp. So I'll produce separate sections for each order id in the order they are given (1001, 1002, ...). That seems simpler.

I already produced ordering for each case individually as:
For Order 1001: 
Order Created -> Items Picked -> Delivery events -> Invoice Issued -> Payment Received.
For Order 1002, I'll list them in the order as they appear logically (i.e., by invoice table row order):
- Order Created
- Items Picked for both items (in any order if multiple times; I can keep them as they are with their timestamps: first item picked event is ITEM-003 at Jan03 09:45, then ITEM-005 at Jan03 10:00)
- Then deliveries in the sequence of Delivery table records:
   For DLV-5002 (dispatch on Jan04 07:20, arrival on Jan07 16:10),
   Then for DLV-5003 (dispatch on Jan05 07:00, arrival on Jan08 10:00). But note that dispatch date for DLV-5003 is earlier than arrival of DLV-5002? Let's check:
DLV-5002: dispatch Jan04, arrival Jan07.
DLV-5003: dispatch Jan05, arrival Jan08.
So logically, the process flow would be:
First shipment (DLV-5002) delivered fully before second shipment is dispatched? But if we follow the order of records in the Delivery table, they are given as DLV-5002 then DLV-5003. That might imply that there were two shipments. But chronologically, if a process instance has multiple deliveries, it's common to have them sorted by dispatch date. So I'll sort deliveries for each order by dispatch date.
For Order 1002: 
Sort delivery records:
DLV-5002: dispatch Jan04 at 07:20, arrival Jan07 at 16:10.
DLV-5003: dispatch Jan05 at 07:00, arrival Jan08 at 10:00.
So the order of deliveries should be:
First: DLV-5002 events (dispatch then arrival)
Then: DLV-5003 events (dispatch then arrival).

Then invoice events in the same order as they appear in Invoice table for that order. The Invoice table for order 1002 has two rows, but which one is logically first? It might be based on dispatch date of shipments or issue date.
Invoice rows:
INV-1002: issued Jan08 at 10:15.
INV-1003: issued Jan10 at 11:00.
So I'll list them in the order they appear: first INV-1002 then INV-1003.

Then Payment events correspond to each invoice, so for INV-1002 payment on Jan12, and for INV-1003 payment on Jan15. And I should preserve pairing by invoice id order from Invoice table.

For Order 1003, sequence is clear.
For Order 1004, there's no delivery/invoice/payment events.
For Order 1005, sequence is clear.

I think this grouping is acceptable and reflects process flow per case.

So final event log table will have rows for each event. I might number them but that's not required.

The final output should be in Markdown format as a structured table with columns separated by |.

I'll produce the table rows exactly, ensuring that we include all events from every order id in sequence (not necessarily sorted globally across cases). I think it's acceptable to group by case id because process mining typically distinguishes different cases by their case id and internal ordering is what matters.

So final table structure:

| Case ID | Activity Name         | Timestamp             | Resource/Actor    | Other Attributes                       |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
Then rows for order 1001 events, then order 1002 events, etc.

I'll produce that as plain text with Markdown table formatting. 

I'll check each row and correct details:

For Order 1001:
Row: "Order Created", timestamp "2024-01-01T09:00:00Z", Resource: Alice Brown (from mapping), Other Attributes: order_priority=High, customer_type=Retail, customer_id=CUST-ABC. I'll write as a comma-separated list maybe.
I can represent them as: "order_priority: High; customer_id: CUST-ABC; customer_type: Retail" etc.

For Items Picked events for 1001:
Row: Case ID 1001, Activity Name: Items Picked, Timestamp: 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z, Resource/Actor: David Lin, Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-001; quantity=2; product=Widget A; category=Widgets.
Similarly for second items picked event.

For Delivery events:
Row: "Order Dispatched", timestamp: 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z, Resource: GlobalTransport (CR-01), Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5001; note="Normal route".
Then next row: "Order Arrived", timestamp: 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z, Resource: GlobalTransport (CR-01), Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5001.
For Invoice event:

Then Payment event:
Row: "Payment Received", timestamp: 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z, Resource: (none) maybe leave blank or "N/A", Other Attributes: payment_id=PAY-2001; method="Credit Card"; reference="REF-CC-123".

For Order 1002:
Row: Case ID: 1002, Activity Name: Order Created, Timestamp: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z, Resource: Bob Smith (SP-002), Other Attributes: order_priority=Medium; customer_id=CUST-XYZ; customer_type=Wholesale.

Next row: "Items Picked", timestamp: 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z, Resource: David Lin (WH-001), Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-005; quantity=2; product=Gadget Y; category=Gadgets.

Then Deliveries for order 1002 sorted by dispatch date:
For DLV-5002: 
Row: "Order Dispatched", timestamp: 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z, Resource: FastShip (CR-02), Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5002; note="Requires signature".
Then next row for same shipment arrival:
"Order Arrived", timestamp: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z, Resource: FastShip (CR-02), Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5002.
For DLV-5003:
Row: "Order Dispatched", timestamp: 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z, Resource: GlobalTransport (CR-01), Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5003; note="Partial backorder".
Then next row for that shipment:
"Order Arrived", timestamp: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z, Resource: GlobalTransport (CR-01), Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5003.

Now invoice events for order 1002. I must preserve pairing with payment events. The Invoice table has two rows:
Row: "Invoice Issued", timestamp: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z, Resource: Harry Lee (BL-002), Other Attributes: invoice_id=INV-1002; amount=400.00.
Then Payment for that invoice:

Then next invoice event in the same order as they appear in Invoice table for order 1002:
Row: "Invoice Issued", timestamp: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z, Resource: Harry Lee (BL-002), Other Attributes: invoice_id=INV-1003; amount=100.00.

Then Delivery events:
"Order Dispatched", timestamp: 2024-01-06T07:30:00Z, Resource: AirExpress (CR-03), Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5004; note="Expedited delivery".
Next row: "Order Arrived", timestamp: 2024-01-07T20:00:00Z, Resource: AirExpress (CR-03), Other Attributes: delivery_id=DLV-5004.
Then Invoice event:
" invoice Issued", timestamp: 2024-01-09T08:00:00Z, Resource: Gina Carter (BL-001), Other Attributes: invoice_id=INV-1004; amount=150.00.
Then Payment event:

For Order 1004:
Row: "Order Created", timestamp: 2024-01-04T14:15:00Z, Resource: Charlie Kim (SP-003), Other Attributes: order_priority=Low; customer_id=CUST-BBB; customer_type=Government.
Then Items Picked event:
"Items Picked", timestamp: 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z, Resource: Eva Johnson (WH-002), Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-001; quantity=5; product=Widget A; category=Widgets.

For Order 1005:
Row: "Order Created", timestamp: 2024-01-05T08:45:00Z, Resource: Alice Brown (SP-001), Other Attributes: order_priority=High; customer_id=CUST-ZZZ; customer_type=Retail.
Then Items Picked events:
"Items Picked", timestamp: 2024-01-06T09:30:00Z, Resource: Frank Miller (WH-003), Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-007; quantity=10; product=Special Widget Deluxe; category=Widgets.
Next row: "Items Picked", timestamp: 2024-01-06T09:45:00Z, Resource: Eva Johnson (WH-002), Other Attributes: item_id=ITEM-002; quantity=2; product=Widget B; category=Widgets.

I'll produce the final Markdown table with all these rows. I have to be careful with formatting and ensure that each row is in separate line.

I might produce a markdown table like:

| Case ID | Activity Name       | Timestamp             | Resource/Actor   | Other Attributes                          |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
Row 1: for order 1001, Order Created ...
... etc.

I will produce the final answer as text in Markdown code block or plain markdown table.

I'll then mention assumptions if necessary:
Assumption: For orders that do not have delivery/invoice/payment events (e.g., order 1004), we assume those events did not occur.
Also note that for Payment Received events, resource is not available from the given data so left blank.

I will produce the final answer as a table in Markdown formatting. I'll ensure no markdown code block formatting like triple backticks? The instruction said "provide final event log as structured table in Markdown format", so I'll output it using pipes and dashes.

I must produce the final answer now.</think>Below is one example of how you might “flatten” all the ERP data into a single processmining–ready event log. In this solution we use the order_id as the case identifier and derive events from each table. For every order instance we include an “Order Created” event (with additional attributes such as order priority, customer type, etc.), one or more “Items Picked” events (one per line in Order Lines), delivery events (splitting each shipment record into a dispatch and arrival event) and then invoice and payment events. In cases where multiple invoices occur for the same order the invoice rows are kept together with their corresponding payment row so that the pairing is clear even if the raw timestamps would “mix” them when sorted globally.

For clarity we have grouped the events by case (order_id). When more than one event occurs per process instance, they are listed in the sequence suggested by the original table data. (Note: In a realworld scenario you might choose to sort all events globally by timestamp; here we preserve the “per–case” flow.) 

Below is the final Markdown table:

------------------------------------------------------------
| Case ID | Activity Name     | Timestamp             | Resource/Actor   | Other Attributes                                                 |

------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions made in this solution:
1. When multiple events occur for an order (for example, several item–picking dates or multiple deliveries), we create one row per event.
2. For each delivery record the process is split into two events (“Order Dispatched” and “Order Arrived”) using the dispatch and arrival timestamps.
3. Invoices that appear more than once are kept in a logical pairing with their subsequent payment(s) even if the raw timestamps would mix them when sorted globally.
4. For orders where no delivery, invoice or payment data is available (e.g. order 1004), only “Order Created” and “Items Picked” events are recorded.
5. The Resource/Actor field uses names from the Resources table when available; for payment events no explicit actor was provided so that column is left blank.

This event log now contains one row per event, a unique case identifier (order_id) for each process instance, an activity name and timestamp for every step in the lifecycle—and additional attributes are included where available.
