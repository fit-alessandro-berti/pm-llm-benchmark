Starting from the process structure, the first step is to capture mutual dependencies. For example, once an order is received, it must eventually go through a check for availability before anything else can happen. That makes RO and CA an equivalence pair. Similarly, once items are reserved, they must be picked; RI and PI form another equivalence. Picking is always followed by a quality check, so PI and QC are equivalent as well. After the quality check, the order must be packed, so QC and PO are equivalent. The packing step is immediately followed by generating the shipping label, so PO and GSL are equivalent. The dispatch must happen right after the label is generated, so GSL and D are equivalent. Finally, the invoicing and payment recording are tightly coupled, so IC and RP are equivalent.

For ordering, some activities are always required before others. CA must always occur before RI, QC, PO, GSL, and D. QC must always occur before PO, GSL, and D. PO must always occur before GSL and D. GSL must always occur before D. RP must always occur after IC.

Some activities can never be done together in the same case: RO and RI cannot happen together because items are only reserved after checking availability. RO and PI cannot happen together because picking only starts after reservation. RO and QC cannot happen together because quality checking only starts after picking. RO and PO cannot happen together because packing only starts after quality checking. RO and GSL cannot happen together because the shipping label is only generated after packing. RO and D cannot happen together because dispatch only happens after the label is generated. RI and PI cannot happen together because picking is the immediate next step after reservation. RI and QC cannot happen together because quality checking only happens after picking. RI and PO cannot happen together because packing only happens after quality checking. RI and GSL cannot happen together because the shipping label is only generated after packing. RI and D cannot happen together because dispatch only happens after the label is generated. PI and QC cannot happen together because quality checking is the immediate next step after picking. PI and PO cannot happen together because packing only happens after quality checking. PI and GSL cannot happen together because the shipping label is only generated after packing. PI and D cannot happen together because dispatch only happens after the label is generated. QC and PO cannot happen together because packing is the immediate next step after quality checking. QC and GSL cannot happen together because the shipping label is only generated after packing. QC and D cannot happen together because dispatch only happens after the label is generated. PO and GSL cannot happen together because the shipping label is the immediate next step after packing. PO and D cannot happen together because dispatch only happens after the label is generated. GSL and D cannot happen together because dispatch is the immediate next step after generating the label.

The occurrence counts are straightforward: RO, CA, IC each occur exactly once; RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D each occur exactly once; RP occurs exactly once.

Finally, the directly-follows constraints capture the immediate sequence: RO is directly followed by CA, CA by RI, RI by PI, PI by QC, QC by PO, PO by GSL, GSL by D, and IC by RP.
