### 1. Identification of Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, we first calculate the **total resolution time** for each case, which is the duration between "Receive Ticket" and "Close Ticket". 

Here are the calculations for each case:

- **Case 101**  
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:00  
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:15  
  - Total Resolution Time: **2 hours, 15 minutes**

- **Case 102**  
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05  
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15  
  - Total Resolution Time: **25 hours, 10 minutes**

- **Case 103**  
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:10  
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:30  
  - Total Resolution Time: **1 hour, 20 minutes**

- **Case 104**  
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20  
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30  
  - Total Resolution Time: **24 hours, 10 minutes**

- **Case 105**  
  - Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25  
  - Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30  
  - Total Resolution Time: **49 hours, 5 minutes**

**Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**:
- Case 102 (25 hours, 10 minutes)
- Case 104 (24 hours, 10 minutes)
- Case 105 (49 hours, 5 minutes)  
  - Case 105 stands out as having the longest resolution time by far.

The average resolution time for all cases is approximately **(2h15m + 25h10m + 1h20m + 24h10m + 49h5m) / 5  20 hours, 20 minutes**. Cases 102, 104, and 105 are significantly above this average.

### 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

#### a. Presence of Escalations (Level-2 Agent Involvement)
- **Cases with Escalations**:  
  - Case 102: Escalated to Level-2 Agent at 2024-03-01 11:30.  
  - Case 105: Escalated to Level-2 Agent at 2024-03-01 09:10.  
- **Observation**: Both cases with escalations have much longer resolution times compared to cases without escalations (Cases 101 and 103).  
- **Possible Cause**: Escalations indicate that the issue is more complex and may require specialized knowledge. However, the process after escalation seems slow:  
  - Case 102: There is a 2.5-hour delay between escalation and investigation by Level-2, and the ticket is resolved only the next day.  
  - Case 105: There is a 29-hour delay between escalation and Level-2 investigation, and the ticket takes 3 days to resolve overall.  

#### b. Long Waiting Times Between Activities
- **Case 102**:  
  - After "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:00), the next activity ("Escalate") is at 11:30 (2.5-hour delay).  
  - After "Escalate", the next activity ("Investigate Issue") is at 14:00 (another 2.5-hour delay).  
  - After "Investigate Issue", the ticket is resolved only at 09:00 the next day (19-hour delay).  
- **Case 104**:  
  - After "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:30), "Investigate Issue" is at 13:00 (3.5-hour delay).  
  - After "Investigate Issue", the ticket is resolved only at 08:00 the next day (19-hour delay).  
- **Case 105**:  
  - After "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:00), "Investigate Issue" is at 09:10 (10-minute delay).  
  - After "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (09:10), the next "Investigate Issue" is at 2024-03-02 14:00 (53-hour delay).  
- **Observation**: Significant delays occur after escalations or initial investigations, suggesting bottlenecks in resource allocation or task prioritization.

#### c. Unnecessary Delays Before Investigation and Resolution Steps
- **Case 102**:  
  - The "Investigate Issue" step by Level-2 Agent takes 2.5 hours after escalation, but resolution is delayed until the next day.  
  - This suggests that either the Level-2 Agent is overloaded or the issue requires additional coordination.  
- **Case 105**:  
  - After escalation, there is a 53-hour delay before Level-2 investigation, indicating a severe bottleneck.  
  - After Level-2 investigation, resolution takes another 19 hours.  

### 3. How These Factors Lead to Increased Cycle Times and Recommendations

#### **Root Causes Leading to Increased Cycle Times**:
1. **Escalation Backlogs**:  
   - Escalated tickets sit for hours or even days before being addressed by Level-2 Agents.  
   - This could be due to limited availability of specialized agents or poor prioritization of escalated tickets.  

2. **Long Investigation Delays**:  
   - After assignment or escalation, there are significant delays before investigation begins (e.g., 3.5 hours in Case 104, 2.5 hours in Case 102, 53 hours in Case 105).  
   - This suggests inefficiencies in task scheduling or resource allocation.  

3. **Overnight Delays**:  
   - In Cases 102, 104, and 105, resolved tickets are closed only the next morning, indicating potential oversight or inattention to timely closure.  

#### **Recommendations**:
1. **Improve Escalation Handling**:  
   - Assign dedicated Level-2 Agents or ensure proper staffing to avoid backlogs.  
   - Implement a priority queue for escalated tickets to reduce wait times.  

2. **Optimize Task Scheduling**:  
   - Reduce delays between assignment and investigation by improving workflow coordination.  
   - Use alerts or automated reminders for agents when tickets await action.  

3. **Monitor and Reduce Overnight Delays**:  
   - Ensure that resolved tickets are closed promptly, even if resolution occurs late in the day.  
   - Consider shift rotations to cover investigations and closures outside standard hours.  

4. **Analyze Escalation Triggers**:  
   - Investigate why certain tickets are escalated (e.g., lack of training for Level-1 Agents).  
   - Provide additional training or tools to reduce unnecessary escalations.  

5. **Track and Report Bottlenecks**:  
   - Implement real-time dashboards to monitor wait times and escalations.  
   - Regularly review performance data to identify recurring issues.  

### **Summary of Key Findings**:
- Cases 102, 104, and 105 had significantly longer resolution times due to escalations and subsequent delays.  
- The main bottlenecks appear after escalation (Level-2 Agent involvement) and between "Assign Agent" and "Investigate Issue."  
- Recommendations focus on improving escalation handling, reducing delays, and optimizing task scheduling.  

By addressing these issues, the support process can become more efficient and reduce average resolution times.
