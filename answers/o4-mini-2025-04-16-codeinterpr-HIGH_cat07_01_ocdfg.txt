This is a multi-lane “process map” showing how five different document streams (Purchase Requisition, Sales Order, Purchase Order, Vendor Invoice and Return Order) flow through a set of common activities, with volumes and average step-to-step times annotated on every link.  

Top row (inputs):  
 • PurchaseRequisitionItem (2 M objects)  Start  300 ms  Create Requisition (3 M objects)  
 • SalesOrderItem (3.5 M)  Start  400 ms  Create Order (8.5 M)  
 • PurchaseOrderItem (5 M)  Start  350 ms  Create Order  
 • VendorInvoiceItem (1.2 M)  Start  (green) 600 ms  Approve Requisition (5.7 M)  
 • ReturnOrderItem (0.8 M)  Start  (red) 450 ms  Approve Requisition  

Central hub:  
 • Create Requisition, Create Order and the two upstream starts all feed into Approve Requisition (5.7 M objects).  

From Approve Requisition the map splits into three colored sub-processes:  
  1. Purple path (Purchase requisition  procurement)  
     – 200 ms  Send Order (5.2 M)  150 ms  End  
     – 500 ms  Check Stock (1 M)  120 ms  Approve Payment (1.5 M)  500 ms  Create Invoice (2 M)  180 ms  End  

  2. Blue path (Sales order  fulfillment  invoice)  
     – 400 ms from Create Order  Pack Goods (2 M)  300 ms  Ship Goods (1.8 M)  200 ms  Confirm Delivery (1.7 M)  220 ms  Close Order (1.7 M)  100 ms  End  

  3. Green/red path (Returns and vendor invoices)  
     – 650 ms  Process Return (0.8 M)  10 ms (red) back into Approve Requisition loop, and also  
     – 800 ms (green)  Approve Payment  Create Invoice  End  

Key at bottom-left:  
 • Purple = Purchase­Requisition flows  
 • Blue = SalesOrder flows  
 • Green = VendorInvoice flows  
 • Red = ReturnOrder flows  

Every rectangle shows the total object count that ever passed through it, every arrow is labeled with the average latency in milliseconds, and each oval marks a Start or End node.
