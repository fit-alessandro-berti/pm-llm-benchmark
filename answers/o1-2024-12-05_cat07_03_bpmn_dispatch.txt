The visualization appears to be a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that outlines the workflow steps for preparing and dispatching goods from a computer hardware shop. It shows how different roles or departments (represented by separate horizontal “lanes”) coordinate to move an order from the decision phase to the shipment stage.

**Key Elements of the Diagram:**

1. **Pools and Lanes:**  
   - The diagram has separate lanes—one labeled “Logistics” and one for the “Warehouse.”  
   - Each lane corresponds to a role, department, or business unit involved in the process. For example, tasks performed by the shop’s secretary might appear in the “Logistics” lane, while packing and moving tasks are in the “Warehouse” lane.

2. **Start and End Events:**  
   - The process likely begins when there is a need to “Ship goods” (this might be represented by a start event symbol at the left side).  
   - The final goal is “Shipment prepared” (an end event symbol on the right side).

3. **Activities (Tasks):**  
   - Activities are represented by rounded rectangles. For instance:  
     - “Clarify shipment method” might mean determining if standard or special shipping procedures are needed.  
     - “Check if insurance is required” shows a decision point related to the value or fragility of the goods.  
     - “Write package label” and “Get 3 offers from logistic companies” detail steps needed to prepare and finalize shipment arrangements.  
     - “Package goods” and “Fill out shipment paperwork” are tasks performed, likely by the warehouse staff.

4. **Gateways (Decision Points):**  
   - Diamond-shaped symbols represent gateways that control the flow of the process. For example:  
     - A gateway after “Ship goods” might split the flow based on certain conditions (e.g., whether special handling is needed).  
     - Another gateway after “Check if insurance is required” might determine if a parcel should be insured.  
   - These gateways ensure the process takes different paths depending on conditions like “Special handling?” (yes/no) or “If insurance necessary.”

5. **Sequence Flows:**  
   - Arrows show the order in which activities and decisions take place. The main flow moves from left to right.  
   - The diagram also shows branches going down into the Warehouse lane, indicating which tasks are done there (e.g., packaging the goods) and how long they might take (“48 hours” is noted next to one task).

6. **Data Artifacts and Information Sources:**  
   - There’s a mention of “Order details” and “Customer information,” indicating that the tasks might require referencing external data.  
   - A document symbol near “Clarify shipment method” represents order details being used for decision-making.

7. **Intermediate Steps and Delays:**
   - “Notify customer about delay” shows how the process handles exceptions, such as the packaging taking longer than expected.  
   - “Get 3 offers from logistic companies” and “Select logistic company and place order” show a procurement-like step before final dispatch.

8. **End-to-End Process:**
   - Ultimately, once the parcel is insured (if needed), properly labeled, the best logistic company is chosen, and the items are packaged and documented, the goods are moved to the pickup area, and the shipment is considered prepared (the end event).

**In Summary:**  
This BPMN diagram is a structured visual representation of the steps involved in dispatching goods from a computer hardware shop. It divides responsibilities among different roles, highlights decision points (such as whether special handling or insurance is required), includes timing constraints (e.g., packaging takes 48 hours), and shows how information (like logistic company offers) feeds into the shipping process. It helps stakeholders understand the workflow, identify responsibilities, and see where improvements or clarifications might be needed.
