### 1. Normative Rule Violations

- **Case 2:** This case violates two normative rules.
  - The **Risk Assessment** was performed before the **Credit Check**, which contradicts the rule that a Credit Check must occur before a Risk Assessment.
  - After the loan was rejected, the case still proceeded to **Finalize Documentation**, which is not allowed according to the rules.

### 2. Desiderata Violations

- **Case 3:** This case fails to meet two desiderata conditions.
  - The **Credit Check** was completed more than 24 hours after the application was received, violating the recommended timing for this activity.
  - The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision, which is later than the recommended prompt notification.
- **Case 3** also lacks a **Follow-up Call** before closing the case, which, while not mandatory, is considered a best practice.

### 3. Interpretations and Justifications

- **For Case 2's Normative Violations:**
  - The out-of-order **Risk Assessment** and **Credit Check** might indicate a misunderstanding of the process rules or an attempt to expedite the process, which led to a deviation from the required sequence.
  - The **Finalize Documentation** after rejection could be a mistake or an oversight, failing to follow the decision logic properly.

- **For Case 3's Desiderata Violations:**
  - The delayed **Credit Check** might be due to workload issues, staff availability, or external factors affecting the credit checking process. While it doesn't violate strict rules, it indicates potential for improvement in efficiency or resource allocation.
  - The late notification of the applicant could be due to similar reasons affecting the internal workflow or communication processes. It suggests a need for better time management or prioritization of tasks.
  - The absence of a **Follow-up Call** might be an oversight or a decision based on the specifics of the case where it was deemed unnecessary. However, including it could enhance customer service and ensure alignment with the applicant's expectations.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- **Process Training:** Ensure all staff are well-versed in the normative rules and understand the importance of sequence and decision logic in the loan application process.
- **Efficiency Improvements:** Analyze the causes of delays in activities like Credit Checks and applicant notifications to implement improvements, possibly through better resource allocation, technology, or workflow adjustments.
- **Adherence to Desiderata:** While not mandatory, encourage the inclusion of best practices like timely Credit Checks, prompt applicant notifications, and Follow-up Calls to enhance the quality of service and applicant satisfaction.
- **Monitoring andFeedback:** Regularly monitor the process for both normative and desiderata compliance, using feedback from staff and applicants to identify areas for improvement and implement changes to better align with both the rules and the recommended best practices.
