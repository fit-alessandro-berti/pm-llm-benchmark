Model 1 analysis
What it encodes
- Post -> Screen
- Screen -> Decide
- Screen -> Interview
- Decide -> Onboard
- Onboard -> Payroll
- Payroll -> Close
- No explicit edge from Interview to Decide

Key anomalies (relative to normative flow)
- Interview independence from decision: Interview is allowed to occur after Screen, but there is no required dependency that the interview results must influence Make_Hiring_Decision. Because there is no edge from Interview to Decide, Decide can happen without considering interview outcomes. This is a fundamental integrity violation: the hiring decision could be made without having completed the core evaluation (the interviews).
- Missing rejection/alternative paths: The model assumes a single, linear progression to hire and then onboard/payroll. If the outcome is negative (no hire or a failed interview), there is no explicit alternative path (e.g., reject candidate, loop back to screening, or close the case earlier). This reduces realism and control-flow fidelity.
- No explicit linkage of interview to the decision (severity: high): The absence of a dependency from Interview to Decide is the strongest anomaly, because it contradicts the core logic that interview results should inform the hiring decision.
- Optionality of later steps is not explicit: Payroll must follow Onboard, and Close follows Payroll, which is reasonable, but there is no explicit mechanism to handle not-hiring scenarios or to terminate earlier than Payroll if no candidate is viable.

Overall assessment for Model 1
- Anomalies are real and significant, with the most severe being the possibility to Decide without considering Interview results.
- The overall structure still preserves the main phase ordering (planning  screening  decision  onboarding  payroll  close), but the essential decision-making integrity is broken by the missing linkage to interviews.
- Relative to the normative process, Model 1 is flawed in a targeted, high-impact way, but it is not as structurally divergent as Model 2.

Model 2 analysis
What it encodes
- Post
- Screen
- Interview
- Decide
- A loop_onboarding: LOOP(Onboard, skip)
- An XOR payroll: XOR(Payroll, skip)
- Close
- Edges: Post -> Screen; Post -> Interview; Interview -> Decide; Decide -> loop_onboarding; loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll; xor_payroll -> Close

Key anomalies (relative to normative flow)
- Parallel interview/screen with premature decision possibility: The model allows Decide after either Screen or Interview (there are edges Screen -> Decide and Interview -> Decide). This means a hire decision can be made after only screening or after only interviewing, without guaranteeing that both evaluation tracks have been completed or reconciled. That undermines information completeness and decision quality.
- LOOP on onboarding (potential multiple onboarding iterations): The LOOP between Onboard and a silent skip implies onboarding could be repeated multiple times. In a Hire-to-Retire process, onboarding is typically a one-time activity for a new hire. A loop here is a strong deviation from normative practice and can distort process semantics and resource usage.
- XOR payroll (option to skip payroll): The XOR between Payroll and skip allows ending the flow without adding the employee to payroll. Payroll is typically an essential step for a hired employee; skipping payroll is a severe deviation in terms of process integrity and financial/HR controls.
- Post -> Interview independent from Screen: While parallel activities are not inherently wrong, the existence of Post -> Interview alongside Post -> Screen, and then having Decide depend on either path, reinforces the premature decision issue and dilutes the intended sequencing (interviews and screening are usually integrated parts of a single evaluation cycle).
- Overall severity (compared to Model 1): The combination of premature decision, looped onboarding, and optional payroll makes Model 2 structurally farther from the normative Hire-to-Retire flow than Model 1. These are not just minor deviations; they fundamentally alter process control and the guarantees of a proper hire.

Which model aligns more with a normative Hire-to-Retire process?
- Model 1 is closer to the normative sequence. It preserves the canonical progression of stages (screening and interviewing precede the hiring decision, which then leads to onboarding, payroll, and closing). The principal issue in Model 1 is the missing dependency that ties Interview to the Make_Hiring_Decision, which is a clear, fixable integrity problem. Other omissions (e.g., explicit rejection paths) are typical modeling gaps but do not distort the basic phase order as aggressively as Model 2.
- Model 2 deviates more severely on three fronts (premature decision, onboarding loop, and optional payroll), and its combination of these anomalies makes it much harder to reconcile with a normative Hire-to-Retire process. Even though it attempts to reflect parallel evaluation streams (screening and interviewing), the lack of a consistent requirement that both streams inform the decision, plus the loop and XOR constructs, create a largely inconsistent workflow.

Suggested improvements (high-level)
- For Model 1:
  - Add Interview -> Decide (or a more explicit Merge/Join/Confluence requiring the results of interviews to influence the hiring decision).
  - Introduce explicit rejection/outcome branches (e.g., Not_Hired -> Close, or Rework -> Screen) to reflect negative outcomes.
  - If desired, separate a possible “not selected” path from the main flow without breaking Close semantics.
- For Model 2:
  - Remove or constrain the onboarding LOOP (prefer a single Onboard step) or make the loop explicitly tied to a real re-onboarding scenario with clear conditions.
  - Make payroll mandatory (remove the optional XOR) or replace XOR with a more realistic gating (e.g., Payroll must occur if Hire is successful).
  - Ensure the Decide node is conditioned on the completion of both evaluation streams (e.g., an explicit synchronization join that requires both Screen and Interview results to be ready before Decide).
  - Consider removing the separate Post -> Interview path or, if kept, ensure that Interview and Screen are clearly coordinated so that Decide is not allowed to happen until both streams contribute to the decision.

Bottom line
- The model that most closely matches a normative Hire-to-Retire process is Model 1, because it preserves the essential phase order and finalization steps, with the main flaw being that interview results do not deterministically influence the hiring decision.
- Model 2 introduces deeper integrity problems (premature decision, looping onboarding, optional payroll) that disproportionately distort process correctness and governance, making it less faithful to a standard Hire-to-Retire workflow.
- Concrete next steps would be to fix the missing Interview-to-Decide linkage in Model 1 (and add a rejection path), and to remove or constrain the pathological elements in Model 2 (or replace them with realistic, guarded alternatives).
