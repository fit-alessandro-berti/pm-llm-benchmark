To create a comprehensive event log from the given tables, we need to integrate the data from each table and derive meaningful events for each order. Below is the structured event log in Markdown format:

```markdown

### Assumptions:
1. Each order has a unique `order_id`.
2. The `order_date` in the `Orders` table is the timestamp for the "Order Created" event.
3. Each `item_picking_date` in the `Order Lines` table represents an "Items Picked" event.
4. The `delivery_dispatch_date` and `delivery_arrival_date` in the `Delivery` table represent "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events, respectively.
5. The `invoice_issue_date` in the `Invoice` table represents an "Invoice Issued" event.
6. The `payment_date` in the `Payments` table represents a "Payment Received" event.
7. The `resource_id` in the `Resources` table is used to map the responsible person or entity for each event.

This event log captures the lifecycle of each order from creation to payment, ensuring chronological correctness and including all relevant events and attributes.
