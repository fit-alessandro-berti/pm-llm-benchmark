Here’s a structured list of open-ended questions designed to clarify, probe, and deepen your understanding of the property onboarding process. The questions are grouped by thematic areas for logical flow, though you may adapt the order based on the conversation’s direction.

---

### **1. Process Overview & High-Level Clarification**
- Can you walk me through the *entire* onboarding process again, but this time focusing on the **key milestones** and **decision points** where the process could branch or stall?
- What are the **most critical steps** in this process? Are there any that, if delayed or failed, would cause the entire onboarding to halt or require a complete restart?
- How long does the *typical* onboarding process take from initial landlord contact to first tenant move-in? What factors cause it to take longer or shorter?

---

### **2. Roles, Responsibilities, and Hand-offs**
- Who are the **primary stakeholders** involved at each stage of the process? Can you describe their roles and how they interact (e.g., property coordinator vs. property manager vs. compliance officer)?
- How is the **dedicated property manager** assigned? What criteria weigh most heavily in this decision (e.g., workload, specialization, landlord preferences)?
- Are there **overlaps or conflicts** in responsibilities between teams (e.g., marketing vs. compliance vs. finance)? How are these resolved?
- Who owns the relationship with the **landlord** throughout the process? Does this shift at any point (e.g., from coordinator to manager)?
- How are **external partners** (e.g., inspectors, photographers, contractors) integrated into the process? Who manages their coordination?

---

### **3. Documentation & Compliance**
- What **specific documents** are required for onboarding, and why? Are there city/state-specific variations in these requirements?
- How do you handle cases where the landlord’s documentation is **incomplete, outdated, or non-compliant**? Is there a formal escalation process?
- Who is responsible for **verifying compliance** with local housing regulations (e.g., safety codes, fair housing laws)? How often are these checks performed?
- If an inspection reveals **major issues**, how are repairs prioritized and tracked? Who authorizes additional costs or delays?

---

### **4. Decision Criteria & Exceptions**
- What are the **key factors** considered when setting the **rental price range**? How is this negotiated with the landlord if their expectations differ from market data?
- How do you handle **landlord requests for custom lease clauses** (e.g., pet policies, maintenance responsibilities)? Is there a formal approval process for these?
- What happens if a property requires **special insurance** (e.g., for luxury units or high-risk areas)? Who identifies this need and how is it addressed?
- How are **tenant screening decisions** made when multiple applicants are qualified? Are there prioritization rules (e.g., longer lease terms, higher credit scores)?
- What are the **most common exceptions or roadblocks** you encounter in onboarding? How are they typically resolved?

---

### **5. Timing, Sequencing, and Dependencies**
- Is the process **linear** (step-by-step) or **parallel** (e.g., marketing starts before inspections are complete)? Where do dependencies create bottlenecks?
- How do you **schedule the photographer and inspector**? Is this done sequentially or can they overlap? What happens if one is delayed?
- When does the **lease agreement finalization** happen relative to tenant selection? Is it signed before or after the move-in date is confirmed?
- How is the **move-in date** determined? Are there buffers for delays (e.g., tenant background checks, repairs)?

---
### **6. Technology & Communication**
- What **tools or systems** are used to track the onboarding process (e.g., CRM, project management, email)? How do teams collaborate across these platforms?
- How is **communication** managed between landlords, property managers, and internal teams? Are there standardized templates or check-ins?
- Are there **automated alerts or notifications** for key steps (e.g., missing documents, inspection failures)? Who receives these?
- How do you ensure **data consistency** across the central property database, marketing materials, and lease agreements?

---
### **7. Quality Checks & Audits**
- Who conducts the **final quality checks** before a property is activated for rent? What specifically are they verifying?
- How often are **internal audits** performed on the onboarding process itself (e.g., to check for inefficiencies or compliance gaps)?
- What happens if an audit reveals **errors or omissions** (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing disclosures in the lease)? Who fixes it and how?
- Are there **post-move-in reviews** to assess whether the onboarding process met expectations (e.g., tenant satisfaction, landlord feedback)?

---
### **8. Landlord & Tenant Experience**
- How do you **measure landlord satisfaction** with the onboarding process? Are there feedback mechanisms in place?
- What **support is provided to landlords** after onboarding (e.g., ongoing communication, dispute resolution)? Who owns this?
- How do you **communicate delays or changes** to landlords or tenants? Is there a formal process for this?
- Have you encountered cases where a landlord or tenant **disputed the onboarding process** (e.g., lease terms, pricing)? How were these resolved?

---
### **9. Scalability & Bottlenecks**
- How does the process adapt when onboarding **multiple properties simultaneously** (e.g., in a new city or during high demand)?
- What are the **biggest bottlenecks** in the current process? Are there steps that could be streamlined or automated?
- How do you **train new hires** on the onboarding process? Are there documented workflows or playbooks?
- Have you considered **outsourcing** any part of the process (e.g., inspections, tenant screening)? If so, what were the pros/cons?

---
### **10. Future Improvements**
- If you could **redesign the process** from scratch, what would you keep the same and what would you change?
- Are there **emerging trends** (e.g., tech, regulations) that might impact how you onboard properties in the future?
- How do you **track process improvements** over time? Are there metrics (e.g., time-to-onboard, landlord satisfaction scores) that help identify areas for optimization?

---
### **Follow-Up Probes (Use as Needed)**
- *"Can you give me an example of a time when [specific scenario] happened? How was it handled?"*
- *"Who typically makes the call when [decision point] arises?"*
- *"How do you balance [competing priorities, e.g., speed vs. compliance] in this process?"*
- *"What’s the most frustrating part of this process for you or your team?"*
