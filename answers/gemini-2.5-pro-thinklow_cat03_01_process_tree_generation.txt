Based on the detailed description, the complex hospital patient management process can be modeled with the following process tree. The overall structure is a main sequence (->) that connects several smaller blocks representing different stages of the patient's journey.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process tree construction:

1.  **Initial Sequence (Arrival to Intake):** The process starts with a strict sequence of Arrival (A), Registration (RG), and Intake Assessment (IA).
    -   `->( 'A', ->( 'RG', 'IA' ) )`

2.  **Triage Sequence:** This is followed by the triage process, which is also a sequence of Triage Interview (TI) and Triage Classification (TC).
    -   `->( 'TI', 'TC' )`

3.  **Initial Diagnostic Choice:** After triage, an exclusive choice (X) is made between a Comprehensive ECG (CE) and a Full Blood Panel (FBP).
    -   `X( 'CE', 'FBP' )`

4.  **Treatment and Re-Diagnostic Loop:** This is the most complex part, modeled with a loop operator (\*). The loop body (`A` in `*(A, B)`) consists of a sequence containing a specialist consultation, an exclusive treatment choice, and an exclusive re-diagnostic test choice. The loop repeats until results are normal. This is a "do-while" style loop, which can be modeled by setting the "redo" part of the loop (`B` in `*(A, B)`) to a silent step (`tau`), meaning the main body `A` is simply repeated.
    -   Loop Body: `->( 'SC', ->( X('TM', 'SPT'), X('FCE', 'FBA') ) )`
    -   Full Loop: `* ( ->( 'SC', ->( X('TM', 'SPT'), X('FCE', 'FBA') ) ), tau )`
    -   *(Note: The activity 'RDT' is described as being the exclusive choice itself, not a separate leaf. Therefore, `X('FCE', 'FBA')` represents the RDT step.)*

5.  **Concurrent Advanced Procedures:** After the loop, two activities, Advanced Imaging (AI) and Nutritional Counseling (NC), are performed in true concurrency (+).
    -   `+( 'AI', 'NC' )`

6.  **Final Informational Sequence:** This is followed by a sequence of scheduling a Follow-up Appointment (FAS) and providing Detailed Discharge Instructions (DDI).
    -   `->( 'FAS', 'DDI' )`

7.  **Final Concurrent Administrative Tasks:** The entire process concludes with three administrative tasks—Billing (BL), Insurance Claims Processing (ICP), and Medical Records Finalization (MRF)—that are performed in true concurrency.
    -   `+( 'BL', +( 'ICP', 'MRF' ) )`

### Final Process Tree Notation

Combining all the sequential blocks results in the final, complete process tree. The main operator is a sequence (`->`) that connects each of the 7 stages described above.

```
-> (
    -> ( 'A', -> ( 'RG', 'IA' ) ),
    -> (
        -> ( 'TI', 'TC' ),
        -> (
            X ( 'CE', 'FBP' ),
            -> (
                * (
                    -> ( 'SC', -> ( X ( 'TM', 'SPT' ), X ( 'FCE', 'FBA' ) ) ),
                    tau
                ),
                -> (
                    + ( 'AI', 'NC' ),
                    -> (
                        -> ( 'FAS', 'DDI' ),
                        + ( 'BL', + ( 'ICP', 'MRF' ) )
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```
