Explanation of the transformation

1. Case identification  
   - The user is clearly working on two different Word files.  
   - All activity between the first opening of “Document1.docx” and its closure is treated as one case (C-01).  
   - After Document1 is closed, the user switches attention to “Quarterly_Report.docx”; every event from its first focus until its closure is grouped into a second case (C-02).  
   - Cross-application tasks (email, PDF, Excel) that occur while Document1 is still open are considered supporting steps inside C-01, because they are interleaved with edits to that document and logically belong to the same work session.

2. Activity naming  
   Low-level actions are mapped to business-friendly labels:  
   - FOCUS on a new window  “Open document” (first time the window appears in the case).  
   - TYPING  “Draft text” (or “Update budget” for Excel).  
   - SAVE  “Save document”.  
   - CLOSE  “Close document”.  
   - Replying to an e-mail is abstracted to “Reply to e-mail”; scrolling/highlighting are hidden because they do not change the state of the process.  

The resulting log is small but coherent: two complete document-editing processes ready for discovery, conformance, or performance analysis in any standard process-mining tool.
