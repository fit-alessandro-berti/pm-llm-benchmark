The picture is a process-flow diagram that blends five different object types flowing through a shared “order-to-cash / procure-to-pay” process.

1. Object types and volumes (shown in small header boxes at the top):
   • VendorInvoiceItem – 1.2 M  
   • ReturnOrderItem – 0.8 M  
   • PurchaseRequisitionItem – 2.0 M  
   • SalesOrderItem – 3.5 M  
   • PurchaseOrderItem – 5.0 M  

   Each object starts in its own “Start” event (small ovals) and is drawn in a distinct colour that stays consistent through the diagram.

2. Activities (rounded rectangles):
   • A central activity, “Approve Requisition” (overall 5.7 M executions), acts as the main hub: four of the five object types converge on it and then branch out again.
   • Down-stream activities cover the typical life-cycle of an order:
       – “Send Order”, “Check Stock”, “Approve Payment”, “Create Invoice” on the left/centre.
       – “Create Order”, “Pack Goods”, “Ship Goods”, “Confirm Delivery”, “Close Order” on the right.
       – “Process Return” handles return items.
   • Each activity caption contains “Overall: x M”, the total number of times that step was performed for all objects.

3. Arrows / connectors:
   • The arrows show the sequence in which an object moves from one step to the next.
   • Each arrow carries an average transfer time label (e.g., 400 ms, 650 ms). Longer numbers hint at slower transitions.
   • The colour of the arrow matches the colour of its object type, letting you follow one object’s journey without confusion.

4. Start and end:
   • Every object has its own oval “Start” and “End”.  
   • Some objects finish after short paths (e.g., VendorInvoiceItem can go straight to “Create Invoice”  End), whereas SalesOrderItem traces a longer fulfilment chain ending with “Close Order”.

5. What the picture tells you at a glance:
   • PurchaseOrderItem (dark blue) is the most frequent object (5 M) and follows a path of Start  Approve Requisition  Send/Check/Invoice steps.
   • SalesOrderItem (orange) dominates the logistics branch: Create Order  Pack  Ship  Confirm Delivery  Close Order.
   • ReturnOrderItem (red) is comparatively small and only touches “Process Return” after the main approval.
   • The bottleneck appears to be “Approve Requisition” (highest load and multiple incoming/outgoing flows).
   • Transition times are generally short (hundreds of milliseconds), but “Process Return” (800 ms) and parts of the “Approve Payment” path (500 ms+) are the slower parts.

In short, this visualization is a multi-object process map that shows how five object classes interact and diverge through a combined procure/fulfil/pay workflow, highlighting volumes, routing, and average waiting times for each step.
