The picture is an objectcentric process map that stitches together five different but interrelated object classes into one coherent “superprocess”.  
Color, numbers, symbols and routing all carry meaning.

1. Object classes (top row – one colour each)  
   • Green – VendorInvoiceItem(1.2 M objects)  
   • Red – ReturnOrderItem(0.8 M)  
   • Purple – PurchaseRequisitionItem(2.0 M)  
   • Orange – SalesOrderItem(3.5 M)  
   • Blue – PurchaseOrderItem(5.0 M)  

   Each class starts with its own Start event (small ellipse) and then feeds into the flow through a line in “its” colour.

2. Activities (rounded rectangles in the middle)  
   • Boxes contain the activity name and a grey line “Overall: …” that tells how many activity executions were seen in the log, e.g.  
     – Create Order8.5 M executions (largest node)  
     – Approve Requisition5.7 M  
     – Send Order5.2 M  
   • Dots on the left of a box show which object classes participate in that activity.  
     Example: “Create Order” has two dots (blue + orange) meaning it involves PurchaseOrderItems and SalesOrderItems.

3. Edges / connectors  
   • The line colour tells which object class is travelling along that path.  
   • The label on the line is the average time between the two activities for that object class (in milliseconds).  
     Example: On the blue line it takes on average 350 ms from PurchaseOrderItem “Start” to “Create Order”.  
   • Whenever several colours merge into one box, different object instances meet at that activity (e.g., three colours merge into “Approve Requisition”).

4. Highlevel story of the flow  
   a. Purchaseside  
      – PurchaseRequisitionItems (purple) are Created  Approved  may be Sent to a supplier, Checked for stock, then go through Payment approval and Invoice creation.  
   b. Salesside  
      – SalesOrderItems (orange) are Started  Create Order  Pack Goods  Ship Goods  Confirm Delivery  Close Order.  
   c. Returns  
      – ReturnOrderItems (red) start, join “Approve Requisition”, then go to “Process Return” and eventually End.  
   d. Invoicing & payment  
      – VendorInvoiceItems (green) start, join the common flow at “Approve Payment”, lead to “Create Invoice” and then End.

5. End events (bottom row)  
   Each object class terminates in its own End ellipse after its last activity; some classes have several possible finishing points (e.g., three separate Ends for different sales/return/payment terminations).

6. Volume & performance hotspots  
   • “Create Order” and “Approve Requisition” are the busiest nodes (8.5 M and 5.7 M).  
   • The slowest average waiting times visible are ~800 ms between “Process Return” and “Approve Payment”; the quickest are ~100 ms from “Close Order” to End.  

In short: the visualisation shows, in one picture, how purchasing, sales, returns, invoicing and payment objects interact, how many times each step occurs, and how long it typically takes to move from one step to the next for every object class involved.
