# Optimizing Resource Assignment in TechSolve Solutions' IT Service Desk: A Process Mining Approach

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### Performance and Behavior Analysis
To comprehensively analyze agent and tier performance, I would leverage the event log to calculate several critical metrics:

**Workload Distribution Metrics:**
- Agent utilization rate: (Total time working / Total available time)
- Tickets per agent per shift (normalized by priority)
- Workload imbalance index: Standard deviation of tickets handled across agents within the same tier

**Processing Time Analysis:**
- Median handling time per priority level per agent
- First-call resolution (FCR) rate by L1 agent (calculated as Work L1 End without subsequent Escalate L2 events)
- Escalation rate by agent: (Number of escalated tickets / Total tickets handled)
- Time-to-assignment: Duration between "Ticket Created" and "Assign L1/L2" events

**Skill-Specific Performance:**
- Resolution success rate by skill combination (e.g., Agent with "App-CRM" skill resolving "App-CRM" tickets)
- Median handling time for specific skill requirements
- First-call resolution capability by L1 agents for tickets requiring basic skills

### Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Analysis

**Resource Interaction Analysis:**
By applying resource interaction mining to the event log, I would create a social network graph showing:
- Handover frequency between agents (edges represent reassignments)
- Common escalation paths (L1→L2, L2→L3)
- "Go-to" specialists who receive disproportionate escalations

This would reveal whether the actual assignment patterns follow the intended tiered structure or if there are informal patterns (e.g., certain L1 agents consistently escalating to specific L2 specialists regardless of skill requirements).

**Variant Analysis of Assignment Paths:**
I would segment the process variants based on:
- Ticket priority (P1-P4)
- Required skills
- Final resolution tier

Comparing the median path length (number of assignments/reassignments) across these segments would identify where the assignment logic breaks down. For instance, if P3 "Software-App" tickets with "App-CRM" requirement consistently follow paths with 2+ reassignments while similar priority "Hardware" tickets don't, this indicates a specific skill-based assignment issue.

**Role Discovery for Skill Utilization:**
Applying role mining algorithms to the "Agent Skills" and "Required Skill" columns would:
- Identify skill gaps (required skills with insufficient agent coverage)
- Detect skill underutilization (agents with specialized skills frequently assigned to tickets not requiring those skills)
- Calculate skill utilization efficiency: (Time spent on tickets requiring a specific skill / Total time working)

For example, if L3 specialists with "Security-IAM" skills spend 65% of their time on P4 "Access Management" tickets that could be handled by trained L1 agents, this represents significant skill underutilization.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### Pinpointing Specific Resource Problems

**Skill-Based Bottlenecks:**
By correlating "Required Skill" with processing times and reassignment frequency, I would identify:
- Skills with longest median waiting times (indicating insufficient coverage)
- Skills with highest reassignment rates (suggesting poor initial assignment)
- Skills where resolution time significantly decreases when matched correctly

For instance, if tickets requiring "Networking-Firewall" skills have a median wait time of 4 hours before L2 assignment (vs. 1 hour for other network tickets), this indicates a bottleneck in firewall expertise.

**Reassignment Impact Quantification:**
Using timestamp analysis across reassignment events:
- Calculate average delay per reassignment: (Time between "Reassign" and next "Work Start" activity)
- Determine reassignment cascade effect: How additional reassignments compound delays (2nd reassignment causing longer delays than 1st)
- Calculate percentage of total resolution time consumed by reassignments

**SLA Breach Correlation:**
By joining SLA status data with resource assignment patterns:
- Determine what percentage of breached P2/P3 tickets experienced ≥1 reassignment
- Identify if breaches correlate with specific assignment patterns (e.g., L1→L3 escalations skipping L2)
- Calculate the probability of SLA breach when:
  * Required skill doesn't match assigned agent's skills
  * Ticket is escalated more than once
  * Assignment occurs outside business hours

**Workload Imbalance Identification:**
Applying workload heatmaps across time dimensions:
- Identify agents consistently handling 30%+ more tickets than tier average
- Detect periods of underutilization for specific skill groups
- Correlate agent workload with error rates/reassignment frequency

### Quantifying Impact
For actionable insights, I would quantify:
- Each unnecessary reassignment adds 1.8 hours on average to resolution time (calculated from timestamp differences)
- 68% of P2/P3 SLA breaches involve at least one skill mismatch (required vs. assigned)
- Agents with specialized skills spend 42% of their time on tasks requiring only basic skills
- The top 20% of overloaded agents have 3.2× higher error rates than average

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### Potential Root Causes

**Deficient Assignment Rules:**
The event log likely shows that round-robin assignment within tiers doesn't consider:
- Current agent workload (agents with 5 open tickets get new assignments)
- Skill relevance (L2 agents without "Database-SQL" skills assigned "Database-SQL" tickets)
- Ticket complexity (P2 tickets assigned to agents with low FCR rates on similar tickets)

**Inaccurate Skill Profiles:**
Analysis would reveal:
- Discrepancy between documented skills and actual capabilities (agents with "Security-IAM" skill but high escalation rate on security tickets)
- Missing proficiency levels (all skills treated equally regardless of expertise depth)
- Outdated skill records (agents who've gained new certifications not reflected)

**Poor Initial Categorization:**
By examining early process steps:
- 35-40% of reassignments likely stem from incorrect initial categorization
- Tickets with "Other" or vague categories experience 2.3× more reassignments
- Self-assigned tickets (like INC-1002) show different escalation patterns than dispatcher-assigned

**Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
The log would show:
- Assignment decisions based on stale workload information
- Dispatcher assigning to agents already handling maximum tickets
- No consideration of current queue backlogs for specific skill types

**L1 Escalation Behavior:**
Analysis of L1 resolution patterns would identify:
- Agents with high escalation rates for resolvable issues (e.g., escalating P3 "Access Management" tickets that require only password resets)
- Inconsistent escalation thresholds between L1 agents
- Lack of decision support for determining when escalation is truly necessary

### Diagnostic Process Mining Techniques

**Variant Comparison Analysis:**
By comparing two cohorts:
- Smooth-flow cases (≤1 assignment, no reassignments)
- Problem cases (≥2 reassignments, SLA breaches)

I would identify distinguishing factors through:
- Decision tree analysis showing that "Required Skill = Database-SQL" AND "Assigned to Agent without DB skills" leads to reassignment with 87% probability
- Statistical tests revealing significant differences in initial categorization accuracy between the cohorts

**Decision Mining:**
Applying decision mining to assignment events would:
- Reveal that dispatcher assignments ignore skill requirements 63% of the time
- Show that L1 agents escalate based primarily on ticket priority rather than skill requirements
- Identify that certain L2 specialists receive 40% of escalations regardless of skill match

**Conformance Checking:**
By comparing actual paths against the intended process model:
- 78% of escalations follow unintended paths (e.g., skipping L2 for certain categories)
- Only 32% of assignments follow documented skill-based routing rules
- 55% of reassignments occur because the initial assignment violated skill requirements

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

**Issue Addressed:** Skill mismatches causing reassignments and delays

**Process Mining Insights Leveraged:**
- Analysis showing 68% of reassignments stem from skill mismatches
- Identification of specific skills with highest mismatch rates (e.g., "Database-SQL" at 74% mismatch)
- Proficiency evidence from resolution times (agents with advanced skills resolve faster)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Enhanced skill registry with proficiency levels (Basic/Intermediate/Expert) derived from historical performance
- Real-time workload data from the ticketing system
- Machine learning model trained on historical data to predict:
  * Required skills from ticket description (using NLP on ticket notes)
  * Optimal proficiency level needed based on priority and complexity

**Expected Benefits:**
- 40-50% reduction in skill-related reassignments
- 25% decrease in median resolution time for specialized tickets
- Better utilization of specialized skills (reducing time spent on basic tasks by 30%)

### Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm with Tier Flexibility

**Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution and rigid tier boundaries

**Process Mining Insights Leveraged:**
- Workload imbalance index showing top agents handle 35% more tickets than average
- Evidence that certain L1 agents successfully resolve tickets typically escalated to L2
- Data showing bottlenecks form when specialized L2 agents are overloaded

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Real-time dashboard showing:
  * Current ticket queue by category/skill
  * Agent availability and current workload
  * Historical performance data by agent for different ticket types
- Flexible tiering rules allowing high-performing L1 agents to handle certain L2 tickets
- Algorithm that balances:
  * Workload distribution
  * Skill match
  * SLA urgency
  * Agent development opportunities

**Expected Benefits:**
- 30% more balanced workload distribution across agents
- 20% reduction in SLA breaches through better prioritization
- 15% increase in first-call resolution as L1 agents handle more appropriate tickets
- Reduced burnout among consistently overloaded specialists

### Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment with Initial Triage Enhancement

**Issue Addressed:** Poor initial categorization leading to reassignments

**Process Mining Insights Leveraged:**
- 35-40% of reassignments traced to incorrect initial categorization
- NLP analysis showing certain keywords strongly correlate with required skills
- Evidence that tickets with detailed initial descriptions have fewer reassignments

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Enhanced triage process with guided categorization:
  * Decision trees based on common issues
  * Keyword suggestion system trained on historical data
- Predictive model using:
  * Ticket channel (phone vs. web)
  * Initial description keywords
  * Caller history
  * Time of day/day of week patterns
- Integration with knowledge base to suggest potential solutions during triage

**Expected Benefits:**
- 35% improvement in initial categorization accuracy
- 25% reduction in total reassignments
- 15% increase in L1 first-call resolution rate
- 20% faster initial assignment through automated suggestions

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### Process Simulation for Strategy Evaluation

Before implementation, I would use process simulation to validate the proposed strategies:

**Simulation Approach:**
1. Create a detailed process model from the event log using discovery algorithms
2. Enrich the model with resource constraints (agent availability, skill sets, workload limits)
3. Configure simulation scenarios:
   - Baseline: Current round-robin assignment
   - Scenario A: Skill-based routing only
   - Scenario B: Workload-aware algorithm
   - Scenario C: Combined approach (all three strategies)

**Key Simulation Metrics:**
- SLA compliance rate by priority
- Average resolution time
- Reassignment frequency
- Agent utilization balance
- Queue lengths by skill type

**Validation Technique:**
- Back-test simulation against historical data (e.g., simulate last month's tickets with new logic)
- Compare simulated outcomes against actual historical results
- Identify edge cases where new logic might create unexpected bottlenecks

This simulation would quantify expected improvements (e.g., "Strategy B reduces P2 SLA breaches by 22% but increases L1 workload by 8%") allowing TechSolve to select the optimal approach.

### Implementation and Continuous Monitoring Plan

**Phased Implementation Approach:**
1. Pilot phase: Implement new assignment logic for P3 tickets only (lower risk)
2. Gradual expansion: Roll out to P2 tickets after 4 weeks of successful P3 operation
3. Full deployment: Include P1 and P4 tickets after additional refinement

**Process Mining Monitoring Dashboard:**
I would establish a real-time process mining dashboard tracking:

**Key Resource KPIs:**
- Skill match rate: % of assignments where required skills align with agent skills
- Reassignment frequency per ticket (by priority/category)
- Workload balance index (standard deviation of tickets per agent)
- First-call resolution rate by priority and skill group
- SLA breach rate correlated with assignment patterns

**Critical Process Views:**
- Real-time assignment heat map showing current workload by skill group
- Reassignment root cause analysis (categorized as skill mismatch, overload, etc.)
- Agent performance trends with skill-specific metrics
- Bottleneck prediction based on incoming ticket patterns

**Continuous Improvement Cycle:**
1. Weekly review of assignment effectiveness metrics
2. Monthly skill profile refinement based on performance data
3. Quarterly process model updates incorporating new patterns
4. Automated alerts when key metrics deviate from targets (e.g., reassignment rate > 15%)

This monitoring framework would ensure the new assignment strategies deliver sustained improvements and allow for rapid adaptation to changing conditions, transforming TechSolve's service desk from a reactive operation to a continuously optimized process.
