Based on the data provided, I can identify several differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups in the loan application process. Here are some notable differences:

1. Frequency of loan denials: The protected group has a higher frequency of loan denials compared to the unprotected group. For instance, the most frequent process variant for the protected group is "Application Rejected," with a frequency of 960, while the most frequent process variant for the unprotected group is "Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement," with a frequency of 1656.
2. Additional process steps: The protected group has several process variants that involve more steps than the unprotected group. For instance, some of the protected group's process variants include "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" and "Request Co-Signer On Loan" multiple times, while the unprotected group's process variants do not have such repetitions.
3. Performance time: The protected group's process variants generally have longer performance times compared to the unprotected group's process variants. This is evident in the average performance times for each group. The protected group's average performance time is 208,332.23, while the unprotected group's average performance time is 106,670.69.
4. Skipped examination: The unprotected group has a process variant that involves skipping the examination step, which is not present in the protected group's process variants. This may indicate a difference in the level of scrutiny applied to the two groups.
5. Request for co-signer: The protected group has several process variants that involve requesting a co-signer on the loan. This is not present in the unprotected group's process variants. This may indicate that the protected group is perceived as higher risk, and therefore requires additional assurances before a loan can be approved.

Overall, these differences suggest that there may be unfair treatment of the protected group in the loan application process, with longer processing times, more stringent requirements, and higher rates of loan denials.
