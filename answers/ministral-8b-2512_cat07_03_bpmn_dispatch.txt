The diagram is a swimlane flowchart depicting the process of shipping goods from a computer hardware shop. It is divided into three swimlanes representing different roles: Dispatch of goods, Computer Hardware Shop Secretary, and Warehouse. The process begins with the 'Ship goods' event, followed by clarifying the shipment method. If special handling is required, the process involves getting offers from logistic companies and selecting one to place an order. The order details are then checked for insurance requirements, and if necessary, the parcel is insured. The package is labeled, and paperwork is filled out. The goods are packaged, and if there's a delay, the customer is notified. Finally, the package is moved to the pickup area, marking the shipment as prepared. The diagram illustrates the sequential and conditional steps involved in the shipping process, emphasizing the roles and interactions between different departments to ensure efficient and accurate shipment handling.
