The main differences between the two groups are:

* The number of visits to the emergency room (ER) vs. the family doctor (FD).
* The number of different types of examinations.
* The number of treatments.
* The number of diagnoses.
* The number of successful treatments.
* The number of unsuccessful treatments.
* The number of diagnoses of specific conditions.

Here is a breakdown of the differences:

**Number of visits:**

* The unprotected group visited the ER more often than the protected group.
* The unprotected group visited the FD more often than the protected group.

**Number of examinations:**

* The unprotected group had more different types of examinations than the protected group.
* The unprotected group had more thorough examinations than the protected group.

**Number of treatments:**

* The unprotected group had more treatments than the protected group.
* The unprotected group had more successful treatments than the protected group.
* The unprotected group had more unsuccessful treatments than the protected group.

**Number of diagnoses:**

* The unprotected group had more diagnoses than the protected group.
* The unprotected group had more diagnoses of specific conditions than the protected group.

**Number of diagnoses of specific conditions:**

* The unprotected group had more diagnoses of specific conditions than the protected group.

These differences suggest that the unprotected group may be more likely to have more severe health conditions than the protected group. They may also be more likely to require more care and treatment. It is important to note that these are just some of the differences between the two groups and there may be other factors that contribute to these differences.
