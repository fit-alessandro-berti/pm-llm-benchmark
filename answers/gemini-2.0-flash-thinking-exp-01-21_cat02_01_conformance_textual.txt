**Analysis of Event Log Cases against Normative Process Description:**

Let's analyze each case in the event log and compare it to the normative process description to identify any violations.

**Case 1:**

| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1       | 2023-10-05 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 11:00    | Authorize payment  |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 12:00    | Package items      |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 13:00    | Ship order         |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 14:00    | Close order        |

* **Analysis:** This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order. This sequence perfectly matches the described normative process for when "inventory is found to be sufficient."
* **Violation:** None. Case 1 adheres to the normative process.

**Case 2:**

| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2       | 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory    |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 10:00    | Package items      |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order        |

* **Analysis:** This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.  This deviates from the normative process.
* **Violation:**  **Violation of Activity Order:** The normative description states, "Authorize payment' should only occur after 'Check inventory' and *before packaging*." In Case 2, "Authorize payment" occurs *after* "Package items." This violates the rule that payment authorization should precede packaging. The description clearly specifies the intended order as "Authorize Payment, Package items."

**Case 3:**

| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory    |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment  |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order       |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 10:30    | Ship order         |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order        |

* **Analysis:** This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order. This sequence contains several deviations from both the sufficient and insufficient inventory paths.
* **Violations:**
    * **Violation of Cancellation Path:** If inventory is insufficient (leading to cancellation), the normative description dictates the sequence should be "Receive, Check, Cancel, Close."  Case 3 includes "Authorize payment" *before* "Cancel order," which is not part of the described cancellation path. It implies a scenario where inventory was initially considered sufficient (hence payment authorization), but then the order was cancelled, which is not explicitly described in the normative process.
    * **Violation of "Ship order" after Cancellation:** The description explicitly states, "Ship order' should only occur after packaging and *never after a cancellation*." In Case 3, "Ship order" occurs *after* "Cancel order." This is a direct violation of the rule against shipping after cancellation.

**Case 4:**

| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:10    | Check inventory    |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:20    | Cancel order       |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:50    | Close order        |

* **Analysis:** This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order. This sequence perfectly matches the described normative process for when "inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order."
* **Violation:** None. Case 4 adheres to the normative process for insufficient inventory.

**Case 5:**

| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 5       | 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order        |

* **Analysis:** This case follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order. This sequence is missing the "Package items" activity, which is expected in the fulfillment path between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order."
* **Violation:** **Missing Activity:** The normative description states, "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" Case 5 skips the "Package items" activity between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order," directly proceeding to shipping after payment authorization. This violates the expected sequence of activities in the fulfillment process.

**Summary of Violations:**

1. **Case 2: Violation of Activity Order:** "Authorize payment" occurs after "Package items" instead of before.
2. **Case 3: Violation of Cancellation Path and "Ship order" after Cancellation:** Includes "Authorize payment" before cancellation (not in described cancellation path) and performs "Ship order" after "Cancel order," which is explicitly prohibited.
3. **Case 5: Missing Activity:** "Package items" activity is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order."

**Cases that violate the normative process:** Cases 2, 3, and 5.
**Cases that adhere to the normative process:** Cases 1 and 4.
