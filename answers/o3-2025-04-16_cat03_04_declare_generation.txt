The dictionary covers:

• Mandatory start and end points (IG, FL)  
• The core design-to-launch flow (DD  TFC  CE  AG  MP  FL)  
• Prototype/testing loop (PC  LT and LT  UT)  
• Direct-next-step rules where the business requires no intervening tasks (e.g., PC followed immediately by LT)  

All support values are set to 1.0 (full support) and, for simplicity, every rule is assumed to hold with 100 % confidence in this illustrative model.
