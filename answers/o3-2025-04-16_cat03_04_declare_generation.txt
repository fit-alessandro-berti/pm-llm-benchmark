Below is one possible DECLARE specification – expressed exactly in the Pythondictionary format expected by pm4py – that captures a reasonable set of constraints for the described productdesign and launch process.  
(Every support value is fixed to 1.0, the confidence is assumed to be 1.0 as well.)

```python
declare_model = {
    # ------------- singleactivity constraints -------------
    # every case starts with an Idea Generation
    'init': {
        'IG': (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # at least one Approval Gate and one Final Launch must occur
    'existence': {
        'AG': (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # the product is launched exactly once
    'exactly_one': {
        'FL': (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # no activity is totally forbidden in this scenario
    'absence': {},

    # ------------- binary constraints ----------------------
    # if a prototype is created, laboratory testing must also occur
    'responded_existence': {
        ('PC', 'LT'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # laboratory and user testing always accompany each other
    'coexistence': {
        ('LT', 'UT'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('UT', 'LT'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # once the technical feasibility check is done, a cost evaluation must eventually follow
    'response': {
        ('TFC', 'CE'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # a product cannot reach the approval gate unless a cost evaluation was performed before
    'precedence': {
        ('AG', 'CE'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # idea generation is eventually followed by a design draft, and a design draft is always preceded by an idea generation
    'succession': {
        ('IG', 'DD'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # each usertesting activity is (eventually) followed by exactly one approval gate
    'altresponse': {
        ('UT', 'AG'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # a final launch is preceded by at most one approval gate
    'altprecedence': {
        ('FL', 'AG'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # once the prototype is created, it is eventually followed by at most one marketingplan activity
    'altsuccession': {
        ('PC', 'MP'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # laboratory testing must occur immediately after a prototype is created
    'chainresponse': {
        ('PC', 'LT'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # every usertesting activity is immediately preceded by laboratory testing
    'chainprecedence': {
        ('UT', 'LT'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # approval gate is immediately followed by a marketing plan
    'chainsuccession': {
        ('AG', 'MP'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # ------------- negative constraints --------------------
    # a case that starts with idea generation may not skip directly to final launch without the intermediate steps
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('IG', 'FL'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # it is forbidden for the cost evaluation to be immediately followed by another idea generation
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('CE', 'IG'): (1.0, 1.0)
    },

    # laboratory testing must never be immediately followed by a new idea generation
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        ('LT', 'IG'): (1.0, 1.0)
    }
}
```

The dictionary contains all 18 keys required by pm4py’s DECLARE representation; for keys where no constraint is needed in this scenario an empty dictionary is provided.
