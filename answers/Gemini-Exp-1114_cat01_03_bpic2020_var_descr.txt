Let's break down this process based on the provided data. It describes a **declaration reimbursement process** (likely expense reports or similar declarations requiring approval and payment). Here's a detailed analysis:

**Key Stages (Activities):**

* **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** The process always starts with an employee submitting a declaration.
* **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE:**  This is a preliminary step where the declaration is saved but not yet submitted. It doesn't lead to further processing in this dataset.
* **Declaration APPROVED by [Role]:** This signifies approval at various stages by different roles:
    * **ADMINISTRATION:** Appears in most variants, suggesting a general administrative review.
    * **BUDGET OWNER:**  Required in some cases, likely involving budget checks.
    * **PRE_APPROVER:**  Indicates a preliminary approval stage, possibly for specific types of declarations.
    * **SUPERVISOR:**  The final approval stage before payment. Sometimes this is done without other approvals.
* **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR:**  The ultimate approval before payment processing.
* **Declaration REJECTED by [Role]:**  Indicates rejection at different stages, requiring resubmission or potentially ending the process.
    * **ADMINISTRATION:**  Most common rejection point.
    * **BUDGET OWNER:**  Rejections based on budget constraints.
    * **SUPERVISOR:**  Final approval authority can reject.
    * **PRE_APPROVER:**  Preliminary rejection.
    * **MISSING:** Rejection due to missing information after initial approval by supervisor.
* **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE:** This occurs after a rejection by another role. It means the employee acknowledges the rejection and either corrects the declaration or abandons the request.
* **Request Payment:** The formal request to process payment after all approvals.
* **Payment Handled:**  The final stage where payment is processed and completed.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Initiation:** The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration (**Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**). In some cases, it might start with saving the declaration (**Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**).

2. **Approval Path:**
   * **Standard Path:** Typically, the declaration goes through **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** followed by **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**.
   * **Budget Approval:** Some declarations require **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER** after administration approval.
   * **Pre-Approval:** Some may require **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER** before final approval.
   * **Direct Supervisor Approval:**  In some cases, declarations directly go to **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** without other approvals.

3. **Rejection and Resubmission:** Declarations can be rejected at various stages, leading to **Declaration REJECTED by [Role]**. This is followed by **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**, indicating acknowledgment of the rejection. Subsequently, the employee often resubmits the declaration (**Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**). Multiple rejection-resubmission cycles are observed in some variants.

4. **Payment Request and Processing:** After all necessary approvals, a **Request Payment** is initiated, followed by **Payment Handled**.

5. **Process Completion:** The process ends with **Payment Handled** or when a declaration is rejected and the employee doesn't resubmit it (e.g.,  **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** after a rejection by another role).

**Key Observations:**

* **Variability:**  The process has multiple variants, indicating different paths depending on the nature of the declaration, organizational policies, or specific circumstances.
* **Rejections:** Rejections are common, particularly by administration and supervisors, which suggests potential issues in initial submission or policy adherence.
* **Performance:**  The performance times (in some arbitrary unit) vary significantly between variants, suggesting that certain paths are more efficient than others. Variants with multiple rejections have significantly longer performance times.
* **Frequency:** The frequency data shows the number of instances of each variant, highlighting the most common paths. The most frequent variant is the standard path with administration and supervisor approvals.
* **Missing Information:** The presence of **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** after final approval suggests potential gaps in initial verification or subsequent data issues.

**Possible Improvements:**

* **Streamline Approvals:** Analyze the need for multiple approval stages (especially for frequently used paths) to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for streamlining.
* **Reduce Rejections:** Investigate the reasons behind common rejections to provide better guidance to employees during initial submission. This might involve improving documentation, training, or system checks.
* **Automate Tasks:**  Identify opportunities for automating repetitive tasks, such as initial checks or payment processing, to improve efficiency.
* **Address Missing Information:** Implement measures to prevent missing information issues after supervisor approval, such as more comprehensive initial checks or system alerts.

**In conclusion, this data represents a multi-variant declaration reimbursement process with significant variability, frequent rejections, and varying performance times. Analyzing these variations can help identify areas for process improvement to increase efficiency and reduce processing time.**
