Certainly! Below is an example Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the given global supply chain process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600),         # Average delay of 1 day with standard deviation of 1 hour
    ('SS', 'RC'): (97200, 7200),         # Average delay of 1.1 days with standard deviation of 2 hours
    ('OP', 'RC'): (86400, 3600),         # Average delay of 1 day with standard deviation of 1 hour
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 1800),          # Average delay of 2 hours with standard deviation of 0.5 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (3600, 900),           # Average delay of 1 hour with standard deviation of 15 minutes
    ('CA', 'PT'): (28800, 7200),         # Average delay of 8 hours with standard deviation of 2 hours
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 900),           # Average delay of 1 hour with standard deviation of 15 minutes
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 1800),          # Average delay of 2 hours with standard deviation of 0.5 hours
    ('WS', 'DT'): (43200, 10800),        # Average delay of 12 hours with standard deviation of 3 hours
    ('DT', 'AS'): (777600, 43200),       # Average delay of 9 days with standard deviation of 12 hours
    ('SS', 'QI'): (108000, 10800),       # Average delay of 1.25 days with standard deviation of 3 hours
    ('OP', 'CA'): (97200, 7200),         # Average delay of 1.1 days with standard deviation of 2 hours
    ('RC', 'PT'): (43200, 10800),        # Average delay of 12 hours with standard deviation of 3 hours
}
```

This temporal profile includes a variety of activity pairs and provides estimated average times and standard deviations for each pair. These values have been chosen to reflect the typical delays that might be expected in such a supply chain process, taking into account the time required for different stages like procurement, assembly, testing, packaging, and distribution.

The average times are given in seconds, which can be easily converted into more human-readable units (e.g., days, hours) as needed. The standard deviations also provide an indication of variability in these delays, reflecting that real-world processes may deviate from the average due to various factors like supplier reliability, manufacturing efficiency, and logistical challenges.
