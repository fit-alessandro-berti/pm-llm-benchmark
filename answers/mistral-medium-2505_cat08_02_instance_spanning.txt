# **Optimization Strategy for E-Commerce Fulfillment Center Using Process Mining**

## **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

### **1.1. Formal Identification of Constraints**
To identify and quantify the impact of instance-spanning constraints, we will use **process mining techniques** such as:
- **Process Discovery (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner)** to visualize the process flow and identify bottlenecks.
- **Performance Analysis (e.g., Performance Spectrum, Bottleneck Analysis)** to measure delays caused by shared resources, batching, and priority handling.
- **Conformance Checking (e.g., Alignment-based techniques)** to detect deviations from expected behavior due to constraints.

### **1.2. Key Metrics for Constraint Impact Measurement**
| **Constraint**               | **Impact Metrics**                                                                 | **Analysis Method**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shared Cold-Packing Stations** | - Queue length at cold-packing stations <br> - Waiting time for cold-packing orders | - Resource utilization analysis <br> - Throughput vs. demand mismatch detection |
| **Shipping Batches**          | - Batch formation delay <br> - Average waiting time for batch completion          | - Batch size optimization analysis <br> - Time spent in "Shipping Label Gen."   |
| **Priority Handling (Express Orders)** | - Interruption frequency of standard orders <br> - Delay impact on standard orders | - Priority rule compliance analysis <br> - Preemption impact on throughput       |
| **Hazardous Material Limits** | - Queue length at Packing/QC for hazardous orders <br> - Throughput reduction due to regulatory limits | - Compliance monitoring <br> - Hazardous order flow analysis                     |

### **1.3. Differentiating Waiting Time Causes**
- **Within-Instance Delays:** Measured by comparing activity durations against historical benchmarks.
- **Between-Instance Delays:** Identified by tracking resource contention (e.g., cold-packing station occupancy) and batching dependencies (e.g., waiting for batch completion).

## **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**

### **2.1. Key Interactions Between Constraints**
1. **Express Orders + Cold-Packing Stations:**
   - Express orders requiring cold-packing may preempt standard orders, increasing queue lengths and delays.
   - **Impact:** Higher priority orders may monopolize limited cold-packing stations, worsening bottlenecks.

2. **Batching + Hazardous Material Limits:**
   - If multiple hazardous orders are batched for the same region, they may exceed the 10-order limit at Packing/QC.
   - **Impact:** Delays in processing hazardous orders due to regulatory constraints.

3. **Priority Handling + Batching:**
   - Express orders may bypass batching rules, leading to suboptimal shipping routes.
   - **Impact:** Increased shipping costs and potential delays for standard orders.

### **2.2. Importance of Understanding Interactions**
- **Holistic Optimization:** Addressing one constraint in isolation may worsen another (e.g., prioritizing express orders may starve standard orders).
- **Trade-off Analysis:** Balancing express order speed vs. standard order throughput requires understanding cross-constraint effects.

## **3. Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

### **3.1. Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations**
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations
- **Proposed Changes:**
  - Implement a **priority-aware scheduling algorithm** that dynamically allocates cold-packing stations based on:
    - Order urgency (express vs. standard).
    - Predicted demand (using historical data).
  - Introduce **buffer stations** for overflow during peak times.
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Reduced waiting time for cold-packing orders.
  - Better utilization of limited resources.

### **3.2. Adaptive Batching with Hazardous Order Constraints**
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shipping Batches + Hazardous Material Limits
- **Proposed Changes:**
  - Modify batching logic to:
    - **Cap hazardous orders per batch** to avoid exceeding regulatory limits.
    - **Trigger batch formation dynamically** (e.g., when a critical mass of orders for a region is reached).
  - Use **predictive analytics** to forecast hazardous order volumes and adjust batch sizes.
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Faster batch formation without violating regulatory limits.
  - Reduced delays for hazardous orders.

### **3.3. Priority-Aware Preemption with Fairness Rules**
- **Constraint Addressed:** Priority Handling (Express Orders)
- **Proposed Changes:**
  - Implement **controlled preemption rules** where:
    - Express orders can interrupt standard orders, but only if the delay impact is below a threshold.
    - Standard orders are **rescheduled** rather than fully preempted to minimize disruption.
  - Use **simulation-based testing** to optimize preemption thresholds.
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Faster express order fulfillment without excessive delays for standard orders.

  - Resource contention (cold-packing stations).
  - Batching delays.
  - Priority interruptions.
  - Hazardous material limits.

- **Feedback loops** from warehouse staff to refine strategies.
