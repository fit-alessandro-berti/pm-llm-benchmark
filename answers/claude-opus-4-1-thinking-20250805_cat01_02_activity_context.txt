## Analysis of Recurring Activities

After examining the event log, I've identified three activities that appear multiple times within cases and carry different contextual meanings:

1. **"Verify Documents"** - appears twice in cases C001 and C003
2. **"Call Customer"** - appears twice in case C002, and has different purposes across all cases
3. **"Adjust Account"** - appears in C002 and C003 with different contexts

## Justification of Naming Choices

### 1. **Verify Documents  Split into two variants:**
- **"Verify Documents - Initial Check"**: First occurrence in each case, represents the standard verification step
- **"Verify Documents - Re-verification"**: Second occurrence, always happens after an intermediate action (additional document submission or account adjustment)
- **Contextual clues**: Position in sequence, preceding events (Submit Additional or Adjust Account), and the "re-checks" language in descriptions

### 2. **Call Customer  Four context-specific variants:**
- **"Call Customer - Request Missing Docs"** (C001): Follows incomplete initial verification
- **"Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy"** (C002, first): Purpose is to resolve account issues
- **"Call Customer - Confirm Adjustments"** (C002, second): Follow-up after account changes
- **"Call Customer - Request Return"** (C003): Unique branch scenario where customer stepped out
- **Contextual clues**: Preceding/following activities, additional context descriptions, and resource involved

### 3. **Adjust Account  Two variants:**
- **"Adjust Account - Post-Clarification"** (C002): Follows a clarification call
- **"Adjust Account - Missing Info Correction"** (C003): Internal correction not triggered by customer interaction
- **Contextual clues**: Preceding events and explicit context about the nature of adjustment

### 4. **Initiate Request  Three channel-specific variants:**
- **"Initiate Request - Web Portal"**: Online submissions (C001, C002)
- **"Initiate Request - Branch Walk-in"**: In-person at branch (C003)
- **Contextual clues**: Resource field and additional context clearly indicate the channel

These renamed activities now clearly distinguish between different instances of the same general activity, making the process flow more transparent and enabling better process analysis and optimization.
