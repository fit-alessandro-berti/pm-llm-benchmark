Below is a structured approach tailored to Speedy Parcels’ last-mile delivery challenges using process mining. This approach covers data preparation, process discovery and conformance checking, performance and bottleneck analysis, root cause analysis, data-driven optimizations, and ongoing monitoring under operational constraints.


1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

a) Data Preprocessing and Integration  
• Data Integration:  
– Collect data streams from GPS trackers, handheld scanners (delivery milestones), dispatch planning systems, and maintenance logs.  
– Align timestamps by establishing a common time zone and ensuring accurate synchronization across systems.  
– Map and merge identifiers (e.g., Vehicle ID, Driver ID, Case ID [operational day]) to link related events.  
– Normalize data formats (e.g., date-time formats, location values) and fill any missing values with appropriate imputations or flags.  
• Challenges:  
– Heterogeneous data sources may have varying precision, missing fields, or inconsistent logging intervals.  
– Synchronizing multiple event streams in real time may require handling delays, time drift, or occasional data gaps.  
– Data noise like false stops (e.g., engine warnings not leading to actual maintenance) could complicate the process model if not filtered.

b) Process Discovery Using Process Mining Algorithms  
• Use algorithms like the -algorithm, Heuristics Miner, or fuzzy mining to construct an actual “as-is” process model.  
• The model will illustrate the flow from depot departure through multiple delivery stops, waiting/delay events (e.g., low-speed traffic, unscheduled stops), and maintenance events, ending with depot return.  
• Include variant paths such as successful deliveries, failed attempts (i.e., ‘Delivery Failed’ events), and instances of maintenance or unscheduled stops.  
• Visualize timing details (e.g., dwell times at customer stops, travel durations, and vehicle idle times).

c) Conformance Checking Against Planned Routes  
• Compare the discovered (“actual”) process model to the planned routes provided by the dispatch system.  
• Look for deviations such as:  
– Sequence deviations: Out-of-order stops or changes in planned stop sequence that indicate route reordering.  
– Unplanned stops: Additional stops for maintenance or unexpected engine warnings.  
– Timing deviations: Significant differences in travel times, dwell times, or delays during specific segments relative to planned benchmarks (e.g., prolonged stops at customer locations or idle times due to traffic).  
– Failed delivery events that require re-planning.  
• Use conformance metrics (e.g., fitness, precision, and generalization) to quantify how closely operations adhere to planning, highlighting gaps that may signal inefficiencies.


2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

a) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
• On-Time Delivery Rate: Calculate the percentage of deliveries performed within the customer-requested time windows by comparing scanner timestamps to planned delivery windows.  
• Average Time per Delivery Stop: Use the difference between ‘Arrive Customer’ and ‘Delivery Success/Failed’ timestamps to determine service times.  
• Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio: Compare the cumulative travel time (from GPS logs) to the service (stop) times to assess operational balance.  
• Fuel Consumption per km/package: Derive fuel consumption by linking fuel data (if available via maintenance logs or vehicle sensors) to distance traveled from GPS data.   
• Vehicle Utilization Rate: Calculate the ratio of active delivery time versus total shift duration.  
• Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays: Use ‘Low Speed Detected’ and unscheduled stops to determine the incidence and impact of traffic congestion.  
• Rate of Failed Deliveries: Compute the ratio of failed delivery attempts vis-à-vis total stops, identifying potential issues with customer availability or address errors.

b) Identifying Bottlenecks Using Process Mining Techniques  
• Bottleneck Discovery:  
– Analyze dwell time distributions at various stops, flagging stops with unusually long idle periods.  
– Use time-based process maps to pinpoint stages where waiting times or deviations occur.  
• Segmentation Analysis:  
– Break down the event logs by routes, time blocks (e.g., morning vs. afternoon), vehicle types, and individual driver performance.  
– Correlate delays with specific geographic areas (using GPS coordinates) to identify traffic hotspots or areas with frequent delays.  
• Quantification:  
– Compute average and median delays per segment.  
– Use variance analysis to compare standard route performance against outlier routes, quantifying delays, extra miles driven, or additional fuel consumption.
• Activity-specific Analysis:  
– Evaluate specifics such as parking delays, customer interaction times via scanner logs, and maintenance stop durations.  
– Map these delays to specific drivers, vehicle types, or routes to prioritize bottlenecks for operational intervention.


3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

a) Identifying Key Issues  
• Suboptimal Route Planning:  
– Static pre-planned routes may not account for real-time traffic conditions, causing route deviations or delay events.  
• Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:  
– Underestimated travel times may lead to late deliveries; discrepancies can be spotted by comparing expected travel durations from dispatch with actual travel times captured by GPS.
• Traffic Congestion:  
– Frequent “Low Speed Detected” events in specific zones may highlight predictable congestion periods or areas needing dynamic re-routing.
• Variability in Service Times:  
– Differences in service times at customer locations could arise from inefficient on-site processes or varying levels of driver-customer interaction.
• Vehicle Issues:  
– Recurrent unscheduled stops or maintenance alerts indicate that vehicle maintenance routines might not be optimally planned based on real-time usage patterns.
• Driver Behavior:  
– Differences in adherence to planned routes, speed management, or stop durations might highlight variance in driver training or skill levels.
• Failed Delivery Attempts:  
– High frequency of failed deliveries could be linked to poor communication with customers, inflexible time windows, or inaccurate customer data.

b) Process Mining Analyses for Root Cause Validation  
• Variant Analysis:  
– Compare high-performing routes/drivers with low-performing ones to identify factors (e.g., shorter dwell times, fewer deviations) driving better performance.
• Correlation Analysis:  
– Overlay traffic data (or “Low Speed Detected” events) with delivery time deviations to validate the impact of congestion.  
• Dwell Time Distribution Analysis:  
– Examine the variability in dwell times at customer stops to confirm if inconsistent customer interactions are delaying the process.  
• Maintenance Event Correlation:  
– Cross-reference unscheduled maintenance stops with specific vehicle usage patterns or routes to determine if certain conditions trigger breakdowns.  
• Temporal Analysis:  
– Analyze process performance by time of day to uncover peak delay periods that relate to external factors (e.g., rush hour traffic).


4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

a) Dynamic Routing Adjustments Based on Real-Time Traffic Data  
• Targeted Inefficiency: Addresses delays caused by static route planning and unpredictable traffic congestion.  
• Root Cause: Identified frequent “Low Speed Detected” events and prolonged dwell times in certain areas indicate traffic-induced delays.  
• Data Support: Process mining insights reveal deviations from planned routes and identify traffic hotspots. Real-time data integration allows update of routes dynamically.  
• Expected Impact: Reduced travel times, improved on-time delivery rates, and lower fuel consumption per km.

b) Optimizing Delivery Territories and Route Sequences  
• Targeted Inefficiency: Prevents inefficient allocation of stops with undue backtracking or poor cluster formation.  
• Root Cause: Unplanned route deviations and high variability in travel times suggest that static territory assignments do not reflect real-world conditions.  
• Data Support: Historical performance data and variant analysis can be used to re-cluster delivery stops into more efficient sequences.  
• Expected Impact: Increased vehicle utilization rate, improved travel-to-service time ratio, and reduction in overall operational costs (fuel, overtime).

c) Predictive Maintenance Scheduling and Targeted Driver Training  
• Predictive Maintenance Scheduling:  
– Targeted Inefficiency: Reduces unscheduled stops and associated delays due to vehicle breakdowns.  
– Root Cause: Root cause analysis of maintenance logs shows recurring patterns in vehicle issues during high usage periods.  
– Data Support: Process mining can correlate high mileage or extended shifts with maintenance events, guiding predictive models that notify timely maintenance.  
– Expected Impact: Fewer breakdowns during delivery routes, lower repair costs, and smoother overall operations.  
• Targeted Driver Training:  
– Targeted Inefficiency: Improves driver performance in adhering to routes and managing stop durations.  
– Root Cause: Variability in driver performance from variant analysis indicates some drivers may have longer dwell times or unnecessary deviations.  
– Data Support: Process mining dashboards can identify individual driver performance metrics and pinpoint training needs.  
– Expected Impact: More consistent and efficient delivery operations, improved on-time delivery rates, and reduced overtime instances.


5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

a) Accounting for Operational Constraints  
• Driver Working Hours:  
– All optimization strategies must respect regulatory and contractual limits on shift durations; dynamic routing and improved planning should be integrated with shift planning tools to prevent overtime.  
• Vehicle Capacities:  
– Route optimization must consider the load limits of each vehicle, ensuring that re-clustering of stops respects capacity constraints and safe vehicle loading practices.  
• Customer Time Windows:  
– Time-sensitive deliveries require that dynamic adjustments include customer-imposed delivery windows, with optimization algorithms balancing speed and punctuality.

b) Continuous Monitoring Using Process Mining Dashboards  
• Key Metrics to Monitor:  
– On-Time Delivery Rate: Automated alerts when on-time performance drops.  
– Average Dwell Times and Travel Durations: Dashboards showing real-time variances against planned benchmarks.  
– Fuel Consumption and Vehicle Utilization: Monitoring trends to evaluate the impact of route changes.  
– Frequency and Duration of Unscheduled Stops: Highlight potential vehicle maintenance or traffic issues.  
– Driver Performance Metrics: Comparative dashboards that flag deviations from best-practice benchmarks.  
• Process Views:  
– Real-time process flows with drill-down capability to inspect route deviations or delay bottlenecks.  
– Conformance visualizations that compare planned versus actual routes across different periods.  
– Geographic heat maps of delays to immediately spot emerging traffic congestion or route issues.
• Plan for Iteration:  
– Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to recalibrate models and adjust operational tactics based on updated data patterns.
– Integrate feedback from drivers and dispatch teams to continuously refine process mining inputs and resulting optimizations.


Conclusion

By following this comprehensive, data-driven approach, Speedy Parcels can move from reactive problem management to proactive operational optimization. The integration of high-fidelity event data with process mining techniques will illuminate underlying inefficiencies, support targeted interventions (such as dynamic re-routing, improved territory planning, predictive maintenance, and driver training), and ultimately lead to better on-time delivery performance and reduced operational costs—all while respecting the company’s operational constraints.
