To identify bias in the event logs between Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group), we need to examine the attributes and outcomes of the application processes in both groups. Specifically, we will focus on the influence of the `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` attributes, as well as the `ScoreAdjustment` column, and how these factors might lead to systematic differences in final decisions.

### Comparison of Event Logs

#### Group A (Protected Group)
- **LocalResident**: All applications in Group A have `LocalResident` set to `FALSE`.
- **CommunityGroup**: All applications in Group A have `CommunityGroup` set to `None`.
- **ScoreAdjustment**: All applications in Group A have `ScoreAdjustment` set to `0`.

#### Group B (Unprotected Group)
- **LocalResident**: All applications in Group B have `LocalResident` set to `TRUE`.
- **CommunityGroup**: Some applications in Group B are associated with a `CommunityGroup` (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club").
- **ScoreAdjustment**: Applications in Group B associated with a `CommunityGroup` receive a `ScoreAdjustment` of `+10` labeled as "Community Boost".

### Manifestation of Bias

1. **ScoreAdjustment**:
   - **Group A**: No applications receive any score adjustments.
   - **Group B**: Applications associated with a `CommunityGroup` receive a `ScoreAdjustment` of `+10`. This adjustment directly impacts the `PreliminaryScore`, potentially leading to higher scores and influencing the final decisions.

2. **CommunityGroup**:
   - **Group A**: No applications are associated with any `CommunityGroup`.
   - **Group B**: Some applications are associated with a `CommunityGroup`, which triggers the `ScoreAdjustment`. This association appears to provide an advantage to these applications.

3. **LocalResident**:
   - **Group A**: All applications are from non-local residents.
   - **Group B**: All applications are from local residents. While the `LocalResident` status itself does not directly influence the score, it seems to correlate with the likelihood of being associated with a `CommunityGroup`, which in turn influences the score adjustment.

### Systematic Differences in Final Decisions

- **Group A**:
  - **P001**: Score 720, Approved.
  - **P002**: Score 710, Rejected.
  - **P003**: Score 740, Approved.

- **Group B**:
  - **U001**: Score 720 (Adjusted to 730), Approved.
  - **U002**: Score 710, Rejected.
  - **U003**: Score 695 (Adjusted to 705), Approved.

### Analysis

- **Group A**: The decisions are based solely on the `PreliminaryScore` without any adjustments. The outcomes are consistent with the initial scores.
- **Group B**: The decisions are influenced by the `ScoreAdjustment` for applications associated with a `CommunityGroup`. This adjustment can push borderline cases over the approval threshold.

### Conclusion

The bias manifests primarily through the `ScoreAdjustment` for applications in Group B associated with a `CommunityGroup`. This adjustment systematically benefits these applications, leading to a higher likelihood of approval compared to Group A, where no such adjustments are made. The `LocalResident` status correlates with the likelihood of being associated with a `CommunityGroup`, further highlighting the systematic advantage given to Group B.

Therefore, **Group B** exhibits bias, as the `ScoreAdjustment` due to `CommunityGroup` associations provides an unfair advantage to these applications, resulting in systematic differences in final decisions compared to Group A.
