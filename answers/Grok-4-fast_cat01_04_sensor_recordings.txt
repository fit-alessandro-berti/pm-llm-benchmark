### Inferred Manufacturing Activities

Based on the event log analysis, I identified distinct patterns in the sensor readings by examining changes over time and grouping similar states using clustering techniques (K-means on normalized sensor data). This revealed five primary clusters corresponding to phases in the manufacturing process. These clusters align with sequential transitions: starting from an idle state, moving through active operations (cutting, assembling, welding), then a post-processing phase (inspection), and returning to idle.

The process appears to represent a single cycle of part fabrication on Machine M1, with events grouped as follows. Each group includes the associated events, an intuitive activity label, and a rationale derived from sensor patterns (e.g., sudden spikes in temperature and vibration indicating heat-intensive operations, steady flow and position suggesting controlled assembly).

| Activity Label | Events | Key Sensor Patterns | Rationale |
|---------------|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Standby/Idle** | 1–3, 13–15 | - Temperature: ~20–21°C (stable low)<br>- Pressure: 1 bar (low)<br>- Vibration: 0 Hz (none)<br>- Material Flow: 0 units/s (none)<br>- Tool Position: 0 mm (retracted)<br>- Energy: ~0.40–0.50 kWh (minimal) | This represents a machine at rest, preparing for or recovering from operations. All sensors show baseline/idle values with no activity indicators (e.g., no heat buildup, movement, or resource use), typical for a powered-on but inactive state between cycles. The repetition at the start and end suggests cycle boundaries. |
| **Cutting Metal** | 4–6 | - Temperature: 50–58°C (rising)<br>- Pressure: 1–1.5 bar (increasing slightly)<br>- Vibration: 30–38 Hz (high and rising)<br>- Material Flow: 5 units/s (steady high)<br>- Tool Position: 5–10 mm (advancing)<br>- Energy: 2.00–3.00 kWh (rising) | The sharp onset of elevated vibration and material flow, combined with gradual temperature increase and tool advancement, indicates a machining/cutting phase where friction generates heat and oscillation. Steady flow suggests consistent material feed, and energy ramps up to support the mechanical action—hallmarks of cutting operations. |
| **Assembling Parts** | 7–8 | - Temperature: 40°C (stable moderate)<br>- Pressure: 2 bar (elevated)<br>- Vibration: 10 Hz (low-moderate, steady)<br>- Material Flow: 2 units/s (low steady)<br>- Tool Position: 15 mm (fixed)<br>- Energy: 2.00 kWh (stable) | After cutting, the drop in vibration and flow but sustained higher pressure points to a pressing or fitting step. Stable tool position and moderate temperature (residual heat) imply alignment/assembly without aggressive motion, where pressure secures components—common in part joining without intense energy draw. |
| **Welding** | 9 | - Temperature: 80°C (sharp peak)<br>- Pressure: 2 bar (high)<br>- Vibration: 50 Hz (very high spike)<br>- Material Flow: 0 units/s (none)<br>- Tool Position: 15 mm (fixed)<br>- Energy: 5.00 kWh (peak) | A brief, intense surge in temperature, vibration, and energy with no flow suggests a localized heat-fusion process like welding. High pressure maintains alignment, and the fixed position indicates spot application—vibration from arc/electrode contact and extreme energy for melting are diagnostic of welding. |
| **Quality Inspection** | 10–12 | - Temperature: 25–30°C (cooling to low)<br>- Pressure: 1 bar (low)<br>- Vibration: 1–5 Hz (minimal)<br>- Material Flow: 0–1 units/s (trace)<br>- Tool Position: 15–20 mm (slight advance)<br>- Energy: 1.00–1.60 kWh (low-moderate) | Post-welding cooldown with minimal activity, subtle tool movement, and low vibration/flow indicates a non-destructive check (e.g., visual/sensor scan for defects). The transitional cooling and slight resource use fit inspection, ensuring quality before final handling, without the intensity of prior phases. |

### Overall Process Deduction
The sequence (Idle → Cutting → Assembling → Welding → Inspection → Idle) forms a logical linear workflow for fabricating a simple metal assembly (e.g., a bracket or frame). Transitions are evident in sensor resets (e.g., position jumps from 0 to 5 mm at cutting start, or cooldown after welding). Clustering confirmed these groups by similarity in multi-dimensional sensor space, with clear separations (e.g., welding as an outlier due to extremes). This inferred model could be validated or refined with more logs, but it captures high-level process mining from raw data.
