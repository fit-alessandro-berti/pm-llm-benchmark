### 1. Violations of Normative Rules

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** The sequence rule is violated because a "Risk Assessment" was performed before a "Credit Check". According to the normative rules, "Credit Check" must be done before "Risk Assessment".
- **Impact:** This sequence violation could lead to inaccurate risk assessment outcomes as it relies on credit information which might not have been evaluated at this point.

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** Despite a loan rejection decision, there was an attempt to finalize the documentation. According to the normative rules, "Finalize Documentation" should only occur if the loan is approved.
- **Impact:** This violates the rule and could result in unnecessary or incorrect processing steps being taken after a rejection.

### 2. Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions

**Case 3:**
- **Violation:** The Credit Check was done more than 24 hours after receiving the application, which is against the recommended best practice.
- **Impact:** While not a strict rule violation, this delay can slow down the process and affect the customer experience negatively.

**Case 3:**
- **Violation:** Applicant notification happened much later (more than 48 hours) after the loan decision was made. This exceeds the preferred time window for informing applicants.
- **Impact:** Delays in communication may lead to dissatisfaction or confusion among applicants about their application status.

### Interpretations and Justifications

**Case 2:**
- The sequence violation of performing "Risk Assessment" before "Credit Check" could be due to human error or a system misconfiguration. It is crucial to ensure that the workflow strictly adheres to the predefined order for accurate decision-making.
- The attempt to finalize documentation after rejection in Case 2 might have been an accidental step, possibly due to operator oversight. Ensuring strict adherence to conditional logic (only finalize if approved) can prevent such errors.

**Case 3:**
- Delays in "Credit Check" and notifying the applicant could be due to a backlog of applications or other operational constraints. While not ideal, these delays do not violate any critical rules but should be monitored and minimized for better service quality.
- The lack of a follow-up call in Case 3 is simply a failure to adhere to recommended best practices aimed at enhancing customer satisfaction and alignment with the process. However, it does not affect the final decision or overall processing.

In summary, while Case 2 clearly violates critical normative rules, Cases 1 and 3 only fail to meet desiderata conditions, which are more about improving service quality rather than enforcing strict procedural correctness.
