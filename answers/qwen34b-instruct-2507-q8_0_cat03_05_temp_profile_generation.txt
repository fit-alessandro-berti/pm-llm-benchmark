### **Rationale Behind the Estimates**

This temporal profile reflects realistic delays observed in a complex high-tech electronics supply chain, incorporating variability due to:

- **Supplier lead times** (e.g., `SS  OP`): Typically 1 hour to 1 day; average 1 hour (3600s), with high variability due to supplier responsiveness.
- **Procurement to receipt** (`OP  RC`): Often 12 hours to 2 days; average 2 hours (7200s), reflecting logistics and shipping delays.
- **Inspection time** (`RC  QI`): Fast and consistent; ~30 minutes (1800s), with low variability.
- **Assembly** (`QI  CA`): A major bottleneck; can take days due to precision engineering; average 12 hours (43200s), with high standard deviation due to labor, tooling, and setup.
- **Testing** (`CA  PT`): Standard 1 hour (3600s), with minor variation.
- **Packaging** (`PT  PK`): Quick and consistent (~30 minutes).
- **Storage** (`PK  WS`): Often 1–2 days depending on demand; average 2 days (7200s).
- **Distribution** (`WS  DT`): 1.5–3 days; average 3 days (10800s), subject to network congestion.
- **After-sales support** (`DT  AS`): Starts after sales cycle; average 2 days (14400s), with variability due to support volume and response times.

**Indirect pairs** (e.g., `SS  RC`, `OP  QI`) are included to reflect real-world trace data where activities may be separated by multiple steps. These are computed as the sum of the average times between intervening steps, with standard deviation propagated using root-sum-square (RSS) approximation (i.e., (² + ²)), though simplified here for clarity.

All values are in **seconds** and represent realistic, plausible delays in a high-tech manufacturing context. The standard deviations account for process variability, human error, equipment downtime, and external factors like supplier delays or transportation disruptions. 

This profile enables anomaly detection using ZETA thresholds (e.g., flagging times below `AVG - 2*STDEV` or above `AVG + 2*STDEV`), helping identify process inefficiencies or outliers in execution traces.
