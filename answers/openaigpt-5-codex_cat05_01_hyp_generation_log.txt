**Summarizing anomalies and crafting queries**

I’m identifying anomalies like events happening out of order and missing steps, and hypothesizing causes such as urgent orders or manual overrides. I’m planning to propose several specific SQL queries that analyze event sequences, missing activities, and role assignments to investigate these issues thoroughly using the provided data.
</think>
Below are several irregularities visible in the sample log, together with plausible explanations and concrete SQL queries to help you investigate similar patterns at scale.

---

## 1. Shipping before mandatory risk checks (e.g., Case 1002)

**Observed anomaly**

- `Ship Goods` occurs before both `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`.
- Credit check and stock validation happen *after* the goods have already left, which is the opposite of the assumed flow.

**Possible reasons**

- Priority-order shortcut allowing shipment before approvals.
- Workflow automation bug mis-ordering tasks.
- Human error: staff bypassing steps to meet tight shipping targets.

**Investigation query**

```sql
-- Cases where shipping takes place before credit check
SELECT oel_ship.case_id,
       oel_ship.timestamp AS ship_time,
       oel_check.timestamp AS credit_check_time,
       o.order_type,
       o.order_value
FROM order_event_log oel_ship
JOIN order_event_log oel_check
  ON oel_ship.case_id = oel_check.case_id
JOIN orders o
  ON o.case_id = oel_ship.case_id
WHERE oel_ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND oel_check.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
  AND oel_ship.timestamp < oel_check.timestamp
ORDER BY oel_ship.timestamp;

-- Cases where shipping precedes stock validation
SELECT oel_ship.case_id,
       oel_ship.timestamp AS ship_time,
       oel_stock.timestamp AS stock_time
FROM order_event_log oel_ship
JOIN order_event_log oel_stock
  ON oel_ship.case_id = oel_stock.case_id
WHERE oel_ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND oel_stock.activity = 'Validate Stock'
  AND oel_ship.timestamp < oel_stock.timestamp
ORDER BY oel_ship.timestamp;
```

---

## 2. Shipment confirmation happening after shipping (e.g., Case 1003)

**Observed anomaly**

- `Ship Goods` is logged before `Confirm Shipment`, with a “late_confirmation” flag in `additional_info`.

**Possible reasons**

- Manual confirmation after-the-fact due to backlog or system latency.
- Separate systems for shipping vs. confirmation failing to synchronize.
- Training issue: staff confirm shipments after dispatch when they remember.

**Investigation query**

```sql
-- Identify cases where confirmation happens after shipment
SELECT ship.case_id,
       ship.timestamp AS ship_time,
       confirm.timestamp AS confirm_time,
       confirm.additional_info
FROM order_event_log ship
JOIN order_event_log confirm
  ON ship.case_id = confirm.case_id
WHERE ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND confirm.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND ship.timestamp < confirm.timestamp
ORDER BY ship.timestamp;
```

---

## 3. Payment recorded before invoicing (e.g., Case 1004)

**Observed anomaly**

- `Receive Payment` logged before `Issue Invoice`.
- Credit check and stock validation appear to be missing entirely.

**Possible reasons**

- Upfront payments or deposits not supported by current workflow logic.
- Batch invoice generation that lags behind cash application.
- Process errors: finance team recording payments prematurely.

**Investigation queries**

```sql
-- Payments logged before invoices
SELECT pay.case_id,
       pay.timestamp AS payment_time,
       invoice.timestamp AS invoice_time,
       pay.additional_info AS payment_info
FROM order_event_log pay
JOIN order_event_log invoice
  ON pay.case_id = invoice.case_id
WHERE pay.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND invoice.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
  AND pay.timestamp < invoice.timestamp
ORDER BY pay.timestamp;
```

```sql
-- Cases missing credit check or stock validation altogether
WITH required_steps AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM orders
),
presence AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_credit_check,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_stock_validation
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT r.case_id,
       COALESCE(p.has_credit_check, 0) AS has_credit_check,
       COALESCE(p.has_stock_validation, 0) AS has_stock_validation
FROM required_steps r
LEFT JOIN presence p
  ON r.case_id = p.case_id
WHERE COALESCE(p.has_credit_check, 0) = 0
   OR COALESCE(p.has_stock_validation, 0) = 0
ORDER BY r.case_id;
```

---

## 4. Shipment with “not scheduled” confirmation (Case 1004)

**Observed anomaly**

- `Confirm Shipment` has `shipment_scheduled=N`, yet `Ship Goods` still follows.

**Possible reasons**

- Conflicting data entries due to double-handling or form defaults.
- Supervisor override that allowed shipment despite “not scheduled”.
- Incomplete integration between planning and execution tools.

**Investigation query**

```sql
-- Shipments that proceeded despite a negative confirmation flag
SELECT confirm.case_id,
       confirm.timestamp AS confirm_time,
       confirm.additional_info,
       ship.timestamp AS ship_time,
       ship.additional_info AS ship_info
FROM order_event_log confirm
JOIN order_event_log ship
  ON confirm.case_id = ship.case_id
WHERE confirm.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND confirm.additional_info ILIKE '%shipment_scheduled=N%'
  AND ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND ship.timestamp >= confirm.timestamp
ORDER BY confirm.timestamp;
```

---

## 5. Role compliance and segregation of duties

**Observed anomaly**

- Need to confirm whether only authorized roles are executing each activity (e.g., Finance staff doing credit checks? Warehouse staff confirming shipments?).

**Possible reasons**

- Resource substitutions during staff shortages.
- Role misconfiguration in user management systems.

**Investigation query**

```sql
-- Activities being performed by unexpected roles
SELECT oel.case_id,
       oel.activity,
       oel.resource,
       r.role,
       r.department,
       oel.timestamp
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r
  ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE (oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department <> 'Finance')
   OR (oel.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND r.department <> 'Logistics')
   OR (oel.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND r.department <> 'Logistics')
ORDER BY oel.timestamp;
```

## 6. Detect additional irregular sequences

**General-purpose query**

```sql
-- Measure activity order deviations by comparing actual sequence to the expected order index
WITH ranked_events AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         event_id,
         activity,
         timestamp,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
  FROM order_event_log
),
expected_order AS (
  SELECT 'Register Order'        AS activity, 1 AS expected_pos UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Perform Credit Check', 2 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Validate Stock',       3 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Confirm Shipment',     4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Ship Goods',           5 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Issue Invoice',        6 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Receive Payment',      7
)
SELECT r.case_id,
       r.activity,
       r.seq_num,
       e.expected_pos,
       (r.seq_num - e.expected_pos) AS deviation
FROM ranked_events r
JOIN expected_order e
  ON r.activity = e.activity
WHERE r.seq_num <> e.expected_pos
ORDER BY r.case_id, r.seq_num;
```

This highlights all cases where the actual position deviates from the canonical process.

### Next Steps

1. **Run the queries** to confirm whether these anomalies appear frequently or are isolated incidents.
2. **Review internal policies** to see if any of the “anomalies” are actually alternative approved workflows (e.g., prepayment process, fast-track shipping).
3. **Check system integrations** for logging misorders, especially where timestamps show improbable sequences.
4. **Educate or retrain staff** if non-compliance is due to human error, and/or update automated checks to block premature steps.
