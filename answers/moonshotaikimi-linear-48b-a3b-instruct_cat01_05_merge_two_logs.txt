Below is a concise, documented merge of the two logs.

-------------------------------------------------
Merging Strategy
-------------------------------------------------
1. **Primary timeline** – System A’s timestamps are kept; System B’s timestamps are used only when A has no matching event.  
2. **Tolerance window** – ±2 s.  
3. **Match keys** – (order_id, best-effort event name alignment).  
4. **Resolution rules**  
   - If a System A event has a System B counterpart within ±2 s, merge them; attributes from both logs are carried.  
   - If a System B event lies outside ±2 s of every System A event, keep it but label it “extra” to avoid accidental timeline shifts.  
   - If a System A event lacks a System B counterpart, leave it as-is.

-------------------------------------------------
Reasoning Highlights
-------------------------------------------------
- Order Received: Two candidates in B (09:59:58 and 10:00:00). The 09:59:58 record is within ±2 s and enriched; the 10:00:00 A-only record is kept as-is.  
- Order Validated, Item Shipped, Item Delivered: No matching B events  retained from A only.  
- Payment Processed / PaymentCheck: 10:02:00 vs 10:02:05  merged; textual notes appended.  
- Shipping / Quality Check: No A events  kept from B only but marked “extra”.
