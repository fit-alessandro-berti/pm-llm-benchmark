**Cases with Longer Resolution Times:**

- Case 102: This case took significantly longer to resolve compared to others. The ticket was escalated to a Level-2 agent, which added extra time to the resolution process.

**Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues:**

1. **Escalations**: Cases that required escalations to higher-level agents took longer to resolve. This indicates a gap in the expertise or training of Level-1 agents, leading to a need for escalations.

2. **Long Waiting Times**: In Case 104, there was a long waiting period between assigning the ticket to the Level-1 agent and starting the investigation, which delayed the resolution process.

3. **Unnecessary Delays**: In Case 105, the ticket was escalated to a Level-2 agent before the investigation was completed. This could indicate a lack of clear escalation criteria or premature escalations, causing delays.

**Insights and Recommendations:**

1. **Enhanced Training**: Providing additional training to Level-1 agents can help improve their efficiency and effectiveness in resolving tickets without the need for constant escalations.

2. **Streamlined Processes**: Reviewing and optimizing the escalation criteria can help reduce unnecessary escalations and ensure that Level-1 agents have the necessary resources to resolve tickets independently.

3. **Improved Communication**: Implementing a system for better communication between agents can help reduce waiting times between ticket handoffs and ensure a seamless transition between different stages of the resolution process.

4. **Performance Metrics**: Monitoring key performance metrics such as resolution times, escalation rates, and waiting times can help identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in the support ticket resolution process. Regular analysis and feedback can aid in continuously optimizing the process for better efficiency.
