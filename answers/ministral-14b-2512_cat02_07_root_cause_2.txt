### **1. Identifying Cases with Significantly Longer Durations**
First, let's calculate the total duration for each case by subtracting the **Submit Claim** timestamp from the **Close Claim** timestamp.

| **Case ID** | **Submit Claim Timestamp** | **Close Claim Timestamp** | **Total Duration (Days:HH:MM)** |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 2001        | 2024-04-01 09:00          | 2024-04-01 10:30          | **00:01:30** (Fast)             |
| 2002        | 2024-04-01 09:05          | 2024-04-02 11:00          | **01:01:55** (Moderate)          |
| 2003        | 2024-04-01 09:10          | 2024-04-03 09:30          | **01:20:20** (Slow)             |
| 2004        | 2024-04-01 09:20          | 2024-04-01 10:45          | **00:01:25** (Fast)             |
| 2005        | 2024-04-01 09:25          | 2024-04-04 14:30          | **02:05:05** (Very Slow)        |

**Observations:**
- **Case 2005** takes **~2.5 days**, which is **significantly longer** than the others.
- **Case 2003** also takes **~1.3 days**, which is **slower than average** but not as extreme as 2005.
- **Cases 2001 & 2004** complete in **under 2 hours**, while **Case 2002** takes **~1 day**.

**Conclusion:**
- **Primary performance issue:** **Case 2005** (High complexity, Region B, handled by Adjuster_Lisa).
- **Secondary issue:** **Case 2003** (High complexity, Region A, handled by Adjuster_Mike).

### **2. Analyzing Root Causes**
Now, let’s examine how **Resource, Region, and Complexity** correlate with longer durations.

#### **A. Complexity Impact**
| **Complexity** | **Avg. Duration** | **Key Observations** |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Low**        | ~1 hour           | Fastest processing (Cases 2001, 2004) |
| **Medium**     | ~1 day            | Moderate delay (Case 2002) |
| **High**       | ~1.5–2.5 days     | **Major bottleneck** (Cases 2003, 2005) |

**Findings:**
- **High-complexity claims take significantly longer** due to:
  - **Multiple "Request Additional Documents" events** (2–3 times in Cases 2003 & 2005).
  - **Longer evaluation and approval times** (e.g., Case 2005 took **3 days** just for approval).
  - **Possible delays in document submission** (if customers take time to provide requested info).

#### **B. Region Impact**
| **Region** | **Avg. Duration** | **Key Observations** |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **A**      | ~1.3 days         | Slower for high-complexity (Case 2003) |
| **B**      | ~1.5 days         | **Worse for high-complexity (Case 2005)** |

**Findings:**
- **Region B has worse performance for high-complexity claims** (Case 2005 took **2.5 days** vs. Case 2003’s **1.3 days** in Region A).
- **Possible reasons:**
  - **Resource bottlenecks** (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa in Region B may be overloaded).
  - **Regional workflow inefficiencies** (e.g., slower document retrieval, approval delays).
  - **Customer response times** (if Region B customers take longer to submit documents).

#### **C. Resource Impact**
| **Resource**       | **Avg. Duration** | **Key Observations** |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Adjuster_Mike**  | ~1.3 days         | Handles **Case 2003 (High, Region A)** |
| **Adjuster_Lisa**  | **~2 days**       | Handles **Case 2005 (High, Region B)** |
| **Manager_Ann**    | ~1 day            | Handles **Cases 2002, 2004 (Medium/Low)** |
| **Manager_Bill**   | ~1.5–2.5 days     | Handles **Cases 2003, 2005 (High)** |

**Findings:**
- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) has the worst performance** for high-complexity claims.
  - **Possible reasons:**
    - **Overworked** (handling multiple document requests in Case 2005).
    - **Less experienced** in high-complexity cases.
    - **Slower approval chain** (Manager_Bill took **3 days** to approve Case 2005).
- **Manager_Bill is a bottleneck** for high-complexity cases (takes **~2 days** to approve vs. Manager_Ann’s **~1 day**).

### **3. Root Cause Analysis & Mitigation Strategies**
#### **Primary Root Causes:**
1. **High Complexity  Multiple Document Requests  Delays**
   - **Evidence:** Cases 2003 & 2005 had **2–3 "Request Additional Documents"** events, extending processing.
   - **Why?**
     - Complex claims require **more back-and-forth** with customers.
     - Some adjusters may **not be trained** to minimize document requests.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - **Preemptive document checklists** (reduce unnecessary requests).
     - **Training adjusters** to identify missing docs upfront.
     - **Automated reminders** for customers to submit documents faster.

2. **Region B Underperformance for High-Complexity Claims**
   - **Evidence:** Case 2005 (Region B) took **2.5 days** vs. Case 2003 (Region A) at **1.3 days**.
   - **Why?**
     - **Resource constraints** (Adjuster_Lisa may be overloaded).
     - **Regional workflow inefficiencies** (e.g., slower approvals, document retrieval).
   - **Mitigation:**
     - **Reallocate resources** (e.g., assign a backup adjuster for Region B).
     - **Audit Region B’s approval process** (why does Manager_Bill take longer?).
     - **Implement regional KPIs** to track and improve performance.

3. **Specific Resource Bottlenecks (Adjuster_Lisa & Manager_Bill)**
   - **Evidence:** Adjuster_Lisa handled **Case 2005 with 3 document requests**, and Manager_Bill took **3 days to approve**.
   - **Why?**
     - **Single-point failure** (one adjuster handling too many high-complexity cases).
     - **Approval delays** (Manager_Bill may be reviewing too many cases).
   - **Mitigation:**
     - **Load balancing** (distribute high-complexity cases across adjusters).
     - **Fast-track approvals** for straightforward high-complexity cases.
     - **Hire/train additional adjusters** in Region B.

### **4. Proposed Improvements**
| **Issue** | **Solution** | **Expected Impact** |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **High-complexity delays** | Preemptive document checklists + adjuster training | Reduce document requests by **30-50%** |
| **Region B underperformance** | Resource reallocation + workflow audit | Cut Case 2005-like delays by **50%** |
| **Adjuster_Lisa bottleneck** | Distribute high-complexity cases | Reduce her workload by **40%** |
| **Manager_Bill approval delays** | Fast-track simple high-complexity cases | Speed up approvals by **2 days** |

---
### **Final Recommendations**
1. **Prioritize high-complexity cases** with **preemptive document requests** to avoid delays.
2. **Monitor Region B’s performance** and **reallocate resources** (e.g., assign a backup adjuster).
3. **Train adjusters** to handle high-complexity claims more efficiently.
4. **Optimize approval workflows** (e.g., Manager_Bill could delegate simpler cases).
5. **Implement automated alerts** for slow-moving cases to prevent bottlenecks.

By addressing these **root causes (Complexity  Document Requests  Region/Resource Bottlenecks)**, the insurance claims process can **reduce lead times by 30-50%** for high-complexity cases.
