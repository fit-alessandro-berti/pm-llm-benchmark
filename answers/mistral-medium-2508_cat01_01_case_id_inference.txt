To infer the case groupings (i.e., distinct patient journeys) from the interleaved sequence, we can use the following attributes as clues:
1. **Patient demographics** (`patient_age`, `patient_gender`): Events with the same age and gender likely belong to the same case.
2. **Department and activity sequence**: The logical flow of activities (e.g., registration  triage  consultation  discharge) within a department suggests a single case.
3. **Resource continuity**: The same doctor/nurse handling multiple events for the same patient.
4. **Timing**: Events for the same case are typically close in time (though not always strictly sequential due to interleaving).

### Step-by-Step Grouping:
1. **Case 1 (ER, Male, 45)**:
   - Event 1: Register patient (ER, 45M)
   - Event 4: Initial triage (ER, 45M)
   - Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology, 45M)
   - Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, 45M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
   - Event 15: Patient discharged (ER, 45M)

   *Rationale*: All events share `patient_age=45`, `patient_gender=M`, and follow a logical ER workflow (registration  triage  imaging  consultation  discharge).

2. **Case 2 (ER, Female, 62)**:
   - Event 2: Register patient (ER, 62F)
   - Event 5: Initial triage (ER, 62F)
   - Event 8: Lab test requested (ER, 62F)
   - Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory, 62F)
   - Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, 62F, diagnosis=minor_infection)
   - Event 14: Prescription created (ER, 62F)
   - Event 17: Patient discharged (ER, 62F)

   *Rationale*: All events share `patient_age=62`, `patient_gender=F`, and follow an ER workflow with lab tests and prescription.

3. **Case 3 (Surgery, Male, 28)**:
   - Event 3: Register patient (Surgery, 28M)
   - Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery, 28M, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
   - Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery, 28M)
   - Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery, 28M)
   - Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery, 28M)
   - Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, 28M)

   *Rationale*: All events share `patient_age=28`, `patient_gender=M`, and follow a surgical workflow (registration  consultation  prep  surgery  recovery  discharge).

### Verification:
- No overlaps in patient demographics (age/gender) between cases.
- Each case's events form a coherent, department-specific workflow.
- Timestamps are consistent with interleaving (e.g., Case 1's X-ray at 08:15:42 occurs while Case 2 is undergoing lab tests).

### Final Case Groupings:
| Case ID | Events (Line Numbers) | Patient Demographics | Department | Key Activities                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Case 1   | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15        | 45M                  | ER         | Register  Triage  X-ray  Consultation  Discharge                          |
| Case 2   | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17| 62F                  | ER         | Register  Triage  Lab test  Consultation  Prescription  Discharge         |
| Case 3   | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18    | 28M                  | Surgery    | Register  Consultation  Surgery prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge       |

### Notes:
- The `additional_info` (e.g., `insurance`, `triage_code`, `diagnosis`) further supports the groupings (e.g., Case 1's `hairline_fracture` aligns with X-ray imaging).
- No events are left ungrouped, and no events are shared across cases. The interleaving is resolved cleanly.
