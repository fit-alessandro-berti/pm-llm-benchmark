### Identification of Cases with Longer Resolution Times

To identify cases with significantly longer total resolution times, we need to calculate the total duration from the receipt of the ticket to its closure for each case.

1. **Case 101:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:00
   - Closed: 2024-03-01 10:15
   - Total Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes

2. **Case 102:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:05
   - Closed: 2024-03-02 09:15
   - Total Duration: 25 hours 10 minutes

3. **Case 103:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:10
   - Closed: 2024-03-01 09:30
   - Total Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes

4. **Case 104:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:20
   - Closed: 2024-03-02 08:30
   - Total Duration: 24 hours 10 minutes

5. **Case 105:**
   - Received: 2024-03-01 08:25
   - Closed: 2024-03-03 09:30
   - Total Duration: 49 hours 5 minutes

**Cases with significantly longer resolution times:**
- Case 102: 25 hours 10 minutes
- Case 104: 24 hours 10 minutes
- Case 105: 49 hours 5 minutes

### Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

1. **Escalations:**
   - **Case 102:** Escalated to Level-2 Agent after 3.5 hours (from 09:00 to 14:00).
   - **Case 104:** No escalation.
   - **Case 105:** Escalated to Level-2 Agent after 1 hour (from 09:10 to 14:00) and again a significant delay before resolution.

2. **Long Waiting Times Between Activities:**
   - **Case 102:** Took 17 hours between Investigate Issue (14:00 on 2024-03-01) and Resolve Ticket (09:00 on 2024-03-02).
   - **Case 104:** Took 16 hours between Assign to Level-1 Agent (09:30 on 2024-03-01) and Investigate Issue (13:00 on 2024-03-01), and another 17 hours from Investigate Issue (13:00 on 2024-03-01) to Resolve Ticket (08:00 on 2024-03-02).
   - **Case 105:** Took 22 hours between Investigate Issue (10:00 on 2024-03-01) and Escalate to Level-2 Agent (14:00 on 2024-03-02), and another 21 hours from Escalate to Level-2 Agent (14:00 on 2024-03-02) to Resolve Ticket (09:00 on 2024-03-03).

3. **Unnecessary Delays Before Investigation and Resolution Steps:**
   - **Case 102:** Delay between Triage and Assign to Level-1 Agent (0.5 hours), and a significant delay between Investigate Issue and Resolve Ticket (17 hours).
   - **Case 104:** Delay between Triage and Assign to Level-1 Agent (1 hour), and delays between Assign to Level-1 Agent to Investigate Issue (16 hours) and Investigate Issue to Resolve Ticket (17 hours).
   - **Case 105:** Delay between Triage and Assign to Level-1 Agent (0.5 hours), and significant delays between Assign to Level-1 Agent to Investigate Issue (1 hour), Investigate Issue to Escalate to Level-2 Agent (22 hours), and Escalate to Level-2 Agent to Resolve Ticket (21 hours).

### Insights and Recommendations

1. **Escalation Process:**
   - **Issue:** Escalations significantly prolong the resolution time.
   - **Recommendation:** Optimize the escalation process by improving the initial triage and assignment. Ensure that Level-1 agents are well-equipped to handle most issues or quickly escalate to Level-2 agents without prolonged wait times.

2. **Reduce Waiting Times:**
   - **Issue:** Long waiting times between activities, especially between assigning tickets and investigation and then from investigation to resolution.
   - **Recommendation:** Implement a ticketing system that provides real-time updates and alerts. Ensure that support agents have clear workflows and deadlines for each step in the process.

3. **Improve Initial Triage and Assignment:**
   - **Issue:** Delays at the triage and assignment stages.
   - **Recommendation:** Enhance the triage system to better categorize and prioritize tickets. Implement automated assignment tools that can quickly match tickets to the most suitable agents based on expertise and availability.

4. **Training and Resource Allocation:**
   - **Issue:** Level-1 agents may not have the necessary skills to handle complex issues, leading to escalations and delays.
   - **Recommendation:** Provide regular training for Level-1 agents to handle a wider range of issues. Ensure that there are adequate resources and specialists available to handle escalated tickets promptly.

By addressing these factors, the overall resolution time for support tickets can be significantly reduced, leading to improved customer satisfaction and more efficient use of support resources.
