The DECLARE model representing the prescribed constraints for the complex product design and launch process is constructed below. Support for all rules is set to 1.0, and confidence reflects the mandatory or strongly typical nature of the business rules.

```python
DECLARE = {
    # --- Unary Constraints (Activity -> Support/Confidence) ---

    'existence': {
        # The process must start (IG) and must finish (FL).
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'FL': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },

    'absence': {
        # Assuming no activity is strictly prohibited from occurring.
    },

    'exactly_one': {
        # IG should ideally happen only once per trace.
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.95},
        # FL should happen exactly once.
        'FL': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.98},
    },

    'init': {
        # The Idea Generation must be the first activity in the process.
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },

    # --- Binary/N-ary Constraints (Tuple(A, B) -> Support/Confidence) ---

    'responded_existence': {
        # If any later activity happens, its required predecessor must also exist.
        ('DD', 'IG'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.99},  # If DD occurred, IG must have existed.

        # Technical Feasibility Check and Cost Evaluation are both necessary early checks.
        ('TFC', 'CE'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.95},

        ('AG', 'MP'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.99},
        ('MP', 'FL'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, # Marketing Plan must lead to Final Launch.
    },

    'precedence': {
        # B cannot occur unless A has occurred previously.
        ('PC', 'TFC'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.99}, # Prototype Creation must be preceded by TFC.
        ('PC', 'CE'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.99}, # Prototype Creation must be preceded by CE.

    },

    'succession': {
        # A response and A precedence combined (A must be followed by B, and B must be preceded by A)
        ('AG', 'FL'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.90}, # Approval Gate succeeded by Final Launch (eventually).
    },
