Here’s an estimated temporal profile for the global supply chain process in manufacturing high-tech electronics. The values for average time and standard deviation are hypothetical but based on reasonable assumptions about supply chain dynamics, including supplier lead times, inspection times, assembly durations, and shipping logistics.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 14400),  # Supplier selection to order placement (~2 days, ±4 hours)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),  # Supplier selection to receiving components (~1 week, ±1 day)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400),  # Order placement to receiving components (~5 days, ±1 day)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),  # Receiving components to quality inspection (~1 day, ±6 hours)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 10800),  # Quality inspection to component assembly (~12 hours, ±3 hours)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),  # Component assembly to product testing (~1 day, ±12 hours)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 14400),  # Product testing to packaging (~12 hours, ±4 hours)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 7200),  # Packaging to warehouse storage (~6 hours, ±2 hours)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),  # Packaging to distribution (~2 days, ±12 hours)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 21600),  # Warehouse storage to distribution (~1 day, ±6 hours)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 432000),  # Distribution to after-sales support (~30 days, ±5 days)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (691200, 129600),  # Supplier selection to quality inspection (~8 days, ±1.5 days)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (518400, 86400),  # Order placement to component assembly (~6 days, ±1 day)
    ('OP', 'DT'): (1209600, 172800),  # Order placement to distribution (~14 days, ±2 days)
    ('RC', 'PK'): (259200, 43200),  # Receiving components to packaging (~3 days, ±12 hours)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (777600, 129600),  # Quality inspection to distribution (~9 days, ±1.5 days)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (172800, 43200),  # Component assembly to warehouse storage (~2 days, ±12 hours)
}

```

### Explanation:
- **Supplier selection to order placement (SS → OP)** takes about **2 days**, as choosing the right supplier can be quick, but sometimes negotiations take longer.
- **Order placement to receiving components (OP → RC)** takes **5 days** on average due to supplier lead times.
- **Receiving components to quality inspection (RC → QI)** happens **within a day**, as inspections are typically performed immediately after arrival.
- **Component assembly to product testing (CA → PT)** takes **1 day**, since testing includes various procedures.
- **Packaging to warehouse storage (PK → WS)** is a quick **6-hour** process.
- **Distribution to after-sales support (DT → AS)** spans **30 days** on average, accounting for product delivery, customer usage, and potential issues.

These estimates reflect a mix of short, medium, and long delays, simulating realistic variances in supply chain execution.
