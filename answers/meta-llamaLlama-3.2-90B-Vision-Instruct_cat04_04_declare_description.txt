The process underlying this data appears to be a workflow for handling employee declarations and payments. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Initialization**: The process starts with an employee submitting their declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

2. **Declaration Approval**: The declaration is then approved by a supervisor (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`). This step must occur exactly once.

3. **Request Payment**: After the declaration is approved, a payment is requested (`Request Payment`). This step must occur exactly once.

4. **Payment Handling**: The payment is then handled (`Payment Handled`). This step must occur exactly once.

5. **Alternate Response**: The process has alternate responses between `Request Payment` and `Payment Handled`, indicating that these steps must alternate without repetition.

6. **Chain Precedence**: There is a chain precedence between `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` and `Request Payment`, and between `Request Payment` and `Payment Handled`, indicating that these steps must occur in a specific order.

7. **Response and Succession**: The process has responses and succession constraints between various steps, indicating that certain steps must occur in response to others.

8. **Absence**: Certain steps are absent from the process, including declaration rejection, saving, and approval by various parties.

Here's a simplified process diagram:
```
