We are given a database schema and example data for an order process. The goal is to identify anomalies in the event log and then propose SQL queries to investigate them.

First, let's recall the assumed normal process flow:
1. Register Order (Sales)
2. Perform Credit Check (Finance)
3. Validate Stock (Warehouse)
4. Confirm Shipment (Logistics)
5. Ship Goods (Logistics)
6. Issue Invoice (Finance)
7. Receive Payment (Finance)

We'll look for deviations from this flow in the example data.

Let's analyze each case:

Case 1001:
- Events: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment.
This is the normal flow.

Case 1002:
- Events: Register Order, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment.
Anomalies:
1. Confirm Shipment (event 9) occurs before Perform Credit Check (event 11) and Validate Stock (event 12).
This is a problem because Credit Check and Stock Validation should happen before shipment.
2. Also, Validate Stock (event 12) occurs after Ship Goods (event 10). This is backward.

Case 1003:
- Events: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Receive Payment.
Anomalies:
1. Ship Goods (event 17) occurs before Validate Stock (which is missing) and before Confirm Shipment (event 19).
But note: Validate Stock is not present? Actually, in the log we have:
Register Order (15), Perform Credit Check (16), Ship Goods (17), Issue Invoice (18), Confirm Shipment (19), Receive Payment (20).
So Validate Stock (which should be step 3) is missing. Also, Confirm Shipment (step 4) is after Ship Goods (step 5) and Issue Invoice (step 6).
This is a major deviation: Ship Goods should be after Confirm Shipment, and Validate Stock should be before Confirm Shipment.

Case 1004:
- Events: Register Order, Receive Payment, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods.
Anomalies:
1. Receive Payment (event 22) occurs before Issue Invoice (event 23) and before Confirm Shipment (event 24).
This is impossible because you cannot receive payment before issuing an invoice.
2. Also, the normal flow requires Credit Check and Validate Stock, but they are missing.

So the anomalies we have found are:

1. Case 1002:
- Confirm Shipment before Credit Check and Validate Stock.
- Ship Goods before Validate Stock.

2. Case 1003:
- Missing Validate Stock (step 3) entirely.
- Ship Goods (step 5) before Confirm Shipment (step 4) and Issue Invoice (step 6).

3. Case 1004:
- Receive Payment (step 7) before Issue Invoice (step 6).

Additionally, we note that in Case 1003, the event "Confirm Shipment" (event 19) has an additional_info "late_confirmation=Y", which might be a consequence of the missing steps.

Hypotheses for these anomalies:

Case 1002:
- The system might have a bug that allows the shipment to be confirmed before credit check and stock validation.
- Alternatively, the process might have been manually overridden (e.g., by a manager) to expedite the shipment, but that would be a policy violation.

Case 1003:
- The Validate Stock step might have been skipped due to a system error or a process error (e.g., the warehouse clerk didn't log the event).
- The system might have a bug that allowed the shipment to be processed without stock validation.

Case 1004:
- The finance team might have mistakenly recorded the payment before the invoice was issued (a data entry error).
- The system might have a bug that allowed payment to be recorded without an invoice.

Now, we need to propose SQL queries to investigate these anomalies.

We can break down the investigation into:

1. Find all cases where the event sequence deviates from the normal flow (i.e., an event that should come after another appears before it).

We can do this by ordering the events by timestamp per case_id and then checking the sequence of activities.

However, note that the normal flow is fixed. We can create a mapping of the expected order of activities.

Let's define the expected order:

Step 1: 'Register Order'
Step 2: 'Perform Credit Check'
Step 3: 'Validate Stock'
Step 4: 'Confirm Shipment'
Step 5: 'Ship Goods'
Step 6: 'Issue Invoice'
Step 7: 'Receive Payment'

We can create a sequence for each activity and then for each case, check if the sequence of activities (by timestamp) matches the expected sequence.

But note: the events are logged in chronological order (by timestamp) so we can sort by timestamp.

We can write a query that for each case_id, orders the events by timestamp and then checks if the activity sequence matches the expected sequence.

However, the problem is that the expected sequence is fixed. We can use a common table expression (CTE) to assign a sequence number for the expected order, and then for each event in the log, we can get the expected sequence number. Then we can check if the actual sequence (by timestamp) matches the expected.

But note: the log might have extra events or missing events. We are only concerned with the order of the required events.

Alternatively, we can check for specific violations:

- For example, we can check if 'Confirm Shipment' occurs before 'Perform Credit Check' or 'Validate Stock'.

Similarly, we can check for:
- 'Ship Goods' before 'Confirm Shipment' or 'Validate Stock'
- 'Issue Invoice' before 'Ship Goods' or before 'Confirm Shipment' (but note: in the normal flow, Issue Invoice can be after Ship Goods, but in the anomaly of case 1004, we have Receive Payment before Issue Invoice, which is the main issue for that case)

But note: the problem states that the target LLM should propose SQL queries to investigate the anomalies.

So, let's propose queries for the specific anomalies we found.

Query 1: Find cases where Confirm Shipment occurs before Perform Credit Check.

We can do:

SELECT
ol1.case_id
FROM
order_event_log ol1
JOIN
order_event_log ol2 ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND ol2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
AND ol1.timestamp > ol2.timestamp; -- This would be the normal case (Confirm Shipment after Credit Check). We want the opposite.

But we want cases where Confirm Shipment happens before Credit Check, so:

SELECT
ol1.case_id
FROM
order_event_log ol1
JOIN
order_event_log ol2 ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND ol2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;

Similarly, we can check for Confirm Shipment before Validate Stock.

Query 2: Find cases where Confirm Shipment occurs before Validate Stock.

SELECT
ol1.case_id
FROM
order_event_log ol1
JOIN
order_event_log ol2 ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND ol2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;

Query 3: Find cases where Ship Goods occurs before Validate Stock.

SELECT
ol1.case_id
FROM
order_event_log ol1
JOIN
order_event_log ol2 ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND ol2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;

Query 4: Find cases where Ship Goods occurs before Confirm Shipment.

SELECT
ol1.case_id
FROM
order_event_log ol1
JOIN
order_event_log ol2 ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND ol2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;

Query 5: Find cases where Receive Payment occurs before Issue Invoice.

SELECT
ol1.case_id
FROM
order_event_log ol1
JOIN
order_event_log ol2 ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
AND ol2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;

Additionally, we might want to find cases that are missing a required step. However, the problem doesn't specify how to detect missing steps, but we can do:

Query 6: Find cases that are missing any of the required activities.

But note: the problem says to investigate the anomalies we identified. We have already identified specific anomalies (sequence issues). However, for completeness, we can also check for missing steps.

But the prompt says: "Propose relevant SQL queries on the `order_event_log` table (and possibly `orders` and `resources` tables) to investigate these hypotheses further"

We'll stick to the sequence issues we found.

However, note: in Case 1003, we have a missing Validate Stock. We can also check for missing steps by:

SELECT
case_id
FROM
order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(*) < 7; -- But note: not every case must have exactly 7 events? Some might have more (if there are retries) or less (if missing steps). But the normal flow is 7 steps.

But the problem says the assumed normal flow is 7 steps. However, the example data shows 7 events for the normal case (1001) but 7 events for others too. So we can assume that a complete process has 7 events. But note: the anomaly cases also have 7 events (Case 1002, 1003, 1004 each have 7 events). So missing steps would be if the count is less than 7? But Case 1003 has 6 events? Wait, let me count:

Case 1003: 6 events (15 to 20). So it's missing one step (Validate Stock). So we can check for cases with less than 7 events? But note: the normal flow has 7 steps, but the log might have duplicate events or extra events? We don't have a fixed count.

Alternatively, we can check for the absence of a specific activity.

For example, to find cases missing 'Validate Stock':

SELECT
case_id
FROM
order_event_log
WHERE
case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock')
GROUP BY case_id;

But note: the problem says "without any hints", so we are to propose queries that would help investigate the anomalies we identified.

Since we have identified specific sequence issues, we'll propose the sequence queries.

Let's write the queries as proposed:

1. Query for cases where Confirm Shipment occurs before Perform Credit Check:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ol1.case_id
FROM order_event_log ol1
JOIN order_event_log ol2
ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND ol2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;
```

2. Query for cases where Confirm Shipment occurs before Validate Stock:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ol1.case_id
FROM order_event_log ol1
JOIN order_event_log ol2
ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND ol2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;
```

3. Query for cases where Ship Goods occurs before Validate Stock:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ol1.case_id
FROM order_event_log ol1
JOIN order_event_log ol2
ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND ol2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;
```

4. Query for cases where Ship Goods occurs before Confirm Shipment:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ol1.case_id
FROM order_event_log ol1
JOIN order_event_log ol2
ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
AND ol2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;
```

5. Query for cases where Receive Payment occurs before Issue Invoice:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ol1.case_id
FROM order_event_log ol1
JOIN order_event_log ol2
ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE
ol1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
AND ol2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;
```

We can also combine these into one query that returns all the cases and the specific violation, but the problem doesn't require that. We are to propose relevant queries.

Note: We are using `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate case_ids.

Additionally, we might want to see the actual events to verify, but the problem says "investigate further", so these queries will return the case_ids that have the anomaly, and then we can look at the full log for that case.

We'll present these five queries.

But note: the problem says "without any hints or guidance", so we are just listing the queries.

Let's write them as the answer.
</think>

Based on the provided schema and example data, I've identified critical anomalies in the order process flow. Below are the anomalies, hypotheses for their causes, and the relevant SQL queries to investigate them without any additional guidance.

---

### **Anomalies Identified & Hypotheses**
1. **Case 1002: `Confirm Shipment` before `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`**  
   - *Hypothesis*: System error or manual override to expedite shipment (violating credit/stock checks).  
   - *Why?* Credit check (Finance) and stock validation (Warehouse) are prerequisites for shipment.  

2. **Case 1003: `Ship Goods` before `Validate Stock` and `Confirm Shipment`**  
   - *Hypothesis*: Warehouse system failure or missing process step (e.g., stock validation skipped due to training error).  
   - *Why?* Stock validation must occur before shipment confirmation.  

3. **Case 1004: `Receive Payment` before `Issue Invoice`**  
   - *Hypothesis*: Data entry error (Finance team mistakenly logged payment before invoice).  
   - *Why?* Payment cannot be received before an invoice is issued.  

---

### **SQL Queries to Investigate Anomalies**

#### **1. Find cases where `Confirm Shipment` occurs before `Perform Credit Check`**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol1.case_id
FROM 
    order_event_log ol1
JOIN 
    order_event_log ol2 
    ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE 
    ol1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND ol2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
    AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;
```
*Purpose*: Isolate cases where shipment confirmation happened *before* credit checks (violating step 2 → step 4 dependency).

---

#### **2. Find cases where `Ship Goods` occurs before `Validate Stock`**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol1.case_id
FROM 
    order_event_log ol1
JOIN 
    order_event_log ol2 
    ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE 
    ol1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    AND ol2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
    AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;
```
*Purpose*: Identify cases where goods were shipped *before* stock validation (step 3 → step 5 dependency violation).

---

#### **3. Find cases where `Receive Payment` occurs before `Issue Invoice`**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol1.case_id
FROM 
    order_event_log ol1
JOIN 
    order_event_log ol2 
    ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE 
    ol1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
    AND ol2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
    AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp;
```
*Purpose*: Detect payment records logged *before* invoices were generated (step 6 → step 7 dependency violation).

---

#### **4. Cross-verify anomalies with `resources` table (to check for role/department patterns)**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol.case_id,
    ol.activity,
    r.role,
    r.department
FROM 
    order_event_log ol
JOIN 
    resources r 
    ON ol.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE 
    ol.case_id IN (
        SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log 
        WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment' 
        AND case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND timestamp > (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = order_event_log.case_id AND activity = 'Confirm Shipment'))
    )
    OR ol.case_id IN (
        SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log 
        WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods' 
        AND case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock' AND timestamp > (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = order_event_log.case_id AND activity = 'Ship Goods'))
    )
    OR ol.case_id IN (
        SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log 
        WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment' 
        AND case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND timestamp > (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = order_event_log.case_id AND activity = 'Receive Payment'))
    );
```
*Purpose*: Link anomalies to resource roles/departments (e.g., did Logistics Manager override Finance checks?).

---

#### **5. Check for missing `Validate Stock` steps (for Case 1003-like anomalies)**
```sql
SELECT 
    case_id
FROM 
    order_event_log
WHERE 
    case_id NOT IN (
        SELECT case_id 
        FROM order_event_log 
        WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock'
    )
    AND activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods');
```
*Purpose*: Identify all cases missing `Validate Stock` (step 3) but having downstream steps (e.g., shipment).

---

### **Why These Queries?**
- **Targeted dependencies**: Each query checks a specific step-order violation (e.g., `Confirm Shipment` before `Credit Check`).  
- **No assumptions**: Queries use only timestamp comparisons (no hardcoded case IDs).  
- **Scalable**: Will return *all* anomalous cases in the full dataset, not just the examples.  
- **Root-cause focused**: The `resources` join query helps determine if anomalies are role-specific (e.g., Logistics overriding Finance).  

These queries directly address the anomalies without external context, enabling the LLM to investigate systematically.
