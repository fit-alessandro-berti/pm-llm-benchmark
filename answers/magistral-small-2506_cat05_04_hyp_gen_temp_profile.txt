### Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive to Approve (R  P)**
   - **Average Time:** ~25 hours (90000 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (3600 seconds)
   - **Issue:** The low standard deviation suggests a highly consistent but suspiciously short time between claim submission and approval, which may indicate artificial or automated acceleration not aligned with business logic.

2. **Approve to Notify (P  N)**
   - **Average Time:** 7 days (604800 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days (172800 seconds)
   - **Issue:** The long average and high variability imply irregular delays in notifications after approval, possibly due to backlogs or resource constraints.

3. **Assign to Close (A  C)**
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours (7200 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (3600 seconds)
   - **Issue:** Claims are closed rapidly after assignment, suggesting some claims may be prematurely closed without completing intermediate steps (e.g., Evaluation, Approval).

4. **Evaluate to Notify (E  N)**
   - **Average Time:** 5 minutes (300 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute (60 seconds)
   - **Issue:** The near-instantaneous transition raises concerns about skipped or automated approvals without proper review.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R  P (Receive to Approve)**
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Automated approval for low-risk claims without manual review.
     - A batch-processing system accelerating approvals at fixed intervals.

2. **P  N (Approve to Notify)**
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - A backlog in customer communication due to limited staff or external delays.
     - Notifications being batched and sent periodically rather than immediately.

3. **A  C (Assign to Close)**
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Some claims are closed without evaluation/approval (e.g., fraudulent claims).
     - Adjuster errors or misclassification of activities in the system.

4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify)**
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Approval is implicitly granted upon evaluation, bypassing explicit approval steps.
     - A system bug causing automatic notifications after evaluation.

### Verification SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Suspiciously Short Receive-to-Approval Times**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type,
          TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'R' THEN e.timestamp END),
                                MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END)) AS receive_to_approve_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
   GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type
   HAVING receive_to_approve_seconds BETWEEN 0 AND 10800;  -- Less than 3 hours
   ```

2. **Check for Long Delays Between Approval and Notification**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_amount,
          TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN e.timestamp END),
                                MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'N' THEN e.timestamp END)) AS days_between_approve_and_notify
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
   GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_amount
   HAVING days_between_approve_and_notify > 7;  -- Longer than 7 days
   ```

3. **Find Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_amount,
          TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'A' THEN e.timestamp END),
                                MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN e.timestamp END)) AS seconds_between_assign_and_close
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
   GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_amount
   HAVING seconds_between_assign_and_close < 3600;  -- Less than 1 hour
   ```

4. **Check for Missing Intermediate Steps (Evaluate/Approve Before Close)**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_amount
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
   GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_amount
   HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) = 0
      OR COUNT(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) = 0;
   ```

5. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters or Regions**
   ```sql
   SELECT e.resource AS adjuster, COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
          AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND,
                   MIN(CASE WHEN e1.activity = 'R' THEN e1.timestamp END),
                   MIN(CASE WHEN e1.activity = 'P' THEN e1.timestamp END))) AS avg_receive_to_approve_seconds
   FROM claim_events e
   JOIN claim_events e1 ON e.claim_id = e1.claim_id
   WHERE e.activity = 'A' AND e.resource IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY e.resource
   ORDER BY avg_receive_to_approve_seconds;
   ```

These queries help identify patterns and root causes behind the observed anomalies in the temporal profile model.
