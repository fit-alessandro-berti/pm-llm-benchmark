### Proposed High-Level Activities for Manufacturing Process

Based on the event log sequence, the low-level events are grouped into the following high-level activities. Each group represents a distinct phase of the manufacturing process, leveraging temporal proximity, resource continuity, and logical workflow dependencies.

---

#### **1. Material Preparation**  
**Low-Level Events:**  
- Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- Scan barcode  
- Place metal sheet on table  
- Align metal sheet  
- Preheat metal sheet  

**Rationale:**  
These events occur consecutively at the start of the process and focus on preparing the raw material for assembly. They involve:  
- **Resource continuity:** Operator A handles material handling (retrieval, scanning, placement), followed by the Robot Arm and Heating Unit for alignment/preheating.  
- **Logical flow:** All events are prerequisites for assembly. Without preparing the material (e.g., alignment, preheating), welding cannot occur.  
- **Temporal proximity:** Events span 20 seconds (08:00:05–08:00:25), forming a cohesive unit.  

**Activity Name:**  
**Material Preparation**

#### **2. Welding Assembly**  
**Low-Level Events:**  
- Pick up welding tool  
- Weld corner A  
- Weld corner B  

**Rationale:**  
These events constitute the core assembly phase:  
- **Resource consistency:** Operator B performs all welding-related actions (tool pickup and welding).  
- **Logical dependency:** Welding requires the preheated material from the previous step and immediately follows it.  
- **Temporal proximity:** Events span 15 seconds (08:01:00–08:01:20).  

**Activity Name:**  
**Welding Assembly**

#### **3. Weld Quality Inspection**  
**Low-Level Events:**  
- Measure weld integrity  

**Rationale:**  
This standalone event validates the quality of the welded assembly:  
- **Logical flow:** Occurs immediately after welding to ensure structural integrity before proceeding to finishing steps.  
- **Resource specificity:** Quality Sensor #1 is dedicated to inspection, distinct from assembly resources.  
- **Temporal adjacency:** Follows Welding Assembly within 10 seconds.  

**Activity Name:**  
**Weld Quality Inspection**

#### **4. Surface Treatment**  
**Low-Level Events:**  
- Apply protective coating  
- Dry coating  

**Rationale:**  
These events form a continuous finishing phase:  
- **Resource continuity:** Coating Unit #3 applies coating, followed by Heating Unit #2 for drying.  
- **Logical dependency:** Coating requires a validated weld (from Step 3) to ensure adhesion.  
- **Temporal proximity:** Events span 25 seconds (08:01:30–08:01:55).  

**Activity Name:**  
**Surface Treatment**  

---

#### **5. Final Quality Inspection**  
**Low-Level Events:**  
- Visual check  

**Rationale:**  
This is the concluding quality control step:  
- **Logical necessity:** Validates the fully processed product (coated and dried) before release.  
- **Resource specificity:** Operator C performs visual checks, distinct from earlier operators.  
- **Temporal adjacency:** Follows Surface Treatment within 5–15 seconds.  

**Activity Name:**  
**Final Quality Inspection**

### Key Insights for Grouping  
1. **Temporal Closeness:** Groups span 25 seconds, ensuring logical continuity.  
2. **Resource Patterns:**  
   - Operator A: Material handling.  
   - Operator B: Welding.  
   - Operator C: Final inspection.  
   - Machines (Robot Arm, Heating Units, Sensors): Support roles within phases.  
3. **Process Dependencies:**  
   - Welding requires preheated material (Step 1).  
   - Coating requires validated welds (Step 3).  
   - Final inspection requires coated product (Step 4).  
4. **Domain Relevance:**  
   - "Surface Treatment" consolidates coating/drying (common in manufacturing).  
   - Quality checks are split into weld-specific and final inspections for precision.  

This abstraction simplifies analysis of the full log while preserving critical process stages. For the full event log, apply these rules:  
- Group contiguous events with shared resources or workflow dependencies.  
- Use timestamps to identify phase boundaries (e.g., gaps >60 seconds may indicate new phases).
