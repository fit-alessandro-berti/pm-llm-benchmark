Here is a concise process tree that captures:

- The mandatory start with RA (Receive Application)
- The first validation and eligibility assessment (VF, AE)
- An optional loop where missing info can be requested one or more times (RMI) followed by re-validation (VF)
- The final linear sequence: AD  SC  AC

Final process tree structure (using the given operators and notation):

->(
  'RA',
  'VF',
  'AE',
  *(
    +(
      'RMI',
      tau
    ),
    'VF'
  ),
  'AD',
  'SC',
  'AC'
)

Explanation of key parts (informal, matching the log):

- RA  VF  AE: Always executed first, as seen in all cases.
- * ( + ( 'RMI', tau ), 'VF' ):
  - Models a loop:
    - In each iteration, you either:
      - Perform one or more RMI in parallel (capturing the possibility of multiple RMI occurrences), then VF, or
      - Skip RMI (via tau) and just do VF.
  - The loop is optional: it can be taken zero times (tau-exit), or repeated several times.
- AD  SC  AC: Final mandatory sequence for all cases.
