Below are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, as requested. I'll define each step using the POWL syntax, highlighting the differences between the two models, especially concerning the handling of cultural fit and affiliation checks.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for Data Completeness
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR Branch for Cultural Fit/Affiliation Check
CulturalFitAffiliationCheck = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Sequence of the Process
UnfairProcess = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
)
UnfairProcess.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
UnfairProcess.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
UnfairProcess.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitAffiliationCheck)
UnfairProcess.order.add_edge(CulturalFitAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview)
UnfairProcess.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities (Same as above, for brevity, the comments are omitted)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")  # Renamed for clarity
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for Data Completeness (Same as above)
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Removed XOR Branch; All applicants undergo the same StandardCulturalFitCheck
FairProcess = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
)
FairProcess.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
FairProcess.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
FairProcess.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck)
FairProcess.order.add_edge(StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
FairProcess.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Key Differences:**

1. **XOR Branch Removal:** In the "POWL Model Without Unfairness," the XOR branch that led to either a standard cultural fit check or a community affiliation check has been removed. Instead, all applicants now undergo the same `StandardCulturalFitCheck`, ensuring fairness.

2. **Renaming for Clarity:** In the fair model, `CulturalFitCheck` has been renamed to `StandardCulturalFitCheck` to highlight that this process does not differentiate based on community affiliations.

3. **Simplified Process Flow:** By removing the conditional branching based on community affiliations, the fair process flow is more straightforward, reducing the potential for unconscious bias in the hiring process.
