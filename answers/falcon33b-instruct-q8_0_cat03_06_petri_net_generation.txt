```output
Petri Net Constructed:
<class 'pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj.PetriNet'> (20 places, 19 transitions)
Initial Marking: CR=1
Final Marking: P=1, N=1, CL=1
```
The Petri net has been constructed with the following details:

- **Places**: 
  - "CR": Claim Registration
  - "DV": Document Verification
  - "FC": Fraud Check
  - "CA": Claim Assessment
  - "AP": Approval
  - "P": Payment
  - "N": Notification
  - "CL": Closure

- **Transitions**:
  - CR->DV: Claim Registration to Document Verification
  - DV->FC: Document Verification to Fraud Check
  - FC->CA: Fraud Check to Claim Assessment
  - CA->AP: Claim Assessment to Approval
  - AP->P: Approval to Payment
  - P->N: Payment to Notification
  - N->CL: Notification to Closure

- **Initial Marking**: Places are tokenized as follows: `CR=1`

- **Final Marking**: The places where the process should end with tokens are `P=1`, `N=1`, and `CL=1`.

**Optional Additional Loops**:
- DV->RDS: Document Verification can loop back to Re-Document Submission if documents need re-submission.
- FC->II: Fraud Check can loop back to In-depth Investigation multiple times if doubts persist.

The provided Python code constructs the Petri net and defines both the initial and final markings as per your requirements. The additional loops for possible repeated steps (DV -> RDS and FC -> II) are also included based on the description.
