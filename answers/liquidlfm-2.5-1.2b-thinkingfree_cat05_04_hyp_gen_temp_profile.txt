Alright, let me tackle this. The user wants me to generate hypotheses about the anomalies in the temporal profile model and propose verification methods using SQL queries, based on the given database structure and the example provided. But without referring to the initial instructions or explanations. 

First, looking at the anomalies identified: RP (Receive to Approve) with very low STDEV implies maybe too rigid scheduling. PN is also suspicious because of the long delay. AC is okay but quick close might not fit, EN quick evaluate-to-notify, and NC too quick close.

For hypotheses, I need to think of possible reasons. Like maybe automated systems assigning claims quickly when not supposed to, or manual delays in approval. Or maybe different adjusters are involved in different scenarios. 

For verification methods via SQL, I should think of querying the claims table. Maybe group claims by adjuster, look at times before P and N, see if delays are consistent. Or check if certain time ranges in claim_events have anomalies in timing.

Wait, the user said not to reference previous info, but need to follow the task. Since I need to produce the response without the given explanation, just come up with the hypothesis and queries. 

Hypotheses could be: Maybe the 'RP' anomaly is due to a bottleneck where adjusters are queuing up too much or procedures are too slow. Or perhaps data entry errors causing delays in P. 

For verification queries: Pick specific tables like claims with R followed by P, or P followed by N. Maybe something like SELECT * FROM claims WHERE adjuster_id IN (list_of_adjusters_involved) ORDER BY submission_date DESC WHERE (P-TIMESTAMP - A-TIMESTAMP) exceeds threshold OR something checking for high variance in times.

Alternatively, since the example uses SQL, perhaps grouping by adjuster and checking time gaps between activities. For instance, 

HYPOTHESIS: Anomaly in RP might be due to overuse of automation leading to inconsistent path through the process. 

Verification query: SELECT a.adjuster_name, (claim_event.type) AS type, (TIMESTAMP FROM claim_events.unique_event_id) - (TIMESTAMP FROM claim_events.unique_event_id) AS delta_time WHERE a.adjuster_id LIKE '%x%' AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE event_id IN (SELECT event_id FROM claims WHERE adjuster_id = x)) AND WHERE avg(TIMESTAMP_BETWEEN[R,A,P]... Not sure. Maybe simpler: 

Maybe query for claims where time between R and P is below average or something. Alternatively, group events where P and N are too close. 

Perhaps the key is to target queries that find outliers in time intervals between specific activities. 

So putting it together, the answer should state the anomalies (using my own words) and then the SQL queries to check for these anomalies. Since the user said not to reference prior info, I just need to present hypotheses like possible reasons and then the SQL queries. Let me structure the answer accordingly.

**Hypotheses on Anomalies:**  
- The **RP (ReceiveApprove) anomaly** suggests potential bottlenecks where automated workflows delay approvals, possibly due to insufficient system flexibility or manual intervention.  
- The **PN (ApproveNotify) delay** indicates possible administrative bottlenecks or communication breakdowns between stages, causing extended wait times.  
- The **EN (EvaluateNotify) abrupt transition** implies a mismatch between evaluation delays and subsequent notification (e.g., outdated data or workflow interruptions).  
- The **NC (Close) timeliness issues** hint at irregular resource allocation or procedural inefficiencies affecting final closure.  

**Verification Queries:**  
1. Identify claims where **RP** occurs with average PT < 1 hour and compare against system logs for manual approvals.  
2. Check **PN** delays > 1 hour to correlate with adjuster availability or communication delays.  
3. Filter **EN** events between 9 AM–11 AM local time to assess potential scheduling conflicts.  
4. Cross-reference **NC** events with insufficient employee staff during specified time windows.  
Use aggregations: `SELECT adjuster_id, AVG(timestamp) AS avg_before P, AVG(timestamp) AS avg_after N WHERE P_TIMESTAMP - A_TIMESTAMP > threshold GROUP BY adjuster_id`.
