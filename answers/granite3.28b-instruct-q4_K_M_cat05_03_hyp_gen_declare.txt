### Anomalies Identification

1. **Conflicting 'responded_existence' Rule for Activity 'E'**:
   - The rule states that `E` (Evaluate Claim) can occur only after an `A` (Assign Adjuster). However, it also implies that this `E` should have a high support and confidence, suggesting it's common. This conflicts with the requirement of assigning an adjuster before evaluation as per the intended process flow.

2. **Inconsistent 'precedence' Rule for Activity 'C'**:
   - The rule indicates that `C` (Close Claim) can occur only after a `R` (Receive Claim). While this aligns with the process, it doesn't account for other intermediary steps (`A`, `E`, and `P`) necessary according to the intended flow.

3. **Violation of Sequence in 'noncoexistence' Rule**:
   - This rule suggests that while an `E` (Evaluate Claim) is happening, a `C` (Close Claim) should not occur simultaneously. Yet, it doesn't enforce the temporal aspect of when these activities happen relative to each other, allowing potential overlap.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Logic**:
   - The model may have been created based on a partial understanding or misinterpretation of the business process. For instance, the high support and confidence assigned to `E` without explicit predecessor `A` might reflect an attempt to prioritize evaluations over proper adjuster assignment.

2. **Policy Changes Not Fully Integrated**:
   - As policies evolved, not all changes were uniformly reflected in the model's constraints. For example, the precedence rule for `C` only considers `R`, ignoring subsequent steps (`A`, `E`, `P`), possibly due to outdated information about the updated claim handling procedure.

3. **Data Limitations or Technical Issues**:
   - The anomalies might stem from incomplete data or technical constraints in formulating the model. For instance, the inability to capture precise timestamps for activities could lead to rules that oversimplify the sequential nature of claim processing.

4. **Pressure to Streamline Claim Handling**:
   - There might be an external pressure to expedite claims processing, leading to rules that inadvertently allow skipping crucial steps (`E` before `A`), potentially compromising accuracy and thoroughness.

### SQL-based Investigation Approaches

1. **Claims Closed Without Evaluation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id 
   FROM claims c 
   LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C' 
   WHERE ce.event_id IS NOT NULL AND ce.activity != 'E';
   ```

2. **Concurrent Evaluation and Closure**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c1.claim_id, c1.*, c2.* 
   FROM claim_events c1 
   JOIN claim_events c2 ON c1.claim_id = c2.claim_id AND (c1.activity = 'E' AND c2.activity = 'C') 
   WHERE c1.timestamp < c2.timestamp;
   ```

3. **Evaluation Without Assigned Adjuster**:
   ```sql
   SELECT ce.* 
   FROM claim_events ce 
   LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id AND ce.activity = 'E' 
   WHERE a.adjuster_id IS NULL;
   ```
