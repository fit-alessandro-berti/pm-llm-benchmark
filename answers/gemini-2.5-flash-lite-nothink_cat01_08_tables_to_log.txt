Here is the integrated event log, derived from the provided ERP tables, formatted for process mining.

**Assumptions Made:**

*   **Picking Activity Aggregation:** For a given order, if multiple items are picked around the same time by the same picker, they are considered part of a single "Items Picked" event for simplicity. If picking times or pickers differ significantly, separate events might be considered. In this case, distinct picking timestamps and picker IDs for the same `order_id` in the `Order Lines` table suggest distinct picking events. We will create one "Items Picked" event per distinct `item_picking_date` and `picker_id` combination for a given order.
*   **Delivery Activity Granularity:** Each `delivery_id` represents a distinct dispatch and arrival event. For orders with multiple delivery records, each dispatch and arrival will be recorded as separate events.
*   **Invoice Activity Granularity:** Each `invoice_id` represents a distinct "Invoice Issued" event. An order can have multiple invoices, hence multiple "Invoice Issued" events.
*   **Payment Activity Granularity:** Each `payment_id` represents a distinct "Payment Received" event. An invoice can have multiple payments, hence multiple "Payment Received" events.
*   **Resource Mapping:** Resource IDs (like `sales_person_id`, `picker_id`, `billing_person_id`) are mapped to names and roles using the `Resources` table. For carrier IDs, we'll use the carrier ID directly as the resource if a separate mapping isn't explicitly provided, or use a generic "Carrier" resource.
*   **Case ID:** `order_id` is used as the Case ID.
*   **Chronological Order:** Events are strictly ordered by their timestamps within each case.
*   **Missing Data:** No significant data gaps were found that prevented the creation of the event log.
