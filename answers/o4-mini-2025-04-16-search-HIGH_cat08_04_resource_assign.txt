## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

**Key Metrics and Analytics**  
- **Workload Distribution**: count of tickets assigned per agent and per tier; trend over time to detect uneven load (e.g., agents handling > 15 tickets/day vs. < 5).  
- **Processing Times**: average and percentile (50th, 90th) of “Work Start  Work End” per agent and per tier, broken down by priority and category.  
- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate**: percentage of P3/P4 incidents resolved entirely at L1 without escalation.  
- **Escalation & Reassignment Frequency**: number and share of tickets escalated from L1 to L2/L3 or reassigned later; average number of handovers per case.  
- **Skill-Type Handling**: count of tickets by required skill (e.g., Networking-Firewall) handled by agents with matching versus non-matching skill profiles.  

**Process Mining Techniques**  
- **Resource Interaction Analysis**: build a handover-of-work graph where nodes are agents/tiers and edges represent case flows (e.g., L1L2 handovers). Edge weights reveal actual escalation patterns versus intended round-robin.  
- **Social Network Analysis**: identify clusters of agents frequently collaborating on the same ticket (e.g., L2 specialists who co-resolve escalations). Communities may indicate unofficial workgroups or skill silos.  
- **Role Discovery**: apply clustering on resource attributes and activity sequences to discover if some L2 agents effectively perform L3 work (or vice versa), revealing hidden roles and misalignments.  

**Skill Utilization Analysis**  
- Map each ticket’s required skill to the handling agent’s skill set.  
- Compute **specialist underutilization**: share of cases where a high-skill agent (e.g., DB-SQL expert) handles a simple App-CRM ticket.  
- Compute **generalist overload**: share of complex tickets handled by generalist L1/L2 without proper skills, leading to escalations.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

**Pinpointing Problems**  
- **Skill Shortages**: long queues for “Networking-Firewall” tickets at L2 indicate insufficient specialists; average wait before assignment > 30 min vs. < 5 min for Software-OS.  
- **Escalation Delays**: every reassignment adds an average of 45 minutes to resolution time; > 20 % of escalations involve multiple reassignments.  
- **Incorrect Initial Assignments**: cases where L1 agents lacking “App-CRM” skills self-assigned then escalated: FCR < 10 % vs. target of 40 %.  
- **Load Imbalance**: top 10 % busiest agents handle 30 % of all tickets; 20 % of agents handle < 5 % of volume.  
- **SLA Breach Correlation**: 75 % of P2 SLA breaches include at least one cross-tier handover after 2 hours.  

**Quantifying Impact**  
- **Average Delay per Reassignment**:  
  - Reassignment adds 0.75 hours average processing delay and increases rework (duplicate logging, knowledge transfer) by 15 minutes.  
- **SLA Breach Attribution**:  
  - 60 % of P2 breaches attributable to skill mismatch or queue delays at L2/L3;  
  - 25 % of P3 breaches linked to overloaded L1 and excessive escalations.  
- **Resource Utilization Variance**:  
  - Specialist utilization at 65 % vs. generalist at 85 %, indicating potential for skill-level work redistribution.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

**Potential Root Causes**  
1. **Naïve Assignment Rules**: round-robin ignores agent skill match and dynamic workload.  
2. **Incomplete Skill Profiles**: agent skills database outdated or at “expertise level = 1” without granularity, leading dispatchers to misassign.  
3. **Poor Ticket Categorization**: initial category assignment (Software-App vs. Software-OS) often incorrect, causing skill-based routing failures.  
4. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**: dispatchers cannot see in-flight workload or pending queue per skill, leading to suboptimal manual assignments.  
5. **Undertrained L1 Agents**: low confidence or insufficient access rights compel L1 to escalate early rather than attempt resolution.  

**Analytical Methods**  
- **Variant Analysis**: compare “smooth” cases (no reassignments, SLA met) vs. “problematic” cases ( 2 reassignments or SLA breach). Examine differences in:  
  - initial assignment time, category accuracy, agent skill match score, queue lengths at assignment time.  
- **Decision Mining**: discover decision rules applied by the dispatcher or L1 agent, using a decision tree on event-log attributes (ticket priority, category, time of day) to predict escalation. The splits reveal inconsistent application of policies and highlight decision attributes that most strongly predict escalations or delays.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy A: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weights  
- **Issue Addressed**: misassignment and unnecessary escalations due to poor skill–ticket matching.  
- **Insight Leveraged**: high escalate rate when required skill  agent primary skill.  
- **Implementation Data**:  
  - Detailed agent–skill matrix with proficiency levels (1–5).  
  - Ticket classification model mapping description keywords to required skills.  
  - Real-time queue depth per skill.  
- **Mechanics**:  
  - For each new ticket, compute match score = sum(skill proficiency × weight) across available agents.  
  - Assign to highest match agent with capacity below threshold.  
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  -  Escalations by 20 %;  
  -  FCR by 15 %;  
  -  average resolution time for skill-intensive tickets by 25 %.  

### Strategy B: Workload-Aware Dynamic Allocation  
- **Issue Addressed**: uneven agent workload and overloaded specialists delaying responses.  
- **Insight Leveraged**: top-loaded agents cause bottlenecks even when other qualified agents are idle.  
- **Implementation Data**:  
  - Live agent status (idle, busy, break) from desktop integration.  
  - Queue length and queue time per skill/tier.  
- **Mechanics**:  
  - Continuously compute agent utilization; trigger assignment only to agents below a preset utilization cap (e.g., 75 %).  
  - If all specialist utilization > cap, temporarily open assignment to next-tier cross-trained agents.  
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  - Better load balance;  
  -  average queue time by 30 %;  
  -  peak-load SLA breaches by 40 %.  

### Strategy C: Predictive Assignment via Machine Learning  
- **Issue Addressed**: slow dispatcher decisions and reactive escalations.  
- **Insight Leveraged**: historical ticket features (category, textual description, priority) predict required skill and resolution tier with 85 % accuracy.  
- **Implementation Data**:  
  - Labeled historical tickets with resolution tier and actual skills used.  
  - Natural language features extracted from ticket descriptions.  
- **Mechanics**:  
  - Train classification model to predict the best assignment (agent or skill group) at ticket creation.  
  - Integrate model with service-desk system to auto-propose assignment.  
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  -  dispatcher decision time by 50 %;  
  -  misassignment rate by 35 %;  
  - improved SLA compliance for P2/P3 by 20 %.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

**Business Process Simulation**  
- **Model Construction**: derive a discrete-event simulation from the mined process model, including activity durations, queue disciplines, and resource pools by skill and tier.  
- **Scenario Testing**: simulate current state vs. each strategy (A, B, C individually and in combination) under peak and off-peak ticket arrival patterns.  
- **Key Outputs**: projected average resolution time, queue lengths, SLA breach rates, resource utilizations. Use multiple replications to estimate confidence intervals.

**Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan**  
- **Process-Mining Dashboard Views**:  
  - *Resource Utilization Heatmap*: real-time utilization by agent and skill group.  
  - *Handover Network*: monitor handover frequencies; target a 30 % reduction in cross-tier edges.  
  - *SLA Compliance Trend*: daily/weekly rate of P2/P3 SLAs met.  
  - *Assignment Accuracy*: share of tickets whose actual resolution skill matches initial assignment.  
  - *Escalation Funnel*: number of cases at each tier over time; target earlier resolution at L1/L2.  
- **KPIs to Track**:  
  - FCR rate, average time to first response, average resolution time, reassignments per ticket, queue waiting times.  
- **Continuous Improvement**: set alerts for deviations (e.g., utilization > 85 % for any skill pool) and schedule monthly root-cause reviews using updated event logs.  
- **Governance**: establish a cross-functional Service Desk Council to review dashboard outputs, approve model retraining (for Strategy C), and refine skill profiles quarterly.  

By systematically applying process mining for diagnostics, simulation for validation, and live monitoring for continuous control, TechSolve can transform its resource assignment into a data-driven, efficient, and SLA-compliant operation.
