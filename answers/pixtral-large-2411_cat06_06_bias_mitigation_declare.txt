To address the potential bias in the loan application review process, we can introduce several constraints to ensure fairness and consistency in decision-making. Here is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints, followed by a rationale for each added constraint.

### Updated `declare_model` Dictionary
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

1. **Existence Constraints:**
   - Added `"ManualReview"` and `"BiasMitigationCheck"` to ensure these activities must occur in every trace. This ensures that manual reviews and bias mitigation checks are performed.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - For `"Approve_Minority"` and `"Reject_Minority"`, added coexistence with `"ManualReview"`. This ensures that whenever a decision is made involving applicants from sensitive demographics, a manual review is also conducted, promoting fairness.

3. **Response Constraints:**
   - Added response constraints from `"CheckApplicantRace"`, `"CheckApplicantGender"`, and `"CheckApplicantAge"` to `"BiasMitigationCheck"`. This ensures that whenever sensitive attributes are checked, a bias mitigation check follows, reducing the likelihood of biased decisions.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - Added succession constraints from `"BiasMitigationCheck"` to `"Approve"` and `"Reject"`. This ensures that after a bias mitigation check, the decision steps are valid, thus adding a layer of scrutiny before final decisions.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - Added non-succession constraints from `"CheckApplicantRace"`, `"CheckApplicantGender"`, and `"CheckApplicantAge"` to `"Reject"`. This prevents direct rejections based on sensitive attributes, thereby mitigating immediate biased outcomes.

By introducing these constraints, we ensure a more equitable and transparent loan application review process, reducing the potential for bias based on sensitive attributes like applicant age, gender, and race.
