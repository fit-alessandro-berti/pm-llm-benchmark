Certainly! Let's carefully analyze the event log.

---

### **Part 1: Identify recurring activities with contextual differences**

From the log, these activities appear multiple times within the same case:

- **Verify Documents** in cases C001 and C003
- **Call Customer** in cases C001, C002, and C003

---

### **Part 2: Interpret context and rename**

**a) Verify Documents**

- **Context A (initial verification):** The first occurrence is the baseline document verification upon request initiation.
  
- **Context B (re-verification or follow-up verification):** The second occurrence typically comes after the customer provides more info or after account adjustments, indicating it is a check after changes.

**b) Call Customer**

- **Context A (clarification/follow-up request):** An outbound call to request missing info or clarify discrepancies.
  
- **Context B (confirmation):** A follow-up to confirm prior adjustments or next steps.
  
- **Context C (request return):** Contacting an in-person customer who stepped out, inviting them back.
