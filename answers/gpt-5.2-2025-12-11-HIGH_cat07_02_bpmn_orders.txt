The visualization is a **BPMN-style process diagram** showing an endtoend **order fulfillment workflow** across four swimlanes (departments):

- **Sales (top lane)**: Triggered on **“Monday morning”** (timer start). Sales **checks the order for completeness**, then **checks whether the customer exists in a database**. If the customer is not found, Sales **adds the customer to the database** (data store symbol). After that, Sales **sends the order details** (message) and later, once shipping is confirmed, **drafts an invoice** and ends.

- **Production**: Receives the **order details** (message event), then **plans production** and **manufactures the product**. Completion is marked by a **“Product complete”** event.

- **Procurement**: Also receives **order details**. It contains a **“Material Compensation Subprocess”** that includes **ordering materials** and the possibility to **return material** (compensation/rollback behavior). Procurement then **checks materials**; depending on the outcome, the process can proceed or lead to **order cancellation**.

- **Warehouse (bottom lane)**: Triggered by **product completion**, then **sends the product**, producing a **“Product sent”** event.

Dashed connectors indicate **message flows** between departments (e.g., order details, product complete/sent notifications), while gateways (diamonds) show **decision/merge points** such as “customer in database vs. not” and material-related outcomes.
