**Explanation of Added Constraints:**

1. **Non-Succession Constraints between Sensitive Attribute Checks and FinalDecision:**
   - **Purpose:** Prevents the process from moving directly from checking a sensitive attribute to making a final decision, which could lead to biased outcomes.
   - **Constraints Added:**
     - `"nonsuccession": { "CheckApplicantRace": { "FinalDecision": {...} }, ... }`

2. **Response Constraints from Sensitive Attribute Checks to BiasMitigationCheck and ManualReview:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that after a sensitive attribute is checked, the system performs bias mitigation and manual review before deciding.
   - **Constraints Added:**
     - `"response": { "CheckApplicantRace": { "BiasMitigationCheck": {...}, "ManualReview": {...} }, ... }`

3. **Precedence Constraints of BiasMitigationCheck and ManualReview before FinalDecision:**
   - **Purpose:** Enforces that bias mitigation and manual review occur before any final decision, adding checks to reduce bias.
   - **Constraints Added:**
     - `"precedence": { "FinalDecision": { "BiasMitigationCheck": {...}, "ManualReview": {...} } }`

4. **Coexistence Constraints between FinalDecision and ManualReview:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that a manual review always occurs whenever a final decision is made, promoting fairness through human oversight.
   - **Constraints Added:**
     - `"coexistence": { "FinalDecision": { "ManualReview": {...} }, "ManualReview": { "FinalDecision": {...} } }`

**How These Constraints Reduce Bias:**

- **Introduce Mandatory Checks:** By adding constraints that require `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` after checking sensitive attributes, we ensure that every decision involving sensitive data is carefully evaluated for potential bias.
- **Prevent Immediate Decisions Based on Sensitive Data:** The non-succession constraints stop the system from making immediate decisions after accessing sensitive attributes, reducing the risk of snap judgments based on bias.
- **Encourage Fair Decision-Making:** The precedence and coexistence constraints enforce a workflow where decisions are made after thorough review and bias mitigation, leading to more consistent and fair outcomes for all applicants.

These added constraints collectively work to make the loan application review process more equitable by requiring additional steps whenever sensitive attributes are involved, thereby mitigating potential biases.
