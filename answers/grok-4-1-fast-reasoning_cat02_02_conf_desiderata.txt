### 1. Normative Rule Violations
Normative rules are **strict** and must be followed without exception. Violations include skipping steps, reversing order, or performing contradictory actions.

- **Case 1**: **No violations**. The process follows the exact required sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. All ordering rules are satisfied, and actions align with the approval outcome (documentation finalized before closing).

- **Case 2**: **Multiple violations**:
  - **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check** (08:20 vs. 09:00): Violates the ordering rule that Credit Check *must* precede Risk Assessment.
  - **Inform Applicant skipped entirely**: This step is mandatory after Loan Decision, regardless of approval/rejection status.
  - **Finalize Documentation after Loan Rejection** (10:00, after 09:30 rejection): Contradictory action; documentation must *not* be finalized in rejection cases.
  These represent serious deviations from the normative process.

- **Case 3**: **No violations**. The sequence is fully adhered to: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. Ordering is correct, and post-approval steps (Finalize before Close) are properly executed.

### 2. Desiderata Failures (Recommended Best Practices)
Desiderata are **not strict**—violations are suboptimal but not serious infractions. They include timely Credit Check (~24 hours post-application), prompt Inform Applicant (~48 hours post-decision), and a Follow-up Call before case closure.

- **Case 1**: Minor desiderata gap.
  - No Follow-up Call recorded (encouraged before Close Case).
  - Timings are excellent (Credit Check ~30 min post-app; Inform ~2 hours post-decision), so no timing issues.
  - **Suboptimal but not severe**: Process is efficient overall.

- **Case 2**: Desiderata not meaningfully assessable due to normative violations, but for completeness:
  - Credit Check ~1 hour post-app (acceptable).
  - No Inform Applicant at all (worse than late).
  - No Follow-up Call.
  - **Suboptimal**, but overshadowed by strict violations.

- **Case 3**: Several desiderata gaps.
  - Credit Check ~48 hours post-app (Jan 12 09:00 to Jan 14 10:00; exceeds ~24-hour preference).
  - Inform Applicant ~51 hours post-decision (Jan 14 12:00 to Jan 16 15:00; exceeds ~48-hour preference).
  - No Follow-up Call recorded.
  - **Suboptimal behavior**: Delays suggest inefficiencies (e.g., backlog), but fully compliant with strict rules.

### 3. Interpretations and Justifications
Where behaviors align with constraints, they can be viewed positively. For deviations:

- **Case 1**: Ideal execution—could represent a "best-case" workflow under normal conditions, justifying it as a benchmark for efficiency.

- **Case 2**:
  - **Possible interpretation for ordering reversal**: Credit Check may have been initiated concurrently or informally before 08:20 Risk Assessment but logged late (e.g., system delay). However, this does *not* excuse the log violation.
  - **Finalize after rejection**: Could be a clerical error (e.g., template reuse) rather than intentional, but still unjustifiable under rules.
  - **Missing Inform**: Perhaps bundled into Close Case notification, but skips explicit step—unacceptable without evidence.
  - Overall, suggests process breakdown (e.g., understaffing); requires audit.

- **Case 3**:
  - **Delays in Credit Check/Inform**: Justifiable as workload backlog or external factors (e.g., holidays Jan 12-14), aligning with rules since no ordering/skippage occurred. Still suboptimal for customer experience.
  - **No Follow-up Call**: Could be deemed unnecessary due to applicant responsiveness (inferred from progression), as it's only encouraged—not required.
  - Represents a "delayed but compliant" process, acceptable in high-volume scenarios.
