### Business Process Explanation

The described pseudo-BPMN diagram represents a process for handling customer requests, which can be categorized into either "Standard" or "Custom" requests. The business process involves validating the request, performing feasibility studies (if necessary), obtaining approval (if required), generating an invoice, and finally communicating with the customer. Let's break down each part and understand the flows and decision points.

#### Start Event: "Receive Customer Request"
- **Purpose:** Initial entry point into the process where the customer's request is received by the system or service department.

#### Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"
- **Purpose:** A decision point where the request type determines the path the process will follow.
  - **If Type = Standard:** Moves to Task B1.
  - **If Type = Custom:** Moves to Task B2.

##### For Standard Requests:
- **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
  - **Purpose:** Ensure that the standard request meets all predefined criteria and regulations.

- **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
  - **Purpose:** Coordinate several validation tasks to be performed simultaneously.
    - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
      - **Purpose:** Verify the customer's creditworthiness.
    - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
      - **Purpose:** Confirm that the requested items are in stock and available to be delivered.

- **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
  - **Purpose:** After all parallel tasks in Task C1 and Task C2 are completed, a join occurs to synchronize the results.

- **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
  - **Purpose:** Determine the expected delivery date based on the results of the previous checks and inventory status.

##### For Custom Requests:
- **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
  - **Purpose:** Evaluate the feasibility of fulfilling a custom request based on resource availability, time constraints, and other relevant factors.

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
  - **Purpose:** Decide whether the custom request can be fulfilled based on the analysis.
    - **If Yes:** Moves to Task E1.
    - **If No:** Moves to Task E2.

  - **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
    - **Purpose:** Draft a detailed quotation for the custom request, outlining price, delivery time, and other relevant information.

  - **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
    - **Purpose:** Communicate with the customer that the custom request cannot be fulfilled, providing reasons for rejection.

  - **End Event**
    - **Purpose:** Terminate the process following a rejection.

#### Converging Path Post-Request Type Analysis:
- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
  - **Purpose:** Determine the necessity of managerial approval based on company policy and request specifics.
    - **If Yes:** Proceed to Task F.
    - **If No:** Skip to Task G.

- **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
  - **Purpose:** Request approval from a manager or higher authority to proceed with fulfilling the request.

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
  - **Purpose:** Evaluate whether the manager has approved the request.
    - **If Yes:** Proceed to Task G.
    - **If No:** Trigger a loop back to Task E1 (if it was a custom request) or Task D (if it was a standard request).

- **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
  - **Purpose:** Create a final invoice detailing the charges for the fulfilled request, ready for customer billing.

- **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
  - **Purpose:** Revisit and reassess the conditions or constraints leading to the denial of approval to determine if other adjustments or reconsiderations can be made.

- **Loop Back:** This step allows additional iterations of evaluation and approval seeking, ensuring the request is either successfully processed or appropriately managed.

#### Final Step:
- **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
  - **Purpose:** Notify the customer about the status of their request, whether it was fulfilled successfully, a custom quotation was issued, or the request was rejected.

- **End Event**
  - **Purpose:** Signal the completion of the process irrespective of the outcome (fulfillment, quotation, or rejection).

### Summary of Convergence, Divergence, and Loops:
- **Divergence:** The choice between standard and custom processing paths.
- **Convergence:** After parallel validations in standard requests, and via managerial approval in both paths.
- **Loop Back:** Possible re-evaluation if approval is not initially granted, ensuring that rework is accounted for as per business rules.

### Task Differences Based on Request Type:
- **Standard Requests** involve predefined checks ensuring compliance with standard operating procedures.
- **Custom Requests** require additional analysis and feasibility studies before they can be processed, introducing more specialized decision-making.

### Conditions for Approvals and Rework:
- **Approval Needed:** Determined based on internal policies and could pertain to financial thresholds, risk factors, etc.
- **Rework:** Only necessary if approval is denied, prompting a reassessment or further clarification/re-negotiation, focusing on identification of new pathways to approval.
