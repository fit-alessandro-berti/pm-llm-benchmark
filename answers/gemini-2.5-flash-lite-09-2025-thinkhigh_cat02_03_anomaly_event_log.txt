The Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process relies on a strict sequence of authorization, commitment, fulfillment, and settlement. Anomalies occur when steps that should depend on each other are executed out of order, indicating potential control bypasses, data entry errors, or non-compliant purchasing behavior.

Based on standard P2P best practices, the following anomalies were identified in the event log:

---

## Summary of Anomalies

| Case ID | Anomaly Description | Why it is Problematic (Business Impact) |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1002** | Approval occurs *after* Payment Release. | Bypasses internal controls; payment made without formal authorization for the expenditure. |
| **1003** | Payment Release occurs *before* Invoice Receipt and Goods Receipt. | Indicates potential advance payment without verification, or severe data logging errors. Risk of paying for goods/services never received. |
| **1004** | Goods Receipt occurs *before* the Purchase Order is Issued. | Violates commitment control. Goods are accepted without a corresponding authorized commitment, leading to "blind receipts" and potential budgetary overrun. |

## Detailed Analysis of Anomalous Cases

### Case 1002 Analysis

**Sequence Showing Anomaly:**
1. `Issue Purchase Order` (Feb 1, 08:40)
2. `Vendor Invoice Received` (Feb 3, 07:00)
3. `Release Payment` (Feb 3, 07:15)
4. **`Approve Purchase Requisition` (Feb 3, 08:00)**

**Explanation of Problematic Behavior:**
In a standard P2P flow, the **Approval of the Purchase Requisition** is the foundational step that authorizes the creation of the commitment (the PO). In Case 1002, the PO was issued, the invoice was processed, and **payment was released** *before* the original requisition was formally approved.

*   **Impact:** This signifies a critical failure in financial control. Funds were committed and paid out without the necessary governance or budgetary sign-off, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized spending or fraud.

### Case 1003 Analysis

**Sequence Showing Anomaly:**
1. `Issue Purchase Order` (Feb 2, 10:00)
2. **`Release Payment` (Feb 8, 11:00)**
3. **`Vendor Invoice Received` (Feb 9, 12:00)**
4. **`Receive Goods` (Feb 10, 13:00)**

**Explanation of Problematic Behavior:**
Payment is typically the final step, contingent upon receiving a valid invoice that matches the PO and the goods receipt documentation (a 3-way match). In Case 1003, the **Release Payment** occurred six days *before* the system registered the receipt of the **Vendor Invoice** and one day before the system registered the **Goods Receipt**.

*   **Impact:** This pattern strongly suggests an **advance payment** without proper validation (like a confirmed invoice or goods receipt), or it indicates a significant data entry lag where the payment step was logged prematurely. This violates the core principle of Accounts Payable: "Pay only what has been billed and validated."

### Case 1004 Analysis

**Sequence Showing Anomaly:**
1. `Approve Purchase Requisition` (Feb 5, 10:15)
2. **`Receive Goods` (Feb 6, 09:00)**
3. **`Issue Purchase Order` (Feb 6, 09:15)**

**Explanation of Problematic Behavior:**
The **Purchase Order (PO)** is the legally binding commitment document that authorizes a supplier to deliver goods or services. Standard procedure requires the PO to be issued *before* the goods are received, ensuring the recipient knows they are accepting items under an authorized procurement contract. In Case 1004, the goods were physically received before the PO was formally generated in the system.

*   **Impact:** This is known as receiving goods without a PO ("blind receipt"). It means the receiving department accepted liability for goods without a corresponding budget commitment. This can lead to inventory accounting issues, difficulty resolving invoice discrepancies, and uncontrolled purchasing exposure.
