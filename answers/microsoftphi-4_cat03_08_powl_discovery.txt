To construct a Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) model for the given event log, we need to capture the relationships and operations performed in each case flow. Let's outline the steps and the corresponding POWL model structure:

### Key Observations:

1. **Sequential Flow for Core Activities:**
   - The process always begins with "Order Received" (OR), followed by "Material Sourcing" (MS), "Quality Screening" (QS), and "Assembly" (AS).

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - "In-line Quality Check" (IQC) may loop multiple times before proceeding with testing.
   - If "Testing" (TST) fails, "Re-Testing" (RT) occurs, potentially looping between TST and RT until it passes.

3. **Choice Structures:**
   - "Labeling" (LB) can be optionally skipped.

4. **Subsequent Steps:**
   - The activities "Packaging" (PK), "Distribution Planning" (DP), and "Dispatch" (D) follow after testing and quality is assured.

### POWL Model Construction:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define core activity transitions
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

# Define a choice for labeling being optional
skip_lb = SilentTransition()
xor_lb = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[LB, skip_lb]
)

# Define loops
iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[IQC, AS]
)
tst_rt_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[TST, RT]
)

# Combined with subsequent activities
post_testing = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[tst_rt_loop, PK, xor_lb, DP, D]
)

# Final assembly node
assembly_quality_check = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[iqc_loop, post_testing]
)

# Root node representing the entire process
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, assembly_quality_check])

# Define the execution order
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, assembly_quality_check)

# The loop and choice are self-contained relative to their nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Core Sequence**: OR -> MS -> QS is directly ordered and sequential.
- **assembly_quality_check**: Encapsulates the loop structures involving IQC and AS, as well as subsequent testing and packaging steps.
- **iqc_loop**: Allows multiple iterations of "Assembly" following "In-line Quality Check" until the desired quality level is reached.
- **tst_rt_loop**: Handles the loop between "Testing" and "Re-Testing" until a successful pass.
- **xor_lb**: Models the exclusive choice between "Labeling" and skipping it.
- **post_testing**: Sequences the post-testing and dispatch activities.
- **Loops and choices are hierarchically structured within their respective nodes but adhere to the partial ordering specified.**

This POWL model effectively captures the essence of the complex manufacturing and distribution processes outlined in the event log.
