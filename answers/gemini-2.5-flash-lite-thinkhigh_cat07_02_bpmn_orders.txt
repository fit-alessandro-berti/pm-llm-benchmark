This visualization depicts a business process for handling customer orders, broken down across four key departments or lanes: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

**Sales Lane:**
The process originates from a **Timer Start Event** at "Monday morning." The Sales department first performs a **Task** to "Check order for completeness." Following this, they execute a **Task** to "Check if customer is already in the database." An **Exclusive Gateway** then determines the next step based on the customer's database status. If the customer is "Customer not in the database," their information is added via the **Task** "Add customer to the database," interacting with a **Data Store** labeled "database." Once this is complete (or if the customer was already in the database), the flow proceeds. The Sales department then performs the **Task** "Send order details," which generates a message sent to both Production and Procurement. Internally, Sales continues with the **Task** "Draft invoice," and the sales-specific part of the process concludes with an **End Event**.

**Production Lane:**
The Production department's process is initiated by a **Message Start Event** labeled "Order details arrive," triggered by the message from Sales. The department then carries out the **Tasks** "Plan production" and "Manufacture product." Upon successful manufacturing, a **Message Throwing Intermediate Event** signals "Product complete," sending a message to the Warehouse. Additionally, a dashed line from the "Manufacture product" task carries a signal or message labeled "Material not faulty" towards the Procurement lane, indicating a status of the materials used.

**Procurement Lane:**
This lane also begins with a **Message Start Event** labeled "Order details arrive," receiving the order information from Sales. This triggers a **Subprocess** named "Material Compensation Subprocess." Within this subprocess, the primary **Tasks** are "Order materials" and "Check materials." The "Order materials" task is followed by a **Timer Intermediate Catch Event** (set for 30 minutes), which then leads to the **Task** "Return material." The "Check materials" task is critical; if issues are detected or if there's a dependency that leads to an order cancellation, the process can transition to a **Terminating End Event** labeled "Order cancellation," effectively halting the order.

**Warehouse Lane:**
The Warehouse department's involvement starts with a **Message Start Event** which receives the "Product complete" message from the Production lane. The department then executes the **Task** "Send product." This action concludes the warehouse operations with a **Message End Event** labeled "Product sent."

**Key Interactions:**
*   The Sales department initiates the overall process by sending "Order details" as messages to Production and Procurement.
*   Production informs the Warehouse about the completion of the product via a "Product complete" message to trigger shipping.
*   A signal "Material not faulty" is communicated from Production to Procurement, likely as feedback on material usage.
*   The Procurement department's material checking process can lead to an "Order cancellation," which impacts the continuation of the entire order fulfillment.
