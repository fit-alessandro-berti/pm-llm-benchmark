When comparing the process variants of the protected group (first) and the unprotected group (second), you might notice several key differences:

1. **Expert examinations are more common for the unprotected group**: The process variants with the "Expert Examination" step occur much more frequently for the unprotected group as compared to the protected group. This could imply that the unprotected group goes through more detailed diagnostic examinations, which could be indicative of a higher level of care provided, but also possibly a higher workload for specialists.

2. **Higher use of thorough examinations**: Similarly, a greater number of process variants for the unprotected group include the "Thorough Examination" step. This might suggest an emphasis on comprehensive diagnostics for the unprotected group, which could translate into better treatment outcomes, but also potentially longer waiting times and administrative processes.

3. **Inconsistent treatment and discharge paths for the unprotected group**: Certain statuses for the unprotected group, like "Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" (frequency = 640012.077), are unique to them and more frequent. This highlights that there might be inconsistent paths to successful treatment and/or a higher rate of unsuccessful treatments needing repeated cycles of diagnosis and treatment before a successful discharge.

4. **Discharge only paths are more predominant in the protected group**: For the protected group, which also includes patients without reported process variants after registration and a few others ("Register at ER", "Register at FD"), there's more focus on direct pathways through treatment and discharge. This could suggest that once registered, the protected patients either bypass unnecessary processes or undergo more streamlined care environments.

5. **A significantly higher frequency of entirely different path variations for both groups**: This could point to different standard operating procedures or policies that might cater to the financial or legal distinctions between the protected and unprotected groups.

6. **Different nature of treatment and outcomes in specific processes**: Processes like "Register at ER", "Register at FD", and direct "Discharge" variances in the protected group might indicate superior or quicker care pathways, higher resource availability, or more direct patient outcomes, when compared to the more complex and detailed processes in the unprotected group.

Given that the protected group often shows shorter performance times, while the unprotected group deals with frequency and performance times ranging up to 1,000,000+ for certain variations, it suggests potential disparities in the healthcare facilities' resource allocation or variations in the care models designed for the two groups. These differences cannot be
