**Case Study Analysis and Recommendations:**

**1. Process Discovery & Conformance Checking:**

- **Data Preprocessing & Integration:** The data from the various sources was integrated by identifying events with the same timestamp and mapping affected fields (such as package IDs, drivers, locations, and vehicle types). This ensures the event logs are consistent and comparable across different systems.
- **Visualization & Model Comparison:** Awpach kan dengan visualisasi Received endpoint via Plato, suatu diagram yang menunjukkan logika pengeraman sejagneticu. Ini dip bandingkan dengan logika pengeraman yang planned (seperti rute Research, permintaan bawah, dan un delivery) untuk mendapatkan perentialan Depart and return, pengeraman, danotalisasi. Analyze the discrepancies to understand where the inefficiencies lie.
- **Impact Identification:** The process identified inconsistencies in routes routing, non-planned stops, and inefficiencies in vehicle utilization. Challenges such as static route routing and tight traffic congestion impacted delivery times.

**2. Performance Analysis & Bottlenecks Identification:**

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Define metrics such as On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR), Average Time per Delivery Stop, Travel Time vs. Service Time ratio, Fuel Consumption per km/package, and Vehicle Utilization Rate. These KPIs help evaluate performance and identify bottlenecks.
- **Decomposition & Metrics Application:** Calculated these KPIs to analyze time constraints and inefficiencies. Observed that vehicle utilization rate was lower than planned, and some stops were unexpected.
- **Root Causes:** Identified factors such as inconsistent route routing, intricacies in driver behavior (e.g., late departures), and road traffic congestion impacting delivery times.

**3. Root Cause Analysis & Recommendations:**

Based on root cause identification and KPI analysis:
- **Investigate Specific Factors:** These included static route routing, early departure times, and traffic congestion patterns.
- **Data-Driven Strategies:** Immediately proposed the followingolutions:
  - **Dynamic Routing:** Real-time data, including speed limits, and traffic updates, can be incorporated to adjust routing and reduce delays.
  - **Predictive Maintenance:** Identify factors like speed and dispatch frequency to suggest timely maintenance.
  - **Driver Training:** Introduce on-field training for better route planning and customer service.
  - ** Parking Optimization:** Enhance downtown parking options to speed up deliveries.
  - **Request for Additional Workers:** Implement near parking options when traffic is heavy.

**4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies:**

Proposed optimizations include:
- **Dynamic routing:** Use predictive analytics for real-time adjustments.
- **Predictive maintenance:** Monitor vehicle usage and schedule routine maintenance.
- **Driver training:** Address inefficiencies through additional training.
- **Service communications:** Improve customer interaction and have relays available.
- **Request for additional workers:** Increase crew capacity during peak times.

**5. Operational Constraints and Monitoring:**

Implement strategies to accommodate constraints:
- Adjust routes to avoid congestion and heavy traffic areas.
- Shift arrival drivers to minimize IBT.
- Orient arrival drivers to avoid longer walks.
- Track real-time IBT and route changes to quickly identify new issues.

This comprehensive approach aims to address inefficiencies, reduce costs, and improve delivery punctuality.
