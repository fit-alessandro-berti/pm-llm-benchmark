## Activity Inference and Labeling

We have identified five distinct operational phases, plus the initial and final standby states, based on the patterns observed across the sensor readings.

| Activity Label | Events | Timestamp Range | Key Sensor Patterns |
| :------------- | :----- | :-------------- | :------------------ |
| **A1: Idle/Standby** | 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15 | 08:00:00 - 08:00:10 & 08:01:00 - 08:01:10 | Tool retracted (0), minimal energy consumption (0.4-0.5 kWh), room temperature, zero vibration, zero flow. |
| **A2: Cutting/Machining** | 4, 5, 6 | 08:00:15 - 08:00:25 | High energy (up to 3.00 kWh), high vibration (up to 38 Hz), rapid temperature rise (up to 58°C), active material flow (5 units/s), tool is moving and engaging. |
| **A3: Part Assembly/Pressing**| 7, 8 | 08:00:30 - 08:00:35 | High, stable pressure (2 bar), moderate energy (2.00 kWh), reduced vibration (10 Hz), stabilized tool position (15 mm). Suggests holding or joining parts under force. |
| **A4: Welding/Fusing** | 9 | 08:00:40 | Extreme energy peak (5.00 kWh), highest temperature spike (80°C), sharp vibration peak (50 Hz), but zero material flow. Short, high-intensity heat application. |
| **A5: Cooling and Setup** | 10 | 08:00:45 | Rapid temperature drop (30°C), pressure returns to ambient (1 bar), minimal vibration/energy. Preparing for the next stage. |
| **A6: Quality Inspection** | 11, 12 | 08:00:50 - 08:00:55 | Low energy (1.5–1.6 kWh), low temperature, low steady vibration (5 Hz), tool moves to a new position (20 mm) and stabilizes. Indicates non-destructive analysis (e.g., using light/sensor array). |

## Rationale for Activity Labeling

### A1: Idle/Standby (Events 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15)
**Rationale:** This activity is defined by the absence of work. All physical parameters (Temperature, Pressure, Vibration) are at baseline or ambient levels. Energy consumption is minimal, indicating only control systems or lighting are active. The tool is at its home/retracted position (0 mm).

### A2: Cutting/Machining (Events 4, 5, 6)
**Rationale:** This is the most mechanically intensive activity. The strong simultaneous increases in **Vibration** (up to 38 Hz) and **Energy** (up to 3.00 kWh) suggest heavy mechanical work, such as using a high-speed spindle or blade. The sustained **Material Flow** (5 units/s) confirms raw material is being processed, and the resulting **Temperature** rise is due to friction and material removal.

### A3: Part Assembly/Pressing (Events 7, 8)
**Rationale:** The key indicator here is the **Pressure** stabilizing at its highest point (2 bar), while the **Vibration** drops significantly from the cutting phase. The **Tool Position** is now stable (15 mm). This suggests the machine has placed the cut material and is applying sustained force (pressure) to join or clamp parts together. The moderate energy usage is likely powering the hydraulic or pneumatic systems maintaining the pressure.

### A4: Welding/Fusing (Event 9)
**Rationale:** This activity is characterized by a short, dramatic spike in **Temperature** (80°C) and the absolute highest **Energy** consumption (5.00 kWh). This intense, rapid application of heat strongly points to a welding or localized fusing operation. Crucially, this high-power event occurs with **zero material flow**, confirming no cutting or feeding is happening, only high-heat fusion at the fixed tool position.

### A5: Cooling and Setup (Event 10)
**Rationale:** Immediately following the high-heat welding phase, the temperature drops rapidly (from 80°C to 30°C). All mechanical activities cease, and pressure returns to the low ambient level (1 bar). This is a necessary pause for the newly formed joint to cool before the assembly can be moved or inspected.

### A6: Quality Inspection (Events 11, 12)
**Rationale:** This phase shows very low physical intensity (Vibration 5 Hz, Pressure 1 bar, stable low Temperature). The **Tool Position** moves to a new, fixed location (20 mm) and stabilizes. The moderate, consistent **Energy** consumption suggests sensors (e.g., a camera, laser profiler, or scanner) are active. This pattern is consistent with verifying dimensions, checking weld quality, or performing non-contact measurements before the part is released.
