```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        LIST(activity) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS variant_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
    LIMIT K -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_variants);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`case_sequences` CTE:** This CTE groups the `event_log` by `case_id` and uses the `LIST()` aggregate function along with the `ORDER BY` clause within the `GROUP BY` to create an ordered list of activities for each case. This list represents the activity sequence or process variant for that case.

2. **`variant_counts` CTE:** This CTE takes the `case_sequences` and groups them by `activity_sequence`.  `COUNT(case_id)` calculates the number of cases belonging to each unique variant.

3. **`top_k_variants` CTE:** This CTE orders the `variant_counts` by `variant_count` in descending order and uses `LIMIT K` to select the top K variants.  Replace `K` with the desired integer value (e.g., `LIMIT 5` for the top 5 variants).

4. **Final `SELECT` Statement:** This statement joins the original `event_log` with `case_sequences` on `case_id`.  The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only events from cases whose `activity_sequence` is present in the `top_k_variants` CTE. This effectively filters out events from cases that do not belong to the top K most frequent variants.


**Example with K=2:**

If we set K=2, the query will return all events from the original event log that belong to the cases representing the two most frequent process variants. All other events will be excluded.  Replace `LIMIT K` with `LIMIT 2`.


This improved solution is more concise and directly addresses the prompt's requirements while maintaining efficiency and readability.  It leverages the power of CTEs and DuckDB's `LIST()` aggregate function for ordered aggregation, making it a robust solution for process variant analysis.  It also directly addresses the filtering requirement by including only events associated with the top K variants in the final result. Remember to replace 'K' with the desired number.
