This graphic is a timebased event sequence diagram showing how many “cases” move through three steps of a process.

**Layout**

- The horizontal axis is time, ranging from **20000125** on the left to **20130424** on the right.
- There are three labeled horizontal bands (states) stacked vertically:
  - Top: **Send Fine**
  - Middle: **Insert Fine Notification**
  - Bottom: **Send for Credit Collection**

**Visual encoding**

- Each thin line represents one case (for example, one fine).
- The **top panel** is filled with many vertical grey lines. Each grey line marks a time point where a “Send Fine” event occurred.
- From the middle band (“Insert Fine Notification”) to the bottom band (“Send for Credit Collection”), there are numerous diagonal lines, mostly light red/pink with some darker red:
  - A line starts at the timestamp where the fine notification was inserted and ends at the timestamp when it was sent for credit collection.
  - The **slope/length** of these diagonal lines shows how long it took a fine to move from notification to credit collection. Steep, short lines indicate quick transitions; shallow, long lines indicate longer delays.
- The density of lines in certain periods reveals when many cases were being processed or when delays were common.

**Overall impression**

The plot emphasizes:
- Continuous, highvolume creation/sending of fines over the years.
- A large number of transitions from “Insert Fine Notification” to “Send for Credit Collection,” with highly variable waiting times, shown by the fanlike spread of red lines across the time axis.
