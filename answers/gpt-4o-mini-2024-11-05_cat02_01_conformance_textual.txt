### Identified Violations

**Case 2:**
- **Violation**: "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment."
- **Explanation**: According to the normative process, the "Authorize payment" activity must occur after the "Check inventory" step and before "Package items." In Case 2, "Package items" is executed at 10:00, while "Authorize payment" only happens at 10:30. This violates the required sequence.

**Case 3:**
- **Violation**: "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order."
- **Explanation**: In the normative process, once an order is canceled, it should not proceed to the "Ship order" activity. In Case 3, after the "Cancel order" activity at 10:00, the process continues with "Ship order" at 10:30, which violates the rule that shipping should not occur after cancellation.

**Case 5:**
- **Violation**: "Ship order" occurred before "Authorize payment."
- **Explanation**: According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" must happen before the "Package items" and "Ship order" activities. In Case 5, "Ship order" takes place at 11:00, while "Authorize payment" happens at 10:30. This sequence violates the expected order of events.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2**: "Package items" was done before "Authorize payment."
2. **Case 3**: "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order."
3. **Case 5**: "Ship order" occurred before "Authorize payment."

These violations suggest deviations from the expected process flow where activities were not executed in the correct order according to the normative process.
