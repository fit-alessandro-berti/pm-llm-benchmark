Based on the provided directly follows graph for different object types, it is possible to infer a complex logistics and transportation process involving various stages such as order handling, vehicle booking, container management, loading, unloading, and rescheduling within a warehouse or transport hub. Here's a breakdown of the main processes inferred from this data:

### Customer Order Process
1. **Register Customer Order**: A customer order is registered.
2. **Create Transport Document**: Once an order is registered, a transport document is created for that order.

### Vehicle Booking and Container Handling Processes
- **Transport Document Creation -> Book Vehicles**: After creating the transport document, vehicles are booked to handle the transportation needs of the order.
- **Book Vehicles -> Order Empty Containers**: Following vehicle booking, empty containers may be ordered if needed.
- **Order Empty Containers -> Pick Up Empty Container**: Once the order for empty containers is placed, these containers are picked up.
- **Pick Up Empty Container -> Load Truck**: The empty containers are loaded onto a truck.

### Logistics and Transportation Process
1. **Collect Goods**: Collecting goods from various sources (likely warehouses or suppliers).
2. **Load Truck**:
   - For Handling Units: After collecting goods, they are loaded onto the truck.
   - For Containers: Loaded onto trucks for transportation to the terminal.
3. **Drive to Terminal**: The truck drives to a designated terminal where containers and other goods are processed.
4. **Weigh**: Goods or containers may need to be weighed at the terminal.
5. **Place in Stock**: After weighing, some items might be stored temporarily in stock.

### Container Handling and Loading
- **Bring to Loading Bay**: Containers that need further handling are brought to a loading bay for processing or rescheduling.
- **Load to Vehicle**: Once in the loading bay, containers are loaded onto vehicles (likely trailers or ships).
- **Depart**: After all preparations, the vehicle departs for its destination.

### Rescheduling and Exception Handling
1. If there are issues or changes required:
   - **Reschedule Container**: Containers may need to be rescheduled if there is a delay or a change in requirements.
   - This step can happen at multiple stages: from weighing, loading, bringing to the loading bay, etc.

### Summary of Process Flow
The overall process involves registering customer orders and creating transport documents which then trigger vehicle booking. Empty containers are ordered as needed and loaded onto trucks for transportation to terminals where they might be weighed or stored temporarily. Containers are brought to loading bays for final preparations before being loaded onto vehicles that depart for their destinations.

Rescheduling can occur at various points due to unforeseen circumstances, ensuring flexibility in the logistics process.

This model of operations indicates a high level of integration between different logistical activities with multiple feedback loops and conditional steps depending on specific requirements or issues encountered during handling.
