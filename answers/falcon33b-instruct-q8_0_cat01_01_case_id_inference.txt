To solve this problem, we need to analyze the timestamps and activities to understand the flow of each case (patient journey). Since there's no explicit case ID provided, we will look for natural breakpoints in the sequences that indicate the start or end of a patient's treatment. We can group events into cases based on changes in department or activity type, along with significant time intervals between related activities.

**Case 1:**
- Starts: Patient registration (ER)
  - Event 1: Register patient
- Subsequent Activities: Triage (ER), Consultation (Surgery), X-ray imaging (Radiology), Lab test requested (ER), Surgery preparation (Surgery), Lab test completed (Laboratory), Doctor consultation (ER), Diagnosis (ER), Prescription created (ER), Discharge (ER)
  - End: Discharge (ER)

**Case 2:**
- Starts: Patient registration (ER)
  - Event 2: Register patient
- Subsequent Activities: Triage (ER), Doctor consultation (ER), Diagnosis (ER), Prescription created (ER), Discharge (ER)
  - End: Discharge (ER)

**Case 3:**
- Starts: Patient registration (ER)
  - Event 3: Register patient
- Subsequent Activities: Triage (ER), Doctor consultation (ER), Diagnosis (ER), Prescription created (ER), Discharge (ER)
  - End: Discharge (ER)

**Case 4:**
- Starts: Patient registration (ER)
  - Event 3: Register patient
- Subsequent Activities: Triage (ER), Consultation (Surgery), X-ray imaging (Radiology), Lab test requested (ER), Surgery preparation (Surgery), Lab test completed (Laboratory), Doctor consultation (ER), Diagnosis (ER), Prescription created (ER), Discharge (ER)
  - End: Discharge (ER)

**Note:** The cases are inferred based on the natural progression and grouping of events, considering changes in department and activity types. The initial registration event is critical for identifying the start of a new case, and subsequent events should logically align with this starting point.

Case groupings might not be absolute without additional context or explicit identifiers but follow logical sequencing and departmental transitions observed in the provided data.
