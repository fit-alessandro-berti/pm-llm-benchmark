# Scenario-specific constraints:

# 1. An order must be received before anything else happens with it.
#    - RO is the start, so it doesn't always come after something specific.
#    - Other activities must happen after RO. This can be expressed with 'always_after'
#      or 'directly_follows' for the very next steps.

# 2. Availability must be checked before items are reserved.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add(('RI', 'CA')) # If RI occurs, CA must have occurred previously.
log_skeleton['directly_follows'].add(('CA', 'RI')) # Often, check then immediately reserve.

# 3. Items must be picked after they are reserved.

# 5. Packing must occur before generating a shipping label.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add(('GSL', 'PO'))

# 6. Dispatch happens after the shipping label is generated.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add(('D', 'GSL'))

# 7. Invoice Customer can happen relatively independently but usually after order processing starts.
#    It cannot happen before the order is received.

# 9. An order must be received exactly once.

#     Generate Shipping Label, Dispatch must occur exactly once for a successful order.

#     or payment is handled externally/pre-paid. For this scenario, let's assume they occur once
#     for completed orders. If an order is cancelled, they might not occur.

# Additional logical constraints based on the process flow:

# - If an order is dispatched, it implies it was packed.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add(('D', 'PO'))

# - If an order is invoiced, it must have been received. (Already covered by IC,RO)

# - You can't Dispatch an order and also cancel it (assuming cancellation is an implicit state or activity not listed).
#   For listed activities, perhaps 'Dispatch' and 'Receive Order' are never together in a specific phase (less common).
#   For 'Never Together', consider activities that are mutually exclusive within the same case.
#   Example: If we had a 'Cancel Order' activity, then ('Dispatch', 'Cancel Order') would be in 'never_together'.
#   Without a 'Cancel Order' activity, we might not have strong 'never_together' pairs among these sequential steps.
#   However, a common application is that an item cannot be picked and simultaneously returned in the same 'case'
#   if 'return' was an activity. Here, all activities are part of the forward flow.

# Let's consider a scenario where 'Check Availability' and 'Pick Items' might not
# make sense to occur "never together" in a single atomic moment, but they are
# distinct steps. 'Never Together' usually implies truly alternative paths or
# contradictory states.
# For now, let's assume no explicit 'never_together' from the description.
# If a return process existed, then 'Dispatch' and 'Process Return' would be 'never_together'.

# Equivalence:
# If two activities always happen together (e.g., 'Generate Shipping Label' and 'Print Label' if 'Print Label' existed)
# For this scenario, assuming all listed activities are distinct steps.
# No obvious equivalence constraints from the description.

# Refine 'always_after' based on flow
# 'Receive Order' is the start. If RO occurs, then CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D must all occur later.
