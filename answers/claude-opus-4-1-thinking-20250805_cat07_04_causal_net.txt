This visualization appears to be a workflow or process diagram, likely a Petri net or similar business process model. 

The main diagram shows a process flow with the following components:

**Activities/Transitions (shown as rectangles with rounded corners):**
- Node 'a': "register request" (starting point)
- Node 'b': "examine thoroughly"
- Node 'c': "examine casually" 
- Node 'd': "check ticket"
- Node 'e': "decide"
- Node 'f': "reinitiate request"
- Node 'g': "pay compensation"
- Node 'h': "reject request"
- Node 'z': "end" (terminal point)

**Flow elements:**
- Black dots represent places or tokens in the workflow
- Directed edges (arrows) connect the activities through these places
- The workflow shows various paths from registration through examination, decision-making, and final outcomes

**Legend (bottom gray box):**
The box at the bottom shows six different control flow patterns:
- Top row: XOR-split, AND-split, OR-split
- Bottom row: XOR-join, AND-join, OR-join

These patterns illustrate how the workflow can branch (split) or merge (join) using different logical operators - exclusive OR (only one path), AND (all paths), or inclusive OR (one or more paths).

The diagram appears to model some kind of request or claim processing system where requests can be examined in different ways, decisions are made, and outcomes include paying compensation, rejecting the request, or reinitiating the process.
