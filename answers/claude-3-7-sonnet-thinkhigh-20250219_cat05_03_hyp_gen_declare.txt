# Analysis of Insurance Claim Process DECLARE Model Anomalies

## Identified Anomalies

1. **Contradictory Constraints**:
   - The `existence` constraint requires activity C (Close Claim) to occur in every process instance
   - The `noncoexistence` constraint states that activities E (Evaluate Claim) and C cannot both appear in the same instance
   - The `responded_existence` constraint specifies that if A (Assign Adjuster) appears, then E must also appear
   - These create an unresolvable logical conflict: if A occurs, E must occur; if E occurs, C cannot occur; yet C must always occur

2. **Process Flow Disruption**:
   - The intended flow (RAEPNC) cannot be completed due to the noncoexistence constraint between E and C
   - The model lacks constraints for activities P (Approve) and N (Notify), allowing critical steps to be skipped
   - No constraints ensure the proper sequence AEPN, permitting incorrect execution paths

## Hypotheses

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements**:
   - The modeler may have confused temporal noncoexistence (not occurring simultaneously) with absolute noncoexistence (not occurring in the same process instance)
   - The noncoexistence constraint might have been intended for a specific subset of claims but was incorrectly applied globally

2. **Inconsistent Policy Updates**:
   - The noncoexistence rule may reflect a later policy change that wasn't reconciled with existing constraints
   - Different stakeholders likely contributed constraints without cross-checking for consistency

3. **Data Quality and Mining Issues**:
   - The model may have been derived from incomplete or corrupted event logs
   - Process mining algorithms might have incorrectly inferred the noncoexistence relationship from limited data samples

4. **Expedited Processing Paths**:
   - The contradictory constraints might attempt to accommodate both standard and fast-track claims processing
   - Small or routine claims may bypass evaluation, while complex claims require it, creating model ambiguity

5. **Organizational Silos**:
   - Different departments (claims intake, adjusting, payment) might operate with conflicting understandings of the process
   - The model may reflect these organizational inconsistencies

## SQL Verification Approaches

1. **Identifying Claims Violating Noncoexistence Constraint**:
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
FROM claims c
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E'
    INTERSECT
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
);
```

2. **Finding Claims Closed Without Evaluation**:
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
FROM claims c
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
)
AND c.claim_id NOT IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E'
);
```

3. **Checking Assign-Evaluate Relationship**:
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
FROM claims c
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'A'
)
AND c.claim_id NOT IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E'
);
```

4. **Examining Process Paths by Claim Characteristics**:
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN claim_amount < 1000 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN claim_amount BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High' 
    END AS amount_category,
    claim_type,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN has_eval = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS evaluated_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN has_close = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS closed_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN has_eval = 1 AND has_close = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS eval_and_close
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_eval,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_close
    FROM claims c
    LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
    GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
) AS claim_activities
GROUP BY amount_category, claim_type
ORDER BY amount_category, claim_type;
```

5. **Analyzing Adjuster Involvement in Anomalous Claims**:
```sql
SELECT 
    a.adjuster_id, a.name, a.specialization, a.region,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ce.claim_id) AS handled_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN anom.is_anomalous = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS anomalous_claims
FROM adjusters a
JOIN claim_events ce ON a.adjuster_id::varchar = ce.resource
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        c.claim_id,
        CASE WHEN c.claim_id IN (
            SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E'
            INTERSECT
            SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
        ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_anomalous
    FROM claims c
) AS anom ON ce.claim_id = anom.claim_id
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name, a.specialization, a.region
ORDER BY anomalous_claims DESC;
```

6. **Tracking Full Process Adherence**:
```sql
WITH expected_flow AS (
    SELECT claim_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 AS has_receive,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 AS has_assign,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 AS has_evaluate,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 AS has_approve,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 AS has_notify,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 AS has_close
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ef.has_receive AND ef.has_assign AND ef.has_evaluate 
        AND ef.has_approve AND ef.has_notify AND ef.has_close 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS full_flow_claims,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ef.has_receive AND ef.has_assign AND ef.has_evaluate 
        AND ef.has_approve AND ef.has_notify AND ef.has_close 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::NUMERIC / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS compliance_percentage
FROM claims c
JOIN expected_flow ef ON c.claim_id = ef.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_type;
```
