### Anomalies in the DECLARE Model

- Claims can transition directly from "Receive" (R) to "Close" (C), skipping the mandatory "Evaluate" (E) and "Approve" (P) steps.  
- An activity "E" can coexist with "C" in the `responded_existence` rule, allowing approval to log after closure, which risks re-opening or audit inconsistencies.  
- The "precedence" rule requires an "Evaluate" step only after "Receive", but no explicit constraint blocks "Close" without prior evaluation or approval in the declared logic—unless activity sequence violates intended boutiques.  
- Multiple pathways allow end-to-end workflows bypassing "Assign" (A) or "Evaluate" (E), undermining training ownership and audit trail integrity.  
- The "noncoexistence" rule forbids an evaluation “C” activity, but the internal constraints do not enforce that only one “E” activity precedes “C”, creating ambiguity in workflow enforcement.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

- The model likely originated from an evolving set of workflows where new approvals were introduced without updating enforcement rules, leading to conflicting logical paths.  
- Business stakeholders may have relaxed the workflow model due to performance pressure, allowing shortcuts where evaluation and approval are decoupled.  
- The DECLARE structure uses activity flags loosely, permitting inconsistent transitions that the schema fails to reveal without temporal tracing.  
- A developer or designer may have inadvertently imported redundant or overlapping constraints from older logic, resulting in noncoexistent or skipped steps.

### Verification Through SQL Queries

1. Find claims closed without an evaluation:  
```sql
SELECT claim_id, claim_type, submission_date, claim_amount
FROM claims
WHERE claim_id IN (SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C' AND timestamp < (SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id));
```

2. Identify claims with evaluation and closure done simultaneously (violating sequence):  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, e.timestamp AS evaluate_time, c.timestamp AS close_time
FROM claim_events c
JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND c.activity = 'C' AND c.timestamp < e.timestamp;
```

3. Verify that every `E` activity is linked to exactly one `A` activity via `resource` in `claim_events`:  
```sql
SELECT 
    e.event_id, e.claim_id,
    a.adjuster_id, a.name
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events a ON e.claim_id = a.claim_id
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM claim_events e2 
    WHERE e2.claim_id = e.claim_id 
    AND e2.resource = 'A' 
    AND e2.activity = 'A'
);
```

4. Confirm that `C` cannot precede `E` unless governed by activity sequence rule enforcement; check for rogue `C` without historical `E`:  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.activity, e.timestamp AS evaluate_time
FROM claim_events c
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
WHERE c.activity = 'C' AND NOT EXISTS (e WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E');
```

These queries help validate rule consistency, detect workflow violations, and trace actual claim paths against intended design.
