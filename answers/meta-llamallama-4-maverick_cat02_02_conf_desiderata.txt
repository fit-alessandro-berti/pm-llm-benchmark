## Step 1: Analyze the given event log for Case 1
Case 1 follows the sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. This adheres to the strict normative rules. The activities are in the correct order, and there are no skipped steps or contradictory actions.

## Step 2: Analyze the given event log for Case 2
Case 2 has the sequence: Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. This violates the normative rules because Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check, which is not allowed. Additionally, Finalize Documentation is performed after a Loan Decision of Rejected, which is also not allowed.

## Step 3: Analyze the given event log for Case 3
Case 3 follows the normative sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. Thus, it adheres to the strict rules.

## Step 4: Check Case 1 against the desiderata
For Case 1, the Credit Check is done within 30 minutes, and Inform Applicant is done within 2 hours of the Loan Decision. Both are within the recommended timeframes (Credit Check within 24 hours, Inform Applicant within 48 hours). There's no Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum.

## Step 5: Check Case 2 against the desiderata
Case 2 violates normative rules, so desiderata are not relevant for compliance. However, it's worth noting that even if it hadn't violated normative rules, the sequence and timing would still be an issue.

## Step 6: Check Case 3 against the desiderata
For Case 3, the Credit Check is done more than 24 hours after Application Received, and Inform Applicant is done more than 48 hours after Loan Decision. Both are violations of the desiderata. Additionally, there's no Follow-up Call, which is also a desideratum violation.

## Step 7: Summarize violations for each case
- Case 1: Violates desiderata by not having a Follow-up Call.
- Case 2: Violates normative rules by doing Risk Assessment before Credit Check and by Finalizing Documentation after a rejection.
- Case 3: Violates desiderata by having a delayed Credit Check, delayed Inform Applicant, and no Follow-up Call.

## Step 8: Provide interpretations or justifications for observed behaviors
For Case 2, the violations are significant and indicate a process failure. For Case 3, while the desiderata violations indicate suboptimal behavior, they do not indicate a failure in the process sequence. The lack of a Follow-up Call in Cases 1 and 3 is a missed opportunity for additional customer service.

## Step 9: Conclude on the violations and desiderata for all cases
Case 2 has significant normative violations. Cases 1 and 3 have desiderata violations.

The final answer is: 
**Case 2** violates the normative rules. 
**Cases 1 and 3** fail to meet the desiderata.
