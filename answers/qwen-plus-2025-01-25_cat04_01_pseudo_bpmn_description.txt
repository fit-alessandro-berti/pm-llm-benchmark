### Detailed Explanation of the Business Process

The pseudo-BPMN representation describes a business process for handling customer requests, which can be either **standard** or **custom**. The process includes validation, feasibility analysis, parallel checks, approval workflows, and final invoice generation. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

---

#### **1. Start Event**
- **Purpose**: Initiates the process when a customer request is received.
- This is the starting point where the system or team begins processing the request.

---

#### **2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose**: Captures the initial details of the customer's request.
- This task ensures that all necessary information is collected to determine the type of request (standard or custom).

---

#### **3. Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
- **Purpose**: Determines whether the request is **Standard** or **Custom**.
- **Behavior**: An XOR gateway splits the process into two mutually exclusive paths:
  - If the request is **Standard**, the process moves to **Task B1**.
  - If the request is **Custom**, the process moves to **Task B2**.

---

#### **Path 1: Standard Request**

##### **3.1 Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- **Purpose**: Validates the standard request against predefined criteria.
- Ensures the request meets basic requirements before proceeding further.

##### **3.2 Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
- **Purpose**: Initiates two independent checks that must both complete before moving forward.
- **Behavior**: An AND gateway splits the process into two parallel paths:
  - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**: Verifies the customer's creditworthiness.
  - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**: Confirms the availability of required items in inventory.

##### **3.3 All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
- **Purpose**: Waits for both parallel tasks (C1 and C2) to finish.
- Once both checks are completed, the process proceeds to the next step.

##### **3.4 Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- **Purpose**: Determines the expected delivery date based on the results of the parallel checks.

---

#### **Path 2: Custom Request**

##### **3.5 Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- **Purpose**: Evaluates whether the customization requested by the customer is feasible.
- This involves assessing technical, logistical, and financial constraints.

##### **3.6 Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- **Purpose**: Decides whether the customization is possible.
- **Behavior**:
  - If **Yes**, proceed to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**.
  - If **No**, proceed to **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"** and end the process.

##### **3.7 Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- **Purpose**: Creates a detailed quotation for the custom request, including costs and timelines.

---

#### **4. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Purpose**: Determines whether managerial approval is required for the request.
- **Behavior**:
  - If **Yes**, proceed to **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**.
  - If **No**, skip directly to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**.

---

#### **Approval Workflow**

##### **4.1 Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- **Purpose**: Submits the request to a manager for review and approval.
- After the manager reviews the request, the process moves to another XOR gateway.

##### **4.2 Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the outcome of the manager's decision.
- **Behavior**:
  - If **Yes**, proceed to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**.
  - If **No**, loop back to rework:
    - For **Custom Requests**, return to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**.
    - For **Standard Requests**, return to **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**.

---

#### **5. Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
- **Purpose**: Creates the final invoice for the customer after all validations and approvals are complete.

---

#### **6. Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose**: Communicates the final confirmation (including delivery date and invoice details) to the customer.
- This is the last operational step before the process ends.

---

#### **7. End Event**
- **Purpose**: Marks the completion of the process.

### Key Features of the Process

1. **Request Type Differentiation**:
   - The process branches early based on whether the request is **Standard** or **Custom**.
   - Standard requests follow a simpler path with predefined validations and checks.
   - Custom requests involve additional steps like feasibility analysis and potentially rejection if customization is not feasible.

2. **Parallel Processing**:
   - For standard requests, credit and inventory checks run simultaneously using an AND gateway, improving efficiency.

3. **Approval Workflow**:
   - Some requests require managerial approval, introducing an additional layer of control.
   - If approval is denied, the process loops back for rework, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

4. **Rejection Handling**:
   - If a custom request is deemed infeasible, the process terminates gracefully with a rejection notice.

5. **Convergence**:
   - Both standard and custom paths eventually converge at the approval gateway, ensuring a unified flow toward generating the final invoice and confirming the order.

### Summary of Conditions Triggering Loops or Rework

- **Approval Not Granted**: Triggers a loop back to rework:
  - For **Custom Requests**, revisit **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**.
  - For **Standard Requests**, revisit **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**.

- **Customization Infeasible**: Ends the process immediately with a rejection notice.

This structured approach ensures that all customer requests are handled systematically, with appropriate checks, approvals, and feedback loops to address complexities or issues that may arise.
