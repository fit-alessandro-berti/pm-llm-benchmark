Here's an example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Create PO')},
    'always_before': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Approve Purchase Order'), 
                      ('Approve Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier')},
    'always_after': {('Send Purchase Order to Supplier', 'Receive Goods')},
    'never_together': {('Cancel Purchase Order', 'Approve Purchase Order')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {1},
        'Approve Purchase Order': {0, 1},
        'Send Purchase Order to Supplier': {1},
        'Receive Goods': {1},
        'Cancel Purchase Order': {0, 1},
        'Pay Invoice': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {('Approve Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier'),
                         ('Send Purchase Order to Supplier', 'Receive Goods'),
                         ('Receive Goods', 'Pay Invoice')}
}
```

In this example:

*   The 'equivalence' constraint states that 'Create Purchase Order' and 'Create PO' are the same activity.
*   The 'always_before' constraint states that 'Create Purchase Order' must occur before 'Approve Purchase Order', and 'Approve Purchase Order' must occur before 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier'.
*   The 'always_after' constraint states that 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier' must occur before 'Receive Goods'.
*   The 'never_together' constraint states that 'Cancel Purchase Order' and 'Approve Purchase Order' cannot co-exist in the same case.
*   The 'activ_freq' constraint states that:
    *   'Create Purchase Order' and 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier' must occur exactly once.
    *   'Approve Purchase Order' and 'Cancel Purchase Order' can occur zero or one time.
    *   'Receive Goods' and 'Pay Invoice' must occur exactly once.
*   The 'directly_follows' constraint states that:
    *   'Approve Purchase Order' must be followed directly by 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier'.
    *   'Send Purchase Order to Supplier' must be followed directly by 'Receive Goods'.
    *   'Receive Goods' must be followed directly by 'Pay Invoice'.

This Log Skeleton model represents a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process, where a purchase order is created, approved, sent to the supplier, goods are received, and the invoice is paid. The model also allows for the cancellation of the purchase order, but this cannot happen if the order has already been approved.
