**Integrated Event Log**  
*Order#1234 | Sorted by Primary Timestamp (Log A)*

---

### **1. Order Received (Merged)**  
**Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z (Log A)  
**Source**: Log A & Log B  
**Attributes**:  
- `event_type`: "Order Received" (Log A)  
- `event_name`: "OrderReceived" (Log B)  
- `user_id`: "u45" (Log B)  
- `resource_id`: "r10" (Log B)  
- `notes`: "Event captured at warehouse system" (Log B)  
- `optional_timestamp`: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z (Log B, within 2s tolerance)  

**Reasoning**:  
- Timestamps differ by 2 seconds (within tolerance).  
- Merged despite minor naming differences (capitalization and word order).  
- Log A's timestamp prioritized (primary system), but Log B's timestamp included for transparency.  

---

### **2. Order Validated (Merged)**  
**Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z (Log A)  
**Source**: Log A & Log B  
**Attributes**:  
- `event_type`: "Order Validated" (Log A)  
- `event_name`: "OrderValidation" (Log B)  
- `user_id`: "u12" (Log B)  
- `resource_id`: "r10" (Log B)  
- `notes`: "Cross-check inventory" (Log B)  
- `optional_timestamp`: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z (Log B, within 2s tolerance)  

**Reasoning**:  
- Events aligned with 1-second timestamp difference.  
- Log B's term "Validation" corresponds to Log A's "Validated".  
- Metadata (inventory checks) added from Log B.  

---

### **3. Payment Processed (Log A Only)**  
**Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z  
**Source**: Log A  
**Attributes**:  
- `event_type`: "Payment Processed"  

**Reasoning**:  
- Log B's "PaymentCheck" at 10:02:05Z differed by 5 seconds (exceeding tolerance).  
- Likely sequential steps (Log A’s "Processed" = action taken; Log B’s "Checked" = internal verification).  
- Left separate to avoid conflating distinct workflows.  

---

### **4. PaymentCheck (Log B Only)**  
**Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z  
**Source**: Log B  
**Attributes**:  
- `event_name`: "PaymentCheck"  
- `user_id`: "u12"  
- `resource_id`: "r99"  
- `notes`: "Payment gateway delay"  

**Reasoning**:  
- No Log A counterpart due to timestamp mismatch and naming variance.  
- Retained to reflect the payment verification step unique to System B.  

---

### **5. Quality Check (Log B Only)**  
**Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z  
**Source**: Log B  
**Attributes**:  
- `event_name`: "Quality Check"  
- `user_id`: "u45"  
- `resource_id`: "r11"  
- `notes`: "Random inspection"  

**Reasoning**:  
- No equivalent in Log A.  
- Included as an additional control step in System B’s process.  

---

### **6. Item Shipped (Merged)**  
**Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z (Log A)  
**Source**: Log A & Log B  
**Attributes**:  
- `event_type`: "Item Shipped" (Log A)  
- `event_name`: "Shipping" (Log B)  
- `user_id`: "u45" (Log B)  
- `resource_id`: "r10" (Log B)  
- `notes`: "Package handed to courier" (Log B)  
- `optional_timestamp`: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z (Log B, within 2s tolerance)  

**Reasoning**:  
- Timestamps aligned within 2 seconds.  
- Log B’s logistical details (courier handoff) added to Log A’s event.  

---

### **7. Item Delivered (Log A Only)**  
**Timestamp**: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z  
**Source**: Log A  
**Attributes**:  
- `event_type`: "Item Delivered"  

**Reasoning**:  
- No corresponding event in Log B.  
- Final step in Log A’s process, retained as-is.  

---

### **Key Decisions**  
1. **Timestamp Tolerance**:  
   - Merged events within **2 seconds** of each other (e.g., Order Received, Order Validated, Item Shipped).  
   - Larger gaps (e.g., 5 seconds for Payment Processed/PaymentCheck) treated as distinct.  

2. **Naming Standardization**:  
   - Prefixed merged events with Log A’s terminology (e.g., “Validated” vs. Log B’s “Validation”).  
   - Retained Log B’s original event names as separate attributes (e.g., `event_name` field).  

3. **Conflict Resolution**:  
   - Log A’s timestamps prioritized as the “primary” timeline.  
   - Log B’s timestamps marked as `optional_timestamp` for merged events.  

4. **Unique Events**:  
   - Log B’s **Quality Check** and **PaymentCheck** included separately to preserve System B’s internal logic.  
   - Log A’s **Payment Processed** retained to reflect its distinct workflow step (e.g., gateway vs. administrative tasks).  

5. **Metadata Integration**:  
   - Added user_id, resource_id, and notes from Log B to merged events where applicable.  

---

### **Chronological Flow**  
1. **Order Received**  
2. **Order Validated**  
3. **Payment Processed** (Log A)  **PaymentCheck** (Log B)  **Quality Check** (Log B)  
4. **Item Shipped**  
5. **Item Delivered**  

*Note*: While timestamps order events sequentially, the sequence suggests:  
- System B’s **PaymentCheck** and **Quality Check** likely occur during/after System A’s **Payment Processed**, reflecting asynchronicity between systems.  
- No further merging possible due to naming/timing constraints.  

This integrated log now captures both systems’ workflows while preserving traceability to their source data.
