The diagram is a Sankey diagram that visualizes the flow of data over time, specifically the progression of fines from issuance to collection. The overall structure consists of three main horizontal bands labeled 'Send Fine,' 'Insert Fine Notification,' and 'Send for Credit Collection,' which represent different stages in the process. Vertical lines within the 'Send Fine' band indicate the issuance of fines over time, while the lines flowing into the 'Insert Fine Notification' band show the subsequent notifications issued. Finally, the lines extending to the 'Send for Credit Collection' band illustrate the progression of fines to the credit collection stage. The red lines within the diagram highlight specific paths of fines that have been sent for credit collection, emphasizing the flow and transformation of data through these stages. The diagram effectively conveys the temporal progression and transformation of fines from issuance to collection, highlighting the key stages and transitions involved in the process.
