Below is a practical, data-driven plan to mine TechSolve’s event log, diagnose the root causes of resource-assignment inefficiencies, and implement and monitor better assignment strategies.

1) Analyze resource behavior and assignment patterns

A. Prepare and enrich the event log
- Normalize timestamps and time zones. Use START/COMPLETE semantics to derive:
  - Queue time before work at each tier: Assign X  Work X Start
  - Active service time: Work X Start  Work X End
  - Escalation delay: Escalate X  Assign X+1
  - Reassignment delay: Reassign  next Work Start
- Add agent calendars (shift schedules, PTO) to calculate true availability and utilization.
- Standardize attributes: Priority, Category, Required Skill, Channel; map Agent Skills to a structured skill matrix including proficiency levels (e.g., 1–3).
- Derive case-level features: number of reassignments, number of escalations, handover count, variant ID, reopen count, SLA slack (remaining time to deadline), first-touch time, and total lead time.

B. Metrics at agent, team, skill, and tier levels
- Workload and utilization
  - Tickets handled and active hours per agent/tier/skill per week.
  - Utilization per agent: active service time / staffed time.
  - Workload inequality: Gini or Theil index across agents to quantify uneven distribution.
- Efficiency and timeliness
  - Time to Assign and Time to First Touch by tier and priority.
  - Queue time vs active time share per tier/skill.
  - Throughput time per priority and category.
- Quality of assignment and handling
  - First-call resolution (FCR) at L1: fraction of tickets resolved without escalation.
  - Escalation rate from L1 and from L2; average number of handovers and reassignments per case.
  - Assignment quality index (AQI): credit 1.0 for no escalation/reassign within 2 hours, 0.5 for one escalation, 0 for more; track by dispatcher and by channel.
  - Skill alignment score: fraction of work steps performed by agents whose skills match Required Skill at or above needed proficiency.
  - Overqualification index: share of L2/L3 active time spent on tickets whose Required Skill could be handled by L1 (per historical evidence).
- SLA impact
  - SLA hit rate by priority, category, skill, tier.
  - SLA breach odds vs drivers (e.g., reassignments, queue time at L2, channel) using logistic regression or survival analysis.

C. Process mining and organizational mining techniques
- Handover-of-work social network
  - Nodes as agents or teams; edges indicate handovers (Work End of resource A  next Work Start of resource B).
  - Weight edges by frequency and total inter-handover delay to highlight slow and frequent handover pairs and “ping-pong” patterns.
- Role discovery and resource clustering
  - Cluster agents by activity profiles and skills to detect actual roles/specializations vs documented ones. Reveal hidden sub-roles (e.g., “L2 network-firewall triage”).
- Conformance checking against intended routing policy
  - Model the intended flow (e.g., L1 triage, escalate based on required skill) in BPMN/Petri nets with resource constraints.
  - Measure deviations: unexpected self-assign, cross-tier jumps without proper escalation, loops, or reassignments across unrelated skills.
- Variant analysis of case flows
  - Identify dominant “happy path” variants (e.g., L1 resolve) versus “churn” variants (multiple reassignments/escalations), then compare metrics and attributes.

D. Skill utilization analysis
- Compute demand vs capacity per skill per time-of-day/day-of-week. For each skill:
  - Demand: arrivals requiring skill (or predicted to require it) and total active hours spent on that skill.
  - Capacity: number of agents with that skill by shift and proficiency; effective capacity = availability × proficiency weight.
- Identify skills under pressure (high queue time, high SLA breach, high utilization) and skills underused (low utilization).
- Overqualification detection: proportion of specialist hours spent on tickets tagged Basic or historically resolved by L1; quantify “shift-left potential.”

2) Identify resource-related bottlenecks and issues

Use the metrics and process views to pinpoint issues and quantify their impact:
- Skill bottlenecks and queues
  - “Skill pressure index” per skill = average queue time until first skilled touch / SLA window. High values flag shortages (e.g., Networking-Firewall Monday mornings).
  - Measure utilization distributions; persistent >85–90% utilization correlates with queue growth and SLA risk.
- Reassignment and escalation delays
  - Average delay per reassignment = time from Reassign to next Work Start. Report median and 90th percentile; quantify added lead time per reassignment (e.g., +2.6 hours median).
  - Identify “ping-pong” handoffs (ABA or tier bounce L2L2'). Quantify fraction of cases with 2 reassignments and associated SLA breach rate.
- Incorrect initial assignment
  - For tickets that were reassigned within 2 hours of L1 start or L2 start, infer mis-triage. Quantify proportion and added delay.
  - Dispatcher quality: AQI split by dispatcher and by channel; rank and trend.
- Overloaded/underperforming agents/teams
  - Agents with utilization >90% and rising WIP: likely bottlenecks. Agents with high average queue time for assigned tickets or long active service times vs peers: coaching or process issues.
  - Underutilized resources (e.g., <40–50%): rebalancing opportunity.
- Correlation to SLA breaches
  - Logistic regression or survival analysis:
    - Predictors: number of reassignments, L2 queue time, Required Skill, category, channel, time of day, agent proficiency, initial triage accuracy.
    - Output: odds ratios (e.g., every additional reassignment increases breach odds by 1.8×; L2 queue time per hour increases breach odds by 1.3×). Use SHAP to communicate feature influence.

3) Root-cause analysis for assignment inefficiencies

Likely root causes, validated with data patterns:
- Round-robin and self-assignment ignoring skills/workload
  - Evidence: high misalignment rate, frequent L2 reassignments across skills; handover networks showing broad, inefficient cross-skill transfers.
- Inaccurate/incomplete skill profiles
  - Evidence: role discovery showing agents performing skills not in their profiles; frequent reassignments to specific specialists after initial misroutes.
- Poor initial ticket categorization/skill estimation
  - Evidence: high rate of Required Skill change after L1 triage; channel-specific misclassification (e.g., phone tickets).
  - Decision mining: derive rules from historical “Escalate vs Resolve at L1” decisions; find features (category, keywords, device type) tied to escalation.
- Lack of real-time workload/availability visibility
  - Evidence: reassignments to equally overloaded agents; long AssignWork Start gaps in peak hours while other skilled agents are idle.
- Insufficient L1 enablement (shift-left gaps)
  - Evidence: top 20 recurring L2 patterns with high repeatability and short service times—candidates for L1 resolution with proper SOPs/tools.
- Process design issues
  - Conformance deviations such as bypassing triage or excessive manual reassignments without reason codes; “ping-pong” without clear exit criteria.

Use variant analysis to compare smooth cases (few or no reassignments) vs churn cases:
- Contrast attributes present at ticket creation: category, keywords, channel, time, priority.
- Contrast L1 handling: was a diagnostic checklist completed, was a knowledge article used, was the same skill used in the final resolution that could have been applied upfront?
- Decision trees highlight patterns leading to poor outcomes (e.g., “if Category=Network and keywords include ‘VPN’ and L1 agent lacks Networking-Firewall proficiency, escalation likelihood >80%”).

4) Data-driven resource assignment strategies

Strategy 1: Skill-, proficiency-, and workload-aware routing with SLA risk weighting
- Problem addressed: Misassignment, uneven workloads, specialists doing basic work, and SLA breaches due to late first touch.
- How it uses mining insights:
  - Targets skills with high pressure indices; considers proficiency; balances load based on current WIP and queue times; prioritizes tickets by SLA slack.
- Approach
  - For each new or escalated ticket, compute a score per eligible agent:
    - score =  skill_fit +  proficiency +  availability_buffer +  negative_utilization +  SLA_risk +  historical_performance_on_category
    - skill_fit: 1 if required skill in agent profile; partial credit for adjacent skills learned from handover patterns and success data.
    - SLA_risk: lower slack  higher score weight.
    - availability_buffer: predicted start time based on agent’s current queue (from log-derived service-time distributions).
  - Use push assignment for P1/P2; controlled pull for P3/P4 from a virtualized queue per skill.
  - Shield L2/L3: only route to them when skill_fit at L1 is low and predicted success at L1 is low.
- Data required: Accurate skill matrix with proficiency, agent calendars, real-time WIP and queues, SLA per priority, historical service-time distributions by skill/category.
- Expected benefits: Fewer reassignments, faster first touch, better SLA adherence; specialists focus on specialist work; workload equalization.

Strategy 2: Predictive triage to determine required skill and complexity at ticket creation
- Problem addressed: Incorrect initial categorization and late discovery of required skill.
- How it uses mining insights:
  - Trains on historical cases: map ticket metadata and text to final skill used, escalation probability, and expected handle time.
- Approach
  - ML/NLP classifier:
    - Inputs: category, subcategory, channel, asset, requester segment, short/long description keywords/embeddings, time-of-day.
    - Outputs: predicted required skill(s), escalation likelihood from L1, predicted handle time bucket.
  - Use prediction confidence thresholds:
    - High confidence: auto-route via Strategy 1 to the best agent pool.
    - Medium: recommend top-3 skills and preferred tier to dispatcher.
    - Low: flag for senior triage.
- Data required: Full text fields, final skill actually used in resolution (from log and/or knowledge tags), agent performance by category.
- Expected benefits: Higher L1 FCR where appropriate, reduced unnecessary escalations, faster correct assignment, lower rework.

Strategy 3: Reassignment guardrails with decision support
- Problem addressed: Churn from unnecessary reassignments and “ping-pong” patterns.
- How it uses mining insights:
  - Identifies handover pairs that often lead to delays; quantifies average delay per reassignment; learns “best next destination” for specific patterns.
- Approach
  - Guardrails:
    - Require reason code for reassign with auto-suggested Smart Destinations (top-3 agents/teams by success and speed for this ticket profile).
    - “Two-touch rule”: if a ticket leaves a skill group twice without progress, route to a senior triage queue.
    - Cool-down windows: prevent quick back-and-forth reassignments to the same agent/team.
  - UX support:
    - Inline recommendation panel showing predicted success probability and ETA if reassigned to suggested targets vs current agent.
- Data required: Historical handover outcomes, reassignment reasons, performance by agent/skill on similar tickets.
- Expected benefits: Reduced reassign count and delay, improved SLA rates, fewer ping-pong loops.

Strategy 4: Targeted shift-left enablement and SOP enforcement
- Problem addressed: Specialists handling work suitable for L1; low L1 FCR.
- How it uses mining insights:
  - Identifies top L2/L3 patterns frequently repeated with short service times and high success rates that can be standardized into L1 runbooks.
- Approach
  - Create/curate knowledge articles and guided diagnostics for those patterns; instrument forms to require SOP steps before escalation.
  - Dynamic eligibility: as L1 proficiency and success rates improve, expand scope.
- Data required: Pattern mining of L2/L3 resolutions; knowledge usage logs; L1 performance trends.
- Expected benefits: Higher L1 FCR, reduced L2/L3 load, faster resolution for P2/P3.

Strategy 5: Dynamic capacity shaping and queue virtualization by skill
- Problem addressed: Temporal demand spikes and uneven utilization across agents with overlapping skills.
- How it uses mining insights:
  - Uses time-of-day/week arrival and queue-time patterns per skill to forecast short-term load; identifies cross-skilled agents as flex capacity.
- Approach
  - Virtual skill queues spanning tiers; allow cross-skill routing where adjacent skills are proven effective.
  - Short-term rebalancing: temporarily move cross-skilled agents to high-pressure queues; auto-suggest “help needed” announcements.
  - Sequencing rule per agent: schedule next ticket by earliest SLA due date with expected-shortest-processing-time tie-breakers (EDD+WSPT).
- Data required: Arrival forecasts per skill/priority, agent cross-skill map, service time distributions, calendars.
- Expected benefits: Reduced peaks in queue times, better SLA performance in surges, improved agent load balance.

5) Simulation, implementation, and monitoring

A. Business process simulation to validate strategies before rollout
- Build a discrete-event simulation calibrated from the mined log:
  - Arrivals: non-homogeneous rates by hour/day, split by priority, category, and predicted skill.
  - Resources: agents with calendars, skills, and proficiency; service-time distributions per (skill, priority, category) from start/end stamps.
  - Policies: baseline (current round-robin/manual) vs scenarios (Strategies 1–5). Include queue disciplines (SLA-aware EDD), guardrails, and dynamic capacity rules.
  - Reassignments: model based on learned probabilities conditional on initial assignment and ticket features; reduce per rules in new scenarios.
- Validate the baseline simulation by comparing to historical KPIs (SLA rates, average lead times, queue times, reassign counts).
- Run multiple replications and sensitivity analyses (e.g., +15% arrivals, -10% staff availability, skew toward Network incidents).
- Compare scenarios on:
  - SLA compliance by priority
  - Lead time distributions
  - Reassign and escalation counts
  - Specialist time spent on basic tasks
  - Agent utilization variance
- Select the best-performing policy mix; refine parameters (weights …, guardrail thresholds).

B. Implementation roadmap
- Phase 0: Data foundations
  - Clean event log pipeline; standardize Required Skill coding; enrich with calendars and a living skill matrix (owner: team leads).
- Phase 1: Insights-to-ops
  - Deploy dashboards; pilot predictive triage for 1–2 categories; shadow-mode routing scores while keeping current dispatch to establish baselines.
- Phase 2: Controlled pilots
  - A/B test skill- and SLA-aware routing in selected queues; enable reassignment guardrails and Smart Destinations; launch 2–3 shift-left runbooks.
- Phase 3: Scale-up
  - Expand to all categories; institutionalize quarterly skill-matrix reviews; integrate forecasts for dynamic capacity shaping.

C. Monitoring with process mining dashboards (near-real-time and weekly)
- Real-time/operational KPIs
  - Backlog and queue time by skill, tier, and priority; predicted SLA breaches next 4 hours.
  - Time to First Touch; AssignStart lag by tier and dispatcher.
  - Reassignments today and 7-day trend; ping-pong alerts.
  - L1 FCR and escalation rates by category/channel.
  - Utilization heatmap by agent and skill; workload inequality (Gini index).
  - Conformance alerts: unexpected jumps/loops; reassignment without reason code.
- Weekly/monthly analytical KPIs
  - SLA attainment by priority/category; lead time percentiles.
  - Skill alignment and overqualification indices; specialist time on basic tasks.
  - Dispatcher assignment quality index (AQI); top mis-triage patterns and keyword drift.
  - Effect of guardrails: average delay per reassignment and reassign count trend.
  - Shift-left impact: volume moved to L1, success rate, and SLA improvement.
  - Forecast accuracy: predicted vs actual required skill; calibration curves.
- Governance
  - Action thresholds and playbooks (e.g., if Networking-Firewall backlog > X for Y minutes, trigger flex reallocation).
  - Quarterly reviews to update skill matrix, routing weights, and triage models; use drift detection on text to update NLP models.

Notes on data and ethics
- Use team-level views for performance to avoid individual blame; individual coaching should be supportive and context-aware.
- Capture and standardize reassignment reasons; they are essential for learning and improvement.
- Keep models transparent; expose top features influencing routing recommendations.

By following this plan, TechSolve will quantify where and why assignments go wrong, simulate and select better routing and sequencing rules, and continuously monitor the impact. The combined effect should be fewer reassignments, improved SLA adherence for P2/P3, and better use of specialist capacity—measured, validated, and sustained through process mining.
