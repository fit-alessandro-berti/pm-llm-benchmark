### Explanation

**Case Identification:**
- **C1:** **Quarterly_Report.docx**  
  Represents the editing session for the quarterly report document.
  
- **C2:** **Document1.docx**  
  Represents the editing activities for a secondary document.
  
- **C3:** **Email - Inbox**  
  Captures the process of handling an email, including replying and sending.
  
- **C4:** **Report_Draft.pdf**  
  Represents the reviewing and highlighting activities on a PDF report.
  
- **C5:** **Budget_2024.xlsx**  
  Encompasses the tasks related to updating the budget spreadsheet.

**Activity Naming:**
- **Open Application:** Triggered by **FOCUS** actions when a user brings an application or document into focus.
- **Edit Content:** Derived from **TYPING** actions, representing the modification or creation of content within a document or email.
- **Save Content:** Corresponds to **SAVE** actions, indicating that changes are being saved.
- **Switch Application:** From **SWITCH** actions, denoting the user moving from one application or document to another.
- **Click Action:** Based on **CLICK** actions, representing interactions like opening or replying to emails.
- **Scroll Content:** From **SCROLL** actions, indicating navigation within a document or webpage.
- **Highlight Text:** Derived from **HIGHLIGHT** actions, representing the selection or marking of specific text within a PDF.
- **Close Application:** Corresponds to **CLOSE** actions, indicating the termination of work on a document or application.

**Logic Behind Grouping and Naming:**
- **Grouping into Cases:** Events were grouped into cases based on the specific application and document/window being interacted with. Each case represents a distinct unit of work, such as editing a document, handling an email, reviewing a PDF, or updating a spreadsheet.
  
- **Standardizing Activity Names:** Raw system actions (e.g., FOCUS, TYPING) were mapped to higher-level, standardized activity names to facilitate coherent analysis. This abstraction ensures that the event log is analyst-friendly and suitable for standard process mining tools.

- **Temporal and Contextual Considerations:** The sequence and timing of events were used to infer the flow of activities within each case, ensuring that the narrative of user work sessions is logical and coherent.

This structured event log provides a clear and analyzable representation of user activities, enabling effective process mining and analysis.
