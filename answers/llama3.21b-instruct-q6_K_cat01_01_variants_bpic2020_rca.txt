Based on the provided process variants, I've identified some root causes for the performance issues:

1. **Low frequency of Payment Handled**: Most processes have low frequencies (e.g., 4618, 2473, 1392, 345, and 77) that can lead to delays in payment handling. This may be due to a lack of automation or manual intervention.
2. **High number of Rejections**: Many processes (e.g., 174, 188, 21, 18, 14, 11, 10, 8, and 7) have high frequencies of rejections, which can significantly impact the overall performance of the process.
3. **Lack of Automation**: The presence of manual steps in some processes (e.g., 40 for "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE ->") may lead to delays and increased processing time.
4. **Insufficient approvals**: Processes that require multiple approvals (e.g., 2473, 575, and 345) can slow down the overall process due to the need for manual approval checks.
5. **Inadequate data validation**: Some processes (e.g., 174, 188, and 40) have low performance due to inadequate data validation, which may lead to incorrect or incomplete data being used in subsequent steps.
6. **Insufficient error handling**: Processes that don't handle errors properly (e.g., 31, 36, and 49) can result in unexpected rejections and delays.
7. **Inefficient use of PRE_APPROVER**: The presence of too many processes with the "REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER" variant (e.g., 8) may lead to delays and inefficiencies due to the need for multiple approvals.
8. **Limited feedback loops**: Processes that don't have effective feedback loops (e.g., 7, 10, and 16) can result in incomplete or inaccurate data being used in subsequent steps.

To address these root causes, consider the following strategies:

1. Implement automation and minimize manual intervention.
2. Increase frequency of Payment Handled processes to reduce delays.
3. Optimize Rejection handling by streamlining approval checks and reducing the number of rejections.
4. Enhance data validation to ensure accuracy and completeness.
5. Improve error handling mechanisms to prevent unexpected rejections and delays.
6. Integrate PRE_APPROVER with other approvals to simplify the process.
7. Establish clear feedback loops to ensure accurate data is used in subsequent steps.
8. Consider using a workflow management system or automation tool to streamline processes and reduce inefficiencies.

By addressing these root causes and implementing effective strategies, you can improve the performance of your processes and reduce delays.
