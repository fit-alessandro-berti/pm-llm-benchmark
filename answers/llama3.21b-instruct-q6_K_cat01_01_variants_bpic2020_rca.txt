After analyzing the dataset, I've identified some potential root causes for the performance issues:

**1. Inconsistent Reviewers:** The frequency of reviewers approving/rejecting each declaration is very inconsistent. For example, a reviewer may approve 5 declarations out of 10, while another reviewer rejects them all out of 20 declarations. This inconsistency can lead to delays and increased processing time.

**2. Lack of Standardization:** There's no clear standard for the format or content of a request payment, which can cause confusion among reviewers and administrators. This lack of consistency can lead to errors and rejections.

**3. Insufficient Feedback loop:** The review process seems to lack a feedback mechanism, where reviewers and administrator can provide constructive feedback on their decisions to improve future processing. This can hinder the quality of approvals and may require significant improvements.

**4. Insufficient Statistics or Benchmarks:** There's no clear indication of the average frequency for different scenarios (e.g., approving vs. rejecting requests). Lack of benchmarks can make it difficult to compare processes and identify opportunities for improvement.

**5. Reviewer Demands:** Some reviewers have very specific expectations, such as high performance thresholds (`frequency = 14`). While this may be acceptable for certain requirements, others may require more flexibility or tolerance (e.g., `performance = 1005677.500`).

To address these concerns:

1. Implement a standardized format and content for requests payment.
2. Introduce a feedback mechanism to review requests for clarity and consistency.
3. Conduct regular data reviews and benchmarks to measure process performance.
4. Develop reviewer guidelines and expectations that consider different scenarios and priorities.

By addressing these issues, the process can be streamlined, and employee productivity can increase, ultimately leading to improved services provided to employers.
