This figure visualizes the timing relationships between three types of events in a process:

- **Send Fine** (top horizontal line)  
- **Insert Fine Notification** (middle horizontal line)  
- **Send for Credit Collection** (bottom horizontal line)

The xaxis is **time**, running from 2000-01-25 on the left to 2013-04-24 on the right.

Each thin vertical mark on a horizontal line represents the occurrence of that event at a specific time:

- On the **top line**, there is a dense series of vertical gray ticks, showing many “Send Fine” events over the years.
- On the **middle line**, there are also many events (labeled “Insert Fine Notification”).
- On the **bottom line**, there are sparser events labeled “Send for Credit Collection”.

The **slanted lines** connect related events for the same case over time:

- Lines slope downward from “Send Fine” / “Insert Fine Notification” to “Send for Credit Collection”, indicating the delay between issuing a fine/notification and eventually sending the case to credit collection.
- Most of these connecting lines are light red; some are darker red, perhaps highlighting longer delays or special cases.

Overall, the visualization shows, across many individual cases, when fines and notifications are issued and how long it takes until those cases are sent for credit collection.
