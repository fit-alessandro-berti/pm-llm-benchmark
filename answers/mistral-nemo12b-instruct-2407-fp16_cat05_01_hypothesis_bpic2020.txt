Based on the provided declarations and their frequencies, here are 20 relevant questions to improve the process, along with an estimated confidence score (out of 10) indicating how likely it is that addressing these questions could lead to improvements:

1. **Q: How often are declarations rejected by different approvers at various stages?**
   - *Confidence: 9/10*
   - This can help identify bottlenecks and areas where clarity or additional training might be needed.

2. **Q: What are the most common reasons for rejection at each stage (e.g., PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION)?**
   - *Confidence: 8/10*
   - Understanding these reasons can help streamline communication and reduce rejections.

3. **Q: How many times does an employee need to resubmit a declaration before it's approved?**
   - *Confidence: 7/10*
   - High frequency might indicate issues with the initial submission process or approvers' responsiveness.

4. **Q: What is the average time taken for a declaration to go from SUBMITTED to FINAL_APPROVED?**
   - *Confidence: 8/10*
   - This can help identify inefficiencies and potential improvements in the approval workflow.

5. **Q: Which departments or employees have the highest rejection rates when submitting declarations?**
   - *Confidence: 7/10*
   - Targeted training or support could be provided to these areas.

6. **Q: How many declarations are APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER but later REJECTED by SUPERVISOR?**
   - *Confidence: 8/10*
   - High frequency might indicate a need for better communication between approvers or clearer approval criteria.

7. **Q: What is the relationship between declaration complexity (e.g., cost, number of items) and rejection rate?**
   - *Confidence: 6/10*
   - This could help identify if specific types of declarations require additional scrutiny or support.

8. **Q: Which approval paths have the highest success rates (i.e., lead to PAYMENT HANDLED)?**
   - *Confidence: 7/10*
   - Analyzing successful paths can help refine workflows and encourage best practices.

9. **Q: Which declaration types or categories are most frequently rejected?**
   - *Confidence: 8/10*
   - This can inform targeted process improvements or additional training for specific declaration types.

10. **Q: How often does a declaration need to be resubmitted after an initial REJECTED status?**
    - *Confidence: 7/10*
    - High frequency might indicate a lack of clarity in rejection reasons or the appeal process.

11. **Q: What is the average time taken for a declaration to go from SUBMITTED to PAYMENT HANDLED, excluding rejections?**
    - *Confidence: 8/10*
    - This can help benchmark performance and identify areas for improvement.

12. **Q: Which approvers have the highest approval rates or rejection rates?**
    - *Confidence: 7/10*
    - This could indicate a need for training, additional workload, or other factors affecting approvers' decisions.

13. **Q: How many declarations are REJECTED by EMPLOYEE after an initial REJECTED status?**
    - *Confidence: 6/10*
    - High frequency might suggest confusion about the appeal process or difficulty understanding rejection reasons.

14. **Q: What is the distribution of declaration approval times across different days of the week or times of day?**
    - *Confidence: 5/10*
    - This could help identify peak processing times and inform staffing adjustments or communication strategies.

15. **Q: How often do declarations go through multiple cycles of submission, rejection, resubmission before final approval?**
    - *Confidence: 7/10*
    - High frequency might indicate a need for better communication or clarification in the submission process.

16. **Q: What is the average cost or value of declarations that are eventually PAYMENT HANDLED after being rejected at least once?**
    - *Confidence: 6/10*
    - This could help identify if certain high-value declarations require extra scrutiny or support.

17. **Q: How does the rejection rate change over time for a specific declaration (e.g., tracking improvement in a particular process)?**
    - *Confidence: 5/10*
    - This could help evaluate the effectiveness of past improvements or identify trends needing intervention.

18. **Q: Which departments have the most declarations REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION?**
    - *Confidence: 7/10*
    - Targeted support or communication strategies could be implemented to reduce rejections in these departments.

19. **Q: How many declarations are initially SUBMITTED but later withdrawn, abandoned, or lost due to rejections or other issues?**
    - *Confidence: 6/10*
    - Tracking this metric can help identify and address problems with the current process.

20. **Q: What is the correlation between declaration complexity (e.g., number of items, cost) and time taken for approval?**
    - *Confidence: 5/10*
    - Understanding this relationship could inform resource allocation or process improvements to handle complex declarations more efficiently.
