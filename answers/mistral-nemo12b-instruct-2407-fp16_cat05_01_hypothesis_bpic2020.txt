Here are 20 relevant questions based on the provided process variants, along with a proposed confidence score (CS) out of 10, indicating how confident we can be in drawing conclusions from the data:

1. **Q: What is the most common process variant?**
   - CS: 10/10 (Based on frequency)

2. **Q: Which role approves declarations most frequently?**
   - CS: 9/10 (Admin, Supervisor, and Budget Owner have high frequencies)

3. **Q: What is the average time taken for a declaration to be final-approved (performance / frequency)?**
   - CS: 8/10 (Assuming performance is in time units)

4. **Q: Which role rejects declarations most frequently?**
   - CS: 9/10 (Admin, Supervisor, and Pre_Approver have high rejection frequencies)

5. **Q: What percentage of submitted declarations are eventually approved and paid?**
   - CS: 8/10 (Calculate from relevant variants' frequencies)

6. **Q: Which process variant has the highest average time taken for final approval?**
   - CS: 7/10 (Based on performance/frequency, considering variant complexity)

7. **Q: How many times does an average declaration go through the 'REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' state before being approved and paid?**
   - CS: 6/10 (Estimate from relevant variants' frequencies)

8. **Q: Which role is involved in the most process variants?**
   - CS: 9/10 (Employee, Admin, Supervisor, Budget Owner, Pre_Approver)

9. **Q: What is the success rate of declarations submitted by employees who save their work before submission?**
   - CS: 5/10 (Low frequency for 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE')

10. **Q: Which process variant has the highest average payment amount?**
    - CS: 7/10 (Based on performance, considering variant frequencies)

11. **Q: What is the average number of approval/rejection cycles before a declaration is final-approved?**
    - CS: 6/10 (Estimate from relevant variants' frequencies and states)

12. **Q: Which role is responsible for the most delays in the process (based on performance)?**
    - CS: 7/10 (Compare performances of approvers/rejectors)

13. **Q: What percentage of declarations are rejected at the final approval stage?**
    - CS: 6/10 (Calculate from relevant variants' frequencies)

14. **Q: Which process variant has the lowest success rate (approval and payment)?**
    - CS: 7/10 (Based on frequencies and payments handled)

15. **Q: What is the average time taken for a declaration to be rejected after submission?**
    - CS: 6/10 (Calculate from relevant variants' performances and frequencies)

16. **Q: Which role is involved in the most process variant loops (rejections and resubmissions)?**
    - CS: 7/10 (Compare frequencies of rejection states by each role)

17. **Q: What percentage of declarations are rejected at least once before being approved and paid?**
    - CS: 6/10 (Estimate from relevant variants' frequencies)

18. **Q: Which process variant has the highest average time taken for payment handling after final approval?**
    - CS: 5/10 (Low confidence due to limited data on payment handling times)

19. **Q: What is the average number of days between declaration submission and final approval?**
    - CS: 7/10 (Calculate from relevant variants' performances and frequencies, assuming daily performance units)

20. **Q: Which role has the most influence on process duration (based on performance)?**
    - CS: 6/10 (Compare performances of approvers/rejectors, considering variant frequencies)
