To solve this problem, we need to identify the most frequent process variants from an event log and return all events belonging to cases that follow these top variants. A process variant is defined as the sequence of activities ordered by their timestamps for each case. The solution involves constructing the sequence of activities for each case, determining the top K variants by frequency, and filtering the event log to include only those cases.

### Approach
1. **Construct Process Variants**: For each case, concatenate the activities in the order they occurred using their timestamps.
2. **Count Variant Frequencies**: Group the cases by their process variants and count how many cases follow each variant.
3. **Rank Variants by Frequency**: Use a ranking function to determine the top K variants based on their frequency.
4. **Filter Cases by Top Variants**: Identify the cases that belong to the top K variants and retrieve all their events from the original log.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS variant_rank
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE variant_rank <= K  -- Replace K with the desired number
),
cases_in_top_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_variants
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN cases_in_top_variants c
ON e.case_id = c.case_id;
```

### Explanation
1. **Construct Process Variants**: The `case_variants` CTE (Common Table Expression) uses `STRING_AGG` to concatenate activities for each case in chronological order, forming a process variant string.
2. **Count Variant Frequencies**: The `variant_counts` CTE groups these variants and counts how many cases each variant has. The `RANK()` function is used to rank variants by their frequency in descending order.
3. **Select Top Variants**: The `top_variants` CTE filters the ranked variants to retain only the top K based on their rank.
4. **Filter Cases and Retrieve Events**: The `cases_in_top_variants` CTE identifies all cases belonging to the top K variants. Finally, the main query joins this with the original event log to fetch all events for these cases.

This approach efficiently identifies the most common process variants and retrieves relevant events, leveraging SQL window functions and aggregation to handle ordering and ranking.
