To construct the POWL model for the described digital service provisioning process, we'll break down the process into its constituent parts and then build the model using the provided classes and operators. Here's the Python code that represents the entire scenario:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification (SR)")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation (DA)")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization (ACI)")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration (BNC)")
D_R = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment (CD)")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment (MD)")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance (QA)")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit (SA)")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")

# Define the silent transition for the loop exit
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define the loop between BNC and D&R
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Define the exclusive choice between CD and MD
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Define the partial order for QA and SA
qa_sa = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
qa_sa.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
qa_sa.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Construct the main POWL model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, xor, qa_sa, GLA])

# Set up the partial order constraints:
# 1. CS must follow SR
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# 2. DA and ACI can be done concurrently after CS
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# 3. Loop starts after DA and ACI are completed
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)

# 4. XOR choice (CD or MD) starts after the loop ends
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

# 5. QA and SA must follow the deployment method choice
root.order.add_edge(xor, QA)
root.order.add_edge(xor, SA)

# Final Go-Live Approval (GLA) can only happen after QA and SA
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Print the constructed POWL model for verification
print(root)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Service Request Verification (SR) and Contract Setup (CS)**:
   - The `SR` must be verified first, and only then can the `CS` be performed. This is represented by the partial order `root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)`.

2. **Datacenter Allocation (DA) and Access Control Initialization (ACI)**:
   - These two tasks can be done in parallel after `CS` is completed. This is represented by `root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)` and `root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)`.

3. **Loop for Configuration Attempts**:
   - The loop starts after both `DA` and `ACI` are completed. The loop includes `BNC` followed by an optional `D&R` step. This is represented by `root.order.add_edge(DA, loop)` and `root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)`, and the loop itself is defined using `OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])`.

4. **Exclusive Choice between Deployment Methods**:
   - After the loop completes, there is an exclusive choice between `CD` (Containerized Deployment) and `MD` (Monolithic Deployment), represented by `xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])`, and `root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)`.

5. **Quality Assurance and Security Audit**:
   - Both `QA` and `SA` must be completed after the deployment method is chosen, and they can be done in any order or concurrently. This is represented by adding `QA` and `SA` to a `StrictPartialOrder` and adding edges from `xor` to both `QA` and `SA`.

6. **Go-Live Approval**:
   - The final `GLA` can only happen after both `QA` and `SA` are completed, which is represented by `root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)` and `root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)`.

This code accurately captures the described process and ensures that all dependencies and constraints are respected.
