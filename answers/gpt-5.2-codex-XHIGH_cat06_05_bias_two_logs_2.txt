**Bias appears in GroupB (Unprotected Group).**

###  Why GroupB is biased
In GroupB, candidates affiliated with the **LocalBusinessLeadersClub** receive a **+5 culturalfit boost**, which directly alters their final score and hiring outcome. This is not applied to GroupA candidates. The boost gives a **systematic advantage** that is unrelated to measured skill or personality.

### How the bias manifests
- **U001** and **U003** have *raw* CulturalFit scores of **60** and **58**, which mirror or are *lower* than candidates who were rejected in GroupA (e.g., P002 with 60).
- After the **+5 boost**, they cross the apparent hiring threshold and are **hired**.
- Candidates without the association (U002 and all of GroupA) do **not** receive that boost and are rejected with similar scores.

This is **preferential treatment based on association membership**, which is a form of direct bias and likely correlates with unprotected characteristics (e.g., local residency, social networks).

### Implications for fairness & equity
- **Unequal opportunity**: Candidates with similar merit are treated differently.
- **Disparate impact**: Unprotected/connected candidates are more likely to be hired.
- **Merit is distorted**: Association membership—not jobrelevant ability—drives outcomes.
- **Equity risk**: Such boosts can legally and ethically resemble discrimination or nepotism.

 **Conclusion:**  
**GroupB exhibits bias** because it explicitly modifies scores based on professional association membership, giving certain applicants an unjustified advantage and undermining fairness and equity in hiring.
