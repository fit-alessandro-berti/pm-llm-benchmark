## Process Description:

The process appears to be a workflow for approval of declarations submitted by employees. The process goes through different stages:

**Initial Submission:**

* Employee submits a declaration.

**Initial Approval:**

* Declaration is approved by the administration.
* Declaration is approved by the budget owner (if required).
* Declaration is approved by the pre-approver (if required).

**Final Approval:**

* Declaration is finally approved by the supervisor.

**Payment:**

* Payment is requested upon final approval.

**Possible Stages:**

* Declaration is rejected by the employee at any stage.
* Declaration is saved by the employee (in case of errors).
* Declaration is sent back to the employee for further information or correction.

**Additional Notes:**

* The frequency column indicates how many times a specific stage occurred.
* The performance column shows the total execution time for that specific stage.
* Some stages are not connected to others (e.g., Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled). This could indicate additional manual intervention or separate processes.
* The process seems to have some loops (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE). This could be due to errors in the initial submission or additional information needed from the employee.

## Potential areas for improvement:

* **Performance:** Some stages have high execution times. This could be due to various factors such as system bottlenecks, long processing times, or inefficient coding.
* **Error handling:** There are several stages where the declaration is rejected. This could be due to issues with the data, missing information, or other problems.
* **Transparency:** The process appears complex with multiple approvals and potential rejections. It would be beneficial to have a clear understanding of why each declaration is rejected and what steps are being taken to improve the process.

Overall, this process seems to be working but could be improved in terms of performance, error handling, and transparency.
