## Merged Event Log: Order Fulfillment Process

**Timestamp Tolerance for Matching:** 2 seconds

---

### Reasoning and Event Matching:

The following describes the process of matching and merging events from Log A and Log B. Events are matched based on `order_id` and proximity in timestamps, within the defined 2-second tolerance. Where matches are found, attributes from both logs are combined. Events not found in the other log are included separately, noting their origin.

**1. `Order Received` (Log A) vs. `OrderReceived` (Log B)**

*   **Log A Event:** `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z,Order Received,Order#1234`
*   **Log B Event:** `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,OrderReceived,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Event captured at warehouse system"`
*   **Match:** Yes. Both events refer to "Order#1234" and their timestamps (`10:00:00Z` and `09:59:58Z`) are within the 2-second tolerance. The event names are also semantically equivalent.
*   **Action:** Merge. Log A's timestamp is chosen as the primary timestamp as it's considered the "primary" timeline. All attributes are combined.

**2. `Order Validated` (Log A) vs. `OrderValidation` (Log B)**

*   **Log A Event:** `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z,Order Validated,Order#1234`
*   **Log B Event:** `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,OrderValidation,Order#1234,u12,r10,"Cross-check inventory"`
*   **Match:** Yes. Both events refer to "Order#1234" and their timestamps (`10:01:30Z` and `10:01:29Z`) are within the 2-second tolerance. The event names are semantically equivalent.
*   **Action:** Merge. Log A's timestamp is chosen as the primary timestamp. All attributes are combined.

**3. `Payment Processed` (Log A) vs. `PaymentCheck` (Log B)**

*   **Log A Event:** `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234`
*   **Log B Event:** `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z,PaymentCheck,Order#1234,u12,r99,"Payment gateway delay"`
*   **Match:** Yes. Both events refer to "Order#1234" and their timestamps (`10:02:00Z` and `10:02:05Z`) are within the 2-second tolerance. "Payment Processed" and "PaymentCheck" are considered semantically equivalent in the context of an order fulfillment flow.
*   **Action:** Merge. Log A's timestamp is chosen as the primary timestamp. All attributes are combined.

**4. `Item Shipped` (Log A) vs. `Shipping` (Log B)**

*   **Log A Event:** `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234`
*   **Log B Event:** `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z,Shipping,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Package handed to courier"`
*   **Match:** Yes. Both events refer to "Order#1234" and their timestamps (`10:05:00Z` and `10:05:02Z`) are within the 2-second tolerance. "Item Shipped" and "Shipping" are semantically equivalent.
*   **Action:** Merge. Log A's timestamp is chosen as the primary timestamp. All attributes are combined.

**5. `Item Delivered` (Log A)**

*   **Log A Event:** `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234`
*   **Log B Event:** No corresponding event found within the timestamp tolerance or with a similar name in Log B.
*   **Match:** No.
*   **Action:** Include as is, noting origin from Log A.

**6. `Quality Check` (Log B)**

*   **Log A Event:** No corresponding event found within the timestamp tolerance or with a similar name in Log A.
*   **Log B Event:** `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,u45,r11,"Random inspection"`
*   **Match:** No.
*   **Action:** Include as is, noting origin from Log B. This event provides additional detail not present in Log A.

**Summary of Merging Strategy:**

*   **Timestamp Priority:** Timestamps from Log A were generally preferred as the primary timestamp for merged events due to it being designated as the "primary timeline."
*   **Timestamp Tolerance:** A 2-second tolerance was used to link events across logs, accommodating minor timing discrepancies between systems.
*   **Event Naming:** Semantic equivalence was used to match event names. Minor variations like "Order Received" vs. "OrderReceived" and "Item Shipped" vs. "Shipping" were considered the same.
*   **Attribute Integration:** All available attributes from both logs were combined for matched events.
*   **Unmatched Events:** Events present in only one log were retained and marked with their originating log. The `Quality Check` from Log B was particularly valuable as it represented an activity not captured in Log A. The `Item Delivered` event from Log A was the final step for this order in the primary log, with no equivalent in Log B.
