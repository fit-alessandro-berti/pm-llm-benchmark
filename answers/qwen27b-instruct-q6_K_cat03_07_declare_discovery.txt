Certainly, below is an example of a simple `DECLARE` model representing the processes described:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessFine (
    IN frequency INT,
    IN performance DECIMAL(24, 8),
    IN operation VARCHAR(100)
)
BEGIN
   DECLARE total_procedures INT;
   SET total_procedures = 0;

   -- Define possible stages of a fine process (example values, modify as needed for actual processes)
   INSERT INTO FineProcess (
      FineProcessID, StageName, NextStage
   ) VALUES ('CREATE', 'CreateFine', 'SendFine');
   INSERT INTO FineProcess (
      FineProcessID, StageName, NextStage
   ) VALUES ('SEND_FINE', 'SendFine', 'InsertFineNotification');
   -- Add more stages as needed

   -- Main loop for each frequency of operations 
   WHILE (total_procedures < frequency) DO
      CALL HandleProcedure(
         total_procedures + 1,
         performance,
         operation
      );
      
      IF (operation = 'Send for Credit Collection') THEN
         -- Specific logic if operation is Send for Credit Collection
         CONTINUE;
      END IF;
      
      IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM FineProcess WHERE StageName = operation) THEN
         SET @next_stage = NextStage FROM FineProcess WHERE StageName = operation;
         CALL HandleProcedure(
            total_procedures + 1,
            performance,
            next_stage
         );
      ELSE
         -- Logic if there is no valid next stage for the current operation
         INSERT INTO ErrorLog (
             ProcedureID, OperationID, ErrorMessage
         ) VALUES (total_procedures + 1, (SELECT FineProcessID FROM FineProcess WHERE StageName = operation), 'No valid next stage.');
         SET total_procedures += frequency;
      END IF;
   END WHILE;

END;

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE HandleProcedure (
    IN procedure_number INT,
    IN performance DECIMAL(24, 8),
    IN operation VARCHAR(100)
) 
BEGIN
   -- Call specific procedure for each operation or log error if not found
   IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM FineProcess WHERE StageName = operation) THEN
      CALL FineProcessOperation(
         procedure_number,
         performance
      );
   ELSE
      INSERT INTO ErrorLog (
          ProcedureID, OperationID, ErrorMessage
      ) VALUES (procedure_number, 0, CONCAT('No implementation found for ', operation));
   END IF;
END$$

DELIMITER ;

-- Your specific procedures for handling each operation would go here 
CREATE PROCEDURE FineProcessOperation(
    IN procedure_number INT,
    IN performance DECIMAL(24, 8)
) AS $$
BEGIN
   -- Logic for processing the fine at 'procedure_number' with given performance
   PRINT('Processing fine ' || procedure_number || ' with a performance of ' || performance);
END$$;
```

In this `DECLARE` model, you would replace the placeholders in the `CREATE PROCEDURE ProcessFine` and `CREATE PROCEDURE FineProcessOperation` with the actual logic for each operation. This is just an example to demonstrate how one could structure such a model, the specifics will need to be tailored according to your requirements.

This `DECLARE` model allows you to dynamically process different sequences of operations based on frequency and performance metrics passed in as parameters.
