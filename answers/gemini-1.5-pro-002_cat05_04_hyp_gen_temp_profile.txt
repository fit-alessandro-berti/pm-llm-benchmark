**Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model:**

* **Receive to Approve (R-P):**  The average time is short (~1 day) with an extremely low standard deviation (1 hour).  This suggests an improbable consistency in the approval process, potentially indicating automated approval or a fixed scheduling mechanism regardless of claim specifics.
* **Approve to Notify (P-N):**  A very long average time (7 days) with a large standard deviation (2 days) indicates a significant and unpredictable delay between approval and customer notification.
* **Assign to Close (A-C):** A relatively short average time (2 hours) suggests potential premature closure of some claims, possibly bypassing necessary steps like evaluation.
* **Evaluate to Notify (E-N):** A very short average time (5 minutes) suggests an unrealistic speed for notification after evaluation, potentially indicating automated processes skipping essential checks or human intervention.

**Hypotheses for Anomalies:**

* **R-P (Receive to Approve):**  Automated approval rules might be in place, bypassing manual review for certain claim types or amounts. Alternatively, approvals might be batched and processed at specific times, leading to the low standard deviation.
* **P-N (Approve to Notify):**  Resource constraints in the notification department, manual notification processes, or reliance on external systems could lead to delays. The high standard deviation might indicate inconsistent resource availability or prioritization issues.
* **A-C (Assign to Close):**  Claims might be auto-closed upon assignment if they fall below a certain threshold or meet specific criteria.  Alternatively, some adjusters might prematurely close claims without proper evaluation.
* **E-N (Evaluate to Notify):**  Automated notification systems might be triggered immediately after evaluation, without human review. This could lead to inaccurate or incomplete notifications.

**Verification Approaches (SQL Queries):**

* **R-P (Receive to Approve - fast approvals):**

```sql
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
           (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P') -
           (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'R')
       )) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claims c
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P') -
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'R')
)) < 86400 - (3 * 3600) -- Check for approvals significantly faster than the average minus 3 standard deviations (1 day - 3 hours)
;

```

* **P-N (Approve to Notify - long delays):**

```sql
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
           (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'N') -
           (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P')
       )) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claims c
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'N') -
    (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P')
)) > 604800 + (2 * 172800); -- Check for notifications delayed more than the average plus two standard deviations (7 days + 4 days)
```

* **A-C (Assign to Close - quick closures):**

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'C'
  AND timestamp < (
      SELECT timestamp + interval '2 hours'  -- 2-hour window after assignment. Adjust as needed
      FROM claim_events ce2
      WHERE ce2.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
        AND ce2.activity = 'A'
);
```


* **E-N (Evaluate to Notify - quick notifications):**

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'N'
  AND timestamp < (
    SELECT timestamp + interval '10 minutes' -- 10-minute window after evaluation. Adjust as needed
    FROM claim_events ce2
    WHERE ce2.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
      AND ce2.activity = 'E'
  );

```


* **Correlating anomalies with adjuster, claim type, resource:**  Add `WHERE` clauses to the above queries to filter by `adjuster_id` (obtained by joining with `adjusters` table if necessary), `claim_type` (from `claims` table), or `resource` (from `claim_events` table).  This helps identify patterns related to specific individuals, claim categories, or resources.  For example, to check for quick closures by a particular adjuster:

```sql
-- ... (previous A-C query) ...
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events ce3
    WHERE ce3.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
      AND ce3.resource = 'Adjuster_X' -- Replace 'Adjuster_X' with the adjuster's identifier
);

```
These queries provide starting points for investigation and can be further refined based on specific hypotheses and the data distribution. Remember to adjust time thresholds based on ZETA factors and desired sensitivity to deviations.
