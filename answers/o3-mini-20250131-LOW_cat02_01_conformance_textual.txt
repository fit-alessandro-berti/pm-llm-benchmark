Below is the analysis of each case:

1. Case 1 follows the ideal sequence (Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order) and does not violate any process constraints.

2. Case 2 deviates from the intended process because the "Package items" activity occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the normative description, after checking inventory, payment authorization must occur before any packaging takes place. This reversal of steps is a clear violation.

3. Case 3 violates the process in two ways. First, after authorizing payment, the process unexpectedly goes to "Cancel order." Although the description implies cancellation should follow an inventory check that indicates insufficient stock (i.e. without payment authorization), if cancellation occurs then fulfillment steps should cease. The second violation is that "Ship order" is performed after "Cancel order." Ship order should never occur once an order is canceled; after cancellation, the only subsequent step should be closing the order.

4. Case 4 follows the inventory-insufficient branch. It goes from "Receive order"  "Check inventory"  "Cancel order"  "Close order," which is in accordance with the normative process when there isn’t enough stock.

5. Case 5 is problematic because it lacks the "Package items" step before "Ship order." The normative process clearly requires that items are packaged after authorization and before shipping. Therefore, skipping the packaging step before shipping violates the required process flow.

In summary, Cases 2, 3, and 5 exhibit deviations:
• Case 2 violates the required order of operations by packaging items before payment is authorized.
• Case 3 violates the process twice — authorizing payment before canceling (improper branch) and attempting to ship an order after it has been canceled.
• Case 5 violates the process by omitting the packaging step between payment authorization and shipping.
