### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

#### Data Preprocessing and Integration
To preprocess and integrate data from GPS, scanner, dispatch, and maintenance logs into a cohesive event log suitable for process mining, follow these steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
   - Standardize timestamps and location formats.
   - Ensure consistent identifiers (e.g., Vehicle ID, Driver ID, Package ID).

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Merge data sources on common keys (e.g., Vehicle ID, Timestamp).
   - Align events from different sources to create a unified event log with a consistent schema.
   - Use Case ID (Vehicle-Day) to group events for each vehicle's operational day.

3. **Challenges:**
   - **Data Synchronization:** Ensuring timestamps from different sources are aligned.
   - **Data Granularity:** GPS data may be more frequent than scanner data, requiring aggregation or interpolation.
   - **Inconsistent Event Naming:** Standardizing event types across sources.

#### Process Discovery
Use process discovery algorithms like Alpha Miner, Heuristics Miner, or Fodina to visualize the actual end-to-end delivery process:

1. **Event Log Preparation:**
   - Define activities (e.g., Depart Depot, Arrive Customer, Delivery Success, Unscheduled Stop).
   - Sequence events based on timestamps.

2. **Process Model Generation:**
   - Apply the chosen algorithm to the event log to generate a process model.
   - Visualize the model using tools like ProM, Disco, or Celonis.

3. **Model Interpretation:**
   - Identify main paths, loops, and deviations.
   - Highlight frequent activities and transitions.

#### Conformance Checking
Compare the discovered process models against the planned routes from the dispatch system:

1. **Alignment:**
   - Align the discovered model with the planned routes.
   - Use conformance checking techniques like token-based replay or alignment-based methods.

2. **Deviation Analysis:**
   - **Sequence Deviations:** Identify where the actual sequence of activities differs from the planned sequence.
   - **Unplanned Stops:** Detect stops not included in the planned route.
   - **Timing Differences:** Analyze significant timing differences between planned and actual activities.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Define and calculate the following KPIs:

1. **On-Time Delivery Rate:**
   - Percentage of deliveries completed within the customer-requested time window.
   - Calculated from scanner events (Delivery Success) and planned time windows.

2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop:**
   - Average time spent at each customer location.
   - Calculated from timestamps of Arrive Customer and Depart Customer events.

3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:**
   - Ratio of time spent traveling to time spent on service activities.
   - Calculated from GPS and scanner data.

4. **Fuel Consumption per km/package:**
   - Fuel consumption normalized by distance traveled and number of packages delivered.
   - Calculated from GPS data and fuel consumption records.

5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate:**
   - Percentage of time vehicles are actively used for deliveries.
   - Calculated from GPS and maintenance logs.

6. **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:**
   - Number and duration of traffic delays.
   - Identified from GPS data (low speed detected).

7. **Rate of Failed Deliveries:**
   - Percentage of delivery attempts that fail.
   - Calculated from scanner events (Delivery Failed).

#### Bottleneck Identification
Use process mining techniques to identify bottlenecks:

1. **Bottleneck Analysis:**
   - Identify activities with high waiting times or frequent delays.
   - Use techniques like bottleneck analysis in ProM or Celonis.

2. **Variant Analysis:**
   - Compare process variants to identify inefficient paths.
   - Analyze differences in performance metrics across variants.

3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Correlate bottlenecks with specific routes, times of day, drivers, vehicle types, traffic hotspots, or activities.
   - Quantify the impact of bottlenecks on KPIs.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

#### Potential Root Causes
1. **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
   - Static routes may not account for real-time traffic conditions.
   - Use variant analysis to compare planned vs. actual routes.

2. **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
   - Travel time estimates may not reflect actual conditions.
   - Analyze deviations between planned and actual travel times.

3. **Impact of Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
   - Traffic congestion can cause significant delays.
   - Correlate GPS data with traffic patterns to identify hotspots.

4. **High Variability in Service Time:**
   - Service time at customer locations may vary widely.
   - Analyze dwell times to identify outliers and patterns.

5. **Frequency and Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns:**
   - Vehicle breakdowns can disrupt schedules.
   - Analyze maintenance logs to identify frequent issues.

6. **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences:**
   - Driver behavior can impact efficiency.
   - Compare performance metrics across drivers.

7. **Issues Related to Failed Delivery Attempts:**
   - Failed deliveries require re-delivery, increasing costs.
   - Analyze reasons for failed deliveries and their impact.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments
- **Target Inefficiency:** Suboptimal route planning.
- **Root Cause:** Static routes do not account for real-time traffic.
- **Process Mining Insight:** Identify frequent traffic hotspots and delays.
- **Expected Impact:** Improved On-Time Delivery Rate, reduced travel time.

#### Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories
- **Target Inefficiency:** High variability in service time.
- **Root Cause:** Inefficient route sequences.
- **Process Mining Insight:** Analyze dwell times and service time variability.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduced Average Time per Delivery Stop, improved vehicle utilization.

#### Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Schedules
- **Target Inefficiency:** Frequency of vehicle breakdowns.
- **Root Cause:** Lack of predictive maintenance.
- **Process Mining Insight:** Identify patterns in maintenance logs.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduced downtime, improved vehicle utilization.

### 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

#### Operational Constraints
- **Driver Working Hours:** Ensure compliance with labor regulations.
- **Vehicle Capacities:** Optimize routes to avoid overloading.
- **Customer Time Windows:** Respect customer-requested delivery times.

#### Continuous Monitoring
- **Process Mining Dashboards:**
  - Track KPIs like On-Time Delivery Rate, Average Time per Delivery Stop, and Vehicle Utilization Rate.
  - Monitor process variants and deviations.
  - Identify new bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

- **Key Metrics and Process Views:**
  - **Delivery Performance:** On-Time Delivery Rate, Rate of Failed Deliveries.
  - **Operational Efficiency:** Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio, Vehicle Utilization Rate.
  - **Cost Management:** Fuel Consumption per km/package, Maintenance Frequency.

By following this comprehensive approach, Speedy Parcels can leverage process mining to identify inefficiencies, understand their root causes, and implement data-driven optimization strategies to improve delivery punctuality and reduce operational costs.
