Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process described and then apply it to each of the event logs provided. The goal is to find which cases deviate from the expected flow and explain why.

Starting with the normative process description. Let me break down the key steps and constraints mentioned:

1. The process always starts with "Receive order".
2. After receiving, the next step must be "Check inventory".
3. Depending on inventory availability:
   - If sufficient:
     - Then proceed to "Authorize payment" (must be after Check inventory and before Package)
     - Then "Package items" (after authorization, before shipping)
     - Then "Ship order" (after packaging)
     - Finally "Close order" (must be the last step)
   - If insufficient inventory:
     - After Check inventory, go directly to "Cancel order"
     - Then "Close order" (must be next, and close is the final step)
4. Constraints:
   - Authorize payment can't happen before Check inventory.
   - Package can't happen before authorization.
   - Ship can't happen after cancellation (so if a case ships after canceling, that's bad)
   - Close must be last in all cases.
   
Also, the key is the sequence must follow the specific branches: either the full path (Receive -> Check -> Auth -> Package -> Ship -> Close) or the short path (Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close). 

Now, let's look at each case one by one.

**Case 1:**
Timeline: R, C, Auth, Package, Ship, Close. 
This follows the full path correctly. Check inventory first, then auth, then package, ship, close. All steps in order. No violations here. So this is compliant.

**Case 2:**
R, C, Package, Auth, Ship, Close. 
Hmm, here after Check, they went directly to Package without doing Auth first. The norm says Auth must come after Check and before Package. So this skips Auth between Check and Package. That's a violation. The sequence here is R -> C -> Package, which violates the requirement that Package can't come before Auth. So this case is non-compliant.

**Case 3:**
R, C, Auth, Cancel, Ship, Close. 
Wait, after AUTH they did Cancel? But according to the norm, if inventory is sufficient, you can't cancel. The cancellation branch is only when inventory is insufficient. But here, the Check was done first (so inventory was presumably sufficient?), but then they did Auth and then Cancel. That seems odd. Wait, the steps here are Receive, Check, Authorize payment, then Cancel order. Then Ship, then Close. 

Wait, the problem is that once you've done the Check and found inventory sufficient, you shouldn't proceed to Cancel. The Cancel step is only supposed to happen if inventory is insufficient. So in case 3, after Check (which presumably found sufficient stock), the next step is Auth, which is okay, but then why Cancel? Cancel is only for when inventory is not enough. So this is a violation because they canceled an order that was supposed to be fulfillable. The sequence here after Auth is Cancel, which is not part of the normal path. The correct path after Auth would be Package, Ship, Close. But here they went to Cancel, which is not allowed in the sufficient inventory case. Also, after Cancel, they tried to Ship, which is a violation because Ship should only happen after packaging in the fulfillment path, and in the cancellation path, after Cancel you go to Close. So this case has multiple violations.

Breaking it down:
- After Auth (which should be after Check and before Package), they went to Cancel. That's not part of the intended flow. Cancel is only for when inventory is insufficient, so once you've checked and found sufficient, you can't cancel. So that's a violation.
- Then, after Cancel, they tried to Ship. But according to the norm, if you cancel, the next step should be Close. So Ship after Cancel is definitely a violation. Also, Ship can't happen after a cancellation because the cancellation is supposed to end the process before moving to fulfillment steps. 

Additionally, the Close is the last step here, but the path taken was R, C, Auth, Cancel, Ship, Close. The Close is at the end, but the sequence before that has invalid steps. So this case is definitely violating multiple rules.

**Case 4:**
R, C, Cancel, Close. 
This seems to follow the short path correctly. After Check, they went straight to Cancel and then Close. That's exactly the intended path for insufficient inventory. So this is compliant. No violations here.

**Case 5:**
R, C, Auth, Package, Ship, Close. 
Same as Case 1. This is the full path correctly followed. So compliant.

Now, let me double-check each case again to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Case 3 again: The key issue here is that after Check (which should indicate sufficient inventory), they proceeded to Auth (which is okay), but then Cancel. Cancel is only supposed to happen when inventory is insufficient. Since they checked inventory first and presumably it was sufficient (since they went through Auth), the Cancel here is a mistake. So the process should not have Cancel in that path. The sequence after Auth should be Package, Ship, Close. But instead, they went to Cancel, which is an invalid step here. Then Ship comes after Cancel, which is another violation because in the cancellation path, after Cancel you go directly to Close. So the Ship here is definitely wrong. Also, the Close is last, so that part is okay, but the steps before are invalid.

Another point: The norm says "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping), and thus the next reasonable step is to Close order." So after Cancel, you can't do anything else except Close. Therefore, the presence of Ship after Cancel is a clear violation.

Case 2's problem is the missing authorization before packaging. The sequence Check -> Package skips Auth, which is required. So that's a violation of the "Authorize payment must come before Package" rule.

Are there any other cases? Let's see:

Case 3 also has the problem of doing Auth before Cancel, which might not make sense. But the main issue is the Cancel in the sufficient inventory path. The norm doesn't mention any scenario where you can cancel after authorizing payment if inventory was sufficient. So that's a violation.

Another possible ambiguity: The norm says "if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order, the process must branch into a cancellation scenario." So the Check inventory determines the path. If in case 3, the Check was done and found sufficient, then the Cancel is invalid. So that's a clear violation.

What about Case 3's timeline: after Auth, they Cancel. Why would they do that? Maybe a data entry error, but according to the process rules, it's not allowed. So that's a violation.

Case 4 is correct. Case 5 is correct. Case 1 is correct. Case 2 is the only one with the missing Auth step. Case 3 has multiple violations: Cancel in the wrong path and Ship after Cancel.

Wait, in Case 3, after Cancel, they Ship and then Close. So the order was canceled, but then they tried to ship it. That's doubly wrong. First, the Cancel should have ended the process before Ship. Second, even if they didn't cancel properly, the Ship after Cancel is against the rules. 

So summarizing the violations:

- Case 2: Missing "Authorize payment" before "Package items". The sequence after Check is Package, skipping Auth. So the rule "Authorize payment should only occur after Check and before Package" is violated here.

- Case 3: Multiple violations:
  a. After Check (which should indicate sufficient inventory), they proceeded to Cancel, which is only allowed when inventory is insufficient. So the Cancel is in the wrong branch.
  b. After Cancel, they attempted to Ship order, which is not allowed in the cancellation path (the next step after Cancel should be Close only). So Ship after Cancel is a violation.
  c. Additionally, the Close is at the end, so that's okay, but the steps before are invalid.

So Cases 2 and 3 are the ones violating the process.

Wait, the problem says "identify which cases in the event log deviate from the intended process flow, and to explain what rules or expectations are being violated."

So need to clearly state each violation with the rule they broke.

Let me structure the answer accordingly.

First, list all cases and check each for compliance.

Case 1: All steps in correct order. No violations.

Case 2: The sequence after Check is Package before Auth. The rule says Auth must come before Package. So this violates the "Authorize payment before Package" rule.

Case 3: After Check (sufficient inventory), they went to Auth (okay), then to Cancel. Cancel is only allowed when inventory is insufficient, so that's a violation of the branching logic. Also, after Cancel, they did Ship, which is not allowed (Ship should only occur after Package in the fulfillment path, and in cancellation path, after Cancel you go to Close). So two separate violations here: Cancel in the wrong path and Ship after Cancel.

Case 4: Correct path for insufficient inventory. No violations.

Case 5: Correct path. No violations.

So Cases 2 and 3 are the ones that deviate.

Now, need to explain each violation with the corresponding rule from the normative description.

For Case 2: The norm says "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging." Since in this case, Package happened before Auth, that's a direct violation of that rule.

For Case 3:

First, after Check (which should have indicated sufficient inventory), they did Auth (which is okay), then went to Cancel. The norm says that Cancel is only for when inventory is insufficient. Since they checked and presumably had sufficient stock, the Cancel is a violation of the branching logic. The rule here is that "Cancel order" should only occur when inventory is insufficient, so doing Cancel when it's not needed is a violation.

Second, after Cancel, they did Ship. The norm says "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation." So Ship after Cancel is a violation of that rule.

Additionally, the Close is the last step in all cases, so that part is okay for Case 3, but the prior steps are invalid.

Therefore, Case 3 has two separate rule violations: incorrect Cancel in the wrong branch and Ship after cancellation.

I should make sure there are no other cases. Let me check again.

Case 3's timeline: After Auth, they went to Cancel. That's the main issue. The Auth is allowed here, but the Cancel is not. So the problem is that the Cancel is not justified by inventory being insufficient. The Check must have shown sufficient stock, so the Cancel is unnecessary and invalid.

Another possible ambiguity: Could there be a scenario where after authorizing payment, someone decides to cancel? The norm doesn't mention that possibility. The norm says once you check inventory and it's sufficient, you go through the fulfillment path. So the Cancel after Auth is an invalid step in that path.

Therefore, the main violations are in Cases 2 and 3.

Now, to structure the answer:

1. Identify which cases deviate: Cases 2 and 3.

2. Explain each violation with references to the normative rules.

For Case 2:

- Violation of the rule: "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging." In this case, Package occurred before Authorize payment, bypassing the required sequence.

For Case 3:

a. Violation of the branching logic: "Cancel order" should only be taken when inventory is insufficient. Here, after a successful Check (implying sufficient inventory), the process proceeded to Cancel, which is not allowed in the fulfillment path.

b. Violation of the rule: "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation." The Ship activity occurred after the Cancel step, which is prohibited.

Additionally, in Case 3, the sequence after Cancel should have been Close, but instead they went to Ship, which is another layer of violation.

I think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other cases. Case 5 is okay, Case 4 is okay, Case 1 is okay.

So the final answer should list Cases 2 and 3 as the deviating ones, explaining each violation with the relevant normative rules.

### **Identified Deviations and Explanations**

#### **Case 2:**
**Violations:**  
1. **Missing "Authorize Payment" before "Package Items":**  
   - **Rule Violated:** *"Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging."*  
   - **Explanation:** After checking inventory (which indicates sufficiency), the process directly proceeded to "Package items" without first authorizing payment. This violates the requirement that payment authorization must precede packaging. The sequence **Check  Package** skips the mandatory "Authorize payment" step, breaking the logical flow of the process.  

#### **Case 3:**  
**Violations:**  
1. **Unjustified "Cancel Order":**  
   - **Rule Violated:** *"Cancel order" should only be taken when inventory is insufficient."*  
   - **Explanation:** After confirming sufficient inventory via "Check inventory," the process proceeded to "Authorize payment" (a valid step in the fulfillment path) before canceling the order. Since the inventory check indicated availability, canceling the order is illogical and violates the branching logic of the process. "Cancel order" is only valid in scenarios where inventory is insufficient.  

2. **"Ship Order" after "Cancel Order":**  
   - **Rule Violated:** *"Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."*  
   - **Explanation:** After canceling the order, the process attempted to "Ship order," which is explicitly prohibited. Once an order is canceled, the only valid subsequent step is "Close order." Shipping after cancellation contradicts the normative rule that fulfillment activities (like shipping) cannot occur in the cancellation path.  

---

### **Summary of Deviations**  
| **Case ID** | **Violations** |  
|-------------|----------------|  
| **Case 2**  | - Packaging before authorization (skips "Authorize payment"). |  
| **Case 3**  | - Canceling after sufficient inventory (invalid branch). <br> - Shipping after cancellation (prohibited step). |  

### **Key Normative Rules Referenced**  
- **Sequence Constraints:**  
  - *Authorize payment* must precede *Package items* and follow *Check inventory*.  
  - *Package items* must precede *Ship order*.  
  - *Ship order* must not occur after *Cancel order*.  
  - *Close order* must always be the final step.  

Cases 2 and 3 fail to adhere to these constraints, indicating process errors such as skipped steps, incorrect branching, or logically inconsistent actions.
