Here is a single process-tree expression (using the operators ->, X, +, * and tau) that models the described hospital patient management process.

->(
  'A',
  ->(
    'RG',
    ->(
      'IA',
      ->(
        ->('TI', 'TC'),
        ->(
          X('CE', 'FBP'),
          ->(
            X(
              tau,
              *(
                ->(
                  'SC',
                  ->(
                    X('TM', 'SPT'),
                    X('FCE', 'FBA')
                  )
                ),
                tau
              )
            ),
            ->(
              +('AI', 'NC'),
              ->(
                'FAS',
                ->(
                  'DDI',
                  +('BL', +('ICP', 'MRF'))
                )
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)

Notes on structure (brief):
- The top-level is a long sequence (->) from Arrival ('A') through Registration ('RG'), Intake Assessment ('IA') and the triage sequence ->('TI','TC').
- Initial diagnostic choice is X('CE','FBP').
- After the initial test we have an exclusive evaluation X(tau, loop): tau represents "results normal" (no remediation) and the loop branch models repeated remediation if results are abnormal.
- The loop is *(cycle, tau) where cycle = ->('SC', ->( X('TM','SPT'), X('FCE','FBA') )). This enforces at least one SC  (treatment choice  re-diagnostic choice) iteration; continuation executes tau then repeats the cycle. The loop repeats until exit (normal results).
- After the loop (or the tau normal branch) we run +('AI','NC') in true concurrency, then the final sequence ->('FAS', ->('DDI', +('BL', +('ICP','MRF')))) where the last + nests a three-way concurrency for BL, ICP and MRF.

This single expression encodes the full process described.
