To accomplish this task in DuckDB, we'll break it down into several steps using SQL queries. The goal is to first identify unique process variants based on their activity sequences, then count how many times each variant appears, and finally return only the events associated with the top K most frequent variants.

Let's assume `K` is a placeholder for any specific number (e.g., 10) you want as your threshold. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### Step 1: Extract Ordered Sequence of Activities per Case

We'll create an ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id`, using window functions.

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as row_num
    FROM event_log
)
```

### Step 2: Generate a String Representation of Each Sequence

Next, we convert the sequences into strings for easier comparison and aggregation.

```sql
, sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity || ' ', ORDER BY row_num) as sequence_str
    FROM ordered_activities
    GROUP BY case_id
)
```

### Step 3: Aggregate Cases by Sequence

We now group cases by their string representation of the activity sequence and count how many times each variant occurs.

```sql
, counts AS (
    SELECT 
        sequence_str,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM sequences
    GROUP BY sequence_str
)
```

### Step 4: Identify Top K Variants

We identify the top `K` most frequent variants. For demonstration purposes, let's assume `K = 10`.

```sql
, top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        sequence_str
    FROM counts
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 10 -- Change this to your desired K value.
)
```

### Step 5: Retrieve Events Belonging to Top K Variants

Finally, we retrieve the events from the original log that correspond to cases with these top `K` sequences.

```sql
SELECT 
    e.*
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    ordered_activities o ON e.case_id = o.case_id AND e.timestamp = o.timestamp
JOIN 
    sequences s ON o.case_id = s.case_id
JOIN 
    top_k_variants tkv ON s.sequence_str = tkv.sequence_str;
```

### Full Query

Combining all steps into a single query:

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as row_num
    FROM event_log
),
sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity || ' ', ORDER BY row_num) as sequence_str
    FROM ordered_activities
    GROUP BY case_id
),
counts AS (
    SELECT 
        sequence_str,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM sequences
    GROUP BY sequence_str
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        sequence_str
    FROM counts
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 10 -- Set your K value here.
)
SELECT 
    e.*
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    ordered_activities o ON e.case_id = o.case_id AND e.timestamp = o.timestamp
JOIN 
    sequences s ON o.case_id = s.case_id
JOIN 
    top_k_variants tkv ON s.sequence_str = tkv.sequence_str;
```

This query will return the event log entries associated only with cases that follow one of the top `K` process variants, effectively filtering out less frequent or non-representative sequences.
