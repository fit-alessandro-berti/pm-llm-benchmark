Certainly! Here are **two POWL models** representing the described "GlobalTeq Solutions" hiring process.

---

## **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (XOR Branch with Community Check)**

This model directly incorporates the described *unfairness*: after the skill assessment, candidates **either** experience a standard cultural fit check **or** get routed, due to their community affiliation, through a branch ("CommunityAffiliationCheck") that subtly boosts their score. This encodes the **XOR split** where bias can enter the process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
affiliation_chk = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness: DataCompletenessCheck -> (possibly) RequestMoreInfo -> (back to) DataCompletenessCheck
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_more])

# Unfair XOR: Either Standard CulturalFitCheck OR Affiliation Check
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, affiliation_chk])

# Partial order: ReceiveApplication -> DataCompletenessLoop -> SkillAssessment -> (XOR) Cultural Check/Affiliation -> ManagerReview -> FinalDecision
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        receive_app,
        data_completeness_loop,
        skill_assess,
        cultural_xor,
        manager_review,
        final_decision
    ]
)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_completeness_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, skill_assess)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, manager_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

## **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness (No Special Community Branch)**

Here, every applicant after passing the skill assessment goes through the **same** standardized cultural fit check. There is no XOR that would introduce a bias via community affiliation.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities (same as before)
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness: DataCompletenessCheck -> (possibly) RequestMoreInfo -> (back to) DataCompletenessCheck
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_more])

# No XOR: All go through the same CulturalFitCheck
# Sequential order: ReceiveApplication -> DataCompletenessLoop -> SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerReview -> FinalDecision
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        receive_app,
        data_completeness_loop,
        skill_assess,
        cultural_fit,
        manager_review,
        final_decision
    ]
)
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_completeness_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, skill_assess)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

## **Summary Table**

| Model                    | Path after SkillAssessment                   | Description                                                                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| With Potential Unfairness| XOR: CulturalFitCheck **OR** CommunityAffiliationCheck | Branch introduces unfair score uplift for affiliated applicants                    |
| Without Unfairness       | CulturalFitCheck only                        | All applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation, removing the bias branch  |

These two POWL models correctly map the sequence and control-flow of GlobalTeq's process, emphasizing the specific XOR split where unfairness occurs in the first, and unifying paths in the second for fairness.
