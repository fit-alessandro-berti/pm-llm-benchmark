<think>
Okay, I need to create a temporal profile for the supply chain process described. The temporal profile is a dictionary where each key is a tuple of two activities that follow each other in any process execution, and the value is a tuple of average time and standard deviation between them.

First, let me list all the activities in order as per the scenario. The process steps are:

1. Supplier Selection (SS)
2. Order Placement (OP)
3. Receive Components (RC)
4. Quality Inspection (QI)
5. Component Assembly (CA)
6. Product Testing (PT)
7. Packaging (PK)
8. Warehouse Storage (WS)
9. Distribution (DT)
10. After-Sales Support (AS)

But wait, after-sales support (AS) probably happens after distribution. So the sequence is SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS. But maybe AS can occur at any point after DT? Or maybe AS is triggered after DT. The problem says each execution involves these activities, so perhaps AS is the last step.

Now, the temporal profile includes all pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one trace. For a trace like <SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS>, the pairs would be all consecutive and non-consecutive pairs. For example, (SS, OP), (SS, RC), (SS, QI), ..., up to (DT, AS).

But the task says to include a representative subset, considering pairs separated by multiple steps. So I don't need all possible pairs, just a subset that shows varying average times and std devs based on the process steps.

Let me think about each activity pair and estimate their average time and standard deviation.

Starting with consecutive pairs:

1. SS to OP: Supplier selection leads to order placement. This is a subsequent step in the same process. The time here would depend on how quickly the order is placed after selecting the supplier. Maybe a few hours to a day. Let's say average 8 hours (28800 seconds) with a std dev of 2 hours (7200 seconds).

2. OP to RC: Order placement to receiving components. This depends on the supplier's lead time. Could be a few days. Let's say average 5 days (5*86400=432000 seconds) with std dev 1 day (86400).

3. RC to QI: Receiving to inspection. Probably same day or next day. Average 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours (36000).

4. QI to CA: Inspection to assembly. Once inspected, assembly starts. Maybe a short time, like 8 hours average (28800), std dev 4 hours (14400).

5. CA to PT: Assembly to testing. After assembling, testing happens. Could take a day or so. Average 2 days (172800), std dev 1 day (86400).

6. PT to PK: Testing to packaging. If testing passes, packaging starts. Maybe a few hours. Average 4 hours (14400), std dev 2 hours (7200).

7. PK to WS: Packaging to warehouse storage. Quick, same day. Average 2 hours (7200), std dev 1 hour (3600).

8. WS to DT: Storage to distribution. Depends on shipping schedule. Maybe a few days. Average 3 days (259200), std dev 2 days (172800).

9. DT to AS: Distribution to after-sales. AS might start once the product is distributed. Could be immediate or after some time. Let's say average 1 week (604800 seconds), std dev 3 days (259200).

Now, non-consecutive pairs. For example, SS to RC: The time from selecting supplier to receiving components would be OP to RC's time plus SS to OP. So 5 days (OP-RC) + 1 day (SS-OP) = 6 days average. But since these are sequential, the total time would be the sum of the individual averages. However, the std dev would be the square root of the sum of variances. But maybe for simplicity, since the problem allows estimation, we can approximate.

But the temporal profile's pairs are not necessarily direct successors. So for example, SS to RC would have a longer average time. Let's calculate:

SS to OP: 28800 seconds (8h)
OP to RC: 432000 (5 days)
Total SS to RC: 28800 + 432000 = 460800 seconds (5.333 days, or 5 days 8 hours). Std dev would be sqrt(7200^2 + 86400^2). Let's compute that: 7200^2 = 51,840,000; 86400^2 = 7,464,960,000. Sum is 7,516,800,000. Square root is approx 86,640. So std dev is 86,640 seconds, which is about 24 hours (86400). So maybe round to 1 day (86400) for simplicity.

But perhaps the std dev increases as more steps are involved. So for SS to RC, the std dev could be higher than individual steps.

Alternatively, maybe the average time for SS to RC is the sum of the averages, and the std dev is the sum of the std devs. But that's not statistically accurate, but for the sake of estimation, maybe acceptable.

But the problem says the temporal profile is based on the average and std dev of the times between the pairs in the traces. So if in the traces, the time from SS to RC is the sum of SS-OP and OP-RC times, then the average would be the sum, and the std dev would be the square root of the sum of the variances.

But since this is an estimation, perhaps we can model it as such.

So for SS to RC:

Average: 28800 + 432000 = 460800 seconds (5.333 days)
Std dev: sqrt(7200^2 + 86400^2) = sqrt(51,840,000 + 7,464,960,000) = sqrt(7,516,800,000)  86,640 seconds  1 day (86400 seconds, rounding down).

So maybe (460800, 86400).

Another example: QI to PK. The path is QI  CA  PT  PK. So the average time would be QI-CA (28800) + CA-PT (172800) + PT-PK (14400) = 28800 + 172800 + 14400 = 207000 seconds (2.4 days). Std dev would be sqrt(14400^2 + 86400^2 + 7200^2). Let's compute:

14400^2 = 207,360,000
86400^2 = 7,464,960,000
7200^2 = 51,840,000
Sum: 7,723,160,000
sqrt  87,  let's see, 87^2 is 7569, so 87,000^2 = 7,569,000,000. 88,000^2 = 7,744,000,000. So sqrt(7,723,160,000)  87,860 seconds  24.3 hours. So std dev could be 1 day (86400) again.

Alternatively, maybe the std dev increases with each step, but this is getting complicated. Since the problem allows estimation, perhaps we can assign based on the number of steps and the variability.

Another pair: SS to DT. That's a long chain. SSOPRCQICAPTPKWSDT. The average time would be the sum of all individual averages. Let's calculate:

SS-OP: 28800
OP-RC: 432000
RC-QI: 86400
QI-CA: 28800
CA-PT: 172800
PT-PK: 14400
PK-WS: 7200
WS-DT: 259200
Total average: 28800 + 432000 = 460800; +86400  547200; +28800  576000; +172800  748800; +14400  763200; +7200  770400; +259200  1,029,600 seconds.

1,029,600 seconds is approximately 11.94 days (since 86400 * 11 = 950,400; 86400*12=1,036,800). So average around 12 days. Std dev would be the sqrt of the sum of variances. Each step's variance is (std_dev)^2.

Let's compute variances:

SS-OP: 7200^2 = 51,840,000
OP-RC: 86400^2 = 7,464,960,000
RC-QI: 36000^2 = 1,296,000,000
QI-CA: 14400^2 = 207,360,000
CA-PT: 86400^2 = 7,464,960,000
PT-PK: 7200^2 = 51,840,000
PK-WS: 3600^2 = 12,960,000
WS-DT: 172800^2 = 2,985,984,000,000 (Wait, WS-DT's std dev was 172800 seconds (2 days). So variance is (172800)^2 = 2985984000000. That's a huge number compared to others. So the total variance would be dominated by WS-DT's variance.

Summing all variances:

51,840,000 + 7,464,960,000 = 7,516,800,000
+1,296,000,000  8,812,800,000
+207,360,000  9,020,160,000
+7,464,960,000  16,485,120,000
+51,840,000  16,536,960,000
+12,960,000  16,549,920,000
+2,985,984,000,000  3,002,533,920,000

Square root of this sum is sqrt(3,002,533,920,000)  1,732,800 seconds (since 1,732,800^2 = 3,000,000,000,000 approx). So std dev is about 1,732,800 seconds, which is 20 days. But that's a very high std dev. However, since the WS-DT step has a high std dev (2 days), the overall std dev for SS-DT would be dominated by that. But maybe in reality, the variability accumulates. However, this seems too high. Maybe the estimation should consider that each step's variability adds, but perhaps the problem expects more realistic numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps for non-consecutive pairs, the std dev is a multiple based on the number of steps. For example, each additional step adds a certain amount to the std dev. But this is getting too complicated.

Given that the task allows estimation, perhaps I can proceed by selecting a subset of pairs, including some consecutive and some non-consecutive, with varying averages and std devs.

Let me plan which pairs to include:

Consecutive pairs:

- ('SS', 'OP'): 8h avg, 2h std
- ('OP', 'RC'): 5 days, 1 day std
- ('RC', 'QI'): 1 day, 0.5 days std
- ('QI', 'CA'): 8h, 4h std
- ('CA', 'PT'): 2 days, 1 day std
- ('PT', 'PK'): 4h, 2h std
- ('PK', 'WS'): 2h, 1h std
- ('WS', 'DT'): 3 days, 2 days std
- ('DT', 'AS'): 1 week, 3 days std

Non-consecutive pairs:

- ('SS', 'RC'): SS to RC (via OP)  5 days 8h avg, std dev 1 day
- ('QI', 'PK'): QI to PK (via CA, PT)  2.4 days avg, std dev 1 day
- ('SS', 'DT'): Long chain, avg 12 days, std dev 20 days (but maybe too high, adjust to 5 days)
Wait, but WS-DT has a std dev of 2 days (172800 seconds). If the total std dev is dominated by that, then perhaps the std dev for SS-DT is around 2 days. But that doesn't make sense because the earlier steps also contribute. Alternatively, maybe the std dev increases multiplicatively. For example, each step adds a certain variance.

Alternatively, perhaps for non-consecutive pairs, the std dev is the sum of the std devs of the individual steps. But that's not statistically correct, but for estimation purposes:

For SS to RC: std devs are 2h (OP-SS) and 1 day (RC-OP). Summing 7200 + 86400 = 93600  10.5 hours. But that's not right. Variance adds, not standard deviations.

Alternatively, perhaps for each non-consecutive pair, the std dev is the maximum of the individual steps' std devs. But that's also not accurate.

Given the complexity, perhaps for the purposes of this exercise, I'll assign std devs based on the number of steps. For example, consecutive pairs have lower std devs, and longer chains have higher.

So for ('SS', 'RC'), which is two steps, maybe std dev is 1 day (86400). For ('QI', 'PK'), three steps, maybe 2 days (172800). For ('SS', 'DT'), many steps, maybe 5 days (259200).

Now, let's construct the dictionary with a representative subset.

Including consecutive pairs and some non-consecutive.

Possible subset:

Consecutive:

('SS', 'OP'): (28800, 7200)  8h, 2h
('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400) 5d, 1d
('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200) 1d, 0.5d
('QI', 'CA'): (28800, 14400) 8h,4h
('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 86400) 2d,1d
('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 7200) 4h,2h
('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600) 2h,1h
('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 172800) 3d,2d
('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200) 7d,3d

Non-consecutive:

('SS', 'RC'): (460800, 86400) 5.333d,1d
('QI', 'PK'): (207000, 172800) 2.4d,2d (but 172800 is 2d)
('SS', 'DT'): (1039200, 2592000) 12d,30d (but this seems too high. Maybe 12d avg, 5d std (432000))
('RC', 'DT'): Let's see, RC to DT is RCQICAPTPKWSDT. The average time would be sum of each step. Let's calculate:

RC-QI: 86400
QI-CA:28800  total 115200
CA-PT:172800  288000
PT-PK:14400  302400
PK-WS:7200  309600
WS-DT:259200  568800 seconds  6.58 days. Std dev: perhaps sum of std devs? 43200 (RC-QI) +14400 (QI-CA) +86400 (CA-PT) +7200 (PT-PK) +3600 (PK-WS) +172800 (WS-DT). Summing these: 43200+14400=57600; +86400=144000; +7200=151200; +3600=154800; +172800=327600. So std dev is 327600 seconds  3.8 days. Round to 4 days (345600). So ('RC', 'DT'): (568800, 345600)

Another pair: ('OP', 'PK'). OPRCQICAPTPK. Average time: OP-RC (432000) + RC-QI (86400) + QI-CA (28800) + CA-PT (172800) + PT-PK (14400) = 432000 +86400=518400 +28800=547200 +172800=720000 +14400=734400 seconds  8.5 days. Std dev: sum of variances. OP-RC (86400^2) + RC-QI (43200^2) + QI-CA (14400^2) + CA-PT (86400^2) + PT-PK (7200^2). Compute:

86400^2 = 7,464,960,000
43200^2 = 1,870,944,000
14400^2 = 207,360,000
86400^2 again
7200^2 = 51,840,000

Sum: 7,464,960,000 +1,870,944,000 = 9,335,904,000 +207,360,000 =9,543,264,000 +7,464,960,000 =16,008,224,000 +51,840,000 =16,060,064,000. Square root is approx 126,  let's calculate 126,000^2 = 15,876,000,000. 127,000^2 = 16,129,000,000. So sqrt is around 126,900 seconds  1.47 days. So std dev could be 1.5 days (129600 seconds). So ('OP', 'PK'): (734400, 129600)

But this is getting too detailed. Since the task requires a representative subset, perhaps including 8-10 pairs, mixing consecutive and non-consecutive.

Let me select the following pairs for the dictionary:

Consecutive:

('SS', 'OP'), ('OP', 'RC), ('QI', 'CA), ('PK', 'WS), ('DT', 'AS)

Non-consecutive:

('SS', 'RC), ('QI', 'PK), ('SS', 'DT), ('RC', 'DT)

Now, assign their values.

Consecutive:

('SS', 'OP'): (28800, 7200)  8h, 2h
('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400) 5d, 1d
('QI', 'CA'): (28800, 14400) 8h,4h
('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600) 2h,1h
('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200) 7d,3d

Non-consecutive:

('SS', 'RC'): sum of SS-OP and OP-RC  28800+432000=460800 seconds (5.333d), std dev sqrt(7200^2 +86400^2)  86640  round to 86400 (1d). So (460800, 86400)
('QI', 'PK'): QICAPTPK. Average: 28800 +172800 +14400 = 207000  2.4d. Std dev: sqrt(14400^2 +86400^2 +7200^2)  sqrt(207,360,000 +7,464,960,000 +51,840,000) = sqrt(7,723,160,000)  87,860  round to 86400 (1d). So (207000, 86400)
('SS', 'DT'): Long chain. Average 12 days (1039200 seconds). Std dev: perhaps 5 days (432000) as an estimate.
('RC', 'DT'): Average 568800 seconds (6.58d), std dev 345600 (4d).

So the dictionary would look like:

{
    ('SS', 'OP'): (28800, 7200),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (28800, 14400),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200),
    ('SS', 'RC'): (460800, 86400),
    ('QI', 'PK'): (207000, 86400),
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1039200, 432000),
    ('RC', 'DT'): (568800, 345600)
}

But wait, the 'SS', 'DT' average is 1,039,200 seconds which is 12 days (12*86400=1,036,800). Close enough. The std dev is 432,000 (5 days).

Another possible pair: ('CA', 'WS'). CAPTPKWS. Average: 172800 +14400 +7200 = 191400  2.22 days. Std dev: sqrt(86400^2 +7200^2 +3600^2)  sqrt(7,464,960,000 +51,840,000 +12,960,000) = sqrt(7,529,760,000)  86,800  1 day. So (191400, 86400).

But maybe that's adding more. Let's stick to the 8 pairs above.

Now, check if the std devs make sense. For example, ('SS', 'DT') has a std dev of 5 days. Considering the variability in WS-DT (2 days), and other steps, this seems reasonable.

Another check: ('RC', 'DT') has a std dev of 4 days. The path includes WS-DT's 2-day std dev, which is a major contributor.

So the final dictionary includes a mix of short and long pairs with varying stats.
