We are going to create two POWL models for the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions.

 First, we note the steps from the description:

 1. ReceiveApplication (which includes submitting resume and questionnaire)
 2. ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck (with a loop for missing information)
 3. PreliminarySkillAssessment
 4. CulturalFitAndCommunityAffiliationCheck (with XOR branch in the first model, without in the second)
 5. ManagerialReviewAndFinalDecision

 For the loop in step 2 (ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck):
   - We have an activity that checks the resume. If information is missing, we request more info (and then check again). Otherwise, we proceed.

 We can model the loop as:
   Loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo])
   But note: the loop structure in POWL is * (A, B) meaning: execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

   In our case:
     A: The initial check (which might lead to a request for more info or proceed)
     B: The request for more info (which then leads back to A)

   However, note that after the request, we must check again. So:
     A: CheckResume (which if complete, we exit the loop; if not, we do B and then A again)
     B: RequestMoreInfo

   So the loop node would be: loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo])

   But note: the loop structure in POWL as defined in the example is such that after A, we either exit (if condition met) or we do B and then A again.

   This matches: we do CheckResume -> if complete, we exit; if not, we do RequestMoreInfo and then CheckResume again.

 For the XOR branch in the Cultural Fit step (only in the first model):

   Step 4 in the first model has two branches:
     Branch 1: Standard cultural fit evaluation (for applicants without the special affiliation)
     Branch 2: CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives an advantage, for applicants with the special affiliation)

   The description says: "either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments"

   So we have an XOR between:
     Option1: CulturalFitCheck (standard)
     Option2: CommunityAffiliationCheck (which includes the advantage)

   Note: The description says that the presence of the affiliation leads to the second branch. So the choice is exclusive.

   We model this as: 
        xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

   Then after this XOR, we proceed to the Managerial Review.

 For the second model (without unfairness), we remove the XOR and have a single activity: CulturalFitCheck.

 The entire process is sequential except for the loop and the XOR.

 Steps:

   Step 1: ReceiveApplication (we assume this is an initial activity)
   Step 2: The loop for data completeness (which includes CheckResume and RequestMoreInfo)
   Step 3: PreliminarySkillAssessment
   Step 4: Either the XOR branch (for the first model) or the single CulturalFitCheck (for the second model)
   Step 5: ManagerialReviewAndFinalDecision

 We'll model the entire process as a strict partial order with the sequence of steps.

 However, note that the loop and the XOR are nodes that contain other nodes.

 We'll create:

   For the first model (with potential unfairness):

     Activities:
        ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
        CheckResume = Transition(label="CheckResume")
        RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
        SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
        CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
        CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
        ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
        FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")   [But note: the description says ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision, so we can combine or separate?]

     However, the description says the ManagerialReview step examines borderline candidates and makes the final decision. We can model it as one activity "ManagerialReviewAndFinalDecision", but for clarity, we can break it into two? Actually, the description says "The final decision is then made", so we can have:

        ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
        FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

     But note: the ManagerialReview step is the one that makes the decision. So we can have one activity: "ManagerialReviewAndFinalDecision". Let's use:

        ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReviewAndFinalDecision")

     Steps:

        Step1: ReceiveApplication
        Step2: Loop for data completeness: loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo])
        Step3: SkillAssessment
        Step4: XOR branch: xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])
        Step5: ManagerialReview

     Now, we need to connect them in sequence.

     We'll create a partial order:

        root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_data, SkillAssessment, xor_cultural, ManagerialReview])

        Then add edges:
          ReceiveApplication -> loop_data
          loop_data -> SkillAssessment
          SkillAssessment -> xor_cultural
          xor_cultural -> ManagerialReview

     But note loop node loop node is a single node in the partial order, but internally it has structure.

   For the second model (without unfairness):

        We remove the CommunityAffiliationCheck and the XOR. Instead, we have a single CulturalFitCheck activity.

        Steps:
          ReceiveApplication
          loop_data (same as above)
          SkillAssessment
          CulturalFitCheck
          ManagerialReview

        Partial order:
          root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_data, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview])
          Edges: sequential as above.

 However, note: the description says that the ManagerialReview step is for borderline candidates? But it doesn't specify that it's conditional. We assume it happens for every candidate that passes the previous steps.

 Also note: the PreliminarySkillAssessment disqualifies applicants below a threshold. We don't model the rejection paths? The POWL model is for the happy path? Or we can model the entire flow? But the description does not detail the rejection paths. We focus on the steps for the candidates that proceed.

 Since the problem does not specify modeling the rejection paths, we model the sequential flow for the candidates that pass each step.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll create two POWL models:

 Model 1 (with unfairness):

   Activities:
     A1: ReceiveApplication
     A2: CheckResume
     A3: RequestMoreInfo
     A4: SkillAssessment
     A5: CulturalFitCheck
     A6: CommunityAffiliationCheck
     A7: ManagerialReviewAndFinalDecision

   Loop: loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A2, A3])
   XOR: xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[A5, A6])

   Partial order nodes: [A1, loop_data, A4, xor_cultural, A7]

   Edges:
     A1 -> loop_data
     loop_data -> A4
     A4 -> xor_cultural
     xor_cultural -> A7

 Model 2 (without unfairness):

   Activities:
     A1: ReceiveApplication
     A2: CheckResume
     A3: RequestMoreInfo
     A4: SkillAssessment
     A5: CulturalFitCheck   (same label as above, but now without the alternative branch)
     A7: ManagerialReviewAndFinalDecision

   Loop: loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A2, A3])

   Partial order nodes: [A1, loop_data, A4, A5, A7]

   Edges:
     A1 -> loop_data
     loop_data -> A4
     A4 -> A5
     A5 -> A7

 Let's write the code accordingly.

 Note: We must import the necessary classes and operators.

 We'll write the code in a way that we can print or visualize the models? But the problem only asks to produce the models.

 However, note: the problem says "produce two POWL models", meaning we write the code to create them.

 We'll write Python code using the pm4py library as in the example.

 But note: the example uses `from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import ...` and `from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator`

 We'll do the same.

 We'll create two functions or two separate code blocks for the two models.

 Since the problem does not require to run the code, we write the code that constructs the models.

 Let's write:

 Model 1: with potential unfairness

### POWL Models for GlobalTeq Solutions Hiring Process

#### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
CheckResume = Transition(label="CheckResume")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for resume completeness
ResumeLoop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo]
)

# XOR branch for cultural evaluation
CulturalXOR = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]
)

# Main partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    ResumeLoop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalXOR,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Add sequential edges
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, ResumeLoop)
root.order.add_edge(ResumeLoop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalXOR)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalXOR, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Structure Explanation:**  
- **Loop (`ResumeLoop`):** `CheckResume  (exit or RequestMoreInfo  loop back)`  
- **XOR Branch (`CulturalXOR`):** Exclusive choice between `CulturalFitCheck` (standard path) and `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (biased path)  
- **Unfairness Point:** The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` branch provides preferential treatment to applicants with local affiliations, creating an unfair advantage in the workflow.

#### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
CheckResume = Transition(label="CheckResume")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Single standardized path
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for resume completeness
ResumeLoop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo]
)

# Main partial order (no XOR branch)
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    ResumeLoop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,  # All applicants take this path
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Add sequential edges
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, ResumeLoop)
root.order.add_edge(ResumeLoop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Key Improvements:**  
- **Removed XOR Branch:** All applicants undergo the same `CulturalFitCheck` activity.  
- **Eliminated Bias Source:** No special path exists for applicants with local affiliations.  
- **Preserved Core Structure:** The loop for data completeness (`ResumeLoop`) and sequential skill assessment remain unchanged, maintaining process integrity while ensuring fairness.
