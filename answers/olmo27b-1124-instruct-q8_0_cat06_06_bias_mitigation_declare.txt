# Rationale:
# - **ManualReview** and **BiasMitigationCheck** are introduced as mandatory steps following sensitive attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`). This ensures that any decision made is accompanied by a review to mitigate potential biases.
# - **Coexistence Constraint for ManualReview and BiasMitigationCheck**: Ensures that activities that disclose sensitive attributes (`StartApplication`) must coexist with `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`. This prevents immediate biased decisions after sensitive attribute disclosure.
# - **Succession Constraint for RequestAdditionalInfo to ManualReview**: Prevents the decision step (`FinalDecision`) from immediately following `RequestAdditionalInfo`, introducing a review step that could mitigate potential bias.
```

This updated model introduces essential fairness constraints into the loan application process model. By enforcing manual reviews and bias checks after sensitive attributes are considered, the model significantly reduces the risk of biased decision-making. The coexistence requirements ensure that processes involving sensitive attributes must be scrutinized more carefully, while the succession constraints add necessary delays to prevent immediate biased outcomes. These modifications collectively work to promote fairness and consistency in the loan application review process.
