**Precision Parts Inc.: Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization via Process Mining**

### **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

**Process Mining for Job and Resource Reconstruction**:

Process mining techniques like *event log replay* and *directed acyclic graph (DAG) reconstruction* can reconstruct the actual flow of jobs across work centers. By tracing event sequences for each job ID (e.g., `JOB-7001`) through setup starts/ends, task starts/ends, and queue entries, we can visualize routing pathways and detect deviations from planned sequences. For resources, aggregating events by machine/operator IDs allows reconstruction of machine availability timelines, including breakdowns and setups.

**Key Metrics and Techniques**:

- **Flow Times/Lead Times/Makespan**:
  Trace each job from `Job Released` to final completion, calculating time spent between events. Aggregate these durations to analyze distributions and identify extreme/outlier cases.
- **Task Waiting Times**:
  For each machine, calculate the interval between a job’s `Queue Entry` and its `Setup Start` (or `Task Start` if no setup). Root causes for long waiting times (e.g., bottlenecks or starvation) can be identified.
- **Resource Utilization**:
  - Productive time: Sum of `Task Start` to `Task End` durations for each machine.
  - Idle time: Gaps between productive periods (excluding breakdowns).
  - Setup time: Sum of `Setup Start` to `Setup End` durations, broken down by job transition pairs.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**:
  Group setup durations by the pair `(Previous Job ID, Current Job ID)`. For each unique pair (e.g., `[JOB-6998  JOB-7001]`), calculate mean and variance of setup times. This quantifies how the sequence of jobs affects setup effort.
- **Schedule Adherence/Tardiness**:
  For each job, compute `(Actual Completion Time - Order Due Date)`. Categorize tardiness by magnitude and frequency, and analyze for correlations with job priority, routing, or disruption events.
- **Disruption Impact**:
  For each breakdown (`Breakdown Start`/`End`), assess the impact on affected jobs (e.g., extended waiting or re-routing). For priority changes (`Priority Change` event), trace the before/after sequence and measure impact on KPIs.

### **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

**Key Pathologies Identified**:

- **Critical Bottlenecks**:
  Machines with consistently high utilization and extended productive/idle periods (e.g., `MILL-02` after breakdowns).
  
- **Poor Task Prioritization**:
  `High-priority` jobs (e.g., `JOB-7005`) often enter queues after lower-priority ones, causing tardiness.

- **Suboptimal Sequencing**:
  Certain job sequences (e.g., cutting  milling for dissimilar material groups) correlate with abnormally long setup times.

- **Starvation / Bullwhip Effect**:
  Downstream machines (e.g., inspection stations) idle excessively due to upstream bottlenecks, leading to uneven WIP distribution.

**Process Mining Evidence**:

- **Bottleneck Analysis**:
  Use variants of the *Critical Path* analysis, focusing on machines with the largest cumulative task durations + setup times.
  
- **Variant Analysis**:
  Compare event logs of on-time vs. late jobs, identifying routes, resource contention periods, and setup sequences associated with delays.

- **Resource Contention**:
  Aggregate queue waiting times by job due date/priority to visualize if near-due jobs are being starved.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

**Root Causes Identified**:

- **Static Dispatching Rules**:
  Basic rules (e.g., First-Come-First-Served, EDD) fail to adapt to dynamic conditions like breakdowns or priority changes.

- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**:
  The current system does not update machine status, queue lengths, or operator availability in real-time, leading to suboptimal sequencing.

- **Inaccurate Time Estimations**:
  Planned vs. actual task/setup durations show significant variance, especially for complex jobs or inexperienced operators.

- **Uncoordinated Sequence Planning**:
  Setup time optimization is not factored into routing decisions, leading to preventable inefficiencies at bottleneck work centers.

- **Inadequate Disruption Response**:
  No formal mechanism for prioritizing urgent jobs or dynamically re-balancing loads after breakdowns.

**Process Mining to Differentiate Root Causes**:

- **Scheduling Logic FAILS vs. Capacity / Variability**:
  Isolate periods of exceptionally high utilization (capacity limitations) from periods of schedule deviations due to rule inflexibility.
- **Process Variability**:
  Use control charts on task and setup durations to identify whether delays are due to true schedule errors or inherent stochasticity in the process.

### **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**

- **Core Logic**:
  At each workstation, jobs compete using a weighted score computed from:
  - Remaining processing time (from event log statistics).
  - Due date urgency (transformed into a normalized earliness/tardiness penalty).
  - Downstream bottleneck machine load (identified via historical bottleneck analysis).
  - Estimated sequence-dependent setup time (based on prior `(Job A  Job B)` transitions).
- **Process Mining Usage**:
  - Weighing factors are calibrated to match the frequency/magnitude of tardiness, WIP accumulation, and bottleneck utilization from event logs.
  - For example, a job with high similarity to the previous job (low setup cost) is prioritized over a less similar, lower-priority job.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Reduces tardiness via better due-date and bottleneck awareness.
  - Lowers WIP through reduced queue wait times.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Realistic Time Estimates**

- **Core Logic**:
  Construct a probabilistic schedule using:
  - *Predicted task durations*: Min/mean/max estimates from historical similar jobs (accounting for materials, set up, and operators).
  - *Predictive maintenance signals*: If fascilitated by the MES, adjust machine availability windows for impending breakdowns.
  - *Dynamic rerouting*: Reassign jobs on-the-fly when predicted bottlenecks or tardiness risks emerge.
- **Process Mining Usage**:
  - Historical breakdown durations and frequencies inform scheduling horizons.
  - Setup-time models (described above) feed into inter-task dependency calculations.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - More accurate lead time promises to customers.
  - Proactive avoidance of resource overloading.

**Strategy 3: Sequence-Dependent Setup Optimization via Intelligent Batching**

- **Core Logic**:
  At identified bottleneck machines, use historical setup patterns to:
  - Batch jobs with similar setup requirements.
  - Optimize job sequencing to minimize the total number of setup transitions.
  - Dynamically adjust batch composition in response to new urgent or near-due jobs.
- **Process Mining Usage**:
  - Pair-wise setup time statistics guide batch formation and sequencing rules.
  - Correlational analysis between setup times and job/material attributes identifies useful batch dimensions.
- **Expected Impact**:
  - Reduced setup costs and machine idle times.
  - Smoother resource utilization across the shop floor.

### **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

**Discrete-Event Simulation for Validation**:
- Model Precision Parts Inc.’s shop floor as a network of queues and resource pools, calibrated with:
  - Task/setup time distributions (from event logs).
  - Bottleneck identification (from process mining).
  - Breakdown frequencies and durations.
- Test scenarios include:
  - Normal production volumes.
  - High priority/urgent job surges.
  - Sequential machine failures.
  
**Performance Comparison**:
- Simulate both baseline (current rules) and proposed strategies using identical random seeds.
- Compare tardiness, WIP, makespan, and machine utilization for each approach.
- Select strategy (or hybrid) showing greatest robustness across scenarios.

**Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation**:
- Implement a process mining dashboard tracking real-time KPIs:
  - Tardiness rate and magnitude by job priority.
  - Resource utilization (productive vs idle vs setup).
  - WIP per workcenter.
  - Deviation of actual vs. planned task durations.
- Define performance thresholds that trigger re-calibration of weights, time estimates, or batching rules.
- Periodically refresh process mining analysis (e.g., monthly) to detect new inefficiencies as product mix or machine health changes.

**Conclusion**:

By integrating process mining with advanced scheduling techniques, Precision Parts Inc. can transform from a reactive, locally-optimized job shop into a proactive, data-driven manufacturing system. The three proposed strategies—enhanced dynamic dispatching, predictive scheduling, and setup optimization—are designed to directly address the root causes of tardiness, high WIP, inefficient utilization, and schedule unpredictability. Simulation provides a risk-free environment for validation, while ongoing process mining ensures scheduling logic remains adaptable to the ever-evolving demands of high-mix, low-volume production.
