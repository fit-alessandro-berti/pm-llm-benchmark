**Reasoning and Explanation:**

1. **Timestamp Conversion:** The `parse_timestamp` function converts the timestamp strings from both logs into `datetime` objects for accurate comparisons.  The 'Z' is replaced with '+00:00' to ensure compatibility with `datetime.fromisoformat`.

2. **Matching Logic:**
   - The code iterates through Log A first, creating a dictionary for each event.
   - For each event in Log A, it searches Log B for matching events based on `order_id` and a timestamp tolerance (2 seconds).
   - If a match is found (within the tolerance), the attributes from both events are merged into a single dictionary representing the combined event. The `matched_a` and `matched_b` sets track which `order_id`s have been matched, preventing duplicate merges.
   - A break statement is used after the first matching event in Log B to avoid further matching with other events.

3. **Handling Unmatched Events:**
   - After processing Log A, the code iterates through Log B to identify events that were not matched to any event in Log A.  These events are added to the `merged_events` list.
   - Similarly, it iterates through Log A to identify events that weren't matched to any in Log B.

4. **Chronological Ordering:** The `merged_events` list is sorted by timestamp using the `sort` function and a lambda expression to specify the `timestamp` key.

5. **Attribute Merging:**  The `event_a.update(event_b)` call effectively merges the attributes from event_b into event_a.  If there are conflicting attribute names, the value from the later event (Log B in this case) takes precedence.

6. **Clear Output:**  The code prints the final merged event log, making it easy to inspect the results.

**Output of the Code:**
