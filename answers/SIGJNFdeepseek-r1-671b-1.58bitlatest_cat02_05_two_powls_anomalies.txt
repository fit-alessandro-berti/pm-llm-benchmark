Alright, so I need to analyze these two POWL models for the Hire-to-Retire process. Let me start by understanding what each model is doing.

First, let's recall the standard Hire-to-Retire process. Typically, you'd post a job ad first. Then screen candidates, conduct interviews, make a hiring decision, onboard the employee, add them to payroll, and finally close the case. The order here should be mostly sequential with maybe some optional steps or possible loops, but generally following that structure.

Looking at Model 1:

The model uses StrictPartialOrder with nodes Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close. Then there's edges connecting them in a specific way. Let me list the edges:

- Post -> Screen
8pm4py objects might be confusing here, but from code:
Screen has edges to both Decide and Interview.
Decide goes to Onboard, which then goes to Payroll, then Close.

Wait, so after Screening candidates, you can either go directly to Make Hiring Decision or Conduct Interviews? That seems odd because normally interviews would happen before the hiring decision. So in Model1, it looks like after screening, they might decide without interviewing? Or maybe interview first and then decide. But according to edges:

From Screen: edges to Decide and Interview.

Wait, but does that mean that either can come next? Because StrictPartialOrder is a partial order with precedence relations. If the model adds these edges, perhaps it's allowing for branching here. Like after screening, you could go directly to deciding or conduct interviews first. But making a decision without interviewing seems wrong unless they are hired based on the screen alone.

That would be an anomaly because normally interviews come before the hiring decision. So Model1 allows bypassing interviews and moving straight from Screen to Decide, which might result in not properly assessing candidates through interviews—a possible violation of standard practice.

Another thing: after Onboard comes Payroll then Close. That's expected. But if they have a partial order here, but since all edges are linear except the branching at Screen, other steps seem sequential.

So Model1 anomaly is that Hiring Decision can be made without conducting interviews. Also, perhaps another point—maybe the fact that Decide and Interview are both after Screen, but there’s no edge from Interview to Decide? Because according to edges:

Screen connects to Decide and Interview. But does Interview then connect anywhere?

Looking at model1's order.add_edge calls: After adding edges between Screen and Decide, Screen and Interview; then Decide is connected to Onboard.

But where is the connection after Interview? There’s no edge from Interview to any other node except maybe whatever comes next. So if you do Conduct Interviews, what happens next? Is there an edge leading out of Interview?

In Model1's code: The edges added are:

Post -> Screen

Screen -> Decide

Screen -> Interview

Decide -> Onboard

Onboard -> Payroll

Payroll -> Close

But then where does Interview go after that? Because in the model, if you choose to conduct interviews, there is no next step. Wait, maybe the StrictPartialOrder would require some order here. Maybe missing an edge from Interview to Decide?

In a standard process, Screen leads to Interviews which lead to Decide. So Model1's problem is that Screen can go directly to Decide without interviewing, and also if you choose to conduct interviews, there's no path forward because after the interview node, there’s no edge leading anywhere else.

So in model1, once Interview is done, perhaps it dead-ends? Unless another edge exists. Wait, let me check again:

The nodes are [Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close].

Edges added: Post to Screen; Screen to Decide and Screen to Interview; Decide to Onboard; Onboard to Payroll; Payroll to Close.

So after Conduct_Interviews (Interview), there's no outgoing edge. So in the partial order, you can do Screen -> Interview but then what? The model doesn't specify where Interview goes next. That means that once you conduct interviews, you can't proceed further towards Onboard or anything else because Decide is supposed to come after Screen.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding StrictPartialOrder here. Because in a partial order, if there's no precedence edge between two nodes, they might be able to be executed in any order as long as their dependencies are met? Or perhaps the model enforces that for all activities except those specified?

No, actually, from what I remember, Partial Order defines specific edges indicating which steps must precede others. If a step doesn't have an outgoing edge pointing to another node, it's not required before proceeding with other nodes.

Wait no—StrictPartialOrder might mean that the order is defined by those edges, and if there’s no path from Interview to any next step like Decide or Onboard, then after conducting interviews, you can't proceed. So in Model1, if you choose Screen -> Interview, but Interview has no outgoing edge, so you cannot move forward. That would be a dead end, making the process stuck.

But wait, model1 includes all nodes: Post is first; then Screen. After that either Decide or Interview. If they chose Decide, proceed to Onboard etc., which works. But if they choose Interview, after conducting interviews, there's nowhere else to go because no edge from Interview to any other node except perhaps...?

But according to the model1 code: The nodes include Decide and Interview as separate steps. So unless an edge exists between Interview and Decide, it's not possible. Thus Model1 has a dead end if you take the Interview path after Screen.

So that's two anomalies in Model1:

1. Allow skipping interviews (Screen directly to Decide), which is against standard process where interviews are necessary before deciding.

2. If conducting interviews, there’s no next step; so the workflow cannot proceed further—deadlock or missing edges.

That seems pretty severe because part of the model doesn't allow completing the process if you take one path, and another allows skipping a critical step (interviewing).

Now looking at Model2:

It has Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding (which is Loop(Onboard, skip)), xor_payroll (XOR between Payroll or skip), Close.

The edges are: Post to Screen and Post to Interview. So after posting a job ad, you can either screen candidates or conduct interviews first? That might be odd because normally screening comes before interviewing. If in Model2 they allow conducting Interviews immediately after Posting without Screening, that’s an anomaly. Because typically, you post the job, then screen applicants to select those to interview.

So perhaps this is a problem: allowing Interview right after Post instead of first doing Screen. So if someone starts with Post -> Interview, but hasn't screened candidates yet. That could mean interviewing unscreened candidates which might be inefficient or not standard practice.

Another edge in Model2:

Interview connects to Decide. Then Decide goes to loop_onboarding (Loop between Onboard and skip). After that, loop_onboarding connects to xor_payroll (XOR: Payroll or skip), then Close.

So the edges are Post -> Screen; Post-> Interview; Interview -> Decide; Decide -> loop_onboarding; loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll; xor_payroll -> Close.

But where does Screen go? In Model2's nodes, we have Screen but after Post. The edge from Post to Screen and then... there’s no further edges beyond Screen in the model code. So what happens after Screen?

In model2's order.add_edge calls: After Post connects to Screen and Interview; then Interview goes to Decide. But where does Screen go? There are no edges added that connect Screen to other nodes.

So if you do Post -> Screen, but there’s nowhere else to go from Screen because the code doesn't add any edge from Screen onward. Thus, after screening candidates, the process dead-ends here. So Model2 has an anomaly where Screening Candidates is a step without subsequent steps—so the workflow can't proceed further if you choose that path.

Another issue in Model2: The loop_onboarding allows looping Onboard and skip (silent transition). But onboarding typically happens once; perhaps allowing loops could mean multiple onboardings, which might not make sense. Also, after Decide, it's supposed to be onboarding once before proceeding. However, the Loop here between Onboard and a silent transition—so executing Onboard followed by either exiting or doing Onboard again? Not sure if that is standard.

Then the xor_payroll allows adding to payroll or skipping it (via XOR with skip). But Payroll is essential; you can't onboard an employee without adding them to payroll, as they need to be paid. So allowing skipping Add_to_Payroll would be a critical error because then the employee wouldn’t be on payroll—so payment issues.

Moreover, in Model2's flow: After Post -> Interview (without screening), Screen is done but nowhere else. Also:

If after Decide you have loop_onboarding which could repeat Onboarding multiple times or skip it? The Loop operator as per POWL definition: *(A,B) means execute A then either exit the loop or do B followed by A again.

So in Model2, loop_onboarding = OperatorPOWL(LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip]). So when you have a LOOP between Onboard and skip, I think this allows executing Onboard once, then perhaps repeating (if necessary?), but if the Loop operator is meant to allow repetitions. Wait, no: according to the description in POWL structures:

Loop (*) operator between two sub-models A and B means execute A, then either exit or do B followed by A again.

So loop_onboarding here has children Onboard and skip (silent transition). So when entering the Loop, you first do Onboard. Then each iteration: after Onboard, you can choose to exit the loop or do "skip" (which is a silent transition) then repeat Onboard? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait no: The loop operator's definition says that *(A,B): execute A, then either exit or execute B followed by A again. So in Model2’s case, it's Loop(Onboard, skip). Thus:

First do Onboard, then each iteration can choose to exit (end the loop) or do "skip" and then go back to Onboard.

But a silent transition is an activity without a label; perhaps acting as a bypass. So executing 'skip' would be doing nothing except allowing looping again?

Wait, that might not make sense in this context. Allowing Loop between onboarding and skip—so after the first onboarding, you can loop by skipping (i.e., do nothing) then going back to Onboarding? But why have a loop here at all? Normally, onboarding is done once.

This could be an anomaly where Model2 allows multiple onboardings or even none if they choose to skip in the Loop. Because the silent transition might allow bypassing further steps—but given that the first step in the loop is Onboard (so you must do it once), and then subsequent iterations can decide to repeat onboarding again by doing "skip" which doesn't add any activity but loops back.

But this seems odd because after making a hiring decision, you onboard the employee. Looping here would imply potentially onboarding them multiple times, or perhaps allowing for some retries? Not sure if that's standard practice. But maybe less severe than other issues.

Then there’s xor_payroll which is XOR between Payroll and skip. So either add to payroll or skip it. If you skip adding to payroll, then the employee isn't on the payroll system—which would be a critical error because they wouldn't get paid. That's a major anomaly in Model2: allowing skipping Add_to_Payroll.

So summarizing anomalies for each model:

Model1:
- Screen can go directly to Decide (skipping Interviews), which is bad.
;After conducting Interviews, no next step—dead end.
  
Model2:
!Post can go directly to Interview without Screening first.
-Screen has nowhere to go after being done; dead end.
-Loop in onboarding might allow multiple onboardings or unnecessary steps.
-XOR for Payroll allows skipping it (critical error).

Comparing severity: The critical anomalies would be those that make the process impossible to complete correctly. For Model1, if you take Interview path, you can't proceed—so workflow halts. Also, allowing decisions without interviews is a major flaw.

In Model2, Post going directly to Interviews skips Screening (which could mean interviewing candidates who weren’t screened), but also Screen dead-ends so that part of the process cannot complete. Additionally, skipping Payroll would be a critical error because payroll is essential for an employee's payment. Those are very severe issues.

Deciding which model aligns more with normative process: Need to see which anomalies have worse impact.

Model1 has two main problems but perhaps in Model2, allowing skipping of both screening (by going from Post to Interview) and Payroll (via XOR skip), plus Screen leading nowhere—so those seem even more severe. Also, the fact that after Screening there's no next step is a dead end; whereas if you go through Interviews without having screened candidates first could lead to inefficiencies but might still continue.

Wait: In Model2, Post connects to both Screen and Interview. So in some cases, maybe they do Post -> Interview (without screening). But then what about the Screening? If someone does Post -> Screen, which is followed by... nothing—so dead end elsewhere. Alternatively, if you go from Post to Interview, but after Interview, there's Decide.

So perhaps Model2 allows two paths:

1. Post -> Screen: Then can't proceed further (dead end).

2. Post -> Interview -> Decide -> Onboard loop then Payroll XOR and Close.

But in this second path, they skip Screening entirely. So maybe candidates are interviewed without being screened first—which is a bad practice because screening should happen before interviews to filter out unsuitable candidates.

So Model2 allows skipping Screen (since you can go Post->Interview) as well as allowing for dead-end if you do screen.

Additionally, in Model2’s case:

If someone follows the path Post -> Interview -> Decide -> loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll -> Close. So when they Process this way, they skipped both Screening and Payroll (if XOR skips). That's really bad because skipping screening leads to interviewing all candidates regardless of their fit, which is inefficient and not standard.

But what if you take the other path: Post -> Screen but no further steps—so process cannot proceed. So in Model2, either you choose Interview path, allowing proceeding (but with possible anomalies), or choose Screen and get stuck.

So between Model1 and Model2:

Model1's issues are dead ends after choosing Interviews, which is a problem because that part can't finish. Also allows skipping interviews by going from Screen to Decide directly—so both paths have problems: either missing critical steps (interviews) or getting stuck.

In Model2, more severe anomalies in terms of workflow logic:

- Skipping screening (going Post -> Interview).
:Screen is a dead end.
-Skipping Payroll (XOR allows skip).
-Loop onboarding might not be necessary but perhaps less severe compared to skipping payroll and interviews.

So comparing severity: Both models have critical issues, but Model2's ability to skip both Screening and Payroll seems more fundamental. Because if you don't add an employee to the payroll system, they won’t get paid—it's a core part of hiring process.

Model1 at least after making decision (without interviews), proceeds through onboarding and adding to payroll properly. Its issues are dead end for Interviews path, and allowing skipping of Interviews which is bad but perhaps in some cases people might decide without interviews (e.g., internal hires?), though it's still a deviation.

But Model2 allows more severe deviations, like missing entire steps that are critical: Screening, Payroll. So even if you take the "correct" path (which would be Post -> Interview -> Decide...), but in this case, skipping Screen is allowed and also possibly skipping Payroll.

Therefore, perhaps Model1's issues are less severe overall compared to Model2’s? Wait no—let me think again.

Model1:

- After Screening: you can do either Decide or Interview. If choose Decide (skip Interviews): possible anomaly but process continues.
If choose Interview: dead end because there's nowhere to go from Interview.

So in practice, for a workflow using Model1, the only way to successfully complete is via Screen -> Decide -> Onboard... etc., which skips interviews. But then they would have made a hiring decision without interviewing candidates—which seems fundamental process violation. The inability to proceed after conducting Interviews means that part of the model is broken.

But in real-world processes, it's possible to do an interview but Model1 doesn't allow proceeding further. So if you need both Screen and Interview before Decide, this isn’t allowed here. Instead, Screen either leads to Decide or dead-ends into Interview with no path forward.

Model2:

If someone takes Post -> Interview path (skipping screen), then proceed to decide, loop_onboarding, perhaps skipping payroll via XOR... but if they don't skip Payroll, that part is done. But the ability to skip Screening and potentially Payroll are critical errors in process logic.

So between Model1 and Model2: which has more severe anomalies? Skipping interviews (Model1) versus allowing both screening and interview steps to be skipped or dead-ended.

Alternatively, perhaps neither model follows a normative process closely, but one is less bad than the other. But considering that skipping payroll is worse than having a broken path for interviews. Also, in Model2 you can skip Payroll via XOR, which would prevent an employee from being paid—a critical problem.

So maybe Model2 has more severe issues. Therefore, even if both have anomalies, perhaps Model1 might be closer to normative except that it allows skipping Interviews and dead ends after them, while Model2’s flaws are worse.

Alternatively, in the standard process:

Post -> Screen -> Interview -> Decide -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close.

So comparing each model's structure against this.

Model1: Post connects to Screen. Then Screen splits into Decide or Interview. If you take Screen->Decide then proceed Onward; if you take Screen->Interview, no further steps (so perhaps an error here). So the correct sequence would require Screen followed by both Decide and Interview? No—because Model1's edges are from Screen to Decide and Screen to Interview but in a way that allows either/or.

Wait, maybe not. Because StrictPartialOrder might allow different paths. But if you have both options after Screen, then it’s an exclusive choice (XOR) between them, except here the model uses Partial Order without operators for XOR. So perhaps this is allowed to choose one or the other? Or are they supposed to be in a sequence?

This confusion arises because POWL has control flow operators like X and loops but Model1 doesn't use those.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: each model introduces some anomalies—variations from standard sequences. So perhaps models aren’t using proper operator structures where needed.

In Model1, instead of a sequential order after Screen (i.e., after Screen comes Interview then Decide), they branch into two possibilities which are not reconciled in any way.

So the normative process would require that Screening is followed by Interviews and then Deciding. In Model1's case, you can do either but without proper ordering, leading to potential dead-ends or skipping steps.

In Model2, even more anomalies: Screen being optional (but actually forced because it’s a dead end), Interview not preceded by Screening allows starting interviews before screening which is backwards; plus Payroll skip.

So comparing the two models:

Which aligns better with standard process?

Neither model seems to correctly represent the normative flow. However, between them, perhaps Model1 at least has some correct paths even if there are anomalies. For example: in Model1's case, someone can go Post->Screen->Decide... and proceed through Onboard etc., which is part of the process (though missing Interview). But in Model2, you have several places where steps can be skipped entirely.

So perhaps Model1’s problem allows skipping Interviews but otherwise follows some steps correctly. While Model2 has more fundamental issues with Skipping Screening and Payroll.

But on the other hand, if a model is supposed to partially order events with precedence relations as needed, then neither seems correct. But between them, maybe Model1's main issue is missing an edge from Interview->Decide, which could be fixed by adding that edge. If in Model1, after Screen you go to either Decide or Interview (which would require XOR operator), but actually the code uses a StrictPartialOrder and edges.

But given as-is, without fixing errors, comparing the two models:

The decision between them for which is closer to normative.

Given standard process steps: Post -> Screen -> Interviews -> Decision -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close.

Model1 has an issue where after Screen you can choose Decide (skipping Interview) or go to Interview but then stuck. Model2 allows path that skips Screening and possibly Payroll, which is even worse.

So the severity of anomalies in Model2 is higher: skipping critical steps like Screening and Payroll could invalidate the process entirely versus missing a step (Interview) or having dead-ends in Model1.

Therefore, perhaps Model1 more closely aligns with normative because while it has errors allowing skipped Interviews and dead ends after that, the core sequence from Post->Screen->Decide... at least handles most steps except Interview. But actually, standard process requires interview before decision so this is a major flaw in both models. However, since Model2 also allows skipping of Payroll (which is critical), I'd say Model1's issues are less severe.

But wait: if the question asks which model more closely aligns with normative despite their anomalies—so even considering that they're both incorrect but one is closer than the other.

In conclusion:

- Both have major anomalies, but between them, Model2 has more fundamental violations (skipping payroll and screening) compared to Model1's issues. So perhaps Model1 is better in terms of overall structure except for missing interview connections.
But maybe this isn't the case...

Alternatively, given that both models don’t use control-flow operators correctly where needed.

Wait, another angle: The way each model structures their process using POWL constructs (Partial Order, XOR, Loop).

Model2 uses Operators like LOOP and XOR. For example, loop_onboarding is a LOOP between Onboard and skip, but perhaps the normative process doesn’t require loops here; onboarding should be once.

But in Model1, even though they don't use operators, their strict partial order has edges that imply exclusive choices (after Screen) which might have been better modeled with XOR. So both models may misuse control flow constructs compared to standard practice.

So considering all these factors:

The key is Payroll being skippable in Model2—this makes it fundamentally wrong because adding to payroll is essential. Whereas, skipping Interviews in Model1 is also bad but perhaps not as critical if a process allows for decisions without interviews (like internal transfers or rehires). However, in standard Hiretire process, conducting an interview is usually mandatory.

But between allowing steps that can be skipped entirely (Payroll) versus ones where you might skip a step and have dead-ends. Given the severity of these anomalies, Model2's Payroll issue makes it non-compliant with basic hiring processes. Therefore, even if both models are problematic, I would say Model1 is closer to normative.

**Answer:**

Upon analyzing both POWL models for deviations from the standard Hire-to-Retire process, several key anomalies were identified:

### **POWL Model 1 Anomalies:**
1. **Skipping Interviews:** The model allows moving directly from "Screen_Candidates" to "Make_Hiring_Decision," bypassing the critical "Conduct_Interviews" step. This violates standard practice where interviews are essential for informed hiring decisions.
2. **Dead-End After Interviews:** If "Conduct_Interviews" is executed, there is no subsequent path forward (no edge from Interview to Decide), resulting in a deadlock.

### **POWL Model 2 Anomalies:**
1. **Skipping Screening:** The model allows moving directly from "Post_Job_Ad" to "Conduct_Interviews," bypassing "Screen_Candidates." This skips the vital step of filtering candidates before interviews.
2. **Dead-End After Screening:** Executing "Screen_Candidates" leads nowhere, halting the process.
3. **Skipping Payroll:** The XOR operator at payroll allows skipping "Add_to_Payroll," which is fundamental for employee payment—a critical violation.
4. **Unnecessary Onboarding Loop:** The loop around onboarding suggests multiple or optional executions of "Onboard_Employee," which deviates from the standard single execution.

### **Comparison and Conclusion:**
While both models have severe anomalies, **Model 1** more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process. Here’s why:

- Model 2's ability to skip payroll is a fundamental flaw; employees cannot be paid if not added to payroll, making this deviation critically worse than any in Model 1.
"n
- Model 2 also allows skipping screening and dead-ending after it, disrupting the workflow entirely. In contrast, Model 1’s issues (skipping interviews or deadlocking) still allow partial process completion with essential steps like onboarding and payroll.

Thus, despite its flaws, **Model 1** retains a closer structure to the standard process by preserving key sequential steps post-decision (onboarding, payroll), whereas Model 2’s deviations are more disruptive to core process integrity.
