Based on the constraints you've provided, the underlying process can be described as a multi-step approval workflow for managing declarations, most likely in the context of financial or administrative approvals. The process involves multiple stakeholders (Employee, Administration, Supervisor, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, etc.), and declarations can be approved, rejected, saved, or submitted at different stages. The main interactions between these roles are governed by the declarative constraints, which manage the sequence, occurrence, and co-existence of specific activities.

Here are the key observations from each type of constraint:

### 1. **Equivalence Constraints**:
- In several cases, one occurrence of an activity implies the same number of occurrences of another activity. For example, if "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION" happens, activities like "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR," "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER," and others should happen the same number of times.
- This shows a close relationship between different activities happening in the same process phase but under the responsibility of different roles, meaning approval steps across different roles are synchronized.

### 2. **Always Before Constraints**:
- Certain actions must have happened before others can occur. For instance, a declaration must be **submitted by the employee** before it can be **FOR_APPROVAL by the Supervisor or Pre-Approver**.
- This constraint ensures a hierarchical dependency: the Employee’s submission triggers the process, and no approval can occur without it.

### 3. **Always After Constraints**:
- Certain works must happen after certain actions. For example, "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER" must always follow a "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING." 
- This constraint typically reflects exceptions or corrections in the process, indicating that handling rejections might necessitate approvals to reinitiate the approval process or start over.

### 4. **Never Together Constraints**:
- Specific activities cannot appear in the same case (workflow instance). For example, "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" and "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" cannot happen in the same case.
- This constraint implies mutually exclusive actions in the process – i.e., if an employee saves a declaration, the declaration cannot be rejected by that employee within the same case.
- This shows clear distinctions in how a declaration progresses. Certain actions preclude others, showing strict alternative actions.

### 5. **Activity Occurrences Constraints**:
- Communicates how frequently certain events can occur in any given case. For instance, "Declaration Submissions by Employee" can range from 0 to 7 times, while "Request Payment" can occur between 0 and 1 time.
- These constraints reflect how often certain behaviors or actions can happen within the entire workflow. They suggest that some declarations likely involve multiple submissions and interactions, while others are one-time activities (such as payments).

### 6. **Directly-Follows Constraints**:
- Indicates strict sequencing between two activities in the same case. For instance, if "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" happens, it must be immediately followed by a "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING."
- This constraint reflects procedures that follow tight steps — meaning the order of actions determines process integrity.

### High-Level Overview of Underlying Process:

1. **Initial Submission by Employee**:
   - The entire process is triggered by an employee submitting a declaration.
   - Once submitted, other roles such as the Supervisor, Administration, Pre-Approver, and Budget Owner have various responsibilities in the approval or rejection of the declaration.

2. **Sequential Review and Decision-Making**:
   - Activities for reviews and approvals are governed by strict procedural rules. Actions like “FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION,” "FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR," and "FOR_APPROVAL by PRE-APPROVER" follow specific sequences based on Always Before/After constraints.
   - Decision-making (approval or rejection) is handled at different hierarchical levels (SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE-APPROVER).

3. **Approval and Rejection Cycles**:
   - The declaration might go through multiple cycles — being submitted, approved, rejected, saved, or resubmitted. The process supports this through flexible occurrence constraints (e.g., Declaration Approved could happen multiple times).
   - Rejections can take place at any step, which might restart or conclude workflows prematurely.

4. **Managing Final Outcomes and Payments**:
   - Once all approvals/decisions are made, the request is either **paid (if successful)** or left incomplete in the case of procedural rejections.

5. **Exceptional Cases**:
   - "NEVER TOGETHER" constraints outline specific situations where certain actions cannot coexist. For example, a declaration cannot be both saved and rejected by the Employee in the same instance, preventing conflicting states within a single case.

6. **Process Complexity**:
   - Given the number of equivalence and directly-follows constraints, this process is highly interconnected, ensuring consistency between multiple actors. For example, the equivalence between "FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION" and "Request Payment" implies that payment needs to follow or accompany certain approvals.

### Concluding Remarks:
This is a **declaration management process** that follows complex multi-actor approval and decision-making cycles. Each actor has specific responsibilities and steps in the workflow. There are mutual exclusions (some steps cannot happen together), dependencies (certain steps must occur before others), and controlled sequencing (some actions follow directly after others). The system ensures structured coordination among multiple stages and roles to process declarations in a controlled manner.

In short, the process is likely focused on handling the submission, review, approval, rejection, and payment (or closure) of declarations, with strict rules to ensure that all steps follow a predefined logical order and the appropriate actors are involved at the right times.
