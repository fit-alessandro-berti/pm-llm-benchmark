**Assumptions and Notes:**

*   **Case ID**: `order_id` is used as the case ID, representing a single order process.
*   **Activity Derivation**: Activities are derived based on key events in the tables.  More granular activities could be created if needed.
*   **Timestamp Handling**:  The earliest timestamp available for an event is used. For example, multiple item picking events are listed separately.
*   **Resource Mapping**:  The `picker_id`, `sales_person_id`, and `billing_person_id` are used to map resources to activities. Carrier ID is also used for delivery events.
*   **Multiple Deliveries/Invoices**:  The event log handles cases where an order has multiple deliveries or invoices.
*   **Missing Data**: If a resource ID is not found in the `Resources` table, the `Resource/Actor` column will be left blank.
*   **Chronological Order**: The events are ordered chronologically based on the timestamps.
*   **Optional Tables**: The `Products` and `Resources` tables were used to enrich the event log with additional attributes.
*   **Payment to Invoice Link**: Payments are linked to invoices via the `invoice_id`.
*   **No Cancellation/Return Events**: The provided data does not include information about order cancellations or returns, so these events are not included in the log.
