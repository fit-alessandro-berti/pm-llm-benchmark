Okay, let's start by carefully reading the normative process description to understand the expected sequence of activities.

The process begins with "Receive order." Then, the next step must be "Check inventory." This is crucial because the description states that inventory must be checked before any decisions about payment or fulfillment are made.

If inventory is sufficient, the sequence should be: Receive, Check, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order.

If inventory is insufficient, the sequence should be: Receive, Check, Cancel order, Close order.

Key constraints mentioned:
- "Authorize payment" must come after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
- "Package items" must come after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
- "Ship order" must come after "Package items" and should not occur after cancellation.
- "Close order" must be the final activity in all cases.

Now, let's go through each case one by one.

**Case 1:**
Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close.
This matches the expected flow for sufficient inventory. No violations here.

**Case 2:**
Sequence: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close.
Here, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the normative description, authorization should come before packaging. This violates the rule that "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items."

**Case 3:**
Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close.
First, inventory is checked, then payment is authorized. Then, the order is canceled. The description says that if inventory is insufficient, after checking, you should cancel directly, without authorizing payment. Here, payment is authorized before knowing the inventory result (but wait, inventory was checked before authorization, so technically inventory was sufficient at that point? But then why is it canceled? The description says that if inventory is insufficient, you cancel. But in this case, payment was authorized, which suggests inventory was sufficient. But then why cancel? Maybe the cancellation is due to another reason, but the normative process implies that cancellation happens only when inventory is insufficient. If inventory was sufficient (since payment was authorized), then canceling is out of sequence. Alternatively, if inventory was insufficient, payment should not have been authorized. In either case, this seems like a violation because if inventory was sufficient, canceling after authorization is not standard; if inventory was insufficient, authorization should not have happened. Also, after cancellation, shipping should not occur, which it does in this case. So multiple violations: shipping after cancellation and possibly authorizing payment when inventory was insufficient.

Wait, the description says that if inventory is insufficient, you cancel directly after checking, without authorizing payment. So if payment is authorized, it implies inventory was sufficient. But then why cancel later? The normative process doesn't mention canceling after authorization unless inventory was sufficient initially but then became unavailable. But the description doesn't mention such a scenario. The normative process only describes two clear paths: one for sufficient inventory (no cancellation) and one for insufficient inventory (cancel after check, no authorization). So this case seems to deviate because:
1. It authorizes payment then cancels, which isn't described. If inventory was sufficient at check, then canceling later is not part of the normative process.
2. It ships after cancellation, which is explicitly stated as illogical ("Ship order" should never occur after cancellation).

**Case 4:**
Sequence: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.
This matches the expected flow for insufficient inventory. No violations here.

**Case 5:**
Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close.
Missing the "Package items" step. According to the normative process, packaging must come after authorization and before shipping. So this is a violation because shipping occurs without packaging.

Now, let's summarize the violations:

Case 2: "Package items" before "Authorize payment." This violates the rule that authorization must come before packaging.

Case 3: Multiple violations:
1. After cancellation, "Ship order" occurs, which is explicitly prohibited.
2. The sequence suggests that payment was authorized then canceled, which isn't part of the normative process (since cancellation should happen right after inventory check if inventory is insufficient; if inventory was sufficient, authorization should not be followed by cancellation).

Case 5: Missing "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order," which is required.

Now, let's draft the response.

First, list the violating cases: 2, 3, 5.

Now, explain each:

Case 2: The activity "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the rule that payment must be authorized before items are packaged.

Case 3: After an order is canceled, it is shipped, which is explicitly stated as illogical. Additionally, the process authorizes payment before canceling, which is inconsistent with the normative process because if inventory was sufficient (as implied by authorization), cancellation shouldn't occur later, and if inventory was insufficient, payment shouldn't be authorized at all.

Case 5: The order is shipped without being packaged, which is a violation since packaging must precede shipping.

Now, let's write this up clearly.

The normative process for handling orders is clearly defined with two main flow paths: one for orders with sufficient inventory and one for those with insufficient inventory. The key constraints include the sequence of activities: "Receive order," "Check inventory," and then either "Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order" for sufficient inventory or "Cancel order, Close order" for insufficient inventory. Violations occur when activities are performed out of order or when the process deviates from the defined paths.

**Case 2:**
- **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
- **Explanation:** According to the normative process, payment must be authorized before items are packaged. In this case, packaging occurs before authorization, which is a clear violation of the process rules.

**Case 3:**
- **Violations:**
  1. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
  2. "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order," which is inconsistent with the normative process.
- **Explanation:** The normative process states that if inventory is insufficient, the order should be canceled immediately after checking inventory without authorizing payment. In this case, payment is authorized, suggesting that inventory was sufficient, but then the order is canceled, which is not part of the normative process. Additionally, shipping after cancellation is explicitly prohibited.

**Case 5:**
- **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items" in between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order."
- **Explanation:** The normative process requires that items be packaged before they are shipped. In this case, the packaging step is missing, leading to a violation.

In summary, the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5, with the specific deviations outlined above. Each violation is rooted in the sequence of activities not adhering to the normative process rules, which define the acceptable flow of activities for order handling.
