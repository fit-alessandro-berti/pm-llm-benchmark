Certainly! Let's walk through the **pseudo-BPMN business process** step by step and provide a **detailed explanation** of each component, the **purpose** of each activity, the **role of gateways**, and how the process flows differently depending on the **type of customer request**.

---

##  **Overview of the Business Process**

This process represents how a company handles **customer requests**, which can be either **standard** or **custom** in nature. The flow includes **validation**, **parallel checks**, **approval workflows**, and **conditional rework** to ensure that the request is **feasible**, **approved**, and **ready to proceed** before sending a final confirmation to the customer.

---

##  **Step-by-Step Explanation**

---

### **1. Start Event**
- **Purpose**: Initiates the process when a customer submits a request.
- **Trigger**: Customer submits a request (standard or custom).

---

### **2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose**: The request is logged and categorized.
- **Output**: A clear classification of the request as either **standard** or **custom**.

---

### **3. Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
- **Type**: **Exclusive (XOR) Gateway** – only one path is taken.
- **Purpose**: Directs the request to either the **standard** or **custom** processing path.
- **Condition**:
  - If **Type = Standard**, go to **Task B1**.
  - If **Type = Custom**, go to **Task B2**.

---

##  **Standard Request Path**

### **4. Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- **Purpose**: Validate the request based on standard criteria (e.g., completeness, eligibility).
- **Output**: A validated request ready for further processing.

---

### **5. Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
- **Type**: **Parallel (AND) Gateway** – both paths are executed simultaneously.
- **Purpose**: Conduct two independent checks in parallel:
  - **Task C1: "Credit Check"** – Verifies the customer's creditworthiness.
  - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"** – Confirms product availability.

---

### **6. All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
- **Purpose**: Synchronizes the two parallel paths before proceeding.
- **Condition**: Proceed only when **both checks are completed**.

---

### **7. Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- **Purpose**: Based on inventory availability and other logistics, determine the expected delivery date.

---

##  **Custom Request Path**

### **8. Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- **Purpose**: Assess whether the custom request can be fulfilled technically and logistically.
- **Output**: A feasibility report.

---

### **9. Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- **Type**: **Exclusive (XOR) Gateway**.
- **Purpose**: Decide whether the customization is possible.
- **Condition**:
  - If **Yes**, go to **Task E1**.
  - If **No**, go to **Task E2** and **End Event**.

---

### **10. Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- **Purpose**: Provide a detailed quote to the customer based on the custom request.

---

### **11. Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
- **Purpose**: Inform the customer that the request cannot be fulfilled.
- **End Event**: Process ends here for rejected custom requests.

---

##  **Post-Validation / Quotation Approval Path**

This path applies **after either the standard or custom path** completes their initial processing.

---

### **12. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Type**: **Exclusive (XOR) Gateway**.
- **Purpose**: Determine whether **manager approval** is required before finalizing the request.
- **Condition**:
  - If **Yes**, go to **Task F**.
  - If **No**, go directly to **Task G**.

---

### **13. Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- **Purpose**: Get formal approval from a manager (e.g., for pricing, delivery, or feasibility).

---

### **14. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
- **Type**: **Exclusive (XOR) Gateway**.
- **Purpose**: Evaluate whether the manager approves the request.
- **Condition**:
  - If **Yes**, go to **Task G**.
  - If **No**, go to **Task H**.

---

### **15. Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
- **Purpose**: Identify and resolve the issues that led to the rejection.
- **Loop Back**:
  - If the request was **standard**, loop back to **Task D**.
  - If the request was **custom**, loop back to **Task E1**.
- **Purpose of Loop**: Allows for **rework** and **resubmission** after adjustments.

---

### **16. Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
- **Purpose**: Finalize the financial documentation for the customer.
- **Condition**: This task is reached whether approval was needed or not, and whether it was approved or after re-evaluation.

---

### **17. Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose**: Notify the customer that the request has been processed and is ready to proceed (invoice and delivery confirmed).
- **End Event**: Process concludes.

##  **Key Concepts and Patterns**

| Concept | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **XOR Gateway** | Represents a decision point where **only one** path is taken (e.g., request type, feasibility, approval). |
| **AND Gateway** | Represents a **parallel process** where multiple tasks are executed **simultaneously**. |
| **Join Gateway** | Synchronizes parallel paths before proceeding. |
| **Loopback** | Allows for **rework** or **adjustments** after rejection, ensuring the process is **adaptive** and **flexible**. |
| **Task Differences (Standard vs. Custom)** | Standard requests go through **automated validation and checks**, while custom requests require **manual feasibility analysis and quotation**, which may be rejected outright. |

---

##  **Summary of Conditions**

| Condition | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| **Request Type = Standard** | Processed through validation, parallel checks, and delivery date calculation. |
| **Request Type = Custom** | Evaluated for feasibility; may be rejected or quoted. |
| **Approval Required** | Manager approval is sought; if denied, rework is triggered. |
| **Approval Denied** | Process loops back to appropriate step for adjustment. |
| **No Approval Needed** | Process skips approval and proceeds directly to invoicing. |

Send Confirmation  End
```

##  **Conclusion**

This business process is **adaptive**, **robust**, and **customer-focused**. It differentiates between **standard** and **custom** requests early on, applying appropriate workflows and checks. The use of **gateways** ensures that the flow remains **logical and structured**, while **loopbacks** allow for **corrections and rework** without restarting the entire process. The **approval mechanism** ensures that only validated, feasible, and authorized requests proceed to final confirmation.
