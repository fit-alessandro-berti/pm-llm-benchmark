## Step 1: Identify Cases Violating Normative Rules
To identify cases violating the normative rules, we need to check if the sequence of activities strictly follows the order specified in the normative process.

### Case 1: No Violations
- Sequence follows the normative process: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- No violations.

### Case 2: Violation
- Sequence deviates from the normative process: Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Violation:** Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check, which violates the ordering rule "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."

### Case 3: No Violations
- Sequence follows the normative process: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- No violations.

## Step 2: Identify Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions
Desiderata conditions include completing the Credit Check within 24 hours of receiving the application and informing the applicant within 48 hours of the loan decision. Additionally, performing a Follow-up Call before closing the case is recommended but not strictly required.

### Case 1: No Desiderata Violations
- Credit Check was completed shortly after receiving the application (09:30  09:00), which is within the recommended timeframe.
- Informing the applicant happened promptly after the loan decision (13:00), which is within the recommended 48 hours.
- Follow-up Call was not mentioned as completed in the event log, but this is a recommended action rather than a strict requirement.

### Case 2: Desiderata Violations
- Credit Check happened about 1 hour after the Risk Assessment, but more importantly, the overall sequence violated normative rules, making other desiderata concerns secondary.
- Informing the applicant happened shortly after the loan decision, which is within the recommended timeframe for this case, given the timing of the decision.
- Follow-up Call was not performed, which is a violation of the recommended best practice.

### Case 3: Desiderata Violations
- Credit Check was completed more than 24 hours after receiving the application (14:00  09:00), which violates the recommended best practice for timely completion of the Credit Check.
- Informing the applicant happened later than recommended 48 hours after the loan decision (16:00), which violates the recommended best practice for prompt communication.
- Follow-up Call was not mentioned as completed in the event log, which violates the recommended best practice.

## Step 3: Suggest Interpretations for Observed Behaviors
Given the constraints and recommendations, one might interpret the behaviors as follows:

- **Case 2:** The deviation from the normative process might be due to a misinterpretation of the sequence requirements or a procedural oversight. The decision to prioritize Risk Assessment before Credit Check could have been based on an incorrect assumption about the necessary sequence or an attempt to streamline the process, which led to a conflict with the normative rules.

- **Case 3:** The delay in the Credit Check and the late communication with the applicant might reflect operational backlogs or scheduling challenges rather than a deliberate choice to deviate from the recommended practices. The absence of a Follow-up Call could be due to oversight or a prioritization of immediate tasks over this recommended but non-essential step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$
