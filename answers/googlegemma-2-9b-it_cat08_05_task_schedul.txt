## Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to optimizing the scheduling process at Precision Parts Inc. using process mining, advanced analytics, and simulation. It addresses the challenges of high tardiness, WIP, unpredictable lead times, and inefficient resource utilization, proposing data-driven strategies for improvement.

**1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics:**

We'll leverage process mining to reconstruct the shop floor's actual flow and identify performance bottlenecks.  The process mining platform (e.g., Celonis, Disco) will ingest the MES event log and create a process map representing the sequence of tasks for each job across all machines.

*   **Process Mining Techniques & Metrics:**
    *   **Process Discovery:** Reconstruct the actual process flow, revealing variations and deviations from intended routings.
    *   **Conformance Checking:** Compare the actual process flow against a pre-defined ideal process model to identify non-conformances and inefficiencies.
    *   **Performance Analysis:** Calculate and visualize key metrics:
        *   **Job Flow Time:** Total time from Job Released to Task End (Quality Inspection).
        *   **Lead Time:** Time between Order Placement (external) and Job Completion.
        *   **Makespan:** Total time to complete all jobs.  Distributions (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) will be crucial to understand variability.
        *   **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):** Time spent waiting at each workstation, aggregated by machine and job priority. Box plots and histograms will visualize distributions and outliers.
        *   **Resource Utilization:** Percentage of time each machine (and operator) is actively processing jobs, undergoing setup, or idle.  We'll differentiate between planned productive time vs. actual, highlighting lost time.
        *   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** This is critical.  We’ll build a query that groups setup events by machine and previous job ID. We will then calculate the difference between the *planned* setup time (20 min in the example) and the *actual* setup time, creating a dataset of setup time penalties categorized by the preceding job. Statistical analysis (e.g., regression) will attempt to correlate setup time penalties with preceding job characteristics (material type, complexity, machine settings).
        *   **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:** Calculate the difference between the actual completion time and the due date for each job.  We’ll categorize tardiness into levels (e.g., on-time, 1-day late, >1-day late) and calculate overall tardiness rate.
        *   **Disruption Impact:** Filter the process maps and performance metrics by specific disruption events (e.g., machine breakdown, priority change).  We'll measure the impact on flow times, queue lengths, and resource utilization.

**2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies:**

Based on the process mining analysis, we'll identify key pathologies:

*   **Bottleneck Resources:** Using the "resource utilization" metric and a process map highlighting queue lengths, we'll identify machines consistently operating near or above 100% utilization while accumulating significant queues. We'll quantify their impact on overall throughput by simulating the effect of increasing capacity at these bottleneck resources.
*   **Prioritization Issues:**  Variant analysis (comparing process maps for high-priority vs. low-priority jobs) will reveal whether high-priority jobs are consistently prioritized, or if they face similar delays as lower-priority jobs.  We’ll analyze queue times and flow times for each priority level.
*   **Suboptimal Sequencing & Setup Penalties:**  The setup time analysis will highlight patterns of excessive setup times following specific job sequences on critical machines.  This indicates a lack of sequencing optimization.
*   **Starvation:**  By analyzing queue lengths and task waiting times, we can identify resources that consistently experience periods of starvation due to upstream scheduling decisions (e.g., a finishing process waiting for components from a slow machine).
*   **WIP Bullwhip Effect:** Analyzing WIP levels across the shop floor over time, we will look for amplification of demand variability – a "bullwhip effect" – which signals a lack of coordination and potentially inaccurate forecasting.

**Evidence through Process Mining:**

*   **Bottleneck Analysis:** Flow diagrams clearly highlighting queue lengths at each machine.
*   **Variant Analysis:** Process maps distinctly illustrating the differing routes and delays for high vs. low priority jobs.
*   **Sequence Analysis:** Scatter plots and histograms showing correlation between previous job characteristics and setup time penalty.
*   **Resource Contention Periods:** Event logs filtered by time periods with high resource utilization to visually identify overlapping task assignments and resource conflicts.

**3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness:**

*   **Static Dispatching Limitations:** The current rule-based system (e.g., FCFS, EDD) likely fails to adapt to real-time conditions like machine breakdowns, unexpected job complexities, and shifting priorities.
*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Local dispatching at each work center lacks a global view, leading to suboptimal decisions that negatively impact the entire shop floor.
*   **Inaccurate Task Durations:** The planned task durations may be based on historical averages and do not account for job-specific factors (material, complexity, operator skill) or real-time machine performance.
*   **Ineffective Setup Management:** Sequence-dependent setup times are not actively considered in scheduling, leading to prolonged setup durations and increased WIP.
*   **Coordination Issues:** Lack of information sharing and communication between work centers exacerbate the bullwhip effect and contribute to starvation.
*   **Disruption Handling:** The existing process lacks a robust mechanism for dynamically rescheduling jobs in response to unplanned events.

**Differentiating Issues:**

Process mining can differentiate between capacity and logic issues. If bottleneck resources *always* have long queues, regardless of job mix, the issue is likely capacity constrained. If queues vary drastically based on job type, it suggests a scheduling logic problem. For example, if analyzing task durations shows a significant variation, then the problem might be stemming from a significant variance of job tasks.



**4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies:**

*   **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules:**
    *   **Logic:** Incorporate a weighted scoring system at each workstation, prioritizing jobs based on a combination of factors: Remaining Processing Time (RPT), Due Date (D), Priority (P), Estimated Setup Time (EST) with the *previous* job, and Downstream Machine Load (DML).
    *   **Process Mining Data:**  RPT calculated dynamically from event logs.  EST predicted using historical data on sequence-dependent setup times. DML monitored in real-time through process mining.
    *   **Pathology Addressed:** Addresses suboptimal sequencing and lack of real-time visibility.
    *   **KPI Impact:** Reduced tardiness, improved resource utilization, reduced queue times.
*   **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling:**
    *   **Logic:**  Employ machine learning models (e.g., regression, neural networks) to predict task durations and setup times based on historical event data, job characteristics, and machine status. Use these predictions to proactively schedule jobs and anticipate potential bottlenecks.
    *   **Process Mining Data:** Historical task duration distributions (mined from logs), job characteristics (material, complexity), machine performance metrics (speed, breakdowns).
    *   **Pathology Addressed:** Inaccurate task duration estimations, proactive bottleneck management.
    *   **KPI Impact:** Reduced lead time, improved schedule adherence, enhanced resource utilization.
*   **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization (Batching/Sequencing):**
    *   **Logic:** Implement a batching algorithm that groups jobs requiring similar setups (material, machine settings) to minimize setup changes. Intelligent sequencing rules prioritize jobs to reduce cumulative setup times on bottleneck machines.
    *   **Process Mining Data:** Historical setup time data, job characteristics.
    *   **Pathology Addressed:** Excessive sequence-dependent setup times.
    *   **KPI Impact:** Reduced tardiness, reduced WIP, improved throughput.

**5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement:**

*   **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES):** A DES model, built using tools like AnyLogic or Arena, will simulate the shop floor’s operations.  The model will be parameterized with distributions derived from process mining data (task times, setup times, breakdown frequencies, queuing probabilities).
*   **Testing Scenarios:**
    *   **High-Load Scenarios:** Simulate periods of increased demand to test scheduling robustness.
    *   **Disruption Scenarios:**  Simulate random machine breakdowns, urgent job arrivals, and material shortages to assess the responsiveness of different strategies.
    *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Vary key parameters (e.g., due date variability, setup time penalty) to understand the strategies’ sensitivity to changing conditions.
*   **Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation:** Implement a dashboard displaying key KPIs (tardiness, WIP, utilization). Process mining will continuously monitor the actual process flow, automatically flagging deviations from expected performance.  Anomaly detection algorithms will identify emerging inefficiencies, prompting adjustments to the scheduling rules or parameter settings.  A closed-loop feedback system will use these alerts to retrain the predictive models and refine the scheduling strategy in a continuous improvement cycle.
