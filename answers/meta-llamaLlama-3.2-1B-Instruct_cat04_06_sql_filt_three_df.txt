To solve this problem, you can use DuckDB SQL to accomplish the tasks outlined in the prompt. Here is a step-by-step solution with explanations:

1. **Identify the specified sequence of three activities**: First, you need to identify any case (`case_id`) that contains the following sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' > 'Create Order' > 'Confirm Order'. This requires finding all occurrences of the specified sequence within the `event_log` table.

```duckdb
SELECT case_id
FROM event_log
WHERE 
  (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Create Order')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
```

2. **Refine the selection based on the timing condition**: After identifying the specified sequence, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is **more than 5 days**.

```duckdb
SELECT case_id
FROM event_log
WHERE timestamp >= (timestamp - INTERVAL 5 DAY) 
  AND timestamp < (timestamp + INTERVAL 5 DAY)
```

3. **Exclude the cases that meet both conditions**: Finally, exclude the cases that meet both the specified sequence and the timing condition. This can be achieved by adding an `AND` condition to the `SELECT` statement to prevent filtering out events that do not meet both conditions.

```duckdb
SELECT case_id
FROM event_log
WHERE 
  (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Create Order')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
```

Note: The final `SELECT` statement is identical for all cases. Since the first two `SELECT` statements achieve the same result and are part of the overall solution, you can simply combine the second one for simplicity:

```duckdb
SELECT case_id
FROM event_log
WHERE 
  (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Create Order')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
  OR (activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' AND activity = 'Confirm Order')
```
