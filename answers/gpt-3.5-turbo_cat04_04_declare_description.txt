"Please use the DECLARE model above to describe the underlying loan approval process in practical terms. Explain step-by-step what the process might look like from the customer's initial application to the final disbursement of funds and customer notification. Discuss how each of the constraints ensures that the process unfolds in a compliant, logically ordered manner—for example, by enforcing the preliminary credit check before gathering documents, ensuring a quality assurance review before final authorization, and preventing funds from being transferred before certain steps occur. Also, consider the real-world motivations behind these rules, such as regulatory compliance, fraud prevention, risk management, operational best practices, and customer satisfaction. Finally, speculate on the consequences if certain activities were to occur out of the prescribed order or if mandatory steps were omitted."
