### Anomalies and Hypotheses

#### Case ID: 1002
- **Anomaly**: "Confirm Shipment" activity recorded before "Perform Credit Check".
- **Hypothesis**: This could be due to a system error where shipment confirmation was prematurely logged or a policy violation where shipments were confirmed without proper credit checks.
- **Suggested SQL Query**: 
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_event_log 
WHERE case_id = 1002 
AND activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Perform Credit Check') 
ORDER BY timestamp;
```
This query will help verify the sequence and timing of these two activities to further investigate the anomaly.

#### Case ID: 1004
- **Anomaly**: "Receive Payment" activity recorded before "Confirm Shipment".
- **Hypothesis**: This could indicate a billing error, a premature payment entry, or a system lag where payments were processed but shipment confirmation was delayed.
- **Suggested SQL Query**: 
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_event_log 
WHERE case_id = 1004 
AND activity IN ('Receive Payment', 'Confirm Shipment') 
ORDER BY timestamp;
```
This query will help analyze the sequence of these activities to understand if there is a billing or processing issue.

#### Case ID: 1003
- **Anomaly**: "Ship Goods" activity recorded before "Perform Credit Check".
- **Hypothesis**: This suggests that goods were shipped without a proper credit check, which is a policy violation. It could be due to system error, oversight, or lack of training.
- **Suggested SQL Query**: 
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_event_log 
WHERE case_id = 1003 
AND activity IN ('Ship Goods', 'Perform Credit Check') 
ORDER BY timestamp;
```
This query will help review the sequence of shipping and credit checking to investigate the anomaly.

### Additional Insights from Reference Tables

To understand the context better, consider joining with the `orders` and `resources` tables:

- **For Case ID 1004**: Investigate if there's a pattern in orders processed by specific resources or departments that might indicate training or system issues.
```sql
SELECT ol.*, o.order_value, r.role, r.department
FROM order_event_log ol
JOIN orders o ON ol.case_id = o.case_id
JOIN resources r ON ol.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE ol.case_id = 1004;
```

This query will provide insights into the resources involved in processing this order, their roles, and departments, which could be indicative of broader systemic issues.

By analyzing these anomalies and their sequences in conjunction with the roles and departments of the resources involved, one can gain deeper insights into potential causes and devise appropriate corrective actions.
