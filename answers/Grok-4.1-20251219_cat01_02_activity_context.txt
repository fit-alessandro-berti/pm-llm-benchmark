### Justification of Naming Choices

The recurring activities are **Verify Documents** and **Call Customer**. These repeat within cases but serve different purposes based on their position in the sequence, the preceding events, and the additional context provided.

1. **Verify Documents** (appears twice in C001 and C003):
   - First occurrence: Always early in the process, right after initiation. It represents the initial check of submitted documents.
     → Renamed to **Initial Document Verification**.
   - Second occurrence: Happens later, after some issue resolution (customer submits additional docs in C001; account adjustment in C003).
     → In C001: **Final Document Verification** (clearly the completing check).
     → In C003: **Post-Adjustment Document Verification** (explicitly ties to the preceding adjustment step, as the context mentions re-verification after adjustment).

2. **Call Customer** (appears twice in C002 and once in others):
   - In C001 and C003 (single occurrence): The call's purpose is to resolve an incompleteness by asking the customer to provide something or return.
     → Renamed to **Request Missing Documents (Call)** (C001) and **Request Customer Return (Call)** (C003) to reflect the specific intent.
   - In C002 (two occurrences):
     - First call: Triggered by a detected discrepancy during initial verification; the call gathers information needed for adjustment.
       → Renamed to **Clarify Discrepancy (Call)**.
     - Second call: Occurs after the internal adjustment, clearly to inform/confirm with the customer.
       → Renamed to **Confirm Adjustments (Call)**.

Other activities (**Initiate Request**, **Submit Additional**, **Adjust Account**, **Approve Request**) appear only once per case, so they remain unchanged. The new names make the process flow more transparent for analysis (e.g., in process mining), clearly distinguishing initial checks from re-checks and different types/purposes of customer calls.
