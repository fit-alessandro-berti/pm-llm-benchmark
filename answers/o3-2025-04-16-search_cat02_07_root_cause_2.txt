1  Which cases are slow?

• Case 2001 (Low/A)  1 h 30 m – fast  
• Case 2004 (Low/B)  1 h 25 m – fast  
• Case 2002 (Medium/B)  26 h – slow  
• Case 2003 (High/A)  48 h – very slow  
• Case 2005 (High/B)  101 h – extremely slow  

 The performance problems are clearly in cases 2002, 2003 and 2005.

2  What patterns do the slow cases share?

a Complexity  
• Low-complexity claims never loop back for “Request Additional Documents” and finish the same morning.  
• Medium-complexity (one loop) pushes the case to the next day.  
• High-complexity (two or more loops) stretches the case to two-plus or four-plus days.  
 The number of “Request Additional Documents” events grows with Complexity and is the single biggest time-adder.

b Adjuster (Resource)  
• Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) produces three document requests in case 2005 and two in 2002.  
• Adjuster_Mike (Region A) produces two requests in case 2003.  
 Both adjusters struggle with high complexity, but Lisa’s cases last longer, suggesting heavier workload or lower experience.

c Manager (Approver)  
• Low & Medium cases are approved by Manager_Ann within minutes or hours of the last event.  
• High-complexity cases sit in Manager_Bill’s queue 23 h (case 2003) and 17 h (case 2005) before approval.  
 Manager_Bill is a bottleneck for complex work.

d Region  
• Region alone is not decisive: Region A has one very slow (2003) and one very fast case (2001); Region B has both the slowest (2005) and a fast low-complexity case (2004).  
 Region effects are indirect, driven by which adjuster/manager handles the work.

3  Why do these factors create delays?

• High-complexity policies often lack complete supporting evidence at submission, forcing repeated document cycles and back-and-forth with customers.  
• Adjusters who specialize in certain product lines (Lisa on Region B, Mike on Region A) appear to have limited bandwidth—turn-around between each request is several hours.  
• Manager_Bill may be the only approver for complex claims and can only review them late in the day, leaving cases idle overnight.  
• Each extra document request restarts the “manager clock,” so every loop multiplies the approval delay.

4  Mitigation suggestions

Process & data quality  
• Introduce an up-front “Complexity = High” checklist that customers or CSRs must complete before the claim is accepted, reducing adjuster rework.  
• Add intelligent document-recognition or e-forms that validate attachments at submission time.

Resource management  
• Cross-train additional adjusters and managers on high-complexity lines to distribute work; use workload-balancing rules so one person’s backlog does not stall every complex claim.  
• Set a service-level-objective (e.g., “Approve within 4 h of last document”) and an alert if the claim waits longer in the manager queue.

Process automation & monitoring  
• Auto-trigger a consolidated, single request listing all missing documents rather than multiple separate requests.  
• Deploy a dashboard that tracks “Average loops per claim” and “Idle time before approval” by employee; use it for coaching or temporary staffing.

Customer communication  
• Provide claimants with a portal view showing outstanding documents and deadlines to minimize the ping-pong effect.

By tightening initial data capture, balancing workloads for Adjuster_Lisa and Manager_Bill, and time-boxing approval wait steps, the organization should eliminate the long-tail durations seen in cases 2002, 2003 and 2005 while keeping low-complexity cases fast.
