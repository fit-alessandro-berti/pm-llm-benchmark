Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about a loan application process. There are two parts: normative rules that are strict and must be followed, and desiderata which are recommendations but not as strict. I need to analyze the event log provided and figure out which cases violate the normative rules and which just fail to meet the desiderata. Also, I should suggest possible justifications for the observed behaviors.

Starting with the normative rules. The process has a strict sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case. There are specific ordering rules, like Credit Check before Risk Assessment, etc. Also, certain actions are not allowed, like skipping steps or doing things out of order.

Looking at Case 1 first. The activities are in the exact order specified: Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. So this case seems to follow all the strict rules without any issues.

Moving on to Case 2. The first activity is Application Received, but the next activity is Risk Assessment without a Credit Check. That's a problem because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then they do the Credit Check after Risk Assessment, which is out of order. Next, they make a Loan Decision (Rejected), but then they Finalize Documentation. The rules say that if the loan is rejected, they shouldn't finalize documentation. After that, they Close the Case. So Case 2 has two violations: doing Risk Assessment before Credit Check and finalizing documentation after a rejection.

Case 3 starts with Application Received, but the Credit Check happens two days later, which is beyond the recommended 24 hours (desideratum). Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant two days later (again, beyond the 48-hour recommendation), Finalize Documentation, and Close Case. They also didn't do a Follow-up Call, which is part of the desiderata. So, no normative violations here, just desiderata issues.

For the desiderata part, Case 2 actually doesn't have any desiderata violations because the issues were normative, but Case 3 has several. The Credit Check took too long, Inform Applicant was late, and no Follow-up Call.

Now, thinking about possible justifications. For Case 2, the Risk Assessment before Credit Check might have been an error or oversight. Maybe the person thought they could skip it or didn't know the rules. As for finalizing documentation after rejection, perhaps they were unaware of the rule or thought it was necessary regardless of the decision. 

In Case 3, the delay in Credit Check could be due to high volume or system issues. The late Inform Applicant might be because the decision took time to process or communicate. Not doing a Follow-up Call might be due to resource constraints or an oversight.

I should also consider that sometimes, even if the rules are strict, there might be exceptional circumstances, but based on the problem, we don't have that information. So I have to stick to the given data.

So, summarizing:

Normative violations are in Case 2. Desiderata failures are in Case 3 and also in Case 2 if any, but Case 2's issues are normative, not just desiderata.

**Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance**

**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

- **Case 2:**
  - **Violation 1:** Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check, violating the sequence rule.
  - **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation was performed after Loan Decision (Rejected), which is not allowed.

**2. Desiderata Failures:**

- **Case 3:**
  - **Credit Check Delay:** Occurred two days after Application Received, exceeding the recommended 24-hour window.
  - **Late Inform Applicant:** Notification happened two days after Loan Decision, beyond the suggested 48-hour timeframe.
  - **No Follow-up Call:** This step was skipped, which is a recommended practice.

**3. Possible Justifications:**

- **Case 2:**
  - **Early Risk Assessment:** Might have been an error or misunderstanding of the process sequence.
  - **Documentation After Rejection:** Could result from a lack of awareness or misinterpretation of post-rejection procedures.

- **Case 3:**
  - **Delayed Credit Check:** Possibly due to operational constraints or system delays.
  - **Late Notification:** May be attributed to internal processing times or communication delays.
  - **Omission of Follow-up Call:** Likely due to resource limitations or oversight.

This analysis highlights the importance of adhering to strict rules while acknowledging the challenges in meeting recommended practices.
