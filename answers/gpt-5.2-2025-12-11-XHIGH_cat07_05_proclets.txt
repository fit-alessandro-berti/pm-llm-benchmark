The figure is a small modeling example of a medical laboratory workflow, shown in three parts:

**(a) Two connected process/activity diagrams**
- On the **left**, an activity flow for **“Lab visit”** (doctor/lab assistant) shows steps such as **Order entry  Take blood sample  Receive result  Judge results**, with a decision:
  - If **everything is fine**, it ends with **Send report**.
  - Otherwise, it loops to **Do tests again**, then **Receive updated result**, and finally **Send report**.
- On the **right**, an activity flow for **“Lab test”** (chemical analyst) shows **Perform test  Make report  Finish lab test**, with an optional loop for **Perform test again  Provide updated report**.
- The two processes communicate via two dashed “channel” boxes:
  - **Order system** (used to create/order a lab test)
  - **HIS** (Hospital Information System, used to exchange results/reports)

**(b) A class diagram**
- A simple UML-style class diagram with two classes: **Lab visit** and **Lab test**.
- Association **“requires”** indicates **one Lab visit requires one or more Lab tests (1..*)**.

**(c) Example message/performative record**
- A table row illustrates a communication instance, including **Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, Direction** (e.g., at 11:00 via *Order system*, *Lab visit–John* sends a *Create* request to *Lab test–HGB*).
