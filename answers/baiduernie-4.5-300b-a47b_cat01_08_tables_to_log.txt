### **Assumptions Made**:
1. Each "Items Picked" event is listed separately (with `item_id` and `quantity`), even when occurring at nearly the same time for different items in the same order. This is because items may be picked from different areas/shelves or by different staff members.
2. For deliveries split into multiple shipments (order_id=1002), each dispatch and arrival is recorded as a separate set of events.
3. For `payment_reference`, I used "REF-CC-XXX", "REF-WT-XXX", "REF-CH-XXX" as specified.
4. If additional attributes like `customer_type`, `sales_person_id`, etc., were required for the event log structure, they could be added as separate columns (these are included in the "Notes" column for clarity and brevity here).
