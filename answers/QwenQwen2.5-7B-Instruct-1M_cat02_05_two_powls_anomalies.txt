To analyze both POWL models in relation to the standard Hire-to-Retire process, we need to consider the typical sequence of events and the logic that underpins the Hire-to-Retire workflow. The standard process sequence involves posting a job advertisement, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding a new employee, adding the employee to the payroll system, and closing the case.

### Analysis of Model 1

**POWL Model 1:**
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

Post = Transition(label="Post_Job_Ad")
Screen = Transition(label="Screen_Candidates")
Interview = Transition(label="Conduct_Interviews")
Decide = Transition(label="Make_Hiring_Decision")
Onboard = Transition(label="Onboard_Employee")
Payroll = Transition(label="Add_to_Payroll")
Close = Transition(label="Close_Case")

model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```

**Anomalies:**
1. **Interview After Decision:** In a standard process, interviews typically occur before the hiring decision. The model places the Interview after Decide, which is not logically correct.
2. **Onboarding After Payroll:** In a typical workflow, onboarding should be completed before adding the employee to the payroll system. The model allows Onboarding to follow Payroll, which is incorrect.

**Model 1 Anomaly Summary:**
- **Interview After Decision:** This anomaly violates the standard sequence of events, leading to logical issues in the hiring process.
- **Onboarding After Payroll:** This anomaly also violates the standard sequence, which can lead to confusion and inefficiencies in the onboarding and payroll processes.

### Analysis of Model 2

**POWL Model 2:**
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

Post = Transition(label="Post_Job_Ad")
Screen = Transition(label="Screen_Candidates")
Interview = Transition(label="Conduct_Interviews")
Decide = Transition(label="Make_Hiring_Decision")
Onboard = Transition(label="Onboard_Employee")
Payroll = Transition(label="Add_to_Payroll")
Close = Transition(label="Close_Case")
skip = SilentTransition()

loop_onboarding = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip])
xor_payroll = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Payroll, skip])

model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close])
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview)
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```

**Anomalies:**
1. **Interview After Decision:** Similar to Model 1, this model places the Interview after Decide, which is not logically correct.
2. **Onboarding and Payroll Loop:** The Onboarding and Payroll loop introduces an artificial loop that is not part of the standard process. This can lead to repeated iterations of onboarding and payroll actions, which is inefficient and unnecessary.

**Model 2 Anomaly Summary:**
- **Interview After Decision:** This anomaly, like in Model 1, violates the standard sequence of events.
- **Onboarding and Payroll Loop:** This introduces a loop that is not part of the standard workflow, leading to potential inefficiencies and errors.

### Conclusion

Both models share similar anomalies, with the key issues being the placement of interviews after the decision-making process and the introduction of a loop in the onboarding and payroll process. However, Model 1 does not introduce a loop, and it only has one logical anomaly compared to the expected process sequence. Model 2, on the other hand, introduces a loop, which is a more severe deviation from the standard workflow.

**Model 1 More Closely Aligns with the Standard Hire-to-Retire Process:**  
Model 1 maintains a more standard sequence of events without the additional loop, making it a better representation of the normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process. The identified anomalies in Model 1 are simpler and more easily corrected, leading to a more straightforward and logically consistent process model.
