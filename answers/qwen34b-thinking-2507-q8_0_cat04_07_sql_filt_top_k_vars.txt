Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to create a DuckDB query that does several things: first, for each case_id, get the ordered sequence of activities based on timestamp. Then group those sequences to find unique process variants, count how many cases per variant, get the top K variants, and finally return all events from cases that are in those top K variants.

Hmm, I need to recall how to handle ordered sequences in SQL. Since DuckDB supports window functions, maybe I can use ROW_NUMBER() to order the activities within each case. Wait, but the problem says the sequence is determined by sorting events within the case by timestamp. So for each case_id, we need to order the activities by timestamp.

First step: For each case_id, get the list of activities in order. In SQL, to get the ordered list per group, we can use a subquery with ORDER BY timestamp. But since we need to return the sequence as a single string or array? Wait, the problem says "sequence of activities", so probably as a string joined with some separator, or maybe as an array. But in DuckDB, arrays are supported. Wait, the problem says "group cases by their complete activity sequence", so we need to represent the sequence in a way that we can group by it.

Wait, in DuckDB, if we want to create a string of the sequence, we can use LISTAGG or something similar. But I'm not sure if DuckDB has LISTAGG. Let me check. Wait, DuckDB has window functions and aggregate functions. For example, using the array_agg with order by.

Wait, maybe the best approach is to use a window function to assign a rank within each case, then aggregate the activities into an array. So for each case_id, sort by timestamp, then take the activities in order as an array.

Let me think. So first, the query would have a subquery that for each case_id, orders the activities by timestamp and then aggregates them into a sequence. But in DuckDB, the array_agg function can take an ORDER BY clause. Wait, yes, in DuckDB, array_agg allows an order by.

Wait, for example: SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id. But wait, the problem says "the ordered sequence of activities", so this would give the array of activities in order for each case_id.

But the problem says to group cases by their complete activity sequence. So each case_id's sequence is a unique variant. Wait, no: the process variant is the ordered sequence. So two cases with the same activities in the same order are the same variant.

So the plan is:

1. For each case_id, get the sequence as an array of activities (ordered by timestamp).
2. Then, group by that array to get the variants.
3. Count the number of cases per variant.
4. Get the top K variants.
5. Then, filter the original event_log to include only events from case_ids that are in those top K variants.

Wait, but step 5 says: "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants." So we need to select the events where the case_id is part of the top K variants.

So the steps in the query would be:

First, compute the sequences for each case_id. Then, count how many cases per variant. Then, get the top K variants. Then, filter the original event_log to only include events from cases that are in those top K variants.

But how to handle the arrays? Because in DuckDB, when you group by an array, it's possible.

Let's outline the steps:

Step 1: Get the sequences as arrays.

SELECT 
    case_id,
    array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id

This gives for each case_id, the ordered list of activities as an array.

Step 2: Group by the activity_sequence to get variants.

But to count the number of cases per variant, we need to group by the sequence.

So next step: count the number of cases per sequence.

SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) AS case_sequences
GROUP BY activity_sequence
ORDER BY case_count DESC

But we need to get top K. So we can use LIMIT K.

Wait, but the problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So we need to get the top K variants with highest case counts.

Step 3: Get the top K variants. So the query would have a subquery that selects the top K variants.

But how to get the list of variants (the activity_sequences) that are top K.

Let's say K is a parameter. Wait, the problem says "top K variants", but the prompt doesn't specify a value for K. Wait, the problem statement says "determine the top K variants", so in the query, we need to have K as a variable. But the user hasn't specified a particular K. Wait, the problem says "the top K variants by their frequency", so maybe the query should have a parameter for K, but since it's a benchmark, perhaps the user expects the query to be written with a placeholder for K, like K=3 or something. Wait, but the problem says "the top K", so maybe the answer should have a placeholder for K, like LIMIT K.

Wait, the problem says "Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants...". So the query should be written in a way that it can take K as a parameter, but since the problem is for a benchmark, perhaps we need to write it with a specific K, but the problem statement says "top K", so probably the answer should use a parameter like K (e.g., K=3). Wait, but the problem statement says "the top K variants", so in the answer, we can use a variable for K, but in DuckDB, the LIMIT clause can take a number.

Wait, the problem says "Your task: ... 4. Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So the steps are:

1. Compute the sequences per case_id.

2. Group by sequences to get counts.

3. Get top K sequences.

4. Filter the original event_log to include only cases that are in those top K sequences.

Wait, but the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So the final output is the events from the original log where the case_id is part of the top K variants.

So the query structure is:

First, get the top K variants (the activity sequences), then get the case_ids that belong to those variants, then select the events from those case_ids.

Wait, but the problem says "the cases which are part of these top K variants". So each case in the top K variants is a case that has a sequence matching one of the top K variants.

So the steps:

- Get the top K variants (the activity sequences with highest counts).

- For each variant, get the case_ids that have that sequence.

- Then select all events from those case_ids.

But how to implement this in SQL.

Let me think.

First, create a CTE (Common Table Expression) that lists all case_ids and their sequences.

Then, count per sequence.

Then, get the top K sequences.

Then, get the case_ids that are in the top K sequences.

Then, select the events from those case_ids.

Wait, but the problem says "return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants". So the events are from the original event_log, filtered by case_id being in the top K variants' case_ids.

So the plan:

1. For each case_id, get the activity sequence (array) ordered by timestamp.

2. Count how many cases per sequence.

3. Get top K sequences (the sequences with highest counts).

4. Get all case_ids that have sequences in the top K.

5. Select events from event_log where case_id is in the list from step 4.

But how to do step 3 and 4 in DuckDB.

Let's try to write the query.

First, the sequence per case_id:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)

Then, count the variants:

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
)

Then, get the top K variants:

top_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)

Wait, but the problem says "top K variants", so K is a parameter here. However, in the problem statement, it's not specified what K is, so perhaps the answer should have K as a parameter, like K=3.

But the problem says "the top K variants", so in the query, we can use a placeholder like K.

Wait, but the problem says "the top K variants by their frequency". So the query should be written with a LIMIT clause for the top K.

But in the problem statement, the user wants the query to be written as a DuckDB SQL query that does all steps. So the answer would have a placeholder for K, like LIMIT 3.

But the problem says "top K", so maybe the answer should use a variable K. However, in DuckDB, you can't have a parameter like K in the query without specifying it. So perhaps the answer should have a specific K, but the problem says "top K", so it's better to use a placeholder.

Wait, the problem says "determine the top K variants". So the answer should have a LIMIT K.

Let's proceed.

So the top_variants CTE would be:

top_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)

Then, we need to get the case_ids that have activity_sequence in top_variants.

But how to join case_sequences with top_variants.

Wait, case_sequences has case_id and activity_sequence.

So, we can do:

selected_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants)
)

Then, the final query is:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM selected_cases)

But in DuckDB, the IN clause can be used with a subquery.

Alternatively, using a join.

Wait, but the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So the final result is the event_log entries where the case_id is in the top K variants' case_ids.

So the query steps would be:

1. Compute the activity sequences per case_id.

2. Count the variants.

3. Get top K variants.

4. Find the case_ids in top K variants.

5. Select events from event_log for those case_ids.

Let me try to write the full query.

First, the CTE for case_sequences.

Then, variant_counts.

Then, top_variants.

Then, get case_ids that are in top_variants.

But how to get the case_ids.

Wait, case_sequences has the activity_sequence for each case_id.

So the query could be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
selected_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants)
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM selected_cases)

But in DuckDB, the IN clause with a subquery is acceptable.

Wait, but the problem says "the top K variants", so K is a parameter. However, in the problem statement, the prompt says "the top K variants", so the answer should have K as a variable. But in the context of the problem, maybe the user expects to specify K as a constant (like 3) but the problem says "top K", so it's better to use a placeholder.

Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer to not specify K but have the structure with a LIMIT K.

Wait, the problem says "determine the top K variants by their frequency". So the answer should have a LIMIT K.

Another thing to check: in DuckDB, the array_agg function with ORDER BY is supported. Yes, in DuckDB, array_agg allows an ORDER BY clause.

For example: array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) will return the activities in the order of timestamp.

So the first step is correct.

Wait, but in some SQL dialects, you need to use a window function or a subquery to get the order, but in DuckDB, array_agg with ORDER BY should work.

Let me test with a small example.

Suppose event_log has:

case_id | activity | timestamp
1       | A        | 2023-01-01
1       | B        | 2023-01-02
2       | B        | 2023-01-01
2       | A        | 2023-01-02

Then, for case_id 1, the sequence is [A, B], for case_id 2, [B, A].

So the array_agg would order by timestamp.

Yes.

So the query should work.

Another point: when grouping by the activity_sequence (array), DuckDB should handle it correctly.

Now, the problem says "Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants."

So the activity_sequence is the key for grouping.

In the variant_counts CTE, we group by activity_sequence.

Then, we order by case_count descending and take top K.

Then, get the case_ids that have activity_sequence in top_variants.

Finally, select the events from event_log where case_id is in that list.

So the query as written should work.

But let's check if the IN clause with a subquery is efficient. In DuckDB, it's probably okay.

Wait, the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So the final result is the events from the original log that are in the selected cases.

So the query would be correct.

But in DuckDB, when you do a subquery with IN, it's possible to use a join.

But for simplicity, the IN subquery approach is acceptable.

Wait, another thing: the problem says "the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)".

So the count is per variant.

Yes, the variant_counts CTE counts the number of cases (case_id) per variant.

So that's correct.

Now, possible issues:

1. The order of the array: is it possible that the array is not ordered correctly? In DuckDB, array_agg with ORDER BY should sort by the specified order.

Yes.

2. The LIMIT K: the problem says top K, so the query uses LIMIT K.

But in the problem statement, it's not specified what K is, so the answer should have K as a parameter. However, in the context of the problem, since it's a benchmark query, the user probably expects to write it with a placeholder for K (like 3).

But the problem says "top K", so the answer should have a LIMIT K.

Wait, the problem says "determine the top K variants", so the query must have a LIMIT K.

So the final answer would be a DuckDB query with K as a parameter.

Wait, but the problem says "the top K variants", so the answer is a query that uses LIMIT K.

Let me write the query.

But the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So the query is:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
selected_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants)
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM selected_cases)

But in DuckDB, the CTEs can be used as above.

Wait, but the problem says "the top K variants", so K is a number. For example, K=3.

But the problem statement says "top K", so the answer should have K as a parameter.

However, in the context of a benchmark, the user might want to specify K as a variable. But since the problem says "top K", the answer should use K.

But in some SQL dialects, you can't have a variable K in the query. But the problem says "construct a DuckDB SQL query", so the answer should have K as a literal number, but the problem says "top K", which implies that K is a parameter.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, the problem says "determine the top K variants". So in the query, we need to have a clause that picks the top K. In DuckDB, the LIMIT clause allows specifying a number, so the answer should have a LIMIT K where K is a number. But the problem states "top K", so the answer should have a placeholder for K.

But the problem is presented as a benchmark prompt, so perhaps the answer is expected to have a specific K, like 3. But the problem says "top K", so it's better to use K as a variable.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, it's part of the task description, not the actual query. So the user wants the query written with the structure that can take K (e.g., K=3).

But in the answer, since it's a DuckDB query, and K is a parameter, but in the problem statement it's written as "top K", the answer should use K as a variable.

Wait, but in SQL, you can't have a variable like K in the query unless it's a parameter. However, in the context of this problem, the answer is a static query that uses a placeholder for K. For example, in some benchmarks, they use a specific number, but here it's "top K", so the answer would have a LIMIT K.

But since the problem says "the top K variants", the answer should have the LIMIT clause with K.

I think the answer should have K as a number, but the problem says "K", so I'll use K as a placeholder.

Another thing: the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So the final part is to select events from event_log where case_id is in the selected cases.

Yes.

Wait, but in the selected_cases CTE, we select case_id from case_sequences where activity_sequence is in top_variants.

Then, the IN clause is correct.

Let me check if there's a more efficient way.

Alternative approach: Instead of using multiple CTEs, we can do it in a single query with window functions.

But the problem requires grouping by the sequence, which is an array.

Another idea: Use a window function to assign a row number per case_id's sequence.

Wait, but the problem needs to count the variants.

Hmm, the approach with CTEs seems straightforward.

Wait, but in DuckDB, when you group by an array, it's possible that the array is not hashable. Wait, no, in DuckDB, array types are hashable, so the grouping should work.

Let me think: in DuckDB, array_agg returns an array, and when you group by an array, it's considered as a single value.

Yes.

So the query should work.

So the final answer is the query as written above.

But in the problem statement, the user says "construct a DuckDB SQL query", so the answer should be the SQL code.

Let me write it with K as a parameter.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says "the top K variants", so the answer should have a LIMIT K.

So the query is:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants)
)

But in DuckDB, the subquery in the IN clause might be optimized, but this should work.

Wait, but the problem says "the top K variants by their frequency". So the order is by case_count descending.

Yes.

Another point: The problem says "Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants."

So the activity_sequence is the key.

Yes.

I think this query meets all the requirements.

Let me check if the array_agg is correctly ordered.

Yes, in DuckDB, array_agg with ORDER BY will sort by the specified column.

So the sequence per case is correct.

Yes.

So the final answer is this query.

But the problem says "the top K variants", so the answer uses K as a placeholder.

In some contexts, they might write it with a specific number, like 3, but since the problem says "top K", it's better to have K.

Wait, but the problem says "the top K variants", so the user expects the query to have a LIMIT K.

Yes.

So the answer is the query with K.

I think this should be correct.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to construct a DuckDB query that:
1. Extracts the ordered sequence of activities per `case_id` (sorted by `timestamp`).
2. Groups cases by their complete activity sequences to identify unique process variants.
3. Counts the number of cases per variant and identifies the top K variants by frequency.
4. Filters the original event log to return only events from cases that belong to these top K variants.

Here's the complete solution:

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants)
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`case_sequences` CTE**: For each `case_id`, we aggregate the `activity` column into an array sorted by `timestamp` using `array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`. This gives us the ordered sequence of activities per case.
   
2. **`variant_counts` CTE**: We count how many cases (`case_count`) correspond to each unique `activity_sequence` (process variant).

3. **`top_variants` CTE**: We order the variants by `case_count` in descending order and select the top K variants using `LIMIT K`.

4. **Final Query**: We filter the original `event_log` to include only events from cases (`case_id`) that match one of the top K variants. This is done using an `IN` subquery that checks for `case_id` in the list of cases belonging to the top variants.

This query efficiently handles all requirements: it correctly orders sequences, groups by variants, counts frequencies, identifies top K variants, and filters events from the relevant cases. The placeholder `K` allows the query to be adjusted for any desired top K value.
