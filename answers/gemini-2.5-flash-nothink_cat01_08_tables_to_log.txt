Here's the integrated event log suitable for process mining, derived from the provided tables.

**Assumptions Made:**
*   For "Items Picked" events, if an order has multiple line items with different `item_picking_date`s, each unique `item_picking_date` for that order results in a separate "Items Picked" event. If multiple items are picked at the exact same timestamp by the same picker, they are grouped into a single "Items Picked" event. If picked by different pickers at the same time, they are separate events.
*   The `delivery_note` from the `Delivery` table is included as an additional attribute for "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events.
*   The `invoice_amount` and `payment_method` are included as additional attributes for their respective events.
*   Resource names and roles are retrieved from the `Resources` table where available, otherwise the raw ID is used.
*   Events are ordered chronologically within each case ID.
