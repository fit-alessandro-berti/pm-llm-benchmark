Given the event log provided, we can infer the following about the business process:

1. **Main Sequence**: There is a primary sequence of activities from receiving an application (`RA`), validating the form (`VF`), assessing eligibility (`AE`), making an approval decision (`AD`), sending confirmation (`SC`), to archiving the case (`AC`).

2. **Loop for Missing Information**: There is a loop where missing information (`RMI`) can be requested multiple times, followed by re-validation (`VF`). This loop can happen any number of times or not at all.

Here is the process tree structure that captures this behavior:

```
+ (
    -> (
        'Receive Application (RA)',
        + (
            * (
                -> (
                    'Validate Form (VF)',
                    'Assess Eligibility (AE)'
                ),
                -> (
                    'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                    'Validate Form (VF)'
                )
            ),
            -> (
                'Approval Decision (AD)',
                -> (
                    'Send Confirmation (SC)',
                    'Archive Case (AC)'
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**
- `+` at the top level indicates that the entire process can run in parallel with some other unlisted activities or processes, if any.
- `->` denotes a sequence of activities that must occur in order.
- `*` indicates a loop where the validation and assessment (`VF` and `AE`) are followed by an optional request for missing information (`RMI`) and re-validation (`VF`). This loop can either:
  - Exit after validation and assessment, proceeding directly to approval, or
  - Go through the request for missing information and re-validation again.
- The main sequence ensures that after possibly multiple loops of information gathering, the process moves towards decision making (`AD`), confirmation (`SC`), and archiving (`AC`).

This structure reflects the observed behavior in the event log, capturing the sequential flow with the flexibility of looping for additional information requests, while also providing a clear path to process completion.
