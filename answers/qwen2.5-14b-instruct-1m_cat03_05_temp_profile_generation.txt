To construct a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process, we'll focus on a representative subset of activity pairs, ensuring that we capture the complexity introduced by multiple steps between activities. The times provided are estimated based on typical durations and standard deviations for each phase of the supply chain.

Here’s the dictionary representation:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (1, 0.5),  # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: ~1 day, with some variability.
    ('OP', 'RC'): (7, 2),    # Order Placement to Receive Components: ~7 days for shipping, with some variability.
    ('RC', 'QI'): (1, 0.5),  # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: ~1 day, with some variability.
    ('QI', 'CA'): (2, 1),    # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: ~2 days, with some variability.
    ('CA', 'PT'): (5, 2),    # Component Assembly to Product Testing: ~5 days, with some variability.
    ('PT', 'PK'): (1, 0.5),  # Product Testing to Packaging: ~1 day, with some variability.
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1, 0.5),  # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: ~1 day, with some variability.
    ('WS', 'DT'): (3, 1),    # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: ~3 days, with some variability.
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1, 0.5),  # Distribution to After-Sales Support: ~1 day, with some variability.
    
    ('SS', 'QI'): (8, 3),    # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection: ~8 days, with some variability.
    ('QI', 'DT'): (8, 3),    # Quality Inspection to Distribution: ~8 days, with some variability.
    ('SS', 'PT'): (10, 4),   # Supplier Selection to Product Testing: ~10 days, with some variability.
    ('PT', 'AS'): (2, 1),    # Product Testing to After-Sales Support: ~2 days, with some variability.
    ('SS', 'PK'): (9, 4),    # Supplier Selection to Packaging: ~9 days, with some variability.
    ('PK', 'AS'): (4, 2),    # Packaging to After-Sales Support: ~4 days, with some variability.
    ('SS', 'WS'): (10, 5),   # Supplier Selection to Warehouse Storage: ~10 days, with some variability.
    ('WS', 'AS'): (4, 2),    # Warehouse Storage to After-Sales Support: ~4 days, with some variability.
    
    ('OP', 'PT'): (8, 3),    # Order Placement to Product Testing: ~8 days, with some variability.
    ('OP', 'WS'): (9, 4),    # Order Placement to Warehouse Storage: ~9 days, with some variability.
    ('OP', 'AS'): (10, 5),   # Order Placement to After-Sales Support: ~10 days, with some variability.
    
    ('RC', 'WS'): (4, 2),    # Receive Components to Warehouse Storage: ~4 days, with some variability.
    ('RC', 'AS'): (5, 2),    # Receive Components to After-Sales Support: ~5 days, with some variability.
    
    ('CA', 'WS'): (6, 2),    # Component Assembly to Warehouse Storage: ~6 days, with some variability.
    ('CA', 'AS'): (7, 3),    # Component Assembly to After-Sales Support: ~7 days, with some variability.
    
    ('PT', 'WS'): (2, 1),    # Product Testing to Warehouse Storage: ~2 days, with some variability.
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Immediate Successions**: Directly connected activities, like `('SS', 'OP')`, `('OP', 'RC')`, etc., are estimated based on typical lead times.
- **Indirect Successions**: Pairs like `('SS', 'QI')`, `('QI', 'DT')`, and `('SS', 'WS')` are estimated based on the sum of intermediate steps' durations and their associated variability.
- **Standard Deviations**: The standard deviations reflect typical variations in lead times due to factors like supplier reliability, inspection thoroughness, and distribution network efficiency.

This temporal profile should provide a solid basis for understanding temporal dependencies between activities in the supply chain, helping identify potential bottlenecks or deviations that may require attention.
