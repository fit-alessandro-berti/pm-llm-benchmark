<think>
First, I need to identify cases that have the sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' in direct succession, with no events in between. That means these three activities are consecutive in the case.

Then, among those cases, I need to find where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence is more than 5 days.

Finally, I have to exclude those cases entirely from the result. So, the output should be all events from cases that don't have this sequence or don't have the timing condition met.

The query should return events, not just case_ids. So I need to filter the event_log table to exclude events from cases that meet both conditions.

To do this in SQL, I probably need a subquery or a CTE to first find the case_ids that meet the criteria, and then use that to filter out those cases from the main event_log table.

Let me think about how to find the cases with the exact sequence in direct succession.

Since the activities must be consecutive, I need to look at the order of events within each case. I should probably order the events by timestamp within each case_id.

In DuckDB, I can use window functions or self-joins to find consecutive activities.

One way is to use the LEAD or LAG functions to check the next activity.

Since I need exactly three in a row, I might need to check for each event if it and the next two match the sequence.

I can assign a row number to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp, and then check for rows where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and the next row (row_number +1) is 'Create Order' and the one after (row_number +2) is 'Confirm Order'.

That sounds good.

So, first, I can create a CTE that adds a row number to each event per case, ordered by timestamp.

Something like:

WITH ranked_events AS (

SELECT 

case_id,

activity,

timestamp,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn

FROM event_log

)

Now, in this ranked_events, I can find where for a given row, activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and the activity at rn+1 = 'Create Order', and activity at rn+2 = 'Confirm Order'.

But to access rn+1 and rn+2, I need to join the table to itself or use window functions.

I can use the LEAD function.

LEAD can get the next rows.

So, in the CTE, I can add LEAD columns.

WITH ranked_events AS (

SELECT 

case_id,

activity,

timestamp,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn,

LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity1,

LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity2,

LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp2  -- I need the timestamp for 'Confirm Order'

FROM event_log

)

For the sequence, I need the timestamp of 'Confirm Order', which is two steps ahead, but only if the activities match.

In this CTE, I have for each row, the activity and the next two activities.

So, I can filter where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order' AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'.

This will give me the rows where the sequence starts.

But I also need the timestamp of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' to calculate the time difference.

In this setup, when activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next_activity1 is 'Create Order', and next_activity2 is 'Confirm Order'.

But the timestamp for 'Create Order' is not directly here. The LEAD is on activity and timestamp, but LEAD(timestamp,1) would be the timestamp of the next event, which is 'Create Order' in this case, and LEAD(timestamp,2) is the timestamp of 'Confirm Order'.

I have LEAD(timestamp,2) as next_timestamp2, which would be the timestamp of the event two steps ahead, i.e., 'Confirm Order'.

But I also need the timestamp of 'Create Order', which is the event at rn+1.

So, I should add LEAD(timestamp,1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp1

When I have a row where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then:

- The current timestamp is for 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

- next_timestamp1 is for the next event, which should be 'Create Order'

- next_timestamp2 is for the event after next, which should be 'Confirm Order'

Yes.

So, in the filter, when activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order' AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order', then the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is next_timestamp2 - next_timestamp1.

'Create Order' timestamp is next_timestamp1, 'Confirm Order' timestamp is next_timestamp2.

So the time difference is next_timestamp2 - next_timestamp1.

I need this difference to be more than 5 days.

Timestamps are datetime, so I need to compute the difference in days.

In DuckDB, I can subtract timestamps to get an interval, and then extract the days or compare.

DuckDB supports interval arithmetic.

I can do (next_timestamp2 - next_timestamp1) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

I think that should work.

First, find the cases where there exists such a sequence with the time condition.

In the CTE, when I filter for the starting activity with the conditions, I get rows, but I need the case_ids.

For each such row that satisfies the activity sequence and the time difference > 5 days, that case has the problematic sequence.

The condition is that the sequence exists with the time condition.

Even if there are multiple such sequences in a case, as long as one meets the criteria, the whole case should be excluded.

The prompt says: "identifies any case that contains the following sequence", and "among those cases", so it's per case, if the case has at least one such sequence with the time condition.

In the filter I described, when I find a row where the sequence starts and time >5 days, that implies the case has such a sequence.

I can select distinct case_id from those rows.

Define a CTE for the sequence detection.

WITH ranked_events AS (

SELECT 

case_id,

activity,

timestamp,

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn,

LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act1,

LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act2,

LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts1,

LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts2

FROM event_log

),

sequence_starts AS (

SELECT 

case_id,

next_ts1 AS create_order_ts,  -- timestamp of 'Create Order'

next_ts2 AS confirm_order_ts   -- timestamp of 'Confirm Order'

FROM ranked_events

WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'

AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'

AND (next_ts2 - next_ts1) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

)

In this sequence_starts, I have case_ids where the sequence starts and the time difference is more than 5 days.

Note that next_ts2 - next_ts1 is the difference between 'Confirm Order' and 'Create Order', which is correct.

This gives me the case_ids that have at least one such sequence meeting the time condition.

In the WHERE clause, I'm filtering for rows where the sequence is present and time >5 days, so for each such row, the case_id is problematic.

A case might have multiple starting points, but I just need the distinct case_ids.

So, from sequence_starts, I can select distinct case_id.

Define bad_cases as:

bad_cases AS (

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM sequence_starts

)

In the above, sequence_starts already has the case_ids where the condition is met for at least that starting point.

Since I'm selecting case_id in sequence_starts only when the condition is true, and a case might appear multiple times if there are multiple sequences, but DISTINCT will handle it.

I can add DISTINCT in the CTE or later.

Now, the bad_cases are those that have at least one such sequence with time >5 days.

I need to exclude events from these bad_cases.

So, the final query should select from event_log where case_id NOT IN (select case_id from bad_cases)

More precisely:

SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (

SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases

)

But I need to define bad_cases.

I can do it in one query.

Let me write the full CTE.

WITH ranked_events AS (

SELECT 

case_id,

activity,

timestamp,

LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act1,

LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act2,

LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts1,

LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts2

FROM event_log

),

bad_sequence AS (

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM ranked_events

WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'

AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'

AND (next_ts2 - next_ts1) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

)

SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_sequence)

In the bad_sequence CTE, I'm selecting distinct case_id where the condition is met.

In the WHERE clause of bad_sequence, I'm filtering rows where the sequence starts and time >5 days, and then taking distinct case_id.

That should give me all case_ids that have at least one such sequence.

Then, exclude those from the event_log.

The prompt says: "return all events from cases that do not meet the above criteria."

And the criteria is: cases that have the sequence and the time condition.

In my query, bad_sequence captures exactly those cases.

In the ranked_events CTE, I didn't need the row_number, since LEAD handles the ordering.

I used LEAD directly without row_number, which is fine, because LEAD is based on the order.

I assumed that the timestamps are unique and ordered correctly within a case. The prompt says to order by timestamp, so it should be fine.

What if there are multiple events with the same timestamp? But probably assuming timestamps are unique or the order is correctly handled by the OVER clause.

In DuckDB, the OVER clause with ORDER BY should handle the ordering.

The sequence must be in direct succession with no events in between, which is ensured by the LEAD function, as it looks at the immediate next rows in order.

The time difference is between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence, which is correct.

In the bad_sequence, I'm using next_ts2 - next_ts1, which is confirm_order_ts - create_order_ts, and it should be positive since timestamps are ordered.

In the condition (next_ts2 - next_ts1) > INTERVAL '5' DAY, this should work in DuckDB.

I think DuckDB supports interval literals.

To be safe, I can use DATEDIFF or something, but INTERVAL should be fine.

Now, the final output should be all events except those in bad cases.

The prompt says: "Please ensure proper grouping, ordering, and filtering so that the result set consists solely of events from the cases that are not filtered out."

It doesn't specify any particular order for the output, so probably just return the events as is, or perhaps in some order, but since it's not specified, I can leave it without ORDER BY, or maybe order by case_id and timestamp for neatness, but not necessary.

To make it consistent, perhaps I should order the output by case_id and timestamp.

But the prompt doesn't specify, so maybe not needed.

In the exclusion, it's based on the case level, so the output is a subset of events.

Now, one thing: in the bad_sequence CTE, I'm selecting case_id where the sequence exists with time >5 days.

But the prompt says: first identify cases with the sequence, then among those, refine to time >5 days.

In my query, I'm directly finding cases where there is a sequence with time >5 days.

Which is equivalent, because if a case has the sequence but no instance with time >5 days, it shouldn't be excluded.

The prompt says: "among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine to only those where the time elapsed... is more than 5 days."

Let's read carefully.

"1. Identifies any case that contains the following sequence..."

"2. Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days."

Important: "of that sequence"

In my current approach, I'm checking for each potential sequence instance whether the time >5 days.

But a case might have multiple instances of the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'.

The condition is: if a case has at least one such sequence where time >5 days, exclude it.

The phrasing: "the time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence"

It might be interpreted as for each sequence instance.

But since we're excluding the whole case if it has such a sequence with the condition.

In my query, it's correct.

Suppose a case has two sequences: one with time <5 days and one with time >5 days. Then, since it has a sequence with time >5 days, it should be excluded.

In my query, since I'm checking where the sequence exists and time >5 days, and taking case_id, it will capture that case.

If a case has the sequence but all instances have time <=5 days, it should not be excluded.

In my query, only if there is at least one row where the condition is true, it will be in bad_sequence.

Yes.

Now, another point: in the time difference, it's specifically for "that sequence", meaning for the sequence we're considering.

In my LEAD approach, I'm ensuring that for the specific triple, the time between the second and third is >5 days.

Yes.

Now, what if the 'Confirm Order' timestamp is not defined? For example, if there isn't a third event, LEAD might return NULL.

In the LEAD function, if there is no row, it returns NULL.

So, in the WHERE clause, when I do next_act2 = 'Confirm Order', if next_act2 is NULL, it won't equal 'Confirm Order', so it will be filtered out, which is correct.

Similarly for next_ts2 and next_ts1.

And in the time difference, if next_ts2 or next_ts1 is NULL, but since I'm checking next_act1 and next_act2 are not NULL implicitly by comparing to strings, and in SQL, NULL = 'string' is not true, so it should be fine.

In the condition AND next_act1 = 'Create Order' AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order', if next_act1 or next_act2 is NULL, the equality will be false or unknown, so it won't satisfy the WHERE clause.

Similarly, for the timestamp difference, if somehow they are NULL, but they shouldn't be if the activities are set.

But to be safe, perhaps I should ensure that next_ts1 and next_ts2 are not NULL, but it's probably redundant.

Now, the final query.

I think I can write it as above.

In the CTE, I have ranked_events with unnecessary columns, but it's fine.

I can do it without the intermediate CTE for sequence_starts.

In my earlier sketch, I have:

WITH ranked_events AS (...),

bad_sequence AS (

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM ranked_events

WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'

AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'

AND (next_ts2 - next_ts1) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

)

Then, SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_sequence)

To make it a single query, I can use a subquery.

But CTE is fine in DuckDB.

Now, the prompt asks to return all events, so SELECT * FROM event_log with the filter.

I think this should work.

The exclusion is only for cases that have both the sequence and the timing condition.

In my query, bad_sequence only includes cases with the sequence and timing.

Then NOT IN excludes those.

What if there are cases with no events or something, but probably not an issue.

I think this covers it.

Let me write the query cleanly.
