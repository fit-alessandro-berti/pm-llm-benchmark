### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Existence Constraints:**
   - **ManualReview**: Ensures that the `ManualReview` activity exists in the process to allow for closer scrutiny of certain decisions.
   - **BiasMitigationCheck**: Adds an activity specifically designed to check for bias before making decisions.
   - **CheckApplicantRace**: Adds an activity to check sensitive attributes like applicant race.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **Approve_Minority** and **Reject_Minority** with **ManualReview**: Ensures that any decision involving minority applicants is always accompanied by a manual review to ensure fairness. This helps mitigate bias by introducing a review step that can catch and correct biased decisions.

3. **Response Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace** to **BiasMitigationCheck**: Ensures that a `BiasMitigationCheck` is performed immediately after checking sensitive attributes, preventing immediate biased decisions.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace** to **BiasMitigationCheck**: Ensures that a `BiasMitigationCheck` always follows checking sensitive attributes, reinforcing the mitigation step.

5. **Non-Succession Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace** to **Approve** / **Reject**: Prevents immediate succession from checking sensitive attributes to making a decision, reducing the risk of biased decisions.

6. **Non-Chain Succession Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace** to **BiasMitigationCheck**: Ensures that the `BiasMitigationCheck` activity must occur within the process after sensitive attributes are checked, adding an extra layer of fairness.

These constraints collectively work to mitigate bias in the loan application process by ensuring that sensitive attributes are not used to directly influence decision-making without proper checks and balances. This promotes fairness and consistency in handling loan applications.
