Below is one reasonable transformation of the raw system log into a processmining event log. In this version we have assumed that a “case” is defined by the subject of work – for example, working on a particular document, reviewing an email, annotating a PDF, or editing a spreadsheet. In our interpretation each unique window (or file) corresponds to one case. Furthermore, we “lift” the lowlevel actions (FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, etc.) into standardized, higherlevel activity names such as “Open …”, “Edit …”, “Save …”, “Reply Email,” etc. Note that even when work on the same file is interrupted by a context switch (for example, switching from Document1.docx to work on email and then back again) we treat all events on that file as belonging to one case.

Below is the final event log table (each row shows a case ID, a standardized activity name, and the original timestamp):

Explanation of the Transformation Logic:

1. Case Identification:
   • We grouped events by the Window attribute (or file name) because each document, email, PDF, or spreadsheet represents a distinct piece of work. For example, all events on “Document1.docx” are assigned to Case “Document1”, while events on “Quarterly_Report.docx” are grouped as Case “Quarterly_Report.”
   • The email-related actions (from Google Chrome) were grouped into a case named “Email_AnnualMeeting” based on the email’s subject (inferred from “Open Email about Annual Meeting”) and the following reply/send events.
   • Similar reasoning was applied for the PDF (Report_Draft.pdf  Case “Report_Draft_PDF”) and the spreadsheet (Budget_2024.xlsx  Case “Budget_2024”).

2. Activity Naming:
   • The raw actions (FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, etc.) have been mapped to higherlevel process steps. For example, a FOCUS event on a document becomes “Open …” or “Resume …” if it appears later in the session. TYPING events on a document were aggregated into “Edit …” events.
   • Likewise for email actions: clicking to open an email, scrolling, replying, composing, and finally sending were translated into “Open Email (Annual Meeting)”, “Review Email”, “Reply Email Initiated”, “Compose Email Reply”, and “Send Email.”
   • For Acrobat, SCROLL and HIGHLIGHT became “Review PDF Document” and “Annotate PDF.”

3. Coherent Narrative:
   • Even though the user switched between tasks (as indicated by SWITCH events), we have omitted explicit SWITCH rows (since they merely signal context changes) and integrated the work into each case’s narrative.
   • The resulting event log now tells a clear story of the user’s work sessions: starting with opening documents, making changes, saving, and eventually closing them; handling an email conversation; reviewing and annotating a PDF; and editing a spreadsheet.

This event log is now well suited to be imported into standard process mining tools for further analysis.
