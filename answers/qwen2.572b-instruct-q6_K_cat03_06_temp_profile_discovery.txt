Certainly! To generate a temporal profile, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between all pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in the process variants. Given the complexity of the data, I'll outline the steps and then provide a Python script to compute the temporal profile.

### Steps:
1. **Parse the Process Variants**: Extract the sequences of activities and their frequencies.
2. **Generate All Pairs**: For each variant, generate all pairs of activities that eventually follow each other.
3. **Calculate Average and Standard Deviation**: For each pair, calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between them based on the performance data.

### Python Script:
```python
import numpy as np

# Process variants data
variants = [

### Explanation:
1. **Data Parsing**: The `variants` list contains tuples of process variants, their frequencies, and total performance times.
2. **Pair Generation**: The `generate_pairs` function generates all pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in a variant.
3. **Time Calculation**: For each pair, we store the time between them based on the performance data divided by the frequency.
4. **Average and Standard Deviation**: We use NumPy to calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair.
5. **Output**: The temporal profile is printed out as a dictionary of pairs with their average and standard deviation.

This script will generate the temporal profile for your process based on the given variants and performance data.
