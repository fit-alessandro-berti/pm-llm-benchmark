The visualization is a Business Process Diagram (BPD), likely created using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. It depicts a workflow spanning four departments or roles: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. The process begins on a Monday morning in the Sales department.

**Here's a breakdown of the process:**

**1. Sales:**

*   **Start:** The process starts with a clock icon, suggesting a scheduled or time-triggered event, specifically Monday morning.
*   **Order Verification:** The process begins with a check for order completeness.
*   **Customer Verification:** It checks the customer's order. If the customer is not in the database, a new customer record is added. It then checks if the customer is already in the database.
*   **Order Details:** Then, the order details are sent to the database.
*   **Order Details Transfer:** Order details are then sent to the Production and Procurement departments (indicated by dotted lines).
*   **Order Confirmation:** After the order is made, order details are sent.
*   **Invoice:** Finally, a draft invoice is created.

**2. Production:**

*   **Order Arrival:** Receives order details from Sales.
*   **Planning:** The process continues with production planning.
*   **Material Check:** The process checks the materials to see if the materials are faulty. If the materials are faulty, this process sends order details to procurement.
*   **Manufacturing:** Once the production planning is done, the product manufacturing process is initiated.
*   **Completion:** After the process of manufacturing is complete, a "product complete" signal is created. This signal goes to Warehouse.

**3. Procurement:**

*   **Order Details Arrival:** Receives order details from Sales.
*   **Material Compensation Subprocess:** It contains the order details.
*   **Material Order:** The department then orders materials
*   **Material Check:** The department then checks if the materials are ok. If there is a problem with materials, the process returns the material.
*   **Order Cancellation:** If the order has any problems, the order will be cancelled.

**4. Warehouse:**

*   **Product Completion:** The process starts with product completion.
*   **Product Send:** Once the product is complete, a "send product" activity takes place.
*   **Product Sent:** The process ends with a "product sent" signal.

**Overall Structure:**

The diagram utilizes swimlanes to visually separate the activities performed by different departments. The solid lines represent the flow of activities within each department, while the dashed lines indicate messages (e.g., order details) or data transfer between departments. The use of various BPMN elements like start and end events, tasks, gateways (diamond shapes for decision-making), and subprocesses makes it easy to understand the complete workflow. The use of swimlanes (Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse) and the linking of events clearly shows the interactions between departments in a streamlined process.
