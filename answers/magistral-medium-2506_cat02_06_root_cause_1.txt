### Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

#### 1. Identifying Cases with Longer Resolution Times
First, let's calculate the total resolution time for each case by computing the time difference between the "Receive Ticket" and "Close Ticket" timestamps:

| Case ID | Receive Ticket        | Close Ticket             | Total Duration (Hours) |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00      | 2024-03-01 10:15         | 2.25                   |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05      | 2024-03-02 09:15         | 25.17                  |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10      | 2024-03-01 09:30         | 1.33                   |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20      | 2024-03-02 08:30         | 24.17                  |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25      | 2024-03-03 09:30         | 49.17                  |

From this table, we can see that:
- **Cases 102, 104, and 105** have significantly longer resolution times (25+ hours) compared to **Cases 101 and 103**, which were resolved within 2.5 hours or less.
- **Case 105** stands out with a duration of nearly 49 hours, which is an extreme outlier.

#### 2. Potential Root Causes of Delays
Now, let's analyze the event logs for the delayed cases to identify patterns:

##### Case 102:
- Received at 08:05, closed at 09:15 the next day (~25 hours).
- Key observations:
  - Escalated to Level-2 at 11:30 (after ~3.5 hours from receipt).
  - Investigation by Level-2 started at 14:00 (2.5 hours after escalation).
  - Resolution took until 09:00 the next day (~19 hours after investigation started).
  - **Possible bottlenecks**:
    - Long time between escalation and investigation (2.5 hours).
    - Extremely long resolution phase (~19 hours).

##### Case 104:
- Received at 08:20, closed at 08:30 the next day (~24 hours).
- Key observations:
  - Triage took 40 minutes.
  - Assignment to Level-1 took 30 minutes after triage.
  - Investigation started at 13:00 (after ~3.5 hours of waiting since assignment).
  - Resolution took until 08:00 the next day (~19 hours after investigation started).
  - **Possible bottlenecks**:
    - Long wait time between assignment and investigation (~3.5 hours).
    - Long resolution phase (~19 hours).

##### Case 105:
- Received at 08:25, closed at 09:30 two days later (~49 hours).
- Key observations:
  - Escalated to Level-2 at 10:00 (after ~1.5 hours from receipt).
  - Investigation by Level-2 only started at 14:00 the next day (~28 hours after escalation!).
  - Resolution took until 09:00 the following day (~19 hours after investigation started).
  - **Possible bottlenecks**:
    - Extremely long wait time between escalation and investigation (~28 hours).
    - Resolution phase was also long (~19 hours).

##### Common Patterns in Delayed Cases:
1. **Escalation to Level-2**:
   - Cases 102 and 105 were escalated to Level-2, and both had long resolution times.
   - Case 104 was not escalated but still had a long wait time between assignment and investigation.

2. **Long Wait Times Between Activities**:
   - Significant delays between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" (e.g., Case 104: 3.5 hours, Case 102: 2.5 hours after escalation).
   - Extremely long wait time for Case 105 between escalation and investigation (~28 hours).

3. **Long Resolution Phases**:
   - In delayed cases, the time between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" is very long (~19 hours for Cases 102, 104, and 105). This suggests that once Level-2 gets involved, resolution takes much longer.

4. **No Escalation in Case 104, but Still Delayed**:
   - Even without escalation, Case 104 had a long wait time between assignment and investigation, and a long resolution phase. This suggests that even Level-1 tickets can suffer from delays if not handled promptly.

#### 3. Root Causes and Recommendations

**Root Causes:**
1. **Escalation Delays**:
   - Escalation to Level-2 agents seems to introduce significant delays, especially in the handoff (e.g., 28 hours for Case 105 to start investigation after escalation).
   - This suggests potential bottlenecks in Level-2 agent availability or prioritization.

2. **Long Wait Times Before Investigation**:
   - There are noticeable gaps between assignment and investigation. For example:
     - Case 104: 3.5 hours between assignment and investigation.
     - Case 105: 28 hours between escalation and investigation.
   - This suggests that agents (both Level-1 and Level-2) may not be starting investigations promptly after assignment.

3. **Long Resolution Times After Investigation**:
   - For Cases 102, 104, and 105, the time between investigation and resolution is ~19 hours. This is much longer than Cases 101 and 103 (~1 hour or less).
   - This suggests that Level-2 tickets (or complex tickets) take much longer to resolve, possibly due to:
     - Complexity of the issue requiring deeper analysis.
     - External dependencies (e.g., waiting for other teams or systems).
     - Lack of resources or expertise in Level-2.

4. **Potential Inefficiencies in Triage or Assignment**:
   - Some tickets may not be correctly triaged or assigned, leading to unnecessary escalations or delays in routing to the right team.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Reduce Escalation Delays**:
   - Improve handoff processes between Level-1 and Level-2 agents. For example:
     - Automatically notify Level-2 agents when a ticket is escalated.
     - Set SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for Level-2 to start investigation within a certain time (e.g., within 2 hours of escalation).
   - Ensure Level-2 agents have sufficient capacity to handle escalated tickets promptly.

2. **Minimize Wait Times Between Assignment and Investigation**:
   - Monitor and reduce the time between assignment and investigation. Possible actions:
     - Implement a policy that investigations must start within X hours of assignment (e.g., within 1 hour for Level-1, 2 hours for Level-2).
     - Provide incentives or performance metrics for agents to start investigations promptly.
     - Use a queue system that prioritizes older uninvestigated tickets.

3. **Analyze and Optimize Resolution Phases for Complex Tickets**:
   - For tickets that involve Level-2 or take longer to resolve:
     - Identify common patterns in these tickets (e.g., specific issue types, products, or customer segments).
     - Provide targeted training or resources for Level-2 agents to resolve these cases faster.
     - Consider breaking down complex issues into smaller tasks or involving additional experts earlier.

4. **Improve Triage and Assignment Process**:
   - Ensure tickets are correctly triaged to avoid unnecessary escalations.
   - Use historical data to predict which tickets are likely to require escalation and route them directly to Level-2 if appropriate.

5. **Automate or Streamline Workflows**:
   - Introduce automation for routine steps (e.g., auto-assignment based on ticket type).
   - Use chatbots or AI to assist in initial triage and investigation to reduce manual effort.

6. **Monitor and Track Bottlenecks**:
   - Continuously monitor time gaps between activities (e.g., assignment to investigation, escalation to investigation).
   - Set up alerts for tickets that exceed expected time thresholds for each step.

7. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Ensure there are enough Level-1 and Level-2 agents to handle the workload, especially during peak times.
   - Consider dynamic staffing (e.g., more Level-2 agents during high-escalation periods).

### Summary of Findings:
- Cases with escalations (102, 105) or long wait times between activities (104) had significantly longer resolution times.
- Key bottlenecks: delays in investigation start after assignment/escalation, and long resolution phases for complex tickets.
- Recommendations focus on reducing handoff delays, improving agent responsiveness, optimizing resource allocation, and streamlining workflows.
