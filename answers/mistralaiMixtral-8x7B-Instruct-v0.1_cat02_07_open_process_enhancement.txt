 Process enhancement is a concept in process mining that refers to the improvement and optimization of business processes using process mining techniques. It involves analyzing event logs generated by information systems to gain insights into the current state of processes, identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and deviations from the desired process model, and suggesting improvements to increase process efficiency, effectiveness, and compliance.

Process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking in the following ways:

1. Process Discovery: Process discovery is a process mining technique that involves creating a process model based on the event logs generated by information systems. It aims to provide a visual representation of the actual process flow, including all variants and deviations. Process discovery differs from process enhancement as it focuses on creating a process model from event logs, while process enhancement aims to improve and optimize the existing process model.
2. Conformance Checking: Conformance checking is a process mining technique that involves comparing the event logs generated by information systems with a predefined process model to identify deviations and non-compliance. It aims to ensure that the actual process flow adheres to the predefined process model and identify areas for improvement. Conformance checking differs from process enhancement as it focuses on identifying deviations and non-compliance, while process enhancement aims to improve and optimize the existing process model.

In summary, process enhancement is a process mining technique that aims to improve and optimize the existing process model using event logs generated by information systems. It differs from process discovery, which focuses on creating a process model from event logs, and conformance checking, which focuses on identifying deviations and non-compliance from a predefined process model. Process enhancement combines the insights gained from process discovery and conformance checking to provide suggestions for process improvement and optimization.
