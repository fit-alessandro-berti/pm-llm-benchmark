**Identification of Bias:**  
The event log for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits bias. This bias manifests through systematic score adjustments and differential treatment based on the `CommunityGroup` attribute, which correlates with the `LocalResident` status.  

---

**How the Bias Manifests:**  

1. **Score Adjustments Based on Community Affiliation:**  
   - In Group B, applicants affiliated with the *Highland Civic Darts Club* receive a **+10 ScoreAdjustment** labeled as a "Community Boost" (e.g., U001 and U003).  
   - This adjustment directly increases their scores (e.g., U003’s score rises from 695 to 705), which crosses a critical threshold for approval. Without this boost, U003’s preliminary score (695) would likely result in rejection, as seen in Group A where no adjustments occur.  
   - In contrast, **Group A (Protected Group)** receives **no score adjustments**, even for identical preliminary scores (e.g., P001: 720 vs. U001: 720  730).  

2. **Disparate Impact on Final Decisions:**  
   - In Group B, the "Community Boost" leads to approvals for applicants with **lower initial scores** (e.g., U003: 695  705 approved vs. U002: 710 rejected).  
   - Group A lacks such adjustments, so decisions strictly follow the preliminary score. For example:  
     - P001 (720) is approved, but U001 (720  730) gains an *unfair advantage* through the boost.  
     - P002 (710) is rejected, while a Group B applicant with the same score (U002: 710) is also rejected. However, U003 (695  705) is approved due to the adjustment, whereas a hypothetical Group A applicant with 695 would be rejected.  

3. **Proxy Discrimination via `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup`:**  
   - The `LocalResident` attribute (TRUE for Group B) indirectly enables access to the "Community Boost," as only local residents are part of the *Highland Civic Darts Club*.  
   - This creates a feedback loop where local applicants receive preferential treatment, while non-locals (Group A) are excluded from adjustments, even if their qualifications (preliminary scores) are identical.

**Systematic Differences in Outcomes:**  
The bias leads to **two key disparities**:  
- **Approval Threshold Variability:** Group B applicants can be approved with lower initial scores (e.g., 695  705), while Group A applicants must meet higher fixed thresholds (e.g., 720).  
- **Arbitrary Advantage for Specific Communities:** The "Community Boost" privileges applicants from a specific group, which may correlate with protected attributes (e.g., geographic location or socioeconomic status).

**Conclusion:**  
The bias in Group B violates fairness principles by introducing **arbitrary preferential treatment** based on community affiliation. This creates an unlevel playing field where systemic advantages for certain groups lead to skewed approval rates, disadvantaging the Protected Group (Group A) and perpetuating inequitable outcomes.
