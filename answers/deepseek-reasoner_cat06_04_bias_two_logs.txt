**Identification of Bias and Explanation:**

The **Unprotected Group (Group B)** exhibits bias through systematic advantages tied to the `CommunityGroup` and `LocalResident` attributes, which influence score adjustments and final decisions. Here’s how this manifests:

---

### **1. Score Adjustments Favoring Group B**
- **Group B** applicants affiliated with the *Highland Civic Darts Club* receive a **+10 "Community Boost"** during scoring (e.g., U001 and U003). This adjustment directly increases their eligibility for approval.  
- **Group A** (Protected Group) has no `CommunityGroup` affiliations, so no such adjustments occur. Their scores remain unchanged throughout the process.

**Example of Disparity**:  
- **U003 (Group B)** starts with a preliminary score of **695** (below typical approval thresholds) but is boosted to **705** and approved.  
- **P002 (Group A)** has a higher preliminary score of **710** but is rejected due to no adjustments.  
This suggests Group B applicants benefit from lower effective approval thresholds.

---

### **2. LocalResident Status as a Proxy for Bias**
- All Group B applicants are `LocalResidents` (TRUE), while Group A applicants are non-local (FALSE). The `CommunityGroup` boost is **only available to locals**, indirectly tying residency to favorable outcomes.  
- This creates a systemic advantage for locals, disadvantaging non-locals (Group A) who cannot access the adjustment.

---

### **3. Impact on Final Decisions**
- **Group B Approval Pattern**:  
  - Applicants with scores **705** (after adjustments) are approved.  
  - Without adjustments, U003 (695) and U001 (720  730) would likely be rejected or require stricter scrutiny.  
- **Group A Approval Pattern**:  
  - Approval requires a **preliminary score 720** (no adjustments).  
  - P002 (710) is rejected despite being closer to the threshold than U003 (705).

This creates a **double standard**: Group B applicants are held to a lower effective threshold due to adjustments unavailable to Group A.

### **4. Legal and Ethical Implications**
- **Proxy Discrimination**: Using `LocalResident` status and `CommunityGroup` affiliation as decision factors may disproportionately exclude protected groups (e.g., non-locals) from fair evaluation.  
- **Disparate Impact**: Group A’s inability to access score adjustments creates unequal opportunities, violating fairness principles in automated decision-making systems.

**Conclusion**:  
The bias in **Group B**’s log arises from **score adjustments tied to community affiliation and residency**, which systematically advantage local applicants. This violates fairness by creating unequal eligibility criteria between groups. To mitigate this, adjustments should be audited for neutrality, and residency/community ties should not influence scoring unless justified by nondiscriminatory factors.
