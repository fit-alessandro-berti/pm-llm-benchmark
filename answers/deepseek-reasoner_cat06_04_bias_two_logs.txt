The event log for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits bias, primarily through the **ScoreAdjustment** mechanism tied to the **CommunityGroup** attribute. This bias systematically advantages certain applicants in Group B, leading to disparities in final decisions compared to Group A. Here's how the bias manifests:

### 1. **CommunityGroup-Driven Score Adjustments**
   - In Group B, applicants affiliated with the **Highland Civic Darts Club** (e.g., U001, U003) receive a **+10 "Community Boost"** during scoring. For example:
     - U003’s preliminary score of 695 is increased to 705, resulting in approval despite being below the apparent approval threshold (710+ in Group A).
     - U001’s score is raised from 720 to 730, reinforcing approval (though its initial score was already sufficient).
   - In contrast, **Group A (Protected Group)** has no CommunityGroup affiliations and receives **no adjustments**, even for identical preliminary scores (e.g., P001 and U001 both start at 720, but only U001 gets a boost).

### 2. **Impact on Final Decisions**
   - **Group A**: Approval/rejection aligns strictly with preliminary scores:
     - P002 (710) is rejected, while P001 (720) and P003 (740) are approved.
   - **Group B**: The +10 adjustment allows lower-scoring applicants to qualify:
     - U003 (adjusted to 705) is approved, whereas P002 (710 in Group A) is rejected. This creates a **disparity in outcomes for similar applicants** based on group membership.

### 3. **LocalResident as a Gatekeeper**
   - All Group B applicants are **LocalResidents**, which appears to be a prerequisite for CommunityGroup eligibility (only local residents can join the Highland Civic Darts Club). Group A applicants are **not local residents** and thus excluded from this advantage.

### 4. **Systemic Disadvantage for Group A**
   - The lack of CommunityGroup access and adjustments for Group A creates a **structural barrier**: 
     - Applicants in Group A must rely solely on their preliminary scores, while Group B applicants can "bridge the gap" with the +10 boost.
     - This violates fairness principles, as protected groups are often legally shielded from such indirect disadvantages tied to residency or community ties.

### Conclusion
The bias in Group B’s process manifests as **unfair preferential treatment** for local residents affiliated with a specific community group, systematically inflating their scores and increasing approval rates compared to Group A. This violates equity standards, as adjustments based on non-merit factors (CommunityGroup/LocalResident) create unequal opportunities for approval.
