 Based on the process variants provided for both the protected and unprotected groups, the main differences in treatment and process flows can be identified as follows:

1. Number of treatment attempts: The unprotected group has significantly more cases of multiple treatment attempts before achieving treatment success compared to the protected group. For example, the unprotected group has several process variants with treatment unsuccessful followed by further diagnosis and treatments before successful discharge. These scenarios (treatment unsuccessful) are less frequent in the protected group.

2. Additional diagnostic steps: The unprotected group has more instances of additional diagnostic steps, such as Expert Examination and Thorough Examination, compared to the protected group. These steps might indicate that the unprotected group receives more in-depth diagnostic tests prior to treatment.

3. Specific treatment process frequencies: The unprotected group has higher frequencies in several treatment process variants, especially the process with Expert Examination > Thorough Examination > Diagnosis > Treatment > Treatment successful > Discharge. This process is present more frequently in the unprotected group, suggesting a different treatment approach for this group that includes more thorough diagnostic and expert examination steps.

4. Different registration locations: Although both groups register at ER and FD, their frequencies in each registration location may vary. The protected group might have a different balance of registrations at ER and FD compared to the unprotected group, which could indicate different initial access or triage approaches.

5. Treatment times: The treatment times, as indicated by the performance values, vary between the protected and unprotected groups in specific process variants. For instance, the protected group has shorter performance times for the process variant Register at ER/FD > Examination > Diagnosis > Treatment > Treatment successful > Discharge, while the unprotected group has shorter performance times in other processes like the Register at FD > Expert Examination > Thorough Examination > Diagnosis > Treatment > Treatment successful > Discharge. These differences might result from distinct treatment practices or resource availability for each group.

Overall, there are multiple differences in the treatment process and practices between the protected and unprotected groups, including additional diagnostic steps, more frequent multiple treatment attempts, and different resource allocation as indicated by registration location frequencies and performance times.
