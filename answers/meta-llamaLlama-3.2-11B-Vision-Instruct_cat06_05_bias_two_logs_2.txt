After analyzing the two event logs, I have identified a bias in the hiring process.

**Group A (Protected Group):**

There is no indication of bias in the evaluation process for Group A. The scores and decisions are based solely on the candidate's performance and fit for the role.

**Group B (Unprotected Group):**
