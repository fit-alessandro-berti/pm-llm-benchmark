Here's the **updated DECLARE model** with **bias-mitigating constraints** added to enforce fairness in the loan application process. Each new constraint is introduced following the DECLARE format, and explanations are provided to justify how each constraint contributes to reducing potential discrimination.

###  Updated DECLARE Model with Bias Mitigation

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensures a fairness check exists in relevant traces
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure ManualReview coexists with any sensitive-group decision
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Female": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Female": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure BiasMitigationCheck follows sensitive attribute checks
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure BiasMitigationCheck happens before any FinalDecision
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        # Prevent direct coexistence of sensitive checks and final decisions
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonsuccession": {
        # Prevent direct succession from sensitive checks to decision
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

###  Rationale for Added Constraints

| Constraint | Activities Involved | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Existence** | `BiasMitigationCheck` | Ensures that every trace involving sensitive decisions includes a fairness check. |
| **Coexistence** | `Approve_Minority  ManualReview`, `Reject_Female  ManualReview`, etc. | Ensures that decisions for applicants from sensitive groups are always accompanied by a manual review, promoting consistency and accountability. |
| **Response** | `CheckApplicantRace  BiasMitigationCheck`, `CheckApplicantGender  BiasMitigationCheck` | Enforces that after checking sensitive attributes, a fairness check must occur. |
| **Succession** | `BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision` | Ensures that no final decision can be made until a fairness check has been performed. |
| **Non-coexistence** | `CheckApplicantRace  FinalDecision`, `CheckApplicantGender  FinalDecision` | Prevents scenarios where sensitive attribute checks directly coexist with decisions without intervening checks. |
| **Non-succession** | `CheckApplicantRace  Reject`, `CheckApplicantGender  Approve`, etc. | Prohibits direct transitions from sensitive attribute checks to final decisions to avoid immediate bias. |

###  Summary

These added constraints enforce **fairness** by:
- Requiring **manual oversight** for decisions involving sensitive groups.
- Ensuring **bias mitigation checks** intervene between sensitive attribute checks and final decisions.
- Preventing **direct or immediate transitions** that could lead to discriminatory outcomes.

This approach aligns with principles of **algorithmic fairness** and helps ensure that the loan application process remains **transparent**, **accountable**, and **non-discriminatory**.
