1) **Example of an “allowed but wrong” trace**

```
Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Ship_Order  Package_Items  Authorize_Payment  Close_Order
```

2) **Why the model accepts it, and why it’s wrong in the domain**

- In the given tree, after `Receive_Order` and `Check_Inventory`, the model can take the “successful” branch:
  - `successful_subtree = PARALLEL(Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order)`
- A **PARALLEL** (AND) block allows **any interleaving/order** of its children, as long as all of them occur once.  
  So executing `Ship_Order` **before** `Package_Items` and **before** `Authorize_Payment` is considered perfectly valid by the model.

- From an Order-to-Cash domain perspective, this is **not acceptable**: you cannot ship an order before the items are packaged, and (per the stated intended logic) shipping should not happen before payment authorization. The real process requires the *constraints*:
  - `Authorize_Payment` **before** `Package_Items`
  - `Package_Items` **before** `Ship_Order`

Because the model uses **PARALLEL** instead of a **SEQUENCE** for these steps, it is too permissive (“underfitting”) and fails to prohibit this logically incorrect behavior.
