### Identified Violating Cases
The following cases deviate from the normative process: **Case 2**, **Case 3**, and **Case 5**.  
Cases 1 and 4 conform to the expected flows (sufficient inventory for Case 1; insufficient inventory for Case 4).

### Explanation of Violations

#### Case 2
This case follows the sufficient inventory branch in terms of overall activities (Receive → Check → Authorize → Ship → Close) but violates the required sequencing by performing "Package items" *before* "Authorize payment". The normative description explicitly states that "Package items" should only occur *after* authorization, as "items must be prepared before they can be shipped" but only once payment is confirmed valid and approved following the inventory check. Authorizing payment before packaging "only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known," implying a strict order to avoid premature fulfillment actions. Here, packaging at 10:00 precedes authorization at 10:30, which could lead to wasted effort if payment fails. While the timestamps show logical progression otherwise (e.g., Check before Authorize, Ship after Package), this reversal contravenes the constraint that packaging must follow authorization.

#### Case 3
This case exhibits multiple violations, blending elements of both branches illogically and introducing forbidden actions. After "Check inventory" (at 09:20), it proceeds to "Authorize payment" (09:40), suggesting an assumption of sufficient inventory, but then shifts to "Cancel order" (10:00), which the description reserves exclusively for insufficient inventory scenarios—directly after the check, without intervening fulfillment steps. This creates an ambiguity in interpretation (e.g., could a post-check authorization be conditionally reversed?), but the description's branching logic implies no overlap: fulfillment activities like authorization should not precede cancellation. Compounding this, "Ship order" follows cancellation (at 10:30), which is explicitly prohibited as "it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as... shipping)" after cancellation. The description reinforces that shipping should "never" occur after cancellation, as the process must terminate the fulfillment path. "Close order" remains final, which aligns, but the prior deviations indicate a severe mishandling of the inventory-based decision point.

#### Case 5
This case attempts the sufficient inventory flow but skips "Package items" entirely, jumping from "Authorize payment" (10:30) directly to "Ship order" (11:00). The normative description mandates that "Package items" must occur *after* authorization and *before* shipping, as "items should be prepared for shipment" prior to any dispatch to ensure proper handling. Shipping without packaging violates the constraint that "Ship order" should only occur after packaging, potentially resulting in incomplete or damaged orders. While the sequence otherwise respects prerequisites (e.g., Check before Authorize, Close as final), the omission disrupts the "normal progression" of preparation steps, interpreting the description's emphasis on sequential fulfillment as non-negotiable for viability. This could stem from an operational shortcut, but it clearly deviates from the intended flow.
