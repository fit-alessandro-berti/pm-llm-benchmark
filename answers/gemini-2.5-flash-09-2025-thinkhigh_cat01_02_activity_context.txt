This analysis focuses on the recurring activities: **Verify Documents** and **Call Customer**, as their contextual meaning changes significantly across the different cases and within the flow of a single case.

## 1. Identified Activities and Contextual Differences

| Original Activity | Case ID | Contextual Difference Leading to Renaming |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Verify Documents** | C001, C002, C003 | Used for the *initial* check (pre-decision) and subsequently used for *re-verification* after new input (C001) or after an internal account modification (C003). |
| **Call Customer** | C001, C002, C003 | The purpose of the call changes drastically: requesting missing documentation (C001), clarifying account details (C002, initial), confirming actions taken (C002, second), or physically recalling a customer to a branch (C003). |
| **Adjust Account** | C002, C003 | Although the *reason* for the adjustment differs (clarification vs. correction), the technical activity remains the same internal execution. A slight refinement (Execution) will be used for consistency, but its meaning is largely singular. |

## 4. Justification of Naming Choices

### Activity: Verify Documents

The original name was too generic, failing to differentiate between the required initial check and subsequent checks triggered by exceptions or process deviations.

*   **Initial Document Validation:** Used for the first occurrence in all cases. This establishes the baseline verification step.
*   **Re-Validate Submitted Documentation (C001):** This specifically occurs *after* the customer provided missing documents, indicating a cyclical dependency (validation $\rightarrow$ failure $\rightarrow$ customer input $\rightarrow$ re-validation).
*   **Confirm Documentation Post-Adjustment (C003):** This specific re-verification happens *after* an internal system change (`Execute Internal Account Adjustment`), implying a necessary compliance step to ensure the documentation still matches the corrected account status.

### Activity: Call Customer

The context provided clearly showed that "Calling the Customer" was not a single activity type, but rather a mechanism used to achieve diverse process outcomes.

*   **Contact: Request Missing Information (C001):** The call is an active demand for data needed to progress the case.
*   **Contact: Clarify Account Discrepancy (C002):** The call is primarily for information gathering and troubleshooting.
*   **Contact: Notify/Confirm Changes (C002):** The call acts as a completion step, ensuring the customer is aware and confirming satisfaction before final approval.
*   **Contact: Recall Customer to Branch (C003):** This is a unique logistical action related to the branch context, not an information request or notification regarding the account status itself.

### Other Activities

*   **Initiate Request** was changed to **Receive Customer Request** to reflect the system's perspective (the start of the tracked process) rather than the customer's action.
*   **Adjust Account** was formalized to **Execute Internal Account Adjustment** to emphasize that this is a system-level administrative action taken by an agent.
*   **Approve Request** was changed to **Final Request Approval** to clearly mark it as the terminal state of the successful process path.
