-----------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN FLOW (happy-path)

(1) Start Event: “Invoice received by e-mail”   lane AP Clerk, data A  

(2) Task: “Check invoice for valid PO#” – AP Clerk  

(3) Exclusive Gateway G1: “PO# present?”  
- No  (3a) Task “Return invoice to supplier requesting PO / missing details” – AP Clerk  End Event “Invoice returned – process ends for this instance”.  
- Yes  continue  

(4) Task: “Log invoice in Accounting System” – AP Clerk  data A recorded  

(5) Task: “Forward invoice & PO to Purchasing Officer for receipt confirmation” – AP Clerk (system sends e-mail)  

(6) Task: “Verify goods/services received & compare invoice vs. PO” – Purchasing Officer  

(7) Exclusive Gateway G2: “Invoice matches PO & goods received?”  
- No  go to Exception Flow E1 (“Mismatch at Purchasing”)  
- Yes  (7a) Task: “Send confirmation e-mail to AP Clerk” – Purchasing Officer, produces C  

(8) Task: “Match invoice line-items to PO in system” – AP Clerk  

(9) Exclusive Gateway G3: “Line-item match OK?”  
- No  go to Exception Flow E2 (“Mismatch at AP Matching”)  
- Yes  (9a) Intermediate Message Event: “System requests Manager approval” – Accounting System  Manager  

(10) Task: “Review & approve invoice” – Department Manager  

(11) Exclusive Gateway G4: “Manager approved?”  
- No (Reject / Hold)  go to Exception Flow E3 (“Manager rejects/holds”)  
- Yes  (11a) Task: “Schedule invoice for next payment run” – AP Clerk  creates F  

(12) End Event: “Invoice queued for payment” (Process instance ends).  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
EXCEPTION / VARIATION FLOWS

E1. Mismatch at Purchasing (from G2-No)  
E1-1 Task: “Contact supplier or instruct AP Clerk to hold invoice” – Purchasing Officer; logs D  
E1-2 Inclusive Gateway G2a: “Discrepancy resolved?”  
• Yes  return to Step 8  
• No  Task “Escalate to AP Supervisor” – Purchasing Officer  follow E4  

E2. Mismatch at AP Matching (from G3-No)  
E2-1 Task: “E-mail Purchasing for clarification” – AP Clerk; logs D  
E2-2 Inclusive Gateway G3a: “Resolved quickly?”  
• Yes  return to Step 9 (re-evaluate)  
• No  Task “Escalate to AP Supervisor” – AP Clerk  E4  

E3. Manager Rejects / Holds (from G4-No)  
E3-1 Task: “Notify AP Clerk with reason” – Department Manager (system)  
E3-2 Task: “Investigate issue” – AP Clerk (may consult Purchasing)  
E3-3 Gateway G4a: “Issue resolved & Manager re-approves?”  
• Yes  return to Step 11 (approval)  
• No  Task “Reject invoice / return to supplier” – AP Clerk  End Event “Invoice rejected”.  

E4. Escalation to AP Supervisor (from E1 or E2)  
E4-1 Task: “Coordinate among AP, Purchasing, Supplier” – AP Supervisor  
E4-2 Parallel Gateway G5 (optional involvement):  
- Branch 1: “Obtain missing or corrected information from Supplier” – SRM  
- Branch 2: “Create retrospective PO or decide rejection” – AP Supervisor + Dept. Head  
E4-3 Gateway G5a: “Exception cleared?”  
• Yes  flow returns to Step 8 (if matching pending) or Step 10 (if already matched) as appropriate.  
• No  Task “Reject invoice / close case” – AP Supervisor  End Event “Invoice rejected”.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES / AMBIGUITIES

• Interviewees differ slightly on where the detailed line-item matching happens; model shows AP Clerk doing final system match after Purchasing’s receipt confirmation (majority view).  

• Some invoices for informally-contracted services arrive without any PO. Current policy (per AP Supervisor) is to create a retrospective PO or reject; this appears within Escalation flow E4.  

• System-generated e-mails (steps 5, 9) are modeled as tasks in the “Accounting System” lane for clarity.  

• Payment-run batching after Step 12 is out-of-scope for this model.
