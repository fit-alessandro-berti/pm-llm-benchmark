Here’s a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the global supply chain process, with estimated average times and standard deviations for pairs of activities that eventually follow each other. The values are based on realistic assumptions about supply chain dynamics (e.g., procurement lead times, manufacturing delays, testing variability, etc.):

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Procurement phase
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 14400),      # 1 day avg, 4h stdev (supplier selection to order placement)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),     # 7 days avg, 1 day stdev (supplier selection to component receipt)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (518400, 43200),     # 6 days avg, 12h stdev (order placement to component receipt)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (691200, 172800),    # 8 days avg, 2 days stdev (supplier selection to quality inspection)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (604800, 86400),     # 7 days avg, 1 day stdev (order placement to quality inspection)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),      # 1 day avg, 6h stdev (component receipt to quality inspection)

    # Manufacturing phase
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 14400),      # 12h avg, 4h stdev (quality inspection to assembly)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 43200),     # 2 days avg, 12h stdev (assembly to testing)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),     # 3 days avg, 1 day stdev (quality inspection to testing)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (259200, 86400),     # 3 days avg, 1 day stdev (assembly to packaging)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 21600),      # 1 day avg, 6h stdev (testing to packaging)

    # Distribution phase
    ('PK', 'WS'): (43200, 10800),      # 12h avg, 3h stdev (packaging to warehouse storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400),     # 2 days avg, 1 day stdev (warehouse storage to distribution)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (259200, 172800),    # 3 days avg, 2 days stdev (packaging to distribution)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200),    # 7 days avg, 3 days stdev (distribution to after-sales support)

    # Cross-phase pairs (longer delays)
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1209600, 259200),   # 14 days avg, 3 days stdev (supplier selection to assembly)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (1123200, 259200),   # 13 days avg, 3 days stdev (order placement to testing)
    ('RC', 'PK'): (604800, 172800),    # 7 days avg, 2 days stdev (component receipt to packaging)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (864000, 259200),    # 10 days avg, 3 days stdev (quality inspection to distribution)
    ('CA', 'AS'): (1209600, 432000),   # 14 days avg, 5 days stdev (assembly to after-sales support)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1814400, 432000),   # 21 days avg, 5 days stdev (supplier selection to distribution)
}
```

### **Key Assumptions and Rationale**:
1. **Procurement Phase**:
   - Supplier selection (`SS`) to order placement (`OP`) is quick (1 day) but varies due to negotiation delays.
   - Order placement (`OP`) to component receipt (`RC`) takes ~6 days (global shipping) with high variability (12h stdev).
   - Quality inspection (`QI`) after receipt (`RC`) is fast (1 day) but depends on batch size.

2. **Manufacturing Phase**:
   - Assembly (`CA`) to testing (`PT`) takes ~2 days (complex electronics) with variability due to testing bottlenecks.
   - Testing (`PT`) to packaging (`PK`) is quick (1 day) but may vary if retests are needed.

3. **Distribution Phase**:
   - Warehouse storage (`WS`) to distribution (`DT`) takes ~2 days (logistics coordination) but can vary (1 day stdev).
   - After-sales support (`AS`) starts ~7 days post-distribution (customer feedback/returns).

4. **Cross-Phase Pairs**:
   - Longer delays (e.g., `SS` to `CA`: 14 days) account for cumulative lead times.
   - High standard deviations (e.g., `SS` to `DT`: 5 days) reflect supply chain uncertainties (delays, customs, etc.).

### **Example Deviations (ZETA = 2)**:
- For `('OP', 'RC')` with `(518400, 43200)`:
  - **Lower bound**: `518400 - 2*43200 = 432000` (5 days).
  - **Upper bound**: `518400 + 2*43200 = 604800` (7 days).
  - A trace with `OP`  `RC` in **4 days** or **8 days** would flag a deviation.

This profile captures both **direct transitions** (e.g., `QI`  `CA`) and **long-range dependencies** (e.g., `SS`  `DT`), reflecting real-world supply chain complexity. Adjust `ZETA` based on tolerance for variability.
