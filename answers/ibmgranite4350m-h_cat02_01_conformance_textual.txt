To address your task, I will analyze each case from the provided event log against the guidelines outlined in the normative process description.

### Case Analysis:

1. **Case ID 1:**
   - Timestamp: 2023-10-05 09:00
   - Activity: Receive order

2. **Case ID 2:**
   - Timestamp: 2023-10-06 09:30
   - Activity: Check inventory

3. **Case ID 3:**
   - Timestamp: 2023-10-07 09:40
   - Activity: Authorize payment
   - Note: This case is the first in a sequence that includes authorization and then packaging.

4. **Case ID 4:**
   - Timestamp: 2023-10-08 09:20
   - Activity: Cancel order

5. **Case ID 5:**
   - Timestamp: 2023-10-09 10:30
   - Activity: Authorize payment
   - Note: This case is followed by authorization and then shipping.

### Violations Identified:

1. **Violation in Case 2:**  
   The normative process requires the authorizations to occur immediately after inventory check (Activity ID 2). However, there is no mention of any immediate actions following this step before proceeding to "Package items." This deviation from the norm indicates a violation.

2. **Violation in Case 3:**  
   - The activity sequence includes authorization and then packaging.
   - According to the process description, if inventory check reveals insufficient stock, it should proceed directly to cancellation (Activity ID 4). However, there is no indication that this step occurs before processing "Package items."

### Explanation of Violations:

- **Case 2** violates the normative process because it does not follow a clear and logical order for following activities in response to inventory check. The description suggests that after checking inventory, payment authorization should be performed.
  
- **Case 3** also has discrepancies; while it follows an appropriate sequence of operations before packaging (after authorization), there is no mention of any immediate or proper action taking place right after this step.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, Cases 2 and 3 in the event log deviate from the intended process flow. These cases do not follow the normative steps for inventory check, payment authorization, and packaging items before shipping. The resolution is to ensure that activities take precedence as specified by the normative description.
