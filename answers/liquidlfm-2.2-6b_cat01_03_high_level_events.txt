### High-Level Process Steps Aggregation from Manufacturer Event Log

#### 1. **Material Preparation**
- **Activities:**  
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet  
  - Scan barcode  
  - Place metal sheet on table  
  - Align metal sheet (perfect)  
  - Preheat metal sheet (200°C)

- **Rationale:**  
  These events collectively describe the setup and preparation phase for a metal component. They involve identifying, orienting, and conditionally heating the raw material, making this a foundational step focused on preparing the workpiece for processing. The cluster includes both material localization (retrieve, scan, place) and physical setup (align, preheat) tasks, which are essential for consistent welding and subsequent operations.

#### 2. **Welding**
- **Activities:**  
  - Pick up welding tool (Operator B or B+)  
  - Weld corner A (spot weld)  
  - Weld corner B (spot weld)  
  - Measure weld integrity (integrity scores 95 and 93)

- **Rationale:**  
  This phase identifies all actions directly involved in executing the welding process on a single component. The use of specific tools by operators and the consistency in weld type and integrity checks indicate this is a cohesive welding step. The inclusion of quality assessment (measuring integrity) supports the idea of a unified step that integrates engineering execution with quality control. The step is repeated for subsequent parts (B2), suggesting it is isolated to each Metal Sheet (M-045, M-046).

#### 3. **Component Finishing**
- **Activities:**  
  - Apply protective coating (Coating Type: Polyurethane)  
  - Dry coating (Heating Unit #2 at 120°C)  
  - Visual check (Passed by Operator C)

- **Rationale:**  
  The final stage addresses post-weld processing and quality verification. Applying a protective coating, curing it, and visual inspection are distinct yet tightly coupled actions ensuring the component’s durability and compliance. These steps collectively form the finishing phase, completing the component’s preparation for further use or packaging.

| **Material Preparation**| Retrieve raw metal sheet<br>Scan barcode<br>Place metal sheet on table | Sets up the raw material for processing<br>Include localization and orientation<br>Critical for consistent production |
| **Welding**           | Pick up welding tool<br>Weld corner A<br>Weld corner B<br>Measure weld integrity | Covers tool utilization, execution, and quality assessment of welding<br>Unified due to repeated logs (M-045, M-046) |

This aggregation distills the sequential, granular events into clear, actionable manufacturing stages. Each step is logically coherent, allowing for better process analysis, improved documentation, or system automation targeting specific phases. The grouping also facilitates modular updates (e.g., changing coating protocols only affects Component Finishing), enhancing maintainability and scalability of the workflow representation.
