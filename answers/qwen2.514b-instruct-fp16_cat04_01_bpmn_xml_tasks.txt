Based on the provided BPMN XML, here are the identified tasks in the process model. Note that BPMN elements like `bpmn:userTask`, `bpmn:exclusiveGateway`, and others represent different types of activities/tasks within a BPMN workflow:

1. Task with ID `id649-b9f1-5bfd6288b8be`
2. Gateway (exclusive) with ID `idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b` (Gateways, such as exclusive gateways, can act like decision points or branching points in a process flow, and are often visualized as diamonds)
3. Task with ID `id3fe498e9-097b-4628-96b0-639beba726c7`
4. Gateway (exclusive) with ID `idd371ddf5-0e93-4afa-bd26-49c2c4bc293e` 
5. Task with ID `idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2`
6. Gateway (exclusive) with ID `idd3814e0c-ae8b-41d6-b7a1-7c0e9385eb3e`

In this particular XML, some elements are gateways, which play a critical role in directing the flow of the process but aren't tasks per se. The user or service tasks are explicitly labeled as `bpmn:userTask` or similar task types.

Please note that for more precise identification of tasks, it would be necessary to have more explicit labels or descriptions associated with each ID within the XML structure you provided, if available in a complete document.
