Let's analyze the event logs for potential bias:

**Bias Identification**

In Group B (Unprotected Group), candidates with LocalBusinessLeadersClub affiliation receive:
1. A +5 point boost to their Cultural Fit score
2. Explicit score adjustment during the Cultural Fit and Final Interview stages

**Manifestation of Bias:**

Hiring Outcomes:
- Group A: 2/3 candidates hired (66.7% success rate)
- Group B: 2/3 candidates hired (66.7% success rate)

Key Bias Indicators:
1. Candidates with professional association (U001 and U003) received score boosts
2. Candidate without association (U002) did not receive any boost
3. Boosted candidates were more likely to be viewed favorably in final stages

**Implications:**

Fairness Concerns:
- Arbitrary advantage for network/connection-based candidates
- Potential systematic exclusion of candidates without professional associations
- Introduces non-merit-based criteria into hiring decision

**Potential Consequences:**
- Reduced diversity
