Key anomalies per case (time-order shown)

Case 1002  
• Activity “Issue Purchase Order” (2024-02-01 08:40) occurs **before** the corresponding purchase requisition is ever “Approved” (approval happens more than 23 hours **later**, 2024-02-03 08:00).  
 A purchase order is legally binding; issuing it without an approved requisition breaks the mandated three-way match policy and exposes the company to compliance/audit risk.

Case 1003  
• Event “Release Payment” (2024-02-08 11:00) precedes both:  
– receipt of the vendor’s invoice (2024-02-09 12:00), and  
– physical receipt of the goods (2024-02-10 13:00).  
 Payment has been made for an invoice that neither physically exists yet nor whose corresponding goods are verified — an internal-control failure that can result in paying for incorrect prices/quantities or even fraudulent invoices.

Case 1004  
• Goods are received (2024-02-06 09:00) **before** the purchase order is issued (2024-02-06 09:15).  
 Receipt implies an agreement (PO) should already be in place; receiving against a PO that is created afterwards compromises the ability to enforce quantities, prices, and delivery conditions, and disrupts downstream matching and accrual accounting.

No other cases or precise time stamps deviate from the standard P2P sequence.
