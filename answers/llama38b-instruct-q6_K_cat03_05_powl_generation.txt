Here is an example of how you can define a POWL (PARTIALLY ORDERED WORKFLOW LANGUAGE) model using `pm4py` for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the nodes of the POWL model
place_order = Transition(label="Place Order")
order_received = Transition(label="Order Received")
payment_processing = Transition(label="Payment Processing")
invoice_sent = Transition(label="Invoice Sent")
payment_approved = Transition(label="Payment Approved")
payment_rejected = Transition(label="Payment Rejected")

# Define the silent transitions
skip_payment_processing = SilentTransition()
skip_invoice_sent = SilentTransition()
skip_payment_approved = SilentTransition()

# Define the operator nodes (choice and loop)
choice_payment_processing = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[payment_processing, skip_payment_processing])
choice_invoice_sent = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[invoice_sent, skip_invoice_sent])
loop_payment_approval = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[payment_approved, payment_rejected])

# Define the main POWL model
purchase_to_pay = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[place_order, order_received, choice_payment_processing, loop_payment_approval, choice_invoice_sent])

# Set the partial order between nodes
purchase_to_pay.order.add_edge(place_order, order_received)
purchase_to_pay.order.add_edge(order_received, choice_payment_processing)
purchase_to_pay.order.add_edge(choice_payment_processing, loop_payment_approval)
purchase_to_pay.order.add_edge(loop_payment_approval, choice_invoice_sent)
```

This example defines a POWL model for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process that includes the following steps:

1. Place Order
2. Order Received
3. Payment Processing (choice: either execute or skip payment processing)
4. Loop between Payment Approved and Payment Rejected (until payment is approved or rejected)
5. Invoice Sent (choice: either execute or skip sending invoice)

The partial order between nodes is set as follows:

* Place Order must be executed before Order Received
* Order Received must be executed before choosing whether to execute Payment Processing or skip it
* If Payment Processing is chosen, then the loop between Payment Approved and Payment Rejected will start; if not, then Invoice Sent will be executed
* The loop between Payment Approved and Payment Rejected must be completed before executing Invoice Sent

Please note that this is a simple example and real-world POWL models may be more complex and include additional nodes, operators, and partial orders.
