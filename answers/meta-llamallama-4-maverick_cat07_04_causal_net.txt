The image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of handling a request, accompanied by a key explaining the symbols used in the chart.

*   The flowchart is divided into two main sections: the top-left section and the bottom-right section.
    *   The top-left section features a complex flowchart with various nodes labeled with letters and descriptive text.
        *   The flowchart begins with a node labeled "a" and "register request," which branches out to multiple nodes representing different stages in the process.
        *   The nodes are connected by arrows indicating the direction of the process flow.
        *   Some nodes have multiple inputs or outputs, while others have only one.
        *   The flowchart includes decision points, such as "examine thoroughly" and "check ticket," which determine the next step in the process based on certain conditions.
        *   The flowchart also includes action nodes, such as "pay compensation" and "reject request," which represent specific tasks or outcomes.
    *   The bottom-right section contains a key that explains the symbols used in the flowchart.
        *   The key is presented in a gray box with a black border.
        *   It includes six symbols, each representing a different type of node or connection in the flowchart.
        *   The symbols are labeled as follows:
            *   XOR-split
            *   AND-split
            *   OR-split
            *   XOR-join
            *   AND-join
            *   OR-join
        *   Each symbol is accompanied by a brief description of its meaning in the context of the flowchart.

In summary, the image provides a detailed flowchart illustrating the process of handling a request, along with a key that explains the symbols used in the chart. The flowchart is complex and includes various decision points and action nodes, while the key helps to clarify the meaning of the symbols used.
