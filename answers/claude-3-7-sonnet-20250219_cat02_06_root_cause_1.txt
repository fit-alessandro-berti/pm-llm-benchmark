# Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

## 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

I've calculated the total resolution time for each ticket (from receipt to closure):

| Case ID | Total Resolution Time | Required Escalation? |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 101     | 2 hours 15 minutes    | No                   |
| 102     | 25 hours 10 minutes   | Yes                  |
| 103     | 1 hour 20 minutes     | No                   |
| 104     | 24 hours 10 minutes   | No                   |
| 105     | 49 hours 5 minutes    | Yes                  |

Cases with significantly longer resolution times are:
- **Case 105**: Nearly 50 hours (2+ days)
- **Case 102**: About 25 hours (1+ day)
- **Case 104**: About 24 hours (1 day)

## 2. Root Causes of Performance Issues

### Escalation Factor
- Cases requiring escalation to Level-2 Agents (102 and 105) have substantially longer resolution times
- Case 105 had the longest overall time, with a 28-hour gap between escalation and when the Level-2 Agent began investigation

### Wait Times Between Activities
| Case ID | Critical Delays Identified |
|---------|----------------------------|
| 102     | • 2.5 hours between assignment and escalation<br>• 2.5 hours between escalation and investigation<br>• 19 hours between investigation and resolution |
| 104     | • 3.5 hours between assignment and investigation<br>• 19 hours between investigation and resolution |
| 105     | • 28 hours between escalation and Level-2 investigation<br>• 19 hours between Level-2 investigation and resolution |

### Overnight/Weekend Transitions
- Cases spanning multiple calendar days (102, 104, 105) experience "dead time" overnight
- Weekend effect amplifies delays (Case 105 spans into a third day)

### Resource Allocation Issues
- Level-1 Agent investigation initiation varies significantly (10 minutes to 3.5 hours after assignment)
- Level-2 resource availability appears inconsistent (particularly evident in Case 105)

## 3. Impact Analysis and Recommendations

### Key Insights
1. **Escalation process is a major bottleneck** - adds at least 24 hours to resolution time
2. **Overnight transitions create artificial delays** - work stops and resumes the next day
3. **Resource availability varies throughout the day** - particularly for Level-2 agents

### Recommendations

1. **Optimize the Escalation Process**:
   - Implement direct handoffs between Level-1 and Level-2 agents
   - Create a fast-track protocol for complex cases identified during triage

2. **Address Resource Allocation**:
   - Schedule overlapping shifts to ensure continuous coverage
   - Implement a workload balancing system to ensure cases are picked up promptly after assignment

3. **Improve Procedural Efficiency**:
   - Establish SLAs for time between activities (especially investigation initiation)
   - Consider a follow-the-sun support model for critical tickets

4. **Enhance Ticket Tracking**:
   - Implement automated alerts for tickets idle for more than a predetermined time
   - Create dashboards to highlight cases approaching SLA thresholds

By addressing these issues, the organization could potentially reduce resolution times for complex cases by 50% or more, significantly improving customer satisfaction and support team efficiency.
