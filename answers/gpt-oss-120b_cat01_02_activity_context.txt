We need to produce answer: identify recurring activities: Verify Documents appears multiple times in same case, with different context (initial verification vs re-check after additional docs). Call Customer appears multiple times with different purposes (request missing docs, clarify discrepancy, follow-up, return request). Adjust Account appears multiple times across cases but maybe only once per case? In C002 and C003 each have Adjust Account once. So only Verify Documents and Call Customer need renaming. Also maybe Initiate Request appears once per case, no need. Approve Request once.

We need rename: For Verify Documents: first occurrence could be "Initial Document Verification", second "Re-Verification after Additional Docs". For C003 second verification after adjustment: "Post-Adjustment Document Re-Verification". Could be generic: "Document Verification (Initial)" and "Document Verification (Recheck)". Provide per case.

Call Customer: contexts: C001: request missing docs => "Call Customer (Missing Docs Request)". C002 first call: clarify account discrepancy => "Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy)". Second call: confirm adjustments => "Call Customer (Confirm Adjustments)". C003: call to have them return => "Call Customer (Recall Walk-in)". Provide rename.

We need revised log with new activity names. Provide justification.

Make sure formatting with markdown table. Use LaTeX for any math? Not needed.

Will produce answer.

### 1.  Activities that repeat inside a single case  

| Activity (original) | Cases where it repeats | How the meaning changes (contextual clues) |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Verify Documents** | C001, C003 | *First occurrence* – a **pre‑screening** of the documents that were supplied with the request. <br>*Second occurrence* – a **re‑check** after the customer has supplied additional material or after an internal account adjustment. |
| **Call Customer** | C001, C002, C003 | *C001* – the call is made **to request missing documentation**. <br>*C002‑first* – the call is made **to clarify an account discrepancy** discovered during verification. <br>*C002‑second* – the call is a **follow‑up to confirm that the adjustments have been applied**. <br>*C003* – the call is made **to ask a walk‑in customer to return to the branch**. |

These two activities are the only ones that appear more than once in the same case, and each occurrence carries a distinct business meaning that is not captured by the generic label.

### 2.  Renaming strategy  

| Original activity | New activity (example) | Rationale |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Verify Documents (first) | **Document Verification – Initial** | Indicates the first, “baseline” check of the documents supplied with the request. |
| Verify Documents (second) | **Document Verification – Re‑check** (or **Post‑Adjustment Re‑verification** for C003) | Shows that the activity is a **second pass** after new information or an internal correction. |
| Call Customer (C001) | **Call Customer – Request Missing Docs** | The call’s purpose is to obtain documents that were not provided initially. |
| Call Customer (C002‑first) | **Call Customer – Clarify Discrepancy** | The call is used to resolve a mismatch discovered during verification. |
| Call Customer (C002‑second) | **Call Customer – Confirm Adjustments** | The call follows the internal adjustment and confirms the outcome with the customer. |
| Call Customer (C003) | **Call Customer – Recall Walk‑in** | The call asks a walk‑in to return to the branch after stepping out. |

The new names keep the original activity verb (“Verify”, “Call”) but add a **qualifier** that makes the role explicit.

### 4.  Justification of the new names  

| New activity name | Contextual clue(s) used for renaming |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Document Verification – Initial** | The *Additional Context* column mentions “checks identity documents” or “physical verification of ID” **before** any follow‑up actions. |
| **Document Verification – Re‑check** / **Post‑Adjustment Re‑verification** | The second occurrence follows a *Submit Additional* event (C001) or an *Adjust Account* event (C003), indicating a **re‑examination** of the documents. |
| **Call Customer – Request Missing Docs** | The log notes “Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs.” |
| **Call Customer – Clarify Discrepancy** | The context says “Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.” |
| **Call Customer – Confirm Adjustments** | The second call in C002 is described as “Follow‑up call to confirm adjustments made.” |
| **Call Customer – Recall Walk‑in** | In C003 the officer “calls to have them return” after the customer stepped out of the branch. |

By appending a concise qualifier that directly mirrors the textual cue in the *Additional Context* column, each renamed activity becomes self‑explanatory. This eliminates ambiguity for downstream process‑mining, conformance checking, or stakeholder communication, while preserving the original process semantics.
