### Process Mining Event Log

Below is the transformed event log based on the provided system log. Each row corresponds to a meaningful activity in a process instance (case). The log includes the required attributes: **Case ID**, **Activity Name**, and **Timestamp**.

| Case ID               | Activity Name                          | Timestamp                  |

### Explanation of Transformation Logic

#### 1. **Case Identification**
   - Cases were identified based on the **Window Title** attribute, as it represents the specific document, email, or file being worked on. For example:
     - Events related to `Document1.docx` were grouped into one case.
     - Events related to `Email - Inbox` were grouped into another case.
     - Similarly, `Report_Draft.pdf` and `Budget_2024.xlsx` formed separate cases.
   - This grouping reflects logical units of work, such as editing a document, handling an email, reviewing a PDF, or updating a spreadsheet.

#### 2. **Activity Naming**
   - Raw actions like "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH," etc., were translated into higher-level, meaningful activities:
     - **Start Editing Document**: Triggered by the first "FOCUS" action on a document.
     - **Typing Content**: Corresponds to "TYPING" actions within a document.
     - **Save Document**: Represents "SAVE" actions.
     - **Close Document**: Represents "CLOSE" actions.
     - **Open Email**: Triggered by "CLICK" actions that open an email.
     - **Reply to Email**: Triggered by "CLICK" actions with the description "Reply to Email."
     - **Send Email**: Triggered by "CLICK" actions with the description "Send Email."
     - **Review PDF**: Triggered by "SCROLL" or "HIGHLIGHT" actions within a PDF.
     - **Update Spreadsheet**: Triggered by "TYPING" actions within a spreadsheet.
   - These standardized activity names provide a clear narrative of user work sessions.

#### 3. **Event Attributes**
   - **Case ID**: Derived from the **Window Title** attribute to group related events.
   - **Activity Name**: Translated from raw actions using the logic described above.
   - **Timestamp**: Preserved from the original log to maintain temporal context.

#### 4. **Coherent Narrative**
   - The final event log tells a story of user work sessions across multiple applications and documents:
     - The user starts editing `Document1.docx`, types content, saves it, and later resumes editing after switching contexts.
     - The user handles an email, replies to it, and sends it.
     - The user reviews a PDF document (`Report_Draft.pdf`) and highlights key findings.
     - The user updates a spreadsheet (`Budget_2024.xlsx`) and saves the changes.
     - Finally, the user edits and saves another document (`Quarterly_Report.docx`) before closing it.

This transformation ensures the event log is suitable for analysis with standard process mining tools, providing insights into user workflows and task sequences.
