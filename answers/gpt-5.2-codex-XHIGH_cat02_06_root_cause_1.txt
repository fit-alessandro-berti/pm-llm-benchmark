Below is a concise analysis of the log, focusing on total cycle time per ticket and the likely causes of delay.

## 1. **Cases with Long Resolution Times**

**Cycle time = Receive Ticket  Close Ticket**

| Case | Start  End | Total Duration | Comment |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **101** | 08:00  10:15 (same day) | **2h 15m** | Fast |
| **103** | 08:10  09:30 (same day) | **1h 20m** | Fast |
| **102** | 08:05  next day 09:15 | **~25h 10m** | **Long** |
| **104** | 08:20  next day 08:30 | **~24h 10m** | **Long** |
| **105** | 08:25  2 days later 09:30 | **~49h 5m** | **Very long** |

**Significant outliers:** **Cases 102, 104, 105**  
Case 105 is the longest by far.

## 2. **Likely Root Causes of Delay**

###  **Escalation to Level2**
- **Cases 102 and 105** include escalation.
- After escalation, there are **large idle gaps**:
  - **Case 102:** ~19 hours between investigation and resolution.
  - **Case 105:** ~28 hours between escalation and next investigation.

**Interpretation:** Level2 resources appear to be a bottleneck or are not available quickly.

---

###  **Long Waiting Times Between Steps (Even Without Escalation)**
- **Case 104** has **no escalation**, yet still takes ~24 hours.
- Large delays:
  - **Assign  Investigate:** ~3.5 hours  
  - **Investigate  Resolve:** ~19 hours (overnight)

**Interpretation:** Delays likely due to agent workload, shift boundaries, or cases waiting in queue.

---

###  **Overnight / Offhours Gaps**
Long idle periods across evening/overnight are visible in 102, 104, and 105.  
This suggests resolution is constrained to business hours, causing nextday continuation.

## 3. **How These Factors Increase Cycle Time & Recommendations**

###  **How delays occur**
- **Escalation adds handoffs and queues** (Level2 backlog).
- **Idle gaps dominate total duration**, not the actual work time.
- **Overnight gaps add a full day**, even if the work is short.

###  **Recommendations**
1. **Improve Level2 capacity / availability**
   - Add Level2 staffing or create oncall rotation.
   - Set SLA for escalated ticket response.

2. **Speed up escalations**
   - Escalate earlier when needed (avoid “delay then escalate”).
   - Automate routing based on ticket type.

3. **Reduce idle time between activities**
   - Monitor queue times between stages.
   - Assign tickets automatically when triaged.
   - Introduce queue alerts when tickets sit too long.

4. **Extend coverage / shift handoffs**
   - Coverage across evening shifts can prevent overnight idle gaps.

##  Summary

- **Long cases (102, 104, 105)** are dominated by *waiting* rather than *work*.
- **Escalation to Level2** is the biggest structural delay.
- **Idle gaps and overnight pauses** drive cycle time more than the actual investigation.

Reducing handoff queues and increasing Level2 availability will have the largest impact on overall resolution speed.
