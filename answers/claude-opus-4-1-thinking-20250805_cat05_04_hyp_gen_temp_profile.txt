## Temporal Profile Analysis

### Identified Anomalies

1. **Receive to Approve (RP)**: Average time of ~25 hours with an unusually tight standard deviation of 1 hour suggests an artificial or automated approval process that bypasses normal evaluation procedures.

2. **Approve to Notify (PN)**: The 7-day average delay between approval and customer notification is excessive, indicating severe bottlenecks or systematic delays in the communication process.

3. **Assign to Close (AC)**: A 2-hour average suggests claims are being closed directly after assignment without proper evaluation or approval steps.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (EN)**: The 5-minute transition time is unrealistically short for a manual process, suggesting either automation or data quality issues.

### Potential Root Causes

**Process Bypassing**: The direct transitions (AC, EN) suggest certain claims may be fast-tracked or automatically processed based on specific criteria, potentially compromising thoroughness.

**Resource Constraints**: The extended PN delay could indicate insufficient staffing in customer communication departments or batch processing of notifications at weekly intervals.

**Data Entry Issues**: The rigid RP timing might reflect bulk data imports or scheduled batch processing rather than real-time claim handling.

**Segmented Workflows**: Different claim types or amounts may follow abbreviated workflows, explaining the inconsistent activity sequences.

### SQL Verification Queries

**1. Identify claims with anomalous RP timing:**
```sql
WITH claim_transitions AS (
  SELECT 
    r.claim_id,
    r.timestamp as receive_time,
    p.timestamp as approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) as seconds_to_approve
  FROM claim_events r
  JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
  WHERE r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
  ct.claim_id,
  c.claim_type,
  c.claim_amount,
  ct.seconds_to_approve/3600.0 as hours_to_approve
FROM claim_transitions ct
JOIN claims c ON ct.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ABS(ct.seconds_to_approve - 90000) > 3600
ORDER BY ct.seconds_to_approve;
```

**2. Analyze the extended PN delays by resource and region:**
```sql
WITH approval_notification AS (
  SELECT 
    p.claim_id,
    p.timestamp as approve_time,
    n.timestamp as notify_time,
    p.resource as approver,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))/86400.0 as days_to_notify
  FROM claim_events p
  JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
  WHERE p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
  a.approver,
  adj.region,
  COUNT(*) as claim_count,
  AVG(an.days_to_notify) as avg_days_to_notify,
  MAX(an.days_to_notify) as max_days_to_notify
FROM approval_notification an
JOIN claims c ON an.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters adj ON an.approver = adj.name
GROUP BY a.approver, adj.region
HAVING AVG(an.days_to_notify) > 5
ORDER BY avg_days_to_notify DESC;
```

**3. Detect claims closed immediately after assignment:**
```sql
WITH direct_closures AS (
  SELECT 
    a.claim_id,
    a.timestamp as assign_time,
    c.timestamp as close_time,
    a.resource as adjuster
  FROM claim_events a
  JOIN claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
  WHERE a.activity = 'A' AND c.activity = 'C'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e 
      WHERE e.claim_id = a.claim_id 
        AND e.activity IN ('E', 'P')
        AND e.timestamp BETWEEN a.timestamp AND c.timestamp
    )
)
SELECT 
  dc.claim_id,
  cl.claim_type,
  cl.claim_amount,
  dc.adjuster,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (dc.close_time - dc.assign_time))/3600.0 as hours_to_close
FROM direct_closures dc
JOIN claims cl ON dc.claim_id = cl.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (dc.close_time - dc.assign_time)) < 10800
ORDER BY hours_to_close;
```

**4. Investigate rapid EN transitions:**
```sql
SELECT 
  e.claim_id,
  c.claim_amount,
  c.claim_type,
  e.resource as evaluator,
  n.resource as notifier,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))/60.0 as minutes_to_notify
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
  AND n.timestamp > e.timestamp
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 600
ORDER BY minutes_to_notify;
```

**5. Profile overall process compliance:**
```sql
WITH claim_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    claim_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '' ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
  activity_sequence,
  COUNT(*) as frequency,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM claim_sequences
GROUP BY activity_sequence
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

These queries will help identify specific instances of timing anomalies, correlate them with business attributes, and reveal systematic patterns that may explain the unusual temporal profile characteristics.
