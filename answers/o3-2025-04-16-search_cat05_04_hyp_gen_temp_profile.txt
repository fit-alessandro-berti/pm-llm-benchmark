Anomalies detected in the temporal profile model  

1. Receive  Approve (RP)  
   • Avg  25 h (90 000 s) but STDEV = 1 h (3 600 s)  unusually tight spread for a full-day interval, suggesting an artificial or scripted cadence rather than natural variation.  

2. Approve  Notify (PN)  
   • Avg = 7 days (604 800 s) with STDEV = 2 days (172 800 s)  very long delay and large spread, indicating either a backlog that periodically clears or ad-hoc fast-track notifications for some claims.  

3. Assign  Close (AC)  
   • Avg = 2 h (7 200 s). In the intended flow, Evaluate (E) and Approve (P) should occur before Close (C). A rapid AC implies some claims bypass intermediate steps or are withdrawn/denied without evaluation.  

4. Evaluate  Notify (EN)  
   • Avg = 5 min (300 s) with low STDEV = 1 min (60 s). This is suspiciously quick for any manual follow-up and may mean that an automatic message is fired before approval, or that Evaluate and Approve are sometimes collapsed into a single action mislabeled as E.  

5. Receive  Approve (RP) vs. Receive  Evaluate (RE)  
   • RE mean is 24 h, yet RP mean is only 1 h longer (25 h). Given that Approve must follow Evaluate, one would expect a wider gap. The narrow difference hints that Evaluate timestamps could be entered retroactively or batched.  

Hypotheses explaining the anomalies  

H1. Scripted nightly batch approvals  
    Claims sit in “Evaluate” all day; at a fixed time a batch job marks them approved, producing a tight RP distribution.  

H2. Notification queue congestion  
    Customer notifications are processed by a separate system every few days, causing wide PN variance. Urgent claims may be pushed through manually, explaining occasional short delays.  

H3. Fast-track or auto-close rules  
    Low-value or duplicate claims may be auto-closed right after assignment (AC) without evaluation.  

H4. Mis-tagged activities  
    Some tools might record an “Evaluate” event automatically when an adjuster opens a claim, inflating RE counts while true evaluation happens later, or not at all.  

H5. Resource bottlenecks  
    Particular adjusters or regions could accumulate claims, lengthening PN, while others handle them quickly, producing the high variance.  

Verification approaches (SQL)  

Note: PostgreSQL syntax; adjust for your dialect if needed.

-- 1. Claims whose ReceiveApprove time falls outside  ± 3 (i.e., < 19 h or > 31 h)
WITH pairs AS (
  SELECT
    ce1.claim_id,
    MIN(ce1.timestamp)  AS receive_ts,
    MIN(ce2.timestamp)  AS approve_ts,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp)) AS sec_diff
  FROM claim_events ce1
  JOIN claim_events ce2 USING (claim_id)
  WHERE ce1.activity = 'R'
    AND ce2.activity = 'P'
  GROUP BY ce1.claim_id
)
SELECT *
FROM pairs
WHERE sec_diff < 19*3600
   OR sec_diff > 31*3600;

-- 2. Long PN lags (> 9 days) and very short ones (< 3 days)
WITH pn AS (
  SELECT
    ce1.claim_id,
    MIN(ce1.timestamp) AS approve_ts,
    MIN(ce2.timestamp) AS notify_ts,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp)-MIN(ce1.timestamp))/86400 AS days_diff

  JOIN claim_events ce2 USING (claim_id)
  WHERE ce1.activity = 'P'
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  GROUP BY ce1.claim_id
)
SELECT c.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       a.adjuster_id,
       pn.days_diff
FROM pn
JOIN claims c   USING (claim_id)
LEFT JOIN claim_events cea
       ON cea.claim_id = pn.claim_id AND cea.activity='A'
LEFT JOIN adjusters a
       ON a.adjuster_id = cea.resource::INTEGER  -- assuming resource stores adjuster_id
WHERE pn.days_diff > 9
   OR pn.days_diff < 3
ORDER BY pn.days_diff DESC;

-- 3. Claims closed within 2 h of assignment (possible auto-close)
WITH ac AS (
  SELECT
    ce1.claim_id,
    MIN(ce1.timestamp) AS assign_ts,
    MIN(ce2.timestamp) AS close_ts,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp)-MIN(ce1.timestamp)) AS sec_diff

    AND ce2.activity='C'
  GROUP BY ce1.claim_id

SELECT ac.*, c.claim_type
FROM ac
JOIN claims c USING (claim_id)
WHERE sec_diff <= 7200;

-- 4. Evaluate immediately followed by Notify (< 2 min)
WITH en AS (
  SELECT
    ce1.claim_id,
    MIN(ce1.timestamp) AS eval_ts,
    MIN(ce2.timestamp) AS notify_ts,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp)-MIN(ce1.timestamp)) AS sec_diff
  FROM claim_events ce1
  JOIN claim_events ce2 USING (claim_id)

       c.claim_amount,
       c.claim_type

-- 5. Correlate PN delay with adjuster and region
WITH pn_delay AS (
  SELECT
    ce1.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp)-MIN(ce1.timestamp))/86400 AS days_diff
  FROM claim_events ce1
  JOIN claim_events ce2 USING (claim_id)
  WHERE ce1.activity='P'
    AND ce2.activity='N'
  GROUP BY ce1.claim_id
),
assigner AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         ce.resource::INTEGER AS adjuster_id
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity='A'
)
SELECT a.region,
       a.name,
       ROUND(AVG(p.days_diff),2) AS avg_days,
       COUNT(*) AS num_claims
FROM pn_delay p
JOIN assigner s USING (claim_id)
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = s.adjuster_id
GROUP BY a.region, a.name
ORDER BY avg_days DESC;

Running these queries will reveal which claims and which actors (adjusters, regions, claim types) are associated with each timing anomaly, helping confirm or refute the hypotheses above.
