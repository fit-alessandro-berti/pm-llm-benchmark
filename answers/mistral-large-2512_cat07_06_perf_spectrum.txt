The provided visualization is a event flow diagram, specifically a Sankey Diagram, which illustrates the progression and transitions of processes over time related to fines. The diagram is segmented into three key stages: "Send Fine," 'Insert Fine Notification,' and 'Send for Credit Collection.' The vertical bars at each stage represent the volume of cases at that point in time, while the streams or flows between these bars depict the transitions of these cases from one stage to another. The x-axis represents the timeline, spanning from January 25, 2000, to April 24, 2013. The diagram shows how cases move through these stages, with some cases transitioning directly and others possibly getting delayed or rerouted. The red-colored flows indicate specific transitions or subsets of the data, likely highlighting key pathways or anomalies in the process. Overall, the diagram conveys the flow efficiency and bottlenecks in the fine processing system over the given period.
