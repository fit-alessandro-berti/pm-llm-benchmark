Here is an updated declare_model with bias-mitigating constraints added. New activities introduced for fairness control:
- CheckApplicantRace (detects sensitive attribute disclosure)
- BiasMitigationCheck (ensures fairness step is performed)
- ManualReview (additional review step)
- Approve_Minority / Reject_Minority (decision outcomes tied to minority applicants)

The added constraints enforce that any minority-related decision is accompanied by a manual review, that a bias-mitigation check occurs after any race-check, and that a bias-mitigation check must occur before minority-related decisions. They also prevent direct succession from a race-check to a minority decision without the mitigation step.

Python code for the updated model:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {
            "Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

Rationale for each added constraint:

- Coexistence: Approve_Minority and Reject_Minority must co-occur with ManualReview.
  - Why: If a decision is made for applicants from sensitive demographics, a ManualReview should be part of the same trace to ensure fairness and an explicit human check. This prevents biasful automated decisions from bypassing a thorough review.

- Response: CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck.
  - Why: After an event disclosing sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender, age), a BiasMitigationCheck should occur to assess potential bias in subsequent decisions, reducing biased auto-decisions.

- Precedence: BiasMitigationCheck must precede Approve_Minority and Reject_Minority.
  - Why: Ensures that no minority-related decision occurs before a BiasMitigationCheck has been performed, preventing immediate biased outcomes.

- Non-succession: CheckApplicantRace cannot be immediately followed by Approve_Minority or Reject_Minority.
  - Why: Directly connecting a sensitive attribute disclosure to a minority decision without an intervening mitigation step increases the risk of biased outcomes; this constraint enforces a requisite intermediate step (BiasMitigationCheck) before the decision.

Overall impact: The added constraints introduce a bias-aware control layer in the DECLARE model, requiring explicit verification and review when sensitive attributes are involved in the loan application process. This helps ensure fairness, reduces the risk of discrimination, and promotes consistent handling of minority applicants.
