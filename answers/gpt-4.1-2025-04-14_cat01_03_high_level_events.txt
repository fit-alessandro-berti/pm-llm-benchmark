Certainly! Here’s a structured approach to mapping the provided low-level event log into high-level, meaningful process steps. I’ll show both the grouping, the rationale, and provide domain-appropriate names for each.

## 1. **High-Level Step Identification and Mapping**

### Step 1: **Material Preparation**
**Grouped Low-Level Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
All these activities involve the initial handling, identification, positioning, and conditioning of the raw material (metal sheet) before actual manufacturing work begins. They are performed sequentially, primarily by Operator A and Robot Arm #2, and Heating Unit #1, and all occur close in time and before tool usage or transformation steps.

---

### Step 2: **Welding / Assembly**
**Grouped Low-Level Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
These events are all centered on the key transformation—joining parts (welding). "Pick up welding tool" signals the start of assembly, while the actual welds (by Operator B) are the main assembly actions. These logically belong together as they are all focused on the mechanical assembly of the item.

### Step 3: **Weld Quality Verification**
**Grouped Low-Level Events:**
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale:**
This step involves using a Quality Sensor to objectively assess the correctness or strength of the welds. It is a control point between physical assembly and post-process finishing, and is a distinct verification phase in manufacturing.

---

### Step 4: **Surface Finishing**
**Grouped Low-Level Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
Both these actions are about applying and curing a protective finish to the item. They are always performed in sequence, and both relate to achieving the final surface properties required for product durability.

---

### Step 5: **Final Inspection**
**Grouped Low-Level Event:**
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
This is performed at the end by another operator, and is distinct from earlier automated quality checks. It serves as the final assurance step before the item exits the process.

## 2. **Aggregated High-Level Activities Table**

| High-Level Step Name      | Included Low-Level Activities                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Material Preparation  | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet |
| 2. Welding / Assembly    | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                       |
| 3. Weld Quality Verification | Measure weld integrity                                               |
| 4. Surface Finishing     | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                    |
| 5. Final Inspection      | Visual check                                                            |

## 3. **Summary of Groupings and Reasoning**

### **Material Preparation**
- **Events grouped** because they are all components of readiness and setup.
- **Temporal Proximity:** All happen before tool usage or assembly.
- **Resource Alignment:** Consistent involvement of operator and handling machines.
- **Domain Logic:** Corresponds to preparing the raw material for manufacturing.

### **Welding / Assembly**
- **Events grouped** as they constitute the core joining/transformation work.
- **Sequence:** Follows material handling and precedes any finishing or checking.
- **Resource Logic:** Assembled by the same operator(s) and using the specific tool.

### **Weld Quality Verification**
- **Single event block**—weld checking, always follows welding.
- **Quality Control:** Distinct measuring/checking action performed by sensor.

### **Surface Finishing**
- **Events grouped** as all relate to surface treatment (and happen after quality check).
- **Process Phase:** Both coating and drying are the steps needed for surface adhesion and protection.

### **Final Inspection**
- **Single, final action** that provides the last human inspection/approval before completion.

## **Conclusion**

This structure makes the workflow more interpretable for process mining, analytics, and operations review by aggregating granular events into logical, high-impact process phases. The grouping is based on workflow logic, order of execution, resource type, and manufacturing domain knowledge.
