Based on my understanding of healthcare and medical processes, I can identify some potential differences in treatment between the "protected" group and the unprotected group:

1. **Access to Expert Examination**: The unprotected group has more variants that involve expert examination (e.g., Register at ER -> Expert Examination), which may indicate a higher level of scrutiny or specialized care. In contrast, the protected group seems to have fewer opportunities for expert examination.
2. **Frequency and Performance of Treatment Successful Outcomes**: The unprotected group shows a higher frequency (1466-1418) and better performance (320004.432-319999.055) in treatment successful outcomes compared to the protected group (19).
3. **Variants with Thorough Examination**: The unprotected group has more variants that involve thorough examination, which may indicate a greater emphasis on detailed evaluation or investigation.
4. **Treatment Unsuccessful Outcomes and Re-Diagnosis**: The unprotected group has more variants that involve treatment unsuccessful outcomes followed by re-diagnosis and re-treatment, which may suggest a more flexible approach to diagnosis and treatment.
5. **Registration at Different Facilities**: The unprotected group seems to have a broader range of registration options (FD, ER), whereas the protected group only appears to register at FD.

These differences could be indicative of unfair disparities in treatment between the protected and unprotected groups, potentially driven by factors such as access to specialized care, financial resources, or social determinants.
