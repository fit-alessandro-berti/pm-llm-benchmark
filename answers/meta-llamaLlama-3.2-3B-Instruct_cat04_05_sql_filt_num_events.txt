**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
```
**Explanation:**

This query uses a subquery to identify the `case_id`s that have six or fewer events. The subquery groups the `event_log` table by `case_id` and uses the `HAVING` clause to filter the results to only include `case_id`s with a count of six or fewer.

The outer query then selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` is present in the subquery's result set.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose the `event_log` table contains the following data:
```markdown
+---------+-----------+------------+
| case_id | activity  | timestamp  |
+---------+-----------+------------+
| 1       | login     | 2022-01-01 |
| 1       | login     | 2022-01-02 |
| 1       | login     | 2022-01-03 |
| 1       | logout    | 2022-01-04 |
| 1       | logout    | 2022-01-05 |
| 1       | logout    | 2022-01-06 |
| 2       | start     | 2022-01-07 |
| 3       | start     | 2022-01-08 |
| 3       | start     | 2022-01-09 |
| 3       | start     | 2022-01-10 |
+---------+-----------+------------+
```
Running the above query would return:
```markdown
+---------+-----------+------------+
| case_id | activity  | timestamp  |
+---------+-----------+------------+
| 1       | login     | 2022-01-01 |
| 1       | login     | 2022-01-02 |
| 1       | login     | 2022-01-03 |
| 1       | logout    | 2022-01-04 |
| 1       | logout    | 2022-01-05 |
| 1       | logout    | 2022-01-06 |
+---------+-----------+------------+
```
Only the events from case 1 are returned, as it has six or fewer events.
