### Violations Identified:

#### Case 2:
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-06 09:00 - Receive order
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-06 09:30 - Check inventory
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-06 10:00 - Package items
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-06 10:30 - Authorize payment
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-06 11:00 - Ship order
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-06 11:30 - Close order

**Violation:**
- **Issue:** The order was checked for inventory at 09:30 but the package items were done at 10:00 without authorization payment first. According to the normative process, "Package items" should only occur after "Authorization payment."

**Explanation:**
- The normative process states that "Package items" should happen after "Authorization payment," which means that the order should be authorized for payment before the items are packaged. In Case 2, the order was packaged before the payment was authorized, violating this rule.

#### Case 3:
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-07 09:00 - Receive order
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-07 09:20 - Check inventory
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-07 09:40 - Authorize payment
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-07 10:00 - Cancel order
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-07 10:30 - Ship order
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-07 11:00 - Close order

**Violation:**
- **Issue:** The order was canceled at 10:00, but the ship order was done at 10:30. According to the normative process, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items," and "Package items" should only occur after "Authorization payment." Since the order was canceled, it should not have proceeded to "Ship order."

**Explanation:**
- The normative process specifies that "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items," which in turn should happen after "Authorization payment." However, in Case 3, the order was canceled at 10:00, and the ship order was done at 10:30, which violates the rule that "Ship order" should not occur after a cancellation.

#### Case 4:
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-08 09:00 - Receive order
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-08 09:10 - Check inventory
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-08 09:20 - Cancel order
- **Timestamp:** 2023-10-08 09:50 - Close order

**Violation:**
- **Issue:** The order was canceled at 09:20, but no further actions were taken beyond closing the order. According to the normative process, after canceling an order, the next logical step should be to close the order, which is already done in this case. However, the issue lies in the fact that the order was canceled without any preceding steps that would justify the closure.

**Explanation:**
- The normative process suggests that after a cancellation, the order should be closed. However, in Case 4, the order was canceled at 09:20, and the closure occurred at 09:50. There seems to be no intermediate action between the cancellation and the closure, which could imply that the order was closed prematurely without any preceding steps justifying it.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2:** Packaging items before authorization payment.
2. **Case 3:** Shipping after a cancellation.
3. **Case 4:** Closing an order without any preceding steps justifying it.
