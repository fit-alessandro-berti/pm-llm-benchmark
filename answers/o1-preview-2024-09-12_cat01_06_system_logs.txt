**Explanation:**

In transforming the raw system log into an event log suitable for process mining, I followed these steps:

1. **Case Identification:**
   - **Grouping by Document or Email Subject:** Each case represents a logical unit of work centered around a specific document or email thread. For example:
     - All interactions with **"Document1.docx"** are grouped into one case.
     - Activities involving the email titled **"Annual Meeting"** form another case.
     - Interactions with **"Report_Draft.pdf"**, **"Budget_2024.xlsx"**, and **"Quarterly_Report.docx"** are each grouped into separate cases.
   
2. **Activity Naming:**
   - **Standardizing Actions:** I translated low-level system actions into higher-level, standardized activity names to reflect meaningful process steps.
     - **"FOCUS"** and **"SWITCH"** actions when starting work on a file are translated to **"Open Document"** or **"Open Spreadsheet"**.
     - **"TYPING"** actions are mapped to **"Edit Document"** or **"Update Spreadsheet"**, depending on the application.
     - **"SAVE"** actions become **"Save Document"** or **"Save Spreadsheet"**.
     - **"CLICK"** actions in the email context are interpreted as **"Open Email"**, **"Compose Reply"**, or **"Send Email"** based on the action description.
     - **"SCROLL"** and **"HIGHLIGHT"** in PDFs are translated to **"Review Document"** and **"Annotate Document"** respectively.

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - **Case ID:** Assigned based on the document or email subject to group related events.
   - **Activity Name:** Standardized to reflect the user's process-oriented actions.
   - **Timestamp:** Directly taken from the original system log for temporal accuracy.
   - **Application:** Included as an additional attribute to provide context about which application was used for each activity.

4. **Coherent Narrative:**
   - The final event log tells a comprehensive story of the user's work sessions throughout the morning. By grouping events into cases based on the documents and emails, we can see how the user:
     - Began working on **"Document1.docx"**, drafting and adding details.
     - Took a break to handle an important email about the **Annual Meeting**, composing and sending a reply.
     - Reviewed and annotated key findings in **"Report_Draft.pdf"**.
     - Updated the financial data in **"Budget_2024.xlsx"**.
     - Returned to **"Document1.docx"** to insert a reference to the updated budget.
     - Finally, worked on the **"Quarterly_Report.docx"**, drafting the executive summary.

By following this approach, the event log aligns with process mining standards and provides meaningful insights for analysis. The standardized activity names and clear case identification make it suitable for use in process mining tools, facilitating the discovery of process models and identification of performance metrics.
