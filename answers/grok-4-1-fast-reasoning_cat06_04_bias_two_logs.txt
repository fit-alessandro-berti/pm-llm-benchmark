**Group B (Unprotected Group) log exhibits bias.**

### How Bias Manifests
- **ScoreAdjustment Column**: Exclusive to Group B, where applicants with `CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"` receive a consistent **+10 "Community Boost"** across PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, and FinalDecision stages (e.g., U001: 720  730; U003: 695  705). Group A has no adjustments (all 0 or N/A). This artificially inflates scores for select Group B applicants.
- **LocalResident Attribute**: All Group B entries have `LocalResident = TRUE` (vs. `FALSE` in Group A), enabling or correlating with the boost. No Group A applicants qualify, suggesting the boost is conditional on local residency.
- **CommunityGroup Attribute**: Acts as a trigger—only Group B applicants with "Highland Civic Darts Club" get the boost (U001, U003). U002 (None) receives no boost, mirroring Group A's neutral treatment.

### Systematic Differences in Final Decisions
- **Approval Threshold Inconsistency**: Group A decisions align strictly with PreliminaryScore (720 approved; <720 rejected; e.g., P001/P003 approved at 720/740; P002 rejected at 710). Group B deviates:
  | Case | Group | Initial Score | Final Score | Decision | Notes |
  |------|-------|---------------|-------------|----------|-------|
  | P002 | A     | 710           | 710         | Rejected | Standard. |
  | U002 | B     | 710           | 710         | Rejected | Matches A (no boost). |
  | U003 | B     | 695           | 705         | **Approved** | Lower than P002/U002 but approved due to boost. |
- **Approval Rates**: Both groups have 2/3 approvals, but Group B's include a sub-710 initial score (U003), enabled by the boost. Without boosts, U003 (695) would likely reject like equivalents in Group A.
- **Impact**: Favors Group B locals in community groups, creating unequal outcomes. E.g., U001 (720  730 approved) parallels P001 but gets unnecessary uplift; U003 crosses the ~710-720 threshold artificially. This disadvantages Group A (non-locals, no community ties), leading to disparate impact based on residency and affiliations—classic algorithmic bias via proxy variables (LocalResident/CommunityGroup). Group A shows neutral, score-based processing.
