 Sensitive attributes for fairness are those attributes that can potentially lead to discrimination or bias in the process. From the attributes you provided, the following ones could be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. case:citizen: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen or not. Discrimination based on citizenship status is illegal in many jurisdictions, and it could lead to unfair treatment in the hiring process.
2. case:gender: Gender discrimination is also illegal in many places. Ensuring equal opportunities for all genders is crucial for fairness.
3. case:german speaking: This attribute could potentially lead to language bias, which may affect the hiring process, especially for jobs that do not require German language skills.
4. case:religious: Religious discrimination is another form of unfair treatment. Ensuring that religious beliefs do not impact the hiring process is essential for fairness.

It's important to note that these attributes should not be used to make decisions directly related to the hiring process. Instead, focusing on skill and qualifications ensures a fair and equitable evaluation of all applicants. Additionally, removing these attributes from the event log (anonymization) could help to avoid potential biases for analysis and process improvement purposes.
