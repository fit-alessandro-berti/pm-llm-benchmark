Below is a proposed aggregation of the sample log into five high-level process steps. For each step you’ll find (a) the list of low-level events it contains, (b) a concise name, and (c) the rationale for the grouping. At the end you’ll see how these mappings apply to both Case A1 and Case B2.

**1. Material Preparation**  
- Name: Material Preparation  
- Constituent Low-Level Events:  
  1. Retrieve raw metal sheet  
  2. Scan barcode  
  3. Place metal sheet on table  
  4. Align metal sheet  
  5. Preheat metal sheet  

- Rationale:  
All five events occur at the very start of the process, are temporally contiguous (08:00:05–08:00:25), and collectively ready the blank for fabrication. “Retrieve,” “scan,” and “place” establish traceability and positioning; “align” and “preheat” ensure the part is physically and thermally ready for the next (welding) phase.

**2. Welding Assembly**  
- Name: Welding Assembly  
- Constituent Low-Level Events:  
  6. Pick up welding tool  
  7. Weld corner A  
  8. Weld corner B  

- Rationale:  
These three events form a tight sub-sequence (08:01:00–08:01:10) driven by the same resource (Operator B) and share the common goal of joining the part. Picking up the tool initiates the assembly action; the two spot-welds complete the structural join.

**3. In-Process Quality Check**  
- Name: In-Process Quality Inspection  
- Constituent Low-Level Events:  
  9. Measure weld integrity  

- Rationale:  
Immediately after welding, a sensor-based check verifies weld quality before proceeding. Isolating this as its own step highlights the built-in quality gate between assembly and finishing.

**4. Coating Process**  
- Name: Protective Coating Application  
- Constituent Low-Level Events:  
  10. Apply protective coating  
  11. Dry coating  

- Rationale:  
These two events (08:01:30–08:01:45), although using different machines (Coating Unit #3  Heating Unit #2), share the same functional purpose: to deposit and cure the corrosion-resistant layer. Grouping them under “Coating” distinguishes finishing from both assembly and inspection.

---

**5. Final Quality Inspection**  
- Name: Final Visual Inspection  
- Constituent Low-Level Events:  
  12. Visual check  

- Rationale:  
This last event (08:02:00) is a human-performed, holistic pass/fail check of the fully assembled and coated part. By keeping it separate, we preserve the clear end-of-line quality gate.

## Mapping Back to Each Case

| Case | Material Prep | Welding Assembly | In-Process QA | Coating Process | Final QA         |
|------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| A1   | Events 1–5    | Events 6–8       | Event 9       | Events 10–11    | Event 12         |
| B2   | Events 1–5    | Events 6–8       | Event 9       | Events 10–11    | Event 12         |

*(“Events 1–5” refers to the first five rows for that case, etc.)*

## Grouping Rules Inferred

1. **Temporal Contiguity**: Events that occur back-to-back within a short window are candidates for the same high-level step.  
2. **Common Goal/Function**: Actions that collectively achieve a single objective (e.g. join, coat, inspect) are grouped.  
3. **Resource & Tool Consistency**: Sequences driven by the same operator or machine tend to form one logical stage.  
4. **Checkpoints as Separate Steps**: Quality checks (sensor-based or visual) are isolated as distinct stages to highlight inspection gates.  

By applying these rules across the full log, you can turn thousands of granular events into a concise, five-step process model that’s far easier to read, analyze, and optimize.
