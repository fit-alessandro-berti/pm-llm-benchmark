What you are looking at is a time-line (x-axis) of individual cases moving through three successive activities of a fines-management process, drawn in a “thread-trace” style that is common in process-mining dashboards.

1. Axes and labels  
   • The horizontal (x) axis is absolute calendar time, running from 25 Jan 2000 (left) to 24 Apr 2013 (right).  
   • The vertical (y) axis is not a numeric scale but three discrete activity lanes:  
     – “Send Fine” (top lane)  
     – “Insert Fine Notification” (middle lane)  
     – “Send for Credit Collection” (bottom lane)

2. What each line means  
   • Each thin line represents one case (one fine) and links the timestamps at which that case visited the three activities.  
   • Because “Send Fine” and “Insert Fine Notification” usually happen within minutes of each other, their two nodes are drawn almost on top of one another, giving the dense vertical stack of grey strokes in the upper box.  
   • After notification, the case remains idle for some time (days, weeks, or months) before it is finally “Sent for Credit Collection”. That waiting time is the slanted segment that drops from the middle lane down to the bottom lane.

3. Density and colour  
   • Grey strokes in the upper two lanes: huge volume, very fast succession. The compactness tells you that thousands of fines are created and notified continuously over the 13-year period.  
   • Pink/red diagonal strokes in the lower half: far fewer cases reach credit-collection compared with the number that were issued.  
   • Opacity/shade appears to encode the duration or some risk flag: pale pink for ordinary delays, deeper red for unusually long or otherwise notable delays.

4. Overall pattern  
   • The figure is almost a “comet”: a thick grey “body” (high-frequency early steps) followed by a long, sparse, red-tinted “tail” (a subset of cases that survive long enough to be escalated).  
   • The downward-and-to-the-right slope of each tail line visualises the waiting time; the steeper the slope, the longer the gap between being notified and being handed over to collections.  
   • Large blank wedges between groups of tails reveal periods in which very few or no cases were escalated.

5. What you can learn at a glance  
   • The notification step is almost immediate after a fine is created.  
   • Only a small proportion of fines end up in credit collection.  
   • The delay before credit collection varies widely—some cases are escalated quickly (steep light-pink lines), others languish for years (flat, dark-red lines).  
   • Activity volume is fairly steady over the entire 13-year window (no obvious seasonality or gaps in the grey region), but escalation behaviour changes: clusters of red tails appear and disappear over time, possibly reflecting policy changes or backlog clearing campaigns.

In short, the graphic is a process-timeline view that contrasts a very high-volume, near-instant first phase (“Send Fine”  “Insert Fine Notification”) with a low-volume, highly variable second phase (“Insert Fine Notification”  “Send for Credit Collection”), using vertical stacking to show frequency and diagonal linkage to convey waiting time.
