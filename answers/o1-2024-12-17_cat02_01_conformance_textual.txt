**Identifying Violations:**

We begin by comparing each case in the event log against the normative sequences defined in the provided textual description.

**Normative Sequences:**

1. **If inventory is sufficient** (the "fulfillment" scenario):  
   The required order of activities should be:  
   *Receive order* → *Check inventory* → *Authorize payment* → *Package items* → *Ship order* → *Close order*.

2. **If inventory is insufficient** (the "cancellation" scenario):  
   The required order of activities should be:  
   *Receive order* → *Check inventory* → *Cancel order* → *Close order*.

**Key Constraints from the Description:**

- **"Authorize payment"** must occur **after "Check inventory"** but **before "Package items"**.
- **"Package items"** must occur **after "Authorize payment"** but **before "Ship order"**.
- **"Ship order"** must occur **after "Package items"** in the fulfillment scenario and must never occur after a cancellation.
- In the cancellation scenario, once "Cancel order" has occurred, the process should proceed directly to "Close order" without any of the fulfillment-related steps (no packaging or shipping).

**Case-by-Case Analysis:**

### Case 1  
**Recorded activities:**  
1. Receive order (09:00)  
2. Check inventory (10:00)  
3. Authorize payment (11:00)  
4. Package items (12:00)  
5. Ship order (13:00)  
6. Close order (14:00)

**Assessment:** This perfectly aligns with the inventory-sufficient scenario. The order is correct: after inventory check, payment was authorized, then items were packaged, then shipped, and finally the order was closed.  
**Conclusion:** **No violation**.

### Case 2  
**Recorded activities:**  
1. Receive order (09:00)  
2. Check inventory (09:30)  
3. Package items (10:00)  
4. Authorize payment (10:30)  
5. Ship order (11:00)  
6. Close order (11:30)

**Assessment:**
- According to the rules, "Package items" must only occur after "Authorize payment." Here, packaging happened before payment authorization.
- The correct sequence for a sufficient inventory scenario should have been: Check → Authorize Payment → Package Items → Ship → Close.  
By packaging items before authorizing payment, the case violates the normative flow.

**Conclusion:** **Violation** due to "Package items" occurring before "Authorize payment."

### Case 3  
**Recorded activities:**  
1. Receive order (09:00)  
2. Check inventory (09:20)  
3. Authorize payment (09:40)  
4. Cancel order (10:00)  
5. Ship order (10:30)  
6. Close order (11:00)

**Assessment:**
- If the order is going to be canceled (insufficient inventory scenario), the sequence should be: Receive → Check → Cancel → Close, with no payment authorization or shipping.
- Here, the process authorized payment, which suggests inventory sufficiency, but then canceled the order. This contradicts the intended logic: cancellation should occur directly after checking inventory if there's insufficient stock, without going through payment authorization.
- After cancellation, the process should not continue with fulfillment activities like "Ship order." Yet, this case attempts to ship after cancellation, which is explicitly disallowed.

**Conclusion:** **Multiple violations**:  
- Authorizing payment followed by cancellation contradicts the expected branch logic.  
- Shipping after cancellation is not allowed.

### Case 4  
**Recorded activities:**  
1. Receive order (09:00)  
2. Check inventory (09:10)  
3. Cancel order (09:20)  
4. Close order (09:50)

**Assessment:**
- This follows the exact pattern for insufficient inventory: Receive → Check → Cancel → Close.  
**Conclusion:** **No violation**.

### Case 5  
**Recorded activities:**  
1. Receive order (09:00)  
2. Check inventory (10:00)  
3. Authorize payment (10:30)  
4. Ship order (11:00)  
5. Close order (11:30)

**Assessment:**
- In a sufficient inventory scenario, "Ship order" must be preceded by "Package items." Here, they skipped "Package items" entirely.
- The expected sequence should have included "Package items" before "Ship order."

**Conclusion:** **Violation** due to missing "Package items" before "Ship order."

---

**Summary of Violations:**

- **Case 1:** No violation (compliant sequence).
- **Case 2:** Violated the order by packaging items before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3:** Violated the logic by authorizing payment and then canceling, and also by shipping after cancellation.
- **Case 4:** No violation (correct cancellation sequence).
- **Case 5:** Violated the sequence by shipping without first packaging items.

These deviations reflect failures to adhere to the prescribed sequence of activities and conditions as outlined in the normative process description.
