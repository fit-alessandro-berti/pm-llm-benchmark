PROCESS-MINING PLAYBOOK FOR SPEEDY PARCELS
====================================================

1. PROCESS DISCOVERY & CONFORMANCE CHECKING
------------------------------------------------
1.1 Data Preparation & Integration  
• Canonical event schema  {case_id, activity, start_ts, end_ts (opt), resource, location, attributes}.  
• Case definition  
  - Vehicle-Day (e.g., “V12-20241205”) for end-to-end route analysis.  
  - Package ID for parcel-level punctuality / failure analysis.  
   Use object-centric logs so one extraction feeds both views.  
• Linking logic  
  - Join GPS & scanner records on nearest-in-time match (30 s) and same vehicle.  
  - Merge dispatch plan as “Planned Route” events with ordering index (Stop 1 … Stop n).  
  - Add maintenance events with separate activity labels (“Scheduled Maintenance”, “Breakdown Repair”).  
• Cleansing challenges  
  - Different clocks / timezones  NTP correction.  
  - High-frequency GPS (every 5 s)  filter by status change (ignition, arrival, departure) to avoid “spaghetti” models.  
  - Missing or duplicated scanner scans (driver forgets to press)  infer using GPS dwell 2 min at customer geofence.  
  - Multi-granularity (vehicle vs package)  store object type column and use OC-PM tools (Celonis OCPM, PM4Py-OCPM).  

1.2 Process Discovery  
• For Vehicle-Day view: Inductive Miner or Split Miner with noise threshold 10 %  produces sound, comprehensible model showing:  
  Start Shift  [Travel  Service]*  Return Depot  End Shift, with side branches “Breakdown”, “Refuel”, “Traffic Idle”.  
• Overlay duration / frequency to highlight loops or rare behaviours (e.g., repeat visit after failed delivery).  

1.3 Conformance with Dispatch Plan  
• Convert dispatch plan into reference Petri Net / BPMN with ordered delivery activities and expected time KPIs (from planning software).  
• Align each operational trace with reference using token-based replay:  
  Metrics to extract:  
  - Fitness: % of moves on model vs log.  
  - Timing deviation: planned-actual per activity & overall route.  
  - Illegal moves: “Unplanned Stop”, “Out-of-sequence Delivery”, “Skipped Stop”.  
• Produce deviation heat-map per driver, vehicle, route and per time window (rush hour vs off-peak).

2. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS & BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------
2.1 Core KPIs (calculable from enriched log)  
1. On-Time Delivery Rate = #deliveries within customer window ÷ total deliveries.  
2. Average Service Time/Stop = mean(Depart Customer – Arrive Customer).  
3. Travel:Service Ratio = travel duration ÷ service duration (per route).  
4. Fuel /km = fuel drawn ÷ distance (requires OBD or pump receipts joined by time).  
5. Vehicle Utilisation = route duration ÷ driver paid hours.  
6. Traffic Delay Frequency = #GPS “Low Speed < 5 km/h > 3 min” events.  
7. Failed Delivery Rate = (#Delivery Failed + #Return-to-Depot parcels) ÷ total.  
8. Unscheduled Maintenance Downtime = duration breakdown events during shift.  

2.2 Bottleneck Detection Techniques  
• Performance overlay on model  red arcs where mean /95-percentile duration high.  
• Trace-variant frequency vs performance scatter  rare variants often slower.  
• Activity association rules (e.g., Breakdown  40 min extra).  
• Geospatial process mining: cluster GPS points; heat-map idle hotspots.  
• Temporal clustering: compare morning vs afternoon shift durations.  
• Driver/Vehicle dashboards: control-chart service times; flag outliers.  
• Quantification: compute delta KPI if specific feature present (e.g., “Traffic Idle” adds average +26 min).

3. ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS
----------------------
Potential causes & validating analyses:

a) Sub-optimal static routing  
   • Compare planned vs mined path distance/time; systematic +10-15 % indicates planning bias.  
   • Decision-point mining: drivers frequently reorder stops despite plan  route sequencing flaw.

b) Inaccurate travel-time estimates  
   • Histogram of (actual – planned) per road segment & TOD (time-of-day). Persistent positive skew  outdated speed profiles.

c) Traffic congestion patterns  
   • Overlay Low-Speed events on city map + time heat-map; Monday 07:30-09:00 corridor X stands out.

d) High service-time variability  
   • Boxplot service time by customer type; apartments with no concierge median = 7 min vs houses = 3 min.

e) Vehicle breakdowns  
   • Pivot unscheduled maintenance events vs mileage since last service; Weibull regression predicts probability; certain van model crosses 20 000 km threshold  3× failure risk.

f) Driver behaviour  
   • Compare fuel/km & idle time per driver; top-quartile idling >20 % time correlates with +8 % fuel.

g) Failed deliveries  
   • Trace cluster where “Delivery Failed” followed by “Reattempt Next Day”; root cause often “Customer Not Home” outside window; frequency 12 %.

4. DATA-DRIVEN OPTIMISATION STRATEGIES
--------------------------------------
STRATEGY 1 – Dynamic Traffic-Aware Re-Routing  
• Target: Travel delays, low on-time rate, excess fuel.  
• Root cause: Static plan ignores real-time congestion.  
• Data support: Log shows average +18 min when Low-Speed events on highway A41.  
• Implementation: Integrate live traffic API; re-optimise remaining stops every 15 min, constrained by vehicle capacity, time windows, driver hours.  
• Expected impact:  
  - On-Time Delivery 5-8 pp.  
  - Travel:Service ratio 10 %.  
  - Fuel/km 4 %.

STRATEGY 2 – Territory & Stop-Sequence Optimisation via Historical Mining  
• Target: Excess km, high travel-time share.  
• Root cause: Mis-aligned depot loading zones & stop order.  
• Approach: Use k-means clustering on geo-coordinates weighted by historical service times; build new compact territories; sequence stops with savings algorithm using mined average travel times, not Euclidean distance.  
• Process-mining evidence: Cases where driver self-reordered stops show 7 % shorter distance.  
• Expected impact:  
  - Distance travelled per parcel 12 %.  
  - Vehicle utilisation .  
  - Maintenance & fuel costs  proportionally.

STRATEGY 3 – Predictive Maintenance Scheduling  
• Target: Unscheduled breakdowns causing delays & overtime.  
• Root cause: Mileage-based maintenance intervals too coarse.  
• Data support: Survival analysis of event log  failure probability spikes after 550 engine-hours or 80 % brake-pad wear.  
• Implementation: Schedule maintenance just before predicted failure window; push low-risk vehicles to later slots to keep capacity.  
• Expected impact:  
  - Unscheduled downtime 60 %.  
  - On-time rate 2-3 pp (fewer mid-route breakdowns).  
  - Maintenance cost neutral/slightly  (replace “emergency repairs” with planned service).

STRATEGY 4 – Proactive Customer ETA & Re-booking  
• Target: Failed delivery / re-delivery cost.  
• Root cause: Customer absence.  
• Data support: 72 % of failures occur when arrival time drifts >30 min beyond promised window.  
• Action: Send live ETA SMS + allow customer to select “leave with neighbour” or reschedule before driver arrives.  
• KPI gain: Failed Delivery Rate 40 %, extra km for re-delivery 6 %.

STRATEGY 5 – Targeted Eco-Driving & Idling Reduction Training  
• Target: High fuel per km & overtime.  
• Root cause: 20 % drivers idle >25 % shift.  
• Data insights: Fuel/km correlates 0.73 with idle-time%.  
• Intervention: Coaching + cab alert for >3 min idle.  
• Impact: Fuel/km 5-7 %, CO , overtime 1-2 %.

5. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS & CONTINUOUS MONITORING
---------------------------------------------------
5.1 Respecting Constraints  
• Optimisation algorithms include:  
  - Driver hours-of-service (max 9 h driving, breaks 45 min/4.5 h).  
  - Vehicle capacity & volume.  
  - Customer promised windows and priority parcels.  
  - Maintenance booking calendar.  
  - Labour agreements (shift start/end at depot).  

5.2 Monitoring & Governance  
• Build Celonis / PowerBI dashboards fed nightly from event streams. Key widgets:  
  1. Real-time Conformance Gauge – % routes on plan (fitness).  
  2. On-Time Delivery trend (daily, per region).  
  3. Bottleneck Map – top 10 traffic idle hotspots last 7 days.  
  4. Maintenance Risk heat-map – probability of failure by vehicle.  
  5. Fuel & Idle Leaderboard per driver.  
• Drill-down views: variant explorer, case Animation replay.  
• Alerting rules:  
  - If ETA drift >20 min for high-priority parcel  push customer SMS.  
  - If driver exceeds legal driving time  dispatch reallocates stops.  
• Quarterly review: compare KPIs to baseline; re-run discovery to ensure model stability; update prediction models with new data.

By combining rigorous process-mining analytics with targeted optimisation initiatives, Speedy Parcels can systematically raise punctuality, cut fuel and maintenance costs, and embed a culture of continuous, data-driven improvement in its last-mile operations.
