<answer>To solve this problem, we need to filter out cases with more than six events and return only the events from cases with six or fewer events. We achieve this by first calculating the number of events per `case_id`, then filtering those cases, and finally retrieving the events from the remaining cases.  


### Step-by-Step Explanation  
1. **Group by `case_id` and count events**: Use a subquery (or CTE) to group the `event_log` by `case_id` and count the number of events for each case.  
2. **Filter cases with  6 events**: From the grouped results, filter out `case_id` values where the event count exceeds six.  
3. **Join back to the original log**: Use the filtered `case_id` values to retrieve all events from the original `event_log` table for those cases.  


### DuckDB SQL Query  
```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        `case_id`, 
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        `event_log`
    GROUP BY 
        `case_id`
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    `event_log` el
JOIN 
    (
        SELECT 
            `case_id` 
        FROM 
            case_counts
        WHERE 
            event_count <= 6
    ) filtered_cases ON el.`case_id` = filtered_cases.`case_id`
```

### Explanation of the Query  
- **`case_counts` CTE**: Groups the `event_log` table by `case_id` and counts the number of events for each case.  
- **Subquery in the JOIN condition**: Filters the `case_id` values to include only those with 6 or fewer events.  
- **Final SELECT statement**: Joins the original `event_log` with the filtered `case_id` values, returning all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) for cases meeting the criteria.  


This approach ensures that only events from cases with six or fewer total events are returned, effectively filtering out the unwanted cases.
