### Overall Description
This visualization is a multi-panel diagram (labeled as parts **a**, **b**, and **c**) illustrating a workflow in a laboratory information system, likely within a healthcare context. It depicts the interaction between an **order system**, **Hospital Information System (HIS)**, and **lab testing processes** (e.g., chemical tests). The core concept is **two protocol classes** (representing structured communication protocols) connected through **two channels** (e.g., "Order" and another implied channel like "Lab" or "HIS"). Arrows show data flow, decisions, and loops for retries or reports. The diagram combines a flowchart, a class diagram snippet, and a communication log table to explain "performatives" (speech-act-like messages in agent-based or distributed systems).

### Part (a): Main Flowchart – Lab Test Workflow
This is the central flowchart showing the end-to-end process for ordering, performing, and reporting lab tests:

- **Key Nodes (from left to right/top to bottom)**:
  - **Lab visit** / **Sample input** (entry point, e.g., patient blood sample collection).
  - **Order system** (top center): Initiates orders.
  - **HIS** (central hub): Processes orders, results, and reports.
  - **Lab test** (right side): Includes sub-processes like **chemical test**.
  - **Lab assistant** (bottom left): Handles retries ("Do test again").
  - **Send report** (output).

- **Arrows and Flows** (direction indicated by arrows, some bidirectional or labeled 1–3?):
  - **Order system  HIS** (order placement).
  - **HIS  Lab test** (sends test requests, e.g., "Chemical test perform").
  - **Lab test  HIS** (returns results, e.g., "Test result", "Chemical report").
  - Loops:
    - **HIS  Lab test** (result feedback, e.g., "Receive result").
    - **Lab assistant  HIS** ("Do test again" if judgment fails, e.g., "Lab judgment").
  - Decision points: "Gevery" (possibly "Every" or "Green light"?), "Judge result".
  - Outputs: **Send report** from HIS.

The flowchart emphasizes iterative testing (e.g., retests via lab assistant) and integration between ordering, execution, and reporting systems.

**Caption/Title under (a)**: "Two protocol classes connected through two channels".

### Part (b): Class Test Structure
A small boxed diagram showing:
- **Class test** as a container.
- Inside: **Two protocol classes** – **Chemical test** (with "Finish test", "Chemical result") and another (possibly "Lab test" or similar, with "Protocol").
- Labeled: "(b) Class test containing the two protocol classes".

This illustrates how lab tests are modularized into protocol classes for chemical analysis and related processes.

### Part (c): Example of a Performative (Communication Table)
A table logging a specific message exchange (performatives are structured, actionable messages like in multi-agent systems):

| Time  | Channel | Sender  | Receiver | Action             | Content       | Scope  | Direction |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|--------------------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| 11:30 | Order  | Lab    | Lab test | Create test for John? | (implied) | Private | OUT      |

- **Notes**:
  - "HIS" appears at the end, possibly indicating scope or final destination.
  - This row exemplifies a performative: A lab sender initiates a test creation action via the "Order" channel, directed outward (OUT) to the lab test receiver, privately scoped.
- **Caption**: "(c) Example of a performative".

### Summary Interpretation
The diagram models a **distributed lab system** where protocol classes (e.g., for chemical testing) communicate via channels (e.g., Order, Lab/HIS). It highlights workflow loops, result validation, and performative messaging for actions like test creation. This is likely from a technical paper on healthcare informatics, agent protocols, or e-health systems.
