Why the XOR branch is problematic  
• Only one of the two paths after preliminary scoring can be taken:  
  – Path 1   D  (CheckLocalAffiliation)  
  – Path 2   skip (nothing happens)

• If an application is routed through D the applicant may receive a “small score uplift” or other favourable signal before the ManualReview (E).  
• If the branch is taken to skip, the applicant receives no such uplift.

What determines which branch is chosen?  
In the model it is not an explicit legal-risk feature such as race or gender, but “local affiliation”:  
• “Local resident” or “member of a known community group” typically correlates with social network, geography, language, or cultural ties.  
• These attributes are not legally protected in most jurisdictions, so the system designer may regard them as innocuous.  
• Nevertheless they are often highly correlated with protected traits (e.g., ethnicity, national origin) and with socioeconomic privilege (e.g., neighbourhood wealth, access to community resources).

Subtle bias introduced by the XOR operator  
1. Unequal opportunity to obtain the uplift  
   – Applicants embedded in majority or better-served neighbourhoods are more likely to be flagged as “local affiliation = yes”.  
   – Others—including migrants, first-generation residents, or people from historically marginalised communities—rarely trigger D and thus cannot get the uplift.  
   – The XOR structure freezes this discrepancy: there is no compensating branch that could advantage the “non-affiliated” applicants.

2. Amplification at the decision boundary  
   – A “small uplift” is often decisive for borderline cases.  
   – Suppose a score of 650 is an automatic accept. A borrower coming out of C with 640 who obtains +15 for local affiliation crosses the threshold, whereas an equally risky borrower without the affiliation stays below it.  
   – This produces systematic disparate impact that may be hard to detect because the delta is small and hidden inside the process tree.

3. Masking from manual oversight  
   – By the time an application reaches ManualReview (E), the numerical score already contains the uplift. The underwriter may not even see that it originated from local affiliation, so human review does not necessarily correct the bias.

Fairness and legal implications  
• Disparate impact: Even if the rule is facially neutral, statistical analysis may show that protected classes are disproportionately routed through skip. Under U.S. fair-lending law (ECOA/Reg-B) or similar EU directives, that is sufficient to trigger scrutiny.  
• Proxy discrimination: Geography, club membership, and community ties are classic proxy variables for race, ethnicity, or religion. Regulators increasingly treat them as high-risk features.  
• Lack of explainability: If the model must provide the “key factors” that influenced a credit decision, local affiliation may appear as an explanation—opening the institution to reputational and legal risk.

Practical consequences  
1. Borderline approvals tilt toward the majority group, compounding existing wealth gaps.  
2. Over time the portfolio skews toward areas where the lender already has a strong presence, reinforcing red-lining patterns.  
3. Applicants who are denied receive “insufficient credit score” as the reason, never learning that an unobservable local-affiliation flag was decisive.

How to mitigate  
• Remove the XOR branch or make D a separate, transparently documented rule whose effect is audit-able.  
• If local knowledge is genuinely related to risk (e.g., fraud reduction), quantify it and apply the benefit to all applicants via observable, consistent criteria—e.g., “verified residence  18 months” instead of “member of X club”.  
• Run disparate-impact tests: compare acceptance rates with and without D across protected classes; simulate counterfactuals where the same applicant toggles the affiliation flag.  
• Provide clear disclosures in adverse-action notices so that hidden criteria can be challenged.  
• Consider including a compensating pathway or uplift for applicants lacking local ties (e.g., verified employment history) to equalise opportunity.

Summary  
The XOR split that selectively invokes CheckLocalAffiliation (D) embeds a seemingly minor preference that in practice advantages applicants who resemble the lender’s existing customer base. Because the advantage is additive and applied early, it can sway final outcomes for borderline cases and create disparate impact against protected or disadvantaged groups. Careful auditing, transparent criteria, and re-design of the process tree are needed to align the model with fairness and equity objectives.
