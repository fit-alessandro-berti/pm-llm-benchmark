 In the given event log, the attributes that are sensitive for fairness are: "case:citizen", "case:gender", and "case:german speaking". These attributes are often considered sensitive or protected attributes for fairness analysis, as they refer to personal characteristics of an individual (e.g., race, gender, nationality) that are often legally protected and should not influence the outcome of a process.

The "case:married" attribute could also be considered sensitive for fairness, depending on the context and specific regulations. However, it might be less commonly considered a protected attribute compared to the others.

These attributes could influence the process outcomes, potentially leading to unfair or biased results. It is crucial to consider these attributes in fairness analysis to ensure equal treatment and outcomes for all individuals, regardless of their personal characteristics.
