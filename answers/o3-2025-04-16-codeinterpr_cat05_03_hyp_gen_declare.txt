ANOMALIES IN THE DECLARE MODEL  

1. Mandatory closing but forbidden evaluation  
   • “C” (Close) is required in every case (existence).  
   • “E” (Evaluate) is prohibited from co-occurring with “C” (noncoexistence).  
   • Result: the process can never contain an evaluation, although evaluation is part of the intended flow.

2. Evaluation may precede assignment  
   • responded_existence(E , A) only says “if E happens, A must also happen sometime”.  
   • No precedence(A , E) is stated, so “A” could occur after “E”, contradicting the idea that an adjuster is assigned first.

3. Essential steps can be skipped  
   • No constraints mention “P” (Approve) or “N” (Notify).  
   • Apart from “R” and “C”, every other activity is optional, allowing paths such as R  C.

4. Partial specification of start / end  
   • init(R) forces “R” to be the first activity, but nothing forbids additional “R” events later in the trace.  
   • Only one closing activity is required, but multiplicity is not restricted; “C” could appear several times.

5. Redundant / self-defeating constraints  
   • responded_existence(E , A) becomes irrelevant because anomaly 1 already makes “E” impossible.  
   • precedence(C , R) is redundant with init(R) because “R” is necessarily the first event anyway.

HYPOTHESES FOR WHY THE ANOMALIES APPEAR  

A. Requirement drift  
   – Business analysts added the “always close” rule later but forgot to relax the older “no evaluation with close” rule.

B. Misinterpretation of DECLARE templates  
   – The modeler wanted “evaluation must happen before closing” and inadvertently wrote a non-coexistence constraint instead of a precedence constraint.

C. Data-driven mining noise  
   – The model was mined from an event log where evaluation happened in a parallel IT system and was therefore invisible; the algorithm concluded “E” never appears together with “C”.

D. Performance pressure shortcuts  
   – Operations wanted the option to pay small claims immediately, so they added a path R  C, but the removal of the “no evaluation” ban was overlooked.

E. Incremental policy updates  
   – New compliance rules made closing mandatory, but legacy rules still block evaluation when closing, causing the contradiction.

SQL-BASED VERIFICATION STRATEGIES  

/* 1. Claims that were closed without ever being evaluated */  
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce2
      WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id
        AND ce2.activity = 'E'
);

---------------------------------------------------------------  
/* 2. Traces where evaluation and closing BOTH occur  
      – would violate the noncoexistence rule               */  
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E', 'C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2;

---------------------------------------------------------------  
/* 3. Evaluations that have no preceding assignment  
      (timestamp-based order check)                          */  
WITH e AS (
    SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS e_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'E'
    GROUP BY claim_id
),
a AS (
    SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS a_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'A'
    GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT e.claim_id, e.e_time, a.a_time
FROM e
LEFT JOIN a USING (claim_id)
WHERE a.claim_id IS NULL          -- no assignment at all
   OR a.a_time > e.e_time;        -- assignment after evaluation

---------------------------------------------------------------  
/* 4. Claims that skipped approval or notification  
      yet still contain a close                              */  
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
    OR SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;

---------------------------------------------------------------  
/* 5. Multiple close events in the same claim */  
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS close_count
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'C'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

---------------------------------------------------------------  
/* 6. Claims evaluated by unassigned resources  
      – cross-checking adjuster information                  */  
SELECT e.claim_id, e.resource AS evaluator
FROM claim_events e
LEFT JOIN (
      SELECT claim_id, resource
      FROM claim_events
      WHERE activity = 'A'
) a ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
  AND (a.resource IS NULL OR a.resource <> e.resource);

These queries reveal whether the contradictory or underspecified paths actually occur, providing evidence to refine the DECLARE model or to correct the underlying process.
