To model the complex manufacturing and distribution process of high-end appliances using POWL, we'll first identify the activities and their dependencies based on the provided event log. From the event log, we can observe the following relationships:

1. **Order Received (OR)**: Starts the process.
2. **Material Sourcing (MS)**: Follows OR.
3. **Quality Screening (QS)**: Follows MS.
4. **Assembly (AS)**: Follows QS, and might repeat if IQC fails.
5. **In-line Quality Check (IQC)**: Follows AS. If fails, loops back to AS.
6. **Testing (TST)**: Follows successful completion of AS after IQC.
7. **Re-Testing (RT)**: If TST fails, loops back to TST.
8. **Packaging (PK)**: Follows successful TST (or RT).
9. **Labeling (LB)**: Optional, follows PK.
10. **Distribution Planning (DP)**: Follows PK or LB if LB is performed.
11. **Dispatch (D)**: Follows DP.

Based on these observations, the POWL model can be structured as follows:

- **Main Sequence**: OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> IQC
- **Loop for AS and IQC**: While IQC fails, loop back to AS.
- **Test Sequence**: After successful AS (post-IQC), proceed to TST.
- **Loop for Retesting**: If TST fails, loop back to TST.
- **Post-Testing**: Proceed to PK.
- **Optional Labeling**: LB can be performed after PK.
- **Distribution Planning and Dispatch**: DP follows PK or LB, and D follows DP.

### POWL Model Construction:

1. **Define Transitions (Activities)**:
```python
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
```

2. **Define Loops and Choices**:
- **Loop for AS and IQC**:
```python
as_iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])
```

- **Loop for Retesting**:
```python
tst_rt_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])
```

3. **Define Optional Labeling**:
```python
labeling_option = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[PK, LB])
```

4. **Main Workflow**:
- The main workflow includes all sequential steps and loops defined above.
```python
main_workflow = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[OR, MS, QS, as_iqc_loop, tst_rt_loop, PK, labeling_option, DP, D]
)

# Define the order between the nodes
main_workflow.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(QS, as_iqc_loop)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(as_iqc_loop, tst_rt_loop)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(tst_rt_loop, PK)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(PK, labeling_option)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(labeling_option, DP)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

This structure captures the complex dependencies and loops within the manufacturing and distribution process as observed in the event log. It represents the main workflow path, the looping back for quality checks and retesting, and the optional step of labeling before proceeding to distribution planning and dispatch.
