<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to create two POWL models for the hiring process described, one with potential unfairness and another without. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the process steps. From the description, the main steps are: Receive Application, Data Completeness Check (with a loop if info is missing), Skill Assessment, Cultural Fit Check (with the XOR branch in the unfair model), Managerial Review, and Final Decision.

For the first model (with unfairness), the key point is the XOR branch after Skill Assessment. One branch is the standard Cultural Fit Check, the other is CommunityAffiliationCheck which gives an advantage. Then, after that, Managerial Review and Final Decision.

In the second model (without unfairness), there's no XOR branch. All applicants go through the same Cultural Fit Check, so that step is a single activity without any branching.

Now, how to model this in POWL. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with the loop for data completeness. The initial steps are: ReceiveApplication, then a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. The loop would mean that DataCompletenessCheck is executed first. If data is incomplete, RequestMoreInfo is done, then loop back to DataCompletenessCheck. Once data is complete, proceed to SkillAssessment.

Then, in the unfair model, after SkillAssessment, there's an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Both branches would lead to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision. But since XOR is exclusive, the process would choose one path. The CommunityAffiliationCheck here introduces bias.

In the fair model, after SkillAssessment, there's just a single CulturalFitCheck activity (no XOR), then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Now, structuring the POWL models. Let's outline each model's components.

For both models:

- The loop structure is the same: DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo in a loop. So a loop operator with A being DataCompletenessCheck and B being RequestMoreInfo.

Then, the steps after loop:

ReceiveApplication -> loop -> SkillAssessment. Then branching for the cultural fit.

In the unfair model, after SkillAssessment, there's an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then both branches lead to ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

In the fair model, after SkillAssessment, only CulturalFitCheck (so no XOR), then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But how to model the sequence after XOR? Because after the XOR branch, both branches must converge to the next steps (ManagerialReview and FinalDecision). However, in POWL, XOR is a choice between sub-models. So perhaps after the XOR, we have the common steps.

Wait, the XOR would be between the two cultural check activities. Then after whichever is chosen, the process proceeds to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision.

So in the unfair model:

SkillAssessment -> XOR (CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

But how to represent that in POWL's structure, which uses partial order and operators.

POWL uses StrictPartialOrder nodes and operators. The structure would have a partial order where nodes are ordered in sequence.

So for the first model:

The loop is a loop operator between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Then, after the loop, comes SkillAssessment. Then, an XOR between the two cultural check options, then ManagerialReview followed by FinalDecision.

Wait, but in the example code provided, the loop and XOR are part of a StrictPartialOrder with edges indicating order. So each main step is in a partial order with edges indicating sequence.

Let me think of the first model step by step.

Root is a StrictPartialOrder containing nodes:

- ReceiveApplication

- loop node (which contains DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo in a loop)

- SkillAssessment

- XOR node (with CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck)

- ManagerialReview

- FinalDecision

But how to order these nodes. The order should be:

ReceiveApplication -> loop -> SkillAssessment -> XOR -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

But in POWL, each of these steps must be ordered. The loop node is a single node in the StrictPartialOrder, as is the XOR node.

Wait, no. The loop is an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP and children A and B (the two parts of the loop). Similarly, the XOR is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR and two children.

Then, the overall structure would be a StrictPartialOrder that sequences these elements in order.

So for the unfair model:

The nodes in the root StrictPartialOrder are:

1. ReceiveApplication (Transition)

2. Loop OperatorPOWL (DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo)

3. SkillAssessment (Transition)

4. XOR OperatorPOWL (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck)

5. ManagerialReview (Transition)

6. FinalDecision (Transition)

The order edges would be:

ReceiveApplication -> Loop

Loop -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> XOR

XOR -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

But wait, the order in the StrictPartialOrder must have all nodes connected in the sequence. So each node is followed by the next.

Similarly, in the fair model, the XOR is replaced by a single CulturalFitCheck activity.

Now, let's outline each model's components.

First, the unfair model:

- ReceiveApplication (Transition)
- Loop Operator (LOOP between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo)
- SkillAssessment (Transition)
- XOR Operator (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck)
- ManagerialReview (Transition)
- FinalDecision (Transition)

Ordered as per the process flow.

In code terms:

A = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
loop_part = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [Transition("DataCompletenessCheck"), Transition("RequestMoreInfo")])
skill = Transition("SkillAssessment")
xor = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [Transition("CulturalFitCheck"), Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")])
manager = Transition("ManagerialReview")
final = Transition("FinalDecision")

root = StrictPartialOrder([A, loop_part, skill, xor, manager, final])
root.order.add_edge(A, loop_part)
root.order.add_edge(loop_part, skill)
root.order.add_edge(skill, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, manager)
root.order.add_edge(manager, final)

Wait, but in the example given in the code, the root is a StrictPartialOrder that contains nodes (like loop and xor) and edges between them.

So that should model the sequence.

For the fair model:

The XOR is removed. After SkillAssessment, a single CulturalFitCheck activity, then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So:

- ReceiveApplication

- Loop Operator (same as before)

- SkillAssessment

- CulturalFitCheck (single activity, not in an XOR)

- ManagerialReview

- FinalDecision

But how to model this in the same structure? The only difference is that instead of an XOR operator, there's a Transition("CulturalFitCheck").

Wait, but in the fair model, the XOR doesn't exist. So the structure would have CulturalFitCheck as a node in the partial order sequence.

So code:

A = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
loop_part = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [Transition("DataCompletenessCheck"), Transition("RequestMoreInfo")])
skill = Transition("SkillAssessment")
cultural = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
manager = Transition("ManagerialReview")
final = Transition("FinalDecision")

root = StrictPartialOrder([A, loop_part, skill, cultural, manager, final])
root.order.add_edge(A, loop_part)
root.order.add_edge(loop_part, skill)
root.order.add_edge(skill, cultural)
root.order.add_edge(cultural, manager)
root.order.add_edge(manager, final)

But in this case, the CulturalFitCheck is a single activity, no branching.

But wait, in the original problem statement, the second model should still have the same steps but without the unfair branch. So the CulturalFitCheck in the fair model is a standard evaluation without any affiliation check.

Therefore, the two models differ in whether the Cultural Fit step is a single activity or an XOR choice between two paths.

Thus, the first model has the XOR, the second does not.

I think this is correct.

Now, checking for any possible errors. For example, the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. The loop operator has two children: the first is the condition check (A), then the activity to request more info (B). The loop structure is: execute A, then either exit or do B and then A again. So the loop_part would be the DataCompletenessCheck (A) and RequestMoreInfo (B). That seems right.

Another thing: the XOR in the first model is an exclusive choice. The problem says that it's an XOR choice between the two paths. So the OperatorPOWL with XOR and two children.

Yes. Then, after either of the XOR branches, the process proceeds to Managerial Review. So in the POWL model, the XOR node is followed by ManagerialReview. Since in the partial order, the XOR node must come before ManagerialReview.

In the code, the XOR operator's parent StrictPartialOrder has an edge from the XOR node to ManagerialReview. That's handled in the unfair model.

So both models should be structured correctly.

I think that's the way to go. Now, writing the code for both models, following the example provided.

To model the hiring process of **GlobalTeq Solutions** using **POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language)**, we define two distinct workflows:

---

##  **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model reflects the biased hiring process where **community affiliations** or **local background** provide an implicit advantage during the cultural fit evaluation. It introduces an **XOR branch** after the skill assessment, allowing for two distinct paths: a **standard cultural fit check** and a **community affiliation check** that subtly favors certain applicants.

###  Structure:

- **ReceiveApplication**  **Loop** (DataCompletenessCheck  RequestMoreInfo)  
-  **SkillAssessment**  
-  **XOR** (CulturalFitCheck **or** CommunityAffiliationCheck)  
-  **ManagerialReview**  
-  **FinalDecision**

This XOR branching is where **unfairness** may occur, as the **CommunityAffiliationCheck** can introduce unconscious or conscious bias.

---

###  Code (with Unfairness):

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Define XOR between standard and community-based cultural fit checks
xor_cultural_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check, community_affiliation_check])

# Create root partial order and define execution order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_application,
    loop,
    skill_assessment,
    xor_cultural_check,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Add order relations
root.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_cultural_check)
root.order.add_edge(xor_cultural_check, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

##  **POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This model reflects a **fair and transparent** hiring process where **no community-based advantage** is given. The **cultural fit evaluation** is **uniform** for all applicants. There is **no XOR branch**—only a **single cultural fit check** is performed for everyone.

###  Structure:

- **ReceiveApplication**  **Loop** (DataCompletenessCheck  RequestMoreInfo)  
-  **SkillAssessment**  
-  **CulturalFitCheck**  
-  **ManagerialReview**  
-  **FinalDecision**

This model eliminates the **XOR branch**, thereby removing the potential source of bias.

###  Code (without Unfairness):

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Create root partial order and define execution order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_application,
    loop,
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_fit_check,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Add order relations
root.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

##  Summary

| Model Type | Cultural Fit Evaluation | Bias Introduced? | XOR Branch? | Uniform Evaluation? |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| With Unfairness | XOR: CulturalFitCheck OR CommunityAffiliationCheck |  Yes |  Yes |  No |
| Without Unfairness | Single CulturalFitCheck |  No |  No |  Yes |

These models clearly illustrate how **structural differences** in workflow design can either **introduce or eliminate bias** in hiring processes. The **XOR branch** in the first model is the key mechanism where **subtle unfairness** can occur, while the second model ensures **equitable treatment** for all applicants.
