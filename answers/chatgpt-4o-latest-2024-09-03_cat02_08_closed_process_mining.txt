Certainly! Here's a conceptual breakdown with the **opposite** concepts and **more general** concepts for the terms you have listed, specifically tailored to the process mining field:

---

### 1. **Automated Process Discovery**  
   - **Opposite Concept**:  
     **Manual Process Modeling**  
     In manual process modeling, human analysts manually design and document workflows or processes based on their understanding (often, using interviews or observations), without relying on algorithms or data-driven methods. This is inherently less automated and depends on tacit knowledge instead of event logs or automated procedures.
   
   - **More General Concept**:  
     **Process Understanding**  
     As a more general concept, "process understanding" encapsulates all approaches to gaining insights into processes. This could include automatic, semi-automatic, or manual approaches, ranging from formal discovery techniques to subjective interpretation and observation methods.

---

### 2. **Predictive Monitoring**  
   - **Opposite Concept**:  
     **Reactive Monitoring**  
     Reactive monitoring refers to analyzing a process only after issues or events have already occurred. Instead of leveraging predictions, it waits for incidents or deviations to arise and then provides analyses post-facto.
   
   - **More General Concept**:  
     **Process Monitoring**  
     As a broader term, process monitoring encompasses both predictive (preventive) and reactive methods used to observe, track, and respond to events within a business process.

### 3. **Bottom-up Discovery**  
   - **Opposite Concept**:  
     **Top-down Process Design**  
     Top-down process design involves starting from high-level business goals and specifications, where processes are strategically defined in a structured manner by management, rather than emerging from the data or actual process instances at the lower level (as in bottom-up discovery).
   
   - **More General Concept**:  
     **Process Modeling**  
     This general concept includes all approaches to understanding and representing processes, whether by analyzing logs (bottom-up) or creating processes from business requirements (top-down).

### 4. **Process Simulation**  
   - **Opposite Concept**:  
     **Real-world Implementation**  
     Real-world implementation refers to the execution of business processes as they actually occur in live environments, without being artificially modeled or simulated beforehand. It's about dealing directly with processes in operation (and their inherent unpredictabilities).
   
   - **More General Concept**:  
     **Process Analysis**  
     "Process analysis" includes various techniques to understand, explore, or validate processes, whether through simulation (predicting outcomes in a controlled environment) or through other analytical methods applied to real-world processes.

---

### 5. **Process Efficiency**  
   - **Opposite Concept**:  
     **Process Redundancy/Overhead**  
     Process redundancy or overhead refers to extraneous or inefficient steps that add little or no value to the process, thereby hampering efficiency. It highlights inefficiencies rather than optimizing processes.
   
   - **More General Concept**:  
     **Process Performance**  
     Process performance is a more encompassing term that evaluates various aspects of a process, including efficiency, speed, and effectiveness. It includes evaluating multiple KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) touching on different process goals.

---

### 6. **Real-time Monitoring**  
   - **Opposite Concept**:  
     **Delayed or Batch Monitoring**  
     This involves analyzing process data retrospectively or at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, etc.) instead of continuously. In delayed monitoring, data isn't collected or acted upon in real-time but aggregated and analyzed later.
   
   - **More General Concept**:  
     **Process Monitoring**  
     As with the earlier discussion, process monitoring represents the overarching idea, encompassing both real-time and batch monitoring, as well as any form of observing processes to gather insight.

These opposites and generalizations help provide alternative views as well as more comprehensive frameworks for understanding various key aspects in the field of process mining and process management.
