 The pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process that starts with receiving a customer request and follows through various stages, including validation, feasibility analysis, checks, approvals, and confirmation, with different paths depending on the type of request (standard or custom). Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Start Event:** The process begins when a customer request is received.

2. **Task A: Receive Customer Request:** The first step is to acknowledge the incoming request and log it into the system for processing.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type:** This is an exclusive gateway (XOR) that decides the path based on the type of request. There are two types of requests considered: Standard and Custom.

   - **Standard Path:**
     1. **Task B1: Perform Standard Validation:** The request undergoes a routine validation to ensure it meets predefined criteria or standards.
     2. **Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks:** This parallel gateway (AND) splits the process into two concurrent tasks that must both be completed.
         - **Task C1: Credit Check:** A check is performed to ensure the customer is creditworthy.
         - **Task C2: Inventory Check:** An inventory check is performed to confirm the requested items are in stock.
     3. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join):** The process waits for both checks to complete and then proceeds.
     4. **Task D: Calculate Delivery Date:** Based on the results of the checks, the system calculates a realistic delivery date.

   - **Custom Path:**
     1. **Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis:** For custom requests, a more detailed analysis is conducted to assess whether the customization is possible.
     2. **Gateway (XOR): Is Customization Feasible?:** Another exclusive gateway that diverges the process based on the feasibility outcome.
         - **[If Yes] Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation:** If customization is feasible, a tailored quotation is prepared for the customer.
         - **[If No] Task E2: Send Rejection Notice:** If customization is not feasible, a notice is sent to the customer explaining the inability to fulfill the request. This leads to an End Event for the custom path.

4. **Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Needed?:** After completing the standard or custom path tasks, the process checks if managerial approval is required based on predefined rules or thresholds.

   - **[If Yes] Task F: Obtain Manager Approval:** If approval is needed, the process waits for the manager to review and either approve or reject the request.
     1. **Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Granted?:** Post-approval review, another exclusive gateway determines the next steps.
        - **[If Yes] Task G: Generate Final Invoice:** If the manager grants approval, the final invoice is generated for the customer.
        - **[If No] Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions:** If the manager does not grant approval, the process loops back for re-evaluation. This could involve revisiting Task E1 for the custom path or Task D for the standard path to adjust conditions or explore alternatives.
   
   - **[If No Approval Needed] Task G: Generate Final Invoice:** If no approval is needed, the process proceeds directly to generating the final invoice.

5. **Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer:** Once the final invoice is generated, a confirmation is sent to the customer, finalizing the agreement or order.

6. **End Event:** The process concludes after the confirmation is sent to the customer.

In summary, the process handles customer requests by first identifying the type of request and then following a standard or custom path accordingly. Standard requests go through routine validation and parallel checks, while custom requests require a feasibility analysis that could lead to either a custom quotation or a rejection. Depending on the need for managerial approval, additional steps may be required, including re-evaluation in case of disapproval. The process is designed to ensure that all customer requests are carefully evaluated, checked for feasibility and creditworthiness, and subjected to necessary approvals before finalizing the order with the customer.
