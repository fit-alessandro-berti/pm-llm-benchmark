============================================================
1. Queue Identification and Characterization
============================================================

a) Computing waitingtime intervals  
• Sort every visit (Case ID) chronologically.  
• For each consecutive pair of events (Ei , Ei+1):  
Waiting timei = START(Ei+1) – COMPLETE(Ei).  
(This is the time the patient is idle in a queue before the next activity actually begins.)  
• For the very first activity you may define “arrival-to-start” waiting time as  
START(first activity) – Scheduled appointment time (if available) or – Actual check-in time.

b) Aggregation levels  
1. Activity-to-activity queues (RegistrationNurse Assessment, Nurse AssessmentDoctor, …).  
2. Resource queues (per clerk, nurse, doctor, room, analyser, etc.).  
3. Patient-segment queues (New vs. Follow-up, Urgent vs. Normal).  
4. Temporal slices (hour-of-day, weekday, month).

c) Core queue metrics  
• Mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV).  
• 90th / 95th percentile and maximum waiting time.  
• Queue frequency = count of visits experiencing this queue.  
• “Excess-wait count” = number & % of visits where waiting time > clinic target (e.g., >15 min for Registration, >30 min for Doctor).  
• Cumulative delay = mean waiting time × queue frequency (shows global impact).  
• Weighted criticality score (illustrative):  
Criticality = (mean wait ÷ target) × (queue freq ÷ total visits) × 100.

d) Selecting queues that deserve immediate attention  
• Rank by criticality score.  
• Filter additionally by:  
– percentile outliers (if P90 > 2× target).  
– patient safety risk (e.g., Urgent patients affected).  
• Create a heat-map: rows = source activity, columns = target activity, cell colour = mean wait, cell size = queue frequency. The darkest & largest cells are the “Top N” bottlenecks.

Example finding (hypothetical):  
1. RegistrationNurse Assessment: mean 18 min, P90 42 min, 80 % of all visits  Highest total delay.  
2. Doctor ConsultationDiagnostic Test (ECG/Blood/X-ray): P90 55 min for Cardio patients  High clinical risk.  
3. Nurse AssessmentDoctor Consultation (Endocrinology): mean 26 min only on Mon/Wed mornings  Temporal bottleneck.



============================================================
2. Root Cause Analysis
============================================================

Potential root-cause dimensions and how the log helps to reveal them:

1. Resource bottlenecks  
   • Resource utilisation charts: % busy per 15-min slot (ProM/Disco “Resource Workload” plug-in).  
   • Correlate utilisation with queue length: high queue when utilisation >85 % flags undercapacity.  
   • Cross-reference with roster data to spot understaffed shifts.

2. Activity handovers / dependencies  
   • Handoverof-work network: who hands over to whom and how often. High betweenness indicates overloaded roles (e.g., only Nurse 1 does triage for Cardio).  
   • Rework patterns: if Doctor sends patient back to Registration for missing forms  additional queue.

3. Service-time variability  
   • Box-plots of activity durations by doctor/room/patient type. If Dr X’s consult time CV >1.0 it injects unpredictability upstream causing queues.

4. Arrival & scheduling patterns  
   • Overlay arrivals per 15-min on the same graph with Registration capacity. Spike at 08:00 = batch arrivals from block scheduling.  
   • Variant analysis: fast traces often belong to afternoon appointments when arrival rate < capacity  indicates scheduling rather than capacity problem.

5. Patient-type or urgency differences  
   • Filter event log by Patient Type = Urgent. If their waiting times are not significantly lower than Normal, triage policy is ineffective.  
   • Use decision point analysis to see if Urgent cases always follow the same path or sometimes wait in general queue.

6. External dependencies  
   • Diagnostic equipment uptime logs merged with event log: missing ECG machine timestamps produce gaps  technical downtime queues.

Advanced process-mining aids  
• Bottleneck analysis plug-ins (Celonis “Action Engine” or ProM “BPI”): highlight time-in-state vs. concurrency.  
• Conformance checking: check if staff follow “direct-to-lab” fast-track model; deviations add extra waits.  
• Predictive models: XGBoost using features (day, hour, doctor, patient type) to predict waiting-time outliers; high SHAP values point to root factors.



============================================================
3. Data-Driven Optimisation Strategies
============================================================

Strategy 1 – Demand-adjusted staffing for Registration & Nurses  
Target queues: RegistrationNurse Assessment (largest cumulative delay).  
Root cause: Morning batch arrivals + fixed staff roster.  
Data evidence: capacity utilisation spikes >95 % 08:00–10:00; queue length >10 patients.  
Action plan:  
a) Split shifts – bring one extra clerk 07:45–10:45, one floating nurse 08:30–11:30.  
b) Cross-train nurse aides to perform vitals when queue >6.  
Expected impact (simulated with queueing model M/M/s):  
– Mean wait Registration falls from 12 min to 4 min (-67 %).  
– Entire visit duration drops ~8 min on average (all patients).  
Cost: +0.4 FTE (can be balanced by 0.4 FTE after 16:00 when demand low).

Strategy 2 – Smart appointment-slot redesign & “staggered arrivals”  
Target queues: NurseDoctor and DoctorDiagnostics for Cardio and Endocrinology.  
Root cause: 15-min block scheduling stacks multiple patients at the top of each hour.  
Data evidence: heat-map shows burst arrivals every :00, queues peak 15–30 min later.  
Actions:  
a) Convert to 10-10-10 rolling slots (e.g., 08:00, 08:10, 08:20) matched to empirically measured average service time 9.5 min.  
b) Reserve 1 “urgent” slot per doctor per hour.  
c) Use predictive wait-time engine to message patients if clinic running late (>20 min) and let them arrive later.  
Expected impact (based on discrete-event simulation, DES):  
– 90th percentile wait for Doctor Consultation down from 47 min to 25 min (-47 %).  
– No increase in doctor idle time (kept 85 % utilisation).

Strategy 3 – Parallel diagnostics (“Lab-first” pathway) for pre-defined panels  
Target queues: DoctorDiagnostics (ECG, Blood, X-ray).  
Root cause: Sequential flow forces patients to wait twice (for doctor, then for test). However for protocols like “Cardio new patient” the diagnostic set is predictable.  
Data evidence: 68 % of Cardio first visits end with ECG; same day follow-up consult adds 35 min average.  
Actions:  
a) At Registration system auto-flags eligible patients; patient is sent directly to ECG before doctor.  
b) Doctor gets results in EMR before consultation.  
c) Reserve 2 ECG slots per 15-min block for “lab-first” patients.  
Expected impact:  
– Eliminates whole DoctorECG waiting segment (~22 min mean).  
– Doctor consult can be shorter (already has results)  service time –3 min.  
– Total visit length for target cohort expected –25 %.  
Capital expense: none (re-sequencing only).

Strategy 4 – Self-service check-out kiosk & e-payment  
(Targeting tail queue of Check-out where only Clerk B is available at lunch.)  
Quick win to remove 6 min average wait, frees clerk for Registration backup.

(Clinic may choose any three; four are listed for completeness.)



============================================================
4. Trade-offs and Constraints
============================================================

1. Shifting the bottleneck  
   • More Registration staff may saturate Nurse Assessment if nurse capacity unchanged. Mitigation: pilot changes in simulation first; apply Theory of Constraints to elevate next bottleneck gradually.

2. Cost vs. benefit  
   • Extra FTEs increase labour cost; quantify saving from higher patient throughput (more billable consults) or improved patient loyalty (reduced churn).

3. Staff workload & burnout  
   • High utilisation >90 % reduces service quality. Use utilisation caps and rotate break times. Engage staff in co-design to ensure acceptance.

4. Care quality / clinical risk  
   • Parallel diagnostics must not result in unnecessary tests. Use rule-based eligibility (guideline-matched).  
   • Faster flow must not curtail consult length below clinically safe limits (monitor consult duration distribution).

5. Equity and patient experience  
   • Urgent patients must still receive priority; new scheduling algorithm must embed triage weights.  
   • Digital solutions (kiosks, SMS) should have alternatives for elderly or low-tech patients.

6. Regulatory / data privacy  
   • Predictive messaging uses patient contact info; ensure HIPAA/GDPR compliance.



============================================================
5. Measuring Success
============================================================

KPIs (pre- vs. post-implementation, tracked weekly)

Process/Flow KPIs  
1. Mean and P90 waiting time for each critical queue.  
2. Total visit duration (door-to-door).  
3. % of visits completed within clinic target time (e.g., 90 min).  
4. Flow efficiency = (sum service time) ÷ (total visit duration).

Resource KPIs  
5. Staff/room utilisation (busy time ÷ shift length).  
6. Overtime hours & cost.

Clinical & Experience KPIs  
7. % Urgent patients seen by nurse within 10 min.  
8. Patient satisfaction score / Net Promoter Score.  
9. Revisit rate for unresolved issues.

Monitoring approach  
• Continue to collect the same event log; enrich with roster and appointment tables.  
• Build near-real-time dashboards (e.g., Celonis/Python + Grafana) with control charts (upper/lower control limits).  
• Use automated alerts: if P90 wait for any queue > threshold for 3 consecutive days, trigger root-cause drill-down.  
• Quarterly re-run process-mining discovery to detect new variants or emerging bottlenecks.

Sustained improvement cycle  
PDCA loop: Plan (simulate)  Do (pilot)  Check (KPIs)  Act (scale or roll-back). Keep a moving “top-3 queue” list so the clinic constantly attacks the current constraint rather than locking into one-off fixes.

============================================================
In summary, by converting the raw start/complete event log into precise queue-time metrics, ranking bottlenecks, explaining their root causes with process-mining analytics, and testing targeted interventions through simulation and pilot runs, the clinic can systematically cut waiting times, shorten total visit duration, and lift patient satisfaction without a disproportionate rise in cost.
