1. **Violations of Normative Rules:**

   - **Case 2:**
     - Violation: The Credit Check (08:20) was performed after the Risk Assessment (09:00), which contradicts the normative rule that states "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."
     - Justification/Interpretation: It seems an oversight or mismanagement led to the reversal of these steps. This could potentially result in incomplete or incorrect risk assessment due to lack of credit history information at the time of evaluation.

   - **Case 2:**
     - Violation: Finalize Documentation (10:00) was carried out after Loan Decision (09:30, Rejected), which is not allowed according to the normative rules.
     - Justification/Interpretation: This might be a mistake or misunderstanding of the process, likely due to automated systems trying to finalize all cases uniformly without checking for rejection status.

2. **Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions:**

   - **Case 1:**
     - Failure: Inform Applicant (13:00) happened more than 48 hours after Loan Decision (11:00), which is later than the recommended 48-hour window for prompt notification.
     - Note: This does not constitute a severe violation but represents suboptimal behavior as it may lead to customer dissatisfaction due to prolonged uncertainty.

   - **Case 3:**
     - Failure: Credit Check (10:00) was performed more than two days after Application Received (09:00), exceeding the recommended 24-hour window for prompt check initiation.
     - Note: Similar to the above, this does not signify a severe breach but indicates less-than-optimal efficiency in processing applications, potentially delaying the overall timeline.

   - **Case 3:**
     - Failure: Inform Applicant (16:00) happened more than two days after Loan Decision (12:00), exceeding the recommended 48-hour window for prompt notification.
     - Note: Again, this is a desideratum violation indicating suboptimal timing but not severe enough to warrant serious concern.

   - **Case 3:**
     - Failure: No Follow-up Call was conducted before Closing Case (10:00), missing an opportunity for final alignment with the applicant.
     - Note: This does not represent a violation of strict rules but signifies missed opportunity for enhanced customer service and case clarity.

The provided event log shows how some processes adhered strictly to the outlined normative rules while others exhibited deviations, either violating the rules or failing to meet desiderata conditions. These instances highlight areas where process improvements could be made to ensure higher efficiency and customer satisfaction without contravening established protocols.
