Okay, so I need to create an event log for process mining using the tables provided. The instructions say to use the order_id as the case ID, which I got. The main task is to convert each step in the order's lifecycle into events with the right details. Let me start by looking at each table and figure out how they connect.

First, the Orders table has the order creation event. Each row will have an "Order Created" activity with the order_date, and the sales person as the resource. That's straightforward.

Next, the Order Lines table has items picked. Each record there corresponds to an item being picked. The activity would be "Item Picked" but since each order can have multiple items, I need to make sure each item picking is a separate event. So for order 1001, there are two line items, each with their own picking dates. Each should be an event with "Items Picked" as the activity, timestamp as item_picking_date, and Resource from picker_id. The item_id and quantity could be other attributes. But wait, should the activity name include the item? Like "Item ITEM-001 Picked"? The prompt says to derive activities from the tables, so maybe better as "Item Picked" since all entries are items being picked. Hmm, but maybe the activity is more general. Since all rows are "items picked", just having "Items Picked" works, but the item specific info can be in the attributes. The prompt also mentions that multiple orders might have multiple picking dates, but it's okay because they are separate lines.

Then the Delivery table: Each delivery_id might have two events per delivery, "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived". For each delivery record, we have two events: one at delivery_dispatch_date and another at delivery_arrival_date. So for order 1001, there's one delivery. So two events: dispatch on 2024-01-03 and arrival on 2024-01-05. Each with activity names "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived", and the carrier as a resource? The carrier is an ID here, but there's a resources table; maybe use the carrier name instead? Wait, the delivery note can be an additional attribute. The carrier_id can be linked to the resources table to get the carrier name. But since the resources have the carrier's name under resource_name, like CR-01 maps to GlobalTransport. So for the resource column in the event log, maybe the carrier's name as the resource? That would make sense since the delivery was dispatched via them. So in activity names for delivery events, the resource can be the carrier.

Then the Invoice Table: Each invoice is an "Invoice Issued" event with the invoice_issue_date, and the billing_person_id as the resource. The invoice_id and amount are attributes. Since one order can have multiple invoices (like order 1002 has two invoices), each invoice gets its own event. 

Lastly, Payments: Each payment is a "Payment Received" event with the payment_date, and perhaps the payment method is an attribute. The resource here might be the payment processor, but there's no info on who processed it (like the resource IDs related to payments). The prompt says if available, include. Since payment tables don't have a resource, maybe leave it blank or infer from invoice's billing person? Not sure, maybe it's better to just omit the resource here unless there's a known process, but according to the data given, it's not provided. So just leave it empty.

Now, combining all these tables into one event log structured as a table with columns: Case ID (order_id), Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, and other attributes as needed.

Let me go through each table step by step and create entries:

Start with Orders table:

For each row in Orders:
- Activity: "Order Created" (from order_date)
- Timestamp: order_date
- Resource: sales_person_id (could use the actual name via resources table, but the Resources table lists the role, so maybe the sales_person's resource ID is in the resources table, so SP-001 maps to Alice Brown. So the resource for "Order Created" would be the resource_name from Resources where resource_id is sales_person_id. But the prompt says to map to a resource if available, so yes, better to use the name.)

Wait, the user said to include resource as department/user/system, so need to look into Resources table for that. For example, when using sales_person_id (like SP-001), the resource would be the resource_name (Alice Brown) and role (Sales Person). So using Alice Brown would be better as the resource here. But maybe the resource column can just have the full name. Let's assume that's the case. 

Now, processing Order Lines:

For each row in Order Lines:
- Activity: "Item Picked"
- Timestamp: item_picking_date
- Resource: resource_name from picker_id mapping (like WH-001 is David Lin)
- Attributes: item_id, quantity

Wait, the product table might have info, but the prompt allows adding other attributes. So item_picking_date's date is timestamp, and the item details can be included.

Delivery:

Each delivery has two events per delivery_id. Since each delivery is a shipment, for each delivery record:
- One event: "Order Dispatched" with delivery_dispatch_date, Resource: carrier name
- Another event: "Order Arrived" with delivery_arrival_date and same resource (carrier)

_invoice_issue_date:

For each invoice row:
- Activity "Invoice Issued", date is invoice_issue_date, resource is the billing clerk name (via resources table for billing_person_id)

_payment rows:

Each payment is one event "Payment Received", with payment_date, the payment method and reference as attributes. The resource might not be available here unless specified.

Also, make sure to include all possible entries for each order. Let me check for each order the full set, and order them by timestamp.

Now, I'll need to process all entries, merging from all tables and then sort them by order and timestamp.

Let me take one order and see:

Take order_id 1001:

Orders table:
- Order Created on 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z by SP-001 (Alice Brown)

Order Lines:
- ITEM-001: picked on 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z by WH-001 (David Lin)
- ITEM-002: picked on 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z by WH-002 (Eva)

Delivery Table entry for DLV-5001 (delivery_id):
- Dispatched on 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z - so event is "Order Dispatchered" and "Order Arrived" on 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z via carrier Global Transport (CR-01 is GlobalTransport from Resources).

Invoice for 1001 is INV-1001, issued on 2024-01-06 by BL-001 (Gina).

Payment for INV-1001: PAY-2001 on 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z via Credit Card.

So the events for 1001 are ordered as:

1. Order created (Jan 1st)
2. Item picked for ITEM-001 (Jan 2nd 10:15)
3. Item picked ITEM-002 (Jan 2 11:00)
4. Dispatched (Jan 3)
5. Arrived (Jan 5)
6. Invoices issued (Jan6)
7. Payment received (Jan 10)

Wait, the payment is on Jan10, so invoices are issued before payments. 

Other orders similar. Now, I have to ensure all activities are considered, even those with multiple entries, like orders with multiple deliveries or invoices.

Now, building the table step by step.

Trying to make entries for each of the orders, line them up:

Starting with Order 1001:

Order table:
| case_id | activity | timestamp | resource | other |
1001, "Order Created", 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z, Alice Brown (SP-001 in resources)

Order Lines:
ITEM-001 (quantity 2): Activity "Item Picked", 2024-01-02T10:15:00, David Lin (WH-001)
Then Line 2: ITEM-002, quantity 1 picked at 2024-01-02T11:00, Eva Johnson (WH-002)

Delivery events:
For delivery DLV-5001: 
- "Order Dispatched", dispatch date: Jan3 08:30Z. Resource: GlobalTransport
- "Order Arrived" Jan5 14:45 with same carrier.

Invoice events:
Invoice INV-1001 issue data: Jan6 09:00 by BL-001 (Gina Carter)
Payment: PAY-2001, payment on Jan10.

So all for 1001 done.

Order 1002:

Orders:
- Created by SP-002 (Bob Smith) on 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z

Order Lines:
ITEM-003 (quantity4) picked at 01/03/09:45 by WH-002 (Eva)
ITEM-005 (2) picked at 01/03/10:00 by WH-001 (David)

Delivery has two shipments:

First DLV-5002:
Dispatched 4th 7:20 via CR-02 (FastShip). Arrival 7 16:10.

Second DLV-5003: dispatch 04/05/07:00 via CR-01 (Global), arrival 08 10:00.

These mean two Dispatched events and two Arrival.

So for each delivery, two events:

For DLV-5002: dispatch and arrival (carrier FastShip)
DLV-5003: dispatch and arrival via GlobalTransport (CR-01 again)

Order 1002's events:

1. Order created on 2nd
Item Picking for items 003 and 005 on 3rd
then dispatch and arrival for each delivery

Then invoices: INV-1002 on 08th (issued by BL-002,Harry), and INV-1003 on 10-11 (BL-002). So two invoice events.

Each invoice has its own payment:
INV-1002's payment is on Jan12, method wire transfer.
INV-1003 is paid on Jan15 via Check.

So for payment of each invoice, each is separate.

Order 1003:

Order created via SP-002 (Bob Smith) on 01/03 10:00.

Order Lines:

Item-002 (1) picked at 2024-01-05T15:30 by WH-003 (Frank), and item-006 (3) at 15:45 by WH-001.

Delivery entry: One delivery DLV-5004: dispatched on 06/07:30 (CR-03 AirExpress), arrived on 7/20.

Invoice: INV-1004 on Jan9 by BL-001 (Gina).

Payment on Jan 11 with Credit Card.

Order1004:

Hmm looking at Orders, the order_id 1004's order date is 4th Jan 14:15.

Order Lines has ITEM-001 (5) picked at 2024-01-06 08:00 by WH-002 (Eva). 

Delivery Table doesn’t have a DLV for order id 1004? Looking at Delivery table data, does 1004 have any entries?

Looking back:

Delivery Table entries:

DLV-5001: 1001

DLV-5002: 1002

DLV-5003: 1002 again

DLV-5004: 1003

DLV-5005: 1005

Wait there's no delivery record for 1004? Check the Delivery data again.

The given Delivery table for 1005 is DLV-5005 (another entry).

Wait looking:

The Delivery Table has entries for orders 1004... Let me check.

The Delivery table's data:

| delivery_id | order_id | ... |
Looking at the data provided for Delivery Table:

The rows listed after:

DLV-5001 for 1001,

DLV-5002 for 1002,

DLV-5003 still 1002,

DLV-5004: 1003,

Listen, the next row after 5004 is DLV-5005 for 1005.

Thus, order 1004 has no delivery records? So no "dispatch" or "arrival" events for it. Hmm, perhaps an oversight here. So I need to check whether order 1004 was indeed not delivered, but the prompt says to include all events even if data is missing, but since the entry isn't in the table, we can’t infer. So absence of delivery records implies these steps weren’t recorded, so only up to that point?

Well, according to the datasets provided, the order 1004's only data is in Order Lines: the item picking.

So for order 1004's events:

Order created (SP-003, Charlie Kim), then Items Picked for ITEM-001 on Jan6 08:00 by Eva (WH-002)

No delivery event, so not included. So the process stops there?

But that might be an important point. However, according to the instructions, we need to include "every event for every order_id". So since there is no delivery record, those steps (dispatch/arrival) are just omitted.

Then Invoice: looking at Invoices table, order 1004 has invoice INV-1004 (yes, look back):

Invoice rows:

INV-1004 is for order1003. Wait, let me check:

In Invoices table:

| invoice_id | order_id | ... |
Looking from Invoices:

- invoice 1001 for 1001

- 1002 for 1002,

- 1003 also 1002,

- 1004 for 1003,

Wait, no invoice for order 1004? So 1004 has no invoice issued? That's possible but that complicates things. 

Wait the presented data for the invoice table:

The Invoices table:

The first entry is: INV-1001 for 1001,

Then INV-1002 and -1003 for 1002,

Then INV-1004 for 1003,

Then 1005's invoice is 1005.

Wait, No invoice record for order 1004. So they didn't get an invoice, so no invoice events. Also no payments.

So order 1004's process might be hanging, but according to the data given, we have to include what's there.

Proceeding.

Then Payment for order1004 isn’t there. So the events for order1004 are:

- Order Created (SP-003's name?), 

- Item Picked event on Jan6 8am by Eva,

But nothing beyond that. Maybe the order was never delivered because the delivery wasn't recorded, so there are only 2 events. So that's okay.

Proceeding.

Order 1005:

From Orders table:

order_date 5th,1/5 at 8:45 by SP-001 (Alice)

Order Lines:

Two items (item007 and item002) picked on 6th (09:30 and 09:45), by Frank and Eva.

Delivery for DLV-5005 (Jan7 dispatch and arrival 9th with CR-02 (FastShip)

Invoice: INV-1005 issued on Jan10 by BL-003.

Payment is Jan15 via CC.

Alright, proceeding.

Now, I need to structure each of these into the event log. 

Finally, I also need to include Resources info where possible.

Let me start building the final table by iterating each case (order) then events.

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with Order 1001:

Case 1001:

Events:

09:00 – Order Created by Alice Brown (Sales Person)

Then, two item picked events:

1st: 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z picked by David Lin (Resource: David Lin)

Second: 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z picked by Eva Johnson (Resource: Eva Johnson)

Then:

Dispatch 01/03/08:30 by GlobalTransport (carrier)

Arrive 01/05 14:45

Invoice issued on 01/06 by Gina Carter,

payment received on 01/10.

So the Event log entries would have:

Row 1: 

| 1001 | Order Created | 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z | Alice Brown | Sales Person details (but maybe the "Resource/Actor" column can just have Alice Brown) | 

Other attributes could include customer info, but the user says "other attributes if available." Since instructions don’t require them, maybe just include in other attributes relevant ones like:

Possibly, in "Other Attributes" field, putting the sales_person and customer info? Alternatively, the other attributes can be added as separate columns, but the user wants the table in markdown. But the user's instructions say the output format should have the four required columns plus other attributes as necessary, creating columns as needed.

Wait, the problem's task says "include other attributes if available".

Wait, the output needs to have columns: Case ID, Activity, Timestamp, Resource, and "Other Attributes". So the table must have those columns, but the "Other Attributes" can be a catch-all field, or multiple columns. The instruction says to consider the minimal required columns as listed (4):

- Case ID  
- Activity  
- Timestamp  
-Resource (optional)  
-Other Attributes (if available, i.e., optional but can include)
Wait, the user says, "Other Attributes (if available): Any additional relevant data."

Possibly, "Other Attributes" can be separated in multiple columns, but in the output format they just want a table with the four columns plus any other attributes they can think of. Since the user might want all relevant data into multiple columns like item picked, carrier, etc., but the exact structure isn't specified, so we need to make a table where in 'Other Attributes' cell we can list any relevant data as key-value pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps, in the table each row can have columns like:

- Case ID: order_id
- Activity Name: like "Order Created", "Orders Dispatched", etc
- Timestamp: datetime
- Resource (actor): who did it
- Other attributes: like quantity, item_id for item picked events, carrier_id, invoice amount, payment method, etc.

To make this manageable, perhaps create columns like:

 - Additional columns for specific attributes? But the output format says to present as table with the four columns plus others as needed.

Wait, perhaps the user expects that "Other Attributes" are part of the table as additional columns, but since it's unclear, maybe best to make a wide table where relevant fields are included as columns. But the problem says to include 'other attributes (if available)". 

Alternatively, to avoid making a table with too many columns, list the attributes in the "Other Attributes" column as semicolon separated or in a composite column, but likely better to split them into their own columns.

Let me parse the possible attributes for each activity.

Examples:

- For "Items Picked" events: item_id, quantity (from order_lines), and perhaps who picked it, but the picker is in the resource.

Wait, but resource is already the picker here, so quantity and item id would be additional attributes.

For Invoice issues: the invoice_amount and billing_person_id? But billing_person's name is in resource. The invoice id is important, so invoice_id is an other attribute.

In Delivery's dispatch: the delivery note (like "Normal route") and the carrier's name (already in resource via carrier name).

Hmm. It's getting complex, but since the prompt says any relevant data, we can choose which attributes to include as long as they are available and relevant.

Perhaps, when unsure, just include meaningful attributes as separate columns. Here's how I might handle each activity's attributes:

- "Order Created" doesn't need anything beyond the CSV data, but maybe include customer_type, sales_person role (but that's resource name's role, perhaps redundant). Maybe only include the customer_id, but perhaps not necessary unless useful.

Alternatively, stick to the columns listed in the problem's output. Let me see:

The output must have columns at minimum the four required, but others can be added. So perhaps:

Case ID | Activity | Timestamp | Actor/Resource | Other cols like item_id, quantity (for picking), etc.

Since it's markdown table, need to structure that.

Alternatively, in each event's other attributes, include the necessary details. For instance:

- For "Item Picked" activity: include item_id and quantity as other attributes (maybe in one field or spread).
- Invoice events: invoice_id, amount, etc.
- Payments: payment_method, etc.

So, the structure would need to allow for that, creating columns:

Perhaps the final table has these columns:

Case ID | Activity | Timestamp | Resource/Actor | Item ID | Quantity | Invoice ID | Invoice Amount | Payment Method | Payment Reference | Delivery Note | Delivery Carrier | etc...

But that might get too many columns. Alternatively, present all other attributes in a single column, but it's hard to read.

Alternatively, use standard process mining event logs usually include Case ID, Activity, Timestamp, and maybe originator. The desired user perhaps expects only the required columns and then key attributes in separate columns.

Considering the problem says "structured table (in Markdown format)", with each row a event. Let me proceed to build the table line by line, ensuring that columns are properly named and include all necessary info.

Proceeding step by step:

First, list all events for all orders in order.

Case 1001:

Order_id=1001

1. Order Created - Activity: Order Created - order_date is 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z, resource Alice Brown (SP-001's name)

Other attributes: (maybe from Orders table: customer_type (Retail), sales_person_id (already in resource?), but perhaps include customer_id also as attribute, so customer_id: CUST-ABC, customer_type: Retail.

So,

| 1001 | Order Created | 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z | Alice Brown | Customer ID=CUST-ABC; Customer Type=Retail |

2. Item Picked (ITEM-001):

Activity: "Item Picked" 

Timestamp: 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z

Resource: David Lin

Attributes: item_id: ITEM-001; quantity: 2

| 1001 | Item Picked | 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z | David Lin | item_id: ITEM-001, quantity: 2 |

3. Item Picked for ITEM-002 (second item):

Activity same, timestamp 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z by Eva Johnson. 

| 1001 | Item Picked | 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z | Eva Johnson | item_id: ITEM-002, quantity: 1 |

4. Order Dispatched (more accurately the activity here might be "Order Dispatched via Delivery"):

Activity: "Order Dispatched"

Timestamp: delivery_dispatch_date for DLV-5001: 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z

Resource: the carrier name (GlobalTransport from carrier_id CR-01)

Attributes: carrier_id=CR-01? Or just the carrier name. Since it's a resource, showing GlobalTransport in resource column. Other attributes can include the delivery_note ("Normal route").

So row:

| 1001 | Order Dispatched | 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z | GlobalTransport | Delivery Note: "Normal route" |

5. "Order Arrived" activity for the delivery arrival: Timestamp arrival date 01/05/14:45.

Resource: GlobalTransport (same as dispatch)

Delivery note same.

| 1001 | Order Arrived | 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z | GlobalTransport | Delivery Note: "Normal route" |

Wait, but the carrier is the same as dispatch, so maybe not necessary to repeat. But the delivery note is an attribute. 

6. Invoice Issued: 

Activity: Invoice Issued

timestamp: invoice_issue_date 2024-01-06T09:00, resource Bishop Gina Carter (BL-001)

Attributes: invoice_id=INV-1001, amount: $250.00.

| 1001 | Invoice Issued | 2024-01-06T09:00:00 |Gina Carter | invoice_id: INV-1001; amount: 250.00 |

7. Payment Received: Jan10, method Credit Card (payment method and reference are attributes).

|1001 | Payment Received | 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z | (empty? No resource) | payment_method: Credit Card; payment_reference: REF-CC-123 |

But "Payment Received" event's resource? The payment table has payment references but no resouce id. Perhaps omit actor here.

Ok, proceed similarly for all orders.

Proceeding for other orders.

Order 1002:

- Order created by Bob Smith (SP-002) on Jan2.

Then two item_picks:

Item003, quantity4 by WH-002 (Eva) at Jan3 09:45,

Item005, quantity2 by WH-001 (David, 10:00).

Then two deliveries:

First DLV-5002:

Dispatch (April4th?)-- no, Jan4:

dispatched at Jan4/7:20, so trip one:

Activities: "Order Dispatched" on Jan 4th with note "Requires signature" via carrier FastShip (CR-02),

then arrival on Jan 7 at 16:10.

Then the second delivery DLV-5003:

Dispatched on Jan5/07:00 by CR-01 (Global), note "Partial backorder",

arrival Jan8 at 10:00.

Then invoices:

Two invoices:

INV-1002 issues on Jan8, by Harry Lee (BL-002),

INV-1003 on Jan10 (also BL-002).

Then payments:

INV-1002's on Jan12 (Wire Transfer),

INV-1003's on Jan15 (Check).

Thus:

First, the Order Created event for 1002:

Row:

|1002 | Order Created | 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z | Bob Smith | Customer:CUST-XYZ; Cust Type=Wholesale |

First item picked:

|1002 | Item Picked | 2024-01-03T09:45 | Eva Johnson (WH-002) | ITEM-003, qty4 |

Second Item picked:

WH-001 (David for ITEM-005):

|1002 | Item Picked | 10:00 | David Lin | ITEM-005,2 | 

Then first delivery's dispatch and arrival:

Dispatch (Jan4/07:20):

Resource = FastShip

|1002 | Order Dispatched | 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z | FastShip | note:Requires signature |

Then arrival at 2024-01-07T16:10:

Resource FastShip.

Same note.

Then second delivery's Dispatch (Jan5/7:00):

Activity: "Order Dispatched"

Carrier GlobalTransport (CR-01):

note:Partial backorder,

timestamp: Jan5/7:00,

resource: GlobalTransport

Arrival at 8/10:

Another row: Order Arrived on Jan8/10:00Z, same resource.

Then Invoice 1 and 2:

Invoice1 (INV-1002): Jan8,

Event: Invoice issued,

resource Harry Lee,

Attributes inv ID, amount $400,

Then invoice2 (INV-1003) on Jan10,

Event same, but $100.

Then, for payments: each invoce has a payment.

Payment1 for INV-1002:

Payment event: Payment received on Jan12 (Wire Transfer),

resource UNASSIGNED,

attributes payment_ref and payment method.

Similarly for the second invoice.

Proceed similarly.

I think I'm getting the idea. Now, the trick is to make sure each event is in order, and that the table includes all possible events for each case.

For order 1004 which does not have a delivery invoice or payment:

Their events:

Order created on Jan4 by SP-003 (Charlie Kim).

Item picked: ITEM-001 was picked on Jan6/8 AM by WH-002 (Eva Johnson).

No delivery, no invoice, so it ends at that point.

So the events are:

Order created,

Item picked,

And that's all.

Now, to construct the full event log, perhaps in chronological order within each order.

Now, the final table:

Start building:

Make the columns as such:

Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource/Actor | Other Attributes

Each row corresponding to one event.

Including the most relevant attributes.

Now, implementing this in markdown table structure, all these rows for each order.

Now, the total for the example data provided would be:

For 1001 (7 events):

- Order Created,

- 2 Item picks,

- 2 Delivery events (dispatch and arrived),

- Invoice and payment.

Total of 7 entries.

Order1002: Order Created (1) plus two item Picks (2) + 2 deliveries (each has two events, so 4 total delivery events), 2 invoices (2), 2 payments (2)  1+2+4+2+2=11 events.

Order1003: 1 created, 2 item picks, 2 (dispatch/arrived), 1 invoce, 1 pay  1+2+2+1+1=7 entries.

Order1004: 1 created, 1 item  2.

Order1005: created (1), 2 item picks, 2 delivery events, 1 invoice and payment  1+2+2+2=7. 

Total events: 7+11+7+2+7= 34 events?

Wait let's check:

Order1001:7, 1002:11, 1003:6 (1+2+2 items? Wait, order 1003:

- Created (1),

- two item pick events (on the 5th/15:30 and 15:45  2 events),

- delivery's 2 events (disapatch at 6/7:30, arrival at 7/20  2),

- invoice on 9/8,

- payment on 11/10:30  total 1+2+2+1+1=7.

So 1003 is 7.

Order1004: 2 events. 

1005:

- created,

- item_ pick for items 007 and 002 (2 items  2)  

- dispatched on 7th, arrived 9, (2 events),

- invoice on the 10th,

-payment on 15  1+2+2+1+1 = 7. 

Total sum is 7+11+7+2+7 = 34.

Now, to make the table, each row with the five columns.

Now, let me compile all events:

Start with case 1001:

Row 1: 

Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource | Other Attributes

1001 | "Order Created" | 2024-01-01T09:00:00 | Alice Brown | customer_id=CUST-ABC, customer_type=Retail |

1001 | "Item Picked" |2024-01-02T10:15 | David Lin | item_id: ITEM-001, quantity:2 |

1001 | "Item Picked" |2024-01-02T11:00 | Eva Johnson | item_id: ITEM-002, quantity:1 |

1001 |"Order Dispatched" | 2024-01-03T08:30 | GlobalTransport | delivery_note="Normal route" |

1001 | "Order Arrived" |2024-01-05T14:45 | GlobalTransport | delivery_note="Normal route" |

1001 | "Invoice Issued" |2024-01-06T09:00 | Gina Carter | invoice_id=INV-1001, amount=250.00, billing_person_id=BL-001 |

1001 | "Payment Received" | 2024-01-10T11:30 | (blank) | payment_method=Credit Card, payment_ref=REF-CC-123 |

Proceeding to 1002:

Order Created:

1002, Order Created, Jan2/12:30 | Bob Smith, with cust XYZ, type wholesale.

Then the item picked entries.

But before diving into all, I must ensure the other attributes are properly noted via key value pairs.

Now, in this table, the "Other Attributes" column can have entries like:

For the invoice entries, the invoice ID and amount. For payment, the method and reference.

The delivery note is good.

The item picked includes the item ID and quantity, along with maybe the picker? Not needed, since the picker is the resource.

Carry on for each.

Now, for delivery events, the resource is the carrier (GlobalTransport etc.), and the other attributes can include any notes.

Now, this is going to be a lengthy table. Since I have to present the final table here as the answer.

I need to structure it.

Each row's "Other attributes" can be a string with key-value entries, separated by semicolons or commas. For example:

For the Payment Received event for 1001:

Other Attributes: payment_method=Credit Card, payment_ref=REF-CC-123.

Alternatively, use a standardized format.

Proceeding to compile the final answer as a markdown table.

**Assumptions Made**:
1. **Missing Resources for Payments**: Payments do not have associated resources in the provided tables. Thus, only the payment method and reference are listed.
2. **Multiple Deliveries**: Orders with multiple delivery attempts (e.g., Order 1002) are split into unique “Dispatched” and “Arrived” events per shipment.
3. **Order 1004**: This order lacks delivery and payment records. Only the “Order Created” and “Item Picked” events are included.
4. **Resource Mapping**: Resource names and roles (e.g., "Alice Brown" from the `Resources` table) are used where possible. Carrier names are used instead of IDs for clarity.
