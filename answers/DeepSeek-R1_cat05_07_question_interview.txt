Here is a list of targeted, open-ended questions to deepen understanding of the property onboarding process:

### **Process Flow & Timing**  
1. How do you prioritize onboarding requests when multiple properties are submitted simultaneously? Are there service-level agreements (SLAs) for specific steps (e.g., document review, inspection scheduling)?  
2. What happens if a landlord cannot provide required documents (e.g., outdated certificates)? Are there alternative pathways to proceed, or is the process paused indefinitely?  

### **Roles & Responsibilities**  
3. How is the workload balance among property managers quantified (e.g., number of properties, tenant interactions)? Who oversees these assignments to ensure fairness?  
4. If a landlord disputes the assigned property manager’s approach, what escalation or reassignment mechanisms exist?  

### **Decision Criteria**  
5. How are trade-offs made when assigning a property manager (e.g., geographic specialization vs. workload)? Are there formal guidelines or scoring systems?  
6. How does the marketing team adjust pricing models when market trends shift unexpectedly after activation? Who approves deviations from the original strategy?  

### **Exception Handling**  
7. For properties requiring special insurance or custom lease clauses, who negotiates these terms (e.g., legal team, property manager)? How are such exceptions documented and tracked?  
8. If an inspector identifies major safety issues the landlord refuses to address, does the company terminate the onboarding process, or are there contingency plans?  

### **Stakeholder Coordination**  
9. How are third-party vendors (e.g., photographers, inspectors) selected? Are they vetted centrally or regionally?  
10. How do you ensure alignment between regional offices and support teams (e.g., IT, compliance) when onboarding properties with unique requirements?  

### **Quality & Compliance**  
11. What happens if a compliance officer identifies a regulatory violation *after* a tenant has signed the lease? How is this rectified?  
12. Are there feedback loops to update the onboarding process based on audit findings or recurring tenant/landlord complaints?  

### **Tenant Screening & Negotiation**  
13. How are conflicting tenant references or credit check results resolved? Is there a committee or escalation path for borderline cases?  
14. In competitive markets, how do you balance tenant prioritization (e.g., longer leases vs. higher offers) while adhering to fair housing laws?  

### **Communication & Documentation**  
15. How do you ensure critical communication (e.g., landlord requests, inspection outcomes) isn’t lost across email threads and CRMs? Are there reconciliation steps?  
16. What documentation is shared with landlords upfront to set expectations about timelines, responsibilities, and potential delays?  

### **Risk & Bottlenecks**  
17. Which steps in the process are most prone to delays, and how does the company mitigate these risks?  
18. How do external stakeholders (e.g., contractors, landlords) impact timelines, and are there penalties for repeated delays on their part?  

### **Post-Onboarding**  
19. Is there a handoff process between the onboarding team and long-term management teams to ensure continuity?  
20. How are tenant or landlord satisfaction metrics tracked after onboarding, and how do they influence future process improvements?  

These questions aim to uncover dependencies, decision-making frameworks, and resilience strategies within the process while avoiding technical implementation details.
