We are given a Windows activity system log. We need to transform it into a process mining event log.

 Steps:
 1. Case Identification: We need to group events into cases. A case represents a logical unit of user work. 
    Looking at the log, we see the user working on multiple documents and tasks. However, note that the user switches between applications and documents.

    Observation: 
    - The log starts with focusing on "Quarterly_Report.docx" but then switches to "Document1.docx" and starts typing. 
    - Then the user saves Document1, switches to Chrome to handle an email, then switches to a PDF, then to Excel for budget, then back to Document1, then closes Document1, and finally works on Quarterly_Report again.

    How to form cases?
    Option 1: Each document or task could be a case. But note that the user works on Document1, then interrupts it to do email, then comes back to Document1. This suggests that Document1 is a single case that spans multiple time intervals.

    However, note that the user also works on the Quarterly_Report at the beginning and at the end. But the initial focus on Quarterly_Report is very brief (only one event) and then the user switches to Document1. Then at the end, after closing Document1, the user reopens Quarterly_Report and works on it.

    Option 2: We might consider a case as a continuous work session? But the log spans about 8 minutes and the user is clearly working on multiple things.

    Let's try to see the flow:

    - The user starts by opening Quarterly_Report (but doesn't type) then switches to Document1 and types, saves, then switches to email, then to PDF, then to Excel, then back to Document1, then closes Document1, then reopens Quarterly_Report and works on it.

    It seems the user is working on a set of related tasks: editing two documents, handling an email, reviewing a PDF, updating a budget, and then going back to the documents.

    However, note that the user closes Document1 and then reopens Quarterly_Report. This might mark the end of one set of tasks and then starting a new one? But the two Word documents are independent? 

    Alternatively, we can consider the entire log as one case? But that might be too broad.

    Let me think about the user's goal: 
    - The user might be preparing a quarterly report which requires:
        a. Drafting a document (Document1) which includes an intro and later a reference to the budget.
        b. Handling an email about a meeting.
        c. Reviewing a PDF report and highlighting key findings.
        d. Updating a budget spreadsheet.
        e. Then going back to the Quarterly_Report to draft the executive summary.

    But note that the user started with Quarterly_Report, then switched to Document1. It's possible that Document1 is a draft for the Quarterly_Report? Or it might be a separate document.

    Given the ambiguity, we can form cases by the main document being worked on? However, the email and PDF and Excel are separate tasks.

    Another idea: The log might represent a single "project" of preparing for a meeting and a report? But we don't have clear boundaries.

    Considering the instructions: "A 'case' can represent a logical unit of user work, such as editing a specific document, handling a particular email, or reviewing a certain PDF."

    So we can have multiple cases in the log. We need to group events that belong to the same logical unit.

    How about:

    Case 1: Editing Document1.docx (from the first focus on it until the close event, but note there is an interruption for email and other tasks). However, the user leaves and comes back. So we cannot break the case? Or should we consider the entire Document1 editing session as one case even with interruptions? But the interruptions are for other tasks (email, PDF, Excel) which are separate cases.

    This suggests that the user is multitasking. Therefore, we should break the log into separate cases for each task.

    Proposed cases:

    - Case: Drafting Document1.docx
        Events: 
          FOCUS on Document1 (at 09:00:00)
          TYPING events in Document1 (09:00:30, 09:01:00)
          SAVE (09:01:15)
          Then the user switches away (09:01:45) -> this is the end of the first session? But then the user comes back at 09:06:00 and types again and saves and closes.

        However, note that the user returns to Document1 and adds more content. This is part of the same document. So the entire editing of Document1 should be one case? But the events are interleaved with other cases.

    We have to decide: do we want to have a case per task and then have the events in chronological order? The process mining tool can handle interleaved cases? Actually, in process mining, an event log is a list of events ordered by time, and each event is assigned to a case. So we can have multiple cases with events interleaved.

    So we can break the log into:

    Case 1: Document1 Editing
        Events: 
          - FOCUS on Document1 (09:00:00)
          - TYPING (09:00:30)
          - TYPING (09:01:00)
          - SAVE (09:01:15)
          - Then after the user returns:
          - FOCUS on Document1 (09:06:00) [Note: the switch event at 09:06:00 is from Excel to Word, so the next event is the focus? Actually the log has a SWITCH event and then a TYPING event. But note the log doesn't have a FOCUS event at 09:06:00? It has a SWITCH and then TYPING. We can consider the TYPING as the start of activity? But we need to assign the case to the document.

        However, note that the SWITCH event at 09:06:00 is from Excel to Word, and then the next event is TYPING in Word. So we can assign these to the Document1 case.

        But also note that the user closes Document1 at 09:07:00. So that should be the end.

    Case 2: Email Handling
        Events from the SWITCH to Chrome (09:01:45) until the send event (09:03:20). But note the events:
          - SWITCH (09:01:45) to Chrome Inbox
          - CLICK to open email (09:02:00)
          - SCROLL (09:02:30)
          - CLICK to reply (09:02:45)
          - TYPING (09:03:00)
          - CLICK to send (09:03:20)

    Case 3: PDF Review
        Events: 
          - SWITCH to Adobe Acrobat (09:04:00)
          - SCROLL (09:04:30)
          - HIGHLIGHT (09:04:45)

    Case 4: Budget Update
        Events:
          - FOCUS on Excel Budget (09:05:00)
          - TYPING (09:05:15)
          - TYPING (09:05:30)
          - SAVE (09:05:45)

    Case 5: Quarterly_Report Editing
        Events:
          - The initial FOCUS at 08:59:50 (but note that the user switched away immediately to Document1) -> but then at the end:
          - FOCUS at 09:07:15
          - TYPING (09:07:45)
          - SAVE (09:08:00)
          - CLOSE (09:08:15)

        However, the initial focus at 08:59:50 is on Quarterly_Report and then the user switches to Document1 without any typing? So maybe that was just opening? But then the user comes back at the end. We can consider the entire Quarterly_Report editing as one case? But note the initial focus is very brief and then the user leaves. Then at the end, the user returns and does substantial work.

        We have two options:
          a) Consider the initial focus as part of the Quarterly_Report case? But then the case would have two separate sessions? 
          b) Consider only the session at the end? But then we ignore the initial focus.

        However, the initial focus event is the first event. It might be that the user opened the document and then decided to work on Document1 first. Then at the end, the user comes back to Quarterly_Report. So we can have two cases for Quarterly_Report? But that doesn't make sense because it's the same document.

        Alternatively, we can have one case for Quarterly_Report that includes both the initial open (even though no typing) and the later editing? But then the case would have two separate periods of activity.

        In process mining, a case is a sequence of events. It can have gaps? Yes, but typically we want the events of a case to be in order and without interleaving of other cases? Actually, the events of a case are not necessarily contiguous in time? They can be interleaved? But in the event log, we list all events in time order and assign the case id. So the same case id can appear non-consecutively.

        So we can have:

          Case 5: Quarterly_Report Editing
            Events: 
              - FOCUS at 08:59:50 (even though no subsequent activity until the end)
              - Then at the end: FOCUS at 09:07:15, TYPING, SAVE, CLOSE.

        But note: the initial focus at 08:59:50 is on Quarterly_Report and then the user switches to Document1. We don't have any other event for Quarterly_Report until the end. So we can assign the initial focus to the Quarterly_Report case? But then the user didn't do any work? It might be that the user just opened it and then changed their mind? Or it might be a mistake.

        Alternatively, we can ignore the initial focus? But the log has it. We have to include it.

        How about we create a case for the initial focus? But then the case would have only one event? That's acceptable? But then the case would be "Opening Quarterly_Report" and then the user does nothing? That doesn't seem meaningful.

        Considering the instructions: "a case can represent a logical unit of user work". The initial focus might be part of the same case as the later editing? But the user didn't do any work at that time. So maybe we should only consider the later editing as the case? But then we lose the initial open.

        Another idea: We can have a case for each document that is opened? But then the case would be "Editing Quarterly_Report" and it would include the initial open and the later editing? But note that the initial open is very brief and then the user leaves. Then the user comes back and does work. So we can have:

          Case 5: Quarterly_Report Editing
            Events:
              - Open (we can map FOCUS to "Open Document" or "Start Editing")
              - Then later: Edit, Save, Close

        But note: the initial event is a FOCUS event, which we can interpret as "Start Editing" or "Open Document". And the later events are also for the same document.

        However, the user closed the document at the end? Yes.

        So we can assign:

          Case ID: Quarterly_Report_1
          Events:
            08:59:50: Start Editing (or Open) Quarterly_Report
            09:07:15: Start Editing (again) -> but note the log doesn't have an open event at 09:07:15, it has a FOCUS event. We can map FOCUS to "Focus on Document" or "Select Document". But we want to standardize.

        We need to map the raw actions to activity names.

 2. Activity Naming:

    We have raw actions: FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, SWITCH, CLICK, SCROLL, HIGHLIGHT, CLOSE.

    We want to map these to higher-level activities. For example:

    - FOCUS: This could be "Start Application" or "Focus on Document". But note the context: when it's on a document, it might be "Open Document" or "Switch to Document". However, we also have SWITCH events that indicate switching between applications.

    Let's break down:

    a) For a FOCUS event on a document (like Word or Excel):
        We can map to: "Edit [Document Name]" or "Open Document"? But note that the user might already have the document open and just switching focus? The log doesn't specify if it's opening or just focusing.

        However, the first time the user focuses on a document, it might be opening. But later, it might be switching back.

        We can standardize to: "Focus on [Document]" but that is low-level. Alternatively, we can have:

          - "Start Editing [Document]" for the first time? But then when the user comes back, it's "Resume Editing [Document]".

        But we want consistent activity names. We can have:

          - "Edit Document" for any FOCUS on a document? But then we lose the open event.

        Alternatively, we can have:

          - "Open Document" for the first FOCUS on a document that we haven't seen before? But we don't know if it's the first time.

        Given the complexity, and since we are creating an event log, we can have:

          Activity: "Start Editing" for any FOCUS on a document? But note that the user might not edit immediately.

        However, looking at the log: after a FOCUS on a document, often there is TYPING. So we can map FOCUS to "Start Editing Session" or simply "Edit Document". But we also have CLOSE events.

        We can have:

          - When the user focuses on a document: "Edit Document"
          - When the user closes a document: "Close Document"

        But note: the initial FOCUS on Quarterly_Report at 08:59:50 is followed by a SWITCH to Document1. So the user didn't type. So we cannot call it "Edit Document". It might be "View Document" or "Select Document".

        We need to be flexible.

    b) TYPING: This is clearly "Type Content". We can map to "Edit Content" or "Enter Text". But note that the keys are provided. We can ignore the keys for the activity name? We just need the activity name to be consistent.

        We can map to: "Edit Content"

    c) SAVE: This is "Save Document"

    d) SWITCH: This indicates switching from one application to another. We can map to: "Switch Application" but we lose the context. Alternatively, we can have:

          "Switch from [FromApp] to [ToApp]"

        But that would create many different activity names. We want standardization.

        Alternatively, we can ignore the SWITCH events? But they are in the log. They might be important for the process.

        However, note that the SWITCH events are not directly related to a case? They are transitions between cases? Actually, they are part of the user's work but not tied to a specific document. But we are creating cases per task. So we might not assign SWITCH events to any case? But then they would be orphans.

        Alternatively, we can assign the SWITCH events to the case of the application they are leaving? Or the destination? 

        Considering the instructions: each event should correspond to a meaningful activity in a process instance. The SWITCH event is not a task activity but a navigation. We might choose to ignore it? Or we can have an activity "Switch Application" and assign it to a case? But which case? It doesn't belong to a document.

        We can create a separate case for navigation? But that might not be meaningful.

        Alternatively, we can omit the SWITCH events? But the instructions say to include all events? Actually, the instructions say: "Each event in the final log should correspond to a meaningful activity in a process instance". So if we don't find a meaningful activity for SWITCH, we might skip it.

        However, note that the SWITCH event is important for the sequence. But in process mining, we are interested in the activities of the cases. The SWITCH events are not part of the task of editing a document, handling email, etc. They are just the user moving between tasks.

        Therefore, I propose to ignore SWITCH events? But wait, the log has them. We have to transform the log. We can map SWITCH to an activity "Switch Context" and assign it to a case? But which case? It doesn't belong to a specific case.

        Alternatively, we can have a special case for the entire session? But we decided against having one case for everything.

        Given the complexity, and since the SWITCH events are not directly related to the content of the cases, we can omit them? Or we can include them as part of the case that is being left? For example, when switching away from Document1, we can have an activity "Pause Editing" and then when switching back, "Resume Editing". But that would require interpreting the SWITCH as part of the editing case.

        How about:

          For a document case, when the user switches away, we record an activity "Suspend Editing", and when switching back, we record "Resume Editing". But note the log doesn't have a SWITCH event when switching back to the same document? Actually, we have a SWITCH event at 09:06:00 from Excel to Word, and then the user starts typing in Document1. So we can interpret that as resuming.

        But what about the SWITCH events that are between two different cases? For example, from Document1 to Chrome: we can assign the SWITCH event to the Document1 case as "Suspend Editing", and then the next case (Email) would start with the CLICK event? But then we lose the SWITCH event? We can record it in the Document1 case.

        Similarly, when switching to Chrome, we can record in the Email case the SWITCH event? Actually, the SWITCH event is the same event. We cannot assign it to two cases.

        Therefore, we have to choose one. Alternatively, we can have a separate activity for switching? But then we need a case for it? We don't have a natural case.

        Considering the above, I propose to ignore the SWITCH events for the event log? But note the instructions: we are to transform the raw log. We must include all events? Actually, the instructions don't say to include every raw event. They say: "Each event in the final log should correspond to a meaningful activity in a process instance". So if we don't find a meaningful activity for SWITCH, we skip it.

        However, let's see the other events: CLICK, SCROLL, HIGHLIGHT.

    e) CLICK: In the context of Chrome (email), we have two CLICK events: one for opening an email and one for replying. We can map to "Open Email" and "Start Reply". But we want standardized activity names. We can have:

          For email: 
            "Open Email"
            "Start Reply"
            "Send Email" (for the send click)

        But note: the send click is also a CLICK event. We can differentiate by the action attribute.

        Alternatively, we can have:

          Activity: "Click on [Action]" -> but that would create many activities.

        We want to abstract. We can have:

          - "Open Email" for the first click
          - "Reply to Email" for the reply click? But the action is "Reply to Email", so we can map to "Start Reply"
          - "Send Email" for the send click.

        But note: the log also has a CLICK event for sending. We can map that to "Send Email".

    f) SCROLL: This is "Scroll View"

    g) HIGHLIGHT: This is "Highlight Text"

    h) CLOSE: This is "Close Document"

    i) FOCUS: We have to map it. We can map to:

          - If it's the first time the document is focused, then "Open Document"
          - Otherwise, "Switch to Document"

        But we don't know if it's the first time. We can look at the log: 

          For Document1: the first event is a FOCUS. Then later, after switching back, we don't have a FOCUS event? Actually, we have a SWITCH event and then a TYPING event. So we don't have a FOCUS event when returning? The log has a FOCUS event only at the beginning of the log for Quarterly_Report and then at 09:00:00 for Document1 and then at 09:05:00 for Excel and at 09:07:15 for Quarterly_Report again.

        So we can map FOCUS to "Open Document" when it is the first event for that document? But then when the user returns to the same document, we don't have a FOCUS event? So we don't have an activity for returning? We only have the TYPING.

        Therefore, we can map FOCUS to "Focus on Document" and then when the user returns, we don't have a FOCUS event? So we cannot capture the return? We can rely on the TYPING event to indicate the resumption? But then we lose the exact moment of focus.

        Alternatively, we can ignore the FOCUS events when they are not followed by activity? But the initial FOCUS on Quarterly_Report is not followed by activity? So we can skip it? But then we lose that event.

        Considering the above, I propose:

          For FOCUS events on documents, we map to "Start Editing Session" if it is the first event for that document in the case? But note we are creating cases per document. So for each document case, the first event is a FOCUS? Then we can map that to "Start Editing". For subsequent returns, we don't have FOCUS events? So we don't need to map.

        But note: the log has a FOCUS event at 09:07:15 for Quarterly_Report, which is the second time the user focuses on that document? But we are creating one case for Quarterly_Report that includes both sessions. So the first event for the case is the initial FOCUS at 08:59:50 and then the next event is at 09:07:15 which is also a FOCUS? So we have two FOCUS events for the same case? That's acceptable.

        So we can map every FOCUS event to "Focus on Document". But that is low-level. We want higher-level. We can map to:

          "Edit Document"

        But then the user might not edit? In the initial Quarterly_Report, the user didn't edit. So we can have:

          "View Document" or "Select Document"

        But we don't know. We can use:

          "Focus on [Document]"

        But we want to abstract. Alternatively, we can have:

          "Open Document" for the first FOCUS in a case? But then the second FOCUS in the same case would be "Switch to Document"?

        This becomes messy.

    Given the complexity, I propose to map:

        FOCUS: "Start Editing"   (if the document is a document that is being edited, like Word, Excel) 
        But note the email is in Chrome, and we have FOCUS events? Actually, the log doesn't have a FOCUS event for Chrome? It has SWITCH and then CLICK. So FOCUS events are only for applications that are documents? The log shows FOCUS only for Word and Excel.

        So we can map FOCUS to "Edit Document" for Word and Excel? But then the initial focus on Quarterly_Report without any typing? We can still call it "Edit Document" even if no typing happened? It might be that the user intended to edit but then got interrupted.

        Similarly, for the return to Quarterly_Report, we map the FOCUS to "Edit Document".

        For the SWITCH events: we will skip them? Or we can map to "Switch Context" and assign to a case? But we don't have a case for context switching. So we skip.

    Let's decide on the activities:

        FOCUS -> "Edit Document"
        TYPING -> "Edit Content"
        SAVE -> "Save Document"
        CLICK -> We will differentiate by the action attribute:
                "Open Email" for the first click (action: Open Email about Annual Meeting)
                "Start Reply" for the reply click (action: Reply to Email)
                "Send Email" for the send click (action: Send Email)
        SCROLL -> "Scroll View"
        HIGHLIGHT -> "Highlight Text"
        CLOSE -> "Close Document"
        SWITCH -> We skip? Or we map to "Switch Application" and assign to a case? We skip for now.

    But note: the SWITCH events are in the log and we must transform them. We can create a case for the entire session? But we decided against. Alternatively, we can have a case for each application switch? But that is not a logical unit of work.

    Considering the instructions: "meaningful activity in a process instance", the SWITCH event is not meaningful for a document case. So we skip.

    However, the SWITCH event might be important for understanding the sequence of the user's work. But in the event log, we are going to have the events of different cases interleaved. The SWITCH event would be between events of different cases. So we can omit it? The process mining tool will see the events in time order and the SWITCH event is just a separator? But we are not capturing it.

    Alternatively, we can include the SWITCH event as an activity in the case that is being left? For example, when leaving Document1, we record an activity "Suspend Editing" in the Document1 case. Then when arriving at Chrome, we record an activity "Start Email Handling" in the Email case? But then we are using the SWITCH to mark the end of one case and the start of another? But note the SWITCH event is a single event. We cannot split it.

    We can have:

        For the leaving application: in the case of the leaving application, we record an activity "Suspend [Application]" at the time of SWITCH.
        For the arriving application: in the case of the arriving application, we record an activity "Start [Application]" at the time of SWITCH? But the SWITCH event has one timestamp. We cannot have two events at the same time? And we don't know the case for the arriving application until we start the next case.

        This is complex.

    Given the time, I propose to skip the SWITCH events. We will not include them in the event log. Similarly, we skip the SCROLL events? They are not critical? But the instructions say to include events that correspond to meaningful activities. SCROLL might be "Review Content". So we can include.

    So we will include:

        FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, CLICK, SCROLL, HIGHLIGHT, CLOSE.

    We skip SWITCH.

 3. Event Attributes:

    We need:
        Case ID: We will assign a unique case id for each case.

        Activity Name: as mapped above.

        Timestamp: the original timestamp.

    We may include additional attributes? We can include the document name or application? But the instructions don't require. We can include the application and document as attributes? It might be useful for analysis.

    Proposed additional attributes:

        - Application: the application name (e.g., Microsoft Word)
        - Document: the window title (which is the document name)

    But note: for the email case, the window title is "Email - Inbox", which is not a document. We can have a generic attribute "Context" or keep the window title.

    We can include:

        - Application
        - Window Title

    But note: the activity name already captures the action. The application and window title are context.

    We can include them as attributes.

 4. Coherent Narrative:

    We will create the event log with the following cases:

        Case 1: Document1 Editing
        Case 2: Email Handling
        Case 3: PDF Review
        Case 4: Budget Update
        Case 5: Quarterly_Report Editing

    We will skip the SWITCH events.

    Now, let's map each event to a case and an activity.

    Step-by-step transformation:

    Line 1: 
        Timestamp: 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z
        Action: FOCUS
        App: Microsoft Word

    Now, note that the initial event for Quarterly_Report (line1) is included in Case5, and then the events at the end (lines23-26) are also in Case5.

    We have two events for Quarterly_Report at the beginning and then a gap? But that's okay.

    We skipped the SWITCH events (lines 6, 12, 19).

    Now, we need to assign Case IDs. We can use:

        Case1: Document1 Editing -> Case ID: "Case_Document1"
        Case2: Email Handling -> Case ID: "Case_Email"
        Case3: PDF Review -> Case ID: "Case_PDF"
        Case4: Budget Update -> Case ID: "Case_Budget"
        Case5: Quarterly_Report Editing -> Case ID: "Case_QuarterlyReport"

    But note: the user might have multiple emails? In this log, only one email. Similarly, only one PDF and one budget. But the documents are unique by name? We can use the document name? But for email, we don't have a specific email subject? We used "Email Handling".

    Alternatively, we can generate unique IDs:

        Case1: "Case_1"
        Case2: "Case_2"
        ...

    But we want the case id to be meaningful? The instructions don't specify. We can use descriptive case ids.

    However, note that the same document might be edited multiple times? We have Document1 edited in two sessions. We assigned the same case id for both sessions. That's intended.

    We are ready to create the event log table.

    The event log table will have:

        Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Application, Window Title

    We don't have the keys for TYPING in the activity name? We can include the keys in an attribute? The instructions don't require. We can include as an attribute "Text" if present.

    But the instructions say: "include at least the following attributes: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp". We can include additional.

    We will include:

        Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Application, Window Title, and for TYPING events, we can include the "Keys" as an attribute "Text Input".

    Similarly, for CLICK events, we have an action attribute? We used it to name the activity. But we can also include it as an attribute? For example, for the "Open Email" activity, we can have an attribute "Email Subject" = "Annual Meeting"? But the log says "Open Email about Annual Meeting". We can extract? Or we can include the raw action.

    We can include the raw action as an attribute? But we want consistency. We can have:

        For CLICK events, we have an attribute "Action Detail"

    But to keep it simple, we will not include extra attributes beyond Application and Window Title? We can include the keys for TYPING? It might be useful.

    Proposed attributes:

        - Case ID
        - Activity Name
        - Timestamp
        - Application
        - Window Title
        - (Optional) Text Input: for TYPING events, the keys pressed.

    We can also include for HIGHLIGHT: the text highlighted? But we did not capture that in the activity name. We can have an attribute "Highlighted Text".

    But to be consistent, we will include:

        For TYPING: attribute "Text Input" = the keys string.
        For HIGHLIGHT: attribute "Highlighted Text" = the text (if available). In the log, it's "Key Findings".

    However, note the log for HIGHLIGHT has "Text=Key Findings". We can extract.

    But the instructions don't require. We can do without? Or we can include only if we think it's useful.

    Considering time, we will include:

        For TYPING: include the keys as "Text Input"
        For HIGHLIGHT: include the text as "Highlighted Text"
        For CLICK: include the action as "Click Action"

    But then we have many attributes. We can have a generic attribute "Details" that captures the extra information? But that is not structured.

    Alternatively, we can ignore? The activity name is already descriptive.

    We decide to include only the required attributes and Application and Window Title. We skip the extra details.

    Final event log table:

    We list all events in chronological order, with the Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Application, Window Title.

    We skip the SWITCH events.

    Let's write the table:

    Note: We have to list all events in time order.

    Ordered by timestamp:

    We skipped lines 6, 12, 19 (SWITCH).

    Now, we write the event log in a table format.

    We'll write it as a markdown table.

    Explanation:

        We grouped events into cases based on the document or task being performed. Each case corresponds to a logical unit of work: editing a specific document, handling an email, reviewing a PDF, updating a budget. 

        The case for Document1 Editing includes two separate editing sessions (with an interruption) because it is the same document. Similarly, the case for Quarterly_Report Editing includes an initial focus (with no subsequent activity) and a later editing session.

        We mapped raw actions to higher-level activity names to standardize the event log. For example, TYPING was mapped to "Edit Content", SAVE to "Save Document", etc. We differentiated CLICK events by their action attribute to create specific activities (e.g., "Open Email", "Start Reply", "Send Email").

        We included the application name and window title as attributes to provide context.

        We omitted SWITCH events because they represent transitions between tasks and do not correspond to a meaningful activity within a case.

    This event log tells a story of the user's work sessions: the user started by briefly looking at the Quarterly_Report, then drafted a document (Document1), then handled an email, reviewed a PDF, updated a budget, resumed drafting Document1, and finally completed the Quarterly_Report.

    The event log is suitable for process mining as it has a clear case structure and standardized activities.

### Explanation of Logic

#### Case Identification
Events were grouped into cases based on **logical units of user work**:
- **Document-Centric Cases**: Each document (e.g., `Document1.docx`, `Quarterly_Report.docx`) forms a case, capturing all edits, saves, and closures as part of a continuous document lifecycle. Interruptions (e.g., switching to email) do not split the case, as the user returned to the same document later.
- **Task-Specific Cases**: 
  - `Case_Email`: Events handling a single email (open, reply, send).
  - `Case_PDF`: Events reviewing one PDF (scroll, highlight).
  - `Case_Budget`: Events updating one spreadsheet (edit, save).

This approach ensures each case represents a coherent workflow (e.g., drafting a document from start to finish, handling an email end-to-end).

#### Activity Naming
Raw actions were mapped to standardized, analyst-friendly activity names:
- **FOCUS**  `Edit Document` (signals intent to work on a document).
- **TYPING**  `Edit Content` (generic for text input).
- **SAVE**  `Save Document`.
- **CLICK**  Context-specific names (`Open Email`, `Start Reply`, `Send Email`).
- **SCROLL**  `Scroll View`.
- **HIGHLIGHT**  `Highlight Text`.
- **CLOSE**  `Close Document`.
- **SWITCH** events were excluded as they represent navigation between tasks, not meaningful activities within a case.

#### Key Observations
- **Document Cases**: `Case_Document1` includes two editing sessions (interrupted by email/PDF/budget tasks) but remains one case due to continuity in document focus.
- **Temporal Context**: The log shows multitasking (e.g., email handled between document edits), but cases are interleaved chronologically for accurate sequence analysis.
- **Standardization**: Activity names abstract low-level actions (e.g., `TYPING`  `Edit Content`) to enable process pattern recognition.

This event log supports process mining by providing clear case boundaries, standardized activities, and contextual attributes (application/window title). Tools like ProM or Celonis can discover patterns such as "Document editing often interrupted by email handling" or "PDF review occurs before budget updates."
