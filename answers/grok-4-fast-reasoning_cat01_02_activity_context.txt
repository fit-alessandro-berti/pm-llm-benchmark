### Revised Event Log

Below is the revised event log with renamed activities. I focused on disambiguating recurring activities (primarily "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer") by incorporating contextual clues from their position in the sequence, timestamps, resources, and additional context descriptions. Non-recurring or consistently used activities (e.g., "Initiate Request," "Adjust Account," "Submit Additional," "Approve Request") were left unchanged, as they do not exhibit intra-case variation in meaning. The new names are descriptive, concise, and highlight the specific role or purpose in the process flow, making the log more interpretable without altering other columns.

### Justification of Naming Choices

1. **Verify Documents** (recurs in C001 and C003):
   - Renamed first occurrences to **Initial Document Verification**: This reflects the early-stage, standalone check of identity documents (e.g., after request initiation, before any issues arise). Clues: Position as the second event in each case, initial resource involvement (BackOfficeAgent or BranchOfficer), and context describing basic "checks" or "physical verification" without reference to prior fixes.
   - Renamed subsequent occurrences to **Document Re-Verification**: This captures the follow-up nature after an intervening action (e.g., document submission in C001 or account adjustment in C003). Clues: Later timestamp/position, explicit context like "re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided" or "re-verify docs after account adjustment," indicating dependency on prior resolution of incompleteness.

2. **Call Customer** (recurs in C002; appears once elsewhere but with varying purposes across cases):
   - Renamed in C001 to **Call for Missing Documents**: Purpose-driven by incomplete verification, leading to a request for uploads. Clues: Follows initial verification, context explicitly mentions "request missing docs," and leads directly to customer submission.
   - Renamed first in C002 to **Call to Clarify Discrepancy**: Focuses on outbound clarification of account issues. Clues: Mid-process after verification, context specifies "clarify account discrepancy," and precedes internal adjustment.
   - Renamed second in C002 to **Follow-up Call to Confirm**: Indicates a confirmatory role post-adjustment. Clues: Immediately after "Adjust Account," shorter interval from prior call, context describes "follow-up call to confirm adjustments."
   - Renamed in C003 to **Call to Return to Branch**: Branch-specific urgency for physical return. Clues: In-person context ("customer stepped out"), branch resource, and purpose of recalling the customer on-site rather than remote clarification.

These renames eliminate ambiguity by embedding process position and purpose (derived from additional context and sequence), improving traceability in the workflow. No changes were needed for single-occurrence activities, as their meanings are self-contained.
