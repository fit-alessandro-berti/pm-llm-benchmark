A process mining question!

After analyzing the provided event log and attributes, I've identified some attributes that could be sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute is sensitive because it indicates the borrower's citizenship status, which can be a protected characteristic in many countries.
2. **case:gender**: This attribute is sensitive because it reveals the borrower's gender, which is a protected characteristic in many countries.
3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute is sensitive because it indicates the borrower's language proficiency or cultural background, which can be a protected characteristic in some countries.

These attributes could potentially lead to unfair treatment or biases in the lending process. For example, if the lending process is more likely to reject applications or offer less favorable terms to non-citizens, certain genders, or those who don't speak German, it could be considered discriminatory.

It's essential to analyze these attributes in the context of the lending process to identify any potential biases or unfair treatment. By doing so, you can take steps to mitigate these issues and ensure that the lending process is fair and unbiased.
