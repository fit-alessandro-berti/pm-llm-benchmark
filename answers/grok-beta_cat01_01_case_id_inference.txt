To infer case groupings from the given sequence of hospital process events, we can use several attributes to help us identify which events likely belong to the same patient journey (case):

1. **Patient Age and Gender**: These are unique identifiers for each patient.
2. **Timestamp**: Events should generally follow a chronological order for each patient, although some activities might overlap due to parallel processes in a hospital setting.
3. **Department**: Events in the same department are likely part of the same case unless otherwise indicated by different patient details.
4. **Activity Sequence**: Certain activities logically follow others (e.g., registration precedes triage, which precedes consultation, etc.).

Here's how we can group these events:

### **Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER)**
- **ID**: Case1
- **Events**: 
  - Register patient (#1)
  - Initial triage (#4)
  - X-ray imaging (#7)
  - Doctor consultation (#12)
  - Patient discharged (#15)

### **Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER)**
- **ID**: Case2
- **Events**: 
  - Register patient (#2)
  - Initial triage (#5)
  - Lab test requested (#8)
  - Lab test completed (#10)
  - Doctor consultation (#11)
  - Prescription created (#14)
  - Patient discharged (#17)

### **Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Surgery)**
- **ID**: Case3
- **Events**: 
  - Register patient (#3)
  - Doctor consultation (#6)
  - Surgery preparation (#9)
  - Surgery performed (#13)
  - Recovery room (#16)
  - Patient discharged (#18)

### **Analysis:**

- **Case 1**: All events occur in the ER, with consistent patient details (age 45, male). The sequence follows a logical path from registration through triage, imaging, consultation, and discharge.

- **Case 2**: Similar to Case 1, but with different patient details (age 62, female). The events include lab tests, which are not seen in other cases, indicating a unique path through the ER.

- **Case 3**: This case is entirely in the Surgery department, following a surgical pathway from consultation to surgery, recovery, and then discharge with follow-up physiotherapy.

### **Conclusion:**

By grouping the events based on patient details, department, and logical sequence of activities, we've inferred three separate cases from the given data. Each case represents a distinct patient journey through the hospital processes. Here, we've used primarily patient age, gender, department, and the logical flow of hospital activities to determine case boundaries. Note that there could be exceptions or overlapping scenarios not captured here due to the complexity of real-world hospital workflows. However, this approach provides a structured way to group events into cases when explicit case IDs are not provided.
