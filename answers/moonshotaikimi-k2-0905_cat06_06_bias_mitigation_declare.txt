Explanation of the added fairness constraints
1. **Existence of BiasMitigationCheck & ManualReview** – guarantees that the two protective activities are always available in the event log.  
2. **Precedence (BiasMitigationCheck  Approve/Reject)** – enforces that every final decision is reached only after an explicit anti-bias validation step.  
3. **Non-succession** – blocks the dangerous direct sequence “reveal sensitive attribute  immediate decision”, removing the easiest path to discriminatory outcomes.  
4. **Coexistence of ManualReview with every decision** – ensures an independent second look whenever a potentially sensitive case is decided.  
5. **Alt-response from sensitive-check to BiasMitigationCheck** – makes sure that once any sensitive attribute is inspected, a mitigation check will eventually follow before the process may conclude.
