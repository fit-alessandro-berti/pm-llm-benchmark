The data appears to represent a workflow or approval process involving financial declarations submitted by an employee and reviewed/approved by various administrator levels, including:

1. **PRE_APPROVER**: A preliminary reviewer who checks if the declaration meets basic requirements.
2. **ADMINISTRATION/BUDGET OWNER**: A higher-level administrator responsible for reviewing and approving/batching submissions from PRE_APPROVERs or BUDGET OWNERS.
3. **SUPERVISOR**: An executive-level administrator authorized to make final approval decisions or reject/batch submissions.

The data shows the frequency (rate of new submissions) and performance metrics (average approvals/rejections per cycle) over a range of time periods, suggesting a tracking system monitoring workflow efficiency.

Here's a high-level breakdown of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration for payment.
2. PRE_APPROVER reviews and either:
	* Approves or rejects the submission.
3. If approved by PRE_APPROVER, the submission is further reviewed and approved/batched by BUDGET OWNER.
4. If not rejected by PRE_APPROVER, or if approved/BUSINESS OWNER, the submission proceeds to SUPERVISOR for final approval/rejection.

A decision can be:

* **REJECTED** at any level due to insufficient data, incomplete forms, or other issues.
* **APPROVED** by one of the reviewers and then **FINAL_APPROVED** by SUPERVISOR, resulting in payment processing.

The performance metrics appear to calculate the average cycle time (time between submission and final approval) for each frequency interval.
