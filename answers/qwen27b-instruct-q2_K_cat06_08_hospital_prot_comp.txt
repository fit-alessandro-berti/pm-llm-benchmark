The provided data appears to describe processes involving patient registration, evaluation stages including Expert Examination,Thorough Examination or examination at a facility (ER or FD), diagnosis determination steps followed by treatment administration until successful resolution or discharge.

Here are some key differences:

1. **Registration Points**: The registrations occur primarily through two points (`ER` Emergency Room and `FD` facility/Facilities). Their frequency varies significantly (`ER`: Frequencies range from once every `.00 performance units` up to `.32`, `FD`: Frequencies range from once every `.00` to `.26` performance units).

2. **Diagnostic and Treatment Stages**: 
   ```Register at ER```: Includes the most common process variation involving a step called `'Expert Examination'`, which often leads straight to Thorough Examination stage (`14.xx performance units`). This is followed by Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Success or Failure -> Discharge steps.
   
   ```Register at FD```: Involves examination points with Expert Examination or Thorough Examinations, but the diagnostic and treatment stages have a range of performance metrics differing from those in ER registration process (`14.xx`, `6.xx`, etc.).

3. **Discharge**: 
   - The successful discharge step varies significantly between different process variations (`0.00` up to `.38` performance units).
   
   - Successive unsuccessful-discharge attempts (after Treatment unsuccessful or similar steps) have a lower frequency compared with the successful ones (`16.xx`, `4.xx` vs.`8.xx`; for ER and FD respectively).

4. **Variability**: The process shows a range of success rates, which is reflected in performance units (`xx` refers likely to a time unit, specific value dependent on context). It indicates how efficiently each step is executed across different instances.

5. **Failure Path**: In some cases (`ER` and `FD`) instances fail treatment after an unsuccessful diagnosis or treatment stage (`16.xx`, `4.xx`). This leads further through failure-specific treatments like repeat examination or diagnosis followed by successful discharge (`3.xx`, `.xx`).

Each process has different stages, registration points (`ER`, `FD`) which might have different functionalities or resources available, diagnostic techniques applied (`Expert Examination`, `Thorough Examination`), and performance outcomes indicating efficiency within each stage.

Remembering the specific context in which these processes operate may be important for a complete understanding of their function but they are generic processes that could pertain various contexts like healthcare operations across hospitals, treatment plans across clinical stages etc
