**Introduction**

TechSolve Solutions is grappling with operational inefficiencies in its IT service desk, including increasing SLA breaches, frequent ticket reassignments, and misalignment between agent skills and ticket requirements. Utilizing a tiered support structure (L1, L2, L3) with agents possessing varied technical skills, the current resource assignment logic—primarily a mix of round-robin assignments within tiers and manual escalation decisions—is suspected to be a significant contributor to these challenges.

As a Process Improvement Consultant specializing in process mining for IT Service Management (ITSM), I will employ a data-driven approach to analyze and optimize TechSolve's resource assignment practices. Leveraging the event log data collected over the past year, I will provide actionable recommendations to enhance efficiency, improve SLA compliance, and better utilize agent skills.

### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

**a. Utilizing Event Log Data to Analyze Agent and Tier Performance**

To gain insights into the performance and behavior of individual agents and support tiers, I will extract and analyze key metrics from the event log data:

- **Workload Distribution**: Calculate the number of tickets handled by each agent and tier over time to identify workload imbalances.
- **Activity Processing Times**: Measure the time taken by each agent and tier to complete specific activities (e.g., "Work L1 Start" to "Work L1 End") to assess efficiency.
- **First-Call Resolution Rate (FCR) for L1**: Determine the percentage of tickets resolved by L1 agents without escalation to evaluate L1 effectiveness.
- **Skill Utilization**: Analyze the frequency with which agents handle tickets requiring their documented skills to assess skill alignment.
- **Ticket Type Handling**: Evaluate the distribution of ticket categories and priorities among agents and tiers to identify specialization areas.

**b. Applying Process Mining Techniques to Reveal Actual Assignment Patterns**

- **Resource Interaction Analysis**: Use process mining to map interactions between agents, highlighting handovers and collaborative patterns. This will reveal the actual flow of tickets between agents and tiers, identifying frequent paths of escalation or reassignment.
- **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**: Construct social networks based on handovers to visualize and quantify relationships between agents and teams. SNA metrics like degree centrality and betweenness centrality can identify key agents in the process flow.
- **Role Discovery**: Analyze activities performed by agents to infer roles and compare them with documented roles. This can uncover discrepancies between intended and actual duties.
- **Comparison with Intended Assignment Logic**: By mapping the actual assignment patterns against the intended logic (e.g., skill-based assignments, proper escalation protocols), we can identify deviations and inefficiencies in the current process.

**c. Analyzing Utilization of Specific Skills Across the Agent Pool**

- **Skill Matching Analysis**: Cross-reference the skills required for each ticket (e.g., "Required Skill") with the agent skills handling them to assess alignment.
- **Skill Utilization Metrics**: Calculate the percentage of time specialists spend on tasks matching their skills versus tasks below their specialization level.
- **Identification of Overqualified Assignments**: Highlight instances where highly skilled agents (L2/L3 specialists) are assigned to tickets that could be resolved by less specialized agents, indicating potential underutilization of skills.

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

**a. Pinpointing Specific Resource-Related Problems**

**Bottlenecks Due to Insufficient Availability of Agents with Specific Skills:**

- **Analysis**: Identify periods where tickets requiring specific skills experience delays due to a lack of available agents with those skills.
- **Quantification**: Measure the average wait time for tickets requiring scarce skills and correlate with SLA breaches.

**Delays from Frequent or Unnecessary Ticket Reassignments or Escalations:**

- **Analysis**: Count the number of reassignments per ticket and assess their impact on resolution time.
- **Quantification**: Calculate the average delay introduced per reassignment and its cumulative effect on ticket resolution.

**Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignments by L1 or Dispatchers:**

- **Analysis**: Identify tickets that were misclassified or incorrectly assigned initially, leading to escalations or rework.
- **Quantification**: Determine the percentage of tickets with incorrect initial assignments and their correlation with extended resolution times.

**Identification of Underperforming or Overloaded Agents/Teams:**

- **Analysis**: Use processing times and workload distribution to identify agents or teams consistently performing below benchmarks or handling excessive workloads.
- **Quantification**: Compare agent performance metrics to team averages to pinpoint underperformers or overburdened staff.

**Correlation Between Resource Assignment Patterns and SLA Breaches:**

- **Analysis**: Cross-reference tickets with SLA breaches against their assignment patterns to identify common issues (e.g., multiple reassignments, skill mismatches).
- **Quantification**: Determine the percentage of SLA breaches directly linked to identified resource issues.

**b. Quantifying the Impact of Issues**

- **Average Delay per Reassignment**: For example, if each reassignment adds an average of 2 hours to resolution time, and tickets with multiple reassignments breach SLAs at a higher rate, this quantifies the impact.
- **Percentage of SLA Breaches Linked to Skill Mismatch**: If 60% of breached tickets were initially assigned to agents without the required skills, the magnitude of the problem becomes evident.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

**a. Potential Root Causes**

**Deficiencies in Current Assignment Rules:**

- **Round-Robin Assignments Ignoring Skills/Workload**: The use of round-robin within tiers without considering agent skills leads to skill mismatches and inefficiencies.
  
**Inaccurate or Incomplete Agent Skill Profiles:**

- **Outdated Documentation**: If agent skills are not accurately documented or updated, assignments based on these profiles will be flawed.

**Poor Initial Ticket Categorization or Skill Requirement Identification:**

- **Inaccurate Ticket Information**: Incorrect categorization of tickets leads to misassignments and unnecessary escalations.

**Lack of Real-Time Visibility into Agent Workload and Availability:**

- **Invisible Queues**: Without real-time data on agent workloads, assignments cannot be optimized for efficiency.

**Insufficient Training or Empowerment of L1 Agents:**

- **Excessive Escalations**: L1 agents may escalate tickets unnecessarily due to lack of training or authority to resolve issues.

**b. Using Variant Analysis and Decision Mining**

**Variant Analysis:**

- **Comparing Smooth vs. Problematic Cases**: By analyzing process variants where tickets were resolved efficiently against those with multiple reassignments, we can identify factors leading to inefficiencies.
- **Identifying Patterns**: Common attributes in problematic cases (e.g., certain ticket categories, times of day, specific agents) can highlight root causes.

**Decision Mining:**

- **Extracting Decision Rules**: Analyze decision points (e.g., when agents decide to escalate) to uncover implicit rules or biases affecting assignments.
- **Identifying Inconsistent Decisions**: Highlight inconsistencies in assignment or escalation decisions that contribute to inefficiencies.
