### 1. Identification of Recurring Activities and Contextual Variations

#### Cases with Recurring Activities:

**Case C001**:
- **Verify Documents**: Appears twice.
  - First occurrence: Initial identity document check by BackOfficeAgent after customer submission.
  - Second occurrence: Re-check of documents after customer provides additional ID scan.
  
**Case C002**:
- **Call Customer**: Appears twice.
  - First occurrence: Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.
  - Second occurrence: Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made after the first call.

**Case C003**:
- **Verify Documents**: Appears twice.
  - First occurrence: Physical verification of ID by BranchOfficer at branch.
  - Second occurrence: Re-verification after account adjustment.
- **Call Customer**: Appears once (but in other cases, it's recurring; in C003, it's singular, but the pattern is similar in C001 and C002, so lessons apply).

### 2. Renaming Recurring Activities to Reflect Context

#### Renaming Strategy:
For each recurring activity, append a descriptor that captures its specific purpose or context within the case.

- **Verify Documents**:
  - Initial verification: "Verify Documents - Initial"
  - Subsequent verification after receiving additional info: "Verify Documents - Recheck"
  
- **Call Customer**:
  - Initial call to clarify or request information: "Call Customer - Clarification"
  - Follow-up call to confirm actions taken: "Call Customer - Confirmation"

#### Application to Cases:

**Case C001**:
- First "Verify Documents": "Verify Documents - Initial"
- Second "Verify Documents": "Verify Documents - Recheck"

**Case C002**:
- First "Call Customer": "Call Customer - Clarification"
- Second "Call Customer": "Call Customer - Confirmation"

**Case C003**:
- First "Verify Documents": "Verify Documents - Physical"
- Second "Verify Documents": "Verify Documents - PostAdjustment"
- "Call Customer": Only single call, but if it were recurring, similar logic would apply (e.g., "Call Customer - Return" for first, "Call Customer - Final" if more). Here, no rename needed.

### 4. Justification of Naming Choices

#### Verify Documents:
1. **Initial Verification**:
   - The first occurrence is when documents are first reviewed after submission. The "Initial" tag clarifies this is the starting point of the verification process.
   - Example: In C001, it's the first check; in C002 and C003, analogous initial checks.

2. **Recheck**:
   - In C001, after additional documents are submitted, the verification is repeated. "Recheck" indicates this is a subsequent verification after modification or (addition) of information.
   - In C003, the post-adjustment verification is a recheck due to changes in account details affecting the document validity.

3. **Physical**:
   - In C003, the first verification is in-person at a branch, distinct from electronic/documentary checks. "Physical" highlights this method.

#### Call Customer:
1. **Clarification**:
   - First calls (C001, C002) serve to clarify or gather additional information. "Clarification" captures this purpose.
   
2. **Confirmation**:
   - Subsequent calls (C002) confirm actions taken (e.g., adjustments). "Confirmation" distinguishes these from initial clarifying calls.

#### General Approach:
- The suffixes (Initial, Recheck, Physical, PostAdjustment, Clarification, Confirmation) directly relate to the **position in process** and the **context from Additional Context/Resource**.
- This ensures clarity on the *purpose* of each activity instance within a case, reducing ambiguity when the same activity name recurs with different intents.
