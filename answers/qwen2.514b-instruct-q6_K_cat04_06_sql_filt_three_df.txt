To achieve this task using DuckDB SQL, we'll need to create a query that follows these steps:

1. Identify sequences of activities in each case.
2. Check if the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' is present with the specified timing condition (more than 5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order').
3. Exclude cases meeting this criteria from the final result set.

Below is a SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
WITH filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
    FROM event_log e1
        JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
        JOIN event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e2.activity = 'Create Order' AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    WHERE 
        -- Ensuring the order of events
        e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp AND e2.timestamp < e3.timestamp
        AND 
        -- Checking if there's no activity between 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and 'Create Order', and between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'
        NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM event_log e4 WHERE e1.case_id = e4.case_id AND e1.timestamp < e4.timestamp AND e4.timestamp < e2.timestamp)
        AND 
        NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM event_log e5 WHERE e2.case_id = e5.case_id AND e2.timestamp < e5.timestamp AND e5.timestamp < e3.timestamp)
        AND
        -- Ensuring the timing condition between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp)) / 86400 > 5 * 86400 -- More than 5 days in seconds
),
filtered_events AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT fe.*
FROM filtered_events fe
LEFT JOIN filtered_cases fc ON fe.case_id = fc.case_id
WHERE fc.case_id IS NULL;
```

**Explanation:**

- **filtered_cases CTE:** This part of the query identifies `case_ids` that contain the exact sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' with no other activities between them, and where the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
- **filtered_events CTE:** This simply selects all events from `event_log`. It's just a temporary table to make the final selection cleaner.
- The main query then filters out those cases identified in the first part by joining with `filtered_cases` on case_id and selecting only where that join is null (meaning, cases not matching the criteria).

This way, we exclude all events from cases that meet both our sequence and timing conditions.
