I will break down my approach into five key sections, each addressing a critical aspect of optimizing scheduling at Precision Parts Inc. using process mining and advanced analytics.

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

**Process Mining Application:**

- **Job Flow Reconstruction:** We'll use process mining to sequence *all activities* associated with each job ID across the MES log, generating a visual representation of each job's path through the shop floor. This will identify frequently occurring task sequences (routing variants) and quantify their prevalence.
- **Timeline Construction:** We'll chronologically order events (starts, ends, queues) to compute precise time durations for each task, setup, and overall *job flow*.

**Specific Metrics & Techniques:**

*   **Job Flow Times:** Calculate actual lead time (Job Release -> Completion) from timestamps. Construct histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) across different product families. Compare with *planned lead times* if stored in logs.
*   **Queue Lengths & Wait Time Distributions:** Track time from *Queue Entry* event (by Resource) until task start. Aggregate by machine/work center to identify chronic bottlenecks.
*   **Resource Utilization:** Combine *Task End - Task Start* (productive time), *Queue Entry -> Setup Start* (idle), and *Setup Start -> End* (setup) to build utilization profiles. Compute percentage productive, idle, and setup time *per resource*.
*   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Analysis:** Create *job-pair fingerprints* (previous_job_id + current_job_id) for Setup Start events. Cross-reference with *Setup Duration* (Actual). Identify common combinations contributing most to overall setup time.
*   **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:** Compare task *Actual End* vs. Order Due Date for each job. Calculate the percentage of on-time deliveries, average tardiness, and distribution of delay magnitudes. Use *Case ID* linking to track deviation accumulation across multiple operations.
*   **Disruption Impact Analysis:** Identify Resource Breakdown events. Calculate subsequent task delays (as *Task Start - Planned Start Time*) and evaluate downstream machine utilization impacts. Compare periods before/after for variance analysis.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

**Key Performance Issues:**

*   **Resource Bottlenecks:** Utilization analysis (from Section 1) will pinpoint consistently overloaded machines. Compare their flow time contributions vs. utilization to quantify impact on throughput.
*   **Delayed Priority Jobs:** Cross-reference *Order Priority* from Job releases with actual completion times. Identify disproportionate delays for High/Urgent cases, possibly due to setup-heavy routings or last-minute scheduling interventions.
*   **Suboptimal Sequencing:** Analyze setup_pair fingerprints with high observed actual setup times relative to planned. Correlate with subsequent job flow delays.
*   **Downstream Starvation:** Look for patterns where resource utilization drops sharply after *upstream* bottlenecks, especially *between* common machine pairs (transfer points).
*   **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:** Aggregate queue length data over time for consecutive work centers. Identify amplification patterns where upstream variability (due to scheduling changes or delays) propagates downstream.

**Process Mining Evidence:**

*   Bottleneck analysis is done by applying a log filter for jobs routing through specific machines and comparing their processing times/setups against others.
*   Variant analysis for high-priority jobs uses case filters showing their routing deviations from standard sequences (e.g., forced into different machines).
*   Resource utilization analysis identifies ‘hot’ periods (high consecutive utilization of a machine) immediately preceding breakdowns, connecting them.
*   WIP analysis uses time series filtering of queue entries/exits with rolling averages to quantify variability trends by work center.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

**Underpinning Issues:**

*   **Static Dispatch Rules Failing in Dynamic Shops:** Process mining-derived data shows *daily* variability in machine availability, setup times, and task durations. These factors become unpredictable parameters for the current scheduling based on preset, unchanged rules.
*   **Lack of Real-Time Data Visibility:** Scheduling decisions (like dispatching) are shown with timestamp delays in log events. Compare timestamps when jobs enter queues vs. when scheduling decisions happened (visible in MES notes) - this gap indicates outdated information used during prioritization.
*   **Task Duration Estimation Limitations:** Compare process mining statistics for task duration actuals vs. what’s likely (but not explicitly stated) in MES data as ‘Planned Duration’. Investigate variance patterns by machine ID and shift timing.
*   **Sequence-dependent Setup Issues:** Process mining analysis identifies job pairs with unexpectedly long setup times, indicating potential machine sequencing flaws.
*   **Poor Cross-Resource Coordination:** Identify jobs with frequent queue entries (indicating ping-pong between machines). Correlate with frequent operator IDs and machine pairing data.

**Role of Process Mining in Differentiation:**

*   Compare bottleneck resources from Section 2 with overall resource capacity numbers (from ‘Resource’ event types). If capacity is sufficient but queues remain, this is a scheduling issue. If not, capacity expansion comes first.
*   Look for patterns where scheduling decisions (like prioritizing next job after setup) occur too late, as shown in MES timestamps. This shows that there is information latency.

### 4. Advanced Scheduling Strategies Development

**Strategy 1: Intelligent Dispatching Rules:**

*   Use dynamic selection based on *remaining_processing_time* (calculated from process mining task duration distributions), *due_date_proximity*, and *downstream_queue_length* (historically observed). Assign weights (alpha, beta, gamma) using logistic regression on process mining dataset:
   **priority\_score = alpha \* due\_proximity + beta \* remaining\_time + gamma \* downstream\_queue\_length**
*   Utilize historical setup data to calculate expected setup times (based on job-pair frequencies) to penalize certain sequence combinations.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling & Maintenance:**

*   Develop probabilistic distributions for task durations (from process mining task logs) with operators, machines, and shifts as conditions. Use Gaussian mixture models for multimodal distributions.
*   Integrative predictive maintenance alerts (if available) into task planning. For jobs needing machines with likelihood of breakdown (from historical patterns), preemptively swap routings if alternate paths exist.
*   Simulate preventive scheduling windows, such as running non-critical tasks during periods when bottlenecks are typically idle (using historical machine availability data).

**Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Job Clustering:**

*   Cluster jobs using *fingerprints* (material type, tool/fixture requirements): Apply clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical) to dimensions extracted from ‘Queue entry’ and ‘Setup start’ events.
*   Propose batching orders with similar setups via sequence clustering. Analyze cluster transitions to minimize setup-intensive moves (use process mining-derived transition metrics between setup-heavy processes).

**Implementation Impacts:**

*   Dynamic rules reduce setup delays for priority jobs, thus improving OTIF.
*   Predictive scheduling shows less variability in lead times, with better forecast abilities.
*   Setup optimization directly reduces flow times, particularly for bottleneck-sensitive jobs.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, Continuous Improvement Framework

**Simulation Environment:**

*   Build a discrete-event simulation model reflecting precise operation sequences (from process mining routing reconstruction).
*   Parameterize:
    * Resource breakdown rates from historical event data.
    * Task time distributions (including setup, actual, planned). Adjust min/max values from process mining statistics.
*   Simulation scenarios include:
    * Random vs targeted machine breakdowns.
    * Increased workload (from log filtering for high-load periods).
    * Different dispatching parameters (alpha, beta, gamma variations) for fine-tuning strategy 1.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   Measure strategy performance vs. baseline on KPIs:
    * OTIF (Order-to-Time-In-Full) percentages from all-on-time delivery rates.
    * Average and p95 lead time (from task end timestamp in simulated log).
    * Overall throughput (measured as jobs completed in specified time bins).

**Continuous Improvement Framework:**

*   Embed process mining dashboards:
    * KPI monitors for average queue length, utilization across shifts.
    * Setup time anomalies (compared to historical averages).
*   Alert triggers for strategy re-evaluation:
    * Thresholds for OTIF deviation (<15% baseline) from daily dashboards.
    * Auto-detection logic for shifts in resource breakdown profiles.
*   Automated strategy parameter optimization:
    * Monthly re-training of dispatching rule weights using latest 90-day event data.
    * Weekly updates for predictive maintenance models based on equipment sensor data trends.
