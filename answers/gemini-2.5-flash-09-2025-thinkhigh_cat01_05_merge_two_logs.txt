This integration process identifies matching events based on `order_id` and a time tolerance of 2 seconds. Where events cannot be matched due to semantic differences, timing discrepancies greater than 2 seconds, or absence in one log, they are retained as unique events.

## Integration Reasoning and Decisions

| Step | Log A Event (Timestamp, Type) | Log B Event (Timestamp, Name) | Decision | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | 10:00:00Z, Order Received | 09:59:58Z, OrderReceived | **MATCH & MERGE** | Time difference is 2 seconds. Event names are semantically identical. Used 09:59:58Z (Log B) as the primary chronological timestamp as it is the slightly earlier capture. |
| **2** | 10:01:30Z, Order Validated | 10:01:29Z, OrderValidation | **MATCH & MERGE** | Time difference is 1 second. Events are identical actions. |
| **3** | 10:02:00Z, Payment Processed | 10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck | **SEPARATE** | Time difference is 5 seconds, exceeding the 2-second tolerance. While conceptually related, treating them separately allows us to interpret 'Payment Processed' (A) as the external completion confirmation and 'PaymentCheck' (B) as the internal system verification, representing distinct points in the workflow. |
| **4** | N/A | 10:03:00Z, Quality Check | **UNIQUE B** | No corresponding activity in Log A. This represents an internal process captured only by System B. |
| **5** | 10:05:00Z, Item Shipped | 10:05:02Z, Shipping | **MATCH & MERGE** | Time difference is 2 seconds (at the limit). The event names ('Shipped' / 'Shipping') describe the same critical fulfillment milestone. |
| **6** | 10:20:00Z, Item Delivered | N/A | **UNIQUE A** | This is the final external status reported by System A (likely based on courier confirmation), which System B (internal warehouse) does not track. |

## Integrated Event Log

The integrated log uses the earliest available timestamp (`Event_Timestamp`) for chronological ordering, while retaining the original timestamps from both sources (`Timestamp_A` and `Timestamp_B`).
