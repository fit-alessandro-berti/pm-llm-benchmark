### Anomalies in the DECLARE Model

Here are the identified contradictions or undesired behaviors in the model:

1. **Contradictory Rules: "Noncoexistence" vs. "Existence of Closure"**
	- The constraint `noncoexistence["E"]["C"]` prohibits both evaluation (`E`) and closure (`C`) from coexisting in the same trace. However, the `existence["C"]` rule requires every trace to include closure. This contradiction undermines the logical flow and prevents valid traces from being accepted.
2. **Unenforced Sequence: "Evaluate" and "Approve" Missing Precedence**
	- The logical flow expects evaluation (`E`) to occur before approval (`P`). However, the model does not enforce this sequence, making it possible for claims to be approved without being evaluated, which deviates from the intended process.
3. **Response to "Assign" Activity Invalid: "Evaluate" Dependency**
	- The `responded_existence["E"]["A"]` constraint implies that evaluation (`E`) is a response to the assignment (`A`). This rule contradicts the `precedence["C"]["R"]`, which states that evaluation (`E`) or approval (`P`) should precede the receipt (`R`) of the claim.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Logic**
	- The rules were likely defined without a thorough understanding of the sequential relationships between activities. For example, the coexistence of `E` and `C` might have been overlooked despite closure requiring evaluation.
2. **Policy Updates Not Reflected**
	- Incremental changes in processing rules may not have been fully applied. For instance, new policies requiring evaluation before closure may have been inconsistently integrated.
3. **Data or Implementation Errors**
	- There may be flaws in how the model was generated. For example, mismatched constraints or misunderstandings from the domain model could have produced contradictory rules.
4. **Simplification for Operational Efficiency**
	- To reduce bottlenecks, the model may have been simplified by allowing certain steps to be skipped, such as permitting closure (`C`) without prior evaluation (`E`).

### SQL-Based Verification of Anomalies

1. **Find claims that were closed without evaluation:**sql

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'C'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM claim_events ev
      WHERE ev.claim_id = c.claim_id
        AND ev.activity = 'E'
  );
```
2. **Identify evaluation and closure activities coexisting in the same trace:**sql

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE e.activity IN ('E', 'C')
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e.activity) = 2;
```
3. **Find evaluation steps occurring without an assigned adjuster:**sql

```sql
SELECT e.claim_id, e.activity, e.timestamp
FROM claim_events e
LEFT JOIN claim_events a ON e.claim_id = a.claim_id AND a.activity = 'A'
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
  AND a.event_id IS NULL;
```
4. **Check for claims where the claim receipt and closure are logged before evaluation or approval:**sql

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM claim_events e
      WHERE e.claim_id = ce.claim_id
        AND e.activity IN ('E', 'P')
  );
```

By running these queries, you can validate if these anomalies occur in the actual data and confirm if the observed issues match the identified model constraints.
