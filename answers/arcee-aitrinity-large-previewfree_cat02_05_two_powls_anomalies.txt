Looking at the first model, the flow begins with posting the job ad, then screening candidates. From there, both the decision to hire and the interviews are available in parallel, which already feels off—typically, interviews happen before making the hiring decision, not alongside it. After the decision, the flow proceeds to onboarding, then payroll, and finally closing the case. While the structure allows for some flexibility, the fact that the hiring decision can be made without first conducting interviews is a clear break from the expected sequence. It's a deviation, but it still ends with all the necessary steps.

The second model starts similarly, with posting the job ad, but then allows interviews and screening to happen in parallel, which is again unusual. More problematically, the onboarding step is wrapped in a loop, and the payroll step is wrapped in an exclusive choice that can skip it entirely. This means onboarding could be repeated indefinitely, and payroll could be omitted altogether. Neither of those outcomes makes sense in a real-world hiring process—employees should be onboarded once, and payroll must be set up for them to be paid.

Between the two, the first model's issues are mostly about reordering steps that could still happen in a valid process, whereas the second model introduces structural problems that could prevent essential activities from occurring at all. That makes the first model closer to a normative process, despite its imperfections.
