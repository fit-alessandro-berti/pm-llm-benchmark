**Rationale:**
- **Coexistence Constraints**: By ensuring that a `ManualReview` activity coexists with any decision step related to sensitive attributes (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`), the model prevents biased outcomes by mandating an additional review layer for applicants from sensitive demographics. This ensures fairness and consistency in decision-making processes involving potentially biased data points.
  
- **Response/Precedence Constraints**: Introducing a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity after checking sensitive attributes (e.g., `ApplicantRace`) before making a decision step (`Reject`) helps to ensure that such decisions are not made hastily without proper consideration of fairness. This step acts as a buffer, reducing the risk of immediate biased outcomes following the initial attribute check.

- **Non-succession Constraints**: Preventing direct succession from sensitive attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace_Minority`) to decision events (`Reject`) directly guards against the immediate execution of decisions based on these attributes, thereby mitigating bias by ensuring a review or mitigation step intervenes before final outcomes are reached.

These additions aim to create a more equitable process model by enforcing checks and balances that reduce the likelihood of biased outcomes during loan application reviews.
