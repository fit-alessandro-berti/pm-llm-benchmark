### **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

To identify and characterize queues within the clinic’s patient flow, we leverage the event log data, which captures **start and complete timestamps** for each activity in a patient’s visit. These timestamps allow us to compute **waiting times** — the time a patient spends **waiting between the completion of one activity and the start of the next**.

#### **Definition of Waiting Time:**
In this context, **waiting time** is defined as the **time a patient spends idle between two consecutive activities**. For example, the waiting time between **Registration** and **Nurse Assessment** is the time from when the patient completes registration to when the nurse assessment activity begins.

#### **Key Metrics to Characterize Queues:**
To characterize the queues effectively, we calculate the following metrics for each activity pair (i.e., between two consecutive activities in a patient’s visit):

- **Average Waiting Time:** The mean waiting time across all patients for a given activity pair.
- **Median Waiting Time:** A more robust measure of central tendency, especially in the presence of outliers.
- **Maximum Waiting Time:** Identifies the worst-case scenario for a given activity pair.
- **90th Percentile Waiting Time:** Helps identify the waiting time that 90% of patients experience or below, indicating the typical "long" wait.
- **Queue Frequency:** The number of patients who experienced a wait between two activities.
- **Number of Cases with Excessive Waits:** Patients whose waiting time exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 30 minutes), indicating potential dissatisfaction or operational inefficiency.

#### **Identifying the Most Critical Queues:**
To prioritize which queues require immediate attention, we can use a **weighted scoring system** based on the following criteria:

- **Queue Duration (Average/Median Wait):** Queues with higher average or median waiting times are more critical.
- **Impact on Patient Experience:** Queues with high 90th percentile waiting times are more likely to cause dissatisfaction.
- **Frequency of Occurrence:** Frequent waits indicate a systemic issue.
- **Impact on Patient Type/Urgency:** Queues that disproportionately affect urgent or new patients may be prioritized.
- **Resource Utilization:** Queues that occur due to underutilized or overburdened resources (e.g., a nurse who is consistently busy) may be prioritized for optimization.

By combining these factors, we can identify the most critical queues that, if addressed, would have the greatest impact on patient satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis**

Beyond identifying where the queues occur, it is essential to understand **why** these queues happen. Process mining techniques can help uncover the **root causes** behind these bottlenecks.

#### **Potential Root Causes:**

- **Resource Bottlenecks:**
  - **Staff Shortages or Overload:** If a nurse is consistently the next activity after registration, but their average waiting time is high, it may indicate a staffing shortage or inefficient scheduling.
  - **Room or Equipment Underutilization:** If ECG tests take too long due to a single technician or room being the bottleneck, this could be a resource constraint.

- **Activity Dependencies and Handovers:**
  - If a patient must wait for a nurse to complete the previous task before moving on, this could indicate poor handover or lack of parallel processing.

- **Variability in Service Times:**
  - High variability in the time it takes to complete an activity (e.g., doctor consultations) can lead to unpredictable waiting times downstream.

- **Appointment Scheduling Policies:**
  - If the clinic schedules too many patients at the same time for a particular activity, it can lead to long queues. For example, if all new patients are scheduled for nurse assessment at the same time, the nurse may be overwhelmed.

- **Patient Arrival Patterns:**
  - If patients arrive in waves or at specific times, it can create congestion in the queue for the first activity (registration).

- **Differences Based on Patient Type or Urgency:**
  - Urgent patients may be scheduled differently, but if they still face long waits due to a bottleneck in the system, it indicates a flaw in the prioritization logic.

#### **Process Mining Techniques to Uncover Root Causes:**

- **Resource Analysis:** Identify which resources (staff, rooms) are most frequently involved in queues. High utilization or long waiting times for a specific resource may indicate a bottleneck.
- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Using process mining tools like **CIM (Conformance Checking and Mining)** or **Discovered Process Models**, we can identify the activities that most frequently cause delays.
- **Variant Analysis:** Analyze different process variants to see if certain patient types or conditions (e.g., new vs. follow-up) follow different paths, leading to different waiting times.
- **Time Analysis:** Calculate the **cycle time** (total time from registration to check-out) and **waiting time** between activities to identify where the most time is lost.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Correlate waiting times with resource utilization, patient type, and urgency to uncover patterns and drivers of delays.

### **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Demand Forecasting**

**Target Queue:** Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation  
**Root Cause:** Nurse assessments are frequently delayed due to high patient volume or nurse unavailability, causing long waits before consultations.

**Implementation:**
- Use historical event log data to **forecast patient arrival patterns** and **predict nurse workload**.
- Implement a **dynamic scheduling system** that assigns nurses based on predicted demand and availability.
- Introduce **shift-based resource allocation** or **floating staff** to cover peak times.

**Supporting Data:**
- Historical data shows that nurse assessments take an average of 15 minutes but are delayed by 15–20 minutes due to high patient load.
- Using **predictive analytics**, we can allocate 2 additional nurses during peak hours, reducing the average wait between nurse assessment and doctor consultation by 40%.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduction in average wait time between nurse assessment and doctor consultation:** 40%.
- **Improved patient satisfaction** due to shorter waits for consultations.

---

#### **Strategy 2: Parallelization of Diagnostic Tests with Doctor Consultations**

**Target Queue:** Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test (e.g., ECG)  
**Root Cause:** Diagnostic tests are often scheduled sequentially after the consultation, leading to long waiting times for patients.

**Implementation:**
- Allow **parallel processing** by scheduling diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG) **during or before** the doctor consultation, where possible.
- Use **electronic health records (EHR)** to pre-order tests based on initial assessment, reducing the need for waiting.

**Supporting Data:**
- ECG tests take an average of 8 minutes, but the wait between consultation and test is 12 minutes.
- By allowing parallel processing, the **wait time between consultation and ECG** can be reduced to near zero.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduction in average wait time between doctor consultation and ECG:** 80%.
- **Shorter overall visit duration** and **higher patient throughput**.

---

#### **Strategy 3: Prioritization of Urgent Patients Using a Triage-Based Scheduling System**

**Target Queue:** Registration  Nurse Assessment  
**Root Cause:** Urgent patients may be delayed due to lack of prioritization in the system, leading to longer waits.

**Implementation:**
- Implement a **triage-based scheduling system** that assigns urgent patients to **dedicated lanes** or **earlier time slots**.
- Use **automated triage tags** in the EHR to flag urgent patients and route them to **priority queues** in the event log.

**Supporting Data:**
- Urgent patients currently wait an average of 25 minutes after registration, compared to 10 minutes for new patients.
- A triage-based system could reduce this to **12 minutes**, aligning with the wait time of new patients.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduction in average wait time for urgent patients:** 52%.
- **Improved patient satisfaction** for urgent care patients and better alignment with triage principles.

### **4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

While the proposed strategies offer clear benefits, they also come with potential trade-offs:

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** May increase **staff workload** or **operational costs** if additional nurses are required. This must be balanced with the cost of **patient dissatisfaction** or **lost business** due to long waits.
- **Parallelization of Diagnostic Tests:** Requires **additional infrastructure** (e.g., more equipment, trained staff) and **coordination with physicians** to ensure tests are ordered correctly and in a timely manner.
- **Triage-Based Scheduling:** Could lead to **increased wait times for non-urgent patients** if urgent patients are prioritized too heavily. This must be managed carefully to avoid **disproportionate delays** for follow-up or new patients.

To balance these trade-offs, we would:
- Use **cost-benefit analysis** to compare the cost of additional resources (e.g., nurses, equipment) against the **revenue and satisfaction gains**.
- Implement **feedback loops** from staff and patients to continuously refine the system.
- Use **A/B testing** or **pilot programs** before full-scale implementation to assess the impact of changes.

### **5. Measuring Success**

To measure the effectiveness of the implemented optimization strategies, we define the following **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

- **Average Waiting Time Between Activities:** For critical queues (e.g., registration to nurse assessment, nurse assessment to doctor consultation).
- **90th Percentile Waiting Time:** To ensure that 90% of patients experience acceptable wait times.
- **Overall Visit Duration:** From registration to check-out.
- **Patient Satisfaction Score:** Measured through post-visit surveys.
- **Resource Utilization Rate:** For staff and equipment, to ensure efficiency is not compromised.
- **Number of Cases with Excessive Waits:** To track the impact on patient dissatisfaction.

#### **Ongoing Process Monitoring:**

- **Automated Dashboards:** Use real-time or near-real-time dashboards to monitor KPIs and detect any regression in performance.
- **Event Log Analysis:** Continuously analyze new event logs to identify any **new bottlenecks** or **unintended consequences** of the optimization strategies.
- **Feedback Loops:** Collect feedback from patients and staff to refine the process further.
- **Periodic Re-Analysis:** Conduct quarterly or bi-annual process mining analyses to ensure that the system remains optimized as patient volume, staff, and processes evolve.

By combining these KPIs and monitoring strategies, the clinic can ensure **sustained improvement** in patient flow, satisfaction, and operational efficiency.
