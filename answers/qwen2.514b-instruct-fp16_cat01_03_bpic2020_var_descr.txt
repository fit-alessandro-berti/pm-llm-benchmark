The provided data appears to outline various sequences of events or workflows related to declaration management in what seems like a reimbursement, expense claim, or similar financial processing system. Here's a breakdown of one typical workflow and then an explanation based on the examples given:

1. **Submission Phase**: A declaration is initially submitted by an employee.
2. **Approval Phase**:
   - The submission can be reviewed (and potentially approved) in various steps:
     - By an Administration or PRE_APPROVER role
     - Sometimes also reviewed and approved by a BUDGET OWNER.
3. **Supervisor/Final Approval**: 
   - Declaration is then typically evaluated for final approval by a SUPERVISOR. If the declaration fails this step, it can either be rejected directly (leading to further employee actions) or might have some specific reasons attached like "MISSING" documentation.
4. **Rejection Handling**:
   - Rejected declarations may undergo multiple iterations, with employees resubmitting their forms after making necessary corrections or adjustments.
5. **Payment Phase**: 
   - Once a declaration is finally approved (after going through all necessary checks and potentially being rejected and corrected), it enters the payment processing phase where it's requested and handled for financial action.

### Example Process Descriptions:
- **Successful Workflow:**
  - Declaration goes from EMPLOYEE to ADMINISTRATION, then BUDGET OWNER approval.
  - Finally SUPERVISOR approves, leading to a request for payment which is subsequently handled (Final Outcome).

- **Failed Workflows**:
  - Some paths lead back to the employee due to rejection at various stages like PRE_APPROVER or ADMINISTRATION.
    - These could involve multiple rounds of edits and resubmissions.

### Performance Metrics:
The `performance` seems to denote a measure related to time taken or efficiency for each workflow completion. This is likely tied to how many actions or iterations are needed before reaching the final state, with higher values indicating longer or more complex paths.
  
- **High performance** indicates fewer steps or quicker approval processes (e.g., straight through from employee to supervisor).
- **Lower performance** reflects workflows with many rejections and resubmissions.

In summary, this data describes a process where declarations move through an approval workflow involving multiple stages of review. Employees may need to correct their submissions if they are not initially approved by the appropriate roles. Once approved, the declaration moves forward for payment handling. The effectiveness and efficiency of each path can be analyzed based on performance metrics provided.

For specific workflows in your list:
- **High-Frequency Paths**: More common processes where fewer iterations between employees and approvers typically lead to smoother operations.
- **Lower Frequency but High Performance Workflows**: These may highlight ideal scenarios with efficient approval structures or minimal required rework from initial submission.
