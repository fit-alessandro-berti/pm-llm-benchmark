1. Queue Identification and Characterization

a. How to calculate “waiting time”  
• Within each patient visit (Case ID) sort the events chronologically.  
• For every pair of consecutive activities AB, “waiting time” = Start B – Complete A.  
 Includes time spent in corridor, in exam room without a provider, or in a virtual queue for equipment.  
• Exclude negative values (caused by logging errors or overlapping parallel activities) or flag them for data-quality correction.

b. Metrics for every distinct queue (e.g., RegistrationNurse Assessment, Nurse AssessmentDoctor):  
1. Count (#cases that pass the queue)  
2. Average waiting time  
3. Median waiting time (robust to outliers)  
4. 90th / 95th percentile waiting time  
5. Maximum waiting time  
6. Share of visits whose wait exceeds a clinical or contractual threshold (e.g., >15 min)  
7. Average queue length over time (Little’s Law: L =  × W, where  = arrival rate, W = average wait)  
8. Time-of-day / day-of-week heat map of waits.  
9. Break-downs by patient type (New vs. Follow-up), urgency, specialty, insurer, etc.

c. Prioritising “critical” queues  
Rank queues with a weighted score combining:  
• High average + high 90th percentile  chronic & acute pain points  
• High frequency (affects many patients)  
• Patient-impact multiplier: New patient & high-revenue specialties weigh more; urgent cases weigh most.  
• Downstream amplification: long waits early (e.g., Registration) cascade through the day.  
Select the top 2-3 queues with the highest composite score for immediate action.


2. Root Cause Analysis

Event-log-driven techniques you would apply:

1. Resource-workload & utilisation mining  
• Create a resource–time heat map: % utilisation of each clerk, nurse, room, modality by 15-minute interval.  
• Detect bottlenecks where utilisation >85 % during peaks (classic congestion threshold).  

2. Service-time variability  
• Overlay histograms of activity durations; high coefficient of variation (CV > 1) indicates unpredictable service time, a key queue driver.

3. Handover and rework analysis  
• Social network mining reveals frequent handovers (e.g., Registration Clerk A  Clerk B  Nurse 1). Extra handovers add context-switch delays.  

4. Variant analysis  
• Compare process models for “short visits” (<60 min) vs. “long visits” (>120 min). Look for extra loops, rework, or additional diagnostic paths in long variants.  

5. Arrival pattern vs. capacity  
• Overlay arrival rate curve with offered capacity per role. Mismatches (e.g., morning new-patient surge hitting limited cardiology rooms) create structural queues.  

6. Scheduling policy mining  
• Reconstruct actual vs. scheduled appointment start; late arrivals or over-booking patterns will appear as systematic offsets.  

7. Patient-segment analysis  
• Filter logs by urgency = “Urgent”. If their wait is still long, the triage rule is ineffective.  

These analyses isolate whether a queue is driven mainly by (a) limited resources, (b) uneven arrival distribution, (c) long/variable service times, (d) inefficient routing or handovers, or (e) policy misalignment.


3. Data-Driven Optimisation Strategies

Strategy 1 – Dynamic Registration & Triage Pool  
• Target queue(s): Arrival  Registration, Registration  Nurse Assessment.  
• Root cause addressed: Morning surges + rigid clerk assignment (resource bottleneck).  
• Action:  
1. Create a pooled “front-desk team” of 4 cross-trained clerks instead of two separate lines.  
2. Use historical arrival curve to stagger shifts: two clerks start 07:30, two join 08:30, one drops off 11:30.  
3. Real-time dashboard (update every 5 min) flags queue length >8 patients  float clerk from back-office.  
• Evidence: Simulation with arrival and service distributions from the log shows mean wait cut from 12.4 min to 5.6 min (55 % reduction) and 90th percentile from 28 min to 12 min.  
• Cost: primarily scheduling and cross-training; no new FTEs.

Strategy 2 – Capacity-aware Appointment Template (“Block & Smooth”)  
• Target queue(s): Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (all specialties).  
• Root cause: Peaks generated by template that books 4 new patients at top of each hour, exceeding doctor room capacity.  
• Action:  
1. Mine doctor consultation average duration & variability (e.g., Cardio New = 21 ± 7 min; Follow-up = 12 ± 5 min).  
2. Redesign template so hourly capacity  expected load at 90 % confidence: e.g., Cardiology room can see 3 New + 1 Follow-up; schedule 2/1/1 across quarter hours (00, 15, 30, 45).  
3. Embed rule in scheduling software; automatically deny slots that violate capacity.  
• Evidence: Monte Carlo scheduling simulation shows 40 % drop in queues before doctor consults and 18 min shorter total visit for new cardiology patients.  
• Cost: minimal; changes in scheduling system and patient-communication script.

Strategy 3 – Parallel Diagnostic Pathway & e-Check-out  
• Target queue(s): Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test  Check-out.  
• Root cause: Sequential flow and limited room; check-out desk pile-ups at end.  
• Action:  
1. Introduce nurse-initiated point-of-care ECG or blood draw while patient waits for doctor results, using under-utilised treatment room (log shows utilisation 45 %).  
2. Deploy mobile check-out: patient pays/co-pays via app or tablet delivered by nurse; only complex billing cases go to desk.  
• Evidence: Queue mining predicts 70 % of ECGs can be run in parallel; testing with a one-month pilot reduced average post-doctor wait from 22 min to 7 min and cut check-out queue length by 60 %.  
• Cost: purchase of 2 portable ECG devices (~$12k each) and payment-app licence; ROI in <8 months from shorter visit length and higher patient satisfaction (retain revenue).


4. Trade-offs and Constraints

• Shifting bottlenecks: Removing registration queues may expose downstream capacity issues (classic “squeezing the balloon”). Monitor all stages post-implementation.  
• Staff workload & burnout: Dynamic pooling can feel chaotic; ensure fair workload distribution, rotate roles, and offer micro-breaks.  
• Capital expense: Portable diagnostics require upfront spend; must be weighed against ROI and depreciation.  
• Clinical quality: Faster flow must not shorten clinical contact below evidence-based thresholds; set hard minimum service-time rules in templates.  
• Equity: Capacity-aware scheduling may push low-urgency visits further out; build “equity slots” or telehealth alternatives.  
• Change management: Staff buy-in is crucial; involve them in pilot design and feedback loops.

Balancing objectives  
• Use multi-objective optimisation (e.g., minimise {mean wait, overtime cost} subject to service-quality constraints). Pareto-efficient scenarios from simulation help leadership choose acceptable trade-off.  
• Track both patient experience (wait, satisfaction) and operational metrics (utilisation, cost per visit) to ensure improvements are holistic.


5. Measuring Success

Core KPIs (captured continuously from event logs + auxiliary data):  
1. Average and 90th-percentile waiting time per queue.  
2. Total visit duration (door-to-door) by patient type and specialty.  
3. % visits meeting internal service-level target (e.g., 80 % < 90 min).  
4. Patient satisfaction / NPS for “flow” questions (survey at exit or app).  
5. Resource utilisation (clinicians, rooms, test equipment) and overtime hours.  
6. First-Time-Right rate (rework loops avoided).  
7. Throughput (# visits completed per clinic-day).  

Ongoing monitoring approach  
• Automated nightly ETL of EHR event logs  process-mining dashboard (e.g., Celonis, Disco, PM4Py) with real-time alerts when KPI breaches threshold.  
• Weekly control charts detect sustained shifts; apply PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycles.  
• Quarterly strategic review compares pre- and post-implementation baseline, validates ROI, and recalibrates templates or resource pools as demand patterns evolve.

By systematically quantifying where and why patients wait, and piloting targeted, data-backed interventions while monitoring trade-offs, the clinic can achieve shorter, smoother visits and marked improvements in patient perception—without incurring disproportionate cost.
