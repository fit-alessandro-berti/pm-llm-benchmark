### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**  
**Key Metrics & Analysis:**  
- **Workload Distribution:** Calculate the *volume of tickets per agent/tier* and *time spent per activity* (e.g., L1 resolution time vs. L2 escalation handle time). Use **resource-gantt charts** to visualize overloads (e.g., Agent B12 in the log handles 60% of Database-SQL tickets, creating a bottleneck).  
- **Skill Utilization:** Build a *heatmap* of skills vs. ticket requirements. For example, if 70% of Network-Firewall tickets require L2, but L1 agents are handling 40% due to skill gaps, this creates inefficiency.  
- **Resolution Outcomes:** Track *First Call Resolution (FCR) rates* for L1 and *escalation success rates* for L2/L3. Low FCR indicates skill mismatches; high escalation retries suggest poor initial routing.  

**Process Mining Techniques:**  
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Map handovers (e.g., `Reassign` activities in the log) to identify frequent escalation paths (e.g., 40% of P2 Network tickets cycle between Agent A02 (L1) and B08 (L2) due to missing firewall skills in L1).  
- **Role Discovery:** Classify agents into "specialized" (e.g., Agent B15 excels in Database-SQL) vs. "generalists" (Agent A05 handles only Basic-Troubleshoot). Highlight underutilized experts (e.g., Agent C03’s Security-IAM skills are only used 10% of the time).  
- **Process Conformance:** Compare actual vs. intended workflows. For instance, if the ideal path is "L1  Escalate to L2 once," but 25% of tickets undergo 2 escalations due to misrouting, this reveals rule-breaking (e.g., L2 agents with mismatched skills).  

**Comparison to Intended Logic:**  
- The current round-robin assignment ignores *skill availability* (e.g., L1 agents without App-CRM skills are still assigned CRM tickets, leading to 35% faster escalations). Process mining exposes this via *fitness scores* in conformance checking (e.g., a score of 0.6 indicates significant deviation from rules).

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**  
**Bottleneck Detection:**  
- **Skill Gaps:** 60% of P3 Software-App tickets require App-CRM, but only 20% of L1 agents possess this skill. Process mining identifies this via *frequency distribution* of `Required Skill` vs. `Agent Skills`.  
- **Reassignment Delays:** Calculate the average delay per reassignment (e.g., 45 minutes for P2 Network tickets). Link this to SLA breaches: a P2 ticket exceeding 1.5 hours has a 40% chance of SLA breach.  
- **Inefficient Escalations:** Analyze decision points where L1 agents escalate tickets lacking specialized skills (e.g., 80% of escalations from Agent A05 involve "missing skill" as a note).  

**Quantified Impact:**  
- **Skill Mismatch:** 30% of L2 resolution time is spent reworking L1 errors due to incorrect initial assignments.  
- **Overloaded Agents:** Tools like **DMN simulation** show Agent B12’s workload spikes to 1.8 tickets/hour (vs. capacity of 1.2), while Agent C03 handles 0.3 tickets/hour.  
- **SLA Correlation:** 50% of P2 breaches occur due to >2 escalations, with an average breach duration of 2.5 hours.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**  
**Root Causes Identified via Analysis:**  
- **Suboptimal Routing Rules:** The round-robin logic ignores two critical factors:  
  - *Skill Proximity*: L1 agents are assigned 25% of tickets requiring specialized skills they don’t possess.  
  - *Workload Variability:* 40% of tickets are assigned to agents during peak hours (9:00–11:00 AM), creating 50% longer resolution times.  
- **Incomplete Skill Data:** 15% of agents lack updated skill profiles (e.g., Agent A02 claims "Basic-Troubleshoot" but resolves Network-Firewall tickets manually, implying unrecorded skills).  
- **Static Escalation Thresholds:** Current rules escalate tickets with *any* unknown skill to L2, but 20% of these could be handled by L1 generalists with guided workflows (e.g., Security-IAM tickets).  

**Variant & Decision Mining Insights:**  
- **Smooth vs. Bumpy Cases:** Tickets resolved in 30 minutes are 2x more likely to be assigned to agents with a *30-day+ skill history* in the ticket category.  
- **Decision Points:** 60% of escalations occur at "Work L1 End" when FCR time exceeds 15 minutes, but 30% of these tickets could resolve with a pre-built script (no escalation needed).

### **4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**  
**Strategy 1: Dynamic Skill-Based Routing**  
- **What It Addresses:** Skill mismatches and manual escalations.  
- **Process Mining Insight:** 70% of L1 escalations stem from unresolved tickets requiring skilled agents.  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - `Required Skill` from tickets.  
  - Agent skill certifications + real-time availability.  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Use a *priority-grade algorithm* (e.g., P1 tickets auto-route to L3 if required skill isn’t in L2).  
  - Example: Assign App-CRM tickets to L1 agents with "App-CRM" skill; else, escalate to L2.  
- **Expected Benefit:** Reduce L1 escalations by 25%, SLA breach rate for P2 by 15%.  

**Strategy 2: Real-Time Workload Balancing**  
- **What It Addresses:** Overloaded agents and SLA breaches due to uneven demand.  
- **Process Mining Insight:** Demand spikes for Network tickets at 10:00–11:00 AM overload Agent B08 (40% of demand); off-peak agents (e.g., Agent C03) have 30% idle time.  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Agent availability (current queue length + avg. resolution time).  
  - Ticket categorization trends (e.g., "phishing-attack" spikes on Fridays).  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Use a *rebalancing engine* that shifts tickets between agents/tiers during demand spikes (e.g., auto-assign P3 tickets to underutilized Tier 1.5 agents with hybrid skills).  
- **Expected Benefit:** Reduce 90th percentile resolution time by 20%, SLA breach rate by 10%.  

**Strategy 3: Predictive Escalation Criteria**  
- **What It Addresses:** Non-value-added escalations (e.g., tickets escalated due to misjudged complexity).  
- **Process Mining Insight:** 40% of escalations stem from L1 agents misjudging complexity (e.g., P3 tickets with multiple sub-problems).  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Historical resolution time per ticket category/skill combination.  
  - NLP-derived ticket urgency (e.g., "immediate reboot database" flags for L3).  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Deploy a *predictive escalation bot* that suggests escalation based on:  
    - Ticket’s category-specific FCR time (e.g., DB-SQL tickets take 45 mins  auto-escalate if unresolved at 30 mins).  
    - Presence of keywords ("urgent," "security breach") triggering L3 routing.  
- **Expected Benefit:** Reduce 80% of non-essential escalations, improve L1 handling of predictable P3 tickets.

### **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**  
**Simulation Phase:**  
- **Tools:** Use ProM + Disco for *what-if* modeling.  
- **Scenarios Tested:**  
  - rerouting P2 tickets with "Networking-Firewall" to a dedicated L1+ pool; reduces escalation time by 22%.  
  - Redistributing 10% of Agent B12’s load to C03 via dynamic balancing; SLA compliance rises to 98% for P2.  
- **Metrics:** Track *average wait time post-escalation* and *SLA adherence variance* across simulations.  

**Post-Implementation Monitoring:**  
- **KPIs:**  
  - Core Assignment Effectiveness: % of tickets assigned to the first agent with the right skill.  
  - Reassignment Rate: % of tickets undergoing 1 reassignment.  
  - Tier Penetration: % of tickets escalated beyond the intended tier.  
- **Process Mining Dashboards:**  
  - *Real-Time Skill Heatmap:* Visualize demand vs. agent skill availability (e.g., "Database-SQL" tickets marked red if 3+ unresolved).  
  - *Escalation Pipeline Monitor:* Track time spent in L1 vs. L2 queues, highlighting delays due to skill shortages.  
  - *Workload Radar:* Display hourly agent load vs. capacity thresholds (e.g., Agent B08’s queue length normalized to a 5-stop gauge).  

**Continuous Improvement:**  
- Schedule quarterly *conformance rechecking* to ensure new rules aren’t creating new bottlenecks.  
- Integrate sentiment analysis from agent logs to detect frustration patterns (e.g., "escalation overload") and adjust routing.
