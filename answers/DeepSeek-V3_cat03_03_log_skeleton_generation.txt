To construct a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process, we need to define the constraints based on the activities and their relationships. Below is an example of how the Log Skeleton might look:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        # Example: If 'Generate Shipping Label' occurs, it has the same occurrences as 'Dispatch'
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch')
    },
    'always_before': {
        # Example: 'Check Availability' must always occur before 'Reserve Items'
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    },
    'always_after': {
        # Example: 'Reserve Items' must always occur after 'Check Availability'
        ('Reserve Items', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Record Payment', 'Invoice Customer')
    },
    'never_together': {
        # Example: 'Receive Order' and 'Dispatch' cannot co-exist in the same case
        ('Receive Order', 'Dispatch')
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        # Bounds the number of occurrences for each activity in a case
        'Receive Order': {1},
        'Check Availability': {1},
        'Reserve Items': {1},
        'Pick Items': {1},
        'Quality Check': {1},
        'Pack Order': {1},
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},
        'Dispatch': {1},
        'Invoice Customer': {1},
        'Record Payment': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        # Example: 'Generate Shipping Label' must directly follow 'Pack Order'
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch')
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Equivalence**: 
   - `('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch')`: If 'Generate Shipping Label' occurs, it must have the same number of occurrences as 'Dispatch'.

2. **Always Before**:
   - Each activity must occur before the next one in the sequence. For example, 'Check Availability' must occur before 'Reserve Items'.

3. **Always After**:
   - Each activity must occur after the previous one in the sequence. For example, 'Reserve Items' must occur after 'Check Availability'.

4. **Never Together**:
   - `('Receive Order', 'Dispatch')`: 'Receive Order' and 'Dispatch' cannot co-exist in the same case.

5. **Activity Occurrences**:
   - Each activity is allowed to occur exactly once in a case.

6. **Directly-Follows Constraints**:
   - `('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label')`: 'Generate Shipping Label' must directly follow 'Pack Order'.
   - `('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch')`: 'Dispatch' must directly follow 'Generate Shipping Label'.

This Log Skeleton provides a declarative model of the order fulfillment process, capturing the essential constraints and relationships between activities.
