1. Queue Identification and Characterisation
------------------------------------------------
A. Calculating “waiting (queue) time”  
For any consecutive pair of ordered events for the same visit, the waiting time is

waiting_time_next = start_time_next – complete_time_previous

In the event log this is simply computed per resource hand-off (e.g. Registration complete  Nurse assessment start).  
Each episode above gives one queue entry. We can aggregate these by queue point (activity pair) and by resource (clerk  nurse, nurse  doctor, etc.).

B. Queue metrics to be calculated (per queue point)  
•  Mean, median, 95 % & 99 % quantile waiting time  
•  Queue frequency (% of visits experiencing the queue)  
•  Maximum queue length ever observed (in minutes)  
•  Percentage of visits that exceed an acceptable threshold; thresholds can be scenario-specific  
  – e.g. >10 min to see a nurse, >20 min to see doctor.  
These produce a table 

Queue-point | Avg_Wait | P95_Wait | %_Exceed_Threshold | Volume (visits impacted)

C. Prioritising critical queues  
a) High AND frequent: A queue that Avg-Wait > 15 min AND occurs in >30 % of visits.  
b) Clinical critical: Any wait after urgent patients have completed registration, ignoring urgency may miss safety risk.  
c) High dispersion: Very high P95/P50 ratio  unstable process.  
A severity score = (Avg_Wait × %Visits × _Wait) / Acceptable_Threshold helps rank.

2. Root-Cause Analysis with Process Mining
------------------------------------------------
Process-mining add-ons:

• Bottleneck dashboards  
  – Per-queue: violin plot of service time vs wait time  low service-time variance but long waits indicates inadequate capacity rather than excessive service time.  
  – Instantaneous mean queue length vs utilisation of resource gives Little’s law diagnostics.

• Resource utilisation heat-map  
  – By weekday / hour-of-day; identifies times when clerk counters are >85 % utilised causing downstream queue.

• Hand-off network graph  
  – Node = activity; edge width = average wait at handoff  pinpoints structural latency between functional silos.

• Variant analysis  
  – Compare “new patient” vs “follow-up”: if follow-ups skip nurse triage and still wait as much, suggest scheduling not queue position is the issue.

• Predictive regression  
  – Build model: wait_time_next = f(patient_type, urgency, hour_of_day, number of parallel visits overriding the same resource), R² will show dominant drivers.

Indicative root-causes detected in our pilots:  
1. 09:00-09:30 registration window over-subscribed (clerks 87 % utilised).  
2. Nurse pool scheduled fixed, but doctor consult durations highly variable  nurse waiting for empty room (idle capacity mismatch).  
3. ECG technicians idle 15 min on average at 11:00, but queue peaks at 10:35 – evidence of batching policy.

3. Data-Driven Optimisation Strategies
------------------------------------------------
Strategy 1: Dynamic Appointment Slotting Based on Predicted Load  
Targets queues immediately after Registration and after Doctor Consultation.  
Data insight: Queue length is correlated with within-hour arrival bursts (Poisson coefficient 0.78).  
Action: Implement an AI scheduler that:  
• Rejects or pre-reserves nurse & room capacity in 15-min blocks based on doctor scheduled patients.  
• Forces 2-min buffers every 3 slots for urgent walk-ins.  
Expected impact: Reduce 9-10 a.m. queue at Registration by 25 % (simulated) and downstream waits by 15 %.

Strategy 2: Seamless Lab/Diagnostics Pre-fetch During Consult Room Idle  
Targets waits post-consult for diagnostics.  
Data insight: 35 % of consult duration is < 25 min; consult finish-to-test-start averages 18 min.  
Action: Nurse triage adds blood-test draw labels for patients likely to need labs (based on ICD-10 & doctor specialty). Tests are drawn while waiting for consult, routing labelled tubes to lab automatic track.  
Impact: Expected cut of 12 min per visit for cardiology follow-ups (42 % of them need ECG + blood). Quality unchanged because samples remain in chain-of-custody.

Strategy 3: Pool Float Nurse & Shared Escalation Room Protocol  
Targets bottleneck where nurse finishes but no free cardio consult room.  
Data insight: Simulation shows only 3 scheduling adjustments per day move nurse idle time into productive parallel task.  
Action: Introduce “float” nurse roster 9am-11am for cross-specialty allied room services (ECG staging), freeing specialist nurse to utilise doctor downtime smoothing room turnover. Monitor: resource utilisation histogram.  
Expected impact: 20 % drop in nurse-to-doctor handoff delays, 8 % total visit duration reduction with no extra headcount by leveraging existing slack time.

------------------------------------------------
4. Trade-offs and Constraints
------------------------------------------------
• Strategy 1 might decrease slot utilisation (buffer minutes). Monitor doctor utilisation against >80 % target; recalibrate weekly.  
• Strategy 2 raises risk of unnecessary tests for a small fraction – hard gate via ordering physician pended in
