The Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process is a critical business process that typically follows a well-defined sequence of steps to ensure proper controls, compliance, and efficiency. A standard P2P process usually involves the following sequence of activities:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition** – A request for goods or services is initiated.
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition** – The request is reviewed and approved by the appropriate authority.
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)** – A formal order is sent to the vendor.
4. **Receive Goods** – The goods or services are received and verified.
5. **Receive Vendor Invoice** – The vendor sends an invoice for the goods or services.
6. **Match Invoice to PO** – The invoice is matched with the purchase order and receiving report (3-way match).
7. **Release Payment** – The payment is authorized and processed.
8. **Close Case** – The process is closed once all steps are completed.

With this understanding, let's analyze the event logs for **anomalies** and **unusual sequences** that may deviate from best practices.

### **Case ID: 1002**

**Sequence of Activities:**

- **Create Purchase Requisition**
- **Issue Purchase Order**
- **Vendor Invoice Received**
- **Release Payment**
- **Approve Purchase Requisition**
- **Receive Goods**
- **Match Invoice to PO**
- **Close Case**

**Anomaly:**
- **Approve Purchase Requisition** occurs **after** **Release Payment** and **Receive Goods**.
- **Receive Goods** and **Vendor Invoice Received** occur **before** **Approve Purchase Requisition**.
- **Issue Purchase Order** occurs **before** **Approve Purchase Requisition**.

**Why It's Problematic:**
- In a standard P2P process, **approval of the purchase requisition** should occur **before** the purchase order is issued. This ensures that the request is authorized and valid before committing to a purchase.
- **Receiving goods** and **receiving an invoice** should occur **after** the purchase order is issued and **after** the requisition is approved.
- **Releasing payment** should only occur **after** the invoice has been matched to the purchase order and goods received, and **after** all approvals are in place.
- **This sequence violates standard control and workflow logic**, potentially allowing unauthorized or unapproved purchases to be processed, which could lead to financial risk, fraud, or non-compliance.

### **Case ID: 1003**

**Sequence of Activities:**

- **Create Purchase Requisition**
- **Approve Purchase Requisition**
- **Issue Purchase Order**
- **Release Payment**
- **Vendor Invoice Received**
- **Receive Goods**
- **Match Invoice to PO**
- **Close Case**

**Anomaly:**
- **Release Payment** occurs **before** **Vendor Invoice Received** and **Receive Goods**.
- **Vendor Invoice Received** and **Receive Goods** occur **after** **Release Payment**.

**Why It's Problematic:**
- **Releasing payment** before receiving goods or an invoice is a **major red flag**.
- In a standard P2P process, **payment should not be released until the goods are received and the invoice is matched** to the purchase order.
- This could result in **unauthorized payments** or **payment for goods that were never delivered**, leading to **financial loss**, **fraud**, or **non-compliance with internal controls**.

### **Case ID: 1004**

**Sequence of Activities:**

- **Create Purchase Requisition**
- **Approve Purchase Requisition**
- **Receive Goods**
- **Issue Purchase Order**
- **Vendor Invoice Received**
- **Match Invoice to PO**
- **Release Payment**
- **Close Case**

**Anomaly:**
- **Issue Purchase Order** occurs **after** **Receive Goods**.

**Why It's Problematic:**
- The **purchase order** should be issued **before** the goods are received.
- Receiving goods **without** a purchase order is a **serious control violation**.
- This could indicate **unauthorized procurement**, **fraud**, or **lack of proper documentation**, which may lead to **inventory discrepancies**, **unauthorized purchases**, or **financial misstatements**.

### **Summary of Anomalies:**

| Case ID | Anomaly Description | Risk/Impact |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| 1002   | Approval of purchase requisition occurs after payment and goods received. | Unauthorized or unapproved purchases, financial risk, non-compliance. |
| 1003   | Payment released before invoice and goods received. | Unauthorized payment, financial loss, fraud risk. |
| 1004   | Purchase order issued after goods received. | Unauthorized procurement, inventory discrepancies, non-compliance. |

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Review and audit these cases** to determine if the anomalies were intentional or due to system errors.
2. **Implement process controls** to enforce the correct sequence of activities in the P2P process.
3. **Train employees** on standard P2P workflows to prevent such anomalies.
4. **Use process mining tools** to detect and flag such deviations automatically in real time.

These anomalies suggest **process control weaknesses** that could lead to **financial loss, fraud, or compliance issues**. Addressing them is essential for maintaining the integrity of the P2P process.
