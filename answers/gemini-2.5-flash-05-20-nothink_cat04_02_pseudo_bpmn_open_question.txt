    *   **Predictive Feasibility:** AI/ML models assess the complexity and likelihood of successful customization based on historical data, material availability, and production capacity. This can provide an initial "go/no-go" signal faster.
    *   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** If deemed potentially feasible, the system dynamically identifies and assigns the most suitable expert (engineer, product specialist) based on their skills, current workload, and availability (e.g., using a skill-based routing engine).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Faster initial assessment and expert allocation.
    *   **Increased Flexibility:** Optimal utilization of specialized human resources.
    *   **Performance:** Improves the success rate of custom projects by assigning the right talent.
    *   **Operational Complexity:** Requires robust HR system integration and skill matrix management.

**7. Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?" -> "Is Customization Feasible? (AI-Assisted Decision)"**

*   **Change:** The AI model's assessment heavily influences or even automates the "no" path for truly infeasible requests, while "yes" path still allows for human review for complex cases.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Quicker rejections for unviable requests, freeing up resources.
    *   **Customer Satisfaction:** Faster feedback, even if negative.

**8. Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation" -> "Dynamic Custom Quotation Generation (AI-Assisted & Human Review)"**

*   **Change:** AI-powered tools assist in generating complex custom quotes by integrating with material databases, labor cost estimations, and design tools. The system can propose initial designs or configurations. Human experts provide final review and sign-off, focusing on high-value judgment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Significant acceleration in quote generation.
    *   **Increased Flexibility:** Can rapidly model different custom configurations.
    *   **Performance:** Higher accuracy and consistency in pricing.

**9. Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice" -> "Automated Rejection Notice & Alternative Offer"**

*   **Change:** Automated, personalized rejection notices with pre-configured templates. Optionally, the system can automatically suggest standard alternatives that might meet some of the customer's needs, turning a rejection into a potential sale.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Instant rejection communication.
    *   **Customer Satisfaction:** Provides proactive alternatives, maintaining goodwill.

**10. New Gateway (XOR): "Automated Approval Threshold Check"**

*   **Change:** A rules engine automatically determines if manager approval is needed based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., order value, product type, new customer, level of customization, discount applied). Most standard, low-value orders bypass approval.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Dramatically reduces approval bottlenecks for routine orders.
    *   **Performance:** Managers focus on high-value, high-risk decisions.

**11. Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval" -> "Dynamic Manager Approval Routing (Skill-Based Routing & Automated Escalation)"**

*   **Change:** Automated routing of approval requests to the most appropriate manager based on their role, expertise, and current workload. Automated escalation rules ensure timely approvals if initial approvers are unavailable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Minimizes delays in obtaining approvals.
    *   **Performance:** Ensures approvals are handled efficiently, even during peak times.

**12. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?" -> "Automated Approval Granted? (Digital Signature / AI Anomaly Detection)"**

*   **Change:** Integrates with digital signature platforms for quick approvals. AI can monitor approval patterns to detect anomalies (e.g., unusually quick approval for complex cases, suspicious rejections) that might warrant human oversight.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Faster and more secure approvals.

**13. Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions" -> "Automated Re-evaluation & Recommendation Engine"**

*   **Change:** If an approval is denied, an AI-driven recommendation engine analyzes the reason for denial and suggests specific adjustments to the quotation or conditions (e.g., suggest a slight price increase, remove a specific customization, offer a different delivery date). This loop then re-engages the relevant paths with revised parameters.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Avoids manual back-and-forth by proactively suggesting solutions.
    *   **Performance:** Higher conversion rates for previously denied requests.

**14. Task G: "Generate Final Invoice" -> "Automated Final Invoice Generation (ERP Integration)"**

*   **Change:** Fully automated invoice generation directly from the approved quotation and order details, integrated with the ERP system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Turnaround:** Instantaneous invoice creation.
    *   **Performance:** Eliminates human error in invoicing.

**15. Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer" -> "Automated Confirmation & Tracking Provision to Customer"**
