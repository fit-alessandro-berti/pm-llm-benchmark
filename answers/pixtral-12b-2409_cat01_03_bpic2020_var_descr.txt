The data you provided describes various variants of a process involving the submission and approval of declarations, ultimately leading to a payment being handled. Here's a breakdown of the underlying process as well as some insights into the data:

### Process Overview
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration.
2. **Declaration APPROVED/REJECTED by various entities**: The declaration is then reviewed and either approved or rejected by different entities such as ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, or sometimes a generic entity like MISSING.
3. **Final Approval**: Once the declaration is approved by the necessary authorities, it reaches the stage of FINAL_APPROVED by the SUPERVISOR.
4. **Request Payment**: The approved declaration triggers a request for payment.
5. **Payment Handled**: The payment is ultimately handled.

### Process Variants
The process variants can be grouped based on different approval paths and rejections:

1. **Direct Approval by Different Authorities**:
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency: 4618, performance: 810187.903)**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency: 2473, performance: 1084338.407)**
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency: 1392, performance: 854633.975)**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency: 575, performance: 861058.409)**

2. **Approval with Rejections**:
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED...** (multiple variants with varying frequencies and performances)
   - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED...** (multiple variants with varying frequencies and performances)

3. **Multiple Rejections**:
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED...** (multiple variants with varying frequencies and performances)

4. **Special Cases**:
   - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE (frequency: 134, performance: 0.000)**: Declarations that were saved by the employee but not submitted or approved.
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency: 77, performance: 1728631.623)**
   - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency: 40, performance: 1947246.400)**

### Insights
- **Most Frequent Paths**: The most frequent paths involve straightforward approvals by the ADMINISTRATION and SUPERVISOR.
- **Rejection and Resubmission**: There are numerous variants involving rejections followed by resubmissions, indicating a common scenario where declarations need multiple reviews and approvals.
- **Performance Values**: The performance values associated with each variant suggest the overall cost or impact of each path. Paths with higher performance values may involve additional steps or higher costs.

### Conclusion
The process underlying this data involves multiple stages of declaration submission, approval, potential rejections, and ultimately payment handling. The complexity arises from the various approval authorities and the need for resubmission in case of rejections, reflecting a robust review process.
