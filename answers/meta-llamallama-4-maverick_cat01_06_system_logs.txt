### Event Log Transformation

The raw Windows system log has been transformed into a process mining event log. Below is the resulting event log table.

### Logic Explanation

To create the event log, the following steps were taken:

1. **Case Identification**: Cases were identified based on the application and document being worked on. A new case is started when the user begins interacting with a new document or application that is not part of an existing case. For example, when the user starts editing "Document1.docx", it is considered Case_1. Later, when the user switches to "Email - Inbox" in Google Chrome, it is considered Case_2.

2. **Activity Naming**: Activity names were standardized based on the actions performed. For instance, "TYPING" in Microsoft Word is translated to "Edit Document". "CLICK" with "Action=Open Email" is translated to "Open Email", and subsequent actions on the same email are part of the same case.

3. **Event Attributes**: The event log includes the Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Application, and Window Title. These attributes provide a clear understanding of the activities performed within each case.

4. **Coherent Narrative**: The resulting event log tells a story of the user's work session, where multiple cases represent different tasks or documents being worked on. For example, Case_1 represents the creation and editing of "Document1.docx", while Case_2 involves handling an email.

The cases and activities were determined based on the context of the application and the actions performed. The event log provides a clear and structured representation of the user's workflow, allowing for further process mining analysis. 

### Rationale for Case Identification and Activity Naming

- **Case_1 (Document1.docx)**: The user creates a new document, edits it, saves it, and then closes it. This represents a single case of document creation and editing.
- **Case_2 (Email - Inbox)**: The user opens an email, replies to it, and sends the reply. This is a single case of handling an email.
- **Case_3 (Report_Draft.pdf)**: The user reviews a PDF document and highlights text. This represents a case of document review.
- **Case_4 (Budget_2024.xlsx)**: The user edits a spreadsheet and saves it. This is a case of spreadsheet editing.
- **Case_5 (Quarterly_Report.docx)**: The user edits a report, saves it, and then closes it. This is another case of document editing.

Each case represents a distinct task or document being worked on by the user. The activities within each case are ordered chronologically based on the timestamp.
