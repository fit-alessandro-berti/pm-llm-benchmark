# Data-Driven Job Shop Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Process Mining for Job and Task Flow Reconstruction

To reconstruct and analyze the actual flow of jobs through Precision Parts Inc.'s manufacturing system, I would employ several complementary process mining techniques:

1. **Process Discovery**: Using algorithms such as the Inductive Miner or Heuristics Miner to extract the as-is process model from event logs, revealing the actual routing patterns of jobs through different machines, including unexpected deviations from planned routings.

2. **Variant Analysis**: Identifying the most common process variants by clustering similar job pathways, which helps understand the diversity of job routings and their relative frequencies.

3. **Animation and Replay**: Creating visual replay animations of how jobs flowed through the system over time, highlighting queue buildups, resource contentions, and flow interruptions.

4. **Social Network Analysis**: Examining the "handover of work" relationships between machines to identify critical transfer points or communication breakdowns in the production flow.

### Key Performance Metrics and Their Extraction

#### Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions

- **Flow Time Analysis**: Calculate the distribution of total job flow time (from job release to completion) for each job type, using timestamps from the event log.
- **Lead Time Decomposition**: Break down lead times into value-adding processing time, setup time, and non-value-adding waiting time to identify improvement opportunities.
- **Makespan Analysis**: For batches of jobs released in the same time period, analyze the time required to complete the entire batch, which provides insights into system throughput.

#### Task Waiting Times

- **Queue Time Extraction**: For each task, calculate the duration between "Queue Entry" and "Setup Start" or "Task Start" events to determine waiting times.
- **Queue Time Distribution by Work Center**: Generate statistical distributions of waiting times for each work center to identify problematic queuing areas.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze how queue times correlate with factors such as shop load, time of day, job priority, and machine availability.

#### Resource Utilization

- **Activity Ratio Analysis**: Calculate the percentage of time each resource spends in different states: productive (task execution), setup, idle, and down.
- **Utilization Patterns**: Analyze temporal patterns in utilization, creating heat maps to visualize peak load periods and potential underutilization.
- **Operator-Machine Coupling Analysis**: Examine the relationship between operator assignments and machine productivity to identify optimal pairings.

#### Sequence-Dependent Setup Times

- **Setup Matrix Construction**: Create a matrix showing average setup times between different job types by analyzing consecutive "Setup Start" and "Setup End" events on the same machine.
- **Setup Time Regression Model**: Develop a predictive model that estimates setup time based on job attributes of both current and previous jobs.
- **Setup Time Variance Analysis**: Identify factors contributing to variability in setup times by analyzing job attributes, operators, and contextual factors.

#### Schedule Adherence and Tardiness

- **Due Date Performance**: Calculate tardiness metrics including:
  - Percentage of jobs completed late
  - Average tardiness (in time units)
  - Distribution of tardiness severity
  - Tardiness concentration by job type or customer
- **Schedule Deviation Tracking**: Compare planned task durations with actual durations to identify systematic estimation errors.
- **Critical Ratio Analysis**: Calculate the ratio of remaining time until due date divided by the remaining processing time, tracking how this ratio evolves throughout job execution.

#### Impact of Disruptions

- **Conformance Checking**: Compare actual process execution against the planned schedule to identify deviations caused by disruptions.
- **Recovery Time Analysis**: Measure how long the system takes to recover normal performance levels after disruptions of different types and magnitudes.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### Key Pathologies and Inefficiencies

#### Bottleneck Identification and Impact Quantification

- **Throughput Analysis**: Using process mining, I would identify machines with the highest utilization and lowest idle time, particularly focusing on resources where jobs consistently accumulate in queues.
- **Waiting Time Contribution**: Quantify how much of the total lead time is spent waiting for specific bottleneck resources, showing their disproportionate impact on overall performance.
- **Evidence Generation**: Produce time-series visualizations showing the relationship between bottleneck utilization and overall shop performance metrics (WIP, flow time, tardiness).

#### Poor Task Prioritization

- **Due Date Performance by Priority Level**: Process mining would reveal whether high-priority jobs actually receive preferential treatment in practice or if the priority system is ineffective.
- **Priority-Flow Time Correlation**: Analyze whether higher priority correlates with shorter flow times as expected, or if the relationship is weak.
- **Decision Point Analysis**: At key decision points (when multiple jobs are waiting for the same resource), examine which job was selected and whether this choice aligned with stated prioritization rules.

#### Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Times

- **Setup Time Network Analysis**: Create and visualize a network of job transitions on each machine, with edge weights representing setup times, to identify frequently occurring high-setup transitions.
- **Comparative Sequence Analysis**: Compare actual job sequences against optimal or near-optimal sequences (from a setup time perspective) to quantify the efficiency gap.
- **Setup Time Waste Quantification**: Calculate the total excess setup time incurred due to non-optimal sequencing across different machines and time periods.

#### Resource Starvation Patterns

- **Starvation Detection**: Identify periods where downstream machines are idle despite having jobs in the system, indicating poor flow coordination.
- **Feed Rate Analysis**: Compare the rate at which upstream processes complete tasks versus the consumption rate of downstream processes.
- **Critical Path Tracing**: For late jobs, trace back through the process to identify whether starvation at specific points contributed to delays.

#### WIP Bullwhip Effect

- **WIP Level Fluctuation Analysis**: Examine the variance in WIP levels across work centers over time, looking for amplification patterns.
- **Cross-Correlation Analysis**: Measure how WIP variations at one work center correlate with delayed variations at downstream centers.
- **Release Pattern Impact**: Analyze how job release patterns affect subsequent WIP fluctuations throughout the shop floor.

### Process Mining Techniques for Pathology Evidence

- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Apply specialized algorithms like the Active Period Method or Critical Path Method to objectively identify bottlenecks from event logs.
- **Variant Comparative Analysis**: Compare process variants of on-time versus late jobs to identify execution patterns associated with delays.
- **Performance Spectrum Analysis**: Visualize the performance spectrum to show how specific resources perform over time, highlighting periods of contention, starvation, and inefficient sequencing.
- **Decision Mining**: At key scheduling decision points, analyze what factors most influenced the actual resource allocation decisions and evaluate their effectiveness.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules

- **Rule Consistency Analysis**: Process mining would reveal whether the stated rules (FCFS, EDD) are consistently applied or frequently overridden based on actual job sequences.
- **Rule Performance by Context**: Analyze how well these simple rules perform under different shop load conditions, uncovering situations where they systematically fail.
- **Dynamic Condition Impact**: Quantify how changing conditions (machine breakdowns, urgent orders) undermine the effectiveness of static rules.

### Lack of Real-Time Shop Floor Visibility

- **Decision Delay Analysis**: Measure the time lag between status changes (machine becoming available) and resulting actions (next job being assigned).
- **Information Utilization Gap**: Compare actual decisions against what would have been optimal decisions given perfect information about the shop floor state.
- **Propagation of Status Information**: Analyze how quickly (or slowly) information about disruptions propagates to affect scheduling decisions at other work centers.

### Inaccurate Task Duration Estimations

- **Estimation Accuracy Analysis**: Compare planned versus actual task durations to identify systematic over/underestimation patterns.
- **Variance Analysis by Job Type**: Calculate the coefficient of variation for task durations by job type, machine, and operator to identify areas with poor predictability.
- **Learning Curve Effects**: Determine whether estimation accuracy improves over time for recurring job types, or if systematic errors persist.

### Ineffective Setup Time Management

- **Setup Opportunity Analysis**: Identify instances where optimal sequencing could have significantly reduced setup times.
- **Setup Knowledge Transfer**: Analyze whether setup performance varies significantly by operator, indicating knowledge sharing gaps.
- **Setup Planning Integration**: Determine whether setup considerations factored into observed scheduling decisions or were largely ignored.

### Poor Inter-Work Center Coordination

- **Work Center Synchronization Analysis**: Identify mismatches in production rates between sequential work centers, leading to starvation or blocking.
- **Buffer Sizing Effectiveness**: Analyze whether WIP buffers between work centers are appropriately sized based on observed processing time variations.
- **Transfer Batch Optimization**: Examine whether transfer batch sizes are optimized to balance setup efficiency against smooth flow.

### Inadequate Disruption Response

- **Disruption Recovery Pattern Analysis**: Identify typical response patterns following disruptions and evaluate their effectiveness.
- **Rescheduling Delay Impact**: Measure the time between a disruption occurring and schedule adjustments being implemented, and the corresponding impact on performance.
- **Cascading Effect Quantification**: For major disruptions, trace and quantify the ripple effects throughout the production system.

### Differentiating Scheduling Logic Issues from Resource Limitations

- **Capacity Utilization Analysis**: Determine whether bottlenecks operate at full capacity during available time, indicating a true capacity constraint rather than a scheduling issue.
- **Idle Time Pattern Analysis**: Analyze when and why resources sit idle—if idle periods occur despite available jobs, this suggests scheduling logic problems.
- **Counterfactual Simulation**: Using parameters extracted from process mining, simulate alternative scheduling approaches to separate the impact of logic limitations from fundamental capacity constraints.
- **Variability Impact Quantification**: Decompose performance issues into components attributable to process variability versus components attributable to scheduling decisions.

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Factor Dispatching with Predictive Setup Minimization

This strategy enhances traditional dispatching with a sophisticated scoring mechanism that dynamically adjusts weights based on current shop conditions.

**Core Logic**:
- Implement a composite dispatching rule where each waiting job receives a score based on multiple weighted factors:
  - Critical Ratio (CR): (Due Date - Current Date) / Remaining Processing Time
  - Setup Time Efficiency (STE): Predicted setup time if this job follows the current job
  - Downstream Impact Score (DIS): Estimated impact on downstream resource utilization
  - Global Priority Factor (GPF): Original job priority, adjusted for tardiness risk
  
- The final priority score follows this formula:
  ```
  Score = (w × normalized CR) + (w × normalized STE) + (w × normalized DIS) + (w × normalized GPF)
  ```
  
- The weights (w, w, w, w) dynamically adjust based on:
  - Current shop load (increasing w when system is heavily loaded)
  - Bottleneck status (increasing w when feeding bottlenecks)
  - Setup time impact (increasing w when at machines with high setup time variance)

**Process Mining Integration**:
- The setup time prediction model is built using historical setup time data from the event logs, accounting for job attributes and transition patterns.
- Downstream impact scores are calculated using historical flow patterns and current queue lengths.
- Weight adjustment rules are derived from correlation analysis between factor values and job performance outcomes in historical data.

**Pathologies Addressed**:
- Poor task prioritization: By considering multiple factors simultaneously
- Suboptimal sequencing: Through explicit setup time consideration
- Bottleneck starvation: By incorporating downstream impact
- Tardiness: By emphasizing critical ratio for at-risk jobs

**Expected Impact**:
- 30-40% reduction in average tardiness
- 15-25% reduction in total setup time
- 10-15% improvement in bottleneck utilization
- More consistent and predictable lead times

### Strategy 2: Predictive-Reactive Scheduling with Dynamic Buffer Management

This strategy combines initial optimization-based scheduling with continuous adaptation and buffer management.

**Core Logic**:
- Create an initial baseline schedule using a rolling-horizon optimization approach that:
  - Considers known jobs and their routings
  - Incorporates probabilistic task durations derived from historical data
  - Explicitly accounts for sequence-dependent setup times
  - Allocates strategic time buffers based on historical variability
  
- Implement a continuous rescheduling mechanism that:
  - Monitors execution vs. plan in real-time
  - Triggers targeted rescheduling when deviations exceed thresholds
  - Preserves schedule stability by limiting changes to a rolling time window
  - Applies different rescheduling strategies for different disruption types
  
- Employ dynamic buffer management that:
  - Adjusts time buffers based on current system status
  - Explicitly protects bottleneck resources with larger buffers
  - Shrinks buffers during periods of low variability

**Process Mining Integration**:
- Task duration distributions are derived from historical performance data, segmented by job type, machine, and operator.
- Deviation thresholds for rescheduling triggers are set based on historical performance variance analysis.
- Buffer sizing rules are informed by historical variability patterns at different work centers and under different load conditions.
- Machine breakdown probability models are developed from historical maintenance event data.

**Pathologies Addressed**:
- Unpredictable lead times: Through realistic probabilistic scheduling
- Impact of disruptions: Via targeted rescheduling strategies
- Bottleneck utilization: By protecting critical resources with strategic buffers
- Bullwhip effect: Through controlled, stability-preserving rescheduling

**Expected Impact**:
- 40-50% improvement in schedule adherence
- 20-30% reduction in average flow time
- 25-35% reduction in WIP inventory
- Significantly improved ability to provide accurate delivery date estimates to customers

### Strategy 3: Bottleneck-Centered Synchronization with Controlled WIP

This strategy focuses on maximizing bottleneck utilization through coordinated feeding and strategic WIP control.

**Core Logic**:
- Implement hierarchical scheduling where:
  - Bottleneck resources are scheduled first, optimizing for utilization and minimizing setup time
  - Non-bottleneck upstream resources are scheduled to ensure timely feeding of bottlenecks
  - Non-bottleneck downstream resources are scheduled to maintain flow after bottleneck processing
  
- Apply CONWIP (Constant Work-In-Process) principles with:
  - Dynamic WIP caps calculated based on current system state
  - WIP level monitoring and control at strategic points
  - Job release policies synchronized with bottleneck completion rates
  
- Deploy setup time optimization through:
  - Family-based batching at bottleneck resources
  - Sequence-dependent setup optimization using simulated annealing
  - Dynamic batch sizing that balances setup efficiency against flow requirements

**Process Mining Integration**:
- Bottleneck identification is based on historical utilization patterns and queue time contributions.
- CONWIP limits are calculated using Little's Law applied to historical throughput and target lead times.
- Setup time patterns at bottlenecks are mined to identify optimal family definitions and sequencing rules.
- The relationship between WIP levels and throughput is modeled from historical performance data to set optimal WIP caps.

**Pathologies Addressed**:
- High WIP: Through explicit CONWIP control
- Bottleneck starvation: By prioritizing bottleneck feeding
- Excessive setup times: Via family-based batching at critical resources
- Poor resource utilization: By focusing on bottleneck optimization

**Expected Impact**:
- 15-25% increase in overall throughput
- 30-40% reduction in WIP inventory
- 25-35% reduction in bottleneck setup time
- More balanced resource utilization across the shop floor
