Based on the data provided, it appears to be a workflow or approval process for handling declarations and payments within an organization. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

1. **Employee Submission**: An employee submits a declaration. This is the initial step where the employee provides all necessary information and documentation for the declaration. The submission could be for various reasons, such as expense claims, time off requests, or other types of declarations that require approval from different levels of management.

2. **Employee Saves**: In some cases, an employee may choose to save their declaration before submitting it, possibly to make further adjustments or complete additional steps required for submission.

3. **Pre-Approval**: Once submitted, the declaration enters the pre-approval stage. A designated 'Pre-Approver' reviews the declaration to ensure all information is correct and complete. This person can either approve the declaration or reject it if something is amiss.

4. **Budget Owner Review**: If the Pre-Approver approves the declaration, it then goes to the 'Budget Owner' for review. The Budget Owner checks if the declaration aligns with the budget and can approve or reject it accordingly.

5. **Supervisor Review**: After approval from the Budget Owner, the declaration moves on to the 'Supervisor.' The Supervisor reviews the declaration and either finalizes the approval (by marking it 'FINAL_APPROVED') or rejects it if there are concerns or discrepancies.

6. **Administration Review**: In cases where the declaration is sent back for further review (either by a Pre-Approver, Supervisor, or Budget Owner), it may eventually reach the 'Administration' level. Administration reviews the declaration and can either approve it or send it back to the previous stage.

7. **Payment Handling**: Once all levels of approval are obtained (ending with 'FINAL_APPROVED'), the declaration is ready for payment processing, which is noted as 'Payment Handled.'

8. **Rejections and Resubmissions**: If at any point a declaration is rejected by an approver, it may go back to the employee for corrections or additional information. This can result in multiple rejections and resubmissions until the declaration is approved.

9. **Missing Approval**: There are instances where the workflow seems to be stuck ('Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'), which might indicate a glitch or an administrative oversight in the system where no specific approver has taken action within a certain timeframe, leading to a hold-up in the process.

10. **Directly-Follows Constraints**: These are special cases that define the sequence of events. For example, if a 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' is rejected due to missing information or approval (by 'MISSING'), it directly follows that the process may be stuck without progressing further. Similarly, declarations submitted for approval by Administration or Pre-Approver can end up being saved by the Employee again, indicating a need for additional work before submission.

In summary, this data outlines an automated approval process with multiple stages of review and potential loops back to previous stages for corrections or clarifications. The process is designed to ensure that declarations are reviewed by different stakeholders before moving forward to payment handling.
