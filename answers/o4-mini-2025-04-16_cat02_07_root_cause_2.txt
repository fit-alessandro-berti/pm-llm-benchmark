1. Cases with significantly extended durations  
   • Case 2002 (Medium complexity, Region B): from 20240401 09:05 to 20240402 11:00 – ~25 h55 m  
   • Case 2003 (High complexity, Region A): from 20240401 09:10 to 20240403 09:30 – ~48 h20 m  
   • Case 2005 (High complexity, Region B): from 20240401 09:25 to 20240404 14:30 – ~77 h05 m  

2. Correlation of attributes with longer lead times  
   • Complexity  
     – Mediumcomplexity (Case 2002) required one “Request Additional Documents” and then waited overnight for response.  
     – Highcomplexity (Cases 2003, 2005) triggered multiple backandforth requests (2 in Case 2003, 3 in Case 2005), each adding days of delay.  
   • Resource (Adjuster)  
     – Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) on Case 2005 issued three document requests over three days, suggesting either a stricter requirements checklist or slower handling.  
     – Adjuster_Mike (Region A) on Case 2003 issued two requests, with the second late in the day, pushing approval to the next business day.  
   • Region  
     – Both Region A and B see delays for highcomplexity claims, but Region B’s Case 2005 had the worst performance, hinting at possible regional customer response lags or process inefficiencies.  
   • Manager  
     – Manager_Bill’s approval in Case 2003 occurred late on Day 2 (16:00), whereas Manager_Ann in other regions often approved earlier in the morning, contributing to the lateness.  

3. Rootcause explanations  
   – Highcomplexity claims inherently need more verification, but inconsistent checklists across adjusters lead to multiple document requests rather than a single, comprehensive request.  
   – Adjusters may differ in their urgency and thoroughness: issuing repeated requests instead of bundling needed documentation.  
   – Customer response times to requests often exceed sameday turnaround, causing overnight or multiday waits.  
   – Regional factors—such as customer demographics, timezone differences or local holidays—can exacerbate response delays.  
   – Manager availability late in the day can push approvals into the next business day.  

4. Recommendations to mitigate performance issues  
   – Standardize and enhance the initial document checklist for highcomplexity claims so that adjusters can request all required evidence in a single communication.  
   – Implement servicelevel agreements (SLAs) for customer responses (e.g., 24 h to supply documents) and automated reminders.  
   – Provide adjuster training on efficient bundling of document requests and prioritization of highcomplexity cases.  
   – Introduce an “afterhours” or escalation protocol for approvals to avoid endofday bottlenecks (e.g., allocate a backup manager for lateday signoffs).  
   – Monitor regional turnaround metrics and, where necessary, assign cases dynamically to regions or resources with faster response profiles.
