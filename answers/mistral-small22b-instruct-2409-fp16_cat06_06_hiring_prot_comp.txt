 The provided data outlines different patient pathways in a healthcare setting, showing the various steps from registration to discharge and highlighting the frequency (number of instances) and performance (possibly a measure of cost or resource usage) for each pathway. Here are the main differences observed:

### Pathway Differences:
1. **Direct Successful Treatment**:
   - **I successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 225, performance = 48007.484): This is a simple pathway where patients register and are discharged after successful treatment without any intermediate thorough examination or expert consultation.

2. **Thorough Examination before Treatment**:
   - **Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 190, performance = 48007.142): This pathway includes more steps with expert and thorough examinations before diagnosis and treatment.
   - **Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 192, performance = 220004.479): Similar to the first but with registration at an emergency room instead of a family doctor's office.
   - **Register at FD -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 82, performance = 160013.378): This pathway omits the expert examination step but includes a thorough examination.

3. **Unsuccessful Initial Treatments**:
   - **Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 190, performance = 48007.142): Patients undergo multiple treatments after an initial failure before being discharged successfully.
   - **Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 102, performance = 420013.686): Similar to the above but with registration starting at an emergency room.
   - **Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 100, performance = 480010.220): Includes an examination step before the thorough examination.
   - **Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 97, performance = 480017.887): Similar to the above but starting at an emergency room.
   - **Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 88, performance = 420006.864): Pathway without thorough examination but with multiple treatment steps after initial failure.
   - **Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 40, performance = 639982.275): Pathway involving repeated treatment failures and additional examinations before success.
   - **Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 32, performance = 420020.000): Pathway without thorough or expert examination but multiple treatments after initial failure.
   - **Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 30, performance = 419974.900): Similar to above but starting at an emergency room.
   - **Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge** (frequency = 29, performance = 380074.900): Pathway that starts with thorough examination before subsequent treatment steps and success.

### Performance Differences:
- **Cost/Resource Usage**: Pathways involving multiple examinations and unsuccessful treatments have higher performance metrics (likely cost or resource usage), indicating a more complex and expensive journey for the patient. For example, pathways starting with emergency room registration often have higher performance metrics compared to those starting at family doctor’s offices, suggesting potentially higher costs in urgent care settings.

### Frequency Differences:
- **Direct Successful Pathways**: The most frequent pathway (I successful -> Discharge) highlights the simplicity and effectiveness of direct treatment when possible.
- **Complex Pathways with Multiple Treatments**: More complex pathways, particularly those starting at family doctor offices, have high frequencies indicating common scenarios where thorough examinations and multiple treatments are necessary before achieving success.

### Implications:
The data underscores the need for efficient diagnostic and treatment protocols to minimize the number of steps patients must go through, especially in cases involving unsuccessful initial treatments. Additionally, there is a clear indication that registration points (FD vs ER) can significantly impact the resource intensity and cost of care.

By analyzing these differences, healthcare providers and policymakers can work towards optimizing patient pathways to improve both clinical outcomes and resource utilization efficiency.
