**Step-by-Step Reasoning**

1. **Calculate and Compare Total Resolution Times**  
   Let’s first determine the total resolution time for each case. The total resolution time is measured from the "Receive Ticket" activity to the "Close Ticket" activity.

   - **Case 101:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:00 (Receive Ticket)
     - End: 2024-03-01 10:15 (Close Ticket)
     - Total Duration: ~2 hours 15 minutes

   - **Case 102:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:05 (Receive Ticket)
     - End: 2024-03-02 09:15 (Close Ticket)
     - Total Duration: From March 1, 08:05 to March 2, 09:15 is approximately 25 hours 10 minutes.

   - **Case 103:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:10 (Receive Ticket)
     - End: 2024-03-01 09:30 (Close Ticket)
     - Total Duration: ~1 hour 20 minutes

   - **Case 104:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:20 (Receive Ticket)
     - End: 2024-03-02 08:30 (Close Ticket)
     - Total Duration: From March 1, 08:20 to March 2, 08:30 is approximately 24 hours 10 minutes.

   - **Case 105:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:25 (Receive Ticket)
     - End: 2024-03-03 09:30 (Close Ticket)
     - Total Duration: From March 1, 08:25 to March 3, 09:30 is roughly 49 hours 5 minutes.

   **Summary of Durations:**
   - Case 101: ~2h 15m
   - Case 102: ~25h 10m
   - Case 103: ~1h 20m
   - Case 104: ~24h 10m
   - Case 105: ~49h 5m

   Clearly, Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times compared to Cases 101 and 103.

2. **Identify Patterns and Potential Root Causes**  
   By looking at the sequence of activities, we can try to determine what differentiates the quickly resolved tickets from the slower ones.

   - **Escalations:**
     - **Case 102** and **Case 105** both involve an "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" activity. This extra step is not present in the fastest-resolved cases (101 and 103).
     - Escalations likely introduce additional wait times because specialized teams (Level-2 Agents) may have different priorities or queues.

   - **Long Waiting Times Before Investigation or Resolution:**
     - **Case 104** doesn’t explicitly show an escalation, but it does have a large delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:30) and "Investigate Issue" (13:00). Additionally, after the issue is investigated at 13:00, the ticket isn't resolved until the following day at 08:00. This suggests long waiting periods either due to complexity of the issue, resource constraints, or backlog.
     - **Case 102** similarly has a delay: after escalation to Level-2 at 11:30 on March 1, the "Investigate Issue" step only happens at 14:00, and then the ticket isn't resolved until the next day at 09:00. This long gap indicates a potential queue or backlog issue after escalation.
     - **Case 105** also shows a large gap post-escalation: it’s escalated at 10:00 on March 1, but the next "Investigate Issue" doesn’t occur until 14:00 on March 2 (a full day later), and is only resolved on March 3. This is a very significant delay.

   - **No Significant Delays in Non-Escalated, Quickly Resolved Cases:**
     - **Cases 101 and 103**, which are resolved rapidly, show a straightforward sequence: receive, triage, assign to L1, investigate, resolve, and close. No escalation, and each activity follows the previous one relatively quickly.

3. **How These Factors Lead to Increased Cycle Times**
   - **Escalations to Level-2 Agents:**  
     When a ticket requires escalation, it typically enters a secondary queue managed by a more specialized team. This can introduce longer wait times due to:
     - Limited availability of Level-2 Agents.
     - Higher complexity issues that take longer to investigate.
     - Communication and handover delays between Level-1 and Level-2 support groups.

   - **Resource Constraints and Scheduling Delays:**  
     Long gaps between activities such as "Assign to L1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue," or between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket," suggest possible resource bottlenecks. Agents may be overloaded or have to juggle multiple tickets, causing extended waiting periods.

   - **Complexity and External Dependencies:**  
     Especially for escalated or complex tickets, the delay might stem from the need for additional information, dependency on external vendors, or waiting on specialized diagnostic tools. Such complexities naturally elongate the resolution timeline.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - **Improve Escalation Process:**  
     Streamlining the handover to Level-2 agents can shorten wait times. This could involve:
     - Setting stricter service-level agreements (SLAs) for Level-2 response.
     - Increasing the capacity of Level-2 teams or providing additional training to Level-1 agents to reduce the volume of escalations.
   
   - **Manage Workload and Prioritize Tasks:**
     - Implement workload balancing or introduce a workforce management tool to ensure tickets are investigated promptly after assignment.
     - Introduce a prioritization framework that ensures long-pending tickets are tackled in a timely manner.

   - **Process Automation and Monitoring:**
     - Automated alerts when a ticket remains in a queue for too long could prompt immediate action.
     - Regular monitoring and reporting on key metrics (like "time from escalation to investigation" and "time from investigation to resolution") can help identify recurring bottlenecks.

   - **Training and Knowledge Management:**
     - Providing Level-1 agents with better training and access to a comprehensive knowledge base might reduce the need for escalations.
     - Ensuring that common issues can be resolved at Level-1 or more quickly triaged could significantly cut down on overall cycle times.

**In Summary:**

- **Cases with Significant Delays:** Cases 102, 104, and 105 stand out due to much longer resolution times, largely caused by escalations (in 102 and 105) and extended waiting periods during the investigation and resolution phases (in all three long cases, but particularly pronounced in 104 and 105).

- **Root Causes:** Escalation to Level-2 support teams and lengthy idle times between activities are key factors causing these delays.

- **Recommendations:** Streamline escalation procedures, ensure adequate staffing and workload management for more timely resolution, and enhance training and knowledge resources to enable faster problem-solving at Level-1.
