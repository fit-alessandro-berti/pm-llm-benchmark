 Certainly! A "Purchase-to-Pay" (P2P) process generally involves several steps such as placing an order, receiving goods, checking goods, and paying for the goods. Here is an example of how to implement a simple Purchase-to-Pay process tree in pm4py:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Root process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Define the activities
place_order = ProcessTree(label="Place Order", parent=root)
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=root)
check_goods = ProcessTree(label="Check Goods", parent=root)
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay Invoice", parent=root)

# Add the activities as children of the root process tree
root.children.append(place_order)
root.children.append(receive_goods)
root.children.append(check_goods)
root.children.append(pay_invoice)

# Define parallel execution for "Receive Goods" and "Check Goods"
parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
receive_goods.parent = parallel  # Set the new parent
check_goods.parent = parallel    # Set the new parent
parallel.children.append(receive_goods)
parallel.children.append(check_goods)

# Add the parallel block to the root process tree
root.children.append(parallel)

# Define exclusive choice for "Check Goods" and "Pay Invoice"
exclusive_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
check_goods.parent = exclusive_choice  # Set the new parent
pay_invoice.parent = exclusive_choice   # Set the new parent
exclusive_choice.children.append(check_goods)
exclusive_choice.children.append(pay_invoice)

# Add the exclusive choice block to the root process tree
root.children.append(exclusive_choice)

# Now you can use this `root` ProcessTree object as needed in your Purchase-to-Pay process implementation
```

This code creates a simple Purchase-to-Pay process tree with the following structure:
1. Place Order (sequential)
2. Receive Goods and Check Goods executed in parallel
3. An exclusive choice between checking goods again or paying the invoice after receiving/checking the goods

This mimics a typical Purchase-to-Pay process where receiving and checking are done in parallel, followed by either more checks or direct payment.
