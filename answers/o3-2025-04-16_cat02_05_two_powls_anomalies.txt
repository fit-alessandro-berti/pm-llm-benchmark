1.  Benchmark: “ideal” HiretoRetire sequence  
   Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  
    Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case  
   (each activity once, all mandatory).


2.  Anomalies in the two POWL models

A) Model 1  (Strict partial order)

1. Interview can lag behind the decision  
   • Screen_Candidates precedes both Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision,  
     but there is no edge Interview  Decide.  
   • Result: The hiring decision may be taken before any interview has been
     completed – clearly illogical.

2. Case can be closed while interviewing is still running  
   • Interview is not ordered w.r.t. Payroll or Close_Case.  
   • A trace Post  …  Payroll  Close_Case  (late) Interview is allowed.

3. Parallelism instead of real choice  
   • Decide and Interview are forced to occur (there is no XOR).  
     That is not wrong, but unusual – usually you either interview all
     shortlisted candidates first and only then decide.

Gravity: one severe rule violation (decision before/without interviews) plus an
integrity problem (closing while still interviewing), but every activity is
mandatory and executed only once.


B) Model 2  (loop and XOR operators)

1. Screening may happen after the interview  
   • Post_Job_Ad  Screen and Post_Job_Ad  Interview are concurrent.  
   • Hence candidates may be interviewed before their résumé is screened.

2. Payroll is optional  
   • XOR(Payroll, skip) allows the path “… Onboard  skip  Close”.  
   • A hired employee who never enters the payroll system is a critical
     breach of HR and legal requirements.

3. Reonboarding loop  
   • LOOP(Onboard, skip) executes Onboard at least once but may repeat it
     indefinitely. Multiple onboardings for the same hire are illogical, can
     create data duplicates and additional costs.

4. Screening not prerequisite for decision  
   • Interview  Decide, but no Screen  Decide edge. The decision may come
     before screening is finished.

Gravity: two severe anomalies (missing Payroll, unlimited reonboarding) and
the same “screening after interview” / “decision before screening” issue.


3.  Which model is “closer to normal”?

• Model 1 always puts a new employee on the payroll, never onboards more than
  once, and contains a trace that is exactly the normative sequence
  (Interview may finish before Decide, satisfying the ideal order).  
• Model 2, although it enforces “Interview before Decision”, allows the much
  more serious omission of Payroll and the absurd repetition of Onboard.

Therefore, Model 1 is the better approximation of a standard HiretoRetire
process. Its anomalies affect temporal ordering but not the fundamental
business obligations (paying the employee, unique onboarding), whereas Model 2
endangers both legal compliance (payroll) and data integrity (looped
onboarding).
