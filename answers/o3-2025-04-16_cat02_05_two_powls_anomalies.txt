1.  What the “textbook” Hire-to-Retire process looks like  

   1. Post_Job_Ad  
   2. Screen_Candidates  
   3. Conduct_Interviews  
   4. Make_Hiring_Decision  
      – If “no-hire”, the case is simply closed.  
      – If “hire”, continue with:  
   5. Onboard_Employee  
   6. Add_to_Payroll  
   7. Close_Case  

   Mandatory orderings:  
   • Post  Screen  Interview  Decision  
   • Decision (“hire” branch)  Onboard  Payroll  Close  
   • Optional “reject” branch: Decision (“no-hire”)  Close  
   • No activity may be repeated except the optional loop “back to Post” when the position is reopened (not modelled here).

2.  Analysis of the two models  

   ---------------------------------------------------  
   Model 1 (StrictPartialOrder)  
   ---------------------------------------------------  
   Encoded precedence   
       Post  Screen   
       Screen  Decide   
       Screen  Interview                (no relation DecideInterview)  
       Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  

   Detected anomalies  

   A1  Decision may occur before the interview  
       Because Decide and Interview are unordered, the decision can be taken in parallel with – or even earlier than – the interview.  
        Severe: violates the core business rule that you interview before deciding.  

   A2  No possibility to reject a candidate  
       Every execution passes through Onboard, Payroll and Close.  
        Medium: ignores the “no-hire” outcome that exists in every real process.  

   A3  Interviews are strictly after Screening (fine), but a second screening round after interviews is impossible (minor flexibility issue).  

   ---------------------------------------------------  
   Model 2 (Loop + XOR)  
   ---------------------------------------------------  
   Encoded precedence   
       Post  {Screen  Interview}        (can run in parallel)  
       Interview  Decision  
       Decision  LOOP(Onboard)           (Onboard may repeat)  
       LOOP(Onboard)  XOR{Payroll | }   (Payroll optional)  
       XOR  Close  

   Detected anomalies  

   B1  Screening is not enforced before either Interviews or the Decision  
       – Interviews may start before screening finishes.  
       – The decision is guaranteed to come after the interview, but not necessarily after screening.  
        Moderate: undesirable, but at least the main evaluation (interview) precedes the decision.  

   B2  Payroll is optional (XOR with silent transition)  
        Moderate: for a classical hire this is wrong, yet for unpaid interns or contractors it could be acceptable.  

   B3  Onboard_Employee can be repeated (Loop)  
        Minor: odd but not harmful; could model several onboarding sessions (IT-setup, legal briefing, etc.).  

   B4  Still no explicit “reject” branch (Decision always leads to onboarding); however, an implicit “reject” can be represented by deciding to skip Payroll and simply closing the case after onboarding.  

3.  Which model is closer to the normative process?  

   • The most critical business rule is that the hiring decision must be taken only after the candidate has been evaluated, i.e. after the interview(s).  
   • Model 1 violates this rule outright; nothing prevents Decide from happening before any interview is held.  
   • Model 2 always enforces “Interview  Decision”; although it lets Screening lag behind and makes Payroll optional, these deviations are either (i) less fundamental to the logic of “hire after evaluation” or (ii) still allow the correct path (the XOR branch that actually performs Payroll).  

   Therefore Model 2 is the better approximation of a standard Hire-to-Retire workflow.  

   Summary of anomaly severity (lower is better):  
   • Model 1: A1-Severe, A2-Medium   overall mis-alignment high.  
   • Model 2: B1-Moderate, B2-Moderate, B3-Minor   overall mis-alignment lower.  

   Consequently, Model 2 more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process, while Model 1 contains a fundamental flaw that undermines process correctness.
