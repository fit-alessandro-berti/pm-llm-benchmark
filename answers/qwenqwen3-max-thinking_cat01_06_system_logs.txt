### Explanation of Transformation Logic

#### **Case Identification**
Cases were defined based on **document-centric work sessions**. Each unique document (identified by application + filename) represents a distinct case, as user interactions typically revolve around completing a task related to that file. This aligns with common process mining practices in knowledge work, where a "case" corresponds to a unit of work (e.g., editing a report, replying to an email thread).

- **C001**: Work on `Quarterly_Report.docx` (initial open, later resumed, then closed).
- **C002**: Work on `Document1.docx` (drafting, saving, switching away, returning, finalizing, closing).
- **C003**: Email interaction (reading, replying, sending)—treated as a standalone case since it represents a complete communication task.
- **C004**: Review of `Report_Draft.pdf` (reading and annotating).
- **C005**: Editing `Budget_2024.xlsx` (data updates and saving).

The `SWITCH` events were used to **transition between cases**, not as activities within a case. For example, the switch from Word to Chrome ends the active Word case temporarily and begins the email case.

#### **Activity Naming**
Raw system actions were abstracted into **semantic, process-oriented activities**:
- `FOCUS` on a new document  **"Open Document"** (or **"Open Spreadsheet"/"Open PDF"** for clarity).
- `TYPING`  **"Draft Content"** (for documents) or **"Draft Email Response"** (in email context).
- `CLICK` on email actions  **"Read Email"**, **"Compose Reply"**, **"Send Email"**.
- `SCROLL`/`HIGHLIGHT` in PDF  **"Review Document"** and **"Annotate Document"**.
- `SAVE`  **"Save Document"** (or **"Save Spreadsheet"**).
- `CLOSE`  **"Close Document"**.
- `SWITCH` back to a previously opened document  **"Return to Document"** (to capture resumption of work).

This standardization ensures activities reflect **user intent** rather than low-level system events, making the log suitable for process discovery (e.g., identifying common paths like *Open  Draft  Save  Close*).

#### **Additional Attributes**
- **Application** and **Document/File** were retained as contextual attributes to support filtering or segmentation (e.g., comparing Word vs. Excel workflows).
- Timestamps were preserved exactly as provided.

This structure enables analysis of document lifecycles, multitasking patterns (e.g., interruptions via email), and efficiency metrics (e.g., time between draft and save).
