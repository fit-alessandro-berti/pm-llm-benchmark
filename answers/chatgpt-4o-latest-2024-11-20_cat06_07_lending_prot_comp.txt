To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to conduct a comparative analysis of the process variants, their frequencies, and their execution times. Using domain knowledge around loan application processes and fairness, here are the main differences:

---

### 1. **Frequency of Direct Rejection at Early Stages**
   - **Protected Group**:
     - "Request Appointment -> Appointment Denied" occurs **599 times** (frequency) with **90,000.623 ms** (performance).
     - "Request Appointment -> ... -> Application Rejected" occurs **960 times** with **219,999.156 ms**.
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - "Request Appointment -> Appointment Denied" occurs **363 times** with **80,001.088 ms**.
     - "Request Appointment -> ... -> Application Rejected" occurs **664 times** with **260,002.042 ms**.
   - **Difference**:
     - Rejections happen less frequently for the unprotected group (599 vs 363, and 960 vs 664).
     - Rejections for the unprotected group occur at slightly lower execution times, suggesting expedited processing compared to the protected group.

---

### 2. **Faster Loan Approvals for the Unprotected Group**
   - **Protected Group**:
     - "Request Appointment -> ... -> Sign Loan Agreement" variants occur at slower speeds, e.g., ~310,018 ms to ~390,019 ms.
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - Approval-related paths to "Sign Loan Agreement" similarly range around ~260,013 ms to ~440,103 ms, but **a unique variant explicitly skips collateral examination** ("Request Appointment -> ... -> skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement"), allowing **332 approvals** at just **260,013 ms**.
   - **Difference**:
     - The unprotected group benefits from skipped steps (specifically, collateral assessment), leading to faster and seemingly more streamlined access to signed loan agreements.
     - This shortcut is absent for the protected group.

---

### 3. **Increased Scrutiny for the Protected Group**
   - **Protected Group**:
     - There are a larger number of variants that include additional collateral assessments or co-signer requests. For example:
       - "Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement."
     - Multiple additional visits to assess collateral appear frequently (e.g., variants where "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" is repeated multiple times).
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - Far fewer attempts include multiple visits or repeated requests for a co-signer. When they do, they occur at **lower frequencies** (e.g., one variant with a frequency of 1 or as low as 7).
   - **Difference**:
     - The protected group undergoes heavier scrutiny, requiring repeated steps and intermediary assessments (e.g., co-signer, collateral).
     - The unprotected group experiences fewer steps toward decision-making.

---

### 4. **Loan Denial Frequency**
   - **Protected Group**:
     - "Loan Denied" outcomes occur prominently in **loan-related pathways**, such as:
       - "Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (**227 instances**, ~310,015 ms).
       - Variants with repeated collateral assessments ending in "Loan Denied" occur **frequently** (e.g., 104 times, 88 times, 40 times), sometimes as high as 390,055.423 ms in performance.
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - Denials are concentrated in straightforward paths:
       - "Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (**2,709 instances**, ~340,005 ms).
       - **Repeated collateral steps leading to denials** occur occasionally but at much lower frequencies (e.g., 23, 7, and 1).
   - **Difference**:
     - Loan denial processes for the protected group involve **excessive scrutiny and repeated steps**, such as multiple collateral assessments, which do not lead to approvals.
     - For the unprotected group, denials occur primarily through standard pathways, with limited recurrence of invasive intermediary steps.

---

### 5. **Execution Time Discrepancies**
   - **Protected Group**:
     - Execution times for approval/denial processes are **consistently high**, especially when additional steps (e.g., collateral assessments, co-signer requests) are introduced. Performance often ranges from ~310,018 ms to ~390,055 ms.
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - While execution times are also high, the introduction of skipped steps (e.g., skipped examination at ~260,013 ms) offers a significant efficiency advantage to some applications.
   - **Difference**:
     - The unprotected group benefits from streamlined decision-making pathways, while the protected group faces more delays caused by repeated assessments and additional demands.

---

### 6. **Approval-to-Denial Ratio**
   - **Protected Group**:
     - The frequency of pathways leading to "Sign Loan Agreement" is **extremely low** compared to denial pathways (e.g., ~31 approvals for "Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement," compared to hundreds of denials through invasive processes).
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - Approval pathways occur at **relatively high frequencies** compared to the protected group. For example:
       - "Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" (**1656 approvals** vs 2709 rejections).
   - **Difference**:
     - Approval is significantly harder for the protected group, which disproportionately experiences hurdles and denials.

---

### Summary of Main Differences:
1. Early-stage rejections are more common and slower for the protected group.
2. Loan approvals favor the unprotected group due to faster or skipped processes.
3. Protected group undergoes more invasive scrutiny (e.g., repeated collateral assessments).
4. Denials for the protected group involve more steps and delays compared to straightforward denial pathways for the unprotected group.
5. Execution times for loan approvals/denials are consistently higher for the protected group.
6. Approval rates (frequency of "Sign Loan Agreement") are far lower for the protected group compared to the unprotected group.

### Potential Unfairness Implications:
- The additional scrutiny, delays, and lower approval rates for the protected group suggest possible systematic bias or discrimination.
- Streamlined or bypassed steps for the unprotected group further exacerbate unequal treatment. 

These differences highlight serious fairness concerns that likely violate the principle of "equal treatment for comparable situations."
