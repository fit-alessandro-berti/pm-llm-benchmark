Here's the analysis of the provided event log based on the normative rules and desiderata:

**Analysis of Cases:**

**Case 1:**

* **Normative Violations:** None. Case 1 follows the strict sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. The ordering and conditional actions are correctly executed.
* **Desiderata Deviations:** None apparent from the provided log. The Credit Check happened within a short time frame (30 minutes) and Inform Applicant happened within 2 hours of the decision. There was no Follow-up Call, but this is a desideratum and not a violation.
* **Interpretation:** Case 1 represents ideal process execution according to the strict normative rules and appears to adhere to the desiderata where applicable.

**Case 2:**

* **Normative Violations:**
    * **Violation 1:** Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check. The rule states that "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment," and the log shows "Risk Assessment" at 2024-01-11 08:20 followed by "Credit Check" at 2024-01-11 09:00.
    * **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation occurred after a rejected loan decision. The rule states, "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case." The log shows "Loan Decision (Rejected)" at 2024-01-11 09:30 and "Finalize Documentation" at 2024-01-11 10:00.
* **Desiderata Deviations:** None apparent from the log.
* **Interpretation:** Case 2 exhibits significant violations of the normative rules. The incorrect order of the credit check and risk assessment indicates a fundamental breakdown in the required workflow. Performing documentation finalization after a rejection is explicitly forbidden and suggests a serious error or deliberate disregard for process rules.

**Case 3:**

* **Normative Violations:** None. The normative sequence and conditional actions are followed: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
* **Desiderata Deviations:**
    * **Deviation 1:** Credit Check happened more than 24 hours after the application was received. The application was received on 2024-01-12 at 09:00, and the Credit Check was performed on 2024-01-14 at 10:00, which is over two days later. This violates the recommended time window.
    * **Deviation 2:** Inform Applicant happened later than the recommended 48 hours after the loan decision. The Loan Decision was made on 2024-01-14 at 12:00, and the applicant was informed on 2024-01-16 at 15:00. This is over two days (more than 48 hours) later.
    * **Deviation 3:** There was no Follow-up Call to the applicant before closing the case. This is explicitly mentioned as a recommended best practice that was not followed.
* **Interpretation:** Case 3 adheres to all the strict normative rules, demonstrating compliance with the required process flow. However, it fails to meet several of the desiderata conditions. The delays in the credit check and informing the applicant suggest potential inefficiencies or resource constraints within the process, although these do not represent critical rule violations. The absence of a follow-up call is simply a missed opportunity to follow a recommended practice.

**Summary:**

* **Cases Violating Normative Rules:** **Case 2**
    * Reasons: Risk Assessment before Credit Check, Finalize Documentation after a rejected loan decision.
* **Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions:** **Case 3**
    * Deviations: Credit Check delayed beyond 24 hours, Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48 hours, no Follow-up Call.
    * Clarification: These are deviations from recommended best practices, not strict rule violations.

This analysis clearly distinguishes between fundamental process rule violations (Case 2) and deviations from desired but non-critical behaviors (Case 3). Case 1 represents a perfectly executed process according to both normative rules and observed desiderata.
