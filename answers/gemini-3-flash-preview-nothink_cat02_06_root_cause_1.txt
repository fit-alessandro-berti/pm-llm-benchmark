Based on an analysis of the provided event log, here is the performance evaluation of the "Customer Support Ticket Resolution" process.

### 1. Identification of Long-Duration Cases

First, we calculate the total lead time (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket") for each case:

*   **Case 103:** 1 hour 20 minutes (Fastest)
*   **Case 101:** 2 hours 15 minutes (Standard)
*   **Case 104:** 24 hours 10 minutes (**Long**)
*   **Case 102:** 25 hours 10 minutes (**Long**)
*   **Case 105:** 49 hours 5 minutes (**Significant Outlier**)

**Summary:** Cases **102, 104, and 105** are significantly longer than the others, with Case 105 taking more than double the time of the other delayed cases and nearly 40 times longer than the fastest case.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis of Performance Issues

By examining the intervals between activities, several patterns emerge that explain these delays:

#### A. The "Escalation Bottleneck" (Case 102 & 105)
The most significant delays occur when a ticket is moved from a Level-1 to a Level-2 agent.
*   **Case 105:** After being escalated at 10:00 on March 1st, the investigation didn't begin until 14:00 on March 2nd. This represents a **28-hour idle period** where the ticket sat in the Level-2 queue.
*   **Case 102:** There was a **2.5-hour wait** between escalation and investigation. 
*   **Insight:** The Level-2 team appears to be a major bottleneck, either due to understaffing or a high volume of complex tickets.

#### B. High Level-1 Wait Times (Case 104)
Even without escalation, Case 104 experienced a significant delay.
*   **Wait for Investigation:** There was a **3.5-hour gap** between "Assign to Level-1" (09:30) and "Investigate Issue" (13:00). 
*   **Insight:** Level-1 agents may be juggling too many tickets simultaneously, causing a delay in starting work once a ticket is assigned.

#### C. The "End-of-Day" Stall (Case 102, 104, & 105)
A recurring pattern is that tickets not resolved by early afternoon often roll over to the next business day.
*   **Case 104:** Investigation started at 13:00 on Day 1, but resolution didn't occur until 08:00 on Day 2.
*   **Case 102:** Investigation started at 14:00 on Day 1, but resolution occurred at 09:00 on Day 2.
*   **Insight:** There is a lack of "afternoon momentum." If a ticket isn't finished before a certain time, it sits idle overnight, adding 15+ hours to the cycle time.

### 3. Insights and Recommendations

#### Insight: Escalation is the "Death Zone" for SLAs
The data suggests that once a ticket is escalated, the resolution time moves from "hours" to "days." This suggests that the handoff process is "throw it over the wall" rather than an active transition.

#### Recommendations:

1.  **Level-2 Capacity Planning:** 
    *   The 28-hour wait in Case 105 is unacceptable for a support process. The organization should evaluate Level-2 staffing levels or implement a "Fast Track" for urgent escalations.
2.  **Level-1 Empowerment (Shift-Left):** 
    *   Analyze *why* 102 and 105 were escalated. If Level-1 agents are provided with better knowledge base tools or training, they might resolve these issues themselves, avoiding the Level-2 bottleneck entirely.
3.  **Active Queue Management:** 
    *   In Case 104, the 3.5-hour gap between assignment and investigation suggests the ticket was "claimed" but not worked on. Implementing a "Pull" system (where agents only take a ticket when they are ready to start) or setting a "Time-to-Start" KPI could reduce this idle time.
4.  **Handoff Synchronization:**
    *   To address the "End-of-Day" stall, implement a policy for afternoon handovers or "sundown" updates, ensuring that tickets started in the afternoon have a clear path to resolution before the close of business.
