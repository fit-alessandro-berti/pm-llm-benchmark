###  **Process Mining Event Log**

Below is the transformed event log, structured for process mining analysis. Each event represents a meaningful activity within a coherent case, derived from the raw system log.

| Case ID | Activity Name                   | Timestamp                  | Application           | Document/Context         |

###  **Explanation of Transformation Logic**

#### **1. Case Identification (Case ID)**
- **Case Definition**: A "case" is defined as **a distinct document editing session**. This is based on observing user focus shifts and document lifecycle (open  edit  save  close).
- Two primary cases were identified:
  - **DOC-001**: Centered around editing `Document1.docx`. Although the user switches apps, the workflow returns to `Document1.docx` after handling email, PDF, and Excel tasks—indicating these are supporting activities for the same document.
  - **DOC-002**: Begins when the user returns to `Quarterly_Report.docx` after closing `Document1.docx`. This is a separate editing session, likely a continuation of earlier work (noted by the initial `FOCUS` on it at 08:59, before switching to the new document).

>  **Why not one case?**  
> The initial focus on `Quarterly_Report.docx` at 08:59 was brief and immediately followed by creating a new document (`Document1.docx`). The user only returns to `Quarterly_Report.docx` after finishing `Document1.docx`, suggesting a task switch. This supports two separate cases.

#### **2. Activity Naming (Abstraction & Standardization)**
- Raw actions (e.g., `TYPING`, `CLICK`, `SCROLL`) were grouped into **semantically meaningful activities**:
  - `TYPING` in Word  **Edit Document Content**
  - `TYPING` in email + `Send Email`  **Reply to Email about Meeting**
  - `SCROLL` + `HIGHLIGHT` in PDF  **Review PDF Report** and **Highlight Key Findings** (separate for precision)
  - `TYPING` in Excel  **Update Budget Spreadsheet**
  - `SAVE`  **Save Document** (generalized across apps)
  - `CLOSE`  **Close Document**
- Activities like `SWITCH` and `FOCUS` were **not included as standalone events** unless they marked the beginning of a new case or a key context shift (e.g., resuming an old document).

#### **3. Temporal and Contextual Logic**
- The sequence from 09:00 to 09:07 revolves around `Document1.docx`: the user starts it, saves it, checks email (possibly for input), reviews a PDF (likely reference material), updates a budget (data source), and returns to update the document.
- This **supports a single case (DOC-001)** where auxiliary tasks (email, PDF, Excel) are part of the broader document creation process.
- At 09:07:15, the user re-opens `Quarterly_Report.docx` and performs a short editing session—treated as **DOC-002**, a separate case.

#### **4. Handling the Initial FOCUS at 08:59**
- The first event (focus on `Quarterly_Report.docx`) is **not included as a standalone activity** because no editing or saving occurs until later. It’s treated as a preparatory step or distraction.
- The actual **start of DOC-002** is marked when editing resumes at 09:07:45.

###  **Summary**
- **Two coherent cases** were identified based on document-centric work sessions.
- **Activities were abstracted** to meaningful business actions (e.g., “Edit”, “Review”, “Send”) suitable for process discovery.
- The log now tells a **clear narrative**:
  - User creates a new document, integrates data from email, PDF, and Excel, and finalizes it.
  - Then, switches to complete a previously started report.

This event log is ready for analysis in tools like **ProM**, **Celonis**, or **Disco**, enabling process discovery, conformance checking, and bottleneck detection.
