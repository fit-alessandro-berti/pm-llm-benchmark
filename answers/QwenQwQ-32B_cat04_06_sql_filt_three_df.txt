Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that excludes events from cases where certain criteria are met. The criteria involve a specific sequence of three activities followed by a timing condition.

First, I need to understand the requirements thoroughly. The problem has three main parts:

1. Identify cases with the exact sequence of three activities in a row: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed immediately by 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order'.
2. Among those cases, only consider those where the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days.
3. Exclude all events from those cases. The final result should include all events except those from such cases.

Hmm. So, the final output should be all events except those in cases that both have the specific sequence and meet the time condition. 

Let me break it down.

First, I need to find all case_ids that have the three activities in succession. How do I check for a consecutive sequence of events? One common approach is to self-join the table on case_id with an increment in the event order. Alternatively, since DuckDB has window functions and LAG/LEAD, maybe that's better here.

Wait, maybe using window functions with row or event order. Let me think.

Each case_id has a sequence of events ordered by timestamp. For each event in the case, I can look at the next activity and the one after that. For instance, using LEAD():

For example, for each row, look if the next activity is Create Order and the one after that is Confirm Order, provided that they are consecutive.

Alternatively, looking for each triplet in the sequence. Let me see.

Suppose for each row where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check if the next one is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order', and the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to first find all sequences of three consecutive events where the three activities are exactly in that order, and the time between second and third is over 5 days. Those are the ones we need to exclude.

Wait, but the problem requires first identifying cases that have this sequence, then among them, those with the timing, and exclude the entire case if they meet both. 

So the steps would be:

First, select all case_ids where the triplet exists in sequence and the time between Create and Confirm is >5 days. Then exclude all events belonging to these case_ids.

Therefore, the query can be constructed by first finding these case_ids with a subquery, then selecting everything except those case_ids.

So the structure would be:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id FROM ... the query that finds case_ids meeting the criteria ...
)

The main challenge is the subquery that finds the case ids. Let's focus on that.

How to detect the triplet in consecutive events?

One approach is to:

For each case, order the events by timestamp. For each activity, check if the next activity is the next in sequence, and the one after that is the next one.

Alternatively, for each row in the event log, consider the next two rows in the same case but subsequent in time. If the current activity is Approve, next is Create, next is Confirm, and the time between the Create and Confirm is over 5 days, then the case is to be excluded.

Hmm, perhaps using window functions and lead to look ahead.

Let me think of an approach with LAG/LEAD:

Suppose:

For each row in event_log, we can use three LEAD functions over a window ordered by timestamp for the case.

Wait, but LEAD is usually for looking one row ahead. To capture three rows in sequence, perhaps need to check the current and two next rows?

Alternatively, take each row and for each, look at the next two activities and check the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe for every triplet of consecutive events, check if their activities are the required sequence and their timing meets the condition. But how?

Maybe the following steps:

1. For each case, order the events by timestamp.

2. For each event that has the current activity as Approve Purchase Requisition, check if the next event in the same case is Create Order (within same case and immediately after), and then the next after that is Confirm Order. Also check the time between Create and Confirm.

Alternatively, process the events in triplets:

For a case, for each triplet of three events in order, check if their activities are exactly the sequence and the time between the second and third event is >5 days.

So for each triplet in a case:

First triplet events:

event1.activity = Approve

event2.activity = Create

event3.activity = Confirm

and event3.timestamp - event2.timestamp > 5 days.

If such a triplet exists in a case, then that case should be excluded.

So, how to structure this in SQL?

Perhaps using window functions to get the next activities and the time difference.

Let me try to write a query to find all such cases where there exists a triplet in a row like that.

First, for each row, let's look at the next activities:

First, window functions with partition by case_id order by timestamp.

We can add columns for next_activity_1 (the next activity after) and next_activity_2 (the one after that), along with their timestamps for the second and third steps.

Wait, but maybe first, the event in the first position (Approve) has the next event's activity, and then check if that next has the next again.

Alternatively:

In the same case, group events, and for each approverow, check next row is create and next after that is confirm, and the time between create and confirm is over 5 days.

Hmm.

Another idea:

Use LEAD to get the next activity and the one after:

SELECT *,
    LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_1,
    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_2,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp1,
    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp2
FROM event_log;

Then, for each row, if activity is "Approve...", and next_activity_1 is "Create...", and next_activity_2 is "Confirm...", and (next_timestamp2 - next_timestamp1) > 120 hours (since 120h = 5 days). Wait, but the time between the next two steps (Create and next, which is confirm):

Wait, the Create is next_activity_1's activity (second activity in triplet). So the time between the Create's timestamp and Confirm's timestamp would be next_timestamp2 (third event's timestamp) minus next_timestamp1 (second event's timestamp)?

Yes. So, the timediff between the second and third events is next_timestamp2 (third's TS) minus next_timestamp1 (second's TS).

So in this scenario, for each row where activity is "Approve Purchase Requisition", we can check if next_activity is "Create...", the second next is "Confirm...", and the timedifference between next_timestamp2 and next_timestamp1 is greater than 5 days. If any such row exists in a case, then the case is to be excluded.

However, rows in a triplet could be represented in three different rows. For example, the Approve row would have the next two, but the Create row would have the next activity as Confirm, but maybe that's not sufficient for the timing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to look for any such triplet in the case. Therefore, the existence of a row in the case where the activity is Approve, next is Create, next next is Confirm, and the required time between them qualifies the case as needing exclusion.

Therefore, in the query, we can use the derived columns from above.

Thus, the subquery for case_ids to exclude would be something like:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_a1,
    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_a2,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_t1,
    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_t2
  FROM event_log
) AS sub
WHERE 
  activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
  AND next_a1 = 'Create Order' 
  AND next_a2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND next_t2 - next_t1 > INTERVAL '5 days';

So, the subquery calculates for each row:

- activity (current activity)

- next_a1 is the activity of the next event in the case (after current event)

- next_a2 is the activity after next

Similarly, next_t1 and next_t2 are their timestamps.

The WHERE clause checks whether the current activity is the first in the triplet, and the next two are correct, and the time between the second and third (next_a2's timestamp is next_t2, and the second's is next_t1, so next_t2 - next_t1 must be >5 days.

Wait, but the time between next_t1 (the Create Order's timestamp) and next_t2 (Confirm's) - so (next_t2 - next_t1) should be over 5 days.

If any such row exists in a case, then that case is to be excluded.

So, the final subquery would return any case_id where there exists at least one such a row.

Therefore, the total cases to exclude are those case_ids.

Once we have that, the main query would be to select all rows where case_id is not in that subquery.

But need to make sure that the subquery does not miss any case. Because the triplet could exist but be detected in multiple rows. The DISTINCT is important to avoid duplicates.

Also, the subtraction of timestamps would depend on the interval calculation. Since it's DuckDB, the intervals can be added using INTERVAL '5 days'.

Wait, the problem states 'more than 5 days', so it's the CASE where (Confirm Order's time - Create Order's time) >5 days. So the next_t2 minus next_t1 is that difference. So the condition applies.

However, there's another potential issue here: Since the current activity is Approve, which is the first of the triplet, the corresponding next rows would give the Create (next) and Confirm (next after next). So when you find such a row, it's the start of the triplet, so the case should be excluded.

Therefore, this approach should work.

Now, putting it into the main query:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_a1,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_a2,
            LEAD("timestamp") OVER w AS next_t1,
            LEAD("timestamp", 2) OVER w AS next_t2
        FROM event_log
        WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp")
    ) 
    WHERE 
      activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
      AND next_a1 = 'Create Order' 
      AND next_a2 = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (next_t2 - next_t1) > INTERVAL '5 day'
);

Wait, the ordering in the window definition must ensure it's ordered by timestamp. Also, the activity is 'Approve...'

Wait, also need to quote the column names if timestamp is a reserved keyword. Hmm, the user says the column is called "timestamp", so perhaps in the table it's okay. Maybe using double quotes for CAse sensitivity.

Also, the system may have special meaning for TIMESTAMP, but since the user says it's a column, I must use quotes as needed.

Another thing: LEAD over the case_id partitioned by that.

Wait, the ORACLE syntax might be okay here.

Alternatively, perhaps the where clause can have some further conditions to make sure that next_a1 or next_a2 are not null? Because if those are the last rows in a case, the LEAD would return null, so the WHERE clause will filter those out automatically.

Yes, since the first activity after Approve would require two more steps for the next two activities to be set, so the only rows that can have next_a2 is the one where there are at least three events in case? No, actually, for the row that is Approve, if the case has only 3 events, then the next_a1 and next_a2 would be the next two.

But when the lead activities are checked, only if they are exactly Create then Confirm.

Thus, the inner query will not include rows where those lead activities are null.

Another thing: The interval subtraction. The difference between next_t2 and next_t1 should be more than 5 days. DuckDB will handle the interval subtraction, returning an interval, and then the >5 days condition is correct.

Alternatively, we can use interval_days function or extract days from it.

Alternatively, in some databases, you can do (next_t2 - next_t1) > interval '5 days', which is what we have here. So that should work in DuckDB.

Now, this should return all case_ids that have the triplet in sequence with the time condition.

Testing edge cases: 

If a case has the three activities but time between Create and Confirm is exactly 5 days, it shouldn't be selected. Similarly, if the activity order is correct but the time is less, that case is not excluded. Also, if the triplet appears multiple times in a case, but one of them meets the timing, then the case should be excluded.

Another possible edge case is where the triplet occurs but not consecutively. For example, between the first Approve and Create there is another activity. In that case, the LEAD would not capture as the next activity after the Approve is not Create, so it's fine.

Wait. The key is the triplet must be consecutive: after Approve comes Create and then Confirm, with no any other activity in between. So the algorithm checks exactly that by requiring the next_a1 to be Create, and the next_a2 to be Confirm, which implies they are the next immediate rows.

Thus, the query should work correctly.

Therefore, the final SQL would be as above, with the main query selecting everything where case_id is not in that subquery.

Another point: the TIMESTAMP column is a datetime, so subtracting them gives an interval, and comparing with INTERVAL '5 days' should be okay.

Wait, in DuckDB, how is the subtraction handled? For example, TIMESTAMP - TIMESTAMP returns an interval. Then, when comparing (next_t2 - next_t1) > interval '5 days', which is correct.

Yes. Let me check DuckDB documentation:

Yes, in DuckDB, you can subtract two timestamps to get an interval, and then compare with an interval literal.

So the code should be okay.

Wait one more thing: the subquery uses "timestamp" (the column name). In the query above, I used "timestamp" without quotes, but maybe in DuckDB it's okay. However, given that "TIMESTAMP" is a keyword in SQL, it's safer to enclose it in double quotes as "timestamp", especially if the actual column is named timestamp. So in the LEAD function:

LEAD("timestamp") OVER w ...

Yes, that's better.

So putting it all together:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "case_id"
    FROM (
        SELECT
            "case_id",
            "activity",
            LEAD("activity") OVER w AS next_a1,
            LEAD("activity", 2) OVER w AS next_a2,
            LEAD("timestamp") OVER w AS next_t1,
            LEAD("timestamp", 2) OVER w AS next_t2
        FROM event_log
        WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY "case_id" ORDER BY "timestamp" ASC)
    ) 
    WHERE 
        "activity" = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_a1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_a2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_t2 - next_t1) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

Wait, need to make sure about the ordering in the window. The window is ordered by "timestamp" ASC to ensure chronological order.

But since it's partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp, the LEAD is taken in the correct order.

Additionally, the outer DISTINCT "case_id" ensures that each case is only counted once even if multiple triplets exist or multiple occurrences in the same case.

Now, the final check is that the query must include all events except those where their case is in the subquery result.

This should work. Let me think of alternative approaches.

Alternatively, another approach using self joins:

First, for the triplet:

Find triplets in the same case where:

ev1.activity = 'Approve...', ev2.activity='Create...', ev3.activity='Confirm...', and the indices are consecutive (time between each is correct).

Wait, perhaps:

Find all cases where exists a triplet of events (e1, e2, e3) such that:

case_id of all three are same,

e1's activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition',

e2 is the next event after e1, and e2's activity is 'Create Order',

e3 is the next event after e2, and e3's activity is 'Confirm Order',

and the time between e2 and e3 is more than 5 days.

This would require joining the event_log three times for each case.

The subquery for case_ids to exclude could be:

SELECT e1.case_id
FROM event_log e1
JOIN event_log e2 ON e2.case_id = e1.case_id AND e2."timestamp" > e1."timestamp"
JOIN event_log e3 ON e3.case_id = e2.case_id AND e3."timestamp" > e2."timestamp"
WHERE 
e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
AND (e3."timestamp" - e2."timestamp") > INTERVAL '5 days'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    -- ensure there are no other events between e1 and e2
    SELECT 1 
    FROM event_log e 
    WHERE e.case_id = e1.case_id 
    AND e."timestamp" > e1."timestamp" 
    AND e."timestamp" < e2."timestamp"
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    -- ensure there are no other events between e2 and e3
    SELECT 1 
    FROM event_log e 
    WHERE e.case_id = e2.case_id 
    AND e."timestamp" > e2."timestamp" 
    AND e."timestamp" < e3."timestamp"
);

This approach is more complicated but ensures that there are no events in between. However, this is very involved because it requires checking for any intervening activities between the three. That adds the NOT EXISTS clauses for each pair of events.

The original approach with LEAD is better in that it implicitly requires that the next activities are the ones, which only happens if there are no intervening steps. Because the LEAD function jumps to the immediate next row. So if there's another event in between, e.g., another activity between the Approve and Create, then in that case, e1.activity would be Approve, but the LEAD would return that intervening activity's name instead of Create, so the triplet check would fail. Hence the first approach ensures there's no other events in between.

Therefore, the LEAD approach is sufficient and avoids the more complex joins.

Therefore, the initial query using window functions is correct.

Another test case: suppose a case has the following events in order:

Approve, Create, [sleep for 6 days], Confirm. So the triplet is consecutive (no other events between), and the time between Create and Confirm is 6 days. Then this case will be included in the exclusion list, so they are excluded from final result.

Yes.

Another test case where between Approve and Create is another activity. Then, the LEAD(activity) for the Approve row is that other activity, not Create, so the triplet won't be detected. So such a case won't be excluded.



Another possible issue: what if there is a case with the triplet but the timing is exactly 5 days? So, the exclusion is for >5. Hence, exactly 5 is not excluded. So the condition uses >5 days, which is correct.

Hmm, maybe the user intended to use 'more than' or 'at least', but as per problem statement, it's more than.

Yes, the query has (next_t2 - next_t1) > INTERVAL '5 days', which matches the requirement.

Okay. So I think the query should be correct.
</think>

Here's the SQL query to solve the problem:

```sql
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT sub.case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_a1,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_a2,
            LEAD("timestamp") OVER w AS next_t1,
            LEAD("timestamp", 2) OVER w AS next_t2
        FROM event_log
        WINDOW w AS (
            PARTITION BY case_id
            ORDER BY "timestamp"
        )
    ) sub
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_a1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_a2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_t2 - next_t1) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Window Functions**: The inner query uses `LEAD` to look ahead to the next two activities and their timestamps in each `case_id`. This allows us to check:
   - Next activity (`next_a1`) of the current one.
   - Activity two steps ahead (`next_a2`).
   - Timestamps for the next two steps (`next_t1` and `next_t2`). 

2. **Condition Check**: The `WHERE` clause in the inner query identifies rows where:
   - The current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'.
   - The next two activities are exactly 'Create Order' followed by 'Confirm Order'.
   - The time between `next_t2` (Confirm Order timestamp) and `next_t1` (Create Order timestamp) exceeds 5 days.

3. **Exclusion**: The outer query uses `NOT IN` to exclude all events from cases (`case_id`) meeting the above criteria. This ensures **only cases** that **do not have the specific sequence and timing** are returned.

This approach efficiently identifies target cases using window functions, ensuring that triplets are consecutive and meet timing constraints while avoiding complex joins or filtering for intermediate events.
