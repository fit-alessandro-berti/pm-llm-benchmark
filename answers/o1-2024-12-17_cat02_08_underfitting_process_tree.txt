**Example of an Improperly Allowed Trace:**

```
Receive_Order → Check_Inventory → Ship_Order → Authorize_Payment → Package_Items → Close_Order
```

**Why This Trace Is Problematic:**

According to the standard Order-to-Cash logic, if the order proceeds successfully (i.e., inventory is sufficient), the sequence of steps should follow a logical business order:

1. **Authorize Payment** before you commit resources (e.g., packaging) or ship the product.
2. **Package Items** after the order is approved and payment is secured.
3. **Ship Order** only after payment is authorized and the items are packaged.
4. Finally, **Close Order** once the shipping process is complete.

In the domain, it would never make sense to ship the items before confirming that the customer has paid. However, the given process tree uses a parallel operator (`Operator.PARALLEL`) for `Authorize_Payment`, `Package_Items`, and `Ship_Order`. This parallel structure allows these three activities to occur in **any order**. As a result, the model would consider the sequence:

- **Ship_Order** before **Authorize_Payment** and **Package_Items**

as a valid execution path, even though it is entirely inconsistent with normal business operations. By domain standards, you must secure payment first, prepare the shipment, and only then send out the goods.

In other words, the model “underfits” the desired constraints by not enforcing the logical dependency that `Ship_Order` should only happen after `Authorize_Payment` and `Package_Items`. This leads to traces that are valid per the model’s syntax, but clearly invalid in the real-world Order-to-Cash context.
