To identify inconsistencies, we need to check for the following anomalies in the `order_event_log`:

1. **Missing Credit Check before Shipment**: Perform Credit Check must precede Shipment Confirmation and Shipment.
2. **Celery Medal before Shipment**: Shipment Confirmation should come before Shipment.
3. **Invalid Payment Order**: Payment must follow Invoice issuance.

The SQL queries to detect these issues are as follows:

```sql
-- 1. Cases without Credit Check before Ship Goods or Confirm Shipment
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM order_event_log o
WHERE o.activity IN ('Ship Goods', 'Confirm Shipment')
  AND COALESCE(
      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log ce 
       WHERE ce.case_id = o.case_id 
         AND ce.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
         AND ce.timestamp < o.timestamp), 0) = 0;

-- 2. Ship Goods without prior Confirm Shipment
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM order_event_log o
WHERE o.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND COALESCE(
      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log ce 
       WHERE ce.case_id = o.case_id 
         AND ce.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
         AND ce.timestamp < o.timestamp), 0) = 0;

-- 3. Payment before Issue Invoice
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM order_event_log o
WHERE o.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND COALESCE(
      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log ie 
       WHERE ie.case_id = o.case_id 
         AND ie.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
         AND ie.timestamp < o.timestamp), 0) = 0;

-- 4. Complete process only in proper order
SELECT o.case_id, o.activity, o.timestamp
FROM order_event_log o
WHERE 
    o.activity = 'Register Order' AND
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log ce WHERE ce.case_id = o.case_id AND ce.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND ce.timestamp > o.timestamp) > 0
  OR 
    o.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log se WHERE se.case_id = o.case_id AND se.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND se.timestamp > o.timestamp) > 0
  OR 
    o.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log cse WHERE cse.case_id = o.case_id AND cse.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND cse.timestamp > o.timestamp) > 0
  OR 
    o.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log sse WHERE sse.case_id = o.case_id AND sse.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND sse.timestamp > o.timestamp) > 0
  OR 
    o.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log ike WHERE ike.case_id = o.case_id AND ike.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND ike.timestamp > o.timestamp) > 0
  OR 
    o.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log re WHERE re.case_id = o.case_id AND re.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND re.timestamp > o.timestamp) > 0
  OR 
    o.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_event_log ike WHERE ike.case_id = o.case_id AND ike.activity = 'IssueInvoice' AND ike.timestamp < o.timestamp) = 0;
```

**Key Rationale:**

1. **Credit Checkelsement** is critical because a valid credit check is mandatory before any Shipment steps. The first query finds Ship Goods events without preceding credit checks.
2. **Confirm Shipment** via Logistics is required before **Ship Goods** can occur in the timestamp sequence, ensuring inventory availability.
3. **Payment cannot precede Invoice**, as per financial regulations. The third query flags payments before invoices.

These queries provide an audit trail for OE, enabling targeted investigations into logistics bottlenecks, policy violations (like late shipments), and payment processing failures. For each anomaly detected, cross-referencing with the `orders` table (e.g., `order_value` inconsistency) and `resources` table (e.g., role assignments) can further diagnose root causes.
