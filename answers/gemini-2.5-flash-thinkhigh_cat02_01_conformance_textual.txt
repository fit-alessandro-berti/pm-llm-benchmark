To identify violations, we will analyze each case against the normative process description, paying close attention to sequence, preconditions, and conditional branching.

**Normative Process Rules Derived:**

1.  **Start:** All cases must begin with "Receive order".
2.  **Initial Check:** "Check inventory" must occur after "Receive order" and *before* "Authorize payment" or "Package items".
3.  **Successful Fulfillment Path (Sufficient Inventory):**
    *   Sequence: `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order`.
    *   Preconditions:
        *   `Authorize payment` must be *after* `Check inventory`.
        *   `Package items` must be *after* `Authorize payment`.
        *   `Ship order` must be *after* `Package items`.
4.  **Cancellation Path (Insufficient Inventory):**
    *   Sequence: `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order`.
    *   Preconditions:
        *   If `Check inventory` reveals insufficient stock, the process must *directly* proceed to `Cancel order`.
        *   Activities intended for fulfillment (`Authorize payment`, `Package items`, `Ship order`) must *not* occur after `Cancel order`, nor should they occur if the inventory is insufficient (implying the cancellation path).
5.  **End:** `Close order` must be the final activity in all scenarios.
6.  **Explicit Violations Cited in Description:** "shipping after cancellation, authorizing payment before checking inventory, or packaging items before authorization."

**Analysis of Event Log Cases:**

**Case 1:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order". (Rule 1: OK)
    *   "Check inventory" occurs after "Receive order" and before "Authorize payment" or "Package items". (Rule 2: OK)
    *   The sequence perfectly matches the "Successful Fulfillment Path" (Rule 3: OK). Each step follows its prerequisite: Authorize after Check, Package after Authorize, Ship after Package, Close as final. (Rule 3.a, 3.b, 3.c, 5: OK)
*   **Verdict:** **Conforms** to the normative process.

**Case 2:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order" and "Check inventory" is in place. (Rules 1, 2: OK)
    *   "Package items" occurs at 10:00, but "Authorize payment" occurs later at 10:30.
    *   **Violation:** The normative description explicitly states, "Package items should only occur after authorization," and "packaging items before authorization—would be considered a violation of the normative process." (Rule 3.b)
*   **Verdict:** **Violates** the normative process.

**Case 3:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order" and "Check inventory" is in place. (Rules 1, 2: OK)
    *   After "Check inventory," the process includes "Authorize payment" (09:40) followed by "Cancel order" (10:00). This indicates that the "Check inventory" likely revealed insufficient stock, leading to cancellation.
    *   **Violation 1:** If inventory was insufficient (implied by the `Cancel order` activity), the process should "directly proceed to 'Cancel order'" after "Check inventory." The "Authorize payment" step at 09:40 is inappropriate for an insufficient inventory scenario. The description states "payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known," implying it should not occur if inventory is insufficient. (Rule 4)
    *   **Violation 2:** The "Ship order" activity occurs at 10:30 *after* "Cancel order" at 10:00. The normative description clearly states: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping), and thus the next reasonable step is to "Close order."" It further states that "Ship order should ... never after a cancellation," and explicitly lists "shipping after cancellation" as a violation. (Rule 4.b, 6)
*   **Verdict:** **Violates** the normative process in multiple ways.

**Case 4:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order". (Rule 1: OK)
    *   "Check inventory" occurs after "Receive order". (Rule 2: OK)
    *   The sequence directly proceeds to "Cancel order" after "Check inventory", followed by "Close order". This perfectly matches the "Cancellation Path" for insufficient inventory. No fulfillment activities occur after cancellation. (Rule 4, 5: OK)
*   **Verdict:** **Conforms** to the normative process.

**Case 5:**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Starts with "Receive order" and "Check inventory" is in place. (Rules 1, 2: OK)
    *   After "Authorize payment," the process directly goes to "Ship order".
    *   **Violation:** The "Package items" activity is entirely skipped. The normative description states: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as "Package items." Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with "Ship order."" This makes "Package items" a mandatory prerequisite for "Ship order" in the successful fulfillment path. (Rule 3.c)
*   **Verdict:** **Violates** the normative process.

**Summary of Violations:**

*   **Case 2:** Violates the sequence for successful fulfillment. "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment," which is explicitly stated as a violation ("packaging items before authorization").
*   **Case 3:** Violates two core principles:
    1.  **Incorrect Branching:** "Authorize payment" occurs after "Check inventory" when the process subsequently leads to "Cancel order." If inventory is insufficient, the process should directly cancel, not authorize payment.
    2.  **Shipping After Cancellation:** "Ship order" occurs *after* "Cancel order," which is explicitly forbidden ("Ship order should ... never after a cancellation" and "shipping after cancellation" is listed as a violation).
*   **Case 5:** Violates the sequence for successful fulfillment by skipping a mandatory step. "Ship order" occurs *before* "Package items," when the normative description clearly states that items must be "properly packaged" before shipping.
