Looking at the event logs against the normative process description, I need to identify cases that violate the established rules.

Let me first summarize the normative process rules:
1. **Receive order**  **Check inventory**  **Authorize payment**  **Package items**  **Ship order**  **Close order** (for sufficient inventory)
2. **Receive order**  **Check inventory**  **Cancel order**  **Close order** (for insufficient inventory)
3. **Authorize payment** must come AFTER **Check inventory**
4. **Package items** must come AFTER **Authorize payment**
5. **Ship order** must come AFTER **Package items**
6. **Cancel order** cannot be followed by **Ship order**
7. **Close order** must be the final activity in all cases

Now, let's analyze each case:

**Case 1**: Timeline: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close
- This follows the correct sequence for sufficient inventory
- **No violation**

**Case 2**: Timeline: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close
- **Package (10:00)** occurs BEFORE **Authorize payment (10:30)**
- This violates Rule 4: "Package items should only occur after authorization"
- **Violation: Package before authorization**

**Case 3**: Timeline: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close
- **Cancel order (10:00)** occurs AFTER **Authorize payment (09:40)**
- This violates Rule 6: "Ship order should never occur after a cancellation"
- **Violation: Ship after cancellation**

**Case 4**: Timeline: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close
- This follows the correct sequence for insufficient inventory
- **No violation**

**Case 5**: Timeline: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close
- This is missing **Package items** between authorization and shipping
- This violates Rule 5: "Ship order should only occur after packaging"
- **Violation: Skip package step**

## Summary of Violations:

1. **Case 2**: **Package items occurs before Authorize payment** - Direct violation of the sequence rule
2. **Case 3**: **Ship order occurs after Cancel order** - Violation of the no-shipping-after-cancellation rule
3. **Case 5**: **Missing Package items before Ship order** - Violation of the package-then-ship rule

These three cases represent deviations from the normative process. Cases 1 and 4 follow the intended flow correctly.
