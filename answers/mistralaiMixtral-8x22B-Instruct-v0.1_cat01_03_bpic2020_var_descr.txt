 The data represents a business process involving a declaration submitted by an employee. The process has several variants, with the most common one involving the following steps:
1. Declaration is submitted by the employee.
2. Declaration is approved by the administration.
3. The declaration is approved by the budget owner ( variant 2 only).
4. The declaration is approved by the supervisor (final approval).
5. A request for payment is made.
6. The payment is handled.

There are also cases where the declaration is saved but not submitted, and other scenarios where the declaration is rejected at various points in the process. The declaration can be rejected by the administration, budget owner, supervisor, pre-approver or due to a missing approver. When the declaration is rejected, it is typically sent back to the employee for revision and resubmission. In some cases, the process may involve multiple rejections before final approval. The duration and cost (performance) of each process variant varies.
