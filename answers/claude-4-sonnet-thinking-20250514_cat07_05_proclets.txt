This visualization shows a comprehensive business process model for a laboratory testing system with three main components:

**(a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels:**
This is the main workflow diagram showing the complete lab testing process. It's divided into two main sections:

- **Left side (Lab visit):** Shows the patient-facing workflow including doctor consultation, order entry, blood sample collection by lab assistant, result reception, result judgment, and report sending
- **Right side (Lab test):** Shows the laboratory workflow including order system processing, test performance by chemical analysts, report generation, and test completion

The two sides are connected through numbered channels (1.1, 1.2, etc.) showing how information flows between the lab visit and lab test processes. Black circles indicate start/end points of the workflows.

**(b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes:**
This shows the simplified relationship between the two main process classes - "Lab visit" and "Lab test" - with a "requires 1..1" relationship, indicating that each lab visit requires exactly one lab test.

**(c) Example of a performative:**
This table demonstrates how communication occurs between the processes, showing a specific example at 11:00 where the Order system sends a request from "Lab visit - HGB John" to "Lab test - HGB John" to create an HGB test, with the message "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"

Overall, this appears to be a proclet-based business process model that illustrates how laboratory testing workflows are structured and how different process instances communicate with each other.
