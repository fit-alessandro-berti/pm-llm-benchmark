Here is a BPMN-like textual process model derived from the provided interview excerpts:

**Process Model: Invoice Approval Workflow**

**Roles Involved:**
*   Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk
*   Purchasing Department
*   Department Manager
*   Accounts Payable (AP) Supervisor
*   Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)
*   Supplier

**Process Flow:**

*   **Start Event:** Invoice Received (typically via email)

*   **Task 1: Check for PO Number**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The clerk verifies if the incoming invoice is associated with a Purchase Order (PO) number.
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive - PO Check):**
        *   **Condition [No PO Number]:**
            *   **Task 1a: Request PO from Supplier**
                *   **Role:** AP Clerk
                *   **Description:** The clerk contacts the supplier to request the missing PO number and any other required details.
            *   **Task 1b: Provide PO to AP**
                *   **Role:** Supplier
                *   **Description:** The supplier sends the PO number and potentially a corrected invoice to Accounts Payable.
            *   *(Flow returns to Task 1: Check for PO Number)*
        *   **Condition [PO Number Present]:**
            *   *(Proceed to Task 2)*

*   **Task 2: Log Invoice & Request Receipt Confirmation**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The invoice is logged into the accounting system. The clerk then requests confirmation from the Purchasing Department regarding the receipt of goods or services related to the PO.

*   **Task 3: Verify Goods/Services Receipt & PO Match**
    *   **Role:** Purchasing Department
    *   **Description:** Purchasing verifies that the goods or services ordered against the PO have been received. They compare the invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) with the PO.
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive - Purchasing Verification):**
        *   **Condition [Discrepancy or No Receipt]:**
            *   *(Proceed to Exception Path A: Discrepancy Resolution)*
        *   **Condition [Receipt Confirmed & Matches PO]:**
            *   *(Proceed to Task 4)*

*   **Task 4: System Match Invoice Line Items**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The clerk uses the accounting system to perform a detailed match of the invoice line items against the PO.
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive - System Match):**
        *   **Condition [System Match Fails / Discrepancy Found]:**
            *   *(Proceed to Exception Path A: Discrepancy Resolution)*
        *   **Condition [System Match Successful]:**
            *   *(Proceed to Task 5)*

*   **Task 5: Request Manager Approval**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The AP Clerk notifies the Department Manager for final approval. This typically involves an automatic system notification (e.g., email).

*   **Task 6: Review Invoice for Approval**
    *   **Role:** Department Manager
    *   **Description:** The manager reviews the invoice details, PO, and confirmation data for accuracy, budget compliance, and any suspicious items.
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive - Manager Decision):**
        *   **Condition [Manager Rejects or Flags for Investigation]:**
            *   *(Proceed to Exception Path A: Discrepancy Resolution)*
        *   **Condition [Manager Approves]:**
            *   *(Proceed to Task 7)*

*   **Task 7: Schedule Payment**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The approved invoice is added to the payment schedule or run for processing.

*   **End Event:** Invoice Processed for Payment.

**Exception Path A: Discrepancy Resolution**
*(This path is triggered by a 'Discrepancy or No Receipt' outcome from the Task 3 Gateway, a 'System Match Fails' outcome from the Task 4 Gateway, or a 'Manager Rejects or Flags for Investigation' outcome from the Task 6 Gateway)*

*   **Task A1: Identify & Document Issue**
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk / Purchasing
    *   **Description:** The specific discrepancy (e.g., pricing error, quantity mismatch, missing item, rejection reason) is identified and documented. This might involve communication between AP and Purchasing.

*   **Gateway (Exclusive - Issue Type & Resolution Path):**
    *   **Condition [Simple Discrepancy / Missing Information]:**
        *   **Task A2: Contact Supplier for Correction**
            *   **Role:** SRM / Purchasing / AP Clerk
            *   **Description:** The relevant party (SRM, Purchasing, or AP Clerk) liaises with the supplier to resolve pricing, terms, quantities, or obtain missing information.
        *   **Task A3: Receive/Process Correction**
            *   **Role:** AP Clerk / Purchasing
            *   **Description:** Update the invoice in the accounting system or process the corrected version received from the supplier.
        *   *(Flow returns to Task 4: System Match Invoice Line Items for re-verification)*
    *   **Condition [Complex Issue / Unresolved Discrepancy / Requires Inter-departmental Coordination]:**
        *   **Task A4: Escalate Invoice Issue**
            *   **Role:** AP Clerk
            *   **Description:** Unresolved or complex issues are escalated to the AP Supervisor.

            *   **Role:** AP Supervisor
            *   **Description:** The AP Supervisor mediates between relevant departments (AP, Purchasing, potentially others) and/or the supplier to find a resolution. This may involve creating retrospective POs for informal services if required.
        *   *(After resolution by AP Supervisor, flow returns to Task 4: System Match Invoice Line Items for re-verification)*
