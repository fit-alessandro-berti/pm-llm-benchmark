**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

- **Case 2** violates **two normative rules**:  
  - **Violation 1:** *Risk Assessment* is performed before *Credit Check* (2024-01-11 08:20). The strict sequence requires *Credit Check  Risk Assessment*.  
  - **Violation 2:** *Finalize Documentation* is executed after a *Loan Decision (Rejected)* (2024-01-11 10:00). Documentation finalization is prohibited for rejected applications.  
  - **Severity:** These are critical violations of the mandatory process flow.  

**2. Desiderata Failures (Suboptimal Behavior):**  

- **Case 1**:  
  - **Desideratum Violation:** No *Follow-up Call* is performed before closing the case.  
  - **Explanation:** While the normative rules are satisfied, the absence of a follow-up call deviates from recommended best practices.  

- **Case 3**:  
  - **Desideratum Violation 1:** *Credit Check* occurs more than 24 hours after *Application Received* (2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00 = ~49 hours).  
  - **Desideratum Violation 2:** *Inform Applicant* occurs more than 48 hours after *Loan Decision* (2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00 = ~51 hours).  
  - **Desideratum Violation 3:** No *Follow-up Call* is performed.  
  - **Explanation:** These timing delays and lack of follow-up are not severe but reflect suboptimal adherence to recommendations.  

**3. Possible Interpretations/Justifications:**  

- **Case 2**:  
  - The reversed *Risk Assessment* and *Credit Check* could stem from a logging error (e.g., swapped timestamps) or a procedural mistake (e.g., an employee skipping a step).  
  - *Finalize Documentation* after rejection might indicate a system bug or human oversight (e.g., an automated trigger misfiring).  

- **Case 3**:  
  - Delays in *Credit Check* and *Inform Applicant* could result from high workload, technical issues, or prioritization of other cases.  
  - The missing *Follow-up Call* might reflect resource constraints or a deliberate choice to deprioritize non-mandatory steps.  

**Summary:**  
- **Critical Violations:** Only **Case 2** breaches strict normative rules.  
- **Desiderata Issues:** **Cases 1 and 3** deviate from recommendations but remain compliant with hard constraints.  
- **Root Causes:** Violations in Case 2 likely indicate process failures, while desiderata issues in Cases 1 and 3 suggest operational inefficiencies.
