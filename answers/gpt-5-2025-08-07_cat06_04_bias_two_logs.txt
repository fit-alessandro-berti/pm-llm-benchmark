Short answer: The bias shows up in Group B’s processing. A “Community Boost” (+10 ScoreAdjustment) is applied only when LocalResident = TRUE and CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club, which none of Group A’s cases have. This raises Group B applicants’ effective scores (and lowers their effective decision threshold), producing approvals at lower raw scores than comparable Group A cases.

How it manifests:
- Unequal access to ScoreAdjustment
  - Group A: ScoreAdjustment = 0 for all cases.
  - Group B: 2 of 3 cases receive +10 “Community Boost” tied to LocalResident = TRUE and specific CommunityGroup membership.
- Different effective thresholds
  - Group A: 720 approved; 710 rejected  implied cutoff around 715–720 without any boost.
  - Group B: U003 has 695 prelim but is approved after +10  705 adjusted, while Group A’s 710 was rejected. That indicates a lower effective cutoff for community members.
- Outcome patterns not explained by raw score alone
  - Average preliminary score of approved cases:
    - Group A: (720, 740)  730 average.
    - Group B: (720, 695)  707.5 average.
  - So Group B gets approvals at substantially lower raw scores due to the boost.
- Attribute influence
  - LocalResident: All Group B are TRUE; all Group A are FALSE. The boost appears contingent on being a local and in a specific CommunityGroup, so only Group B benefits.
  - CommunityGroup: Membership triggers the +10. None of Group A are members; two Group B cases are members and both are approved.
- Counterfactual check
  - If P002 (710) had received the same +10 adjustment, it would likely meet the effective threshold (720) and be approved. The absence of this adjustment is decisive for Group A outcomes.

Why this leads to systematic differences:
- The policy embeds favorable treatment for LocalResident + specific CommunityGroup, which in these logs aligns with the unprotected group (Group B) and is unavailable to the protected group (Group A). That creates disparate treatment (explicit rule using CommunityGroup) and disparate impact (protected group faces a higher effective bar), even when underlying preliminary scores are similar or higher.
