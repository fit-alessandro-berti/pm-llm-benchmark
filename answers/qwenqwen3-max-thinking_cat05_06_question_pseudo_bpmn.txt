1. What strategic rationale justifies sourcing critical components from four distinct geopolitical regions, and how does this affect supply chain resilience?  
2. How does the parallel execution of component procurement impact overall lead time, and could sequencing some tasks reduce inventory holding costs?  
3. In the event of a geopolitical disruption (e.g., trade sanctions or port closures), which component supply line poses the highest risk, and what contingency plans exist?  
4. Why is assembly centralized in Malaysia despite globally distributed component sources—could nearshoring or regional assembly hubs improve responsiveness?  
5. How is the “24/7 Operation” for assembly balanced against labor regulations, sustainability goals, and employee well-being in Malaysia?  
6. What criteria determine whether a failed unit undergoes rework versus being scrapped, and how are these thresholds optimized for cost and quality?  
7. Could real-time quality diagnostics during assembly reduce the volume of post-assembly failures and rework cycles?  
8. What factors drive the decision to split distribution between air freight and cargo shipping—cost, speed, carbon footprint, or market urgency?  
9. How does customs clearance variability across destination regions influence delivery reliability and customer satisfaction?  
10. Are regional distribution centers standardized in capability and inventory policy, or tailored to local market dynamics—and what are the trade-offs?  
11. How does the process accommodate sudden spikes in demand (e.g., product launches or viral trends) without overburdening assembly or logistics?  
12. What data sources and forecasting models inform the “Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast” task, and how frequently are they updated?  
13. How is communication coordinated among R&D, procurement, logistics, and sales teams when demand signals trigger supplier order adjustments?  
14. Could blockchain or IoT tracking enhance visibility across this multi-continent supply chain, particularly during component transit and customs?  
15. What environmental and ethical considerations are embedded in supplier selection beyond cost and lead time (e.g., conflict minerals, labor practices)?  
16. How does the exclusive gateway after quality checks handle borderline cases—where units partially pass—and who makes the final call?  
17. To what extent do local warehousing strategies account for reverse logistics (e.g., returns, repairs, recycling) in each region?  
18. Are there feedback loops from regional distribution centers back to R&D or procurement to inform future design or sourcing decisions?  
19. How is performance measured across this end-to-end process—throughput time, on-time delivery, cost per unit, sustainability metrics, or a balanced scorecard?  
20. If a new high-demand market emerges (e.g., Africa or Southeast Asia), how modular and scalable is this process to accommodate it without major redesign?
