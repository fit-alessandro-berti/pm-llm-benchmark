The pseudoBPMN you’ve sketched describes a fairly typical requesthandling process with branching and merging depending on what the customer has asked for.

At a high level it starts with a “Receive Customer Request” step and immediately asks, via an exclusiveOR gateway, what type of request it is:

- If it’s a standard request, the process follows the “standard” branch. The request is put through a standard validation task and then, because there are two independent checks to perform, an ANDsplit gateway launches a credit check and an inventory check in parallel. Once both of those have completed, an ANDjoin waits for them and then the process moves on to calculate a delivery date based on the validation and the check results.

- If it’s a custom request, the process takes a different branch. Instead of the standard validation and stock/credit checks, it goes to a custom feasibility analysis. An XOR gateway asks “Is customization feasible?”. A “yes” leads to preparing a custom quotation; a “no” leads to sending a rejection notice and, in that case, the process ends early.

Whichever branch you’ve taken, once the standard path’s delivery date is calculated or the custom path’s quotation is prepared, the flows come back together at the point labelled “After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed” and a decision is made about governance:

- An XOR gateway asks “Is approval needed?”. Depending on your business rules that might depend on order value, customer status, the degree of customization, etc. If no approval is required, you go straight to generating the final invoice.

- If approval is required, a manager reviews the case. A second XOR gateway tests “Is approval granted?”. If the approval is granted, you proceed to generate the final invoice. If approval is denied, the process does not end: a “Reevaluate conditions” task is triggered, and from there you loop back to the appropriate earlier step to adjust the offer – for a custom request you would revisit preparing the custom quotation (E1), for a standard request you would revisit the delivery calculation (D). The idea is to modify terms or conditions to satisfy the approver and resubmit.

Once the invoice has been generated, the final common step is to send a confirmation to the customer, after which the process terminates at the end event.

The gateways in your notation are what control the routing:

- XOR (exclusive) gateways such as “Check Request Type”, “Is Customization Feasible?”, “Is Approval Needed?” and “Is Approval Granted?” mean that exactly one outgoing path is taken based on the condition.

- The AND gateway “Run Parallel Checks” means both of its outgoing paths are taken concurrently, and the corresponding join waits for both to finish before proceeding.

The loop back from “Reevaluate conditions” to either Task E1 or Task D is what introduces a rework cycle when approval is not granted.
