The diagram is a type of Sankey diagram, which visualizes the flow of data over time, specifically focusing on the progression of fines through different stages. The horizontal axis represents time, spanning from 2000 to 2013, while the vertical axis categorizes the stages of fine processing: "Send Fine," 'Insert Fine Notification,' and 'Send for Credit Collection.' Each vertical line represents an individual fine, with the lines transitioning between stages over time. The diagram shows that all fines start at the 'Send Fine' stage, then move to the 'Insert Fine Notification' stage, and finally to the 'Send for Credit Collection' stage. The varying widths of the lines indicate the number of fines at each stage, with thicker lines representing more fines. The transitions between stages are depicted by the connections between the lines, highlighting the flow and progression of fines through the system. The overall concept illustrates the lifecycle of fines, showing how they are processed and moved through different stages over time.
