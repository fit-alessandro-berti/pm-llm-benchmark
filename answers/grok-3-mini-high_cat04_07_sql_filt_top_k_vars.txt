<think>
First, I need to construct a DuckDB SQL query. The event log is in a table called `event_log` with columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. A process variant is the ordered sequence of activities for each case, sorted by timestamp.

Step 1: Determine the sequence of activities for each case_id, ordered by timestamp.

I can use window functions or group by case_id and order by timestamp to get the sequence. In SQL, to get the ordered sequence, I might need to use ROW_NUMBER() or something similar to assign an order to each activity within a case.

To group by the sequence, I need to create a string or some representation of the ordered sequence. A common way is to concatenate the activities in order, separated by some delimiter, like '->' or something.

For each case_id, I need to get a string that represents the sequence, e.g., 'A->B->C'.

In DuckDB, which is based on SQLite but with more features, I can use STRING_AGG with ORDER BY.

DuckDB supports STRING_AGG with ORDER BY clause.

So, I can do something like:

SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

FROM event_log

GROUP BY case_id;

STRING_AGG can take an ORDER BY clause in some SQL dialects. I need to confirm for DuckDB.

Assuming DuckDB supports STRING_AGG with ORDER BY, like in PostgreSQL.

I can use a subquery to assign a row number.

But STRING_AGG with ORDER BY should work.

Let me assume it does for now.

So, first part: get the variant sequence per case.

Query:

SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

FROM event_log

GROUP BY case_id;

This should give me each case_id and its variant sequence as a string.

Step 2: Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants and count how many cases have each variant.

So, now I need to group by variant_sequence and count the number of case_id.

So, I can wrap this in another query:

SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(case_id) AS variant_count

FROM (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

) AS subquery

GROUP BY variant_sequence

ORDER BY variant_count DESC;

I need the top K variants by frequency.

So, I should limit to top K.

But I need to identify which cases are in the top K variants.

First, find the top K variants with their counts.

Then, for those variants, find the case_ids that have those variants.

Then, use those case_ids to filter the original event log.

The output should be all events from cases that are part of the top K variants.

So, I need to filter case_ids that belong to the top K variants.

Step 3: Determine top K variants.

I need to select the top K rows from the group by variant_sequence and count.

In SQL, to get top K, I can use LIMIT K, but I need to order by count desc.

If there are ties, it might not be specified, but probably we can just use LIMIT K after ORDER BY.

The prompt doesn't specify how to handle ties, so I'll assume simple top K by frequency.

Step 4: Then, for those top K variants, get the case_ids, and then select all events where case_id is in that set.

In SQL, to do this efficiently, I might want to use a subquery or CTE.

DuckDB supports Common Table Expressions (CTEs), I believe.

So, I can use WITH clauses.

Let me outline the steps in SQL.

First, create a CTE or subquery to get the variant sequence per case.

Second, get the count per variant sequence, ordered and limited to top K.

When I limit to top K variants, I get the variant_sequences, but I need the case_ids associated.

Better to first find all variant_sequences and their counts, rank them, then select the top K, then join back to get case_ids.

Since I need the variant_sequences of top K, I can select those variant_sequences, then find case_ids where the variant_sequence is in that list.

Variant_sequence is a string, so it should be fine.

Plan:

- CTE1: Get variant per case.

WITH variant_per_case AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

)

- Then, CTE2: Get the count per variant and rank them.

I can do a group by on variant_sequence from variant_per_case.

WITH variant_per_case AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(case_id) AS variant_count,

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(case_id) DESC) AS rn

    FROM variant_per_case

    GROUP BY variant_sequence

)

ROW_NUMBER() is assigned after grouping, but in the GROUP BY, I'm grouping by variant_sequence, so COUNT(case_id) is fine.

In the subquery, variant_per_case already has case_id and variant_sequence.

In variant_counts, I should group by variant_sequence and count the number of case_id.

Since variant_per_case has one row per case, grouping by variant_sequence and counting case_id will give the frequency.

To get top K, I can use ROW_NUMBER or just select with LIMIT.

But ROW_NUMBER might be better to handle the ordering.

Since I'm grouping, I can do:

SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS variant_count

FROM variant_per_case

GROUP BY variant_sequence

ORDER BY variant_count DESC

LIMIT K;

But this gives me only the top K variant_sequences, but if I use LIMIT, I don't have a row number, but I can still get the variant_sequences.

Then, I can use those to filter.

In SQL, to use it in a subquery, I might need to handle it.

I can use a CTE with the counts and then select where rn <= K.

Let me define:

WITH variant_per_case AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_stats AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS variant_count,

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn

    FROM variant_per_case

    GROUP BY variant_sequence  -- wait, no, I need to group by variant_sequence first.

Mistake.

In variant_stats, I should select from variant_per_case, group by variant_sequence.

But ROW_NUMBER() OVER () needs to be applied after grouping.

In SQL, window functions are applied after aggregation.

Standard way: first group by variant_sequence to get counts, then apply window function.

In the GROUP BY clause, I can compute the count, then use window function in a outer query.

Better to do:

WITH variant_per_case AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS variant_count

    FROM variant_per_case

    GROUP BY variant_sequence

),

ranked_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, variant_count,

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rn

    FROM variant_counts

)

Now, I have ranked variants, with rn from 1 to N.

Then, select the top K: where rn <= K.

But rn is based on order, so for top K, rn <= K.

Then, get the variant_sequences where rn <= K.

Then, join back to variant_per_case to get the case_ids that have those variant_sequences.

Then, join back to the original event_log to get all events for those case_ids.

Since I have case_ids from variant_per_case where variant_sequence is in top K.

First, from ranked_variants, select variant_sequence where rn <= K.

Let me call this top_variants.

WITH ... as above,

top_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence

    FROM ranked_variants

    WHERE rn <= K

)

K is a parameter. In the query, I need to specify K or make it a parameter.

The prompt doesn't specify how K is given, probably I need to assume it's a value or use a parameter.

In SQL, I can use a parameter, like :K or something, but in DuckDB, I think it supports parameters.

For the query, I can write it with a placeholder.

But for now, I'll assume K is given.

Then, now, filter variant_per_case where variant_sequence IN (select variant_sequence from top_variants)

variant_per_case has variant_sequence, so I can do:

filtered_cases AS (

    SELECT case_id

    FROM variant_per_case

    WHERE variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM top_variants)

)

Then, finally, select from event_log where case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases)

And return all columns: case_id, activity, timestamp.

The prompt says "Return all events from the original event log", so probably select * from event_log where case_id in the filtered set.

Now, about the STRING_AGG with ORDER BY.

I need to confirm if DuckDB supports STRING_AGG with ORDER BY.

Upon a quick search in my knowledge, DuckDB does support STRING_AGG with an ORDER BY clause, similar to PostgreSQL.

For example: STRING_AGG(column, delimiter ORDER BY order_column)

Yes, so it should be fine.

If not, I might need a subquery to order the activities.

But I'll assume it works.

Now, the complete query.

I need to handle the parameter K.

In the final query, I should make it a single SQL query.

Also, in the ranked_variants, I used ROW_NUMBER, which assigns a unique row number, so even with ties, it will arbitrarily order them, but since the prompt doesn't specify tie-breaking, it should be ok.

I could use RANK() or DENSE_RANK(), but ROW_NUMBER is fine for top K.

Now, the output should be the events, so with columns case_id, activity, timestamp.

Probably in no particular order, or perhaps ordered by case_id and timestamp, but the prompt doesn't specify, so I can just return them as is, or maybe order by case_id and timestamp to make it neat.

But not specified, so minimal is fine.

Now, to put it all together.

I need to define K. Since it's a benchmark, probably K is given, or I need to make it a variable.

In the query, I can use a parameter.

But for the answer, I'll write the query with K as a placeholder.

Now, writing the CTEs.

WITH variant_per_case AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS variant_count

    FROM variant_per_case

    GROUP BY variant_sequence

),

ranked_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, variant_count,

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rn

    FROM variant_counts

),

top_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence

    FROM ranked_variants

    WHERE rn <= ?  -- assuming ? is the parameter for K

),

filtered_cases AS (

    SELECT case_id

    FROM variant_per_case

    WHERE variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM top_variants)

)

SELECT el.*

FROM event_log el

JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id;

In the JOIN, I can do it, or use IN clause.

Using JOIN might be more efficient, but IN clause is also fine.

I can do:

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id IN (

    SELECT case_id

    FROM variant_per_case

    WHERE variant_sequence IN (

        SELECT variant_sequence

        FROM ranked_variants

        WHERE rn <= ?

    )

)

But with CTEs, it's clearer.

In the WITH clause, I can define all and then select.

In the subquery for IN, I need to compute the variant_sequence first.

With CTEs, it's fine.

To avoid computing variant_per_case multiple times, CTEs are good.

In DuckDB, CTEs might be optimized.

In the filtered_cases, I'm selecting case_id where variant_sequence in top_variants.

top_variants comes from ranked_variants, which comes from variant_counts, which comes from variant_per_case.

It should be fine.

I could combine some steps.

But this is clear.

About the parameter K: in the query, I used ? , assuming it's a placeholder.

In the final answer, I should write the SQL query.

The prompt says "Construct a DuckDB SQL query", so I need to provide the SQL code.

In the ranking, if there are multiple variants with the same count, ROW_NUMBER will assign arbitrary order, so the top K might exclude some with the same count as the Kth.

But as per prompt, it's acceptable.

I could use RANK() or DENSE_RANK(), but then for rn <= K, it might include more than K if there are ties.

The prompt says "top K variants by their frequency", probably meaning exactly K, or up to K.

To be precise, I'll stick with ROW_NUMBER.

Now, the final select.

In the output, I need to return the events, so SELECT * FROM event_log where case_id in the filtered set.

In my CTE approach, I have:

After defining the CTEs, I can do:

SELECT el.*

FROM event_log el

INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id;

To include the order, perhaps ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp, but not necessary.

Now, I think this should work.

In the STRING_AGG, the delimiter '->' is fine, but I need to make sure that activity names don't contain '->', but probably assumed not, or it's ok.

I could use a different delimiter, like a comma or something, but '->' is common for sequences.

Now, the complete query.

I need to specify K.

In the benchmark prompt, it might be part of the query.

I should write the query with a comment for K.

Now, to box the answer.

Before that, let me write the SQL.

Assuming K is a parameter.

In SQL, I can write:

WITH variant_per_case AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS variant_count

    FROM variant_per_case

    GROUP BY variant_sequence

),

ranked_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, variant_count,

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rn

    FROM variant_counts

),

top_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence

    FROM ranked_variants

    WHERE rn <= :K  -- use :K as parameter for K

),

filtered_cases AS (

    SELECT case_id

    FROM variant_per_case

    WHERE variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM top_variants)

)

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);

In the last part, I can directly join or use IN.

To make it a single query without extra subquery, but it's fine.

I can simplify.

After having top_variants, I can do:

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id IN (

    SELECT case_id

    FROM variant_per_case

    WHERE variant_sequence IN (

        SELECT variant_sequence

        FROM ranked_variants

        WHERE rn <= :K

    )

)

And define the CTEs up to ranked_variants.

In the WITH clause, I need to include all necessary CTEs.

In my earlier CTEs, variant_per_case and variant_counts are needed for ranked_variants.

ranked_variants depends on variant_counts, which depends on variant_per_case.

So, in the query, I can have:

WITH variant_per_case AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_counts AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS variant_count

    FROM variant_per_case

    GROUP BY variant_sequence

),

ranked_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence,

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rn  -- I don't need variant_count here if not used, but it's ok.

    FROM variant_counts  -- actually, in ranked_variants, I have variant_count, but for top_variants, I only need variant_sequence and rn.

I can combine.

I can do without variant_counts CTE.

I can do:

WITH variant_per_case AS (

    SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

ranked_variants AS (

    SELECT variant_sequence,

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY variant_sequence) DESC) AS rn  -- wait, no.

Mistake.

I cannot compute count in the window directly.

Better to keep variant_counts.

Standard way is to group first to get counts.

I can do the group by and window in one go, but in SQL, it's usually separate.

In DuckDB, I think the CTE approach is fine.

Now, for the final select.

To avoid the extra filtered_cases CTE, I can inline it.

But with CTEs, it's clearer.

Now, in the answer, I'll write the SQL query.

About the parameter: I'll use :K as a placeholder.

Now, I think this should work.

One thing: in the STRING_AGG, the ORDER BY timestamp, I assume timestamp is of datetime type, and it sorts correctly.

Probably yes.

Also, ensure that timestamp is unique per case or handles ties, but if there are multiple events at same timestamp, the order might be arbitrary, but probably assumed timestamps are unique or order is defined.

Prompt doesn't specify, so I'll assume STRING_AGG with ORDER BY timestamp is sufficient.

Now, the final query.
</think>

```sql
-- DuckDB SQL query to find all events from cases belonging to the top K process variants by frequency.

-- Parameter :K should be replaced with the desired value of K or bound as a parameter.
WITH variant_per_case AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id

        variant_sequence, 
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count

``` 

### Explanation:
- **variant_per_case CTE**: Groups events by `case_id` and uses `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp` to create an ordered sequence of activities for each case, stored as a string delimited by '->'.
- **variant_counts CTE**: Groups the sequences from `variant_per_case` and counts the number of cases for each unique variant sequence.
- **ranked_variants CTE**: Applies a `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to rank variants by their count in descending order.
- **top_variants CTE**: Filters the variants to include only those with a row number less than or equal to K, identifying the top K variants.
- **filtered_cases CTE**: Selects the `case_id`s that correspond to the top K variants by matching the variant sequences.
- **Final SELECT**: Retrieves all events from the original `event_log` table for the filtered case IDs, excluding cases not in the top K variants.

This query ensures that the sequence is correctly ordered, variants are grouped and counted, and only events from the top K variants are returned. The parameter `:K` should be set to the desired value of K when executing the query in DuckDB.
