**Explanation of Added Constraints:**

1.  **Coexistence Constraints:**

    *   `"Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, "Approve_Elderly": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, "Reject_Elderly": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints ensure that whenever a decision (`Approve` or `Reject`) is made specifically for an applicant identified as belonging to a sensitive group (e.g., "Minority," "Elderly"), a manual review (`ManualReview`) must also occur in the process trace. This is to ensure additional scrutiny and accountability for decisions concerning sensitive demographics, helping reduce the potential for automated bias.

2.  **Response Constraints:**

    *   `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints require a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity to always follow any checks revealing sensitive information (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantAge`). This ensures that before proceeding with further steps, especially a decision, a mitigation step must be included after the information has been registered to limit biases.

3. **Succession Constraints:**

    *    `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`
    *    **Rationale:** These constraints enforce that any decision activities (`Approve`, `Reject`) must be preceded by a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that the decision process is tied to an earlier check for potential biases and that decisions are made after this step.

4.  **Non-succession Constraints:**

    *   `"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints prevent a direct transition from checking sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantAge`) immediately followed by a rejection (`Reject`).  This limits direct bias that may happen if we rely on these sensitive attributes too fast and too harshly.

By combining these constraints, the process model now has a stronger safeguard against potential biases related to sensitive applicant attributes. The inclusion of `ManualReview` for sensitive cases, `BiasMitigationCheck` after attribute checks, enforcing the succession of a bias mitigation before decisions, and restricting the sequence of events from attribute check to a reject decision provides multiple layers of verification and makes the process more fair and reliable, helping ensure more equitable outcomes in the loan application review process.
