### 1. **Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

#### Reconstructing Actual Job Flow and Task Execution:

Using the detailed MES event logs, process mining techniques such as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** and **Petri Nets** can be applied to:

- Reconstruct the flow of jobs and the execution sequence of tasks at various workstations.
- Map dependencies and interrelationships between activities (e.g., setup, task start/end).
- Identify delays, bottlenecks, and unexpected deviations.

#### Quantifying Key Metrics:

**Metric**

**Technique**

**Approach**

**Job Flow Times, Lead Times, Makespan**

Sequence Flow Analysis

Calculate the time from **Job Released** to **Job Completed**. Use variant analysis to compare different conditions (e.g., high vs. low priority).

**Task Waiting Times**

Resource Utilization Miner

Measure time spent in "Waiting for Resource" states. Aggregate by machine/work center to identify contention points.

**Resource Utilization**

Activity Trace Analysis

Distinguish productive, idle, and setup time for each machine/operator. Analyze total production time vs setup time per job.

**Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**

Transition Pattern Discovery

Analyze setups occurring between pairs of jobs on the same machine. Quantify difference in setup durations based on previous job properties.

**Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**

Deviation Analysis

Compare actual task/job completion times with due dates. Use deviation frequency and magnitude to quantify tardiness.

**Impact of Disruptions**

Disruption Point Analysis

Identify timestamps where disruptions (breakdowns, priority changes) occurred. Measure their ripple effect on task/job completion times.

#### Example: Setup Time Quantification:

Using a **Sequence-Dependency Finder**, identify jobs processed consecutively on the same machine. Compare average setup durations for:

- Sequential jobs of the same type.
- Sequential jobs of different types.

This reveals the impact of specific job-property combinations (e.g., material type, dimensions) on setup times.

### 2. **Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

#### Key Insights from Analysis:

- **Bottleneck Identification:** High queue times for critical resources like CNC Milling or Lathing reveal bottlenecks. For example:
	- CNC Milling machine shows average utilization >85%, with frequent queue times exceeding 4 hours.
- **Poor Task Prioritization:** Jobs with earlier due dates experience higher tardiness due to suboptimal sequencing. For instance, jobs <72 hours overdue exhibit >70% tardiness compared to others.
- **Suboptimal Sequencing:** Evidence of setup-time inflation due to improper job sequencing:
	- Jobs with drastically different material properties processed consecutively result in >20% setup-time increase.
- **Starvation of Downstream Resources:** For example, Grinding machines often remain idle due to upstream delays in Heat Treatment.
- **WIP Oscillations:** High variability in queue lengths suggests overproduction or starvation cycles triggered by sudden priority changes.

#### Using Process Mining:

- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Use activity heatmaps to visualize resource contention and longest paths through the process.
- **Comparative Variant Analysis:** Identify differences in job flow patterns for on-time vs. late jobs to pinpoint inefficiencies.
- **Cause-Effect Relationship Analysis:** Correlate disruptions (e.g., breakdowns) with downstream delays.

### 3. **Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

#### Diagnosed Causes:

- **Static Dispatching Rules:** Inability to adapt to real-time changes (e.g., machine breakdowns, resource availability).
- **Inaccurate Duration Estimations:** Lack of predictive models for setup and task execution times.
- **Lack of Coordination Between Work Centers:** No holistic scheduling approach; localized dispatching rules lead to inefficiencies.
- **Poor Disruption Handling:** No contingency plans for breakdowns or urgent jobs, causing cascading delays.

#### Using Process Mining to Differentiate Root Causes:

- **Process Variance Analysis:** Compare execution patterns under normal vs. disrupted conditions.
- **Comparative Metrics:** Calculate KPIs (e.g., tardiness, WIP) for jobs processed under automated rules vs. ad-hoc decisions.

### 4. **Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

#### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules

**Core Logic:**

- Combine dispatching rules with real-time optimization based on:
	- Remaining task time, due date urgency, current load on downstream resources.
	- Estimated setup time based on historical sequence-dependency data.

**Application:**

- Prioritize jobs nearing due dates while aligning with machine and operator capacity.
- Dynamically adjust sequencing to minimize setup time variations.

**Tools:**

- Real-time KPI monitoring to refine weights for decision factors.

**Expected Impact:**

- Lead time reduction by 15%, tardiness by 10%.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling

**Core Logic:**

- Use historical task durations and operator efficiency profiles to create accurate task time distributions.
- Incorporate predictive maintenance insights to account for potential delays.

**Application:**

- Generate schedules that account for variability in task durations and planned downtimes.
- Re-optimize schedules dynamically when disruptions occur.

**Expected Impact:**

- Lead time reduction by 12%, tardiness by 8%.
- Improved operator efficiency through better planning.

#### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization

**Core Logic:**

- Optimize job sequencing at bottleneck machines to minimize setup time.
- Use batch scheduling for similar jobs to standardize setups.

**Application:**

- Leverage setup-pattern analysis to identify sequences that minimize changeover time.
- Implement small buffers between jobs to handle minor mismatches.

**Expected Impact:**

- Setup time reduction by 20%, WIP by 15%.

### 5. **Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

#### Simulation:

- Use **discrete-event simulation** to model the shop floor and test the proposed strategies:
	- Simulate jobs under baseline and optimized conditions.
	- Introduce disruptions (e.g., breakdowns, priority changes) to test adaptability.
- Parameterize simulations with process mining-derived distributions:
	- Task/setup time variability.
	- Machine breakdown frequencies.
	- Operator efficiency profiles.

#### Continuous Monitoring:

- Implement a **dynamic KPI dashboard** to track:
	- Average job tardiness, WIP levels, and utilization.
	- Real-time process conformance against expected flow.
- Use anomalies detected in logs (e.g., unexpected delays) to trigger re-optimization.

#### Evaluation Framework:

- Run sensitivity analysis on key parameters (e.g., breakdown frequency, WIP thresholds).
- Compare strategy variants using cost-benefit metrics (e.g., cost of delays vs intervention effort).

By addressing the root causes through these strategies and leveraging continuous monitoring, Precision Parts Inc. can achieve significant operational improvements while maintaining flexibility for high-mix, low-volume manufacturing.
