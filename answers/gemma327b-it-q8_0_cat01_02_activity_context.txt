## Justification of Naming Choices

The primary activity that required renaming was "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer".  "Initiate Request" was also renamed for consistency. Here's the reasoning:

*   **"Initiate Request"**: Renamed from "Initiate Request" to provide a consistent starting point for each case.
*   **"Verify Documents"**: This activity occurred in multiple contexts.
    *   **"Initial Document Verification"**: Used for the *first* time documents are checked, regardless of the channel.
    *   **"Re-verification of Documents"**: Used when documents are checked *again*, typically after an adjustment or additional information is provided. This clarifies that it's not the initial check.
*   **"Call Customer"**: This activity had different purposes:
    *   **"Request Missing Documents"**: Specifically when the call is to request missing documentation.
    *   **"Clarification Call"**: When the call is to clarify an account discrepancy.
    *   **"Confirmation Call"**: When the call is to confirm adjustments made.
    *   **"Customer Recall"**: When the call is to ask the customer to return to the branch.

These changes aim to make the event log more informative and easier to analyze, as the activity names now reflect the specific actions being taken within each case. This is crucial for process mining and understanding the flow of work within the support workflow.
