This BPMN-like textual model outlines the **Invoice Approval and Payment Process** based on the provided stakeholder interviews.

---

### **Process Model: Invoice Approval and Payment**

#### **1. Participants (Lanes)**
*   **Supplier (External):** Sends invoices and provides corrections.
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk (Mary):** Primary process owner, handles logging, matching, and scheduling.
*   **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Verifies receipt of goods/services and price/quantity accuracy.
*   **Department Manager (Carlos):** Provides final fiscal approval.
*   **AP Supervisor (Rita):** Handles complex exceptions and "no-PO" scenarios.
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Resolves contract or communication disputes with suppliers.

---

#### **2. Process Flow (Sequence of Steps)**

**Phase 1: Receipt and Validation**
1.  **Start Event:** Invoice received via email (AP Clerk).
2.  **Task:** Check for valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
3.  **Gateway (Exclusive): Is PO Number present?**
    *   **No:** 
        *   **Task:** Request details from supplier. 
        *   **Exception Path:** If the invoice is for an "informal service" without a PO, the **AP Supervisor** works with department heads to create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice.
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to **Log invoice into Accounting System**.

**Phase 2: Purchasing Verification**
4.  **Task:** Forward invoice to **Purchasing Department**.
5.  **Task (Dan):** Compare invoice quantities, prices, and delivery charges against the PO and physical receipt of goods.
6.  **Gateway (Exclusive): Is there a discrepancy in Purchasing?**
    *   **Yes:** 
        *   **Task:** Dan contacts the Supplier or requests AP Clerk to hold the invoice.
        *   **Sub-Process (Resolution):** **Supplier Relationship Manager** may be looped in to check contract terms or request a revised invoice.
    *   **No:** Send confirmation email to AP Clerk.

**Phase 3: Matching and Escalation**
7.  **Task (Mary):** Match invoice line items against the PO in the system.
8.  **Gateway (Exclusive): Do all line items match?**
    *   **No (Discrepancy):** 
        *   **Task:** Email Purchasing for clarification.
        *   **Gateway (Complex): Can it be resolved easily?**
            *   **No:** Escalate to **AP Supervisor (Rita)** for inter-departmental coordination.
            *   **Yes:** Proceed once corrected.
    *   **Yes:** System triggers an automatic notification for Manager Approval.

**Phase 4: Final Approval and Payment**
9.  **Task (Carlos):** Review invoice, PO, and confirmation in the system.
10. **Gateway (Exclusive): Manager Decision**
    *   **Reject/Hold:** If suspicious or over budget, invoice is sent back to **AP Clerk** for investigation.
    *   **Approve:** Hit "Approve" in the system.
11. **Task (Mary):** Add approved invoice to the next payment cycle and schedule for payment.
12. **End Event:** Payment Scheduled/Process Complete.

---

#### **3. Data Objects / Artifacts**
*   **Invoice:** (Input) The primary document moving through the flow.
*   **Purchase Order (PO):** (Data Object) Used for matching and validation.
*   **Confirmation Email:** (Artifact) Sent by Purchasing to AP to signal receipt verification.
*   **Accounting System:** (System) The central repository for logging and approvals.

---

#### **4. Exceptions and Variations (Annotated)**

*   **Informal Service Exception:** (Identified by Rita) Invoices without POs because they were contracted informally are diverted to a manual "retrospective PO" creation process before they can re-enter the standard flow.
*   **Supplier Coordination Conflict:** There is a slight overlap in roles regarding supplier contact. Dan (Purchasing) indicates he contacts suppliers directly for quantity issues, while Mary (AP) and Karen (SRM) also contact suppliers for missing POs or price discrepancies.
    *   *Model Assumption:* Functional issues (quantity/delivery) are handled by Purchasing; Administrative/Contractual issues are handled by AP or SRM.
*   **Rework Loop:** If the Manager (Carlos) rejects an invoice, it returns to the AP Clerk (Mary), effectively restarting the matching or verification phase.
*   **Escalation Path:** Rita only enters the process when standard matching or purchasing verification fails to resolve a discrepancy within the immediate team.
