This visualization is a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram** that illustrates the **shipment preparation process** for a computer hardware shop. It is divided into **three swimlanes** representing the roles or departments involved:

1. **Dispatch of Goods (Computer Hardware Shop Secretary)**
2. **Logistics**
3. **Warehouse**

---

###  Process Overview:

The main flow starts with the task **"Ship goods"**, indicating the initiation of shipment preparation.

---

###  Detailed Steps:

#### **Dispatch of Goods Lane**
1. **Ship goods** – Process initiation.
2. A parallel gateway () **triggers two paths**:
   - One goes to **clarify shipment method**.
   - The other directly flows to **package goods** in the Warehouse.

3. **Clarify shipment method**  Checks for **special handling** (XOR gateway):
   - If "No":
     - Goes to **check if insurance is required** using **order and customer information**.
     - If insurance is necessary:  **insure parcel**.
     - Always:  **write package label**.
   - If "Yes":
     - **Get 3 offers** from logistic companies.
     - **Select logistic company & place order**.
     - Then:  **write package label**.

#### **Warehouse Lane**
4. From the other parallel flow:
   - **Package goods**
   - Waits **48 hours** (timer event). If delay, then sends a task to:
     - **Notify customer about delay**.
   - Ends at a merging gateway (plus sign) to synchronize flows with Dispatch.

5. The merged flow leads to:
   - **Fill out shipment paperwork**
   - **Move package to pickup area**
   - Ends at  **Shipment prepared** (end event).

---

###  Logic/Decisions:
- **XOR Gateway** used to diverge the path based on "Special handling?" and "Insurance required?".
- **Parallel Gateways** used for:
  - Splitting the flow into packing and documenting.
  - Synchronizing paths back after parallel processing.

---

###  Key Artifacts:
- Data Objects: **Order details**, **Customer information**
- Delays handled with **timer events** and **customer notification**
- Interaction between Warehouse and Logistics handled through seamless process flow.

---

###  Purpose:
The diagram aims to **standardize the package shipment process**, ensuring both routine and special shipments are covered, tracked, and documented efficiently.
