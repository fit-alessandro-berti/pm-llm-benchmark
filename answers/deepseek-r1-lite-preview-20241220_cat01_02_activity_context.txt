### Renaming Activities Based on Contextual Differences

#### Step 1: Identify Repeating Activities and Their Contexts

- **"Verify Documents"**: Appears multiple times in different cases, with varying purposes such as initial verification, re-verification after additional submissions, and post-adjustment verification.
- **"Call Customer"**: Appears multiple times, with different objectives like requesting missing documents, clarifying discrepancies, confirming adjustments, or requesting a customer's return.
- **"Submit Additional"**: Refers to submitting additional documents.
- **"Adjust Account"**: Involves internal adjustments to the account, but occurs in different contexts.

#### Step 2: Rename Activities to Reflect Their Contexts

- **"Verify Documents"**:
  - "Initial Document Verification" (first check of submitted documents)
  - "Re-verify Documents" (after additional documents are submitted)
  - "Physical Document Verification" (physical verification by BranchOfficer)
  - "Re-verification Post Adjustment" (after account adjustments)
  
- **"Call Customer"**:
  - "Call for Missing Documents" (requesting missing documents)
  - "Call for Clarification" (clarifying account discrepancies)
  - "Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments" (confirming internal adjustments)
  - "Call to Request Customer Return" (requesting customer to return to the branch)

- **"Submit Additional"** → "Submit Additional Documents"

- **"Adjust Account"** → "Internal Account Adjustment"
