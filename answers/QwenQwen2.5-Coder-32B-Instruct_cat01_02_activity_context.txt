To disambiguate activities that recur within each case, we'll carefully analyze their position in the process and their associated context. We will then rename these activities to clearly reflect their specific role along with a rationale for the renaming.

First, let's identify activities with multiple occurrences within a single case and investigate their specific contexts:

### Activities to Rename:

1. **Call Customer**
2. **Verify Documents**

### Renaming and Rationale:

#### Call Customer
- **Original:** Both calls involve Customer interaction but serve different purposes.
    - **First call** in each case is to request additional documentation or resolve discrepancies.
    - **Follow-up call** is to confirm adjustments or further information.

- **Renamed:**
    - **First Call:** `Request Additional Information Call` or simply `Info Request Call`
    - **Follow-up Call:** `Follow-up Verification Call` or `Confirm Adjustments Call`

#### Verify Documents
- **Original:** Document verification occurs more than once due to multiple stages or issues.
    - **Initial Verification:** Documents are verified upon receiving the initial request.
    - **Re-verification:** Verification is re-conducted after receiving additional documents or after resolving specific issues.

- **Renamed:**
    - **Initial Verification:** `Initial Document Verification`
    - **Re-verification:** `Post-Document Adjustment Verification`

### Justification:

- **Call Customer:** "Info Request Call" clearly indicates the purpose of requesting additional information or resolving initial discrepancies, whereas "Confirm Adjustments Call" identifies the follow-up action of confirming previous account adjustments.
- **Verify Documents:** "Initial Document Verification" highlights the first assessment step, and "Post-Document Adjustment Verification" specifies the document check after account adjustments have been made, ensuring that the contextual differences are readily understood.
