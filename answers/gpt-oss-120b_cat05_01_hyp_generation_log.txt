We need to respond with a prompt for target LLM that encourages it to identify anomalies, hypothesize reasons, propose SQL queries. So we should produce a prompt text that can be fed to LLM. Should be clear, maybe bullet points. No need to execute queries. Ensure formatting. Use LaTeX? Not needed. Just plain text. Provide example of anomalies: out-of-order events, missing steps, early shipment, credit check after shipping, payment before invoice, etc. Then ask LLM to generate hypotheses and SQL queries. Provide instructions. Let's craft.

**Prompt for the Target LLM**

---

### Objective
Given the **`order_event_log`**, **`orders`**, and **`resources`** tables described above, the model should:

1. **Detect anomalies or undesirable behaviors** in the event logs (e.g., out‑of‑sequence activities, missing mandatory steps, premature or delayed events, contradictory resource usage, etc.).
2. **Formulate plausible explanations** for each detected anomaly (e.g., system glitches, policy breaches, data‑entry errors, training deficiencies, exceptional business cases).
3. **Propose concrete SQL queries**—targeting `order_event_log` and, where useful, `orders` or `resources`—that a analyst could run to verify or further explore each hypothesis.

The model must **produce the analysis and the SQL statements without any additional guidance**; it should generate the queries entirely on its own based on the observed irregularities.

---

### Required Output Structure

1. **Anomaly Summary** – Brief description of each irregular pattern found.
2. **Hypotheses** – One or more possible reasons why the pattern occurred.
3. **Investigative SQL Queries** – For every hypothesis, write at least one SQL query that would help confirm or refute it.  
   - Queries should be syntactically correct for PostgreSQL.  
   - Use clear aliases and comment each query to explain its purpose.  
   - If a hypothesis involves data from multiple tables, include appropriate `JOIN`s.

*If multiple anomalies exist, repeat the three‑step block for each one.*

### Example (illustrative only – **do not** include this in the final answer)

```sql
-- 1️⃣ Detect orders where “Ship Goods” occurs before “Perform Credit Check”
SELECT DISTINCT o.case_id
FROM order_event_log o
WHERE o.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM order_event_log c
    WHERE c.case_id = o.case_id
      AND c.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
      AND c.timestamp > o.timestamp
  );
```

*The model’s actual response should contain real anomalies observed in the supplied data, realistic hypotheses, and tailored SQL queries.*

---

### Constraints

- **No external data**: Use only the tables and columns described.
- **No assumptions beyond the schema**: If a hypothesis requires additional information, note that the query would need that data.
- **Clarity**: Each SQL block must be self‑contained and include a comment line (`--`) summarising its investigative goal.
- **Formatting**: Present the output in plain text, using the structure above. Do not embed LaTeX or markdown formatting beyond the SQL code blocks.

### Deliverable

> **Your answer should start with the first detected anomaly, followed by its hypotheses and the corresponding SQL queries, then proceed to the next anomaly (if any).**
