 The given data appears to represent a complex business process involving multiple stakeholders and stages in the approval and payment of declarations or requests. Based on the transitions and their frequencies, here's an attempt to describe the process:

### Stakeholders:
1. **EMPLOYEE**: Initiates the declaration.
2. **PRE_APPROVER**: Provides initial approval.
3. **ADMINISTRATION**: Oversees administrative approvals.
4. **SUPERVISOR**: Gives final approval.
5. **BUDGET OWNER**: Checks budget constraints.
6. **MISSING**: Represents an undefined or absent role causing rejections.

### Process Flow:
1. **EMPLOYEE** submits a declaration.
    - The declaration may be rejected by **ADMINISTRATION**, **PRE_APPROVER**, or **SUPERVISOR**, leading back to the **EMPLOYEE**.
    - It might also be saved, but then proceeds directly to the payment request stage.
2. **ADMINISTRATION** reviews and either:
    - Approves the declaration.
    - Rejects it (leads back to **EMPLOYEE**).
3. If approved by **ADMINISTRATION**:
    - It may then go through additional approvals by **PRE_APPROVER**, **BUDGET OWNER**, or directly to **SUPERVISOR**.
    - If there is an issue (e.g., MISSING entity), it can result in a rejection looping back to the employee.
4. Once approved by all required entities:
    - **EMPLOYEE** requests payment.
    - The payment request may encounter issues with **MISSING** roles leading to rejections, or it might proceed to being handled successfully.
5. If the payment is handled:
    - It may be deemed complete.
    - There can also be subsequent rejections looping back to the employee.
6. In specific edge cases:
    - Declarations might be saved and then directly request a payment.
    - Rejected declarations by **SUPERVISOR** or **PRE_APPROVER** could also lead directly to requesting payments under certain conditions.
7. The process includes infrequent paths where the declaration can be in a "FOR_APPROVAL" state by different entities (e.g., **SUPERVISOR**, **PRE_APPROVER**, or **ADMINISTRATION**), but these lead to rejections if not properly handled.

### Key Transitions:
- **EMPLOYEE** submits a declaration which can be approved/rejected at various stages (by different entities).
- Declarations can loop back to the employee in case of rejection or save states.
- Payment requests follow successful approval paths but include potential issues causing rejections.

### Summary:
The process is designed to handle declarations from **EMPLOYEE** through a series of approvals by various roles (including administrative checks, pre-approvals, budget reviews, and final supervisory approvals). It includes mechanisms for handling errors or missing entities that cause rejections leading back to the originator. Payment processing is a critical final step but can also encounter issues looping the process back.

This structured flow aims to ensure comprehensive validation and approval of declarations before any payments are made, with built-in redundancy to handle common errors or missing steps in the process.
