### **Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance**

---

## **1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Constraints)**

**Normative violations represent serious deviations from the mandatory process logic.**  
Based on the event log and the defined sequence/ordering rules:

### **Case 2: Multiple Normative Violations**

- **Violation 1: Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  
  - **Observed**: `Risk Assessment` at 08:20 on 2024-01-11 occurs **before** `Credit Check` at 09:00.  
  - **Rule Broken**: *"Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."*  
  - **Impact**: This reverses a mandatory dependency, potentially leading to an uninformed or invalid risk evaluation.

- **Violation 2: Finalize Documentation after Rejection**  
  - **Observed**: `Loan Decision (Rejected)` at 09:30, followed by `Finalize Documentation` at 10:00.  
  - **Rule Broken**: *"If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."*  
  - **Impact**: Performing documentation finalization after a rejection contradicts the decision logic and wastes resources.

- **Conclusion**: **Case 2 is non-compliant with normative process rules** and represents a **serious process deviation**.

---

### **Cases 1 and 3: No Normative Violations**

- **Case 1**:  
  - Perfect adherence to the required sequence:  
    `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`  
  - All ordering and conditional rules respected.

- **Case 3**:  
  - Sequence is correct:  
    `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`  
  - No skipped, reversed, or contradictory steps.  
  - Although timing is delayed, **the order and logic are preserved**, so **no normative violation**.

## **2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended Best Practices)**

Desiderata violations are **not serious**, but indicate **suboptimal performance**.

### **Case 3: Multiple Desiderata Violations**

- **Violation 1: Credit Check Delayed Beyond 24 Hours**  
  - **Application Received**: 2024-01-12 09:00  
  - **Credit Check**: 2024-01-14 10:00  **~55 hours later**  
  - **Desideratum**: Should occur within 24 hours.  
  - **Interpretation**: Possible backlog, staffing shortage, or system delay. Not a rule break, but slows the process.

- **Violation 2: Inform Applicant Delayed Beyond 48 Hours Post-Decision**  
  - **Loan Decision (Approved)**: 2024-01-14 12:00  
  - **Inform Applicant**: 2024-01-16 15:00  **~51 hours later**  
  - **Desideratum**: Notification within 48 hours of decision.  
  - **Interpretation**: May reflect manual handling delays or communication bottlenecks.

- **Violation 3: No Follow-up Call**  
  - **Desideratum**: A follow-up call is encouraged before case closure to ensure alignment.  
  - **Observed**: No such activity in the log.  
  - **Interpretation**: Team may have deemed it unnecessary (e.g., clear documentation), or it was simply omitted due to workload.

- **Conclusion**: **Case 3 fully complies with normative rules but exhibits suboptimal timing and omits a recommended step.**

---

### **Case 1: Fully Compliant with Desiderata (Implicitly)**

- **Credit Check**: 30 minutes after application  **within 24 hours **  
- **Inform Applicant**: 2 hours after decision  **within 48 hours **  
- **Follow-up Call**: Not recorded, but since it’s optional and not required, its absence is acceptable.  
  - *Note*: The desideratum says it’s “encouraged,” not expected in every case. So **no violation**.

### **Case 2: Desiderata Not Evaluated Due to Normative Failure**

- Since Case 2 already violates core rules, desiderata assessment is secondary.  
- However, even if considered:  
  - Credit Check occurred within 20 minutes of application  **meets timing desideratum**.  
  - Inform Applicant occurred 30 minutes after decision  **within 48 hours **.  
  - No Follow-up Call  minor omission, but again, overshadowed by serious normative issues.

---

## **3. Interpretations & Justifications**

### **Case 2: Likely Process Misconfiguration or Human Error**
- The out-of-order execution (`Risk Assessment` before `Credit Check`) suggests either:
  - A system flaw allowing parallel or unordered task assignment, or  
  - An employee bypassing protocol due to urgency or misunderstanding.
- Finalizing documentation after rejection may indicate:
  - A generic “close-out” template applied regardless of decision, or  
  - Lack of conditional workflow logic in the case management system.

> **Recommendation**: Implement system-enforced sequencing (e.g., workflow engine that blocks Risk Assessment until Credit Check is complete) and decision-dependent activity gating (e.g., disable “Finalize Documentation” if decision = Rejected).

---

### **Case 3: Operational Delays, Not Process Flaws**
- Delays likely stem from:
  - Weekend/holiday gaps (application on Jan 12 [Friday], next activity on Jan 14 [Sunday]—though timestamps suggest weekend work, possibly in a 24/7 operation).
  - High caseload or manual review bottlenecks.
- Absence of follow-up call may reflect:
  - Discretionary application of best practices, or  
  - Resource prioritization (e.g., follow-ups only for complex loans).

> **Recommendation**: Monitor cycle times and consider SLA alerts for desiderata thresholds. Encourage—but don’t mandate—follow-up calls, perhaps via checklist prompts.

---

### **Case 1: Model Execution**
- Represents ideal behavior: fast, ordered, and complete.
- Serves as a benchmark for process performance.

## **Summary Table**

| Case ID | Normative Violation? | Desiderata Violation? | Overall Status                     |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1      |  No                  |  No                  | **Fully compliant**                |
| 2      |  Yes (2 violations)  |  (Timing OK, but irrelevant) | **Non-compliant – requires correction** |
| 3      |  No                  |  Yes (3 issues)      | **Compliant but suboptimal**       |

**Final Note**:  
- **Normative compliance is mandatory** for process integrity and auditability.  
- **Desiderata adherence improves customer experience and efficiency**, but does not invalidate outcomes.  
- Process improvement should **first fix normative violations**, then **optimize desiderata performance**.
