### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**

Normative rules define **strict, mandatory constraints**. Violations represent **serious process deviations**.

---

#### **Case 2 — Multiple Normative Violations**

**Violations:**
-  **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check**  
  *Timestamps:* Risk Assessment at 08:20  Credit Check at 09:00  
   Violates the ordering rule: *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.*

-  **Finalize Documentation performed after Loan Decision (Rejected)**  
   Violates the conditional rule: *If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.*  
  Finalizing documentation after rejection is explicitly forbidden.

**Consequence:**  
This case is **non-compliant** with the core process logic. It breaks the mandatory sequence and performs an explicitly prohibited action (documentation after rejection).

---

#### **Case 1 — No Normative Violations**

All activities occur in the correct sequence:  
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

 Fully compliant with all normative constraints.

---

#### **Case 3 — No Normative Violations**

Sequence:  
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

 All mandatory ordering and conditional rules are followed.  
 No documentation after rejection (loan was approved).  
 No skipped or reversed steps.

 **Normatively compliant.**

---

>  **Summary of Normative Compliance:**
> - **Case 1:** Compliant
> - **Case 2:**  Violates 2 normative rules (wrong order + forbidden documentation)
> - **Case 3:** Compliant

---

### **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata (Recommended Best Practices)**

Desiderata are **soft recommendations** — deviations are **not violations**, but indicate **suboptimal or less ideal behavior**.

---

#### **Case 3 — Desiderata Violations**

-  **Credit Check delayed beyond 24 hours**  
  Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00  
  Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00  **~55 hours later**  
   Exceeds the recommended 24-hour window.  
   *Suboptimal, but not a violation.*

-  **Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48 hours after Loan Decision**  
  Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00  
  Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00  **~51 hours later**  
   Slightly exceeds 48-hour recommendation.  
   *Suboptimal, but acceptable under normative rules.*

-  **No Follow-up Call performed**  
   The desideratum encourages a Follow-up Call before closing.  
   Absence is not prohibited, but represents a missed opportunity for alignment/customer care.

 **All three desiderata are unmet in Case 3.**

---

#### **Case 1 — Partial Desiderata Adherence**

-  Credit Check within 30 minutes of Application Received  **Meets 24-hour window**  
-  Inform Applicant within 2 hours of Loan Decision  **Meets 48-hour window**  
-  **No Follow-up Call recorded**  Missed recommended step.

 Only **one** desideratum missed (Follow-up Call).

---

#### **Case 2 — Desiderata Not Evaluated Due to Normative Violations**

Although we could check timing or follow-up, the case is already **non-compliant** at the normative level. Desiderata analysis is **secondary** and less meaningful when core rules are broken.

Still, for completeness:
- Credit Check occurred ~1 hour after Application   within 24h  
- Inform Applicant occurred 30 minutes after Loan Decision   within 48h  
- No Follow-up Call   missed

 But since the case is normatively broken, these “soft” metrics are overshadowed.

---

>  **Summary of Desiderata Failures:**
> - **Case 1:** Missed Follow-up Call (1 desideratum)
> - **Case 2:** Missed Follow-up Call (1 desideratum — though normative failure dominates)
> - **Case 3:** Missed all 3 desiderata (late Credit Check, late Inform Applicant, no Follow-up Call)

---

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**

While deviations from desiderata are not violations, they may reflect operational realities or trade-offs.

---

#### **Case 3 — Delays and Missing Follow-up**

- **Late Credit Check (55h):**  
   *Possible Justification:* High application volume, staff shortage, or system delay.  
   *Interpretation:* Process is still correct, but efficiency and customer experience may suffer.

- **Late Inform Applicant (51h):**  
   *Possible Justification:* Decision required managerial approval, or notification system was backlogged.  
   *Interpretation:* Communication lag may reduce customer satisfaction but doesn’t invalidate the process.

- **No Follow-up Call:**  
   *Possible Justification:* Resource constraints, or deemed unnecessary for low-risk approved loans.  
   *Interpretation:* Missed opportunity for service excellence, but not a compliance issue.

 **Overall:** Case 3 is a good example of a **technically compliant but operationally sluggish** process.

---

#### **Case 2 — Normative Violations**

- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**  
   *Possible Justification:* Staff error, system misconfiguration, or attempt to expedite process.  
   *Interpretation:* This fundamentally breaks risk management logic — creditworthiness must be checked before risk is assessed. Serious governance issue.

- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**  
   *Possible Justification:* Miscommunication, automation error, or staff misunderstanding policy.  
   *Interpretation:* Wastes resources and may create legal/audit exposure. Must be corrected.

 **Overall:** Case 2 reflects **process breakdown** — requires retraining, system fixes, or audit controls.

---

#### **Case 1 — Ideal Behavior with Minor Gap**

- Only missing Follow-up Call.  
   *Possible Justification:* Follow-up deemed unnecessary for straightforward approvals, or staff forgot to log it.  
   *Interpretation:* Nearly perfect execution — adding the follow-up would make it exemplary.

---

###  **Final Summary**

| Case | Normative Compliance | Desiderata Compliance | Interpretation |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| 1    |  Fully compliant    |  Minor (missed follow-up) | Model case — efficient and correct, minor service gap |
| 2    |  Violates 2 rules   |  Missed follow-up (overshadowed) | Process failure — requires intervention and correction |
| 3    |  Fully compliant    |  All 3 desiderata missed | Slow but correct — needs efficiency/service improvements |

---

###  **Recommendations**

- **For Case 2:** Immediate process audit, staff retraining, and possibly system automation to enforce mandatory sequencing.
- **For Case 3:** Investigate causes of delays (resource allocation? bottlenecks?) and consider incentivizing follow-up calls to improve customer experience.
- **For Case 1:** Consider making the Follow-up Call a logged optional step to encourage adoption without enforcing it strictly.

This analysis separates **what must be fixed** (normative violations) from **what could be improved** (desiderata gaps) — enabling targeted process governance.
