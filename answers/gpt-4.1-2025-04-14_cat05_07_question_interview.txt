Certainly! Here are targeted, open-ended questions to clarify and deepen understanding of the property onboarding process:

---

### Documentation and Initial Review

1. **Can you walk me through the specific types of documentation that are considered mandatory versus optional for a new property onboarding?**
2. **What are the most common issues you encounter with missing or outdated documents, and how do you typically resolve them with landlords?**
3. **How do you track the status of document collection and verification—does the coordinator own this end-to-end, or are other teams involved?**

### Property Database and Recording Details

4. **Who is responsible for entering the initial property details into the central database, and how do you ensure data accuracy at this stage?**
5. **Are there any automated checks or validations in place when property details are being recorded? What are some common data entry errors?**

### Assignment of Property Manager

6. **How is the assignment of a property manager decided in practice—do you use a formal workload balancing tool, or is it a manual/managerial decision?**
7. **What factors influence matching a manager with a landlord—can landlords request a specific manager, or decline one that’s been chosen?**
8. **How is a manager’s geographic specialization determined and updated over time?**

### Onboarding Meeting

9. **In the introductory meeting, what core topics are always covered, and how is alignment with the landlord documented or confirmed afterwards?**
10. **How do you handle situations where there are disagreements or special requests from the landlord that fall outside standard policies?**

### Inspection and Photography

11. **How are vendors (photographers, inspectors, contractors) selected and scheduled? Are there service-level agreements or preferred vendor lists?**
12. **If the inspector finds issues requiring repairs, who is responsible for coordinating and overseeing these repairs—the property manager or someone else?**
13. **How is the timeline managed between inspection, repairs, and photography to avoid bottlenecks or delays?**

### Marketing and Listing Creation

14. **What criteria determine how marketing materials are created or customized for each property?**
15. **How do you ensure marketing collateral is consistent with both company standards and specific landlord preferences?**

### Activation and Tenant Screening

16. **What triggers the official “activation” of a property—does it require signoff from multiple departments, or just the property manager?**
17. **Can you describe your tenant screening criteria, and who ultimately makes the leasing decision if there is more than one strong applicant?**
18. **How are lease negotiations managed when there is more than one interested tenant, and who has the authority to approve special terms or discounts?**

### Quality Checks and Internal Audits

19. **How is the compliance review integrated into the onboarding process—does it happen before or after a lease is signed?**
20. **What triggers a financial analyst review, and have there been instances where properties were rejected due to pricing or profitability concerns?**
21. **How does the IT department verify listings and internal data—is this a manual or automated process?**

### Exceptions and Special Cases

22. **How do you handle cases where a property requires special insurance coverage or has unique legal requirements?**
23. **What is the escalation process when standard onboarding steps can't be followed, or when exceptional landlord requests arise?**
24. **Can you share an example of a particularly challenging onboarding and how it was resolved?**

### Timing, Sequencing, and Communication

25. **Roughly how long does a full onboarding process take, from initial contact to tenant move-in? Where do you usually see delays?**
26. **How do you coordinate communication and hand-off points between regional offices, property managers, landlords, and support teams to ensure nothing falls through the cracks?**
27. **What role do your CRM or project management tools play in tracking progress and communicating status updates to stakeholders?**
28. **How frequently do you review and update this onboarding process to adapt to regulatory, market, or operational changes?**
