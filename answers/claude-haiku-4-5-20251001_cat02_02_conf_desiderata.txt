# Compliance Analysis: Loan Application Process

## Part 1: Normative Rules Violations

### **Case 1:  COMPLIANT**

**Analysis:**
-  Application Received (09:00)
-  Credit Check (09:30) — occurs before Risk Assessment
-  Risk Assessment (10:00) — occurs after Credit Check, before Loan Decision
-  Loan Decision: Approved (11:00) — follows Risk Assessment
-  Inform Applicant (13:00) — occurs after Loan Decision
-  Finalize Documentation (13:30) — occurs before Close Case (approved path)
-  Close Case (14:00) — final step

**Verdict:** No normative violations. Process follows the required sequence perfectly.

### **Case 2:  CRITICAL VIOLATIONS**

**Violations Identified:**

1. **Ordering Violation: Risk Assessment before Credit Check**
   - Timeline: Risk Assessment at 08:20  Credit Check at 09:00
   - **Rule Violated:** "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment"
   - **Severity:** CRITICAL — This violates the fundamental sequence constraint
   - **Impact:** Risk assessment was conducted without complete financial information from credit check

2. **Decision-Path Violation: Finalize Documentation after Rejection**
   - Timeline: Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30  Finalize Documentation at 10:00
   - **Rule Violated:** "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case"
   - **Severity:** CRITICAL — This directly contradicts the decision logic
   - **Impact:** Documentation finalization is inappropriate and unnecessary for rejected applications

**Verdict:** **SEVERE COMPLIANCE FAILURE** — Case 2 violates two fundamental normative constraints. Both violations indicate process breakdown and potential control failures.

### **Case 3:  COMPLIANT (with timing concerns)**

**Analysis:**
-  Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00)
-  Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00) — occurs before Risk Assessment (ordering correct)
-  Risk Assessment (2024-01-14 11:00) — occurs after Credit Check, before Loan Decision
-  Loan Decision: Approved (2024-01-14 12:00) — follows Risk Assessment
-  Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00) — occurs after Loan Decision
-  Finalize Documentation (2024-01-17 09:00) — occurs before Close Case (approved path)
-  Close Case (2024-01-17 10:00) — final step

**Verdict:** No normative violations. Despite timing issues (covered in Part 2), the sequence and decision logic are correct.

## Part 2: Desiderata Violations (Non-Strict Recommendations)

### **Case 1:  MEETS DESIDERATA**

| Desideratum | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Credit Check within 24 hours |  Met | 30 minutes after application |
| Inform Applicant within 48 hours |  Met | 4 hours after decision |
| Follow-up Call before closing |  Missing | Not recorded in event log |

**Assessment:** Case 1 is near-optimal. The only minor gap is the absence of a follow-up call, which is explicitly noted as optional ("encouraged—but not strictly required").

**Recommendation:** Implement follow-up call as a standard practice, but do not penalize this case severely.

---

### **Case 2:  MULTIPLE DESIDERATA FAILURES**

| Desideratum | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Credit Check within 24 hours |  Failed | 20 minutes after application — *actually MEETS this*  |
| Inform Applicant within 48 hours |  No record | No "Inform Applicant" activity logged |
| Follow-up Call before closing |  Missing | Not recorded |

**Critical Issue:** Case 2 lacks an "Inform Applicant" activity entirely, which is a **normative requirement** (not just a desideratum). This represents an additional compliance failure.

**Assessment:** Beyond the two critical normative violations, Case 2 also fails to properly inform the applicant of the rejection decision, which compounds the process failures.

---

### **Case 3:  MULTIPLE DESIDERATA VIOLATIONS**

| Desideratum | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Credit Check within 24 hours |  Failed | 49 hours after application (2024-01-12 09:00  2024-01-14 10:00) |
| Inform Applicant within 48 hours |  Failed | 78.25 hours after decision (2024-01-14 12:00  2024-01-16 15:00) |
| Follow-up Call before closing |  Missing | Not recorded in event log |

**Severity Assessment:**
- **Credit Check Delay:** 49 hours vs. recommended 24 hours = ~2x slower
  - Possible justification: Backlog during holiday period, third-party credit bureau delays, application complexity
  
- **Applicant Notification Delay:** 78.25 hours vs. recommended 48 hours = ~1.6x slower
  - Possible justification: Administrative scheduling, weekend delays (application on Thursday, notification on Saturday), internal approval workflows
  
- **No Follow-up Call:** Standard practice not followed, but explicitly optional

**Assessment:** Case 3 exhibits systematic delays in both the credit check and applicant notification phases. While not normatively forbidden, these represent concerning deviations from recommended practices that suggest process capacity or prioritization issues.

## Summary Table

| Case | Normative Violations | Severity | Desiderata Violations | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | None |  | Follow-up call missing |  Minor |
| **2** | • Risk Assessment before Credit Check<br>• Finalize Documentation after rejection<br>• Missing "Inform Applicant" |  Critical | Multiple timing issues + missing follow-up |  Compound failure |
| **3** | None |  | • Credit Check: 49 hrs (vs. 24 hrs)<br>• Inform Applicant: 78 hrs (vs. 48 hrs)<br>• Follow-up call missing |  Moderate |

## Recommended Actions

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Case 2:** Investigate the process breakdown. Correct the documentation finalization error, ensure the applicant is informed of rejection, and conduct root-cause analysis of the ordering violation.

### **Process Improvements:**
1. **Case 3 Pattern:** Review workflow to identify bottlenecks causing 2x delay in credit checks and 1.6x delay in applicant notifications. Implement SLAs with alerts.
2. **All Cases:** Systematize follow-up calls as a standard post-decision activity.
3. **All Cases:** Implement automated sequencing controls to prevent activities from occurring out of order (especially Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
