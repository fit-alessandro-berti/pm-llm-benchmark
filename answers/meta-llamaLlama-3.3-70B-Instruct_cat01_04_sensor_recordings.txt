**Pattern Analysis and Activity Labeling**

Upon reviewing the event log, we can identify distinct patterns or "phases" in the sensor readings that likely correspond to meaningful steps in a manufacturing process. The following sections outline the identified patterns, assigned labels, and the rationale behind each labeling decision.

### 1. Initialization/Idle Phase

- **Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
- **Characteristics:**
  - Low temperature (around 20°C)
  - Low pressure (1 bar)
  - Minimal vibration (0 Hz)
  - No material flow (0 units/s)
  - Tool position at 0 mm
  - Low energy consumption (around 0.50 kWh)
- **Label:** Idle/Setup
- **Rationale:** These events are characterized by minimal activity across all sensors, suggesting the machine is either idle or in a setup phase, preparing for the next operation.

### 2. High-Energy Operation Phase

- **Events:** 4, 5, 6
- **Characteristics:**
  - Rapid increase in temperature (up to 58°C)
  - Increase in pressure (1.5 bar)
  - Significant vibration (up to 38 Hz)
  - Material flow rate at 5 units/s
  - Tool position increasing (up to 10 mm)
  - High energy consumption (up to 3.00 kWh)
- **Label:** Cutting Metal
- **Rationale:** The rapid increase in temperature, pressure, and vibration, combined with the material flow and tool movement, suggests an intense operation like cutting metal.

### 3. Transition and Adjustment Phase

- **Events:** 7, 8
- **Characteristics:**
  - Decrease in temperature (to 40°C)
  - Increase in pressure (2 bar)
  - Reduction in vibration (10 Hz)
  - Lower material flow rate (2 units/s)
  - Tool position at 15 mm
  - Energy consumption at 2.00 kWh
- **Label:** Assembling Parts
- **Rationale:** The adjustment in temperature, pressure, and vibration, along with the tool position and material flow, indicates a transition to a less intense operation, possibly assembling parts.

### 4. High-Temperature Operation Phase

- **Events:** 9
- **Characteristics:**
  - High temperature (80°C)
  - High pressure (2 bar)
  - Significant vibration (50 Hz)
  - No material flow
  - Tool position unchanged (15 mm)
  - Very high energy consumption (5.00 kWh)
- **Label:** Welding
- **Rationale:** The high temperature, pressure, and vibration, coupled with high energy consumption and no material flow, are indicative of a welding operation.

### 5. Cooling and Reset Phase

- **Events:** 10
- **Characteristics:**
  - Temperature drops (to 30°C)
  - Pressure returns to normal (1 bar)
  - Minimal vibration (1 Hz)
  - No material flow
  - Tool position unchanged (15 mm)
  - Lower energy consumption (1.00 kWh)
- **Label:** Cooling Down
- **Rationale:** The decrease in temperature, pressure, and vibration suggests the machine is cooling down after a high-temperature operation, likely in preparation for the next step or shutdown.

### 6. Material Handling Phase

- **Events:** 11, 12
- **Characteristics:**
  - Stable temperature (25°C)
  - Normal pressure (1 bar)
  - Low vibration (5 Hz)
  - Material flow rate at 1 unit/s
  - Tool position adjusted (20 mm)
  - Moderate energy consumption (1.50 kWh, 1.60 kWh)
- **Label:** Packaging
- **Rationale:** The stable conditions, along with material flow and tool adjustment, suggest a phase focused on handling or packaging the product.

**Conclusion:**

Through the analysis of patterns in the event log, six distinct phases of manufacturing activities have been identified and labeled:

1. **Idle/Setup** - Preparation or idle state of the machine.
2. **Cutting Metal** - High-energy operation with significant temperature, pressure, and vibration increases.
3. **Assembling Parts** - Transition phase with adjusted temperature, pressure, and vibration levels.
4. **Welding** - High-temperature, high-pressure operation with significant vibration.
5. **Cooling Down** - Post-operation cooling phase.
6. **Packaging** - Material handling with stable conditions and tool adjustments.

Each label is assigned based on the characteristic patterns observed in the sensor readings, providing a logical deduction of the activities being performed during each phase of the manufacturing process.
