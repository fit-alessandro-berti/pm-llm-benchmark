Summary answer up front
- Normative (hard) violations: only Case 2 violates the strict rules.  
- Desiderata (soft) violations: Case 3 violates the timing recommendations (credit check and informing); Cases 1–3 all lack the optional Follow-up Call in the log (a recommended activity). Case 2 also omits the Inform Applicant step (this omission is a normative violation as well).

Details by case

Case 1
- Normative rules: Compliant.
  - Observed sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. All required ordering constraints satisfied.
  - No forbidden activity (e.g., finalize after rejection) present.
- Desiderata: Minor deviations
  - Credit Check within 24 hours? Yes (09:00  09:30).
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision? Yes (11:00  13:00).
  - Follow-up Call? Not present in the log — a recommended (not required) action was not performed.
- Possible interpretation / suggestions:
  - This is a good/clean case. To meet best practice fully, add an explicit Follow-up Call before close (if organizational policy prefers it) and log it.

Case 2
- Normative rules: Violations (multiple)
  1. Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check (08:20 Risk Assessment vs 09:00 Credit Check). This breaks the required ordering “Credit Check before Risk Assessment.”
  2. Finalize Documentation happens after a Loan Decision of Rejected (09:30 Decision (Rejected)  10:00 Finalize Documentation). Finalizing documentation after rejection is explicitly forbidden.
  3. Inform Applicant is missing entirely. The process must Inform Applicant after the Loan Decision; skipping that step violates the required sequence.
- Desiderata:
  - Credit Check timing: credit was done within 24 hours of application (08:00  09:00), so timing recommendation met.
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours: not applicable because Inform Applicant is missing (but this is a normative issue anyway).
  - Follow-up Call: missing (desideratum).
- Possible interpretations / justifications:
  - Data-entry or logging order issue: activities may have been performed in the correct order but logged out-of-order (e.g., Risk Assessment timestamp entered incorrectly). If logs are authoritative, however, this is a real process violation.
  - Acting on preliminary information: an analyst may have performed a preliminary risk screening before waiting for a full credit report; that still violates the stated rule unless the policy explicitly allows such a preliminary step.
  - Finalize after rejection: could be an administrative error (staff applied an approval workflow template by mistake), or the decision was changed after finalization but the log wasn’t updated to reflect a corrected finalization step. Either way, this must be corrected because it contradicts the hard rule.
- Recommended corrective actions:
  - Block Finalize Documentation when the recorded decision is Rejected (technical guardrail).
  - Make Inform Applicant a required event before Close Case (enforceable checkpoint).
  - Validate timestamps/order when ingesting logs; if logging delays cause out-of-order entries, add a reconciliation process or use event sequencing by a single authoritative timestamp source.

Case 3
- Normative rules: Compliant.
  - Observed sequence is correct: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk before Decision, Inform Applicant after Decision, Finalize then Close for an Approved loan.
- Desiderata (soft) violations:
  1. Credit Check too late relative to Application: Application 2024-01-12 09:00  Credit Check 2024-01-14 10:00 (more than 24 hours). This violates the preferred 24-hour target.
  2. Inform Applicant too late relative to Decision: Decision 2024-01-14 12:00  Inform Applicant 2024-01-16 15:00 (more than 48 hours). This violates the preferred 48-hour target.
  3. Follow-up Call: not present (recommended).
- Possible interpretations / justifications:
  - Delay in obtaining external credit data or third-party service unavailability caused the credit-check delay.
  - Resource constraints or backlog caused notification delays, or the applicant could not be reached promptly (multiple contact attempts not logged).
  - The missing Follow-up Call may be a conscious decision (considered unnecessary for this case) or simply not recorded.
- Suggested improvements:
  - Implement SLAs/alerts: trigger reminders when Credit Check not completed within 24 hours, and when Inform Applicant is not done within 48 hours of decision.
  - Capture attempted contacts in the log (to justify delays) or add a short “Contact Attempt” entry if the applicant is unreachable.
  - If delays are occasionally unavoidable due to third parties, capture the cause in the case notes so they are auditable.

Overall recommendations
- Enforce hard rules with system guards:
  - Prevent Risk Assessment before Credit Check (or at least flag it for mandatory review).
  - Forbid Finalize Documentation when decision = Rejected.
  - Require Inform Applicant activity before Close Case.
- For desiderata, implement monitoring and alerts rather than hard blocks:
  - SLA timers for Credit Check (24h) and Inform Applicant (48h) that generate warnings/escalations when missed.
  - Encourage logging of Follow-up Call (or a reason for skipping it) so omissions are visible but not treated as violations.
- Audit and reconciliation:
  - If logs can be entered out of chronological order, add a reconciliation step or record both event occurrence time and entry time to detect logging errors versus actual process deviations.

If you want, I can:
- Produce a short corrective action checklist for Case 2 to remediate the violations, or
- Draft precise system rules (validation checks and alerts) to enforce the normative constraints and the desiderata SLAs.
