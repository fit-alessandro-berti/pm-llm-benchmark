Based on the attributes listed, the following attributes could be considered sensitive for fairness analysis:

1. `case:citizen`:
	* This attribute represents whether a candidate is a citizen or not. This could be a sensitive attribute because it may influence hiring decisions, especially in countries with specific regulations or biases towards certain nationalities.
2. `case:gender`:
	* This attribute represents whether a candidate is male or female. Unfortunately, gender-based biases are still prevalent in many industries, making this attribute sensitive for fairness analysis.
3. `case:german speaking`:
	* This attribute represents whether a candidate speaks German or not. While not necessarily a sensitive attribute on its own, it may be relevant in a job interview setting where German language skills are required.
4. `case:religious`:
	* This attribute represents whether a candidate has a certain religious affiliation or not. While not typically considered a sensitive attribute in hiring decisions, it's essential to note that religious biases can occur.
5. `resource`:
	* This attribute represents the resource or interviewer involved in the hiring process. It may be relevant for fairness analysis, especially if certain resources have different interview styles, biases, or discriminatory tendencies.

It's essential to analyze these attributes in the context of the entire process and the company's policies to determine which ones are genuinely sensitive for fairness. Additionally, consider conducting a thorough analysis using fairness metrics and techniques, such as:

* Disparate Impact Analysis (DIA)
* Equality of Opportunity (EOP)
* Demographic Parity (DP)
* Bias Mitigation techniques

These methods can help identify potential biases and disparities in the hiring process, allowing you to take corrective actions and ensure a fair and inclusive environment.
