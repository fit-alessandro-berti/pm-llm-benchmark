 In the context of fairness in process mining, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially be used to discriminate against certain groups. These are often related to protected characteristics like race, gender, age, religion, and nationality.

In the given attributes, the following appear to be potential sensitive attributes for fairness:

1. `case:gender`: This attribute refers to the gender of the job applicant. Discrimination based on gender is illegal in many jurisdictions and could lead to unfair outcomes in the hiring process.

2. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen or not. Discrimination based on citizenship status could also lead to unfair outcomes.

3. `case:religious`: This attribute refers to the applicant's religious beliefs. Discrimination based on religion is also illegal in many places and could lead to unfair outcomes.

4. `case:german speaking`: While not necessarily a protected characteristic in all contexts, this attribute could potentially be used in a discriminatory manner, especially if German language skills are not necessary for the job.
