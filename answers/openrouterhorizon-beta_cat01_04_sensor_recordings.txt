Here’s a concise process-oriented interpretation of the event log, grouping events into phases and assigning activity labels based on characteristic sensor patterns.

Activity A: Idle/Standby (System Ready)
Events: 1–3, 13–15
Signature: Low temperature (~20–21°C), low pressure (1 bar), no vibration (0 Hz), no material flow (0), tool at home (0 mm), minimal energy (0.40–0.50 kWh).
Rationale: Classic idle baseline before and after operations; no motion, no load, low energy.

Activity B: Cutting/Material Feed-In
Events: 4–6
Signature: Rapid rise in temperature (5058°C), moderate pressure (1–1.5 bar), increasing vibration (3038 Hz), steady material flow (5 units/s), tool advancing (510 mm), energy rising (2.03.0 kWh).
Rationale: Cutting typically shows elevated temperature and vibration from tool-workpiece contact, with material flow and tool movement as the cut progresses.

Activity C: Positioning/Fixturing for Assembly or Weld
Events: 7–8
Signature: Temperature moderate (40°C), pressure higher (2 bar), low vibration (10 Hz), reduced flow (2 units/s), tool at a fixed advanced position (15 mm), stable energy (~2.0 kWh).
Rationale: Indicates clamping/fixturing and precise positioning: higher pressure for clamps/fixtures, low dynamic loads, stable readings.

Activity D: Welding/Heat-Intensive Operation
Event: 9
Signature: Sharp temperature spike (80°C), high vibration (50 Hz), pressure stable (2 bar), zero material flow, tool held at 15 mm, high energy (5.0 kWh).
Rationale: Welding is heat- and energy-intensive; flow stops, tool remains in position, vibration increases from power equipment and cooling fans.

Activity E: Cooling/Depressurization and Unclamp
Event: 10
Signature: Temperature drops to 30°C, pressure back to 1 bar, minimal vibration (1 Hz), no flow, tool still at 15 mm, low energy (1.0 kWh).
Rationale: Post-weld cool-down and pressure release; low activity but not yet returning tool to home.

Activity F: Quality Inspection/Measurement
Events: 11–12
Signature: Low temperature (25°C), pressure 1 bar, light vibration (5 Hz), small material flow (1 unit/s), tool advances slightly (to 20 mm), modest energy (1.5–1.6 kWh).
Rationale: Inspection or probing often has small tool motions, low loads, and stable conditions; slight flow could be air purge or measurement coolant.

Overall inferred process flow:
Idle  Cutting/Feed-In  Positioning/Fixturing  Welding  Cooling/Unclamp  Inspection  Idle

Notes on transitions:
- The onset of Cutting is clearly marked by concurrent increases in temperature, vibration, tool movement, and energy (Events 4–6).
- The shift to Positioning shows reduced dynamics with higher pressure for clamping and stable tool position (Events 7–8).
- Welding stands out as a single high-energy, high-temperature spike with no material flow (Event 9).
- Cooling/Unclamp reduces temperature/pressure quickly (Event 10).
- Inspection exhibits light activity and precise tool motion with modest energy (Events 11–12).
- Finally, the system returns to the Idle baseline (Events 13–15).
