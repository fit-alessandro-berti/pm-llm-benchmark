# Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process Analysis

## 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

### Resolution Time Summary:

| Case ID | Total Duration | Status |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| 101     | 2 hours 15 min |  Fast |
| 102     | 24 hours 10 min |  **DELAYED** |
| 103     | 1 hour 20 min |  Fast |
| 104     | 23 hours 10 min |  **DELAYED** |
| 105     | 48 hours 5 min |  **CRITICAL** |

**Average Resolution Time:** 19.6 hours  
**Median Resolution Time:** 2 hours 15 min

**Outliers Identified:**
- **Case 105:** 48+ hours (2.5x average) - **CRITICAL**
- **Case 104:** 23+ hours (12x average) - **SEVERE**
- **Case 102:** 24+ hours (11x average) - **SEVERE**

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### **Pattern 1: Escalations Correlate with Delays**

| Case | Escalated? | Duration | Key Insight |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 101 | No | 2h 15m | Resolved at Level-1 |
| 102 | Yes | 24h 10m | Escalation introduced delays |
| 103 | No | 1h 20m | Resolved at Level-1 |
| 104 | No | 23h 10m | No escalation, but still delayed |
| 105 | Yes | 48h 5m | Multiple delays + escalation |

**Finding:** All escalated cases (102, 105) experienced significant delays. However, case 104 (non-escalated) also shows delay, suggesting escalation is **one factor among several**.

---

### **Pattern 2: Excessive Wait Times Between Activities**

Analyzing gaps between consecutive activities:

#### **Case 102 - Critical Gap:**
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:00
- ** Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 11:30**  **2.5-hour gap** (no investigation occurred)
- ** Investigate Issue: 14:00**  **2.5-hour post-escalation gap**

**Issue:** Escalation triggered at 11:30 but investigation didn't commence until 14:00—a 2.5-hour handoff delay.

#### **Case 104 - Suspicious Gap:**
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:30
- ** Investigate Issue: 13:00**  **3.5-hour gap**
- ** Resolve Ticket: 08:00 (next day)**  **19-hour investigation period**

**Issue:** Long delay before investigation begins, then unusually extended investigation phase.

#### **Case 105 - Multiple Critical Gaps:**
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 10:00
- ** Investigate Issue (again): 14:00 (next day)**  **28-hour gap**
- ** Resolve Ticket: 09:00 (day 3)**  **19-hour investigation**

**Issue:** 28-hour delay after escalation before reinvestigation—longest gap in the dataset.

#### **Cases 101 & 103 - Optimal Performance:**
- All activities complete within 10-30 minute windows
- No unexplained gaps
- Both resolved in under 2.5 hours

---

### **Pattern 3: Re-Investigation After Escalation**

**Case 105 Anomaly:**
- Investigate Issue: 09:10 (Level-1)
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 10:00
- **Investigate Issue (again): 14:00 next day** (Level-2)

**Finding:** Investigation was partially completed at Level-1, then restarted at Level-2. This suggests:
- Incomplete handoff documentation
- Loss of context between levels
- Duplication of effort

## 3. Performance Bottlenecks & Root Causes

### **Primary Bottlenecks Identified:**

| Bottleneck | Impact | Cases Affected | Severity |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Extended post-assignment waiting** | 3.5-19 hours before investigation | 102, 104, 105 | CRITICAL |
| **Escalation handoff delays** | 2.5-28 hours between escalation and action | 102, 105 | CRITICAL |
| **Duplicated investigation efforts** | Rework and extended resolution | 105 | HIGH |
| **Overnight processing gaps** | Work halted overnight; resumes next business day | 102, 104, 105 | MEDIUM |

---

## 4. Insights & Recommendations

### **Insight 1: Escalation Process Breakdown**
**Problem:** Escalations introduce ~2.5+ hour handoffs with no parallel work occurring.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement **warm handoffs**: Level-1 agent briefs Level-2 agent in real-time with complete issue notes
- Use **shared ticketing system** to eliminate information loss
- Set **SLA for escalation acknowledgment** (target: <30 min)

---

### **Insight 2: Assignment-to-Investigation Gap**
**Problem:** 3.5-19 hour delays occur between assignment and investigation commencement.

**Recommendation:**
- Investigate **agent workload/availability**: Are agents overloaded?
- Implement **automatic escalation rule**: If investigation doesn't begin within 30 minutes, escalate or reassign
- Add **queue management analytics** to identify bottlenecks

---

### **Insight 3: Rework Due to Re-Investigation**
**Problem:** Case 105 shows investigation restarted after escalation (wasted effort).

**Recommendation:**
- Standardize **investigation documentation templates** to ensure Level-2 understands Level-1's findings
- Add **mandatory investigation notes** before escalation approval
- Create **escalation criteria checklist** to prevent incomplete escalations

---

### **Insight 4: Overnight Processing Gaps**
**Problem:** All three delayed cases have timestamp jumps from end-of-day to next morning.

**Recommendation:**
- **24/7 Level-2 support** for high-priority tickets (if feasible)
- **Batch overnight escalations**: Queue them for first-thing-morning processing
- Consider **shift coverage analysis** to identify staffing gaps

---

### **Insight 5: Level-1 Capability Issues**
**Problem:** Cases 101 & 103 resolved at Level-1 in ~1-2 hours, while cases 102, 104, 105 required escalation or had extended timelines.

**Recommendation:**
- Conduct **root cause analysis on escalation triggers**: Are Level-1 agents adequately trained?
- Implement **Level-1 skill gap training** targeting common escalation causes
- Track **escalation ratios by agent** to identify training needs

## Summary Table: Action Items

| Priority | Action | Expected Impact | Timeline |
|----------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Implement warm handoff protocol for escalations | Reduce handoff delay from 2.5h to 30m | Week 1 |
| **CRITICAL** | Add investigation start SLA monitoring | Eliminate 3.5-19h pre-investigation gaps | Week 1 |
| **HIGH** | Standardize escalation documentation | Eliminate 28h re-investigation delays | Week 2 |
| **HIGH** | Analyze Level-1 training & workload | Improve first-contact resolution rate | Week 2-3 |
| **MEDIUM** | Evaluate 24/7 coverage needs | Eliminate overnight processing gaps | Month 1 |

---

**Expected Outcome:** Implementing these recommendations could reduce average resolution time from 19.6 hours to **under 4 hours**, achieving performance parity with fast-track cases 101 and 103.
