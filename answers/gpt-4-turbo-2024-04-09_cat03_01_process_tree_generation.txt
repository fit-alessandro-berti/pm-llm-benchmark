Let's build the process tree according to the described complex hospital patient management workflow. For simplicity, we will break down each step and combine them using the respective operators and activities described.

We begin by constructing the hierarchy of activities and decisions:

1. Patient Arrival Workflow:
   - Process begins with Arrival (`A`), Registration (`RG`), and Intake Assessment (`IA`), executed in sequence.

2. Triage Evaluation:
   - Sequence of Triage Interview (`TI`) followed by Triage Classification (`TC`).

3. Initial Diagnostic Test Decision:
   - Exclusive choice between Comprehensive ECG (`CE`) and Full Blood Panel (`FBP`).

4. Specialist Consultation and Treatment Loop:
   - After the initial diagnostic:
     - Specialist Consultation (`SC`),
     - Exclusive choice for treatment between Targeted Medication (`TM`) and Specialized Physical Therapy (`SPT`),
     - Re-diagnostic Test which is an exclusive choice between Follow-up ECG (`FCE`) and Follow-up Blood Analysis (`FBA`).
   - This forms a loop (repeats until abnormal results become normal).

5. Post-normal Result Activities:
   - Advanced Imaging (`AI`) and Nutritional Counseling (`NC`), executed in true concurrency.

6. Discharge Preparations:
   - Follow-up Appointment Scheduling (`FAS`) and Detailed Discharge Instructions (`DDI`), executed in sequence.

7. Final Administrative Tasks:
   - Billing (`BL`), Insurance Claims Processing (`ICP`), and Medical Records Finalization (`MRF`), executed in true concurrency.

Now, let's translate the above descriptions into ProcessTree constructions using the Python library pm4py objects:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define leaf activities
A = ProcessTree(label="A")
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG")
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA")
TI = ProcessTree(label="TI")
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC")
CE = ProcessTree(label="CE")
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP")
SC = ProcessTree(label="SC")
TM = ProcessTree(label="TM")
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT")
FCE = ProcessTree(label="FCE")
FBA = ProcessTree(label="FBA")
AI = ProcessTree(label="AI")
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC")
FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS")
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI")
BL = ProcessTree(label="BL")
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP")
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF")

# Building the process tree structure
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Early steps sequence
initial_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[A, RG, IA])

# Triage sequence
triage_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[TI, TC])

# Diagnostic exclusive choice
diag_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CE, FBP])

# Loop for specialist consultation and treatment
treatment_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[TM, SPT])
rdt_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[FCE, FBA])
loop_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[SC, treatment_choice, rdt_choice])
treatment_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[loop_seq])

# Concurrency after normal results
post_normal = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[AI, NC])

# Final steps sequence
final_steps = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[FAS, DDI])

# Final administrative tasks
final_admin = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[BL, ICP, MRF])

# Combining all major sections into the root sequence
root.children = [initial_seq, triage_seq, diag_choice, treatment_loop, post_normal, final_steps, final_admin]

# Ensuring all children have correct parent set
def set_parent(parent):
    for child in parent.children:
        child.parent = parent
        set_parent(child)

set_parent(root)
```

This Python construction represents the process tree for the complex hospital patient management system, using the `pm4py` library classes. Each node is either a process, a choice, a concurrency, a loop, or a simple sequence. The relationships reflect the sequences, decisions, and concurrent activities described in the prompt.
