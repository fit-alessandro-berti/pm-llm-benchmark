# Bias Analysis: Comparing Group A and Group B Event Logs

## Executive Summary

**Group B's log exhibits clear, systematic bias** through a preferential score adjustment mechanism that advantages local residents affiliated with specific community groups — advantages entirely unavailable to Group A applicants, regardless of their underlying creditworthiness.

---

## 1. Structural Differences Between the Two Logs

### Group A (Protected Group)
| Attribute | Observed Values |
|-----------|----------------|
| LocalResident | Always **FALSE** |
| CommunityGroup | Always **None** |
| ScoreAdjustment | Always **0** |
| Score used in decision | Raw preliminary score, unchanged |

### Group B (Unprotected Group)
| Attribute | Observed Values |
|-----------|----------------|
| LocalResident | Always **TRUE** |
| CommunityGroup | "Highland Civic Darts Club" or None |
| ScoreAdjustment | **+10 (Community Boost)** when affiliated; 0 otherwise |
| Score used in decision | Adjusted score (inflated by +10 for affiliated members) |

---

## 2. How the Bias Manifests

### 2.1 The Community Boost Mechanism

The most direct evidence of bias is the **"+10 Community Boost"** applied exclusively to Group B applicants who belong to the Highland Civic Darts Club:

```
U001: 720 (raw)  730 (adjusted)  Approved
U003: 695 (raw)  705 (adjusted)  Approved
```

Group A applicants receive **no equivalent adjustment**, regardless of any attributes they may hold. Their scores enter and exit the process unchanged.

### 2.2 The Critical Comparison — U003 vs. P002

This is the most revealing comparison in the dataset:

| Case | Group | Raw Score | Adjustment | Final Score | Decision |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| P002 | A (Protected) | 710 | 0 | 710 | **Rejected** |
| U003 | B (Unprotected) | 695 | +10 | 705 | **Approved** |

> **U003 had a lower raw score than P002 (695 vs. 710), yet received approval while P002 was rejected.**

This directly demonstrates that **community group affiliation — not actual creditworthiness — is determining outcomes**. A Group A applicant with objectively stronger financials is rejected while a Group B applicant with weaker financials is approved, solely due to the score adjustment.

### 2.3 The Compounding Role of LocalResident Status

The `LocalResident = TRUE` attribute in Group B is perfectly correlated with both community group access and the boost mechanism. This suggests that:

1. **LocalResident status is a gateway** to community group membership eligibility
2. **Community group membership is a gateway** to the score boost
3. Group A applicants, being non-local residents (`FALSE`), are **structurally excluded** from this entire benefit pathway

This creates a **two-layer exclusion mechanism**:

```
Non-Local Resident (Group A)
     Cannot access CommunityGroup affiliation
             Cannot receive ScoreAdjustment
                     Evaluated solely on raw score
                    
Local Resident (Group B)
     Can access CommunityGroup affiliation
             Eligible for +10 ScoreAdjustment
                     Evaluated on inflated score
```

### 2.4 Manual Review Does Not Correct the Bias

Notably, the **Underwriter (Manual Review)** stage does not neutralize the boost — it accepts the adjusted score as-is:

- U001's underwriter reviews the case at **730 (Adjusted)**, not 720
- U003's underwriter reviews the case at **705 (Adjusted)**, not 695

This means human oversight is not functioning as a corrective check. The bias is **institutionalized through the workflow itself**, not just introduced at one step.

## 3. Systematic Pattern of Disparate Impact

| Metric | Group A | Group B |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Approval rate | 2/3 (67%) | 2/3 (67%) |
| Cases boosted by community adjustment | 0/3 (0%) | 2/3 (67%) |
| Lowest approved raw score | 720 | **695** |
| Average effective score benefit | +0 | +6.67 pts |

> While approval *rates* appear equal on the surface, this masks the underlying inequity: **Group B applicants are approved at lower raw thresholds** than Group A applicants can ever achieve through merit alone.

---

## 4. Why This Constitutes Bias

### Procedural Unfairness
The scoring rules are **not applied uniformly**. A score adjustment exists in the process that is structurally inaccessible to the protected group, violating the principle of consistent treatment.

### Proxy Discrimination
Even if `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` appear facially neutral, they function as **proxies for group membership**. If non-local residency is correlated with protected characteristics (e.g., national origin, ethnicity, immigration status), then these criteria produce **disparate impact discrimination**.

### Outcome Distortion
The process no longer measures what it claims to measure (creditworthiness/merit). It measures **creditworthiness + social capital from a specific local network**, and only the unprotected group can accumulate that social capital within this system.

---

## 5. Recommendations

1. **Eliminate or universalize the Community Boost** — either remove it entirely or make equivalent adjustments available to all applicants through transparent, equally accessible criteria
2. **Audit the LocalResident attribute** — determine whether its use as a gateway to benefits has disparate impact on protected groups
3. **Empower manual reviewers** to flag and correct score adjustments that introduce group-based inequities
4. **Establish a minimum raw score floor** — decisions should be cross-checked against unadjusted scores to ensure no applicant is approved/rejected purely on the basis of non-merit adjustments

---

## Conclusion

The bias in this system is **not incidental — it is structural**. The combination of `LocalResident` status, `CommunityGroup` affiliation, and the `ScoreAdjustment` mechanism creates a systematic advantage for Group B applicants that has **no equivalent counterpart for Group A**. The most damning evidence is case U003: an applicant approved with a raw score of 695 while a Group A applicant with a raw score of 710 (P002) is rejected. The process, as designed, **does not evaluate all applicants on equal terms**.
