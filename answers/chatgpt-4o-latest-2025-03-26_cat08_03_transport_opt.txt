## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### a) Data Integration & Preprocessing

To build a unified event log suitable for process mining, start by preprocessing and integrating the heterogeneous data sources as follows:

#### Key Steps:
- **Define a consistent Case ID:** In this scenario, "Vehicle-Day" (e.g., V12-20241205) acts as a unique Case ID representing a delivery round.
- **Determine Event Granularity:** Each event should represent a meaningful activity (e.g., “Depart Depot”, “Arrive Customer”, “Delivery Success”, “Unscheduled Stop”).
- **Establish ordering via timestamps:** Ensure all events are consistently timestamped and aligned across systems using a uniform format (e.g., ISO 8601).
- **Add semantic labels:** Each row should have defined fields: `case ID`, `activity`, `timestamp`, `resource` (driver ID), `vehicle ID`, `location`, contextual data (e.g., speed, notes).

#### Integration Challenges:
- **Data Synchronization:** Different data sources may exhibit slight timestamp misalignments or time zone inconsistencies. Use log alignment algorithms and temporal heuristics to correct.
- **Missing or inconsistent data:** GPS tracker data may be incomplete due to signal loss; scanner logs might be manually delayed. Use data imputation or anomaly detection to handle gaps.
- **Event duplication/conflicts:** Ensure sequential consistency and remove/minimize redundant logging (e.g., multiple low-speed readings during traffic jams).

### b) Process Discovery: Mapping the Actual Delivery Flow

Using tools like Celonis, Disco (Fluxicon), or ProM:

- Apply automated discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristic Miner) to visualize the end-to-end delivery flow for each vehicle-day.
- Capture sequences like: 
  Depot  Route Assigned  Depart Depot  [Arrive Customer  Delivery  Depart Customer]*  Return to Depot

Enhancements:
- Use enriched event logs to tag delays (e.g., low GPS speed, long dwell time).
- Visualize activity durations and frequency of optional paths (like “Unscheduled Stops” or “Delivery Failed”).

---

### c) Conformance Checking Against Planned Routes

Compare process models derived from the dispatch system (planned routes and time windows) against actual process models to:

#### Identify Key Deviations:
- **Skipped or reordered stops:** Actual delivery sequence diverges from planned route.
- **Unscheduled Stops:** 'Unplanned activities' such as breaks, technical faults.
- **Violations of time windows:** Delivery occurs outside customer-requested periods.
- **Extra travel/mileage:** Detect cases where path deviations or detours occurred.

Use alignment-based conformance techniques to quantify:
- Fitness (how closely actual matches plan),
- Precision (extra steps in actual journey),
- Generalization (consistency across cases), and
- Performance (duration/delay at each activity).

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### a) Relevant KPIs and Their Computation

1. **On-Time Delivery Rate:**  
   % of deliveries completed within planned or customer-specified time windows;  
    Use 'Arrive Customer' & planned windows from dispatch logs.

2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop:**  
   (Depart Previous Customer  Arrive  Delivery Completion  Depart)  
    Analyze per stop and aggregate across vehicle-day or route.

3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:**  
   Sum of transit durations vs. time spent at delivery points;  
    Helps assess driver efficiency vs. external constraints.

4. **Fuel Consumption per km/package:**  
   If fuel data is available or indirectly estimated from vehicle model + route length;  
    Normalize fuel by distance or deliveries made.

5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate:**  
   Time spent in active delivery vs. total shift duration;  
    From vehicle GPS + driver activity data.

6. **Traffic Delay Incidence and Duration:**  
   Identify 'Low Speed Detected' events not linked to stop points;  
    Map to known traffic hotspots or times (AM peak).

7. **Failed Delivery Rate:**  
   % of visits resulting in failed delivery (e.g., “Customer Not Home”)  
    Calculated from scanner logs.

---

### b) Bottleneck Identification Techniques

Use visual and statistical methods:

- **Process Maps with Performance Overlays:** Average duration and frequency annotated on process activities and transitions.
- **Time-Based Filtering:** Segment by time-of-day or day-of-week to isolate rush hour delays.
- **Geo-Spatial Analysis:** Overlay delivery efficiency (e.g., stop durations, failed attempts) on a city map to identify problematic zones.
- **Driver Benchmarking:** Compare KPIs across drivers on similar routes using variant analysis.
- **Clustering & Outlier Detection:** Spot high-deviation days (e.g., long delivery duration, high idle time) via clustering algorithms.

Quantifying Bottlenecks:
- Calculate cumulative delay per activity/resource/location.
- Rank top 10 bottleneck segments using mean/median time spent and frequency.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

After identifying inefficiencies, root cause analysis focuses on “why” they occur:

### a) Common Root Causes

1. **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
   - Evidence: Routes with high deviation vs. optimal paths, redundant driving.
   - Cause: Static routing not accounting for real-time traffic or road restrictions.

2. **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
   - Evidence: High variance between estimated vs. actual journey times.
   - Cause: Outdated estimates, especially in urban congestion.

3. **Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
   - Evidence: Repeated “Low Speed” events in specific areas or time periods.
   - Link with city traffic heatmaps or open traffic APIs (e.g., Google Maps API historic data).

4. **Customer Service Time Variability:**
   - Evidence: High standard deviation in 'Arrive  Depart Customer' durations.
   - Possible causes: Difficult access, long dialogues, complex deliveries.

5. **Vehicle Breakdowns / Maintenance Interruptions:**
   - Evidence: ‘Unscheduled Stop’ events correlated with maintenance logs.
   - Impact: Delivery delays, rerouting.

6. **Driver Behavior Differences:**
   - Evidence: Driver X consistently slower with same route/vehicle.
   - Cause: Lack of training, risk aversion, route familiarity.

7. **High Rate of Delivery Failures:**
   - Evidence: Many 'Delivery Failed' events at certain customers/time windows.
   - Cause: Poor customer availability prediction, time window mismatch.

---

### b) Process Mining Analyses to Validate

- **Variant Analysis:** Compare frequent delivery process variants—for example, fast vs. slow deliveries, successful vs. failed delivery sequences.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Traffic patterns correlated with late deliveries.
- **Dwell Time Distributions:** Analyze durations between 'Arrive Customer' and 'Depart Customer' per zone, customer type.
- **Shift-Level Timeline Views:** Visual timeline for vehicle/day showing idle/gap durations, late starts, unplanned stops.
- **Cross-case Analysis:** Check if repeated issues are tied to specific package types, delivery areas, or weather events.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Below are three specific, actionable recommendations supported by process mining insights:

---

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Based on Real-Time and Historical Traffic Insights

-  Issue: Delivery delays due to static route plans ignoring congestion.
-  Root Cause: High clustering of ‘Low Speed’ events in known hotspots.
-  Data Support: GPS logs with low speeds repeatedly occurring in specific city zones during peak hours.

 Solution:
- Implement dynamic routing that adjusts for real-time traffic and road conditions.
- Integrate historical traffic patterns from six-month data to improve ETA modeling.

 KPI Impact:
-  On-Time Delivery Rate
-  Fuel Consumption (avoiding start-stop driving)
-  Idle and travel time per stop

---

### Strategy 2: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling

-  Issue: Unscheduled vehicle stops during delivery shifts due to breakdowns.
-  Root Cause: Ad-hoc vehicle servicing linked temporally to delivery delay spikes.
-  Data Support: Maintenance logs aligned with GPS events (e.g., "Unscheduled Stop – Engine Warning Light").

 Solution:
- Use usage patterns (e.g., km/day, idling time) and frequent breakdown precursors to predict maintenance windows.
- Schedule preventive maintenance during low utilization periods.

 KPI Impact:
-  Vehicle downtime per shift
-  Late deliveries from halted routes
-  Vehicle utilization rate

---

### Strategy 3: Targeted Driver Behavior Coaching Program

-  Issue: High delivery time variability and missed time windows across drivers.
-  Root Cause: Drivers differ in parking habits, scanning time, and route knowledge.
-  Data Support: Variant analysis of 'Arrive  Delivery Success  Depart' time by driver, normalized by stop.

 Solution:
- Use performance benchmarks (e.g., avg. time per stop, % on-time deliveries) to identify outliers.
- Design coaching modules focused on parking optimization, customer interaction, and device efficiency.

 KPI Impact:
-  Uniform delivery service time
-  On-Time Delivery Rate
-  Customer satisfaction

## 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

### a) Addressing Operational Constraints

1. **Driver Working Hours:**
   - Ensure dynamic routing and optimization algorithms do not generate shifts exceeding regulated driver hours (rest break rules, overtime thresholds).

2. **Vehicle Capacities:**
   - Confirm that optimized delivery sequences respect package volume/weight constraints per vehicle.

3. **Customer Time Windows:**
   - Include as hard constraints in routing logic or assign priority levels (e.g., medical supplies).

Tools like vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers can be parameterized with these constraints drawing inputs from the enriched event logs.

---

### b) Continuous Monitoring Plan

Set up dashboards for ongoing visibility using process mining tools (Celonis, UiPath Process Mining, etc.):

#### Views:
- End-to-end delivery process model with real-time alerts for bottlenecks.
- Daily driver shift timeline views to spot long dwell periods or route deviations.
- Geographic map visualization of failed vs. successful deliveries.

#### Key Monitoring KPIs:
- % On-Time Deliveries (daily trend)
- Average travel time per zone
- # Unscheduled maintenance events
- Stop-level service time distribution
- Failed delivery heatmap (by time slot)

Alerts can be configured for:
- Spikes in delivery time deviation
- Surge in failed delivery attempts
- Sudden drop in vehicle performance metrics

Dashboards should enable decision-makers and team leads to take corrective actions rapidly and support a culture of continuous improvement.
