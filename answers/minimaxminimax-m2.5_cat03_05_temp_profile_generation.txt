The user wants a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile (average and standard deviation) for pairs of activities in a global supply chain process. They have described a scenario of a high-tech electronics supply chain with 10 activities: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS.

They want us to produce a dictionary mapping each pair of activities that appear in this process (i.e., all pairs that could appear in any trace, not just direct adjacency), to a tuple of (average_time, standard_deviation). They specifically say: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." Wait that seems contradictory: they want us to assign an estimated average time and standard deviation, but they say "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." Actually they want the LLM (the model) to estimate the times based on the scenario and typical durations for those steps. So we need to output a dictionary with realistic estimated times.

We need to include a representative subset of these activity pairs, ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps.

Thus we need to include pairs for each possible combination of two distinct activities (i.e., any earlier activity can be before later activity). They want to consider all pairs that eventually follow each other in at least one execution. The scenario implies all activities can appear in any order? Usually supply chain may have linear order: SS -> OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT -> AS. That is typical linear. But there could be other orders? However, they say "consider pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps". So we can consider all pairs (i,j) where i appears before j in the process. That yields many pairs: 10 activities produce 10*9/2 = 45 pairs (ordered by time). They ask to include a representative subset, not all. So maybe we can include some subset representing typical times for each step. Let's produce about 30-40 pairs.

The dictionary keys: tuples of activity labels, e.g., ('SS','OP'), ('SS','RC'), etc. The values: tuple of (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds. Provide realistic numbers: e.g., Supplier selection maybe a few days: average 3 days (259200 sec) with std 1 day (86400). Order Placement maybe 0.5 days (43200 sec) with std 0.2 days (17280). Receiving components may take 1 day (86400) with std 0.5 days (43200). Quality inspection maybe 2 days (172800) with std 0.5 days (43200). Component assembly maybe 5 days (432000) with std 1 day (86400). Product testing maybe 3 days (259200) with std 1 day (86400). Packaging maybe 1 day (86400) with std 0.25 days (21600). Warehouse storage maybe 2 days (172800) with std 0.5 days (43200). Distribution maybe 3 days (259200) with std 0.75 days (64800). After-sales support could be indefinite, but maybe average 30 days (2592000) with std 10 days (864000). But we must consider pairs that are separated by multiple steps: e.g., SS to CA maybe average time = sum of average times of intermediate steps: SS->OP + OP->RC + RC->QI + QI->CA. But they'd like to estimate average times for each pair individually based on typical time it takes from the first activity to the second (including possible intermediate steps). We can approximate like: SS->CA average = maybe 10 days (864000) with std maybe 2 days (172800). Similarly, SS->PT maybe 13 days (1123200) with std 3 days (259200). Also RC->PT includes QA + CA + PT times. But perhaps they want a simple dictionary with each pair having an average and std. We could produce a dictionary that includes pairs like:

- SS -> OP: average = 3 days (259200), std = 1 day (86400)
- SS -> RC: average = 5 days (432000), std = 1.5 days (129600)
- SS -> QI: average = 7 days (604800), std = 2 days (172800)
- SS -> CA: average = 12 days (1036800), std = 3 days (259200)
- SS -> PT: average = 15 days (1296000), std = 4 days (345600)
- SS -> PK: average = 16 days (1382400), std = 4.5 days (388800)
- SS -> WS: average = 17 days (1468800), std = 5 days (432000)
- SS -> DT: average = 20 days (1728000), std = 5.5 days (475200)
- SS -> AS: average = 30 days (2592000), std = 10 days (864000)

Similarly for OP -> RC: maybe 2 days (172800) with std 0.5 days (43200). OP -> QI: 4 days (345600) with std 1 day (86400). OP -> CA: 9 days (777600) with std 2 days (172800). OP -> PT: 12 days (1036800) with std 3 days (259200). OP -> PK: 13 days (1123200) with std 3.5 days (302400). OP -> WS: 14 days (1209600) with std 4 days (345600). OP -> DT: 17 days (1468800) with std 4.5 days (388800). OP -> AS: 27 days (2332800) with std 9 days (777600).

And so forth. Then for RC -> QI: 1 day (86400) with std 0.5 days (43200). RC -> CA: 6 days (518400) with std 1.5 days (129600). RC -> PT: 9 days (777600) with std 2 days (172800). RC -> PK: 10 days (864000) with std 2.5 days (216000). RC -> WS: 11 days (950400) with std 3 days (259200). RC -> DT: 14 days (1209600) with std 3.5 days (302400). RC -> AS: 24 days (2073600) with std 8 days (691200).

Similarly QI -> CA: 5 days (432000) with std 1 day (86400). QI -> PT: 8 days (691200) with std 2 days (172800). QI -> PK: 9 days (777600) with std 2.5 days (216000). QI -> WS: 10 days (864000) with std 3 days (259200). QI -> DT: 13 days (1123200) with std 3.5 days (302400). QI -> AS: 23 days (1987200) with std 8 days (691200).

CA -> PT: 3 days (259200) with std 1 day (86400). CA -> PK: 4 days (345600) with std 1.5 days (129600). CA -> WS: 5 days (432000) with std 2 days (172800). CA -> DT: 8 days (691200) with std 2.5 days (216000). CA -> AS: 18 days (1555200) with std 7 days (604800).

PT -> PK: 1 day (86400) with std 0.5 days (43200). PT -> WS: 2 days (172800) with std 1 day (86400). PT -> DT: 5 days (432000) with std 1.5 days (129600). PT -> AS: 15 days (1296000) with std 6 days (518400).

PK -> WS: 1 day (86400) with std 0.5 days (43200). PK -> DT: 4 days (345600) with std 1 day (86400). PK -> AS: 14 days (1209600) with std 5 days (432000).

WS -> DT: 3 days (259200) with std 1 day (86400). WS -> AS: 13 days (1123200) with std 5 days (432000).

DT -> AS: 10 days (864000) with std 4 days (345600).

Now we need to ensure each tuple is (average_time, standard_deviation). Times should be in seconds. Provide the dictionary accordingly.

Given the complexity, we can produce a dictionary with all pairs sorted lexicographically maybe. Use proper formatting.

The instruction: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." Wait, but they've asked us to estimate. So we should produce numbers. We'll do that.

Make sure to note that these are approximated in seconds.

Thus answer: provide the dictionary as code block. Also maybe explain that it's approximate.

We'll produce dictionary with pairs in order: sorted by first element then second.

Potential key naming: Use uppercase activity codes exactly as defined: "SS", "OP", "RC", "QI", "CA", "PT", "PK", "WS", "DT", "AS".

Will include all pairs where earlier < later. So 45 pairs. Provide a representative subset: maybe all pairs for which typical times are distinct.

We must check that each pair is a tuple, like ('SS','OP'). Use parentheses correctly.

The dictionary could be assigned to variable `temporal_profile`.

We'll present in a Python code block.

Alright.

Potential note: The average times might be unrealistic for a global supply chain but that's okay as they ask for approximate.

Also we must reflect that standard deviations can be lower for short tasks and larger for long tasks.

Will include 45 pairs. Provide as dictionary.

Let's calculate each average and std.

I'll create baseline times for each activity relative to previous:

- SS: ~3 days (259200 sec)
- OP: ~0.5 days after SS (43200 sec)
- RC: ~1 day after OP (86400 sec)
- QI: ~2 days after RC (172800 sec)
- CA: ~5 days after QI (432000 sec)
- PT: ~3 days after CA (259200 sec)
- PK: ~1 day after PT (86400 sec)
- WS: ~2 days after PK (172800 sec)
- DT: ~3 days after WS (259200 sec)
- AS: ~30 days after DT (2592000 sec) - indefinite but approximate.

We can then compute pair times as sum of the durations between each successive step.

But our dictionary may have cumulative values for longer distances.

Alternatively we could compute each pair by summing durations and adding some variability.

But easier: approximate values for each pair as described earlier. There's a pattern: as you go further, average and std increase roughly additive.

Thus produce dictionary accordingly.

But note: For pairs that are reversed (i.e., later activity to earlier activity), they are not considered because they cannot be after each other (no cycles). But they could maybe appear in logs with loops? The prompt: "for each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other)". Means only pairs where first can be before second. So we should include only pairs where first appears before second in typical process ordering. That's exactly the linear order as described: SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS.

Thus we can have all pairs where earlier index < later index. That's 45 pairs.

Now assign average times: Let durations be:

- d_SS_OP = 3 days (259200)
- d_OP_RC = 0.5 days (43200)
- d_RC_QI = 1 day (86400)
- d_QI_CA = 2 days (172800)
- d_CA_PT = 5 days (432000)
- d_PT_PK = 3 days (259200)
- d_PK_WS = 1 day (86400)
- d_WS_DT = 2 days (172800)
- d_DT_AS = 3 days (259200) ??? Actually after sales could be after distribution, maybe 30 days later but we can approximate.

But the earlier estimate uses each activity's time relative to previous, but it's not necessary. For each pair i<j we can compute cumulative sum of durations from i to j (including i? Actually average time between activity A and activity B is the average time difference between the occurrence of A and occurrence of B in the same trace, which includes time from after A to B. So if A is earlier step, time between A and B includes time for A to complete and then all intermediate steps up to B. But we can treat average difference between the start times maybe.

Anyway, we can approximate cumulatively: define cumulative sums:

- cum_SS = 0 (time of SS)
- cum_OP = d_SS_OP = 259200
- cum_RC = cum_OP + d_OP_RC = 259200+43200=302400
- cum_QI = cum_RC + d_RC_QI = 302400+86400=388800
- cum_CA = cum_QI + d_QI_CA = 388800+172800=561600
- cum_PT = cum_CA + d_CA_PT = 561600+432000=993600
- cum_PK = cum_PT + d_PT_PK = 993600+259200=1,252,800
- cum_WS = cum_PK + d_PK_WS = 1,252,800+86,400 = 1,339,200
- cum_DT = cum_WS + d_WS_DT = 1,339,200+172,800=1,512,000
- cum_AS = cum_DT + d_DT_AS? But d_DT_AS maybe 30 days (2,592,000). We'll choose approximate 30 days: 2,592,000. So cum_AS = 1,512,000 + 2,592,000 = 4,104,000.

Thus average time between activity i (earlier) and j (later) is cum_j - cum_i. For instance SS->OP: cum_OP - cum_SS = 259200 seconds. Good.

Now standard deviation: we can assign variability for each base duration, then propagate variance assuming independence: var_total = sum(var_i) where var_i = (stdev_i)^2. Then stdev_total = sqrt(var_total). If we define stdev for each base step: maybe 1 day for SS->OP, 0.2 days for OP->RC, 0.5 days for RC->QI, 1 day for QI->CA, 2 days for CA->PT, 1 day for PT->PK, 0.5 days for PK->WS, 1 day for WS->DT, 5 days for DT->AS. But we can approximate overall stdev for each pair as maybe sqrt of sum of squares of individual stdevs. Let's compute.

Define base stdev:

- stdev_SS_OP: 1 day = 86400 sec.
- stdev_OP_RC: 0.2 days = 17280 sec.
- stdev_RC_QI: 0.5 days = 43200 sec.
- stdev_QI_CA: 1 day = 86400 sec.
- stdev_CA_PT: 2 days = 172800 sec.
- stdev_PT_PK: 1 day = 86400 sec.
- stdev_PK_WS: 0.5 days = 43200 sec.
- stdev_WS_DT: 1 day = 86400 sec.
- stdev_DT_AS: 5 days = 432000 sec.

Now compute cumulative variance:

- var_SS_OP = (86400)^2 = 7.46496e9
- var_OP_RC = (17280)^2 = 298598400
- var_RC_QI = (43200)^2 = 1.86624e9
- var_QI_CA = (86400)^2 = 7.46496e9
- var_CA_PT = (172800)^2 = 2.985984e10
- var_PT_PK = (86400)^2 = 7.46496e9
- var_PK_WS = (43200)^2 = 1.86624e9
- var_WS_DT = (86400)^2 = 7.46496e9
- var_DT_AS = (432000)^2 = 1.86624e11

Now cum var between any two steps: sum of relevant var_i.

Compute cum_var at each cumulative point: Let's compute variance up to each activity (starting at SS = 0). Then var for pair = var_cum[j] - var_cum[i] maybe plus covariance? Actually variance of sum of independent variables = sum of variances, so cumulative variance at index k is sum_{i=1..k} var_i. Then variance for pair (i,j) = sum of var for steps from i+1 to j? Wait if we define each base duration between successive activities as a random variable D_i (duration from activity i to i+1). The time between activity i and activity j (i < j) is sum_{k=i}^{j-1} D_k. So the variance is sum of variances of D_i..D_{j-1}. That is cum_var[j-1] - cum_var[i-1] (if cum_var[0] = 0). So we can compute cum_var at each index.

Indices: 0: SS, 1: OP, 2: RC, 3: QI, 4: CA, 5: PT, 6: PK, 7: WS, 8: DT, 9: AS.

Define D_0 = SS->OP: var0 = (86400)^2.
D_1 = OP->RC: var1 = (17280)^2.
D_2 = RC->QI: var2 = (43200)^2.
D_3 = QI->CA: var3 = (86400)^2.
D_4 = CA->PT: var4 = (172800)^2.
D_5 = PT->PK: var5 = (86400)^2.
D_6 = PK->WS: var6 = (43200)^2.
D_7 = WS->DT: var7 = (86400)^2.
D_8 = DT->AS: var8 = (432000)^2.

Now cum_var after each D_k:

- cum_var[0] = var0 = 7.46496e9
- cum_var[1] = var0+var1 = 7.46496e9 + 2.985984e8 = 7.7635584e9
- cum_var[2] = +var2 = 7.7635584e9 + 1.86624e9 = 9.6297984e9
- cum_var[3] = +var3 = 9.6297984e9 + 7.46496e9 = 1.70947584e10
- cum_var[4] = +var4 = 1.70947584e10 + 2.985984e10 = 4.69545984e10
- cum_var[5] = +var5 = 4.69545984e10 + 7.46496e9 = 5.44195584e10
- cum_var[6] = +var6 = 5.44195584e10 + 1.86624e9 = 5.62857984e10
- cum_var[7] = +var7 = 5.62857984e10 + 7.46496e9 = 6.37507584e10
- cum_var[8] = +var8 = 6.37507584e10 + 1.86624e11 = 2.503747584e11

Now pair variance for i<j: sum of var from D_i to D_{j-1} = cum_var[j-1] - cum_var[i-1] (if i>0). For i=0, use cum_var[j-1] - 0 = cum_var[j-1].

Thus compute stdev = sqrt(var). Let's compute approximate stdev values:

- SS->OP (i=0, j=1): var = cum_var[0] = 7.46496e9, sqrt = 86400 (as expected). Good.

- SS->RC (i=0,j=2): var = cum_var[1] = 7.7635584e9, sqrt = sqrt(7.7635584e9) approx = 88087. Let's compute precisely: sqrt(7.7635584e9) = sqrt(7.7635584)*sqrt(1e9) = 2.785*31623 = 87999 approx. But we can approximate 88000 sec (approx 1.02 days). Actually 86400^2 = 7.46496e9. Adding var1 (2.985984e8) yields 7.7635584e9, sqrt is about 88063 sec (0.999 days). Let's approximate as 88000 sec.

- SS->QI (i=0,j=3): var = cum_var[2] = 9.6297984e9, sqrt ~ 98130 sec (1.136 days). Actually sqrt(9.6298e9) = sqrt(9.6298)*31623 = 3.103*31623 = 98130. Good.

- SS->CA (i=0,j=4): var = cum_var[3] = 1.70947584e10, sqrt = sqrt(1.70947584)*31623 = 1.307*31623 = 41350? Wait wrong: sqrt(1.709e10) = sqrt(1.709)*10^5? Actually sqrt(1e10) = 100000. So sqrt(1.709e10) = sqrt(1.709)*1e5 = 1.306*1e5 = 130600 sec approx (1.5 days). Let's compute: 130600 sec ~ 1.51 days.

- SS->PT (i=0,j=5): var = cum_var[4] = 4.69545984e10, sqrt = sqrt(4.69545984)*1e5 = 2.167*1e5 = 216700 sec ~ 2.51 days.

- SS->PK (i=0,j=6): var = cum_var[5] = 5.44195584e10, sqrt ~ sqrt(5.44195584)*1e5 = 2.332*1e5 = 233200 sec ~ 2.70 days.

- SS->WS (i=0,j=7): var = cum_var[6] = 5.62857984e10, sqrt ~ 237300 sec ~ 2.75 days.

- SS->DT (i=0,j=8): var = cum_var[7] = 6.37507584e10, sqrt ~ 252500 sec ~ 2.92 days.

- SS->AS (i=0,j=9): var = cum_var[8] = 2.503747584e11, sqrt ~ 501,374 sec ~ 5.80 days.

But we need standard deviations for each pair, but we can approximate each using these derived numbers.

Now we must compute average times for each pair: they are cumulative sums.

Define cumulative average times: cum_time[0] = 259200 (SS->OP). Actually we defined cum_time[0] = 259200 (the time between SS and OP). Let's compute all cum_time:

Define time for each D_i: average durations:

- D0 (SS->OP) = 259200 sec (3 days)
- D1 (OP->RC) = 43200 sec (0.5 days)
- D2 (RC->QI) = 86400 sec (1 day)
- D3 (QI->CA) = 172800 sec (2 days)
- D4 (CA->PT) = 432000 sec (5 days)
- D5 (PT->PK) = 259200 sec (3 days)
- D6 (PK->WS) = 86400 sec (1 day)
- D7 (WS->DT) = 172800 sec (2 days)
- D8 (DT->AS) = 2592000 sec (30 days). Actually 30 days is 30*86400=2,592,000 sec.

Now cum_time at each index:

- cum_time[0] = D0 = 259200
- cum_time[1] = D0 + D1 = 259200+43200 = 302400
- cum_time[2] = + D2 = 302400+86400 = 388800
- cum_time[3] = + D3 = 388800+172800 = 561600
- cum_time[4] = + D4 = 561600+432000 = 993600
- cum_time[5] = + D5 = 993600+259200 = 1,252,800
- cum_time[6] = + D6 = 1,252,800+86,400 = 1,339,200
- cum_time[7] = + D7 = 1,339,200+172,800 = 1,512,000
- cum_time[8] = + D8 = 1,512,000+2,592,000 = 4,104,000

Now pair average time between activity i and j (i < j) = cum_time[j-1] - cum_time[i-1] (if i>0) else cum_time[j-1].

Let's compute each pair average:

Indices:

i=0 (SS)
i=1 (OP)
i=2 (RC)
i=3 (QI)
i=4 (CA)
i=5 (PT)
i=6 (PK)
i=7 (WS)
i=8 (DT)
i=9 (AS)

But we have 10 activities; cum_time has length 9 (for D0 to D8). The time from activity index i (0-based) to activity index j (i<j) is cum_time[j-1] - (cum_time[i-1] if i>0 else 0). Let's compute all:

- SS->OP: i=0, j=1: avg = cum_time[0] = 259200.
- SS->RC: i=0, j=2: avg = cum_time[1] = 302400.
- SS->QI: i=0, j=3: avg = cum_time[2] = 388800.
- SS->CA: i=0, j=4: avg = cum_time[3] = 561600.
- SS->PT: i=0, j=5: avg = cum_time[4] = 993600.
- SS->PK: i=0, j=6: avg = cum_time[5] = 1,252,800.
- SS->WS: i=0, j=7: avg = cum_time[6] = 1,339,200.
- SS->DT: i=0, j=8: avg = cum_time[7] = 1,512,000.
- SS->AS: i=0, j=9: avg = cum_time[8] = 4,104,000.

- OP->RC: i=1, j=2: avg = cum_time[1] - cum_time[0] = 302400-259200 = 43200.
- OP->QI: i=1, j=3: avg = cum_time[2] - cum_time[0] = 388800-259200 = 129600.
- OP->CA: i=1, j=4: avg = cum_time[3] - cum_time[0] = 561600-259200 = 302400.

Thus average times.

Now compute standard deviations (stdev) for each pair: sqrt(variance). We need to compute variance for each pair using cum_var differences. Let's compute var and stdev for each pair.

Define cum_var as earlier: cum_var[0] = var0 = 7.46496e9
cum_var[1] = var0+var1 = 7.7635584e9
cum_var[2] = 9.6297984e9
cum_var[3] = 1.70947584e10
cum_var[4] = 4.69545984e10
cum_var[5] = 5.44195584e10
cum_var[6] = 5.62857984e10
cum_var[7] = 6.37507584e10
cum_var[8] = 2.503747584e11

Now for each pair:

- SS->OP (i=0,j=1): var = cum_var[0] = 7.46496e9, stdev = 86400.

- SS->RC (i=0,j=2): var = cum_var[1] = 7.7635584e9, stdev = sqrt(7.7635584e9)  88065 sec.

- SS->QI (i=0,j=3): var = cum_var[2] = 9.6297984e9, stdev  98130 sec.

- SS->CA (i=0,j=4): var = cum_var[3] = 1.70947584e10, stdev  130,590 sec.

- SS->PT (i=0,j=5): var = cum_var[4] = 4.69545984e10, stdev  216,722 sec.

- SS->PK (i=0,j=6): var = cum_var[5] = 5.44195584e10, stdev  233,200 sec.

- SS->WS (i=0,j=7): var = cum_var[6] = 5.62857984e10, stdev  237,300 sec.

- SS->DT (i=0,j=8): var = cum_var[7] = 6.37507584e10, stdev  252,500 sec.

- SS->AS (i=0,j=9): var = cum_var[8] = 2.503747584e11, stdev  501,374 sec.

Now for other pairs.

- OP->RC (i=1,j=2): var = cum_var[1] - cum_var[0] = var1 = 2.985984e8, stdev = 17280 sec.

- OP->QI (i=1,j=3): var = cum_var[2] - cum_var[0] = var1 + var2 = 2.985984e8 + 1.86624e9 = 2.1648384e9, stdev  sqrt(2.1648384e9)  46500 sec? Let's compute: sqrt(2.1648384e9) = sqrt(2.1648384)*31623  1.470 * 31623 = 46470 sec approx. So 46470 sec ~ 0.538 days.

- OP->CA (i=1,j=4): var = cum_var[3] - cum_var[0] = var1+var2+var3 = 2.985984e8 + 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 = 9.6297984e9? Actually var1+var2+var3 = 2.985984e8 + 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 = 9.6297984e9, which matches cum_var[2]? Wait var1+var2+var3 = var0? Let's recalc: var0=7.46496e9; var1=2.985984e8; var2=1.86624e9; var3=7.46496e9. Summing var1+var2+var3 = 2.985984e8 + 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 = 9.6297984e9. So that is cum_var[2]? Wait cum_var[2] = var0+var1+var2 = 7.46496e9 + 2.985984e8 + 1.86624e9 = 9.6297984e9 (yes!). Actually cum_var[2] includes var0+var1+var2 = var0+var1+var2 = 9.6297984e9. That matches var1+var2+var3? No, var1+var2+var3 = 2.985984e8+1.86624e9+7.46496e9 = 9.6297984e9. So it's same as cum_var[2], but this is a coincidence? Let's verify: cum_var[0] = var0. cum_var[1] = var0+var1. cum_var[2] = var0+var1+var2. cum_var[3] = var0+var1+var2+var3. So var1+var2+var3 = cum_var[3] - var0 = cum_var[3] - var0 = (var0+var1+var2+var3) - var0 = var1+var2+var3. So indeed var1+var2+var3 = cum_var[3] - var0 = cum_var[3] - var0 = (var0+var1+var2+var3) - var0 = var1+var2+var3. So var1+var2+var3 = 9.6297984e9.

Thus OP->CA variance = var1+var2+var3 = 9.6297984e9, stdev  sqrt(9.6297984e9)  98130 sec (as previously computed for SS->QI). That makes sense: OP->CA includes durations OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA.

- OP->PT (i=1,j=5): var = sum var1+var2+var3+var4 = var1+var2+var3+var4 = (9.6297984e9) + var4 (2.985984e10) = 3.94896384e10. Let's compute: var4 = 2.985984e10, sum = 9.6297984e9 + 2.985984e10 = 3.94896384e10. sqrt  sqrt(3.94896384e10) = sqrt(3.94896384)*1e5 = 1.9872*1e5 = 198,720 sec approx (2.30 days). Actually compute: sqrt(3.94896e10)  198,720. So stdev  198,720 sec (~2.30 days).

- OP->PK (i=1,j=6): var = sum var1..var5 = var1+var2+var3+var4+var5 = 3.94896384e10 + var5 (7.46496e9) = 4.69545984e10. sqrt  sqrt(4.69545984e10) = 216,722 sec (approx 2.51 days). This matches earlier.

- OP->WS (i=1,j=7): var = sum var1..var6 = var1+var2+var3+var4+var5+var6 = 4.69545984e10 + var6 (1.86624e9) = 5.44195584e10. sqrt = 233,200 sec (~2.70 days). This matches earlier for SS->PK (but there var0 also included). Actually OP->WS = var1+var2+var3+var4+var5+var6 = same as cum_var[5] - var0 = 5.44195584e10 - 7.46496e9? Wait cum_var[5] = var0+var1+var2+var3+var4+var5 = 5.44195584e10. Subtract var0 (7.46496e9) yields 4.69545984e10? Wait we need to compute precisely: Let's compute sum var1..var6:

- var1 = 2.985984e8
- var2 = 1.86624e9
- var3 = 7.46496e9 2.985
- var4 =984e10
- var5 = 7.46496e9
- var6 = 1.86624e9

Sum = 2.985984e8 + 1.86624e9 = 2.1648384e9
Add var3: 2.1648384e9 + 7.46496e9 = 9.6297984e9
Add var4: 9.6297984e9 + 2.985984e10 = 3.94896384e10
Add var5: +7.46496e9 = 4.69545984e10
Add var6: +1.86624e9 = 5.44195584e10

Thus var = 5.44195584e10, sqrt = 233,200 sec (2.70 days). Good.

- OP->DT (i=1,j=8): var = sum var1..var7 = var1..var6 + var7 = 5.44195584e10 + var7 (7.46496e9) = 6.37507584e10. sqrt  252,500 sec (~2.92 days).

- OP->AS (i=1,j=9): var = sum var1..var8 = 6.37507584e10 + var8 (1.86624e11) = 2.503747584e11. sqrt  501,374 sec (~5.80 days).

Now for other pairs.

- RC->QI (i=2,j=3): var = var2 = 1.86624e9, stdev = 43200 sec.

- RC->CA (i=2,j=4): var = var2+var3 = 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 = 9.3312e9, sqrt  96600 sec? Let's compute sqrt(9.3312e9) = sqrt(9.3312)*31623 = 3.055*31623 = 96600 sec approx (1.12 days). Actually compute: sqrt(9.3312e9) = 96,600. Good.

- RC->PT (i=2,j=5): var = var2+var3+var4 = 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 + 2.985984e10 = 3.948? Actually sum = 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 = 9.3312e9, + 2.985984e10 = 3.918... Wait 9.3312e9 + 2.985984e10 = 3.918... Let's compute precisely: 2.985984e10 + 9.3312e9 = 3.918... Let's compute: 2.985984e10 + 9.3312e9 = 2.985984e10 + 0.93312e10 = 3.919104e10. Wait check: 2.985984e10 + 9.3312e9 = 2.985984e10 + 0.93312e10 = 3.919104e10. So var = 3.919104e10, sqrt  sqrt(3.919104e10) = sqrt(3.919104)*1e5  1.9797*1e5 = 197,970 sec (~2.29 days). So approx 198k sec.

- RC->PK (i=2,j=6): var = var2+var3+var4+var5 = 3.919104e10 + var5 (7.46496e9) = 4.6656e10? Let's add: 3.919104e10 + 7.46496e9 = 4.6656e10 (since 3.919104e10 + 0.746496e10 = 4.6656e10). sqrt  sqrt(4.6656e10)  216,000 sec? Actually sqrt(4.6656e10) = sqrt(4.6656)*1e5 = 2.160*1e5 = 216,000 sec (2.5 days). Good.

- RC->WS (i=2,j=7): var = var2+var3+var4+var5+var6 = 4.6656e10 + var6 (1.86624e9) = 4.852224e10. sqrt  sqrt(4.852224e10) = sqrt(4.852224)*1e5 = 2.202*1e5 = 220,200 sec (~2.55 days). Actually compute: sqrt(4.852224e10)  220,200 sec.

- RC->DT (i=2,j=8): var = var2+var3+var4+var5+var6+var7 = 4.852224e10 + var7 (7.46496e9) = 5.59872e10. sqrt  sqrt(5.59872e10)  236,600 sec (~2.74 days). Wait earlier we computed for SS->PK maybe similar. Let's compute: sqrt(5.59872e10) = sqrt(5.59872)*1e5 = 2.367*1e5 = 236,700 sec.

- RC->AS (i=2,j=9): var = sum var2..var8 = 5.59872e10 + var8 (1.86624e11) = 2.426112e11. sqrt  sqrt(2.426112e11) = sqrt(2.426112)*1e5 = 1.557*1e5 = 155,700 sec? Actually sqrt(2.426112e11) ~ 492,000 sec? Wait need to compute: sqrt(2.426112e11) = sqrt(2.426112)*sqrt(1e11) = 1.557 * 1e5.5? Actually sqrt(1e11) = 316227.766. So multiply: 1.557 * 316227.766 = 492,000 approx. Yes about 492,000 sec (~5.70 days). Let's compute precisely: 2.426112e11 = 242,611,200,000. sqrt = about 492,000 (since 492k^2 = 242,064,000,000). Slightly more: maybe 492,300. So ~492,300 sec (~5.70 days). That matches earlier SS->AS stdev ~501k.

Now for other pairs:

- QI->CA (i=3,j=4): var = var3 = 7.46496e9, stdev = 86400 sec.

- QI->PT (i=3,j=5): var = var3 + var4 = 7.46496e9 + 2.985984e10 = 3.73248e10. sqrt = sqrt(3.73248e10)  193,200 sec? Let's compute: sqrt(3.73248e10) = sqrt(3.73248)*1e5 = 1.931*1e5 = 193,100 sec. So approx 193,100 sec (~2.23 days).

- QI->PK (i=3,j=6): var = var3+var4+var5 = 3.73248e10 + 7.46496e9 = 4.478976e10. sqrt  sqrt(4.478976e10)  211,600 sec (~2.45 days).

- QI->DT (i=3,j=8): var = var3+var4+var5+var6+var7 = 4.6656e10 + 7.46496e9 = 5.412096e10. sqrt  232,500 sec (~2.69 days).

- CA->PT (i=4,j=5): var = var4 = 2.985984e10, stdev = 172800 sec (2 days). Wait earlier we used stdev of var4: var4 = (172800)^2 = 2.985984e10. sqrt = 172800 sec (2 days). Yes.

- CA->PK (i=4,j=6): var = var4+var5 = 2.985984e10 + 7.46496e9 = 3.73248e10, sqrt  193,100 sec (2.23 days).

- PT->PK (i=5,j=6): var = var5 = 7.46496e9, stdev = 86400 sec (1 day). Indeed var5 = (86400)^2.

- PT->WS (i=5,j=7): var = var5+var6 = 7.46496e9 + 1.86624e9 = 9.3312e9, sqrt  96600 sec (1.12 days).

Let's compute correctly: 1.679616e10 = 16,796,160,000. sqrt ~ 129,590 (since 129,590^2  16,791,? Actually 129,600^2 = 16,796,160,000 exactly. So yes stdev  129,600 sec (1.5 days). Good.

- PT->AS (i=5,j=9): var = var5+var6+var7+var8 = 1.679616e10 + 1.86624e11 = 2.0442016e11, sqrt  452,000 sec? Let's compute: sqrt(2.0442e11) = sqrt(2.0442)*316227.766  1.430*316227.766 = 452,000 sec (5.23 days). Good.

- PK->WS (i=6,j=7): var = var6 = 1.86624e9, stdev = 43200 sec (0.5 days).

- PK->DT (i=6,j=8): var = var6+var7 = 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 = 9.3312e9, sqrt  96,600 sec (1.12 days).

- PK->AS (i=6,j=9): var = var6+var7+var8 = 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 + 1.86624e11 = 1.  Actually sum = 1.86624e9 + 7.46496e9 = 9.3312e9; + 1.86624e11 = 1.959552e11? Wait: 1.86624e11 + 9.3312e9 = 1.959552e11. sqrt  sqrt(1.959552e11)  442,700 sec (5.12 days). Compute: sqrt(1.959552e11) = sqrt(1.959552)*316227.766  1.3998 * 316227.766 = 442,600 sec.

- WS->DT (i=7,j=8): var = var7 = 7.46496e9, stdev = 86400 sec (1 day).

- WS->AS (i=7,j=9): var = var7+var8 = 7.46496e9 + 1.86624e11 = 1.9408896e11, sqrt  440,500 sec? Let's compute: sqrt(1.9408896e11) = sqrt(1.9408896)*316227.766  1.393 * 316227.766 = 440,500 sec (5.1 days). Good.

- DT->AS (i=8,j=9): var = var8 = 1.86624e11, stdev = sqrt(1.86624e11) = 432,000 sec? Let's compute: sqrt(1.86624e11) = sqrt(1.86624)*316227.766 = 1.3665*316227.766 = 432,000 sec exactly? Actually var8 = (432000)^2 = 1.86624e11. So sqrt = 432,000 sec (5 days). Yes, because we set var8 as (5 days) squared.

Thus we have variance and standard deviation.

Now we must compile dictionary.

Thus we need to produce a dictionary with keys like ('SS','OP'), ('SS','RC'), etc, mapping to tuples (average_time, standard_deviation). The average_time we computed earlier as cum_time differences. The standard_deviation we computed as above approximated values.

Now we need to ensure values are integers (seconds). Use appropriate rounding: stdev values approximated as integer seconds, rounding to nearest integer.

Thus dictionary will be something like:

{
    ('SS','OP'): (259200, 86400),
    ('SS','RC'): (302400, 88065),

    ('WS','AS'): (2764800, 440500),
    ('DT','AS'): (2592000, 432000)
}

But need to verify consistency: for OP->PT we used avg = 734400, stdev approx 198720, but we computed earlier 198,720 (approx). For RC->PT we used 691200 avg (makes sense), stdev ~198k. For PT->AS we used avg 3,110,400 (makes sense), stdev approx 452,000. Good.

Also need to verify some numbers:

- OP->PK average 993600 (should be sum of durations OP->RC (43200) + RC->QI (86400) + QI->CA (172800) + CA->PT (432000) + PT->PK (259200) = let's compute: 43200+86400=129600; +172800=302400; +432000=734400; +259200=993600. Yes correct.

- OP->WS average: add PK->WS (86400) = 1,080,000. Good.

- OP->DT average: add WS->DT (172800) = 1,252,800.

- OP->AS average: add DT->AS (2,592,000) yields 3,844,800.

Check: OP->AS = 3844800, matches.

- RC->PK average: sum RC->QI (86400) + QI->CA (172800) + CA->PT (432000) + PT->PK (259200) = 86400+172800=259200; +432000=691200; +259200=950400. Yes.

- RC->WS average: add PK->WS (86400) = 1,036,800.

- RC->DT average: add WS->DT (172800) = 1,209,600.

- RC->AS average: add DT->AS (2,592,000) = 3,801,600.

- QI->PK average: sum QI->CA (172800) + CA->PT (432000) + PT->PK (259200) = 172800+432000=604800; +259200=864000. Yes.

- QI->WS: add PK->WS (86400) = 950,400.

- QI->DT: add WS->DT (172800) = 1,123,200.

- QI->AS: add DT->AS = 2,592,000 => 3,715,200.

- CA->PT: direct: 432000.

- CA->PK: add PT->PK = 259200 => 691200.

- CA->WS: add PK->WS (86400) + PT->PK (259200) = 345600? Wait that's not correct: CA->WS = CA->PT + PT->PK + PK->WS = 432000+259200+86400 = 777600. Yes.

- CA->DT: CA->WS + WS->DT = 777600+172800 = 950400.

- CA->AS: CA->DT + DT->AS = 950400+2,592,000 = 3,542,400.

- PT->PK = 259200.

- PT->WS = PT->PK + PK->WS = 259200+86400 = 345600.

- PT->DT = PT->WS + WS->DT = 345600+172800=518400.

- PT->AS = PT->DT + DT->AS = 518400+2,592,000 = 3,110,400.

- PK->WS = 86400.

- PK->DT = PK->WS + WS->DT = 86400+172800 = 259200.

- PK->AS = PK->DT + DT->AS = 259200+2,592,000 = 2,851,200.

- WS->DT = 172800.

- WS->AS = WS->DT + DT->AS = 172800+2,592,000 = 2,764,800.

- DT->AS = 2,592,000.

All matches earlier.

Now we need to ensure dictionary includes these pairs. They want a "representative subset", but we can provide all pairs. The prompt: "Please construct a dictionary that includes a representative subset of these activity pairs, ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps." So they want a subset, not necessarily all 45. But we can provide all 45 for completeness. But perhaps better to include many pairs including far ones.

We need to ensure that each tuple is (average_time, standard_deviation). They gave an example with integer values. Our values are large seconds but integer. They may prefer numbers in seconds, but can also provide in days? Probably seconds. So fine.

We need to output a dictionary in Python. Perhaps name variable "temporal_profile". We'll provide code.

Potential improvements: Use proper formatting; optionally annotate approximate.

But maybe we should give the dictionary with keys sorted.

We should also be mindful that dictionary values should be integer or float; we can use ints.

Thus final answer: Provide dictionary of pairs with average times and standard deviations.

But the user might want a more succinct dictionary with maybe some pairs. But they'd likely want a fairly comprehensive set. The prompt explicitly says "representative subset", so we can provide some. But I'd provide all for completeness.

Potential concerns: The dictionary might be large; but it's okay.

Now produce answer with explanation and dictionary.

But be careful: The user wrote: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." Wait that phrase suggests they don't want us to provide numbers in the prompt itself (the description), but they want us to produce numbers in the answer. They say "the LLM should estimate these times", meaning we should estimate them. So okay.

Thus output dictionary.

Now write final answer: include short description of approach, then dictionary. Ensure dictionary is syntactically correct.

Will provide as:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS','OP'): (259200, 86400),
    ('SS','RC'): (302400, 88065),
    ...
}
```

Make sure we have all pairs.

Now generate final answer. We'll incorporate rounding. For simplicity, use integer approximations: stdev values approximated to nearest integer second.

List:

Let's generate all pairs systematically:

Indices:

0: SS
1: OP
2: RC
3: QI
4: CA
5: PT
6: PK
7: WS
8: DT
9: AS

Compute average times and stdev for each pair i<j.

I'll generate list:

i=0 (SS) with j>0:

('SS','OP'): avg=259200, std=86400

('WS','AS'): avg=2764800, std=440500

i=8 (DT) with j>8:

('DT','AS'): avg=2592000, std=432000

We must ensure standard deviations approximate as per earlier calculations. Let's double-check each:

- SS->RC: we approximated std 88065. Use 88066 maybe. Could round to nearest integer: 88066. But we can use 88065.

- SS->QI: std ~98130. Use 98130.

- SS->CA: std ~130590. Use 130590.

- SS->PT: std ~216722. Use 216722.

- SS->PK: std ~233200. Use 233200.

- SS->WS: std ~237300. Use 237300.

- SS->DT: std ~252500. Use 252500.

- SS->AS: std ~501374. Use 501374.

- OP->QI: std ~46470. Use 46470.

- OP->CA: std ~98130.

- OP->PT: std ~198720.

- OP->PK: std ~216722.

- OP->WS: std ~233200.

- OP->DT: std ~252500.

- OP->AS: std ~501374.

- RC->CA: std ~96600.

- RC->PT: std ~197,970 (approx 198000). Use 198000.

- RC->PK: std ~216000.

- RC->WS: std ~220200.

- RC->DT: std ~236700.

- RC->AS: std ~492300.

- QI->PT: std ~193100.

- QI->PK: std ~211600.

- QI->WS: std ~216000.

- QI->DT: std ~232500.

- QI->AS: std ~490700.

- CA->PK: std ~193100.

- CA->WS: std ~197970.

- CA->DT: std ~216000.

- CA->AS: std ~482800.

- PT->WS: std ~96600.

- PT->DT: std ~129600.

- PT->AS: std ~452000.

- PK->DT: std ~96600.

- PK->AS: std ~442600.

- WS->AS: std ~440500.

All are approximations.

Now format dictionary. Let's construct dictionary:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # SS as source
    ('SS','OP'): (259200, 86400),
    ('SS','RC'): (302400, 88065),
    ('SS','QI'): (388800, 98130),
    ('SS','CA'): (561600, 130590),
    ('SS','PT'): (993600, 216722),
    ('SS','PK'): (1252800, 233200),
    ('SS','WS'): (1339200, 237300),
    ('SS','DT'): (1512000, 252500),
    ('SS','AS'): (4104000, 501374),

    # OP as source
    ('OP','RC'): (43200, 17280),
    ('OP','QI'): (129600, 46470),
    ('OP','CA'): (302400, 98130),
    ('OP','PT'): (734400, 198720),
    ('OP','PK'): (993600, 216722),
    ('OP','WS'): (1080000, 233200),
    ('OP','DT'): (1252800, 252500),
    ('OP','AS'): (3844800, 501374),

    # RC as source

    ('RC','PT'): (691200, 198000),
    ('RC','PK'): (950400, 216000),
    ('RC','WS'): (1036800, 220200),
    ('RC','DT'): (1209600, 236700),
    ('RC','AS'): (3801600, 492300),

    # QI as source
    ('QI','CA'): (172800, 86400),
    ('QI','PT'): (604800, 193100),
    ('QI','PK'): (864000, 211600),
    ('QI','WS'): (950400, 216000),
    ('QI','DT'): (1123200, 232500),
    ('QI','AS'): (3715200, 490700),

    # CA as source
    ('CA','PT'): (432000, 172800),
    ('CA','PK'): (691200, 193100),
    ('CA','WS'): (777600, 197970),
    ('CA','DT'): (950400, 216000),
    ('CA','AS'): (3542400, 482800),

    # PT as source
    ('PT','PK'): (259200, 86400),
    ('PT','WS'): (345600, 96600),
    ('PT','DT'): (518400, 129600),
    ('PT','AS'): (3110400, 452000),

    # PK as source
    ('PK','WS'): (86400, 43200),
    ('PK','DT'): (259200, 96600),
    ('PK','AS'): (2851200, 442600),

    # WS as source
    ('WS','DT'): (172800, 86400),
    ('WS','AS'): (2764800, 440500),

    # DT as source
    ('DT','AS'): (2592000, 432000),
}
```

That should satisfy.

We could include a brief note: All times are in seconds; average_time is mean time difference between the two activities; standard_deviation reflects typical variability.

We need to ensure that dictionary keys are tuples and values are tuples.

Now produce final answer with explanation and dictionary. Possibly also note that times are approximations based on typical durations in supply chain. That should be okay.

</think>
Below is a **temporalprofile** dictionary that approximates the average time (in seconds) between every pair of activities that can appear one after another in the described hightech electronics supplychain process, together with an estimated standarddeviation (also in seconds).  

The numbers are **orderofmagnitude estimates** derived from typical leadtimes, manufacturing cycles, testing windows, packaging, warehousing and distribution delays.  They are intended to illustrate the kind of temporal information that a processmining tool would store in a *temporal profile*.

```python
# Temporal profile for the global hightech electronics supplychain
# All values are expressed in seconds (1 day = 86400s)

temporal_profile = {
    # ----- Activities that start with “SS” (Supplier Selection) -----

**Explanation of the numbers**

* **Average time** – the mean elapsed time (in seconds) from the completion of the first activity to the completion of the second activity in a single process execution.  
* **Standard deviation** – the typical variation around that mean, derived from the variability of each individual step (supplier leadtime, manufacturing, testing, packaging, warehousing, shipping, aftersales service, etc.).

These values are **approximations** meant to illustrate a realistic temporal profile for a global hightech electronics supply chain.  In a realworld setting, the exact averages and standard deviations would be extracted from eventlog data using processmining techniques.
