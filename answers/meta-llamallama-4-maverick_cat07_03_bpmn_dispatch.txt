The image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of shipping goods from a warehouse to customers. The chart is divided into three sections: "Warehouse," "Dispatch of goods/Computer Hardware Shop/Secretary," and "Logistics." Each section contains various steps and decision-making points, represented by rectangles and diamonds, respectively.

**Warehouse Section:**

*   The process begins with the "Package goods" step.
*   If the packaging takes longer than 48 hours, the "Notify customer about delay" step is triggered.
*   Once the packaging is complete, the process proceeds to the "Dispatch of goods/Computer Hardware Shop/Secretary" section.

**Dispatch of goods/Computer Hardware Shop/Secretary Section:**

*   The "Clarify shipment method" step involves checking if special handling is required.
*   If special handling is necessary, the "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" step is initiated.
*   The "Check if insurance is required" step follows, which may lead to the "Insure parcel" step if insurance is necessary.
*   The "Write package label" step is always executed.
*   The "Select logistic company and place order" step is performed after obtaining offers from logistic companies.
*   The process then proceeds to the "Logistics" section.

**Logistics Section:**

*   The "Fill out Shipment paperwork" step is executed in parallel with the "Move package to pickup area" step.
*   Once both steps are completed, the "Shipment prepared" step is reached, indicating the end of the process.

In summary, the flowchart outlines the steps involved in shipping goods from a warehouse to customers, including packaging, clarifying shipment methods, checking insurance requirements, and preparing shipments for logistics. The chart provides a clear visual representation of the process, highlighting the various decision-making points and parallel tasks involved.
