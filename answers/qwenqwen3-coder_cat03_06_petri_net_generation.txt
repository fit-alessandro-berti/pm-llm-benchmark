Here's the **Python code** to construct an **accepting Petri net** for the described **insurance claim management process**, using `pm4py`. The Petri net includes:

- Places representing states between activities.
- Transitions representing the process steps.
- Arcs to define the control flow.
- Loops to model re-submission (`DV  RDS`) and repeated investigations (`FC  II`).
- An initial marking (`im`) with a token in the start place.
- A final marking (`fm`) with a token in the final "Closed" place.

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create a new Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="insurance_claim_process")

# --- Places ---
start_place = PetriNet.Place("start")
registered = PetriNet.Place("registered")
docs_verified = PetriNet.Place("docs_verified")
fraud_checked = PetriNet.Place("fraud_checked")
assessed = PetriNet.Place("assessed")
approved = PetriNet.Place("approved")
paid = PetriNet.Place("paid")
notified = PetriNet.Place("notified")
closed = PetriNet.Place("closed")

# Add places to the net
for place in [start_place, registered, docs_verified, fraud_checked,
              assessed, approved, paid, notified, closed]:
    net.places.add(place)

# --- Transitions ---
claim_registration = PetriNet.Transition("claim_registration", "Claim Registration (CR)")
document_verification = PetriNet.Transition("document_verification", "Document Verification (DV)")
re_doc_submission = PetriNet.Transition("re_doc_submission", "Re-Document Submission (RDS)")
fraud_check = PetriNet.Transition("fraud_check", "Fraud Check (FC)")
in_depth_investigation = PetriNet.Transition("in_depth_investigation", "In-depth Investigation (II)")
claim_assessment = PetriNet.Transition("claim_assessment", "Claim Assessment (CA)")
approval = PetriNet.Transition("approval", "Approval (AP)")
payment = PetriNet.Transition("payment", "Payment (P)")
notification = PetriNet.Transition("notification", "Notification (N)")
closure = PetriNet.Transition("closure", "Closure (CL)")

# Add transitions to the net
for transition in [claim_registration, document_verification, re_doc_submission,
                   fraud_check, in_depth_investigation, claim_assessment,
                   approval, payment, notification, closure]:
    net.transitions.add(transition)

# --- Arcs ---
# From start to Claim Registration
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_place, claim_registration, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_registration, registered, net)

# Document Verification and possible loop with Re-Document Submission
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(registered, document_verification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verification, docs_verified, net)

# Loop for re-submission
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(docs_verified, re_doc_submission, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(re_doc_submission, registered, net)

# From Docs Verified to Fraud Check
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(docs_verified, fraud_check, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, fraud_checked, net)

# Loop for In-depth Investigation
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_checked, in_depth_investigation, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(in_depth_investigation, docs_verified, net)

# From Fraud Checked to Claim Assessment
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_checked, claim_assessment, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_assessment, assessed, net)

# Approval (optional based on amount, but modeled as required step)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(assessed, approval, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval, approved, net)

# Payment
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approved, payment, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment, paid, net)

# Notification
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(paid, notification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification, notified, net)

# Closure
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notified, closure, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(closure, closed, net)

# --- Initial and Final Markings ---
im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[closed] = 1

# Optional: Print summary
print("Petri net constructed with:")
print(f"Places: {[p.name for p in net.places]}")
print(f"Transitions: {[t.label for t in net.transitions]}")
print("Initial marking:", im)
print("Final marking:", fm)
```

###  Summary of the Net:

- **Start Place:** `start`
- **Final Place:** `closed`
- **Loops:**
  - Between `docs_verified`  `re_doc_submission`  `registered` (for re-submission)
  - Between `fraud_checked`  `in_depth_investigation`  `docs_verified` (for repeated investigations)
- **Sequence:**
  ```
  start  CR  DV  RDS  FC  II  CA  AP  P  N  CL  closed
  ```

This Petri net captures the required behavior including concurrency, choice, and iteration, and can be used with `pm4py` for simulation, analysis, or conformance checking.
