Below is an analysis of the event log and the identification of key factors contributing to longer resolution times:

  
1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

• Case 101 and Case 103 have relatively quick turnaround times (a little over 2 hours and about 1.5 hours, respectively).  
• In contrast:  
 Case 102 spans from 8:05 on March 1 to 9:15 on March 2 (over 25 hours).  
 Case 104 spans from 8:20 on March 1 to 8:30 on March 2 (approximately 24 hours).  
 Case 105 spans from 8:25 on March 1 to 9:30 on March 3 (nearly 49 hours).  

Thus, Cases 102, 104, and especially 105 are outliers with much longer cycle times.

  
2. Potential Root Causes & Contributing Factors

A. Escalations to a Specialized Team  
• Both Case 102 and Case 105 involve an escalation to a Level-2 agent.  
• The escalation in these cases appears to introduce a waiting period before any further investigation is resumed.  
• For example, in Case 105, after the initial investigation on March 1, an escalation occurs at 10:00 and the next investigation step is not until nearly 28 hours later (on March 2).  
• This suggests that tickets requiring specialized intervention may be bottlenecked by the availability or response capacity of Level-2 agents.

B. Long Waiting Times Before Investigation or Resolution  
• In Case 104, there is a substantial delay between the assignment (09:30) and the start of the investigation (13:00) on the same day.  
• For Case 102, the time gap between assigning to a Level-1 agent and the escalation as well as between escalation and the next investigation is considerably long.  
• Such delays may indicate issues like resource constraints (e.g., overload of support staff or specialized teams) or inefficient hand-offs within the process.

C. Process Bottlenecks and Workflow Inefficiencies  
• Delays at the “Investigation Issue” stage hint at potential process issues – either in prioritization or in the workflow that governs when and how tickets are escalated.  
• Once escalated, if there is no clear protocol or sufficient staff to take over promptly, resolution times are naturally extended.

  
3. Insights and Recommendations

• Review and Optimize Escalation Protocols  
– Assess if the criteria for escalation are too broad or if the Level-2 team is being engaged prematurely.  
– Consider streamlining the handoff process between Level-1 and Level-2 agents to reduce waiting times.

• Set and Monitor Key Time Targets for Each Stage  
– Implement service-level targets for the “Investigation Issue” and “Resolve Ticket” stages.  
– Use the event log to monitor shifts in cycle times which may point to additional bottlenecks during peak workload periods.

• Enhance Staffing or Scheduling for Specialized Teams  
– Evaluate whether the specialized (Level-2) team has adequate staffing during the hours when escalations peak.  
– If necessary, adjust schedules or invest in additional resources to ensure that escalated tickets receive prompt attention.

• Introduce Process Automation Where Feasible  
– Automate notifications and reminders upon escalation to prevent delays in re-assigning or beginning investigations.  
– Consider using automated triage tools to classify tickets more effectively, possibly reducing the need for manual escalation unless absolutely necessary.

  
Conclusion

The analysis of the event log reveals that tickets involving escalations (Cases 102 and 105) and those with significant delays between assignment and investigation (Case 104) are the main contributors to longer resolution times. These delays likely stem from process bottlenecks – particularly in the escalation hand-off and waiting times before specialized investigation. Addressing these issues through improved protocols, resource optimization, and potential automation could lead to a more efficient ticket resolution process and reduce overall cycle times.
