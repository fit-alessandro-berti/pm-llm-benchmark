Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performances, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. **Screening and Extensive Screening:**
   - Protected Group: Extensive Screening is performed more frequently (793 times) and has a higher average performance (540,011.977) compared to the unprotected group (1022 times, 480,013.530). This suggests that the protected group undergoes more thorough checks before being accepted as tenants.
   - Unprotected Group: The unprotected group has more instances (2490 times) of simply rejecting prospective tenants after screening, with a lower average performance (400,004.640). This could indicate that the unprotected group faces more rejections after initial screening.

2. **Rejection After Viewing:**
   - Protected Group: There are fewer instances (484 times) of rejecting prospective tenants after viewing the property, with a lower average performance (89,999.306). This suggests that the protected group has a higher chance of being considered for tenancy after viewing the property.
   - Unprotected Group: The unprotected group has more instances (674 times) of rejection after viewing, with a higher average performance (240,000.654). This indicates that the unprotected group faces more rejections after viewing the property.

3. **Tenant Cancellation:**
   - Protected Group: The protected group has a wider range of process variants for tenant cancellation, including instances with extensive screening (29 times, 810,021.897) and multiple rent payments (up to 11 times, 1,349,975.636). This suggests that the protected group has more opportunities to establish themselves as tenants before cancellation.
   - Unprotected Group: The unprotected group has more instances (268 to 56 times) of tenant cancellation, with a narrower range of process variants. The average performance for these variants is lower, indicating that the unprotected group has fewer opportunities to establish themselves as tenants before cancellation.

4. **Eviction:**
   - Protected Group: There is only one instance (6 times) of eviction in the protected group, with a performance of 990,084.833. This suggests that the protected group faces fewer instances of eviction.
   - Unprotected Group: There are no instances of eviction in the provided process variants for the unprotected group.

These differences suggest that the protected group is subject to more thorough checks and has more opportunities to establish themselves as tenants, while the unprotected group faces more rejections and cancellations.
