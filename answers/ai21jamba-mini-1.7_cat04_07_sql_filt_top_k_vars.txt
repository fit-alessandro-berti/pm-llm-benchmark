Here is the DuckDB SQL query to address the specified requirements:

```sql
-- Step 1: Extract the sequence of activities for each case and order by timestamp
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_index
    FROM event_log
),

-- Step 2: Group events by case_id and extract the complete ordered sequence per case
complete_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        JSON_ARRAYAGG(activity ORDER BY activity_index) AS activity_sequence
    FROM ordered_events
    GROUP BY case_id
),

-- Step 3: Count occurrences of each activity sequence to determine unique variants
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM complete_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),

-- Step 4: Rank variants by frequency to identify the top K variants
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        case_count,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
),

-- Step 5: Filter events to include only those belonging to the top K variants
filtered_events AS (
    SELECT e.*
    FROM event_log e
    JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM ranked_variants
        WHERE rank <= $K -- Replace $K with the desired number of top variants
    ) selected_cases
    ON e.case_id = selected_cases.case_id
)

-- Step 6: Retrieve the final results
SELECT *
FROM filtered_events;
```

### Explanation of Steps:

1. **Ordered Events**: Orders activities within each case by their timestamps. A `ROW_NUMBER()` function ensures order.
2. **Complete Sequences**: Aggregates activities per case into a single JSON array, preserving order.
3. **Variant Counts**: Counts occurrences of each unique activity sequence.
4. **Variant Ranking**: Ranks activity sequences by frequency in descending order.
5. **Filtered Events**: Joins the original event log with the top-ranked variants to filter relevant cases.
6. **Final Results**: Retrieves all events from the filtered cases.

You can replace `$K` with the specific number of top variants you wish to identify.
