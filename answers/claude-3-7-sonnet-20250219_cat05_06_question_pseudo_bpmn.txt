# 20 Thought-Provoking Questions About the Smartphone Supply Chain Process

1. How does the company balance the trade-off between conducting thorough market research and getting to market quickly in an industry where consumer preferences change rapidly?

2. What criteria determine whether a failed quality check results in rework versus scrapping the device entirely, and how might this decision point be optimized?

4. What factors influence the decision between air freight and cargo shipping, and how might this gateway be transformed into a more nuanced decision model that considers carbon footprint, cost, and time-to-market?

5. How does the process account for feedback loops from post-sales customer experiences back to the R&D and design phases?

6. In what ways could the parallel procurement of components be sequenced or prioritized differently to reduce working capital requirements while maintaining production schedules?

7. What contingency processes exist if a critical component supplier experiences a catastrophic disruption (natural disaster, political instability, etc.)?

8. How might emerging technologies like blockchain or IoT sensors transform the monitoring and transparency of this supply chain process?

9. What ethical considerations should be integrated into the process regarding labor practices at the Malaysian assembly plant operating 24/7?
