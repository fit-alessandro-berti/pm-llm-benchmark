Based on the provided BPMN 2.0 XML, there are no task elements defined in the model. The sequence flow elements define connections between elements, but they do not represent tasks.

To identify the tasks in the process model, we would need to examine the `bpmn:task` elements, which are not present in this specific example.

However, if you can provide me with more information about the process model or additional XML code, I'd be happy to help you identify the tasks.
