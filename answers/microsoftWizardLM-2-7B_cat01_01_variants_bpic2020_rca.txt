To identify the root causes for performance issues in the process based on the variants provided, we need to analyze the frequency and performance data of each process variant. Let's consider some process and data specific factors that could be influencing the performance:

1. **Approval Bottlenecks**:
   - Variants with a high frequency of rejections (e.g., Administrator, Pre-Approver, Budget Owner, Supervisor) followed by additional rejections before final approval might indicate a bottleneck in the approval process. This can lead to delays as each rejection requires the submitter to go back and address the concerns before resubmission.
   - The variant with the longest average duration (e.g., 1,88 days with a performance of 2,061,236.516 for the process sequence with two rejections and three approvals) suggests a significant delay that could be a root cause for performance issues.

2. **Number of Steps and Decision Points**:
   - Processes with more steps and decision points (e.g., the variant with a frequency of 188 and 9 steps) typically take longer to complete and increase the chances of human error or delays.
   - Simplifying the process or streamlining approval steps could reduce the time to completion.

3. **Rejections and Resubmissions**:
   - A high number of rejections (e.g., the variant with a frequency of 54 and an average performance of 1,604,595.638 involves three rejections before the final approval) indicates a need for clearer guidelines or better communication to reduce the number of back-and-forth cycles.
   - Resubmissions after rejections can be a significant drain on performance, especially if the feedback provided is vague or if the required information is not easily accessible.

4. **Manual Handling and Errors**:
   - The presence of 'Manually Handled' steps in the process (implicit in the use of 'Request Payment') can introduce variability and errors. Automating these steps where possible could reduce processing time and improve accuracy.

5. **Performance of Individual Steps**:
   - The performance metric seems to capture the processing time from 'Request Payment' to 'Payment Handled'. Variants with lower performance scores might indicate issues with the payment processing system or manual handling times.

6. **Application-Specific Issues**:
   - If the process is automated through a software system, performance issues could be due to bugs, inefficient algorithms, or scalability issues within the system.

7. **Resource Availability**:
   - The performance might be affected by the availability of the individuals in the process (e.g., Administrators, Budget Owners, Supervisors). If these roles have a high workload or low staffing levels, the process will be delayed.

8. **Data Quality and Accessibility**:
   - Incomplete, inaccurate, or hard-to-find data can cause delays in the decision-making process. Ensuring data quality and ease of access can significantly improve process performance.

9. **Regulatory or Compliance Checks**:
   - If certain steps in the process involve regulatory or compliance checks, these might inherently slow down the process. However, this would not explain variance across different process paths.

10. **Process Path Differences**:
    - The variability in performance across different process paths suggests that certain sequence of steps or decision points may lead to more efficient processing than others. Analyzing these differences could reveal optimization opportunities.

To address these performance issues, a root cause analysis should be conducted, potentially using process mining tools to visualize the process flow and identify any anomalies or bottlenecks. After identifying the issues, process redesign, automation, and training can be implemented to improve the efficiency and performance of the process. Non-value-adding steps should be eliminated, and the process should be streamlined to reduce the time from submission to payment handling. Additionally, clear guidelines and communication channels should be established to reduce the number of rejections and resubmissions.
