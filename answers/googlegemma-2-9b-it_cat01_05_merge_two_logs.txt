## Merged Event Log

This merged event log combines Log A and Log B, aligning events based on order_id and timestamp. Slight timestamp differences are addressed by prioritizing the timestamps from Log A as the "primary" timeline. 

**Format:** `timestamp, event_name, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes, attribute_from_log_A`

```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,OrderReceived,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Event captured at warehouse system", event_type: Order Received 
2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,OrderValidation,Order#1234,u12,r10,"Cross-check inventory", event_type: Order Validated
2023-10-10T10:02:05Z,PaymentCheck,Order#1234,u12,r99,"Payment gateway delay", event_type: Payment Processed
2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,u45,r11,"Random inspection" 
2023-10-10T10:05:02Z,Shipping,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Package handed to courier", event_type: Item Shipped
2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Timestamp Handling:** Log A's timestamps are considered primary due to the context that they reflect the time the order system *received* the event.  
* **Event Name Variations:** Events like "OrderReceived" in Log B were aligned with "Order Received" in Log A, considering them the same occurrence. 
* **Attribute Merging:**  Attributes from both logs were combined for merged events.  For example, the "Quality Check" event from Log B was added to the merged log without a direct equivalent in Log A because it provided additional context.


<b>Missing Events:** 

*  Log A did not include a "PaymentCheck" event comparable to Log B's "PaymentCheck".  This suggests a level of detail Log B captured that Log A didn't.



**Note:**

This is a practical example of merging event logs based on the provided limitations. If we had access to richer metadata or standardized schemas for the logs, the merging process could be more automated and precise.
