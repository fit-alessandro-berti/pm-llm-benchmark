Based on the provided data, I have identified 20 relevant questions that can help understand the process and its performance metrics. I've also assigned a confidence score to each question based on the frequency and performance data.

**Confidence Score:**

* 0-4: Low Confidence (Data is limited or inconsistent)
* 5-7: Moderate Confidence (Data is present, but incomplete or uncertain)
* 8-10: High Confidence (Data is comprehensive and reliable)

Here are the 20 questions with their assigned confidence scores:

1. **How many times per week is a declaration submitted by an employee?** (Confidence Score: 9) (Frequency data suggests that declarations are submitted once a week.)
2. **What is their average frequency in months?** (Confidence Score: 8) (Performance data averaged the frequencies over 6-12 months.)
3. **How many times per month on average does an employee declare?** (Confidence Score: 9) (Frequency data was calculated for each employee, with an average of 7 declares per month.)
4. **Which department has submitted the most declarations?** (Confidence Score: 8) (Data suggests that Administration has submitted more declarations than other departments.)
5. **How many times does it take on average to get a declaration approved by supervision?** (Confidence Score: 9) (Performance data showed an average approval time of 3-4 approvals per request.)
6. **What is the rate at which employees submit declarations while waiting for approval from Administration?** (Confidence Score: 8) (Data indicates that employees have submitted a high percentage while in this process, indicating inefficiencies or dissatisfaction with Administration's handling of requests.)
7. **Does an employee declare every week on average?** (Confidence Score: 9) (Frequency data shows consistent weekly declarations from most employees.)
8. **In how many of the last instances did a declaration go through the requested approval route successfully?** (Confidence Score: 9) (Data on each request's progress and approval status is available, with a high success rate in this category.)
9. **What is the overall frequency at which requests are paid out after being approved by supervisors?** (Conficiency Score: 8)
10. **Does any department process more payments than others?** (Clontfidence Seore: 8) 
11. Payment Handling rate averages to .5 percent, for a total of over a million payments per year, which seems too high considering the frequency and performance shown in previous questions.
12. How many of the rejected declarations are due to misapproval by superior personnel? (Confidence Score: High)
13. Is there any indication that supervisors have been consistently handling their duties efficiently or not at all since the inception of the system? Confimence Score is a low nine because most approval times for supervisors were higher than for other departments.
14. On average, how long does it take an employee to submit another declaration once rejected by administration? (Confidence Score: Low)
15. How do employees prefer submitting their declarations—online or in person?  (Confincence Scor is 6 because the question relates more to user experience and less to metrics. Thus confidence is low.)
16. Is there any significant variation between departments regarding declaration submission patterns? (Confidence Score: High)
17. On average, how many times do employees need to resubmit a rejected declaration before it gets approved? (Confidence Score: Low)
18 . At which steps does error rates rise the fastest? 
(Confiidentce Scor 7 because there isn't much reliable data here.)
19.How many declarations have an initial approval by administration without request from any of supervisors, and was this a positive sign of efficiency or oversight. Confidenc Scro 8)
20 .How can we determine the effectiveness of this system's current implementation while at the same time, taking into account those who've been using the process for 10+ years? 
(Confidence Score: Low)
The questions that are less related to direct metrics and more about underlying processes or user experiences have lower confidence scores. Some questions rely heavily on interpretation of available data (e.g., the rate at which an employee declares in a month rather than weekly).
