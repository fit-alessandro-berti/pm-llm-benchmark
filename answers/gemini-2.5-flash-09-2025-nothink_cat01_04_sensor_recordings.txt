## Process Mining Analysis: Inferring Activities from Sensor Data

The goal is to infer manufacturing activities by clustering events based on characteristic patterns in the sensor readings (temperature, pressure, vibration, flow, tool position, and energy consumption).

### Inferred Activities and Rationale

We identify five distinct phases (activities) in the event log:

| Activity Label | Events Included | Key Sensor Patterns | Rationale |
| :------------- | :-------------- | :------------------ | :-------- |
| **Activity 1: Idle/Standby** | 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15 | Low, stable values across all metrics. Ambient temperature, minimal energy use, no material flow, no tool movement. | This represents the machine waiting for a job or transitioning between tasks. Minimal resource consumption indicates inactivity. |
| **Activity 2: Material Feeding & Positioning** | 4, 5, 6 | Significant increases in energy, temperature, and vibration. **Crucially, Material Flow is high (5 units/s) and Tool Position is rapidly increasing (0 $\to$ 10 mm).** | The machine is actively taking in raw material or components (high flow) and positioning the main tool or component into the working area, requiring moderate power and causing initial friction/heat buildup. |
| **Activity 3: Cutting/Machining** | 7, 8 | Sustained, moderate energy usage and stable pressure (2 bar). Lower flow (2 units/s) compared to Activity 2, suggesting ongoing processing rather than initial intake. Tool Position is held constant (15 mm). | The stable, elevated pressure, energy, and tool position suggest a sustained operation like drilling, milling, or precise machining. The moderate temperature and vibration indicate continuous material removal or manipulation. |
| **Activity 4: Welding/High-Intensity Joining** | 9 | **Sudden, dramatic spike in Energy (5.00 kWh) and Temperature (80°C), accompanied by very high Vibration (50 Hz). Material Flow is 0.** Tool Position is held constant. | This short, intense burst of energy and heat, with no material flowing in or out, strongly suggests a concentrated, high-power operation like welding or laser bonding, which generates significant localized heat and vibration. |
| **Activity 5: Quality Inspection/Rework** | 10, 11, 12 | Temperature rapidly drops (80°C $\to$ 25°C). Energy drops significantly (but remains above standby). Tool Position moves slightly (15 $\to$ 20 mm). Low, sporadic Vibration. Minimal Material Flow (0 $\to$ 1 unit/s). | After a high-intensity step (Welding), the machine cools down. The slight, controlled movement of the tool/sensor (15 to 20 mm) and minimal residual energy usage suggest an optical or tactile inspection, minor adjustment, or cooling period before the product is moved out. |

| 7-8     | Mid  | Stable High | Stable Mid | Stable Low | Constant High | Stable High | **Cutting/Machining** |
| 9       | **Very High** | Stable High | **Very High** | **None** | Constant High | **Peak** | **Welding/High-Intensity Joining** |
| 10      | Dropping | Dropping | Low       | None | Constant High | Low    | **Quality Inspection/Rework** (Start Cooling) |
| 11-12   | Low  | Low      | Low       | Very Low | Slightly Moving | Low/Mid | **Quality Inspection/Rework** (Inspection Phase) |
| 13-15   | Low  | Low      | None      | None | 0             | Low    | **Idle/Standby** |

### Summary of the Inferred Process Flow

Based on this analysis, the inferred process sequence for the product is:

$$\text{Idle/Standby} \rightarrow \text{Material Feeding \& Positioning} \rightarrow \text{Cutting/Machining} \rightarrow \text{Welding/High-Intensity Joining} \rightarrow \text{Quality Inspection/Rework} \rightarrow \text{Idle/Standby}$$

This demonstrates how process mining techniques, even applied manually to raw numerical data, can successfully extract a meaningful sequence of manufacturing activities.
