To construct a temporal profile for this global supply chain process, we need to consider pairs of activities where one eventually follows the other, directly or through intermediate steps. Below is a Python dictionary representing a temporal profile for a representative subset of these activity pairs. The estimated average times and standard deviations are based on typical scenarios in complex supply chains, but note that these are hypothetical and should be adjusted based on actual data and specific process characteristics.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 43200),       # Average 2 days, std dev 12 hours
    ('OP', 'RC'): (259200, 86400),       # Average 3 days, std dev 1 day
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),        # Average 1 day, std dev 6 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 43200),       # Average 2 days, std dev 12 hours
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 21600),        # Average 1 day, std dev 6 hours
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 14400),        # Average 12 hours, std dev 4 hours
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 7200),         # Average 6 hours, std dev 2 hours
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),        # Average 1 day, std dev 12 hours
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200),      # Average 1 week, std dev 3 days
    ('SS', 'RC'): (518400, 172800),      # Average 6 days, std dev 2 days
    ('OP', 'QI'): (345600, 129600),      # Average 4 days, std dev 1.5 days
    ('RC', 'CA'): (432000, 144000),      # Average 5 days, std dev 2 days
    ('QI', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),       # Average 3 days, std dev 1 day
    ('CA', 'PK'): (172800, 43200),       # Average 2 days, std dev 12 hours
    ('PT', 'WS'): (86400, 21600),        # Average 1 day, std dev 6 hours
    ('PK', 'DT'): (43200, 14400),        # Average 12 hours, std dev 4 hours
    ('WS', 'AS'): (1209600, 604800),     # Average 2 weeks, std dev 1 week
}

```

### Explanation of Estimated Times:

- **Supplier Selection to Order Placement (`SS` to `OP`)**: Typically takes 2 days as suppliers need to be evaluated, quotes obtained, and decisions made.
- **Order Placement to Receive Components (`OP` to `RC`)**: Often around 3 days due to shipping and handling times.
- **Receive Components to Quality Inspection (`RC` to `QI`)**: 1 day to organize and start the inspection process.
- **Quality Inspection to Component Assembly (`QI` to `CA`)**: 2 days for sorting out quality issues and preparing components.
- **Component Assembly to Product Testing (`CA` to `PT`)**: 1 day for assembly to be completed and tested.
- **Product Testing to Packaging (`PT` to `PK`)**: 12 hours to package products after successful testing.
- **Packaging to Warehouse Storage (`PK` to `WS`)**: 6 hours to store packaged products efficiently.
- **Warehouse Storage to Distribution (`WS` to `DT`)**: 1 day to manage logistics and prepare for distribution.
- **Distribution to After-Sales Support (`DT` to `AS`)**: 1 week to account for customer feedback and support setup.
- **Direct Long-Term Steps**: Include longer time frames for steps that are not consecutive, such as `SS` to `RC` and `OP` to `QI`.

These values are illustrative and should be calibrated with real process data for accuracy.
