Certainly! Below is a simple example of a DECLARE model for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. This process might include activities such as creating a purchase order, receiving the goods, receiving an invoice, and making a payment. Here's how the DECLARE model might look:
```python
{
  'existence': {'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                'Receive Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                'Make Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
  'init': {'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
  'succession': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                 ('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                 ('Receive Invoice', 'Make Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
  'response': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Audit Provided'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
               ('Receive Goods', 'Goods Audit Provided'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
               ('Receive Invoice', 'Invoice Check Provided'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
  'chainprecedence': {('Make Payment', 'Create Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
  'noncoexistence': {('Goods Audit Provided', 'Invoice Check Provided'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
  'nonsuccession': {('Make Payment', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                    ('Make Payment', 'Create Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                    ('Make Payment', 'Receive Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}
}
```

This model assumes that the Purchase-to-Pay process starts by creating a purchase order, followed by receiving the goods, receiving the invoice
