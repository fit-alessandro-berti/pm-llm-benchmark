Based on the provided data, the main anomalies in the process variants are:

1. Inconsistent frequencies: The frequencies of the process variants are not consistent, which may indicate that some process variants are more common or important than others.

2. Inconsistent performance: The performance values of the process variants are not consistent, which may indicate that some process variants are more efficient or effective than others.

3. Missing or duplicate steps: Some process variants have missing or duplicate steps, which may indicate errors or inefficiencies in the process.

4. Unbalanced process flows: Some process variants have unbalanced process flows, with more steps in one direction than the other. This may indicate that the process is not well-designed or optimized.

5. Inconsistent use of resources: The process variants may be using different resources or performing different tasks, which may indicate that the process is not standardized or consistent.

6. Inconsistent use of penalties: Some process variants include penalties, while others do not. This may indicate that the process is not consistent in its use of penalties or that penalties are not always necessary or appropriate.

7. Inconsistent use of appeals: Some process variants include appeals, while others do not. This may indicate that the process is not consistent in its use of appeals or that appeals are not always necessary or appropriate.

8. Inconsistent use of credit collection: Some process variants include credit collection, while others do not. This may indicate that the process is not consistent in its use of credit collection or that credit collection is not always necessary or appropriate.

9. Inconsistent use of judges: Some process variants include judges, while others do not. This may indicate that the process is not consistent in its use of judges or that judges are not always necessary or appropriate.

10. Inconsistent use of prefectures: Some process variants include prefectures, while others do not. This may indicate that the process is not consistent in its use of prefectures or that prefectures are not always necessary or appropriate.
