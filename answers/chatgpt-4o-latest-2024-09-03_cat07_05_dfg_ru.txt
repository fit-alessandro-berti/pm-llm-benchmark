The provided visualization appears to depict a flowchart of a process, likely related to handling requests or claims. It contains different steps, connections, and labeled numbers that represent the number of occurrences or transitions between tasks. Below is a step-by-step description:

### Elements:
1. **Start (circle with a black dot at the top left):**
   - This represents the initiation of the process with an incoming flow labeled `6`, indicating that there are 6 incoming requests (or instances) to start the process.

2. **Register Request (purple rectangle):**
   - First step labeled "register request" with the number "6" inside it, signifying that six requests are registered here. There's one incoming flow of 6 and one outgoing flow labeled `2`.

3. **Check Ticket (purple rectangle):**
   - Next step in the process after registering the request is "check ticket," with 9 occurrences (or tickets being checked). It receives 6 requests and sends 2 to the next step (indicated by the outgoing arrows).
   
4. **Decide (purple rectangle):**
   - In this decision step labeled "decide", 9 tickets are being decided upon. There are multiple outgoing transitions signifying different outcomes from this decision:
      - Arrows labeled `6` and `1` go back to "check ticket."
      - Several arrows move forward towards outcomes such as rejecting requests, paying compensation, reinitiating requests, or conducting an examination.

5. **Examine Thoroughly (white rectangle):**
   - One of the decision outcomes leads to "examine thoroughly" with 3 occurrences. This task is reached by following an arc from "decide" with a flow rate of 1.

6. **Examine Casually (white rectangle):**
   - Another examination option is "examine casually" with 6 occurrences. This task is reached by flowing from "decide" with a flow combination of 1 and 2.

7. **Reject Request, Pay Compensation, Reinitiate Request (white rectangles):**
   - These outcomes are reached by flowing from the "decide" step:
      - **Reject Request**: 3 occurrences, rejection step.
      - **Pay Compensation**: 3 occurrences, compensation step.
      - **Reinitiate Request**: 3 occurrences, reactivation of the request and likely flowing back into earlier stages of the process.

8. **End (circle with black square at the top right):**
   - The process concludes with this step after certain tasks like rejecting, compensation, or reinitiating requests, with arrows flowing into this terminal node.

### Arrows and Flows:
- The arrows represent the transitions between steps, including loops where tasks might send requests back to a prior step (e.g., "check ticket"). The numbers on the arrows indicate the number of requests or occurrences that follow that particular path.

### General Process Flow:
1. An incoming request is registered and proceeds to the ticket-checking stage.
2. Tickets are either returned for rechecking, proceed to decision-making, or follow other steps depending on the examination outcome.
3. Based on the decision, a request may be rejected, compensated, reinitiated, or examined further (casually or thoroughly).
4. The process ends with either closure or further actions in response to the completed decision.

This flowchart seems to be a representation of a decision-making workflow with multiple steps and feedback loops, indicating a path through examining, deciding, and handling outcomes such as compensation or rejection.
