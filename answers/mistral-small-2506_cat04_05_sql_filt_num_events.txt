# DuckDB SQL Query to Filter Cases with 6 or Fewer Events

Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)

SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.case_id,
    e.timestamp;
```

## Explanation:

1. The CTE (Common Table Expression) `case_counts` first calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by:
   - Grouping by `case_id`
   - Counting the rows in each group
   - Filtering to only include cases with 6 or fewer events (using `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`)

2. The main query then:
   - Joins the original `event_log` table with the filtered `case_counts` CTE
   - Returns all columns from the original table (aliased as `e`)
   - Orders the results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for better readability

This approach efficiently filters out cases with more than 6 events while preserving all event details for the remaining cases.
