Let's analyze both POWL models in relation to a standard **Hire-to-Retire (H2R)** process and identify anomalies. The normative sequence for H2R typically follows this order:

1. Post Job Ad
2. Screen Candidates
3. Conduct Interviews (usually after initial screening)
4. Make Hiring Decision
5. Onboard Employee
6. Add to Payroll
7. Close Case

Now, let's analyze each model for deviations.

---

### **Analysis of Model 1:**
**Structure:**
This is a **strict partial order (PO)** model with linear dependencies between activities. There are no loops or choices (XOR).

**Dependencies:**
1. Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates
2. Screen_Candidates  Decide (Make_Hiring_Decision)
3. Screen_Candidates  Interview
4. Decide  Onboard
5. Onboard  Payroll
6. Payroll  Close

**Anomalies in Model 1:**
1. **Parallel Interviewing and Decision Making**
   - Normally, interviews should happen **before** making a hiring decision (since interviews help in decision-making).
   - Here, `Screen  Interview` and `Screen  Decide` are both dependencies, meaning interviews and decision-making can happen in parallel (no strict order between them). This is illogical—you shouldn’t decide before interviewing!

2. **No Loop for Onboarding (Minor Issue)**
   - In reality, onboarding might involve multiple steps (e.g., paperwork, training), but this model treats it as a single activity.
   - However, since this is a simplified model, this may not be a severe anomaly.

**Severity:**
- The parallelism between `Interview` and `Decide` is a **major anomaly** because it violates the logical sequence of hiring processes.

### **Analysis of Model 2:**
**Structure:**
This model introduces **loops and choices (XOR)**, making it more flexible but potentially more prone to anomalies.

**Dependencies:**
1. Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates
2. Post_Job_Ad  Interview (Directly, bypassing screening)
3. Interview  Decide
4. Decide  Loop(Onboard, skip)
5. Loop  XOR(Payroll, skip)
6. XOR  Close

**Anomalies in Model 2:**
1. **Interviews Before Screening**
   - Normally, candidates are screened (based on resumes) before interviews.
   - Here, `Post  Interview` allows interviews to happen **before** screening, which is unusual (though not impossible if pre-screening is done informally).

2. **Loop in Onboarding**
   - A loop (`*(Onboard, skip)`) suggests onboarding can be repeated or skipped entirely.
   - While some onboarding steps might require rework, allowing skipping (`skip`) is unusual—onboarding is typically mandatory.

3. **XOR Choice for Payroll**
   - The XOR (`Payroll` or `skip`) implies an employee might not be added to payroll, which is a **critical anomaly**—employees must be paid!
   - This could represent a process where payroll is optional (e.g., contractors), but in a standard H2R process, payroll is mandatory.

4. **No Explicit Screening Before Interviews**
   - Unlike Model 1, there’s no strict dependency forcing screening before interviews (since `Post  Interview` exists). This could lead to inefficiencies (interviewing unqualified candidates).

**Severity:**
- The **XOR on Payroll** is a **critical anomaly** because payroll is essential for employees.
- The **loop on Onboarding** is questionable—while some flexibility is acceptable, allowing it to be skipped entirely is problematic.
- The **lack of strict screening before interviews** is a process inefficiency but not a severe anomaly.

### **Comparison & Decision:**
**Model 1 Issues:**
- Main problem: Parallel execution of `Interview` and `Decide` (illogical ordering).

**Model 2 Issues:**
- More severe issues:
  1. Payroll can be skipped (critical).
  2. Onboarding can be skipped (problematic).
  3. Interviews can happen before screening (process inefficiency).

**Which Model is Closer to Normative H2R?**
- **Model 1** is closer to a standard H2R process because:
  - It enforces a mostly correct sequence (except the parallelism issue).
  - It does not allow critical steps like payroll or onboarding to be skipped.
  - Model 2’s anomalies are more severe (skipping payroll is unacceptable in typical HR processes).

**Justification:**
- While Model 1 has a logical flaw (parallel interviews and decisions), it doesn’t allow critical steps to be skipped.
- Model 2’s flexibility introduces risks (e.g., employees not being paid) that are unacceptable in a real-world H2R process.

**Final Answer:**
**Model 1** is more aligned with a normative Hire-to-Retire process because, despite its ordering anomaly, it does not allow critical activities (like payroll) to be skipped. Model 2 introduces more severe anomalies (skipping payroll, optional onboarding) that violate core HR compliance requirements.

However, if the anomalies in Model 1 were fixed (e.g., forcing `Interview` before `Decide`), it would be the clear winner. As is, Model 1 is still preferable over Model 2 due to its less severe deviations from normative workflows.

**Recommendation:**
Fix Model 1 by ensuring `Interview` precedes `Decide`, making it a fully compliant model. Model 2 would require removing the XOR on payroll and restructuring the loop logic to be acceptable.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Model 1’s flaw:** Logical ordering issue (interviews and decisions parallel).
- **Model 2’s flaws:** Critical steps (payroll, onboarding) can be skipped; interviews may bypass screening.
- **Model 1 is better** because its anomalies are less severe than those in Model 2.

If forced to choose between the two as-is, **Model 1 is the better fit** for a normative Hire-to-Retire process. However, both models could be improved.
