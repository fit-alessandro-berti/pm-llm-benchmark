### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Observation:** The average time is approximately 25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation of 1 hour.  
   - **Anomaly:** This suggests a rigid, possibly artificial or automated schedule for approval that does not align with typical variability in claim processing.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Observation:** The average delay is 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days.  
   - **Anomaly:** This inconsistency indicates potential backlogs, resource constraints, or ad-hoc delays in notifying customers after approval.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Observation:** The average time is only 2 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour.  
   - **Anomaly:** Claims are being closed too quickly after assignment, potentially bypassing critical steps like evaluation or approval.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Observation:** The average time is just 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1 minute.  
   - **Anomaly:** This rapid transition suggests skipping intermediate steps or an overly streamlined process that may not comply with business rules.

### Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Exist

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Automated systems might be approving claims without sufficient human oversight, leading to artificially consistent timing. Alternatively, approvals could be batch-processed at fixed intervals, creating a rigid schedule.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Delays in notification could stem from manual processes requiring additional documentation or approvals before notifying customers. Backlogs in communication channels or understaffed teams might also contribute.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Some claims might be prematurely closed due to errors in categorization (e.g., marking them as resolved without proper evaluation). Alternatively, certain types of claims (e.g., low-value or rejected claims) might follow an expedited closure process.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Notifications might be triggered automatically after evaluation without human intervention, leading to unrealistically short intervals. Alternatively, notifications could be sent prematurely due to system misconfigurations.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

#### 1. Identify Specific Claims with Timing Deviations
To find claims where the time between activities falls outside expected ranges:

```sql
-- R to P: Find claims where time between Receive and Approve deviates significantly
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) NOT BETWEEN 86400 - 3600 AND 86400 + 3600; -- Outside 24 ± 1 hour range

-- P to N: Find claims where time between Approve and Notify exceeds 7 days
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 86400 AS time_diff_days
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800; -- More than 7 days
```

#### 2. Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters, Claim Types, or Resources
To investigate whether specific adjusters, claim types, or resources are associated with anomalies:

```sql
-- A to C: Find claims closed within 2 hours of assignment and group by adjuster
SELECT 
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters a 
    ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) <= 7200 -- Within 2 hours
GROUP BY 
    a.name
ORDER BY 
    anomaly_count DESC;

-- E to N: Find claims with evaluation-to-notification times under 5 minutes and group by claim type
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN 
    claims c 
    ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) <= 300 -- Within 5 minutes
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_type
ORDER BY 
    anomaly_count DESC;
```

#### 3. Investigate Expedited or Delayed Processes
To identify claims closed immediately after assignment or delayed excessively between approval and notification:

```sql
-- Claims closed immediately after assignment
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) <= 7200; -- Within 2 hours

-- Claims with excessive delay between approval and notification
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 86400 AS time_diff_days
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800; -- More than 7 days
```

### Summary of Findings
The anomalies suggest irregularities in the claim handling process, potentially caused by automation, manual bottlenecks, or procedural shortcuts. The proposed SQL queries can help pinpoint specific claims, adjusters, or claim types associated with these anomalies, enabling targeted investigation and process improvement.
