### **Process Mining Analysis of Manufacturing Assembly Line Events**

By analyzing the sensor readings (temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption), we can infer distinct **phases** in the manufacturing process. Below is the grouping of events into meaningful activities, along with the rationale for each label.

---

### **1. Idle / Standby (Events 1-3, 13-15)**
**Sensor Patterns:**
- **Temperature:** ~20°C (ambient)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (atmospheric)
- **Vibration:** 0 Hz (no movement)
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s (no material movement)
- **Tool Position:** 0 mm (tool retracted)
- **Energy:** ~0.4-0.5 kWh (minimal power draw)

**Rationale:**
- The machine is in a **non-operative state**, likely waiting for the next task or in standby mode.
- No significant changes in any sensor readings indicate **no active manufacturing process**.

---

### **2. Cutting Metal (Events 4-6)**
**Sensor Patterns:**
- **Temperature:** Rises to **50-58°C** (heat from friction)
- **Pressure:** Slight increase to **1.5 bar** (material resistance)
- **Vibration:** **30-38 Hz** (high-frequency cutting motion)
- **Material Flow:** **5 units/s** (steady feed of material)
- **Tool Position:** **5-10 mm** (tool engaged with workpiece)
- **Energy:** **2.0-3.0 kWh** (high power consumption)

**Rationale:**
- **High vibration and temperature** suggest **mechanical cutting** (e.g., milling, lathe operation).
- **Steady material flow** indicates continuous material removal.
- **Increasing tool position** suggests progressive cutting depth.

---

### **3. Assembling Parts (Events 7-8)**
**Sensor Patterns:**
- **Temperature:** **40°C** (moderate, likely from handling)
- **Pressure:** **2 bar** (clamping or fitting parts)
- **Vibration:** **10 Hz** (low, precise movements)
- **Material Flow:** **2 units/s** (controlled feed)
- **Tool Position:** **15 mm** (fixed position, likely holding parts)
- **Energy:** **2.0 kWh** (moderate power)

**Rationale:**
- **Low vibration and steady pressure** suggest **precision assembly** (e.g., fitting components).
- **Reduced material flow** indicates careful placement rather than aggressive cutting.
- **Stable tool position** implies a **holding or clamping operation**.

---

### **4. Welding (Event 9)**
**Sensor Patterns:**
- **Temperature:** **80°C** (high heat from welding)
- **Pressure:** **2 bar** (clamping parts together)
- **Vibration:** **50 Hz** (high-frequency welding motion or arc instability)
- **Material Flow:** **0 units/s** (no new material introduced)
- **Tool Position:** **15 mm** (fixed, likely holding parts in place)
- **Energy:** **5.0 kWh** (very high power draw)

**Rationale:**
- **Extreme temperature spike** is characteristic of **welding or thermal joining**.
- **High energy consumption** aligns with welding equipment (e.g., arc or laser welding).
- **No material flow** suggests fusion of existing parts rather than material removal.

---

### **5. Quality Inspection / Cooling (Events 10-12)**
**Sensor Patterns:**
- **Temperature:** Drops to **25-30°C** (cooling down)
- **Pressure:** **1 bar** (release of clamping)
- **Vibration:** **1-5 Hz** (minimal movement, possibly inspection probe)
- **Material Flow:** **0-1 units/s** (minimal or no material movement)
- **Tool Position:** **15-20 mm** (possible retraction or inspection position)
- **Energy:** **1.0-1.6 kWh** (low power, likely sensors/inspection)

**Rationale:**
- **Temperature drop** suggests **cooling after welding**.
- **Low vibration and pressure** indicate **non-destructive inspection** (e.g., visual or sensor-based checks).
- **Minimal material flow** implies **no active processing**, just verification.

---

### **6. Reset / Return to Idle (Events 13-15)**
**Sensor Patterns:**
- **Temperature:** Returns to **20°C** (ambient)
- **Pressure:** **1 bar** (atmospheric)
- **Vibration:** **0 Hz** (no movement)
- **Material Flow:** **0 units/s** (no material)
- **Tool Position:** **0 mm** (tool fully retracted)
- **Energy:** **~0.5 kWh** (standby power)

**Rationale:**
- The machine **resets to idle state**, preparing for the next cycle.
- All readings return to **baseline standby conditions**.

| **Quality Inspection**  | 10-12      | Cooling (25-30°C), minimal vibration (1-5 Hz), low energy (1-1.6 kWh)                |
| **Reset to Idle**       | 13-15      | Returns to standby conditions                                                         |

### **Summary of Activity Transitions**
1. **Idle  Cutting Metal** (Event 4): Sudden increase in temperature, vibration, and energy.
2. **Cutting  Assembling** (Event 7): Temperature drops, vibration decreases, material flow slows.
3. **Assembling  Welding** (Event 9): Sharp temperature and energy spike, vibration peaks.
4. **Welding  Inspection** (Event 10): Temperature drops, energy decreases, minimal movement.
5. **Inspection  Idle** (Event 13): All readings return to baseline.

This analysis provides a **data-driven process model** of the manufacturing line, inferring activities purely from sensor patterns. Further refinement could involve **machine learning clustering** or **domain expert validation** to improve label accuracy.
