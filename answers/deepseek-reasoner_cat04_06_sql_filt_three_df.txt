We are going to break down the problem:

 Step 1: Identify cases that have the sequence of three activities in direct succession: 
   'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'

 Step 2: For those cases, check the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

 Step 3: Exclude the events of those cases that meet both conditions.

 We will use window functions to check the sequence and then filter out the cases that meet the condition.

 Approach for Step 1:

 We can use window functions to assign a row number per case ordered by timestamp, and then check for the sequence.

 Alternatively, we can use the LEAD function to look at the next two activities for each event.

 However, note: the sequence must be in direct succession, meaning no other events in between.

 We can try:

 For each case, we can check for an event where:
   activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   and next activity = 'Create Order'
   and the activity after that = 'Confirm Order'

 We can use:

 WITH sequence_check AS (
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     activity,
     timestamp,
     LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
     LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_activity,
     LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp,
     LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_timestamp
   FROM event_log
 )

 Then, we can look for rows where:
   activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND
   next_activity = 'Create Order' AND
   next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

 But note: we are only interested in the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', which would be between next_timestamp and next_next_timestamp.

 However, we must be cautious: if the same case has multiple sequences, we need to capture each occurrence? The problem says "any case" that contains the sequence. So if a case has at least one such sequence and the time condition, we exclude the entire case.

 So we can do:

 WITH flagged_cases AS (
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     MAX(CASE 
           WHEN activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
            AND LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order'
            AND LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order'
            AND DATEDIFF('day', LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp), LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)) > 5
           THEN 1 
           ELSE 0 
         END) AS exclude_flag
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
 )

 But note: the above MAX will mark the case if at least one sequence meets the condition.

 However, the above window function in a grouped context might be tricky because the LEAD is computed before the GROUP BY. Alternatively, we can use a subquery to compute the leads and then aggregate.

 Alternatively, we can do:

 WITH sequences AS (
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     -- We are going to get the timestamp of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' for the sequence
     LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_order_ts,
     LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_ts
   FROM event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
     AND LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order'
     AND LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order'
 )

 But note: this will only return rows where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and the next two are as required. However, we cannot use LEAD in the WHERE clause because it is a window function.

 Alternatively, we can do:

 WITH sequence_found AS (
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     1 as exclude_flag
   FROM (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       activity,
       timestamp,
       LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
       LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act,
       LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts,
       LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_ts
     FROM event_log
   ) 
   WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
     AND next_act = 'Create Order'
     AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
     AND DATEDIFF('day', next_ts, next_next_ts) > 5
   GROUP BY case_id
 )

 But note: the same case might have multiple sequences, but we only need to know if at least one meets the condition.

 However, the above query might return the same case multiple times if there are multiple sequences? We group by case_id to get distinct cases.

 But wait: what if the same case has the sequence multiple times and one of them meets the time condition? Then we exclude the case.

 So we can do:

 WITH exclude_cases AS (
   SELECT DISTINCT case_id
   FROM (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       activity,
       LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
       LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act,
       LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts,
       LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_ts
     FROM event_log
   ) 
   WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
     AND next_act = 'Create Order'
     AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
     AND DATEDIFF('day', next_ts, next_next_ts) > 5
 )

 Then, we can select all events from event_log where case_id is not in exclude_cases.

 However, note: the problem says "return all events from event_log except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and the timing condition".

 So we can do:

 SELECT *
 FROM event_log
 WHERE case_id NOT IN (
   SELECT case_id FROM exclude_cases
 )

 But note: the above subquery might be expensive because we are computing leads for every row and then filtering. Alternatively, we can use EXISTS.

 Alternatively, we can use a CTE that marks the cases to exclude.

 Let's write the query:

 Step-by-step:

 1. Create a CTE that for each case, for each event, looks at the next two events (by timestamp) and checks if the current event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the next next is 'Confirm Order', and the time difference between the next and next next is more than 5 days.

 2. Then, we collect the distinct case_id that have at least one such sequence.

 3. Then, we return all events from event_log where the case_id is not in that list.

 However, note: the window function will run over the entire event log, but we are only interested in the sequence of three. Also, we must consider that the same case might have multiple sequences, but we only need to know if at least one meets the condition.

 Let's write the query:

WITH exclude_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
      LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act,
      LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts,
      LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_ts
    FROM event_log
  ) 
  WHERE 
    activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND
    next_act = 'Create Order' AND
    next_next_act = 'Confirm Order' AND
    DATEDIFF('day', next_ts, next_next_ts) > 5
)

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM exclude_cases)

 But note: the window function in the inner query is computed for every row. This might be heavy for large logs, but it's straightforward.

 Alternatively, we can use a more efficient method by only looking at the three activities and then checking the order and timestamps, but that might be more complex.

 However, note: the problem says "in direct succession", so we must ensure there are no other events between them. The above method using LEAD exactly checks that because if there is an event between, then the next_act or next_next_act would be that event and not the expected one.

 But wait: what if the case has more than three events? The LEAD(activity, 1) and LEAD(activity, 2) will get the immediate next and the one after, so if there's an event in between, then the condition won't hold.

 So this method is correct.

 Let's test with an example:

 Example case: case1 has events:
   event1: activity='Approve Purchase Requisition', timestamp=T1
   event2: activity='Create Order', timestamp=T2
   event3: activity='Confirm Order', timestamp=T3

 For event1:
   activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   next_act = 'Create Order'
   next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
   next_ts = T2
   next_next_ts = T3

 Then we check DATEDIFF('day', T2, T3) > 5 -> if true, then case1 is excluded.

 Example case: case2 has events:
   event1: activity='Approve Purchase Requisition', timestamp=T1
   event2: activity='Some Other Activity', timestamp=T2
   event3: activity='Create Order', timestamp=T3
   event4: activity='Confirm Order', timestamp=T4

 For event1:
   next_act = 'Some Other Activity' -> doesn't match, so skip.

 For event2: 
   activity is not 'Approve Purchase Requisition', so skip.

 So case2 is not excluded.

 Example case: case3 has two sequences, one that meets the time condition and one that doesn't. We only need one meeting to exclude the entire case.

 So the query should work.

 However, note: the window function in the inner query might have performance issues, but for the purpose of this problem, we assume it's acceptable.

 Let's write the final query.
</think>
To solve this problem, we need to identify cases in an event log that contain a specific sequence of activities in direct succession and meet a time condition between two of these activities. Events from such cases should be excluded from the final result. The solution involves using window functions to detect the sequence and time condition, then filtering out the relevant cases.

### Approach
1. **Identify Cases with the Sequence**: Use the `LEAD` window function to check for the sequence of activities ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order') in direct succession within each case.
2. **Check Time Condition**: For cases with the sequence, verify if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.
3. **Filter Cases**: Collect all case IDs that meet both conditions and exclude all events associated with these cases from the final result.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH exclude_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) AS sub
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND
        next_activity = 'Create Order' AND
        next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order' AND
        DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM exclude_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **CTE (exclude_cases)**:
   - The inner query uses `LEAD` to access subsequent activities and timestamps for each event within a case, ordered by timestamp.
   - The outer query filters these results to find events where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after is 'Confirm Order'. It also checks if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days using `DATEDIFF`.
   - `DISTINCT` ensures each case ID is listed only once if it meets the conditions.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Selects all events from `event_log` where the `case_id` is not in the list of excluded cases from the CTE.
   - Results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain the sequence of events.

This approach efficiently identifies and excludes cases that meet the specified sequence and time conditions using window functions and a CTE, ensuring optimal performance and clarity.
