Based on the data, I can identify several differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups. Here are some observations:

1. **Number of process variants**: The protected group has more process variants (17) compared to the unprotected group (15). This could indicate that the protected group has more diverse or complex routes through the process.
2. **Frequency and performance**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency (average: ~2200) and lower performance (average: ~540000) compared to the protected group (average: ~430, performance: ~840000). This could suggest that the process is more streamlined and efficient for the unprotected group.
3. **Frequency of extensive screening**: The protected group has a higher frequency of extensive screening (8 instances) compared to the unprotected group (2 instances). This could indicate that the protected group requires more stringent screening processes.
4. **Longer process variants**: The protected group has longer process variants, with some instances spanning 10-14 steps, whereas the unprotected group's longest process variant has 9 steps. This could suggest that the protected group requires more extensive or complex processing.
5. **Variability in performance**: The protected group has more variability in performance times, with some instances taking over 1 million seconds to complete, whereas the unprotected group's performance times are more consistent, ranging from ~400000 to ~1200000 seconds.
6. **Rejection rates**: The unprotected group has a higher rejection rate (65.6%), whereas the protected group's rejection rate is lower (37.3%). This could suggest that the protected group is more successful in completing the process.

Domain knowledge suggests that these differences may be due to various factors, such as:

* The protected group may have more stringent criteria for rental agreements or require more documentation, leading to longer processing times and more extensive screening.
* The unprotected group may have simpler or more streamlined processes, reducing the number of steps and processing time.
* The differences in rejection rates could be attributed to the protected group's more stringent criteria or the unprotected group's higher applicant pool.

These findings should be further analyzed and validated to ensure fairness and equity in the treatment of both groups.
