First, the user is asking me to draft a prompt for a benchmark. The prompt is about writing a DuckDB SQL query based on an event log table.


## Drafting benchmark prompt  
- The task involves creating a prompt for a benchmark related to writing DuckDB SQL queries.  
- The prompt focuses on using an `event_log` table with columns `case_id` and `activity`.

## Drafting benchmark prompt  
- The `event_log` table includes a `timestamp` column, with `case_id` grouping events for each process instance.  
- The SQL query must filter cases with more than six events and return events from cases with six or fewer events.  
- The task is to exclude cases with over six events, ensuring only valid cases remain for analysis.  
- The user’s instruction is to draft a prompt for a benchmark, likely expecting a clear SQL query formulation.  
- The response should focus on crafting a DuckDB SQL query based on the specified filtering criteria.

```sql
WITH valid_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM valid_cases);
```

### Explanation:
- The CTE `valid_cases` groups the `event_log` table by `case_id` and uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify only those `case_id`s that have 6 or fewer events.
- The main `SELECT` statement then filters the original `event_log` table to include only rows where the `case_id` is in the set of valid cases, effectively returning all events from cases with 6 or fewer events while excluding those with more than 6. This ensures the correct grouping (by `case_id`) and filtering (based on event count per case).
