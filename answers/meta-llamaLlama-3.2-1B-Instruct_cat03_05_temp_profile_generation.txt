**Temporal Profile Estimation**
=====================================

Below is a Python solution that will help estimate the temporal profile based on the provided explanation.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def estimateTemporalProfile(activity_pairs):
    """
    Estimate the temporal profile for a given set of activity pairs in a process execution.
    
    Parameters:
    activity_pairs (dict): A dictionary where each key is a tuple of activity labels and each value is a tuple of (average_time, standard_deviation).
    
    Returns:
    temporal_profile (dict): A dictionary representing the estimated temporal profile for the given activity pairs.
    """

    # Convert the activity_pairs dictionary to a pandas DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(activity_pairs)

    # Calculate the average time and standard deviation for each activity pair
    df['average_time'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['average_time'], axis=1)
    df['standard_deviation'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['standard_deviation'], axis=1)

    # Calculate the average time and standard deviation for each activity pair in terms of their predecessors
    df['success_time'] = df['average_time']
    df['success_std'] = df['standard_deviation']

    # Calculate the average time and standard deviation for each activity pair in terms of their successors
    df['prev_activity'] = df['average_time']
    df['prev_std'] = df['standard_deviation']

    # Assign estimated average time and standard deviation based on the estimated success/failure time
    df['estimated_average_time'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['success_time'] if row['success_time'] > row['prev_activity'] else row['prev_activity'], axis=1)
    df['estimated_standard_deviation'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['success_std'] if row['success_std'] > row['prev_std'] else row['prev_std'], axis=1)

    # Fill any missing estimated average or standard deviation values with 0
    df['estimated_average_time'] = df['estimated_average_time'].fillna(0)
    df['estimated_standard_deviation'] = df['estimated_standard_deviation'].fillna(0)

    # Calculate the correlation between estimated average time and standard deviation
    correlation = df['estimated_average_time'].corr(df['estimated_standard_deviation'])

    # Adjust the estimated average time and standard deviation based on the correlation
    df['estimated_average_time'] = df['estimated_average_time'] / correlation
    df['estimated_standard_deviation'] = df['estimated_standard_deviation'] / correlation

    return df


# Example usage
activity_pairs = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (3600, 3600),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 3600),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (3600, 3600),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (3600, 3600),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 3600),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 3600),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (3600, 3600),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (3600, 3600),
    ('AS', 'DT'): (3600, 3600),
    ('DT', 'WS'): (3600, 3600),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (3600, 3600),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (3600, 3600),
    ('AS', 'DT'): (3600, 3600),
    ('DT', 'WS'): (3600, 3600),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (3600, 3600),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (3600, 3600),
    ('AS', 'DT'): (3600, 3600),
}

temporal_profile = estimateTemporalProfile(activity_pairs)
print(temporal_profile)
```

This solution works by first creating a pandas DataFrame from the `activity_pairs` dictionary. It then calculates the average time and standard deviation for each activity pair in both directions (success and failure). To estimate the average time and standard deviation, it calculates the correlation between the estimated values and uses it to adjust the values.

Finally, it prints the estimated temporal profile, which includes tuples of `(average_time, standard_deviation)` for each activity pair. Note that this is an estimation based on the correlation between the actual values and the adjusted values.
