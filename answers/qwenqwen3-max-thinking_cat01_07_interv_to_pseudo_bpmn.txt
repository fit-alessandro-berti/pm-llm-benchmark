**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **1. Overview**
The process begins when an invoice is received (typically via email) and ends when the invoice is scheduled for payment. It involves four primary roles: **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)**, **Purchasing Officer**, **Department Manager**, and **Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor)**. The **Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)** may be consulted for exception resolution but does not execute system tasks. The process includes validation, matching, approvals, and exception handling.

### **2. Participants (Lanes)**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
- *(Optional/Support Role)* **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** – consulted as needed

---

### **3. Start Event**
- **Start**: Invoice received (typically via email)

---

### **4. Main Process Flow**

#### **Step 1: Validate PO Reference (AP Clerk)**
- **Task**: Check if invoice includes a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
- **Decision Gateway (Exclusive)**:
  - **If NO PO number**:
    - **Task**: Send invoice back to supplier requesting PO details.
    - **Loop**: Wait for revised invoice  return to Step 1.
  - **If PO number present**:
    - **Task**: Log invoice into accounting system.

#### **Step 2: Request Goods/Services Receipt Confirmation (AP Clerk  Purchasing Officer)**
- **Task (AP Clerk)**: Forward invoice to Purchasing Officer for confirmation of goods/services receipt and PO alignment.
- **Task (Purchasing Officer)**: Verify invoice details (quantities, pricing, delivery charges) against PO.
- **Decision Gateway (Exclusive)**:
  - **If discrepancy found** (e.g., wrong quantity, pricing error, missing items):
    - **Task**: Contact supplier directly **or** request AP Clerk to hold invoice.
    - **Sub-Decision**: 
      - If issue is resolvable with supplier info  wait for corrected invoice  return to Step 2.
      - If issue **cannot be resolved** (e.g., missing PO, major mismatch):
        - **Task (AP Clerk)**: Escalate to AP Supervisor.
        - **Task (AP Supervisor)**: Investigate; may contact supplier (possibly via SRM), coordinate with department heads, or create retrospective PO.
        - **After resolution**: Return to Step 2 (re-submit to Purchasing for confirmation).
  - **If NO discrepancy**:
    - **Task (Purchasing Officer)**: Send confirmation email to AP Clerk.

#### **Step 3: Invoice-PO Matching (AP Clerk)**
- **Task**: Match invoice line items to PO in accounting system.
- **Decision Gateway (Exclusive)**:
  - **If match successful**:
    - Proceed to Step 4.
  - **If mismatch persists**:
    - **Task**: Email Purchasing to clarify.
    - **If unresolved after clarification**  escalate to AP Supervisor (as in Step 2 exception path).

#### **Step 4: Manager Approval Request (System-triggered)**
- **Task (System)**: Automatically send approval request email to Department Manager with invoice, PO, and Purchasing confirmation.
- **Task (Department Manager)**: Review details.
- **Decision Gateway (Exclusive)**:
  - **If approved**:
    - Proceed to Step 5.
  - **If rejected or suspicious** (e.g., budget deviation, unexpected items):
    - **Task**: Reject or request AP Clerk to hold and investigate.
    - **Investigation** may involve AP Supervisor or SRM.
    - **After resolution**: Return to Step 4 (re-submit for approval).

#### **Step 5: Schedule Payment (AP Clerk)**
- **Task**: Schedule invoice for payment in next payment cycle.
- **End Event**: Invoice paid.

### **5. Artifacts / Data Objects**
- **Invoice** (input; may be revised)
- **Purchase Order (PO)** (reference document)
- **Confirmation Email** (from Purchasing)
- **Approval Notification** (system-generated)
- **Payment Schedule** (output)

---

### **6. Exception Paths & Variations**
- **Missing PO**: Invoice returned to supplier; may later re-enter process with PO.
- **Informal/Non-PO Invoices**: Handled by AP Supervisor via retrospective PO or rejection.
- **Pricing/Quantity Discrepancies**: Resolved via Purchasing, SRM, or AP Supervisor.
- **Manager Rejection**: Rare; triggers re-investigation before re-submission.
- **Escalation Path**: AP Clerk  AP Supervisor  (optionally) SRM or Department Head.

---

### **7. Notes on Ambiguities & Consolidation**
- All interviewees agree that **PO validation is mandatory** before proceeding.
- **Purchasing confirmation** and **invoice-PO matching** are tightly coupled; modeled as sequential but may involve iterative clarification.
- **SRM (Karen)** is not a formal process participant but is consulted ad hoc—represented as an external support role.
- **System automation** (e.g., approval notifications) is acknowledged by multiple stakeholders and included as a system task.

---

### **8. Suggested BPMN Elements Mapping**
- **Pools/Lanes**: One pool (“Invoice Approval Process”) with lanes for each role.
- **Start Event**: Message Start Event (“Invoice Received”).
- **Tasks**: User Tasks for manual steps; Service Task for system notification.
- **Gateways**: Exclusive Gateways for all decision points (PO check, discrepancy check, manager approval).
- **Sequence Flows**: Labeled with conditions (e.g., “PO missing”, “Match OK”, “Discrepancy unresolved”).
- **End Event**: Terminate End Event (“Payment Scheduled”).

This textual model provides sufficient detail for accurate BPMN diagram creation while capturing standard flow, exceptions, roles, and data artifacts as described by stakeholders.
