### Anomalies Identified

**1. Suspiciously Low STDEV for 'R' to 'P' (Receive to Approve):**

The anomaly lies in the average time of **25 hours** with a very low standard deviation of **1 hour**, which is unexpectedly tight given the range of activities involved. This could indicate an enforced schedule or batch processing rather than an organic process flow.

**Possible Reason:** This might be due to rigid operational policies or batch processing where claims are approved in fixed intervals irrespective of the actual claim complexity or need for evaluation.

**Verification Query 1:**  
```
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM submission_date) AS submission_day,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM submission_date) AS submission_year,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp) AS receive_time,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp + INTERVAL '24 hours') AS approve_time
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'R' AND activity_next = 'P'
```

**2. Significantly Long Delay for 'P' to 'N' (Approve to Notify):**

The anomaly here is a **7-day average delay** between the approve and notify steps with a large standard deviation of **2 days**, suggesting inconsistency in processing times.

**Possible Reason:** This could point to backlogs or bottlenecks in the approval process, possibly due to an insufficient number of adjusters or delays in finalizing documentation required for approval.

**Verification Query 2:**  
```
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    MIN(timestamp) AS earliest_notify,
    MAX(timestamp) AS latest_notify
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P' AND activity_next = 'N'
GROUP BY claim_id
ORDER BY earliest_notify ASC, latest_notify DESC;
```

**3. Premature Closure After Assign ('A' to 'C') Without Intermediate Steps:**

The pattern suggests **claims are being closed rapidly after assignment**, potentially bypassing evaluation and approval stages, which is unusual for most insurance claims processes.

**Possible Reason:** This may indicate that certain claims are being expedited for various reasons like urgent customer requests, minor claims, or procedural errors where steps are inadvertently skipped.

**Verification Query 3:**  
```
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS distinct_activities
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'A' AND activity_next IN ('E', 'P')
GROUP BY claim_id
ORDER BY distinct_activities ASC;
```

These SQL queries will help to pinpoint specific claims and identify patterns that deviate from the norm, providing insights into the nature of the process anomalies observed.
