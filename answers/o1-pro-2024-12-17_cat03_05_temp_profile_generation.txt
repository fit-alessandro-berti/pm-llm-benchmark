Below is an example Python dictionary capturing a representative temporal profile for a subset of activity pairs. Times are given in seconds, and these values are purely illustrative estimates tailored to a complex global supply chain scenario. They include both directly consecutive activities (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and pairs of activities that are separated by multiple intermediate steps (e.g., `('SS', 'CA')`):

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct and near-direct successions
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 21600),      # ~1 day avg, ~6h std dev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),     # ~7 days avg, ~1 day std dev
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 14400),      # ~12h avg, ~4h std dev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 28800),      # ~1 day avg, ~8h std dev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 43200),     # ~3 days avg, ~12h std dev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (21600, 7200),       # ~6h avg, ~2h std dev
    ('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 3600),       # ~4h avg, ~1h std dev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),     # ~2 days avg, ~12h std dev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000),   # ~30 days avg, ~10 days std dev

    # Non-consecutive pairs reflecting cumulative delays
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1296000, 259200),   # ~15 days avg, ~3 days std dev
    ('OP', 'PT'): (1728000, 345600),   # ~20 days avg, ~4 days std dev
    ('QI', 'PK'): (432000, 86400),     # ~5 days avg, ~1 day std dev
    ('CA', 'DT'): (1296000, 172800),   # ~15 days avg, ~2 days std dev
    ('SS', 'DT'): (2592000, 432000),   # ~30 days avg, ~5 days std dev
    ('WS', 'AS'): (7776000, 1728000),  # ~90 days avg, ~20 days std dev
}
```

This dictionary represents a plausible temporal profile, capturing average times and their standard deviations for various pairs of activities. The included values illustrate complexity, with some pairs following directly in the process and others separated by multiple intermediate steps.
