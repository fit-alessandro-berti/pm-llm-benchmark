Upon reviewing the event log, **bias manifests primarily through the “ScoreAdjustment” mechanism tied to “CommunityGroup” affiliation and “LocalResident” status**, which systematically advantages applicants who are both local residents *and* members of recognized community groups — particularly the “Highland Civic Darts Club” — while disadvantaging those who lack such affiliations or geographic ties, even when their underlying PreliminaryScore is comparable or superior.

### **Where and How Bias Manifests**

#### 1. **Community-Based Score Adjustment (+10 points)**
- **Trigger**: Membership in “Highland Civic Darts Club” (or presumably other recognized community groups, though only this one appears in the log).
- **Effect**: Applicants C001 and C004 received a +10 point adjustment solely due to their community affiliation, boosting their scores from 710  720 and 690  700 respectively.
- **Impact**: 
  - C004’s score rose from 690 to 700 — still below C003’s unadjusted 715 — yet C004 was **approved** while C003 (715, no adjustment) was **rejected**.
  - This suggests the threshold for approval may be ~700, meaning the +10 adjustment was decisive in tipping C004 into approval territory.

>  **C004 (690 +10  700)  Approved**  
>  **C003 (715 +0  715)  Rejected**

This is a clear case where **a non-credit-related social factor (club membership) overrides objective creditworthiness**, creating inequity.

#### 2. **LocalResident as a Gatekeeper for Adjustment**
- All applicants who received the +10 adjustment were also marked as “LocalResident = TRUE”.
- C003 and C005 are “LocalResident = FALSE” and received no adjustment — even though C005 scored 740 and was approved, and C003 scored 715 and was rejected.
- This implies that **non-local residents are categorically excluded from receiving community-based score boosts**, regardless of merit.

> While C005 was approved with 740 (no adjustment needed), the *lack of eligibility* for adjustment puts non-local applicants at a structural disadvantage if their score is borderline.

#### 3. **Manual Review Does Not Correct for Bias — It Reinforces It**
- Manual reviewers (Underwriters) are presented with *already adjusted scores* (e.g., “720 (Adjusted)” for C001).
- There’s no indication reviewers are aware of, or can override, the source of the adjustment.
- The review step appears procedural — all manually reviewed cases proceed to final decision without score modification or documented rationale challenging the adjustment.

> This embeds the algorithmic bias into human judgment by presenting adjusted scores as factual rather than preferential.

### **Attributes Favoring Certain Groups**

| Attribute             | Favored Group                                | Disadvantaged Group                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| CommunityGroup        | Members of recognized groups (e.g., Darts Club) | No affiliation (“None”)                  |
| LocalResident         | TRUE (locals)                                | FALSE (non-locals)                       |
| Combined Effect       | Local + Community Member  +10 points         | Non-local or no group  no boost         |

### **Implications for Fairness and Equity**

#### 1. **Structural Advantage for Socially Connected Locals**
- Applicants with community ties — which may correlate with socioeconomic status, time in area, or social capital — receive an artificial boost.
- This **rewards social embeddedness rather than financial reliability**, potentially excluding equally or more creditworthy individuals who are new to the area, transient, or unaffiliated (e.g., students, renters, immigrants, or introverts).

#### 2. **Geographic Discrimination**
- Non-local residents are automatically excluded from the scoring benefit, even if they have higher raw scores (C003: 715 vs. C004: 690).
- This could disproportionately affect marginalized or mobile populations who haven’t had time to join local clubs or establish residency.

#### 3. **Opacity and Lack of Contestability**
- The adjustment is labeled vaguely as “+10 (Community)” — no criteria for which groups qualify or why.
- Applicants are not informed that club membership affects their score, reducing transparency and ability to appeal or self-improve.

#### 4. **Threshold Gaming**
- If the approval cutoff is ~700, then the +10 adjustment functions as a “backdoor” to approval for those just below the line — but only if they’re in the “right” social group.
- This turns a supposedly objective scoring system into one influenced by arbitrary social factors.

### **Recommendations for Mitigation**

1. **Eliminate Non-Credit Adjustments**  
    Remove community-based score boosts unless statistically proven to correlate with repayment behavior (and even then, apply transparently and equally).

2. **Decouple Adjustment from Geography**  
    If community engagement is valued, allow non-local applicants to qualify through virtual or non-geographic affiliations.

3. **Transparency in Scoring**  
    Disclose to applicants that group membership affects scoring and allow them to self-report or opt-in.

4. **Reviewer Awareness and Override**  
    Present reviewers with both raw and adjusted scores, and empower them to disregard adjustments based on fairness or context.

5. **Audit for Disparate Impact**  
    Regularly analyze approval rates by CommunityGroup and LocalResident status to detect and correct systemic bias.

### **Conclusion**

The process exhibits **procedural bias** favoring applicants who are local residents and members of specific community groups — a proxy for social privilege rather than credit risk. This undermines the equity of the system by allowing non-financial, socially contingent factors to determine outcomes. Individuals with equal or better financial profiles (like C003) are rejected while less creditworthy but socially connected applicants (like C004) are approved — a textbook example of how “neutral” rules can produce discriminatory outcomes. Fairness requires either eliminating such adjustments or ensuring they are applied equitably, transparently, and based on validated risk factors — not social affiliation.
