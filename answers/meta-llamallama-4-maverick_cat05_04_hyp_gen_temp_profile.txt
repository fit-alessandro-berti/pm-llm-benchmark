### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

The given temporal profile model highlights several potential anomalies in the insurance claim handling process:
1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: Average time is around 25 hours with a very low standard deviation of 1 hour. This is suspiciously consistent and may indicate a rigid or artificial schedule.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: The average delay is 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days, indicating inconsistent notification times.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**: Closure occurs on average 2 hours after assignment, which is quick and might suggest premature closure without proper evaluation.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: Only 5 minutes on average between evaluation and notification is too quick and may indicate skipping of intermediate steps or automated processes without proper checks.
5. **R to E (Receive to Evaluate)** and **E to C (Evaluate to Close)**: While not as extreme, the standard deviation for these transitions is relatively high, indicating variability in the process.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **R to P Anomaly**: The low standard deviation might indicate automated approval processes that occur at fixed intervals rather than upon completion of the previous step.
2. **P to N Anomaly**: The long average delay with high variability could be due to manual notification processes, resource constraints, or prioritization based on claim type or amount.
3. **A to C Anomaly**: Premature closure might be due to incorrect status updates or system glitches that automatically close claims.
4. **E to N Anomaly**: The quick transition could be due to automated notification systems that do not wait for human intervention, potentially skipping necessary steps or reviews.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

#### 1. Identify Claims with Anomalous Time Intervals

```sql
-- Claims where time from Receive to Approve is less than expected
SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_ts - receive_ts)) AS actual_time
FROM (
  SELECT claim_id, 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS receive_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
) AS subquery
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_ts - receive_ts)) < (90000 - 2*3600);  -- More than 2 standard deviations away

-- Claims where time from Approve to Notify is excessively long
SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_ts - approve_ts)) AS actual_time
FROM (
  SELECT claim_id, 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
) AS subquery
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_ts - approve_ts)) > (604800 + 2*172800);  -- More than 2 standard deviations away
```

#### 2. Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters, Claim Types, or Resources

```sql
-- Correlate 'A to C' anomaly with adjuster
SELECT ce.resource, COUNT(*) AS num_claims
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN (
  SELECT claim_id, 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
) AS subquery ON ce.claim_id = subquery.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (subquery.close_ts - subquery.assign_ts)) < 7200  -- Less than 2 hours
AND ce.activity = 'A'
GROUP BY ce.resource
ORDER BY num_claims DESC;

-- Correlate 'P to N' anomaly with claim type
SELECT c.claim_type, COUNT(*) AS num_claims
FROM claims c
JOIN (
  SELECT claim_id, 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
) AS subquery ON c.claim_id = subquery.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (subquery.notify_ts - subquery.approve_ts)) > (604800 + 2*172800)  -- More than 2 standard deviations away
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY num_claims DESC;
```

#### 3. Filter Claims by Specific Conditions

```sql
-- Claims closed immediately after assignment
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce.resource
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
JOIN (
  SELECT claim_id, 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
) AS subquery ON c.claim_id = subquery.claim_id
WHERE subquery.close_ts <= subquery.assign_ts + INTERVAL '2 hour'
AND ce.activity = 'A';

-- Claims where approval to notification takes excessively long
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_ts - approve_ts)) AS delay
FROM claims c
JOIN (
  SELECT claim_id, 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_ts,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
) AS subquery ON c.claim_id = subquery.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_ts - approve_ts)) > (604800 + 2*172800)  -- More than 2 standard deviations away
ORDER BY delay DESC;
```
