To construct the POWL model for the described digital service provisioning process, we'll follow the steps outlined and use the appropriate classes and operators. Here's the Python code to create this model:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Initial steps
SR = Transition(label="Service Request")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# Step 2: Parallel tasks
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

# Step 3: Loop for configuration
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
D_R = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
config_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Step 4: Exclusive choice for deployment
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 5: Final tasks
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")

# Step 6: Final approval
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Construct the root POWL model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, config_loop, deployment_choice, QA, SA, GLA])

# Add edges to establish the partial order
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # CS must follow SR

# DA and ACI are concurrent, so no edge between them
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

root.order.add_edge(DA, config_loop)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, config_loop)

root.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_choice)

# QA and SA are concurrent, so no edge between them
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, QA)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, SA)

root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# The POWL model is now complete and ready for use
```

This code constructs a POWL model that accurately represents the described digital service provisioning process. Let's break down how it adheres to the scenario:

1. The process starts with `SR` (Service Request) followed by `CS` (Contract Setup). This is modeled with a transition from SR to CS.

2. After CS, `DA` (Datacenter Allocation) and `ACI` (Access Control Initialization) can be done concurrently. They are both connected to CS but not to each other, representing their independence.

3. The configuration phase is modeled as a loop (`config_loop`) containing `BNC` (Base Network Configuration) and `D&R` (Debug & Reconfigure). This loop will continue until the configuration is stable.

4. The deployment choice is modeled as an exclusive choice (`deployment_choice`) between `CD` (Containerized Deployment) and `MD` (Monolithic Deployment).

5. The final tasks `QA` (Quality Assurance) and `SA` (Security Audit) are connected to the deployment choice but not to each other, allowing them to be performed concurrently.

6. The final approval step `GLA` (Go-Live Approval) is connected to both QA and SA, ensuring it can only start once both are completed.

This POWL model accurately represents the described process, including all the mandatory steps, the loop for configuration attempts, the exclusive choice for deployment methods, and the partially ordered final tasks.
