In analyzing the provided event log for anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process, we look for deviations from the standard sequence of activities. A typical P2P flow generally follows this order:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**
4. **Receive Goods/Services**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Match Invoice to PO (Three-Way Match)**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

Any deviation from this logical and control-oriented flow can introduce risks such as payment errors, fraud, compliance violations, or operational inefficiencies.

###  **Case 1001 – Standard Flow (No Anomalies)**

**Sequence:**
Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case

 **Conclusion:** This follows the expected P2P workflow without anomalies.

###  **Case 1002 – Anomalies Detected**

####  **Anomaly 1: Issuing PO Before Approval of Purchase Requisition**
- **Issue:** "Issue Purchase Order" occurs **before** "Approve Purchase Requisition."
- **Timestamps:**
  - Create PR: 08:30
  - Issue PO: 08:40
  - Approve PR: 08:00 (later than PO issuance)
- **Problem:** Bypassing approval violates internal controls and increases risk of unauthorized purchases.

####  **Anomaly 2: Releasing Payment Before Receiving Goods**
- **Issue:** "Release Payment" occurs before "Receive Goods."
- **Timestamps:**
  - Vendor Invoice Received: 07:00
  - Release Payment: 07:15
  - Receive Goods: 09:00 (next day)
- **Problem:** Paying before receipt of goods exposes the organization to fraud, overpayment, or non-delivery of items. It also breaks the fundamental three-way matching principle (PO, receipt, invoice).

 **Other Notes:**
- Matching occurred after payment release, which again shows a breakdown in controls.

###  **Case 1003 – Anomalies Detected**

####  **Anomaly 1: Releasing Payment Before Receiving Invoice or Goods**
- **Issue:** "Release Payment" happens **before both** receiving goods and receiving the vendor invoice.
- **Timestamps:**
  - Issue PO: Feb 2, 10:00
  - Release Payment: Feb 8, 11:00
  - Vendor Invoice Received: Feb 9, 12:00
  - Receive Goods: Feb 10, 13:00
- **Problem:** This is highly irregular and risky. Payments should only be made after verifying delivery and matching documents. Premature payments can lead to financial loss, fraud, and lack of audit trail.

####  **Anomaly 2: Invoice Received After Payment**
- **Issue:** Vendor invoice was received **after** payment was released.
- **Problem:** No verification or matching could occur prior to payment—this defeats the purpose of invoice validation and increases exposure to duplicate or incorrect payments.

---

###  **Case 1004 – Anomalies Detected**

####  **Anomaly 1: Receiving Goods Before Issuing Purchase Order**
- **Issue:** "Receive Goods" occurs **before** "Issue Purchase Order."
- **Timestamps:**
  - Create PR: 10:00
  - Approve PR: 10:15
  - Receive Goods: 09:00 (next day)
  - Issue PO: 09:15
- **Problem:** Receiving goods before issuing a PO indicates that procurement was not properly initiated. This may point to informal procurement practices, bypassing contracts or approvals, or missing documentation.

 **Other Notes:**
- While the rest of the steps follow logically after the PO is issued, the early receipt of goods remains a major red flag.

##  Summary of Anomalies

| Case ID | Type of Anomaly | Description |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| 1002 | Control Violation | PO issued before PR approval |
| 1002 | Risky Behavior | Payment released before goods received |
| 1002 | Process Breakdown | Invoice matched after payment |
| 1003 | High Risk | Payment released before invoice and goods |
| 1003 | Compliance Risk | Invoice received after payment |
| 1004 | Procedural Error | Goods received before PO issued |

---

##  Why These Are Problematic

1. **Financial Risk:** Early payments without proper matching or receipt verification increase the risk of fraud, overpayment, or paying for undelivered goods.
2. **Compliance Issues:** Skipping approvals or matching steps violates internal controls and auditing standards.
3. **Operational Inefficiencies:** Disordered processes can cause delays, rework, disputes with vendors, and difficulty in reconciliation.
4. **Audit Trail Gaps:** Deviations from standard flows make it difficult to trace and justify transactions during audits.

---

##  Recommendations

- Implement automated workflow systems to enforce task sequences.
- Require mandatory approvals before proceeding to next steps.
- Use three-way matching logic in ERP systems to prevent early payments.
- Monitor and flag anomalies in real-time through process mining tools.
- Train staff on standard P2P procedures and consequences of skipping steps.
