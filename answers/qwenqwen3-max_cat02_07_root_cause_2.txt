### 1. **Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Durations**

To identify performance issues, we calculate the **total duration** for each case — from “Submit Claim” to “Close Claim”.

- **Case 2001**:  
  Start: 2024-04-01 09:00  End: 2024-04-01 10:30  **Duration: 1.5 hours**

- **Case 2002**:  
  Start: 2024-04-01 09:05  End: 2024-04-02 11:00  **Duration: 25.9 hours (~1 day 2 hours)**

- **Case 2003**:  
  Start: 2024-04-01 09:10  End: 2024-04-03 09:30  **Duration: 48.3 hours (~2 days 30 minutes)**

- **Case 2004**:  
  Start: 2024-04-01 09:20  End: 2024-04-01 10:45  **Duration: 1.4 hours**

- **Case 2005**:  
  Start: 2024-04-01 09:25  End: 2024-04-04 14:30  **Duration: 77.1 hours (~3 days 5 hours)**

>  **Cases with significant performance issues: 2002, 2003, and 2005**  
> — 2002: ~26 hours (Medium complexity)  
> — 2003: ~48 hours (High complexity)  
> — 2005: ~77 hours (High complexity)

Case 2001 and 2004 (both Low complexity) complete within 1.5 hours — these are the baseline for “normal” performance.

### 2. **Analyze Attributes to Determine Root Causes**

#### A. **Complexity Level**

- **Low Complexity (2001, 2004)**:  
  - No “Request Additional Documents” step.  
  - Duration: ~1.5 hours.

- **Medium Complexity (2002)**:  
  - 1 “Request Additional Documents”  customer response took ~18 hours (14:00 Day 1  10:00 Day 2).  
  - Duration: ~26 hours.

- **High Complexity (2003, 2005)**:  
  - **2003**: 2 “Request Additional Documents” events (11:00 and 17:00 on Day 1), approval next day at 16:00  indicates back-and-forth or delays in gathering docs.  
  - **2005**: 3 “Request Additional Documents” events over 3 days  major delays in document collection.  
  - Durations: 48 and 77 hours respectively.

>  **Finding**: Higher complexity strongly correlates with longer durations, primarily due to multiple rounds of document requests and longer waiting periods between activities.

#### B. **Region**

- **Region A (2001, 2003, 2004)**:  
  - 2001 (Low): 1.5 hrs — fast  
  - 2003 (High): 48 hrs — slow  
  - 2004 (Low): 1.4 hrs — fast  
   Region A handles both fast and slow cases — performance seems tied to complexity, not region.

- **Region B (2002, 2005)**:  
  - 2002 (Medium): 26 hrs  
  - 2005 (High): 77 hrs  
   Again, duration increases with complexity. No evidence that Region B is inherently slower — 2002 and 2005 are both high/medium complexity.

>  **Finding**: Region is **not** a primary root cause. Both regions show similar patterns — duration increases with complexity.

#### C. **Resource**

- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B)**:  
  - Handled 2002 (Medium, 26 hrs, 1 doc request) and 2005 (High, 77 hrs, 3 doc requests).  
   The difference in duration is likely due to claim complexity and repeated requests, not Adjuster_Lisa’s performance.

- **Adjuster_Mike (Region A)**:  
  - Handled 2001 (Low, 1.5 hrs, no doc requests) and 2003 (High, 48 hrs, 2 doc requests).  
   Again, complexity explains the difference.

- **Managers**:  
  - Manager_Ann handled 2001, 2002, 2004 — all approved quickly once docs were ready.  
  - Manager_Bill handled 2003 and 2005 — approvals came only after multiple document rounds, suggesting he’s waiting for completeness, not causing delay.

- **Finance Team**:  
  - Finance_Alan (Region A): Paid 2001 in 15 min, 2003 in 17 hrs after approval — delay due to approval happening at 16:00, payment next morning.  
  - Finance_Carl (Region B): Paid 2002 in 45 min, 2005 in 4 hrs — reasonable given 2005’s approval at 10:00, payment at 14:00.

>  **Finding**: No single resource is consistently slow. Delays occur upstream (document collection), not at approval or payment.

#### D. **“Request Additional Documents” Activity — The Real Bottleneck**

- Cases without this step (2001, 2004): < 2 hours.
- Cases with 1 request (2002): ~26 hours — mostly waiting for customer response.
- Cases with 2–3 requests (2003, 2005): 2–3+ days — multiple cycles of requests indicate either:
  - Poor initial evaluation (missing info not caught early)
  - Customer delays or difficulty providing documents
  - Lack of clear communication or standardized checklists

>  **Root Cause Identified**:  
> The **number of “Request Additional Documents” events** — driven by **claim complexity** — is the primary contributor to extended case durations. High-complexity claims require multiple rounds of back-and-forth, which introduces waiting time and process fragmentation.

---

### 3. **Proposed Explanations and Mitigation Strategies**

####  Why These Attributes Contribute to Delays:

- **High Complexity Claims**:  
  Inherently require more information, but the current process handles them reactively — documents are requested one at a time after initial evaluation, leading to ping-pong delays.

- **Resource/Region Not at Fault**:  
  The same adjusters handle both fast and slow cases — their performance is consistent relative to claim type. The issue is systemic, not individual.

- **Multiple Document Requests**:  
  Each request triggers a customer interaction loop that may take hours or days to resolve. Three requests compound the delay.

---

####  Recommendations to Mitigate Root Causes:

1. **Proactive Document Checklist for High-Complexity Claims**  
    At “Submit Claim” or “Evaluate Claim” stage, auto-generate and send a *complete* document checklist based on claim complexity.  
    Reduces back-and-forth by front-loading information gathering.

2. **Tiered Evaluation Process**  
    Route High-complexity claims to senior adjusters or specialized teams with authority to request all documents upfront.  
    Medium-complexity claims get a standard checklist. Low-complexity skip document requests entirely.

3. **Customer Portal with Real-Time Upload & Validation**  
    Allow customers to upload documents via portal with automated validation (e.g., “You’re missing a police report”).  
    Reduces manual follow-up and accelerates document completeness.

4. **SLA Tracking & Escalation for Document Requests**  
    Set SLAs for customer response (e.g., 24 hrs). Automate reminders. Escalate to supervisor or send pre-filled forms if no response.  
    Prevents cases from stalling silently.

5. **Process Mining & Feedback Loop**  
    Use this event log data to train a model that predicts required documents based on claim type, region, and historical patterns.  
    Continuously improve the checklist and routing logic.

6. **Performance Metric Refinement**  
    Don’t blame adjusters for long durations — instead, track “number of document request cycles” and “time between request and submission” as KPIs.  
    Focus improvement efforts on reducing cycles, not speeding up individual tasks.

---

###  Summary

- **Performance Issue Cases**: 2002 (Medium), 2003 (High), 2005 (High) — durations 26 to 77 hours.
- **Root Cause**: High claim complexity leading to multiple “Request Additional Documents” cycles, causing cumulative delays.
- **Not Caused By**: Specific regions or resources — they handle both fast and slow cases appropriately.
- **Solution**: Front-load document collection with intelligent checklists, automate customer interactions, and reduce reactive follow-ups.

By addressing the document request bottleneck, the organization can reduce average case duration by 50–80% for medium and high complexity claims — without adding staff or changing regions.
