**Analysis of Performance Issues in Insurance Claims Processing**

### **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Durations**

We calculate the total case duration (from **Submit Claim** to **Close Claim**) for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time           | End Time             | Total Duration |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 2001   | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | **1.5 hours**  |
| 2002   | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | **~26 hours**  |
| 2003   | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | **~48.3 hours**|
| 2004   | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | **1.4 hours**  |
| 2005   | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | **~89 hours**  |

**Cases with performance issues**:  
- **Case 2002** (~26 hours)  
- **Case 2003** (~48 hours)  
- **Case 2005** (~89 hours)  

These are **significantly longer** than Cases 2001 and 2004 (<2 hours), both of which are **Low Complexity** and completed within a single day.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis Using Attributes**

#### **A. Complexity Level**
- **Low Complexity** cases (2001, 2004):  
  - No “Request Additional Documents” step.  
  - Completed in <2 hours.  
- **Medium Complexity** (2002):  
  - One “Request Additional Documents”  ~26-hour duration.  
- **High Complexity** (2003, 2005):  
  - **Multiple** “Request Additional Documents” events:  
    - Case 2003: **2 requests** (11:00 and 17:00 on Day 1)  
    - Case 2005: **3 requests** (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3)  
  - Long gaps between requests and final approval (e.g., Case 2005: 3 days between first request and approval).  

 **Conclusion**: **High complexity strongly correlates with longer durations**, primarily due to **repeated document requests** and **delays in receiving or processing additional information**.

---

#### **B. Resource Analysis**

- **Adjuster_Mike** (Case 2003, High Complexity, Region A):  
  - Issued 2 document requests on the same day.  
  - Approval delayed until next day (Manager_Bill).  
  - Total duration: ~48 hours — **long but less than Case 2005**.

- **Adjuster_Lisa** (Cases 2002 [Medium], 2005 [High], both Region B):  
  - Case 2002: 1 request  ~26 hours.  
  - Case 2005: **3 repeated requests over 3 days**  ~89 hours.  
  - Notably, **no approval occurs until Day 4**, suggesting either:  
    - Delay in receiving documents from claimant, **or**  
    - **Inefficient follow-up** or **bottleneck in Lisa’s workflow**.

- **Managers**:  
  - **Manager_Ann** approves quickly (same day or next morning).  
  - **Manager_Bill** (Cases 2003, 2005) approves only after full documentation is received, but **only acts after long delays** — possibly due to waiting, not personal delay.

 **Conclusion**: While **Adjuster_Lisa** handles both medium and high complexity cases, the **proliferation of repeated document requests in Case 2005** suggests a potential **inefficiency in her handling of high-complexity claims** (e.g., unclear initial requests, poor coordination, or lack of escalation).

---

#### **C. Region Analysis**

- **Region A**:  
  - Cases 2001 (Low): fast  
  - Case 2003 (High): ~48 hours — **long but better than Region B’s high-complexity case**.

- **Region B**:  
  - Case 2002 (Medium): ~26 hours  
  - Case 2004 (Low): fast  
  - Case 2005 (High): **~89 hours — worst performer**

 **Conclusion**: **Region B shows disproportionately longer durations for complex claims**, especially Case 2005. This may indicate:
- **Less experienced staff** in handling complex cases,
- **Poor internal coordination**,
- **Slower customer response** in that region, or
- **Inadequate support systems** (e.g., no automated reminders for pending documents).

### **3. Synthesis: Root Causes & Recommendations**

####  **Primary Root Causes**
1. **High Complexity  Multiple Document Requests  Extended Cycle Time**  
   - Complex claims inherently require more info, but **repeated requests** (especially on separate days) suggest **incomplete or unclear initial requests**, leading to back-and-forth delays.

2. **Region B + Adjuster_Lisa Handling High Complexity = Performance Bottleneck**  
   - Adjuster_Lisa issued **3 separate document requests over 3 days** in Case 2005, indicating:
     - Failure to collect all needed documents upfront,
     - Lack of a checklist for complex claims,
     - No escalation path when documents are delayed.

3. **No Standardized Handling for Complex Claims Across Regions**  
   - Region A (Adjuster_Mike) managed high complexity in 2 days; Region B took 4 days — **inconsistent process execution**.

---

###  **Recommendations to Mitigate Performance Issues**

1. **Implement a Tiered Document Checklist by Complexity Level**  
   - For **High Complexity** claims, require adjusters to submit a **comprehensive initial document request** using a standardized checklist.  
   - Reduces need for repeated follow-ups.

2. **Introduce SLAs and Escalation Protocols**  
   - If documents aren’t received within **24–48 hours**, automatically escalate or trigger customer reminders.  
   - Prevents cases like 2005 from stalling for days.

3. **Provide Targeted Training for Adjusters in Region B**  
   - Focus on **complex claim assessment** and **effective communication** to minimize repeated requests.  
   - Benchmark against best practices from Region A (e.g., Adjuster_Mike’s approach).

4. **Monitor Adjuster Performance by Complexity Tier**  
   - Track metrics:  
     - Avg. # of document requests per case,  
     - Time between request and approval,  
     - Case duration by adjuster × complexity.  
   - Identify outliers early (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa’s pattern in high-complexity cases).

5. **Enable Parallel Processing Where Possible**  
   - For high-complexity claims, allow **partial validation** while waiting for documents, so approval isn’t entirely blocked.

---

### **Final Summary**

- **Longest cases**: 2005 > 2003 > 2002 — all involve **Medium/High Complexity**.  
- **Key driver**: **Repeated “Request Additional Documents”** due to incomplete initial assessment.  
- **Regional disparity**: **Region B** underperforms on complex claims, likely due to **adjuster workflow inefficiencies**.  
- **Solution focus**: Standardize complex claim handling, reduce iterative requests, and strengthen support in underperforming regions.

By addressing these root causes, the insurer can significantly reduce case cycle times—especially for high-value, complex claims that most impact customer satisfaction and operational cost.
