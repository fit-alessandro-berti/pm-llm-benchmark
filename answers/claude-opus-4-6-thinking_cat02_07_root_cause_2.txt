## 1. Case Duration Summary

| Case | Start | End | Total Duration | Complexity | Region | # Doc Requests |
|------|-------|-----|---------------|------------|--------|:--------------:|
| 2001 | Apr 1, 09:00 | Apr 1, 10:30 | **~1.5 hrs** | Low | A | 0 |
| 2004 | Apr 1, 09:20 | Apr 1, 10:45 | **~1.4 hrs** | Low | B | 0 |
| 2002 | Apr 1, 09:05 | Apr 2, 11:00 | **~26 hrs** | Medium | B | 1 |
| 2003 | Apr 1, 09:10 | Apr 3, 09:30 | **~48 hrs** | High | A | 2 |
| 2005 | Apr 1, 09:25 | Apr 4, 14:30 | **~77 hrs** | High | B | 3 |

**Cases 2003 and 2005 are clear outliers**, taking roughly 32× and 51× longer than the low-complexity baseline. Case 2002 (medium complexity) is a moderate outlier at ~26 hours.

## 2. Root-Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Primary Driver: Claim Complexity & Repeated Document Requests

This is the **dominant root cause**. The correlation is nearly perfect:

| Complexity | Avg Duration | Avg # of Doc Requests |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Low        | ~1.5 hrs    | 0                    |
| Medium     | ~26 hrs     | 1                    |
| High       | ~63 hrs     | 2.5                  |

Each additional round of "Request Additional Documents" introduces a **~19–30 hour delay** (approximately one calendar day per round), because the process must wait for the customer to respond and the adjuster to review before proceeding.

**Detailed delay breakdown for Case 2005 (worst performer):**

| Transition | Delay |
|---|---|
| Evaluate  1st Doc Request | 1 hr 40 min |
| 1st  2nd Doc Request | **~29.5 hrs** |
| 2nd  3rd Doc Request | **~22 hrs** |
| 3rd Doc Request  Approve | **~19 hrs** |
| Approve  Pay  Close | 4.5 hrs |

> **Finding:** Over 90% of the total lead time in high-complexity cases is consumed by waiting between successive document request rounds.

### 2.2 Secondary Driver: Resource Behavior

#### Adjuster patterns
- **Adjuster_Lisa** (Cases 2002, 2004, 2005): On the high-complexity Case 2005, she issued **three** separate document requests over **three days**, suggesting documents were requested piecemeal rather than all at once.
- **Adjuster_Mike** (Cases 2001, 2003): On the high-complexity Case 2003, he issued **two** requests but both on the **same day** (11:00 and 17:00), which compressed the cycle somewhat.

> **Finding:** Adjuster_Lisa's incremental approach to document collection on Case 2005 added an estimated extra full day compared to Adjuster_Mike's approach on a similarly complex case.

#### Manager patterns
- **Manager_Ann** approves low- and medium-complexity claims with very short delays ( 20 hrs even with a doc request cycle).
- **Manager_Bill** exclusively handles the two high-complexity approvals. In both cases, there is a **19–23 hour gap** between the last document request and approval, suggesting either that high-complexity approvals require deeper review or that Manager_Bill has a longer review turnaround.

> **Finding:** It is unclear whether Manager_Bill is inherently slower or simply assigned the harder cases, but his involvement is correlated with extended approval times.

### 2.3 Region as a Factor

| Region | Cases | Avg Duration |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| A      | 2001 (Low), 2003 (High) | ~25 hrs |
| B      | 2004 (Low), 2002 (Med), 2005 (High) | ~35 hrs |

Region B appears slightly slower on average, but this is **confounded with complexity** — Region B happens to include the most extreme case (2005, High, 3 doc rounds). Low-complexity cases in *both* regions complete in under 2 hours. **Region is not an independent root cause** in this dataset.

## 3. Summary of Root Causes

| Root Cause | Impact | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **High Complexity  multiple document request rounds** | **Critical** — each round adds ~1 full calendar day | Cases 2003 (2 rounds  48 hrs) and 2005 (3 rounds  77 hrs) vs. Low cases at ~1.5 hrs |
| **Piecemeal document requests (resource behavior)** | **Significant** — unnecessary extra round(s) | Adjuster_Lisa requested docs 3 separate times for Case 2005 instead of consolidating |
| **Manager_Bill's approval turnaround on complex cases** | **Moderate** — 19–23 hr approval delays | Both high-complexity approvals by Manager_Bill show ~1-day lag after final documentation |
| **Region** | **Not significant** independently | Duration differences explained by complexity mix, not geography |

## 4. Recommendations

### A. Reduce Document Request Iterations (Highest Priority)
- **Implement a comprehensive document checklist** for medium- and high-complexity claims so that adjusters request *all* needed documents in a **single, upfront request** rather than iterating.
- **Estimated impact:** Eliminating even one round could save ~24 hours per high-complexity case (a ~30% reduction).

### B. Improve Adjuster Training & Standardization
- Provide **Adjuster_Lisa** (and others) with guidelines or decision-support tools for high-complexity claims to identify documentation needs early during evaluation.
- Introduce a **peer review or senior adjuster consultation** before issuing the first document request on complex cases.

### C. Accelerate Approvals for Complex Claims
- Investigate whether **Manager_Bill's** turnaround reflects capacity constraints or process complexity. If workload-based, consider **load-balancing** high-complexity approvals across managers.
- Introduce **escalation SLAs**: e.g., high-complexity claims should be approved within 4 business hours of receiving complete documentation.

### D. Parallelize Where Possible
- Allow **preliminary approval or pre-authorization** while final documents are being gathered, so that the Pay step can be triggered faster once all documents arrive.
- Enable **automated reminders to customers** to submit requested documents promptly, reducing the wait time between request and response.

### E. Monitor with Process KPIs
- Track **number of document request rounds per case** as a key process indicator.
- Set **lead-time thresholds** by complexity tier (e.g., Low < 4 hrs, Medium < 1 day, High < 2 days) and flag deviations in real time.
