Below is a list of 20 relevant questions that could be used to analyze and evaluate the process described, along with a confidence score (on a scale of 1-10, where 10 represents the highest confidence that the question is relevant and valuable for insight generation).

### General Process Performance and Efficiency
1. **What are the top three most frequent process variants, and how do their frequencies compare?** (Confidence: 10)  
2. **What is the average performance time across all process variants for declarations that reach the "Payment Handled" stage?** (Confidence: 10)  
3. **Which process variant has the longest performance time (excluding outliers), and why does it take longer than others?** (Confidence: 9)  
4. **What is the average performance time difference between a declaration approved in the first cycle versus declarations rejected and resubmitted?** (Confidence: 9)  
5. **How does the performance compare between declarations handled by the Administration versus PRE_APPROVER versus BUDGET OWNER?** (Confidence: 8)

### Rejection Patterns
6. **What percentage of declarations are rejected (at least once) during the process?** (Confidence: 10)  
7. **Which stage has the highest percentage of rejections, and what impact does this have on overall performance?** (Confidence: 10)  
8. **How often are declarations escalated to FINAL_APPROVED status after a rejection by ADMINISTRATION?** (Confidence: 9)  
9. **Is there a significant difference in processing time for declarations that experience multiple sequential rejections (e.g., ADMINISTRATION -> EMPLOYEE -> ADMINISTRATION)?** (Confidence: 9)  
10. **What percentage of rejected declarations are successfully resubmitted and reach the "Payment Handled" stage?** (Confidence: 9)

### Process Optimization
11. **What is the impact on performance time when fewer approval levels are involved in a process variant?** (Confidence: 10)  
12. **Which approvals contribute the most to delays in performance time across variants?** (Confidence: 9)  
13. **What is the frequency and performance of exceptional or edge-case process variants (frequency < 10), and how can these variants be optimized?** (Confidence: 8)  
14. **Is there any relationship between the frequency of approvals/rejections and the overall performance time of declarations?** (Confidence: 8)

### Impact of Resubmission
15. **How does the frequency of resubmissions (across all variants) affect the total workload on EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, and other stakeholders in the approval process?** (Confidence: 9)  
16. **Is there an upper limit (threshold) where multiple rejections result in declarations being abandoned?** (Confidence: 8)  
17. **What is the average performance time for cases with only one rejection versus cases with multiple sequential rejections?** (Confidence: 9)

### Roles and Responsibilities
18. **Which approval role (e.g., SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER) has the highest impact on the overall process timeline?** (Confidence: 9)  
19. **How do the activities of roles differ in terms of performance across their respective stages (e.g., ADMINISTRATION vs. PRE_APPROVER)?** (Confidence: 8)  
20. **What role contributes most to rejected declarations, and can targeted training or process improvement reduce rejections?** (Confidence: 9)

These questions aim to uncover process inefficiencies, analyze rejection patterns, evaluate role responsibilities, and identify opportunities for improvement. The confidence scores are assigned based on relevance, ability to provide actionable insights, and practical use in improving the overall process.
