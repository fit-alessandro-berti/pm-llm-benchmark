Here's a **Python dictionary** representing the **Log Skeleton** for the **order fulfillment process** described in the scenario. It encodes the **declarative constraints** based on the logical flow and rules of the process.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')
    },
    'always_after': set(),
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},          # Receive Order occurs exactly once
        'CA': {1},          # Check Availability occurs exactly once
        'RI': {1},          # Reserve Items occurs exactly once
        'PI': {1},          # Pick Items occurs exactly once
        'QC': {1},          # Quality Check occurs exactly once
        'PO': {1},          # Pack Order occurs exactly once
        'GSL': {1},         # Generate Shipping Label occurs exactly once
        'D': {1},           # Dispatch occurs exactly once
        'IC': {1},          # Invoice Customer occurs exactly once
        'RP': {1}           # Record Payment occurs exactly once
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Constraints:

- **`always_before`**: Ensures that certain activities must occur **before** others. For example, `CA` must happen before `RI`, and `RI` before `PI`, etc.
- **`directly_follows`**: Ensures that the activities must be **immediately followed** by the next activity in the sequence.
- **`activ_freq`**: Specifies that each activity occurs **exactly once** per case. This is appropriate for a linear, deterministic process.
- **`equivalence`**, **`always_after`**, and **`never_together`** are left empty because there are no such constraints in this scenario.

---

### Notes:
- This model assumes a **linear workflow** with no parallelism or alternative paths.
- If the process had parallel or alternative paths, we would need to add more constraints.
- If some activities could occur multiple times (e.g., multiple quality checks), we would adjust the `activ_freq` accordingly.

Let me know if you'd like a version with **parallel paths** or **optional activities**!
