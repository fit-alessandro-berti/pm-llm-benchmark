   - **Branch:** The request is initiated at a branch by a walk-in customer.

2. **Verify Initial Documents:**
   - This activity involves the initial verification of documents, typically done when the request is first received.

3. **Verify Documents (Physical):**
   - This activity specifically indicates physical verification of documents, which is relevant when the customer is present at the branch.

4. **Re-Verify Documents:**
   - This activity indicates a re-verification of documents, typically after additional information has been provided or adjustments have been made.

5. **Call Customer for Missing Docs:**
   - This activity involves calling the customer to request additional documents that are missing.

6. **Call Customer for Clarification:**
   - This activity involves calling the customer to clarify discrepancies or additional details needed.

7. **Call Customer to Return:**
   - This activity involves calling the customer to return to the branch, typically if they have stepped out.

8. **Follow-Up Call to Confirm Adjustments:**
   - This activity involves a follow-up call to confirm that the adjustments made internally have been communicated to the customer.

9. **Adjust Account Internally:**
   - This activity involves internal adjustments made to the customer's account details.

10. **Submit Additional Documents:**
    - This activity involves the customer submitting additional documents required for the request.

11. **Approve Request:**
    - This activity indicates the final approval given by the supervisor, ensuring the request is completed and can proceed.

By renaming the activities, the revised log provides a clearer and more context-specific view of the process, making it easier to understand the flow and the roles of each activity within the support workflow.
