## Message Flows
- From Supplier to AP: Original invoice

- From AP to Purchasing: Invoice for verification
- From Purchasing to AP: Confirmation or discrepancy notification
- From System to Department Manager: Approval request notification
- From Department Manager to System: Approval or rejection

## Notes on Process Variations
1. In some cases, the Purchasing Officer may contact suppliers directly about discrepancies rather than routing through AP.
2. For services contracted informally without a PO, the AP Supervisor may work with department heads to create a retrospective PO.
3. The Department Manager may occasionally request to hold an invoice for investigation even if all prior steps were completed successfully.
4. The Supplier Relationship Manager is involved only for resolving discrepancies with suppliers, not in the standard approval flow.

## Data Objects
- Invoice (original)
- Purchase Order (PO)
- Corrected Invoice
- System Notifications
- Confirmation Emails
