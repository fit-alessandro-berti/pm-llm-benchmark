The event log reveals a **potential bias** in the decision-making process based on **community affiliation**, specifically the **"CommunityGroup"** attribute. This bias manifests in the **PreliminaryScoring** and **FinalDecision** stages, where **local residents who are members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club"** receive an **automatic score adjustment of +10**, while others—whether they are non-local residents or do not belong to a community group—do **not receive this adjustment**.

### **1. Bias in the Scoring Process**

#### **Attribute: CommunityGroup**
- **Favoring Group**: Local residents who are members of the **"Highland Civic Darts Club"**.
- **Adjustment**: A **+10 point adjustment** is automatically applied to their **PreliminaryScore**.
- **Impact**: This adjustment increases the **adjusted score** by 10 points, which may influence the **FinalDecision**.

#### **Example:**
- **Case C001**: A local resident of the Highland Civic Darts Club starts with a **710** score and gets a **+10** adjustment, resulting in a **720** score, which leads to **approval**.
- **Case C003**: A **non-local resident** (LocalResident = FALSE) with a **715** score receives **no adjustment** and is **rejected**.
- **Case C005**: A **non-local resident** with a **740** score receives **no adjustment** and is **approved**, but this is only because the score is already high enough without the adjustment.

#### **Implication**:
- Individuals who are **not members of the Highland Civic Darts Club** or are **non-local residents** may be **disproportionately disadvantaged** in the scoring process, **even if their underlying creditworthiness is similar** to those who receive the adjustment.
- This **systemic bias** may lead to **unequal treatment** and **reduced fairness** in the decision-making process.

### **2. Bias in the Final Decision**

#### **Attribute: Adjusted Score**
- The **FinalDecision** appears to be **influenced by the adjusted score**, which includes the **+10 adjustment** for Highland Civic Darts Club members.
- For example:
  - **C001**: Approved with a **720 (Adjusted)** score.
  - **C002**: Approved with a **720** score (no adjustment).
  - **C003**: Rejected with a **715** score (no adjustment).
  - **C004**: Approved with a **700 (Adjusted)** score (due to +10).
  - **C005**: Approved with a **740** score (no adjustment).

#### **Implication**:
- The **adjusted score** may be the **primary determinant** of whether an application is **approved or rejected**, even when the **raw score** is comparable.
- This could **favor individuals from specific community groups** and **disadvantage others** with similar credit profiles but **no community affiliation**.

### **3. Implications for Fairness and Equity**

- **Unfair Advantage**: The **+10 adjustment** for members of the Highland Civic Darts Club gives them an **unfair advantage**, potentially **skewing outcomes in their favor**.
- **Systemic Inequality**: Non-local residents or those not affiliated with the Highland Civic Darts Club may be **systematically disadvantaged**, even if their **creditworthiness is similar**.
- **Lack of Transparency**: The **rules engine** and **scoring engine** may not clearly communicate how **community affiliation** affects the final decision, leading to **lack of transparency** and **difficulty in challenging decisions**.
- **Potential Discrimination**: This bias could be seen as a form of **discrimination**, especially if the **community group affiliation** is not directly related to **creditworthiness** or **risk assessment**.

### **4. Recommendations for Mitigating Bias**

1. **Review and Audit Scoring Logic**: Ensure that **community affiliation** is not being used as a proxy for **creditworthiness** unless it is directly tied to **risk assessment**.
2. **Increase Transparency**: Clearly document and communicate how **adjustments** are applied and what **criteria** are used to determine them.
3. **Implement Fairness Checks**: Use **fairness metrics** (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity) to assess whether the **scoring and decision-making process** treats all groups equally.
4. **Allow for Manual Review**: Ensure that **manual reviewers** are trained to **identify and mitigate bias** in the process.
5. **Consider Alternative Criteria**: If **community affiliation** is not directly related to **creditworthiness**, consider **removing or adjusting** the **+10 adjustment** to avoid **unfair advantage**.

### **Conclusion**

The **bias** in this process is **manifested through the automatic +10 score adjustment** for members of the **Highland Civic Darts Club**, which **favors local residents and community group members** over **non-local residents or those without community affiliations**. This can **undermine the fairness and equity** of the final decisions, especially when **underlying creditworthiness is similar**. Addressing this bias is crucial for ensuring **equal treatment and compliance with ethical and regulatory standards**.
