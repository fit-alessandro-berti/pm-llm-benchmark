Violating cases: 2, 3, and 5.
Cases 1 and 4 conform.

Explanation by case:

Case 1: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close.
Complies with the “sufficient inventory” path and ordering constraints: check before authorize; authorize before package; package before ship; ship before close; close last.

Case 2: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close.
Violations:
- “Package items” occurs before “Authorize payment.” Normative rule: authorize must occur after check and before packaging.
- By implication, shipping then also occurs after an improperly ordered packaging step.

Case 3: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close.
Violations:
- After “Cancel order,” no fulfillment activities should occur. Normative rule: shipping must never occur after cancellation. Here, “Ship order” occurs after “Cancel order.”
- In a cancellation branch, the expected sequence is Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. Having authorized payment prior to cancellation is not explicitly forbidden, but proceeding to ship after cancel is.

Case 4: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.
Complies with the “insufficient inventory” path. No fulfillment steps after cancellation; close is final.

Case 5: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close.
Violations:
- “Package items” is missing before “Ship order.” Normative rule: package must occur after authorization and before shipping. Shipping without packaging violates this prerequisite.
- Close remains last, which is correct, but the missing packaging step makes the case nonconformant.
