1. Analysis of POWL Models in relation to the standard Hire-to-Retire process:  

In the standard Hire-to-Retire process, we have several sequenced activities: 

- Post a job advertisement when starting 
- Screen candidates 
- Conduct interviews 
- Make hiring decisions 
- Onboard new employees 
- Add the new hires to the payroll system 
- Close the case when the employee retires or leaves 

Observe that the standard process requires the activities Post, Screen, Conduct_Interviews, Make_Hiring_Decision, and Close_Case to occur in this order. Onboarding and Payroll Activities occur only once, after the hiring decision.

**POWL Model 1**:

- This model closely follows the standard process flow. The Post transition happens first, leading to Screen, followed by either Interview or a decision, then onboarding, payroll, and finally closing the case. This model, therefore, exhibits very few deviations from the standard process.

**POWL Model 2**:  

- The Post job advertisement transition comes first, followed by Screening and Interviews, Decision, Onboard, as well as a Switch Operator represented by loop_onboarding and the XOR - payroll operator, these two transitions are meant to either onboard an employee and skip payroll or pay into payroll and skip onboarding. Neither the post or onboarding workforce hires are interrupted by the looping operators, so the process remains fairly within the standards of norms.

2. Anomalies identified in each model:  

**POWL Model 1**:  

- There seems to be no inherent anomalies in this model. All activities are ordered in the sequence they are hypothetically expected to follow in the hiring process, and there are no looping structures influencing the process's linear flow.

**POWL Model 2**:  

- The anomaly in this model arises from the design of the Switch Operator, which allows for an onboarding process or the payroll process to occur under the condition that one must happen, not the other. In a standard process, both onboarding and payroll processes must be executed after decisions are made.
- Normally, onboarding and payroll processes are independent, not mutually exclusive, implying that there should be scenarios where an employee is both onboarded and paid simultaneously.

3. Belief which model more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process:  

**POWL Model 1**:

- This model more closely aligns with the normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process as it follows the standard order of post, screen, interviews, decide, onboard, payroll, and close steps. It respects the sequence of activities and does not contain any anomalous behavior or loop structures that could interrupt the flow or conditions of the process.

**Justification**:

- Despite the absence of strict loop operators, the legitimate onboarding and payroll activities in POWL Model 1 are carried out consistently with standard expectations, after the decision-making phase indicated by "Decision." The payroll operator consistently follows the onboard operator, conforming to typical hiring workflows. 

- In POWL Model 2, the construct of a Switch Operator employing an XOR methodology creates a conditional paradox in the expected hiring process; it forces the onboarding or payroll process to act as an exclusive route, contradicting typical business operations where onboarding and payroll are concomitant but not mutually exclusive.

- The fidelity to well-established business workflows and compliance with standard order of activities in POWL Model 1 affirms its superior adherence to a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process, ensuring coherence and process integrity are maintained without introducing complex, disruptive logic conditions.
