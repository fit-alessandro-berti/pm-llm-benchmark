To identify cases with performance issues and uncover root causes, we’ll analyze the **duration** of each case by calculating the time between the first and last event per case.

###  **Step 1: Calculate Case Duration**

| Case ID | First Event | Last Event | Duration (hh:mm) |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00 | 2024-04-01 10:30 | **1h 30m** |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05 | 2024-04-02 11:00 | **25h 55m** |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10 | 2024-04-03 09:30 | **48h 20m** |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20 | 2024-04-01 10:45 | **1h 25m** |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25 | 2024-04-04 14:30 | **107h 5m** |

---

###  **Step 2: Identify Cases with Performance Issues**

- **2002**: 25h 55m  **Delayed due to Request Additional Documents**
- **2003**: 48h 20m  **Delayed due to multiple Requests for Additional Documents**
- **2005**: 107h 5m  **Heavily delayed due to multiple Requests for Additional Documents**

These are the **top 3 underperforming cases**.

###  **Step 3: Analyze Root Causes**

####  **Case 2002**
- **Region**: B
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Issue**: One Request for Additional Documents
- **Likely Cause**: While only one request was made, the delay between Evaluate Claim (09:45) and Request Documents (14:00) suggests a **processing delay** at the adjuster level.
- **Mitigation**: Improve adjuster responsiveness or introduce SLA timers for document requests.

####  **Case 2003**
- **Region**: A
- **Complexity**: High
- **Issue**: **2 Requests for Additional Documents**
- **Likely Cause**: High complexity leads to **non-trivial validation**, but the **tight clustering** of requests (09:10 to 17:00 same day) suggests **inefficient internal communication** rather than external delays.
- **Mitigation**: Streamline internal process for high-complexity claims; consider parallel validation steps.

####  **Case 2005**
- **Region**: B
- **Complexity**: High
- **Issue**: **3 Requests for Additional Documents**
- **Likely Cause**: **High complexity** + **inefficient handling** by adjuster (Lisa). Requests are spread over 3 days, indicating **external validation delays** or **missing documentation** (e.g., medical records, police reports).
- **Mitigation**: Pre-checklists for high-complexity claims; integrate external data sources to reduce back-and-forth.

###  **Attribute-Level Correlation Summary**

| Attribute   | Observed Impact on Duration |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **Region B** | Slightly higher median duration (25–107h vs 1.5–1.5h) |
| **High Complexity** | Strong correlation with multiple document requests and long durations |
| **Resource** | Adjuster_Lisa and Adjuster_Mike appear in delayed cases: potential skill/efficiency gap |

---

###  **Recommendations**

1. **Resource Training & Support**:
   - Provide upskilling for Adjuster_Lisa and Adjuster_Mike in handling high-complexity claims.
   - Introduce a knowledge base or mentorship for new/adjuster-level staff.

2. **Process Optimization**:
   - Create **pre-validation checklists** for high-complexity claims.
   - Add **digital document upload portals** to reduce missing-file delays.

3. **SLA Enforcement**:
   - Set time-based SLAs between Evaluate and Request Documents.
   - Escalate non-compliance automatically.

4. **Regional Performance Monitoring**:
   - Analyze if Region B consistently underperforms due to resource availability or workflow design—possibly shift high-complexity claims to Region A temporarily.

###  **Conclusion**

- **Root causes** are **not** the assigned resources per se, but **inefficient handling of high-complexity claims**, especially when document requests are delayed or repeated.
- **Mitigation** lies in **process redesign**, **resource support**, and **data-driven SLA enforcement**.
