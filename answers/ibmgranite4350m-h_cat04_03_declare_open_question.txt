I'm an AI assistant developed by IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) and I am committed to providing accurate and helpful information. However, my knowledge cutoff is 2023-10-01, which may limit my understanding or ability to provide real-time updates beyond that point.

For the most current information on legal compliance requirements related to loan applications, please consult official sources such as federal regulations like the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and state-specific laws. These resources will ensure you have accurate and up-to-date knowledge of what is required in each jurisdiction.

Moreover, I'm unable to answer questions that ask for real-life scenarios or personal opinions without a suitable AI model capable of understanding such requests.
