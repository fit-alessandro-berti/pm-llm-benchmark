### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To analyze Speedy Parcels' operations using process mining, the first step is to preprocess and integrate data from various sources into a cohesive event log. The following steps outline this process:

- **Standardization of Timestamps:** Ensure all timestamps are consistent (e.g., UTC or local time) across all data sources.
- **Case Identification:** Assign a unique `Case ID` for each vehicle-day combination, linking events related to a specific vehicle's operations on a given day.
- **Activity Labeling:** Standardize activity names across different data sources (e.g., "Depart Depot" from GPS logs should match "Route Assigned" from dispatch logs).
- **Attribute Enrichment:** Merge attributes like `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID`, `Location`, `Speed`, and `Status` into a unified format.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Use imputation techniques or flag missing values for further investigation.

**Challenges:**
- **Data Inconsistencies:** Discrepancies between GPS, scanner, and dispatch records may arise due to delays in recording events or system errors.
- **Granularity Mismatch:** GPS data might have higher temporal resolution than scanner or dispatch logs, requiring aggregation or interpolation.
- **Duplicate Events:** Overlapping events from multiple systems need to be reconciled.

#### **Process Discovery**
Using process discovery algorithms (e.g., Heuristics Miner, Inductive Miner), we can visualize the *actual* delivery process:
- **End-to-End Process:** From depot departure to return, including intermediate activities such as travel, customer stops, failed deliveries, and unplanned stops (e.g., maintenance or traffic delays).
- **Variant Analysis:** Identify common variants (patterns) in delivery routes and sequences to understand typical behaviors versus outliers.

#### **Conformance Checking**
Compare the discovered process model against planned routes from the dispatch system:
- **Sequence Deviations:** Check if actual sequences differ from planned ones (e.g., skipping stops or altering stop order).
- **Unplanned Stops:** Detect unscheduled stops not included in the planned route (e.g., traffic jams, breakdowns).
- **Timing Differences:** Analyze discrepancies between planned and actual durations for travel, service times, and total shift length.

**Tools:** Use conformance checking tools to compute metrics like fitness, precision, and generalization to quantify how well the actual process aligns with the planned one.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
Define KPIs aligned with Speedy Parcels' goals:
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of packages delivered within the requested time window.
- **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Total service time divided by the number of stops.
- **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Proportion of time spent traveling versus interacting with customers.
- **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Measure efficiency in terms of fuel usage.
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of time vehicles are actively delivering versus idle.
- **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** Quantify delays caused by congestion.
- **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Frequency of unsuccessful delivery attempts requiring re-delivery.

#### **Calculating KPIs**
- Extract relevant timestamps and attributes from the event log.
- Aggregate data at the case level (vehicle-day) or package level.
- Use statistical methods to calculate averages, medians, and distributions.

#### **Identifying Bottlenecks**
Use process mining techniques to pinpoint inefficiencies:
- **Resource Bottlenecks:** Analyze driver performance and identify underperforming drivers or overloaded vehicles.
- **Route-Specific Issues:** Compare travel times and delivery success rates across routes to highlight problematic areas.
- **Time-Based Patterns:** Examine peak hours or days with higher delays or failure rates.
- **Activity Dwell Times:** Investigate long dwell times at specific locations (e.g., parking difficulties, customer unavailability).

**Quantification:** Calculate the contribution of each bottleneck to overall inefficiency using sensitivity analysis or impact assessment.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

#### **Potential Root Causes**
- **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Static routes may fail to account for real-time conditions like traffic or construction.
- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Underestimated travel times lead to missed deadlines.
- **Traffic Congestion Patterns:** Recurrent delays in specific zones indicate high-congestion areas.
- **High Variability in Service Time:** Some customers take longer to interact with, causing cascading delays.
- **Vehicle Breakdowns:** Unscheduled maintenance disrupts operations.
- **Driver Behavior:** Differences in driving styles or adherence to schedules affect performance.
- **Failed Delivery Attempts:** Re-deliveries increase costs and reduce punctuality.

#### **Validation Using Process Mining**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes/drivers to identify best practices.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Link traffic data with delay occurrences to confirm congestion impacts.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Investigate prolonged stops to uncover issues like parking challenges or customer availability.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Suboptimal static routing leading to delays.
- **Root Cause Addressed:** Real-time traffic conditions not considered in planning.
- **Process Mining Support:** Analyze historical traffic patterns and their correlation with delays.
- **Expected Impact:** Improved punctuality and reduced travel time, enhancing On-Time Delivery Rate and Vehicle Utilization Rate.

#### **Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** High variability in service time and travel distance.
- **Root Cause Addressed:** Poorly balanced territories cause uneven workloads.
- **Process Mining Support:** Cluster analysis of delivery locations based on historical performance data.
- **Expected Impact:** Balanced workloads reduce average time per stop and improve Fuel Consumption per km/package.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Frequent unscheduled vehicle breakdowns.
- **Root Cause Addressed:** Lack of proactive maintenance based on usage patterns.
- **Process Mining Support:** Analyze vehicle usage logs to predict maintenance needs.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduced downtime and operational disruptions, improving Vehicle Utilization Rate and reducing maintenance costs.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **Accounting for Constraints**
- **Driver Working Hours:** Ensure proposed changes comply with labor regulations and avoid excessive overtime.
- **Vehicle Capacities:** Optimize load distribution to prevent overloading.
- **Customer Time Windows:** Prioritize deliveries with strict time constraints to maintain customer satisfaction.

#### **Continuous Monitoring Plan**
Implement dashboards to track key metrics post-implementation:
- **Delivery Success Rate:** Monitor improvements in punctuality.
- **Route Efficiency Metrics:** Track travel time reductions and fuel savings.
- **Maintenance Alerts:** Flag potential vehicle issues before they escalate.
- **Driver Performance Scores:** Evaluate adherence to optimized routes and schedules.

**Process Views to Track:**
- **Actual vs. Planned Route Comparison:** Highlight deviations and their causes.
- **Bottleneck Heatmaps:** Visualize recurring problem areas.
- **Trend Analysis:** Monitor KPI trends over time to assess sustainability.

By combining process mining insights with actionable strategies, Speedy Parcels can achieve significant improvements in delivery punctuality and cost efficiency while maintaining operational feasibility.
