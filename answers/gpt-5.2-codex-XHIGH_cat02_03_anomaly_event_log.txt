Below is a quick scan of each case against the **standard ProcuretoPay (P2P)** flow:

**Typical P2P sequence**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Receive Goods  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO (3way match)  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case

##  Case 1001  
**No anomaly.**  
The sequence follows the standard P2P flow from requisition  approval  PO  goods  invoice  match  payment  close.

---

##  Case 1002 — Multiple anomalies
**Observed order:**  
Create PR  Issue PO  Invoice received  Payment released  Approve PR  Goods received  Match  Close  

**Issues:**
- **PO issued before PR approval**  bypasses approval control.  
- **Invoice received and payment released before approval and before goods receipt.**  
- **Payment released before invoice matching.**  
  - This violates the 3way match control (PO–GR–Invoice).  
  - High risk of paying for unapproved or undelivered goods.

---

##  Case 1003 — Payment released too early
**Observed order:**  
Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  **Payment released**  Invoice received  Goods received  Match  Close  

**Issues:**
- **Payment made before invoice and goods receipt.**  
  - Strong deviation from P2P controls.  
  - Could indicate prepayment, error, or fraud risk.  
- **Invoice matching happens after payment**, defeating the purpose of the control.

---

##  Case 1004 — Goods received before PO
**Observed order:**  
Create PR  Approve PR  **Receive Goods**  Issue PO  Invoice  Match  Pay  Close  

**Issue:**
- **Goods received before PO issuance.**  
  - Suggests no formal order existed at delivery time.  
  - Could indicate unauthorized purchase or backdated PO.

## Summary of Anomalies
| Case | Anomaly | Why it’s problematic |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| 1002 | PO before approval; payment before approval, goods, and matching | Violates approval and 3way match controls; risk of improper payment |
| 1003 | Payment before invoice and goods | Payment without verification; potential fraud/error |
| 1004 | Goods received before PO | Indicates missing authorization / backdated PO |
