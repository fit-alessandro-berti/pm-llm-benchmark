Sure, I can generate a temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. Here's an example:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Purchase Request', 'Purchase Order'): (1, 0.5),
    ('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receiving Note'): (3, 1),
    ('Goods Receiving Note', 'Invoice'): (5, 2),
    ('Invoice', 'Payment'): (10, 3),
    ('Payment', 'Supplier Confirmation'): (1, 0.5)
}
```

In this example, the average time between 'Purchase Request' and 'Purchase Order' is 1 day with a standard deviation of 0.5 days. The average time between 'Purchase Order' and 'Goods Receiving Note' is 3 days with a standard deviation of 1 day, and so on.

Please note that these are hypothetical values and the actual times may vary based on the specific process and organization.
