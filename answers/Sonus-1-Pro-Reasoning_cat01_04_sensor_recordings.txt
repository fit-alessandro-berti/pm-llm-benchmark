Analysis and Labeling of Manufacturing Activities
To infer the activities being performed on the assembly line, I will analyze the patterns in the sensor readings and group related events together. Each group of events will be assigned a meaningful label based on the observed changes in temperature, pressure, vibration level, material flow rate, tool position, and energy consumption.

Step-by-Step Analysis
Idle/Standby: Events 1-3, 13-15

Temperature: 20-21°C
Pressure: 1 bar
Vibration Level: 0 Hz
Material Flow: 0 units/s
Tool Position: 0 mm
Energy Consumption: 0.40-0.50 kWh
Rationale: These events show minimal activity with low energy consumption and no material flow, indicating that the machine is in an idle or standby state.
Cutting Metal: Events 4-6

Temperature: 50-58°C
Pressure: 1-1.5 bar
Vibration Level: 30-38 Hz
Material Flow: 5 units/s
Tool Position: 5-10 mm
Energy Consumption: 2.00-3.00 kWh
Rationale: The significant increase in temperature, vibration, material flow, and energy consumption suggests a cutting operation. The tool position also moves, indicating active engagement with the material.
Transition/Preparing: Events 7-8

Temperature: 40°C
Pressure: 2 bar
Vibration Level: 10 Hz
Material Flow: 2 units/s
Tool Position: 15 mm
Energy Consumption: 2.00 kWh
Rationale: The drop in temperature and vibration from the cutting phase, with reduced material flow and a different tool position, indicates a preparatory phase for the next activity. This could involve moving the tool or preparing the material for the next step.
Welding: Event 9

Temperature: 80°C
Pressure: 2 bar
Vibration Level: 50 Hz
Material Flow: 0 units/s
Tool Position: 15 mm
Energy Consumption: 5.00 kWh
Rationale: The high temperature and vibration, with no material flow and high energy consumption, are characteristic of a welding operation. Welding often involves high temperatures and vibrations, and the tool position remains stable during the process.
Idle/Standby: Event 10

Temperature: 30°C
Pressure: 1 bar
Vibration Level: 1 Hz
Material Flow: 0 units/s
Tool Position: 15 mm
Energy Consumption: 1.00 kWh
Rationale: This event shows a return to low activity levels, indicating a cooldown or idle state after the high-energy welding operation.
Quality Inspection/Packaging: Events 11-12

Temperature: 25°C
Pressure: 1 bar
Vibration Level: 5 Hz
Material Flow: 1 unit/s
Tool Position: 20 mm
Energy Consumption: 1.50-1.60 kWh
Rationale: The minimal material flow and low energy consumption suggest activities like quality inspection or packaging, where the machine is performing tasks that require less power and material input. The tool position is different from previous activities, indicating a change in the process.
Final Labeled Activities
Idle/Standby: Events 1-3, 13-15

Rationale: Low temperature, pressure, vibration, and energy consumption with no material flow indicate the machine is not performing any active task.
Cutting Metal: Events 4-6

Rationale: Significant increases in temperature, vibration, material flow, and energy consumption suggest a cutting operation where material is being processed.
Transition/Preparing: Events 7-8

Rationale: A drop in temperature and vibration from cutting, with reduced material flow and a different tool position, indicates a preparatory phase for the next activity.
Welding: Event 9

Rationale: High temperature and vibration with no material flow and high energy consumption are characteristic of welding operations.
Idle/Standby: Event 10

Rationale: Return to low activity levels, indicating a cooldown or idle state after the high-energy welding operation.
Quality Inspection/Packaging: Events 11-12

Rationale: Minimal material flow and low energy consumption suggest activities like quality inspection or packaging, where the machine is performing tasks that require less power and material input.
Summary
By analyzing the sensor readings, we have identified and labeled the following activities in the manufacturing process:

Idle/Standby: Events 1-3, 10, 13-15
Cutting Metal: Events 4-6
Transition/Preparing: Events 7-8
Welding: Event 9
Quality Inspection/Packaging: Events 11-12
Each label is based on the observed patterns in the sensor data, which provide insights into the different phases of the manufacturing process.
