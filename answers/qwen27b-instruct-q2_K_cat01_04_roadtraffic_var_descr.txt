The data provided describes various steps involved in issuing fines and collecting payments related to them through a system that has multiple stages of appeals before final payment collection actions.

Let's simplify the process:

Process Steps:
  
  
  
  
  
  `Create Fine`

*

* The initial creation or assignment of penalties (fines).
  

`Send Fine`

*

* Transmitting/facilitating the sending out notices or letters detailing fines to recipients.
  

`Insert Fine Notification`

*

* Notifying the recipient about the fine issuance internally within the system.

`Add Penalty`

*

* Adding financial penalties (additional fees) onto the initial fines as per rules and regulations applicable.

`Payment`
 
*

* The process involving the payment of fines by offenders/individuals responsible for them typically at various stages before final appeal processes.
  
`Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture`

*

* The date when individuals or entities involved can formally request appeals against fines, specifically directed towards prefecture-level authorities.

`Send Appeal to Prefecture`
 
*

* Submitting formal appeal requests concerning fines to the appropriate prefectures for further processing and review.

`Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`

*

* The prefecture receiving official confirmation or outcome of their processed appeals regarding fines received.

`Notify Result Appeal to Offender`

*

* Informing the person responsible for the fine about the resolution of their appeals concerning fines.

`Add penalty`

*

* Adding additional financial penalties following initial fines based on further rule breaches and regulations applicable.

`Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`
 

*

* Prefectures providing outcomes or resolutions regarding submitted appeals over fines received.

`Notify Result Appeal to Offender`

*

* Informing individuals about the final outcome of their appeal processes concerning fines received.


The performance figures indicate the frequency of each stage, often referring to how often these steps are executed for different cases within given time periods. For instance:


- `Send Fine` occurs relatively frequently (`29`, times) suggesting a regular issuance process.

- `Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture` appears less frequently (`9`) indicating there might be fewer appeals submitted compared to the creation of fines.


The overall structure seems designed around handling fines systematically with appeal mechanisms up until final payment collection actions while keeping track internally through these structured processes steps.
