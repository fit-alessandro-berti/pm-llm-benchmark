We are given an event log for customer support tickets. We need to:
 1. Identify cases with significantly longer resolution times.
 2. Determine potential root causes of the delays.
 3. Explain how these factors lead to delays and propose recommendations.

 Steps:
 - First, we will calculate the total resolution time for each case (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket").
 - Then, we can compare the times to identify outliers.

 Let's compute the duration for each case:

 Case 101:
   Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
   End:   2024-03-01 10:15
   Duration: 2 hours and 15 minutes

 Case 102:
   Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
   End:   2024-03-02 09:15
   Duration: 
        From 2024-03-01 08:05 to 2024-03-01 24:00 is 15 hours 55 minutes.
        Then 9 hours 15 minutes on the next day -> total 15h55m + 9h15m = 25 hours 10 minutes.

 Case 103:
   Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
   End:   2024-03-01 09:30
   Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes.

 Case 104:
   Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
   End:   2024-03-02 08:30
   Duration:
        From 2024-03-01 08:20 to 2024-03-01 24:00 is 15 hours 40 minutes.
        Then 8 hours 30 minutes on the next day -> total 15h40m + 8h30m = 24 hours 10 minutes.

 Case 105:
   Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
   End:   2024-03-03 09:30
   Duration:
        Day 1: from 08:25 to 24:00 -> 15 hours 35 minutes.
        Day 2: full day 24 hours.
        Day 3: 9 hours 30 minutes.
        Total: 15h35m + 24h + 9h30m = 49 hours 5 minutes.

 Now, let's list the durations:
  101: 2h15m (135 minutes)
  102: 25h10m (1510 minutes)
  103: 1h20m (80 minutes)
  104: 24h10m (1450 minutes)
  105: 49h5m (2945 minutes)

 We can see that cases 102, 104, and 105 have much longer resolution times.

 We'll break down each of these slow cases to see what happened:

 Case 102:
   Events:
     Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05
     Triage Ticket: 08:30 (25 minutes after receive)
     Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:00 (30 minutes after triage)
     Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 11:30 (2 hours 30 minutes after assign -> long wait for escalation)
     Investigate Issue: 14:00 (2 hours 30 minutes after escalation -> why so long after escalation?)
     Resolve Ticket: next day 09:00 (19 hours after investigation in level-2)
     Close Ticket: 09:15.

   Observations:
     The escalation took a long time (2h30m to assign escalation and then after escalation it took 2h30m until investigation started?).
     But note: the event "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" is at 11:30, then the next event is at 14:00 for investigation. So there is a 2h30m gap after escalation and before investigation.
     Then a long gap from investigation (14:00) to resolution (next day 09:00) which is 19 hours. This might be because the level-2 agent didn't start immediately or the ticket was not picked up until the next day.

 Case 104:
   Events:
     Receive Ticket: 08:20
     Triage Ticket: 09:00 (40 minutes after receive)
     Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:30 (30 minutes after triage)
     Investigate Issue: 13:00 (3 hours 30 minutes after assignment) -> long wait for investigation to start?
     Then resolution next day at 08:00 (19 hours later) and closed at 08:30.

   Observations:
     After assignment (09:30), it took until 13:00 (3h30m) for the agent to start investigation. Why the delay?
     Then after investigation (13:00), the ticket was not resolved until the next day at 08:00 (19 hours later). This might be because the agent didn't work on it until the next day.

 Case 105:
   Events:
     Receive Ticket: 08:25
     Triage Ticket: 08:35 (10 minutes)
     Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:00 (25 minutes)
     Investigate Issue: 09:10 (10 minutes after assignment) -> then what? 
        But then the next event is escalation at 10:00 (50 minutes after investigation started?).
     Then it is escalated to Level-2 Agent at 10:00 on day 1.
     Then the next event is "Investigate Issue" at 14:00 on day 2 (which is more than 24 hours later!).
     Then resolved at 09:00 on day 3 and closed at 09:30.

   Observations:
     After escalation at 10:00 on day 1, there was a huge delay (over 24 hours) until the Level-2 agent started the investigation on day 2 at 14:00.
     Then from investigation at 14:00 on day 2 to resolution at 09:00 on day 3 is 19 hours.

 Potential Root Causes:

  1. Delays in escalation handling: In case 102 and 105, after escalation there was a significant delay before the Level-2 agent started the investigation.

  2. Long waiting time for assignment or investigation: 
      - In case 104, the assignment to Level-1 took 3.5 hours to start investigation after assignment.
      - In case 102, the escalation event occurred at 11:30, but the investigation did not start until 14:00 (same day, 2.5 hours later) and then the resolution was next day (again, 19 hours later). So there were multiple delays.

  3. Overnight delays: In several cases, there are gaps that span the overnight period, which might be due to agents working during business hours only. For example, in case 102, the investigation started at 14:00 and then the next event is the next day at 09:00. This might be because the agent left and didn't work on it until the next day.

  4. Unnecessary delays after investigation start? Or perhaps the issue was complex and took time? But note that in case 101 and 103, we did not have escalations and the entire process was done within the same day. Also, the investigation duration in case 101 was 1 hour (from 09:00 to 10:00) and in 103 was 30 minutes (08:45 to 09:15). However, in case 102, after escalation the investigation took 19 hours (from 14:00 to next day 09:00) and then resolution and closure were quick. Similarly, in case 105, after escalation the investigation took 19 hours (from 14:00 to next day 09:00). 

    But note: the event "Investigate Issue" might be a point in time when the activity started, and then the resolution is the next step. So the time from investigation to resolution should be the active work. However, if the agent is not working continuously, the gap might be due to non-working hours or switching between tickets.

    However, in case 104, after investigation (13:00) the resolution was next day 08:00 (19 hours). And in case 105, after investigation (14:00) the resolution was next day 09:00 (19 hours). This suggests that the agent might have set the ticket aside and not worked on it until the next business day.

  5. Escalation to Level-2 Agent might be a bottleneck: The time between escalation and when the Level-2 agent starts working on it can be very long. In case 105, it took over 24 hours.

 Recommendations:

  1. Monitor and reduce the time between escalation and when the escalated ticket is picked up by the Level-2 team. This might involve setting SLAs for escalation handling or having a dedicated resource for escalated tickets.

  2. For Level-1 agents, ensure that once a ticket is assigned, they start working on it promptly. There might be a need for training or better workload management to avoid long queues.

  3. For overnight delays, consider the possibility of extending support hours or having shift handovers to avoid tickets being left untouched overnight. Alternatively, setting expectations for customers that resolution might take 24-48 hours for complex issues.

  4. Analyze the root cause of escalations to see if there are opportunities for Level-1 agents to resolve more issues without escalation. This could involve additional training or better knowledge bases.

  5. Implement better tracking of the time each ticket spends in each state (e.g., assign, escalate, investigate) to identify systemic delays.

  6. Consider a follow-up process: if a ticket hasn't been updated for a certain period (e.g., 4 hours), an alert could be sent to the assigned agent or the supervisor to check the status.

  7. For the Level-2 team, ensure adequate staffing so that escalated tickets are prioritized and picked up quickly.

  8. If the delay in investigation to resolution is due to waiting for customer response, then set clear timelines for customer responses and have an automated reminder system.

 However, note that the event log does not capture the reason for delays (like waiting for customer input). But since the problem states to consider factors such as escalations, long waiting times between activities, or unnecessary delays, we have identified these.

 Summary of cases with long resolution times:

   Case 102: 25h10m
   Case 104: 24h10m
   Case 105: 49h5m

 The main factors we see are:

   - Escalations leading to long waiting times for Level-2 agents to start work (case 102 and 105).
   - Long gaps between assignment and investigation (case 104).
   - Overnight delays that add a full business day (or more) to the cycle.

 We propose the above recommendations to address these issues.

### Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Times

#### 1. **Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**
- **Case 102**: 25 hours 10 minutes (Resolving Tickets)  
  *Timeline*: Received on March 1 at 08:05  Closed on March 2 at 09:15.  
- **Case 104**: 24 hours 10 minutes  
  *Timeline*: Received on March 1 at 08:20  Closed on March 2 at 08:30.  
- **Case 105**: 49 hours 5 minutes  
  *Timeline*: Received on March 1 at 08:25  Closed on March 3 at 09:30.  

**Comparison with Faster Cases**:  
- **Case 101**: 2 hours 15 minutes (smooth flow with no escalations).  
- **Case 103**: 1 hour 20 minutes (no escalations or delays).  

Cases **102, 104, and 105** are outliers, taking **24–49 hours** versus the average of **<3 hours** for non-escalated cases.

---

#### 2. **Root Causes of Delays**
Three key factors emerge from the event log:  

**A. Escalations Leading to Extended Downtime**  
- **Cases 102 & 105** involved escalations to Level-2 agents, introducing critical delays:  
  - **Case 102**: Escalated at **11:30**  Investigation started **14:00** (2.5-hour gap).  
    *Resolution delayed overnight* (investigation at 14:00 on March 1  resolution at 09:00 on March 2).  
  - **Case 105**: Escalated at **10:00** on March 1  Investigation started **14:00 on March 2** (28-hour gap!).  
    *Investigation then took another 19 hours* (until March 3).  
- **Cause**: Escalated tickets are not prioritized, leaving them in limbo.  

**B. Long Waiting Times Between Key Steps**  
- **Case 104**:  
  - Assigned to Level-1 at **09:30**  Investigation started **13:00** (3.5-hour delay).  
  - Investigation at **13:00**  Resolution **only next day at 08:00** (19-hour gap).  
- **Case 102**:  
  - Escalation at **11:30**  Investigation started **14:00** (2.5-hour delay).  
- **Cause**: Bottlenecks in agent availability or ticket routing.  

**C. Non-Working Hour Gaps**  
- In all delayed cases (**102, 104, 105**), critical steps (e.g., investigation  resolution) spanned overnight hours (e.g., **13:00–09:00 next day**).  
  *Example: Case 105 stalled for 19 hours after investigation on March 2.*  
- **Cause**: Inefficient handovers or lack of 24/7 coverage.  

---

#### 3. **How Factors Increase Cycle Times & Recommendations**  
**Impact of Identified Factors**:  
- **Escalations**: Add **+28 hours** (Case 105) due to unstructured handoffs and low priority for escalated tickets.  
- **Gaps Between Steps**: **+3–19 hours** per gap (e.g., assignment-to-investigation in Case 104).  
- **Overnight Delays**: Standard **19-hour+ gaps** when work spans end-of-day.  

**Proposed Recommendations**:  
1. **Streamline Escalations**:  
   - Assign dedicated Level-2 agents to monitor escalated tickets.  
   - Set **SLA for escalation response** (e.g., investigation must start within 2 hours).  

2. **Optimize Agent Workflows**:  
   - **Reduce gaps**: Implement automated alerts if a ticket isn’t actioned within 1 hour after assignment.  
   - **Balance workloads**: Ensure Level-1 agents are not overburdened (e.g., avoid Case 104’s 3.5-hour delay).  

3. **Minimize Overnight Bottlenecks**:  
   - Add shift overlap (e.g., 15:00–17:00) for handovers.  
   - Use **time-based triggers**: Auto-escalate tickets stuck >12 hours to supervisors.  

4. **Proactive Monitoring**:  
   - Flag tickets nearing **24-hour thresholds** for manual review.  
   - Track "time-in-state" metrics (e.g., time in "escalated" status) to identify chronic bottlenecks.  

**Expected Outcome**:  
- Reducing gaps from **~6–28 hours to <1 hour** could cut resolution times for Cases 102/104 by **~50%**.  
- Prioritizing escalations would prevent delays like Case 105’s 28-hour stall.  

**Conclusion**:  
The primary bottlenecks are **escalation inefficiencies**, **agent workflow gaps**, and **overnight inactivity**. Addressing these via automation, workload balancing, and SLA enforcement will drastically improve resolution times for escalated and complex tickets.
