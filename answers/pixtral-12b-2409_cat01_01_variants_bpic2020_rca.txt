Based on the provided process variants and their performances, the root causes for the performance issues can be attributed to several process-specific considerations:

1. **Rejections and Re-work**:
   - Many of the performance issues stem from declarations being rejected at various stages (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER) and having to go through the process again, leading to increased processing time and cost. For example:
     - "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" with a frequency of 5 and performance of 13,805,869.200.
     - "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR" with a frequency of 6 and performance of 1,482,400.000.
   - Re-work due to rejections increases the overall process time and costs.

2. **Additional Approval Steps**:
   - Variants with additional approval steps tend to have higher performance costs. For instance:
     - "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" adds an extra approval step, resulting in higher performance costs compared to variants without this step.
   - These additional steps increase the process duration and may lead to delays.

3. **Complexity and Variability**:
   - Processes with more stages and variability (due to rejections and additional approvals) tend to have higher performance costs. For example:
     - Variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions have significantly higher performance costs.
     - Variants with simple approval paths (e.g., "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled") generally have lower performance costs.

4. **Path Length**:
   - Longer process paths, which include more steps, tend to have higher performance costs. For instance:
     - Variants with more stages, such as "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" with a frequency of 4 and performance of 3,502,608.250, are more costly than simpler paths.

To improve process performance, consider the following targeted actions:

- **Reduce Rejections**: Implement pre-approval checks or training to minimize declaration rejections.
- **Streamline Approval Processes**: Evaluate if all approval steps are necessary and consider automating or combining approvals where possible.
- **Standardize Process Paths**: Aim for simpler and more consistent process paths to reduce variability and complexity.
- **Monitor and Optimize**: Continuously monitor process performance and identify opportunities for improvement.
