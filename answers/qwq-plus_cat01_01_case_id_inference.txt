Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to group all these events into separate cases without any case ID provided. Hmm, okay. Let me see. First, I'll look for patterns in the events. Each case is a patient journey, right? Each patient's events should form one case.

Looking at the first three events (1, 2, 3), they all are "Register patient" activities with different patient details. Since registration is the start of a patient's journey, maybe each of these is a separate case. Let me note that down: Case 1 starts with Event 1 (Patient Age 45, M, ER), Case 2 with Event 2 (62, F, ER), and Case 3 with Event 3 (28, M, Surgery).

Now Event 4 is "Initial triage" in ER, which would logically follow registration. Let me check the patient details. The patient_age and gender match Event 1 (45M), so that must belong to Case 1. Then Event 5 is another triage for 62F (matching Event 2), so Case 2. The next Event 6 is a surgery consultation for Surgery department, and patient details 28M (matches Event 3), so that's Case 3.

Proceeding to Event 7: X-ray for ER patient 45M, so that's Case 1. Event 8 is Lab test requested in ER for 62F (Case 2), and Event 9 is surgical prep for Case 3 (28M). 

Then Event 10 is Lab test completed for 62F (finish in Case 2?), moving to Event 11, which is a doc consult in ER for 62F (Case 2). Event 12 is a doc consult in ER but for 45M, so back to Case1. Then Event 13 is Surgery performed for Case3 (28M). Event14 is prescription for Case2 (62F). 

Events 15 and 17 are discharges in ER for 45M and 62F, so those close out Cases1 and 2. The last discharge for Surgery (Case3, patient28M is Event18). Wait, but there's Event16 in Recovery for surgery patient, which is between discharge steps, so that should be part of Case3. 

Let me check if each case has a start and end. Case1: Events 1-5, 7, 12, 15? Or does Event12 belong to Case1? Wait Event12 is consultation for 45M in ER. So yes. Then discharge at 15. 

Case2: Events2,5,8,10,11,14,17. 

Case3: 3,6,9,13,16,18. 

Wait let me list all events in each case:

Case1 (45M, ER):

- 1 (Register)
- 4 (Triage)
-7 (X-ray)
-12 (Doc consult)
-15 (Discharge)

Wait, but what about Event 4 comes right after registration? Yes. 

Wait do I miss any? Let's see timestamps. 

Case1 is ER, and the discharge (event15) is last. The events between 1 and 15 should all be his. Let me check indices:

From the list:

Let me go sequentially through each event and assign to cases.

1: Case1

2: Case2

3: Case3

4: Attrib to Case1 (45M ER)

5: Case2

6: Case3

7: ER -45M, so Case1

8: ER 62F - Case2

9: Surgery, 28M - Case3

10: Case2 (62F)

11: ER 62F, so Case2

12: ER 45M, Case1

Then 13: surgery for 28M - Case3

14: lab result for 62F – Case2?

Wait lab test requested in 8 (Case2) by Dr. Smith, then completed in event10, but event14 is Prescription created by Dr. Smith for the same patient? Then yes, that's part of Case2's flow. 

15: Discharge for 45M (Case1)

16: Recovery for surgery patient (28M) – Case3

17: Discharge for 62F – Case2

18: Discharge surgery patient (28M) – Case3

So compiling all:

Case1 (ER, 45M):

1,4,7,12,15

Case2 (ER 62F):

2,5,8,10,11,14,17

Case3 (Surgery 28M):

3,6,9,13,16,18

Let me see if any are overlapping or missed:

- Event 12 is Dr. Smith? Wait in event1, Dr. Smith is only in Event8 (Lab requested) and Event14 (Prescription). Hmm, but in event12, the resource is Dr. Lee, which might be a different doc but same patient.

Yes, the key factors are patient_age and gender matching the initial registration, so the same person. So even if the doc is different, the attributes must align. 

Checking for duplicates: Each registration's attributes are unique (different age/gender/department), so they must each be separate cases. 

Therefore the groupings should be as above.
</think>

**Inferred Case Groupings:**

**Case 1 (Patient 45M - ER Registration):**  
Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
- **Sequence:**  
1. Register  4. Triage  7. X-ray  12. Consultation  15. Discharge  

**Case 2 (Patient 62F - ER Registration):**  
Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
- **Sequence:**  
2. Register  5. Triage  8. Lab Requested  10. Lab Completed  11. Consultation  14. Prescription  17. Discharge  

**Case 3 (Patient 28M - Surgery Registration):**  
Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  
- **Sequence:**  
3. Register (Surgery)  6. Consultation  9. Prep  13. Surgery  16. Recovery  18. Discharge

### **Key Logic:**
1. **Registration Events (1, 2, 3):** 
   - Each unique `Register patient` activity with distinct `patient_age`/`gender`/`department` indicates a new case. 

2. **Patient Attributes:** 
   - Subsequent events are grouped where `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `department` match the original `Register patient` event (e.g., Case 1 = 45M/ER, Case 2 = 62F/ER, Case 3 = 28M/Surgery).  

3. **Temporal and Department Alignment:**  
   - Activities like `Surgery performed` must follow `Surgery preparation` in Case 3. `Patient discharged` closes each case.  
   - Events in the ER for 45M (e.g., `X-ray imaging`) and 62F (e.g., `Lab test`) align with their initial department.  

4. **Workflow Logic:**  
   - `Doctor consultation` in Event 12 (ER, 45M) follows their `X-ray` (Event 7).  
   - Case 2 transitions from `Lab requested` (Event 8) to `Lab completed` (Event 10), then to treatment.  
   - Surgery’s recovery (Case 3, Event 16) precedes discharge (Event 18).  

This grouping ensures patient journeys are logical, self-contained, and align with their departmental context. No overlapping attributes cross cases.
