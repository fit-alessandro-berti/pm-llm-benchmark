Below is an integrated event log in Markdown table form.  

**Assumptions (documented):**  
- Case ID = `order_id`.  
- One event per picked item line (granular picking).  
- One event per delivery dispatch and one per delivery arrival (per `delivery_id`).  
- One event per invoice issued and one per payment.  
- Activity names are inferred from context.  
- Resource = `resource_name` (role in parentheses) where available; for carriers we treat them as resources for dispatch and arrival.  
- All timestamps are used as given; sorting is by timestamp, and when equal (none here) by a stable logical order.
