Proposed high-level process model  
(the same sequence repeats for every CaseID)

1. Material Preparation  
   • Retrieve raw metal sheet  
   • Scan barcode  
   • Place metal sheet on table  

   Rationale – These three events are the first touch-points with a new workpiece, are always executed back-to-back by the same operator and finish when the blank is physically in the workstation and uniquely identified.

2. Positioning & Pre-heat  
   • Align metal sheet (robot)  
   • Preheat metal sheet  

   Rationale – Both actions occur on the fixed sheet before any assembly work starts, are performed by positioning/heating equipment, and share a tight time window (<10 s gap). They transform the sheet into a weld-ready state.

3. Weld Assembly  
   • Pick up welding tool  
   • Weld corner A  
   • Weld corner B  

   Rationale – The welding tool pickup is the setup action that immediately precedes the actual welds. All three events are carried out by the same resource (Operator B) and complete the permanent joining of the part.

4. In-line Weld Inspection  
   • Measure weld integrity  

   Rationale – A single sensor event, but it represents an autonomous quality gate that must succeed before finishing can continue. It is temporally isolated (follows the welds by ~10 s) and uses a different resource class (Quality Sensor).

5. Surface Finishing  
   • Apply protective coating  
   • Dry coating  

   Rationale – Both events are about adding and curing the coating. They always appear together, involve coating/heating units, and prepare the surface for final release.

6. Final Visual Check  
   • Visual check  

   Rationale – Last human confirmation that the product passed all upstream steps; it has no children and closes the case.


Mapping rules (can be automated)

IF Activity matches regex /Retrieve|Scan barcode|Place .* sheet/              “Material Preparation”  
IF Activity == “Align metal sheet” OR “Preheat metal sheet”                 “Positioning & Pre-heat”  
IF Activity starts with “Pick up welding tool” OR “Weld”                    “Weld Assembly”  
IF Activity contains “Measure weld integrity”                               “In-line Weld Inspection”  
IF Activity contains “Apply protective coating” OR “Dry coating”            “Surface Finishing”  
IF Activity == “Visual check”                                               “Final Visual Check”


Example aggregated trace for Case A1 (timestamps of first & last event in each group are shown):

1. Material Preparation              08:00:05 – 08:00:10  
2. Positioning & Pre-heat            08:00:15 – 08:00:20  
3. Weld Assembly                     08:01:00 – 08:01:10  
4. In-line Weld Inspection           08:01:20 – 08:01:20  
5. Surface Finishing                 08:01:30 – 08:01:45  
6. Final Visual Check                08:02:00 – 08:02:00

The same pattern (with slightly shifted times) appears for Case B2 and, according to the brief, for the full event log.
