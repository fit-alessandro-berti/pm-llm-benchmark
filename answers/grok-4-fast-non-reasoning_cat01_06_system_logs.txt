### Transformed Process Mining Event Log

Below is the transformed event log in CSV-like tabular format for easy import into process mining tools (e.g., ProM, Celonis, or Disco). Each row represents a single event. I've included the required attributes (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp) and added two optional derived attributes for richer analysis: **Resource** (the application used) and **Document** (the specific file or window title interacted with, to track objects).

| Case ID | Activity Name          | Timestamp              | Resource         | Document              |

### Explanation of Transformation Logic

**Case Identification:** All events are grouped into a single case (Case ID = 1) to represent a coherent work session focused on preparing a quarterly business report. This is inferred from the temporal sequence and thematic connections: the session starts with Word documents (likely report drafts), moves to email for coordination (e.g., annual meeting details), reviews a related PDF draft, updates a supporting budget spreadsheet, and circles back to refine the documents with cross-references. The entire log spans ~8 minutes without clear breaks or unrelated activities, forming a single narrative of iterative report preparation. If split into multiple cases (e.g., by document), it would fragment the flow; this unified approach yields an analyst-friendly log highlighting task switching in a knowledge work process.

**Activity Naming:** Raw low-level actions (e.g., FOCUS  "Switch to [Context]", TYPING  "Draft Content" or "Update Data" based on Keys attribute, SAVE  "Save Document/Spreadsheet/Report", CLICK/SCROLL/HIGHLIGHT  higher-level steps like "Open Email" or "Review Content") were abstracted into standardized, meaningful process steps. Names emphasize the business purpose (e.g., "Insert Reference" for budget-linked typing) while remaining consistent across similar actions (e.g., all saves are "Save Document" unless context-specific like "Save Report"). Switches are retained as activities to capture workflow transitions, as they reflect multitasking in user processes. This standardization reduces noise and enables discovery of patterns like frequent app switches in process mining analyses.
