**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

* **Case 2:** This case has multiple violations:
    * **Order Violation:** The Risk Assessment was performed *before* the Credit Check, violating the mandatory sequence.
    * **Illegal Action After Rejection:** Finalize Documentation was performed *after* the loan was rejected, which is explicitly disallowed.

**2. Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal Behavior):**

* **Case 3:**
    * **Late Credit Check:** The Credit Check was performed more than 24 hours after the Application Received. While not a strict violation, this is suboptimal.
    * **Delayed Applicant Notification:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision, again, suboptimal.
    * **Missing Follow-up Call:** No Follow-up Call was recorded, another desideratum violation.

* **Case 1 & 2** also both violate the desideratum for quick credit checks, but the lack of a credit check in Case 2 *at all* until too late makes it a hard normative rule failure too, so this is redundant.

**3. Possible Interpretations/Justifications:**

It's important to note that these are just speculations, as we don't have access to the real-world context.

* **Case 2:**  This case seems to suggest a significant process breakdown. It's possible there was a misunderstanding of the process rules, a system error, or even intentional disregard for the procedure. The fact that both ordering *and* the post-rejection documentation were incorrect points towards a larger problem than a simple oversight. This case requires further investigation to understand the root cause.  Perhaps the credit check system was temporarily down, so they tried to assess risk anyway, then ran the credit check when the system came back online, but forgot to re-assess the risk with the new information. Or perhaps the "Finalize Documentation" step has a different meaning in the rejected scenario (e.g., "Finalize Rejection Documentation") but the event log isn't granular enough to capture this nuance.

* **Case 3:** The deviations in this case are more likely to be explained by practical constraints. The delay in the Credit Check could be due to external factors like waiting for information from a third-party credit agency.  The delayed applicant notification might be a result of staff workload or system issues. The missing Follow-up Call could simply be an oversight, or perhaps the applicant was unreachable. While these are not ideal, they are less concerning than the violations in Case 2 and might be addressed through process improvements, e.g. automated reminders for timely follow-up calls and escalation procedures for when external agencies are delaying information.
