### Assumptions:
- Picking events are recorded per item line with exact timestamps, so separate "Item Picked" events are created per item.
- Multi-shipment deliveries produce separate dispatch and arrival events per delivery row.
- Payments are linked to invoices and appear after invoice issuance chronologically.
- For order 1004, no delivery records exist, so no "Order Dispatched" or "Order Arrived" events are logged.
- Resources are resolved from the Resources table, shown as `Name (Role)`.
- Payment resource is unknown (not specified) — left blank.
- For simplicity, event names are descriptive, including partial shipment or invoice info where applicable.
- Order Lines picking dates always occur after order creation date, consistent with process flow.
- Event timestamps are in ISO 8601 UTC format.

If you want, I can also provide this event log as CSV or in any other format for further analysis.
