Hmm, this is a complex supply chain process with multiple activities. The user wants a temporal profile dictionary showing average times and standard deviations between activity pairs, not just direct connections but any eventual following pairs. 

I need to consider realistic timeframes for each step in electronics manufacturing. Supplier selection might take days with high variance due to negotiations. Order placement to receiving components could be weeks with moderate variance depending on shipping. Quality inspection might be quick but with some variance due to potential issues. Assembly and testing could take days with moderate variance. Packaging and storage might be faster with low variance. Distribution could take days with high variance due to logistics. After-sales support would have the longest timeframe with high variance since it happens after sale.

I should include pairs that are not adjacent to show the model understands eventual following, like SS to RC or OP to PT. The standard deviations should generally be smaller than the averages but still significant to reflect real-world variability. 

Let me structure this with the most critical pairs first, covering the main flow from supplier selection to after-sales support, while including some non-adjacent pairs for complexity. The times should be in seconds as specified.

Given the complexity of the global supply chain process for high-tech electronics, here is a temporal profile dictionary capturing estimated average times and standard deviations (in seconds) for pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in the process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Supplier engagement and procurement phase
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 86400),    # Avg: 2 days, Std: 1 day (negotiation variability)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (2592000, 864000),  # Avg: 30 days, Std: 10 days (supplier lead time variance)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (2419200, 604800),  # Avg: 28 days, Std: 7 days (shipping and production delays)
    
    # Quality assurance phase
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),     # Avg: 1 day, Std: 6 hours (inspection scheduling)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 14400),     # Avg: 12 hours, Std: 4 hours (quality clearance)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (129600, 43200),    # Avg: 1.5 days, Std: 12 hours (combined steps)
    
    # Manufacturing phase
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 28800),     # Avg: 1 day, Std: 8 hours (assembly complexity)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (21600, 7200),      # Avg: 6 hours, Std: 2 hours (testing thoroughness)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (108000, 36000),    # Avg: 1.25 days, Std: 10 hours (combined processing)
    
    # Distribution preparation
    ('PK', 'WS'): (28800, 7200),      # Avg: 8 hours, Std: 2 hours (packaging to storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),     # Avg: 1 day, Std: 12 hours (storage duration variability)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (115200, 43200),    # Avg: 1.33 days, Std: 12 hours (combined steps)
    
    # End-to-end pairs
    ('SS', 'DT'): (5184000, 864000),  # Avg: 60 days, Std: 10 days (full process variability)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (2505600, 604800),  # Avg: 29 days, Std: 7 days (procurement to testing)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (2160000, 432000),  # Avg: 25 days, Std: 5 days (receiving to distribution)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (2073600, 432000),  # Avg: 24 days, Std: 5 days (inspection to distribution)
    
    # After-sales relationships
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000),  # Avg: 30 days, Std: 10 days (distribution to support activation)
    ('SS', 'AS'): (7776000, 1728000), # Avg: 90 days, Std: 20 days (full lifecycle)
    ('PT', 'AS'): (2678400, 864000),  # Avg: 31 days, Std: 10 days (testing to support)
}
```

**Note**: This profile includes:
1. Directly consecutive pairs (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`)
2. Indirect but logically connected pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')`)
3. End-to-end relationships (e.g., `('SS', 'DT')`)
4. Post-sale connections (e.g., `('DT', 'AS')`)

The values reflect realistic supply chain timelines where:
- Procurement phases have the highest variability
- Physical processing steps (CA, PT, PK) have moderate variability
- Logistics steps (WS, DT) show medium variability
- After-sales support has high temporal uncertainty
- Standard deviations are proportional to the complexity and external dependencies of each transition
