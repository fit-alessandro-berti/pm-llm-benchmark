Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task. The goal is to rename activities in the event log so that each occurrence's context is clear, especially when the same activity name is used multiple times in a case. 

Looking at the event log provided, the activities that repeat within the same case are "Verify Documents", "Call Customer", and "Adjust Account". Let me check each case to see how their meanings differ.

Starting with Case C001:
- The first "Verify Documents" happens right after initiating the request, with the context that the agent checks identity docs. Then later, after the customer submits additional docs, there's another "Verify Documents" where the agent re-checks because the ID scan is now provided. So the second one is a re-verification after additional info. So maybe the first is Initial Document Verification and the second is Re-Verify Documents Post-Submission?

Then "Call Customer" in C001 occurs when the verification was incomplete and they needed missing docs. The context says "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs." So that's a call to request missing documents. Then in C002, the first "Call Customer" is an outbound call to clarify an account discrepancy. The second call in C002 is a follow-up to confirm adjustments. Hmm, so in C003, the call is because the customer stepped out, so the officer calls to have them return. So the "Call Customer" activity has different contexts each time. Need to differentiate those.

"Adjust Account" in C002 is after adjusting account details after a call. In C003, it's an internal correction due to missing info. So maybe the first is Adjust Account Post-Discrepancy and the second is Adjust Account Due to Missing Info? Or perhaps more precise terms.

Let me list all recurring activities across all cases:

1. Initiate Request: This is only once per case, so probably doesn't need renaming. Same with Approve Request.

2. Verify Documents occurs in all three cases. Let's check each occurrence:

- C001 first: Agent checks identity docs (initial check)
- C001 second: After submission, re-check because ID scan is there now. So re-verification after additional docs.

- C002 first: "Identity verification" – maybe that's the initial check here. The second occurrence? Wait, C002 only has one Verify Documents? Wait looking back:

Wait C002's events: Initiate, Verify, Call, Adjust, another Call, Approve. So only one Verify Documents in C002. Wait no, let me check again:

Wait the C002 row for Verify Documents is only once. So C001 has two, C003 has two. So the problem is in C001 and C003. So for those two cases where Verify Documents occurs twice, need to differentiate.

Similarly, "Call Customer" occurs three times across cases. Let's see:

C001: first call is to request missing docs.

C002 first call: outbound to clarify account discrepancy.

C002 second call: follow-up to confirm adjustments.

C003's call is because customer stepped out, so officer calls to have them return.

So each of these calls has different contexts. So each occurrence of "Call Customer" might need a different name based on the context.

"Adjust Account" occurs in C002 and C003. In C002, it's after adjusting account details after a call. The context says "adjust account details internally after call." In C003, it's "internal correction due to missing info." So perhaps different reasons here.

So the plan is to rename the activities that repeat in the same case, and also those that have different contexts across cases but in the same case? Wait the problem says "within the same case". So the main focus is on activities that occur multiple times in the same case. Let me check each case:

Case C001 has two "Verify Documents" and one "Call Customer". So those two need renaming in C001.

Case C002 has one "Call Customer" twice. Wait, in C002, there are two "Call Customer" entries. The first is at 09:00, the second at 09:50. So in the same case, two calls. So those need to be differentiated.

Case C003 has two "Verify Documents" and one "Call Customer". The two Verify Documents here: first after walk-in, then after adjustment. The call here is once, but different context than others.

So the recurring activities within the same case are:

- C001: Verify Documents (twice), Call Customer (once but maybe not duplicated here, but in C002 it's duplicated)

Wait in C001, the "Call Customer" occurs once. The duplication in Call Customer is in C002 (two calls) and C003 has one. So the activities that are duplicated in the same case are:

C001: Verify Documents (twice)

C002: Call Customer (twice)

C003: Verify Documents (twice)

Therefore, those are the ones that need renaming. The other instances (like Adjust Account in two different cases but only once per case) don't need renaming unless their context in their own case is ambiguous, but since they only occur once per case, maybe they are okay. But the problem says "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case" so only those that are duplicated in the same case need renaming.

So first, for each of those duplicated activities in the same case, we need to rename them to reflect their context.

Starting with C001's two Verify Documents:

First occurrence in C001: Timestamp 09:20, context is "Agent checks identity documents." Since this is right after the initial request, it's the initial verification. The second occurrence is at 10:30, after the customer submitted additional docs. The context says "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided." So the second is a re-verification after additional info. So possible names:

First: "Initial Document Verification"

Second: "Re-Verify Documents Post-Additional Submission"

Alternatively, maybe "Initial Identity Verification" and "Re-Verify Documents After ID Scan" ?

Hmm, perhaps more concise. Maybe "Initial Document Check" and "Re-Verification of Documents After Submission".

For the Call Customer in C002 (two instances):

First call in C002: context is "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy." So that's a call to address a discrepancy.

Second call in C002: "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made." So after adjusting the account, they follow up to confirm.

So names could be "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy" and "Follow-Up Confirmation Call".

In C003's two Verify Documents:

First occurrence: after walk-in, the context is "Physical verification of ID." The second is after the account adjustment: "Re-verify docs after account adjustment." So first is Physical ID Check, second is Re-Verify Post-Adjustment.

Wait the first in C003 is "Physical verification of ID" by BranchOfficer. The second is "Re-verify docs after account adjustment." So maybe "Physical ID Verification" and "Re-Verify Documents Post-Account Adjustment".

Now for the Adjust Account in C002 and C003. Since they are in different cases but only once each, maybe they don't need renaming unless their context is ambiguous. But the problem says to focus on same-case duplicates. So Adjust Account occurs once in each case, so no need to rename unless their own context in their case is ambiguous. Let's see:

In C002, Adjust Account is "Adjust account details internally after call." The reason is after a call to clarify a discrepancy, so maybe "Adjust Account Post-Discrepancy Resolution"?

In C003, it's "Internal correction due to missing info." So "Adjust Account Due to Missing Information". But since they are in separate cases, maybe they can stay as Adjust Account unless there's a case where the same activity is duplicated. Since they are not duplicated in the same case, perhaps they don't need renaming. The problem might not require those unless they are duplicated in the same case. So maybe focus only on the ones that are duplicated in the same case.

Now, let's process each case's duplicates:

Case C001:

Activities to rename:

1. Verify Documents (first instance): Initial Document Verification (since it's the first check after initiation)

Second instance: Re-Verify Documents After Additional Submission (since after the customer submitted the ID scan)

Call Customer in C001: The context here is "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs." So the call is to request missing documents. So maybe "Call to Request Missing Documents".

Wait but in C001, the Call Customer is only once, so no duplication here, so that's okay. Only the two Verifies need renaming here.

Case C002:

Call Customer occurs twice. First call: "Outbound to clarify account discrepancy"  "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy"

Second call: "Follow-up to confirm adjustments"  "Follow-Up Confirmation Call"

Case C003:

Verify Documents occurs twice. First: "Physical verification of ID"  "Physical ID Verification"

Second: "Re-verify after account adjustment"  "Re-Verify Documents Post-Account Adjustment"

Additionally, the "Call Customer" in C003 is once, so no duplication there. So that's okay.

Now, let's check other activities. The "Initiate Request" is the same each time, so no need. "Approve Request" is same. "Submit Additional" is only once per case. "Adjust Account" in C002 and C003 are unique in their cases, so maybe they can stay as is unless their context in their own case could be ambiguous. For example, in C002, the Adjust Account is after a call to clarify a discrepancy, so maybe "Adjust Account Post-Discrepancy" could be a better name, but since it's only once, perhaps it's okay. The problem might not require that unless the same activity is duplicated in the same case. Since they are not, maybe leave them as is.

Now, let's go through each row and rename the activities accordingly.

Starting with C001:

Original rows for C001:

1. Initiate Request  stays

2. Verify Documents  Rename to "Initial Document Verification"

3. Call Customer  "Call to Request Missing Documents"

4. Submit Additional  stays

5. Verify Documents  "Re-Verify Documents Post-Additional Submission"

6. Approve  stays

C002:

First Call Customer  "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy"

Second Call Customer  "Follow-Up Confirmation Call"

The other activities in C002 can stay as is except the two calls.

C003:

First Verify Documents  "Physical ID Verification"

Second Verify Documents  "Re-Verify Documents Post-Account Adjustment"

The Call Customer in C003 is "Call Customer" with context "Customer stepped out...", so maybe that's unique. Since it's only once, perhaps rename it to "Call to Prompt Customer Return" or "Follow-Up Call for Return"? Wait, but the problem says to rename only the activities that are duplicated in the same case. Since in C003, the Call Customer is only once, so it doesn't need renaming. However, the original name "Call Customer" might be ambiguous in other cases, but since the problem focuses on same-case duplicates, maybe it's okay. Alternatively, maybe the user expects all instances of "Call Customer" to be renamed based on context even if not duplicated in the same case. Wait the problem says "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case" so the task is to handle those. So only the ones that are duplicated in the same case need renaming. The other instances can stay as "Call Customer" unless their context is ambiguous in their own case. For example, in C003, the call is to have the customer return, so maybe that's a different context than others, but since it's not duplicated in the case, perhaps it's okay to leave as is. But maybe the problem expects that even if an activity occurs once but in different contexts across cases, but the problem's instruction is to focus on same-case duplicates. Hmm, the problem says "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case" so the task is to rename those. So the other instances (like the first Call in C002, which is not duplicated in the case but occurs in another case) can stay as "Call Customer" unless their own context requires it. Wait no, the problem says "their names clearly reflect their contextual differences" even if they are in different cases. Wait the first paragraph says "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case, but carry different contextual meanings depending on when and how they occur." So the main issue is within the same case. Therefore, only the activities that are duplicated in the same case need to be renamed. The other instances (like the first Call in C002, which is not duplicated in that case) can remain as "Call Customer" unless their own context in their case is ambiguous. But since they only occur once in their case, their name doesn't need to change. However, perhaps the problem expects that even across cases, if the same activity name is used but with different contexts, they should be renamed. Wait the problem says "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case" so the focus is on same-case duplicates. So the answer should only rename those that are duplicated in the same case.

Therefore, proceeding with that.

Now, let's re-express each row with the new names.

Starting with C001:

Original rows for C001:

Row 2 (Verify Documents first time): becomes "Initial Document Verification"

Row 3 (Call Customer): "Call to Request Missing Documents"

Row 5 (Verify Documents second time): "Re-Verify Documents Post-Additional Submission"

Other rows remain as is except the renamed ones.

C002:

Row 3 (first Call Customer): "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy"

Row 5 (second Call Customer): "Follow-Up Confirmation Call"

C003:

Row 3 (Verify Documents first): "Physical ID Verification"

Row 5 (Verify Documents second): "Re-Verify Documents Post-Account Adjustment"

Now, let's check the other activities. For example, in C003's Call Customer (row 4?), let me check the original C003's rows:

C003's events:

1. Initiate Request

2. Verify Documents  becomes Physical ID Verification

3. Call Customer  context: customer stepped out, so officer calls to have them return. Since this is the only Call in this case, it can stay as "Call Customer" unless we need to make it more specific. But since it's not duplicated in the case, maybe leave as is. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that even if it's a single instance but with a unique context, but the problem's instruction is to focus on duplicates. So perhaps leave it as "Call Customer".

Wait the problem says "rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences". So even if an activity occurs once but in a context that's different from other instances of the same activity name in other cases, perhaps they should be renamed. Hmm, the problem's first instruction is to "identify activities that appear multiple times within the same case" so the renaming is required for those. For activities that are not duplicated in the same case but have different contexts across cases, maybe they don't need renaming unless the name is ambiguous. For example, "Call Customer" in C001 is to request missing docs, in C002 first is to clarify discrepancy, second to confirm, and in C003 to get the customer back. All these are different contexts but since they are not in the same case, perhaps the original name is okay. The problem might not require renaming those unless they are in the same case. So proceed with the initial plan.

Now, compiling the revised log:

For C001:

Original rows:

| C001 | Initiate Request | ... | ... | ... |

Then:

Second row (Verify Documents) becomes "Initial Document Verification"

Third row (Call Customer) becomes "Call to Request Missing Documents"

Fifth row (Verify Documents again) becomes "Re-Verify Documents Post-Additional Submission"

The rest stay the same.

Similarly for other cases.

Now, let's write out the revised table.

Starting with C001:

Case C001:

Row 1: Initiate Request (unchanged)

Row2: Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification

Row3: Call Customer  Call to Request Missing Documents

Row4: Submit Additional (unchanged)

Row5: Verify Documents  Re-Verify Documents Post-Additional Submission

Row6: Approve (unchanged)

C002:

Row1: Initiate Request

Row2: Verify Documents (unchanged, since only once here)

Row3: Call Customer  Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy

Row4: Adjust Account (unchanged)

Row5: Call Customer  Follow-Up Confirmation Call

Row6: Approve

C003:

Row1: Initiate Request

Row2: Verify Documents  Physical ID Verification

Row3: Call Customer (unchanged, since only once here)

Row4: Adjust Account (unchanged)

Row5: Verify Documents  Re-Verify Documents Post-Account Adjustment

Row6: Approve

Now, let's check the additional contexts to ensure the names capture the clues.

For example, in C001's second Verify Documents, the context mentions "now that ID scan is provided", so the name should reflect that it's after submission. The name "Re-Verify Documents Post-Additional Submission" captures that.

In C003's second Verify, after the account adjustment, so "Post-Account Adjustment" makes sense.

The calls in C002's first call is about a discrepancy, so "Clarify Account Discrepancy" is good. The second is follow-up after adjustment, so "Follow-Up Confirmation" is okay.

Now, the justification for each renaming:

For "Initial Document Verification" vs "Re-Verify... in C001: The first is the initial check right after initiation, the second after additional docs are submitted.

Call to Request Missing Documents in C001: The context states the verification was incomplete, so the call is to request missing docs.

In C002's calls: first is to clarify a discrepancy, second to confirm adjustments. Hence the names.

Physical ID Verification in C003's first verify because it's a physical check at the branch. The second is after an account adjustment, so the re-verify is post that.

Adjust Account in C002 and C003: Since they are not duplicated in their own cases, they remain as is, but their contexts are handled by their descriptions. However, maybe the problem expects that even these could be renamed if their contexts differ across cases. Wait the problem says to rename activities that are duplicated in the same case. Since Adjust Account occurs once in each case, they don't need renaming. So that's okay.

Now, compiling the revised table with the new activity names.

Let me structure the answer as per the instructions:

First, present the revised log with renamed activities.

Then, the justification.

Let me make sure all the renamed activities are correctly placed.

Revised Event Log:

Case C001:

| C001 | Initiate Request | ... | ... | ... |

| C001 | Initial Document Verification | ... | ... | Agent checks identity documents. |

| C001 | Call to Request Missing Documents | ... | ... | Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs. |

| C001 | Submit Additional | ... | ... | 

| C001 | Re-Verify Documents Post-Additional Submission | ... | Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided. |

| C001 | Approve Request | ... | 

C002:

| C002 | Initiate Request | ... |

| C002 | Verify Documents | ... | Identity verification. |

| C002 | Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy | ... | Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy. |

| C002 | Adjust Account | ... | Adjust account details internally after call. |

| C002 | Follow-Up Confirmation Call | ... | Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made. |

| C002 | Approve Request | ... |

C003:

| C003 | Initiate Request | ... | Walk-in customer at branch. |

| C003 | Physical ID Verification | ... | Physical verification of ID. |

| C003 | Call Customer | ... | Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return. |

| C003 | Adjust Account | ... | Internal correction due to missing info. |

| C003 | Re-Verify Documents Post-Account Adjustment | ... | Re-verify docs after account adjustment. |

| C003 | Approve Request | ... |

Wait, in C003's second Verify Documents, the context is "Re-verify docs after account adjustment." So the name is correct.

Now the justification:

Justification:

1. **Verify Documents in C001 and C003**:
   - **C001 First Occurrence**: Renamed to "Initial Document Verification" as it occurs right after request initiation, indicating the first check of identity documents.
   - **C001 Second Occurrence**: "Re-Verify Documents Post-Additional Submission" reflects the recheck after the customer provided additional ID, as per the context mentioning the ID scan was now available.
   - **C003 First Occurrence**: "Physical ID Verification" specifies the method (physical) and type (ID) of the check at the branch.
   - **C003 Second Occurrence**: "Re-Verify Documents Post-Account Adjustment" denotes the recheck following an account adjustment, ensuring docs align with updated info.

2. **Call Customer in C001 and C002**:
   - **C001**: "Call to Request Missing Documents" directly addresses the context of following an incomplete verification needing more documents.
   - **C002 First Call**: "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy" aligns with the outbound call to resolve a discrepancy noted in the account.
   - **C002 Second Call**: "Follow-Up Confirmation Call" matches the purpose of confirming the adjustments made post-account change.

3. **Other Activities**:
   - "Adjust Account" in C002 and C003 retains its name as it occurs once per case, but their contexts are clarified through the Additional Context column. For example, C002's adjustment is post-discrepancy resolution, while C003's addresses missing info.

This should cover the required changes. Now, putting it all together in the answer.

**Justification for Naming Choices:**

1. **Verify Documents Renamings**:
   - **C001 First**: "Initial Document Verification" reflects its role as the first check after request initiation.  
   - **C001 Second**: "Re-Verify Documents Post-Submission" highlights the recheck after additional documents (ID scan) were provided.  
   - **C003 First**: "Physical ID Verification" specifies the method (physical) and document type (ID) for clarity.  
   - **C003 Second**: "Re-Verify Documents Post-Adjustment" ties the recheck to the preceding account adjustment, ensuring context.

2. **Call Customer Renamings**:
   - **C001**: "Call to Request Missing Documents" directly ties the call to resolving incomplete verification.  
   - **C002 First**: "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy" aligns with the context of addressing a discrepancy.  
   - **C002 Second**: "Follow-Up Confirmation Call" emphasizes post-adjustment verification, distinguishing it from the initial call.  

3. **Non-Renamed Activities**:
   - **Adjust Account**: Retained in cases where it occurs once (C002/C003) since duplication doesn’t occur within a single case. Contextual details in "Additional Context" (e.g., "post-discrepancy" or "missing info") disambiguate its purpose without renaming.  

This approach ensures each activity’s name reflects its temporal and contextual role within the workflow, eliminating ambiguity for process analysis.
