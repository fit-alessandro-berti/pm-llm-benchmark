### Analysis of the Two POWL Models

#### **Standard Hire-to-Retire Process**
The normative process typically follows a sequence:
1. Post a job advertisement.
2. Screen candidates.
3. Conduct interviews.
4. Make a hiring decision.
5. Onboard the employee.
6. Add the employee to the payroll system.
7. Close the case.

The process is expected to flow linearly with minimal deviations. Loops or choices may occur (e.g., re-interviewing candidates or skipping onboarding steps in rare scenarios), but these should be exceptions, not the norm.

### **Analysis of POWL Model 1**

#### **Structure**
1. Activities:
   - Standard activities are present (`Post_Job_Ad`, `Screen_Candidates`, etc.).
2. Order:
   - `Post_Job_Ad → Screen_Candidates` is enforced.
   - `Screen_Candidates → Conduct_Interviews` and `Screen_Candidates → Make_Hiring_Decision` are parallel.
   - The decision to onboard follows directly from `Make_Hiring_Decision`.
   - The payroll addition and case closure follow sequentially after onboarding.

#### **Anomalies**
1. **Parallel Screening and Interviewing:**
   - Both `Conduct_Interviews` and `Make_Hiring_Decision` occur after `Screen_Candidates` but are modeled in parallel.
   - Anomalous because interviews should generally follow screening to ensure only qualified candidates are interviewed.
   - This could result in unnecessary resource use or interviewing unqualified candidates.
   
2. **Missing Control Over Decision and Onboarding:**
   - The model assumes every decision results in onboarding, without allowing for rejecting candidates. This ignores the possibility of disqualifying all candidates and repeating the hiring cycle.

#### **Severity of Anomalies**
- **Moderate Severity:** While the process is mostly linear, the assumption of parallel interviews and missing rejection logic compromises the practical and logical flow of the process.

### **Analysis of POWL Model 2**

#### **Structure**
1. Activities:
   - Includes all standard activities plus a silent transition (`skip`) for loop and XOR conditions.
2. Order:
   - `Post_Job_Ad → Screen_Candidates` and `Post_Job_Ad → Conduct_Interviews` are in parallel.
   - `Conduct_Interviews → Make_Hiring_Decision`.
   - `Make_Hiring_Decision → loop_onboarding`, where onboarding can loop or skip.
   - Payroll addition (`xor_payroll`) is optional via XOR with the `skip` transition.
   - The case is closed after either payroll or skip.

#### **Anomalies**
1. **Parallel Posting and Screening/Interviewing:**
   - Similar to Model 1, this model assumes `Post_Job_Ad` occurs in parallel with both `Screen_Candidates` and `Conduct_Interviews`.
   - Unrealistic since candidates cannot be screened or interviewed before the job ad is posted and responses are received.

2. **Loop on Onboarding:**
   - The `loop_onboarding` structure implies multiple onboarding attempts for the same employee, which is illogical. Onboarding is typically a one-time process.

3. **Payroll XOR Logic:**
   - The XOR allows skipping the `Add_to_Payroll` step entirely, which is a critical part of the Hire-to-Retire process. Skipping payroll registration is a severe anomaly as it violates the essence of the workflow.

#### **Severity of Anomalies**
- **High Severity:** Skipping payroll registration undermines the integrity of the process. Additionally, parallel posting and screening/interviewing create a misaligned sequence. The onboarding loop further complicates the process without adding practical value.

### **Comparison of Models**

#### **Alignment with Normative Process**
- **Model 1:**
  - While it introduces some illogical parallel activities and lacks rejection logic, its overall structure more closely follows the normative sequence.
  - All essential steps (job posting, screening, interviewing, decision-making, onboarding, payroll, and closure) are included and executed at least once in a plausible sequence.

- **Model 2:**
  - The XOR condition that allows skipping payroll registration fundamentally violates the normative process.
  - Additional anomalies (e.g., parallel posting and onboarding loops) exacerbate misalignment with real-world processes.

#### **Conclusion**
Model 1 aligns more closely with the normative Hire-to-Retire process. Its anomalies, while significant, are less severe than those in Model 2. Model 2 introduces deviations that undermine the logical integrity and completeness of the workflow.
