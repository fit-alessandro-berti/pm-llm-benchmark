Here’s one possible redesign—layered around three big levers (automation, predictive routing, dynamic resource allocation) but still recognizable as your original process.

1. Intake & Predictive Routing  
  • Task A (Receive Customer Request) becomes a lightweight API or webform that immediately fires two things in parallel:  
    – an event to an “AI Scoring” microservice  
    – an event to the RPA validation engine (see Standard path below)  
  • New Task A1 “AI Complexity Scoring”  
     – Predicts (from past data) the probability that this request will need customization, its estimated revenue, risk, SLA target, etc.  
  • New Gateway “HighComplexity?” (Threshold on the score)  
     – If above threshold, route to Customoriented subsystem  
     – Otherwise treat as Standard  

2. Fully Automated Standard Path  
  • B1 “Perform Standard Validation” becomes a ruleengine check  
     – Invalid requests get an immediate “autoreject” or “clarification required” message back to customer via RPA bot  
  • Replace the manual ANDgate “Run Parallel Checks” with eventdriven calls to:  
     – C1 “Credit Check Service” (instant call to credit API)  
     – C2 “Inventory Check Service” (realtime stock service)  
  • New Subprocess “Predictive Inventory Allocation” (optional)  
     – If C2 sees low stock, automatically reserve inventory or trigger a reorder workflow  
  • Join and immediately invoke D “Calculate Delivery Date” as a serverless function  

3. SelfService & CPQDriven Custom Path  
  • B2 “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis” becomes a twostep subprocess:  
     1. “Customer SelfConfigurator” (web tool asks key questions, narrows scope)  
     2. “AutoFeasibility Rule Engine” (80% of simple customs solved automatically)  
  • Gateway “Is Customization Feasible?”  
     – If No  E2 “Send Rejection Notice” (automated, with suggestions for offtheshelf alternatives)  
     – If Yes  E1 “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
         • Hand off to a modern ConfigurePriceQuote (CPQ) tool that pulls cost data, approves margins, builds draft quote  

4. Dynamic Resource & Approval Allocation  
  • After D or E1, new Task “Resource Assignment & SLA Check”  
     – A workforcemanagement service allocates the next available agent/engineer/manager based on:  
         • realtime workload  
         • required skill set  
         • SLA commitment from A1  
  • New Gateway “AutoApprove?” (rulebased, e.g. orders <$5k or margin >30% get autoapproved)  
     – If Yes  skip to G “Generate Final Invoice”  
     – If No  F “Obtain Manager Approval”  
         • Routed to whoever has capacity, with digital reminders and mobile approvals  
  • Gateway “Is Approval Granted?”  
     – If Yes  G “Generate Final Invoice”  
     – If No  H “ReEvaluate Conditions”  
         • Automatically suggest alternative terms (extend leadtime, adjust specs) via a recommender engine  
         • Loop back into E1 or D with updated parameters  

5. Finalization & Continuous Feedback  
  • G “Generate Final Invoice” is fully automated by ERP integration  
  • I “Send Confirmation to Customer” is sent by the same notification service that …  
     – Updates the customer portal in real time  
     – Pushes status into a postsale “Customer Engagement” dashboard  
  • New Subprocess “Analytics & Continuous Improvement”  
     – Logs every step into a data lake  
     – Retrains the “AI Complexity Scoring” model weekly  
     – Monitors SLAs, bottlenecks, bouncebacks and surfaces dashboards for the ops team  

Impact Summary  
  • Turnaround Time   
     – Manual validations and parallel checks are now subsecond API calls  
     – Autoapproval thresholds remove up to ~50% of manager interventions  
  • Flexibility   
     – Selfservice CPQ handles many custom quotes without human touch  
     – Dynamic resource routing smooths workload spikes  
  • Predictiveness   
     – Early scoring directs higheffort cases into the right “fasttrack” lanes  
     – Recommender engines suggest remedial actions automatically on rejection  
  • Customer Satisfaction   
     – Faster, more transparent status updates via portal and notifications  
     – Meaningful alternatives offered automatically when requests can’t be met  
  • Operational Complexity   
     – You need to maintain rule engines, ML models, CPQ integrations and RPA scripts  
     – Requires decent datagovernance and DevOps practices to keep all automation in sync  

Overall, you trade a higher technology footprint and initial setup cost for dramatic reductions in cycle time, far fewer manual handoffs, and a system that “learns” and selfoptimizes over time.
