To address the given task, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Identify cases with the specific sequence of activities** ('Approve Purchase Requisition' → 'Create Order' → 'Confirm Order') in direct succession.
2. **Check the time elapsed** between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' to ensure it exceeds 5 days.
3. **Exclude these cases** from the final result and return all other events from the `event_log`.

### SQL Query

```sql
WITH sequence_cases AS (
    -- Identify cases that contain the specific sequence of activities
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
    ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
),
sequence_with_time_condition AS (
    -- Join events and filter the cases based on the time condition between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'
    SELECT el1.case_id
    FROM event_log el1
    JOIN event_log el2
        ON el1.case_id = el2.case_id
        AND el1.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND el2.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    WHERE el2.timestamp > el1.timestamp
      AND DATEDIFF(el2.timestamp, el1.timestamp) > 5
),
final_result AS (
    -- Select cases that do not match the above sequence and time condition
    SELECT case_id
    FROM sequence_cases
    WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_with_time_condition)
)

-- Return all events except those belonging to filtered cases
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM final_result)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **sequence_cases**: 
   - This common table expression (CTE) selects all cases (`case_id`) where any of the three activities ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', or 'Confirm Order') occur. The events are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to ensure we can check the sequence properly.
   
2. **sequence_with_time_condition**: 
   - This CTE checks for the specific sequence where 'Create Order' happens before 'Confirm Order' and calculates the difference in days. Only cases where the difference exceeds 5 days are selected.
   
3. **final_result**: 
   - This CTE retrieves all the `case_id`s from `sequence_cases` that do not match the sequence with the time condition (cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days).
   
4. **Final SELECT**: 
   - The main query selects all rows from `event_log` except those from the cases identified in `final_result`.

This query ensures that only the events from cases that don't match the specific sequence and timing condition are returned. It provides a correct filter to exclude the specified cases.
