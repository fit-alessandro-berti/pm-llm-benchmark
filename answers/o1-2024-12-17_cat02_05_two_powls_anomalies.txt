Below is a detailed analysis of both POWL models, highlighting the typical logic of a Hire-to-Retire process, identifying the anomalies, and determining which model aligns more closely with a normative version of this process.

### Understanding the Normative Hire-to-Retire Process

A standard “Hire-to-Retire” process is generally expected to follow a logical and sequential path. While the exact details can vary, a common flow is:

1. **Post Job Ad**: Advertise the open position.
2. **Screen Candidates**: Review applications to shortlist suitable candidates.
3. **Conduct Interviews**: Interview the shortlisted candidates.
4. **Make Hiring Decision**: Decide whether to hire a candidate (or in some cases, multiple candidates).
    - If the decision is positive (hire):
        - **Onboard Employee**: Integrate the new hire into the organization, providing necessary resources and orientation.
        - **Add to Payroll**: Set up the new employee in the payroll system.
    - If the decision is negative (no hire):
        - **Close Case**: End the process without hiring.
5. **Close Case**: Final administrative closure once hiring or non-hiring actions are completed.

Key logical requirements in a normative scenario include:  
- Screening should happen before interviewing.  
- Interviews should precede the hiring decision.  
- The hiring decision should branch the process: a positive decision leads to onboarding and payroll; a negative decision leads directly to closure.  
- Once an employee is hired, onboarding and payroll setup should not be optional; they should occur in sequence before the case is closed.

### Analysis of POWL Model 1

**Model Structure:**
```  
Post -> Screen -> Decide -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close
             \-> Interview
```

**Key Observations:**

1. **Concurrent or Unordered Interview and Decision Steps**:  
   After screening, the model has two outgoing edges: one leads to “Make_Hiring_Decision” and the other to “Conduct_Interviews.” There is no defined order between “Interview” and “Decide.” This implies that the hiring decision could be made before or even without conducting interviews, or that interviews could occur in parallel or even after the decision.  
   
   *Anomaly:* A normative process requires interviews to precede and inform the hiring decision. Allowing decisions without completed interviews is a significant logical anomaly.

2. **No Distinction Between Positive and Negative Hiring Decisions**:  
   After “Make_Hiring_Decision,” the process always proceeds to onboarding and then payroll. This implies that any hiring decision leads automatically to onboarding, with no path for a negative decision. A typical process would have a branching structure: if the candidate is not hired, the process should go directly to closure rather than onboarding and payroll.

   *Anomaly:* Failing to incorporate a choice after the decision step is a conceptual flaw. The process does not reflect the possibility of rejecting candidates.

**Severity of Anomalies in Model 1:**  
- **Severe**: Making the hiring decision without the guarantee of completed interviews.  
- **Moderate**: Lack of a branching structure for negative hiring decisions (assuming all decisions are positive).

Despite these flaws, the process in Model 1 maintains a mostly linear and logical “happy path”: Post → Screen → (Interview & Decide) → Onboard → Payroll → Close. The main issue is out-of-order decision-making and no negative scenario handling.

### Analysis of POWL Model 2

**Model Structure (with operators):**
```
Post 
 ├─> Screen
 └─> Interview
      └─> Decide 
           └─> loop_onboarding(*)
                ├─> Onboard_Employee
                └─> skip
           └─> xor_payroll(X)
                ├─> Add_to_Payroll
                └─> skip
           └─> Close
```

**Key Observations:**

1. **Parallel or Unstructured Execution of Screening and Interviews**:  
   From “Post_Job_Ad,” the model goes to both “Screen_Candidates” and “Conduct_Interviews.” Similar to Model 1, there is no enforced order that ensures candidates are screened before interviews. While parallelism can sometimes be acceptable, it is not ideal for a standard, logical sequence. Typically, screening is meant to narrow down candidates before interviews begin.

   *Anomaly:* Interviews can occur without proper screening, or screening can occur simultaneously or after interviews. This undermines the standard logical order.

2. **Loop on Onboarding (loop_onboarding)**:  
   After making a decision, the model places “Onboard_Employee” inside a loop operator along with a “skip” transition. This means you can repeatedly onboard (possibly implying multiple hires) or skip onboarding entirely.

   *Anomaly:* Having the ability to skip onboarding after a positive hiring decision is a major deviation. In a normative process, once you decide to hire, onboarding should not be optional.

3. **XOR at Payroll (xor_payroll)**:  
   After the onboarding loop, the process encounters an XOR between “Add_to_Payroll” and a “skip” transition. This implies that you can either add the employee to the payroll or skip this step entirely.

   *Anomaly:* Skipping payroll for a hired employee makes no logical sense in a typical hire-to-retire scenario. Adding someone to payroll is a mandatory step if they are indeed hired.

4. **Lack of Explicit Negative Path**:  
   The model does not clearly show what happens if the hiring decision is negative. Unlike Model 1’s linear approach, Model 2 uses operators that allow optional skipping of core activities. The absence of a proper negative decision branch still remains a conceptual gap.

**Severity of Anomalies in Model 2:**  
- **Severe**: The ability to skip critical steps like onboarding and payroll after a decision. This goes against fundamental hiring logic.  
- **Significant**: No guaranteed sequencing between screening and interviews.  
- **Structural Deviation**: The loop and XOR structures introduce complexity that does not reflect standard logic, allowing non-normative shortcuts (skipping essential steps).

### Comparing the Models

- **Model 1** has a mostly linear structure that reflects the main steps of hiring. Its major flaw is not ensuring that interviews precede the decision and not providing a negative branch. Still, it captures a straightforward “happy path”: post, screen, then eventually decide, onboard, payroll, and close.

- **Model 2** introduces structural complexity that deviates more fundamentally from a normative logic. It allows skipping critical steps like onboarding and payroll even after a hiring decision, and does not enforce proper sequencing between screening and interviews. The use of loop and XOR operators to potentially omit mandatory steps (onboarding, payroll) is a more severe departure from standard hiring logic.

**Conclusion:**  
**Model 1** more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process. While it has notable anomalies (chiefly allowing a decision without guaranteeing the candidate has been interviewed and failing to account for negative decisions), these issues are less severe than the anomalies in Model 2, where key steps like onboarding and payroll can be entirely bypassed. Model 1 at least maintains a core linear sequence and retains the essence of the standard process, despite needing refinement for logical ordering and decision branching.
