The diagram is a swimlane flowchart representing the process of shipping goods from a Computer Hardware Shop. It is divided into three swimlanes: Dispatch of goods, Computer Hardware Shop (Secretary), and Warehouse. The process begins with the initiation of shipping goods, followed by clarifying the shipment method. If special handling is required, the process diverges to check if insurance is necessary, which may involve insuring the parcel. The Secretary then obtains offers from three logistic companies and selects one to place the order. Concurrently, the goods are packaged in the Warehouse, with a 48-hour delay notification sent to the customer if necessary. Once packaged, the shipment paperwork is filled out, and the package is moved to the pickup area, marking the shipment as prepared. The diagram illustrates the sequential and parallel tasks involved in shipping goods, emphasizing the coordination between the Secretary and the Warehouse, and the decision points regarding special handling and insurance.
