The process described by the data represents a workflow for handling declarations, likely for expense claims or financial requests, in an organizational setting. Here is a summary of the process and the flow of its activities:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: This is the initial step in the process where an employee submits a request or declaration.

2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**: An administrative figure or department reviews and approves the submission.

3. **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER** or **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**: Depending on the organization's setup, the declaration may go through an additional approval step. This could be either from a budget owner (who controls the relevant budget) or a pre-approver (prior to final approval).

4. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: A supervisor or another designated individual gives the final approval before the next steps.

5. **Request Payment**: After all necessary approvals, a formal request for payment is made.

6. **Payment Handled**: The payment for the request is processed and completed.

The process variants listed show different paths a declaration can take, with each variant having a "frequency" (how often it occurs) and "performance" (which may refer to total time taken in milliseconds or another metric).

The presence of "Declaration REJECTED" steps at various points indicates that the process can have rejections. If a declaration is rejected, it may go back to the employee for adjustments or correction before being resubmitted. This rejection can occur at different stages (e.g., by administration, supervisor, budget owner, or pre-approver).

The variant "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" suggests that employees can save their declarations as drafts before submission for approval. A step labeled "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" indicates there might be missing information or approval, which leads to the rejection of the declaration.

Additionally, the process seems to allow for multiple iterations of rejection and resubmission, indicated by repeated steps like "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE". This loop can be repeated multiple times as seen in some variants, which shows the iterative nature of addressing issues until the declaration is finalized.

A cautionary note here: The term "performance" in the context provided might not strictly mean performance in the traditional sense of efficiency or effectiveness but might instead be a measure of the total amount of time taken to complete the process in a given metric (e.g., milliseconds).
