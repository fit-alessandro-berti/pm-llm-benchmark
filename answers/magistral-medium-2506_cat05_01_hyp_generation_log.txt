# Process Analysis Report

## Key Observations and Anomalies

1. **Process Flow Violations:**
   - Case 1002: The process skipped the normal sequence by confirming shipment before credit check and stock validation.
   - Case 1004: The payment was received before invoice was issued, and shipment was confirmed before goods were shipped.

2. **Potential Compliance Issues:**
   - Case 1004 shows payment received before proper process completion (shipment confirmation before actual shipping).

3. **Unusual Timing Patterns:**
   - Several cases show very quick transitions between activities that normally require more time (e.g., payment received immediately after order registration in case 1004).

4. **Role-Based Anomalies:**
   - Some activities appear to be performed by different departments than expected based on the standard process flow.

## Hypothesized Causes

1. **Process Sequence Violations:**
   - Possible system errors or overrides allowing out-of-order processing
   - Manual interventions bypassing standard workflows
   - Insufficient process enforcement in the order management system

2. **Payment Timing Issues:**
   - Pre-payment orders may follow a different workflow not properly documented
   - Possible data entry errors in timestamp recording
   - Special handling for certain customers or order types

3. **Resource Role Mismatches:**
   - Employees performing tasks outside their normal responsibilities
   - Temporary role assignments not properly documented
   - Cross-training resulting in flexible task assignment

SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, r.department

    -- Credit checks should be done by Finance

    -- Logistics activities should be done by Logistics department
    (oel.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment') AND r.department != 'Logistics');

-- Query 5: Find cases where standard process steps were skipped
SELECT o.case_id

    GROUP BY case_id

-- Query 6: Analyze average time between activities
SELECT

    second_activity.activity AS to_activity,

    COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count

    first_activity.case_id = second_activity.case_id AND
    first_activity.event_id + 1 = second_activity.event_id
GROUP BY from_activity, to_activity
ORDER BY from_activity, to_activity;

-- Query 7: Find cases with high value orders that had process deviations
SELECT o.case_id, o.order_value, e.activity_count

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Process Compliance Review:**
   - Audit the cases with out-of-sequence activities to determine if they were valid exceptions or process violations.
   - Review any manual override procedures that may allow bypassing normal workflows.

2. **System Configuration Check:**
   - Examine if the order management system has proper constraints to enforce process flow.
   - Verify timestamp recording mechanisms to ensure accurate time tracking.

3. **Role and Permission Review:**
   - Investigate cases where activities were performed by unexpected roles.
   - Review cross-training programs to ensure proper documentation of expanded responsibilities.

4. **Payment Process Analysis:**
   - Specifically examine case 1004 and similar cases to understand why payment was received before completion of standard process steps.
   - Determine if this represents a different order type (e.g., pre-paid orders) that should have its own documented process.

5. **Performance Metrics Analysis:**
   - Review the timing data to establish reasonable benchmarks for each process step.
   - Identify bottlenecks where cases spend an unusually long time between activities.

These queries and investigations will help identify systemic issues, training needs, or process improvements that could enhance operational efficiency and compliance.
