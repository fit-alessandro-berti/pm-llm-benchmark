Got it — based on your description, here’s a set of **targeted, open-ended clarification questions** I would ask to better understand your property onboarding process and capture all the subtleties in timing, decision points, stakeholders, and exceptions.  

---

### **Clarifying the Start of the Process**
1. How do landlords usually initiate contact — is it always via the regional office, or are there other entry points (e.g., website, referrals, corporate headquarters)?
2. How is the initial request documented and tracked before the property coordinator gets involved?  

---

### **Documentation & Verification**
3. What specific criteria or checklist do property coordinators use to determine if documentation is complete and valid?  
4. If a required document is outdated, is there a standard grace period or fast-track method for moving forward while waiting for updated paperwork?  
5. Do coordinators have the authority to reject a property outright, or must decisions be escalated?  

---

### **Property Data Entry**
6. Is the property data entered all at once after verification, or is partial data entered earlier so other teams can start their work in parallel?  
7. Who is responsible for ensuring data accuracy once it’s in the central property database?  

---

### **Assigning a Property Manager**
8. What tools or criteria are used to assess a manager’s current workload and suitability for a particular property?  
9. In cases where several managers are equally qualified, how is the final assignment decided?  
10. Are landlords ever allowed to request a specific property manager?  

---

### **Introductory Meeting & Agreement Setup**
11. Is there a predefined agenda or checklist for the introductory call with the landlord?  
12. How are special conditions or landlord-specific policies documented and shared with relevant teams?  

---

### **Inspections & Photography**
13. Who actually schedules the photographer and inspector — the property manager or an administrative support role?  
14. How are conflicts handled if the landlord cannot accommodate the proposed inspection date?  
15. What happens if the inspection uncovers major code violations or hazards — does onboarding pause until resolved?  

---

### **Repairs & Contractor Management**
16. How is vendor selection handled for repairs — standard approved contractor list, landlord choice, or competitive bids?  
17. Are costs for repairs negotiated at this stage, and who holds financial responsibility?  

---

### **Marketing Preparation**
18. How does the marketing team coordinate with the property manager — do they wait for the “inspection pass” flag before starting?  
19. Are pricing models automatically generated, or can managers/manual overrides adjust them?  

---

### **Tenant Screening & Leasing**
20. At what stage can prospective tenants begin viewing the property — only after marketing goes live, or earlier?  
21. How does the team prioritize between tenants with strong qualifications but short leases versus average qualifications but long leases?  
22. Are lease negotiations handled solely by the property manager, or does legal/compliance get involved earlier?  

---

### **Quality Checks & Audits**
23. Do quality checks happen at a single stage after leasing, or throughout the process as milestones are completed?  
24. Who has the final authority to approve a property as “fully onboarded” into the portfolio?  

---

### **Exception Handling**
25. Can you describe some recent examples of onboarding exceptions — e.g., special insurance requirements or custom lease clauses — and how they were resolved?  
26. Is there a formal escalation path if stakeholders disagree on a decision during onboarding?  

---

### **Timing & Sequencing**
27. What is the average total duration from initial landlord contact to tenant move-in?  
28. Which steps often run in parallel, and which must always be sequential?  
29. Which steps are most prone to delays, and what mitigation strategies are used?  

---

### **Systems & Communication**
30. What systems are most critical to this workflow (CRM, property management system, project management tool), and how do they integrate?  
31. How is communication with the landlord tracked to ensure nothing falls through the cracks?  
32. Are there automated alerts for important milestones or deadlines in the onboarding process?

If you want, I can **turn these questions into a structured process mapping and decision-point diagram** so every role, document, and condition is visually clear. That would make it easier to spot bottlenecks and exceptions.  

Do you want me to prepare that?
