Some anomalies in the proposed process model include:
- There is a 'Never Together' constraint between 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' and 'Payment Handled', but there is also an 'Always Before' constraint between them, which contradicts each other.
- The activity occurrences for 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' includes the value 6, which is not allowed according to the defined bounds.
- There is a 'Directly-Follows Constraints' between 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING', but there is also an 'Always After' constraint between them, which contradicts each other.
- There are 'Never Together' constraints between 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE', but there are also 'Always Before' constraints between them, which contradicts each other.
