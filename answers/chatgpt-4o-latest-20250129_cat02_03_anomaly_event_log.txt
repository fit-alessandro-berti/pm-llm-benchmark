### **Analysis of Anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Process Event Log**

The standard **Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process** generally follows this sequence:  
1. **Create Purchase Requisition** → 2. **Approve Purchase Requisition** → 3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)** → 4. **Receive Goods** → 5. **Vendor Invoice Received** → 6. **Match Invoice to PO** → 7. **Release Payment** → 8. **Close Case**  

Given this expected sequence, let's analyze each case to identify **anomalies**.

### **Case 1002: Out-of-Order Approval and Payment Before Receipt**
| Activity | Timestamp |
|----------|------------|
| **Create Purchase Requisition** | 2024-02-01 08:30 |
| **Issue Purchase Order (before approval!)** | 2024-02-01 08:40 |
| **Vendor Invoice Received (before goods receipt!)** | 2024-02-03 07:00 |
| **Release Payment (before approval and goods receipt!)** | 2024-02-03 07:15 |
| **Approve Purchase Requisition (after payment!)** | 2024-02-03 08:00 |
| **Receive Goods (after payment!)** | 2024-02-04 09:00 |
| **Match Invoice to PO (too late, after payment!)** | 2024-02-05 08:00 |

**Issues:**
1. **Purchase Order Issued Before Approval**  
   - In most organizations, a purchase requisition **must be approved** before issuing a purchase order.  
   - Skipping approval could lead to unauthorized or unnecessary purchases.

2. **Payment Released Before Goods Were Received**  
   - Payments should only be made after verifying that the ordered goods have arrived in acceptable condition.  
   - This creates a risk of paying for goods that were never delivered or were defective.

3. **Invoice Matching Occurs After Payment**  
   - Invoice matching (checking invoice against PO and receipt) should happen **before** payment to ensure accuracy.  
   - Late invoice matching increases the risk of fraud or overpayments.

**Possible Risks:**
- Financial losses due to incorrect or fraudulent invoices.  
- Lack of control over procurement approvals.  
- Compliance violations in regulated industries.

### **Case 1003: Payment Before Invoice Receipt and Goods Delivery**
| Activity | Timestamp |
|----------|------------|
| **Create Purchase Requisition** | 2024-02-02 09:00 |
| **Approve Purchase Requisition** | 2024-02-02 09:10 |
| **Issue Purchase Order** | 2024-02-02 10:00 |
| **Release Payment (before invoice and goods receipt!)** | 2024-02-08 11:00 |
| **Vendor Invoice Received (after payment!)** | 2024-02-09 12:00 |
| **Receive Goods (after payment!)** | 2024-02-10 13:00 |
| **Match Invoice to PO (too late, after payment!)** | 2024-02-11 14:00 |

**Issues:**
1. **Payment Released Before Invoice and Goods Receipt**  
   - Payments should be processed only after confirming invoice accuracy and receiving the goods.  
   - This increases the risk of paying for **goods that were never delivered or billed incorrectly**.

2. **Invoice and Goods Arrive After Payment**  
   - This is a major red flag in **internal controls** since there is no verification before payment.  
   - There is no way to verify that what was ordered was actually received.

**Possible Risks:**
- Vendor may not fulfill the order after being paid.  
- Fraudulent invoices might go unnoticed.  
- Violation of accounting best practices and audit compliance.

### **Case 1004: Goods Received Before Purchase Order Issued**
| Activity | Timestamp |
|----------|------------|
| **Create Purchase Requisition** | 2024-02-05 10:00 |
| **Approve Purchase Requisition** | 2024-02-05 10:15 |
| **Receive Goods (before PO issuance!)** | 2024-02-06 09:00 |
| **Issue Purchase Order (after goods receipt!)** | 2024-02-06 09:15 |

**Issues:**
1. **Goods Received Before a Purchase Order Was Issued**  
   - Typically, goods should **not** be received until after a PO has been issued.  
   - This suggests that the vendor delivered goods **without formal authorization**, which could indicate **maverick spending** (unauthorized purchases outside standard procurement processes).

**Possible Risks:**
- No contractual obligation to pay the vendor (since no formal PO existed).  
- Lack of documentation for received goods.  
- Compliance violations, especially in industries with **strict procurement policies**.

### **Conclusion: Key Anomalies Identified**
| Case | Anomaly | Business Risk |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **1002** | Payment released **before approval and goods receipt** | Risk of unauthorized purchases and financial loss |
| **1003** | Payment released **before invoice and goods receipt** | Overpayment risk, fraud potential |
| **1004** | Goods received **before issuing a purchase order** | Lack of control, compliance issues |

Each of these cases presents **serious risks**, including **fraud, financial loss, compliance violations, and poor internal controls**. In a well-controlled P2P process, approvals should occur in sequence, payments should only be made after invoice matching, and goods should never be received without a prior purchase order.
