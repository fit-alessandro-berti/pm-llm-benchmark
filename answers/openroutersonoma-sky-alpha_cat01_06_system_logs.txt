### Transformed Process Mining Event Log

I have transformed the raw system log into an event log suitable for standard process mining tools (e.g., ProM, Celonis, or Disco). The log is presented as a tabular format (using Markdown for readability; in practice, this could be exported as CSV or XES). Each row represents a single event. Events are sorted by timestamp globally, but process mining tools will group and sort them per Case ID by timestamp for analysis.

Key transformations applied:
- **Case ID**: Assigned based on the primary window/document/task (e.g., "Document1.docx" for all events related to editing that file). This treats each document or task (like email handling) as a logical process instance, allowing analysis of interleaved work across files.
- **Activity Name**: Mapped raw actions to higher-level, standardized process steps. For example:
  - FOCUS or SWITCH to a document  "Open Document" (or equivalent for app type, e.g., "Open Spreadsheet").
  - TYPING  "Edit Content" (with details from Keys).
  - SAVE  "Save File".
  - CLICK  Specific action-based name (e.g., "Open Email", "Send Email").
  - SCROLL  "Review Content".
  - HIGHLIGHT  "Annotate Document".
  - CLOSE  "Close Document".
  - SWITCH events are not rows themselves but trigger "Open ..." events for the target case (to capture transitions without redundant "switch" activities).
- **Timestamp**: Retained exactly as in the log.
- **Additional Attributes**: 
  - **App**: The application (e.g., "Microsoft Word").
  - **Details**: Derived from raw attributes like Keys, Action, or Text for context (useful for filtering or drill-down in analysis).
- Only meaningful actions are included; pure navigation without content change (e.g., direction in SCROLL) is generalized. No events were added or removed arbitrarily— all raw lines are accounted for via mapping.
- Total events: 19 (covering all 18 raw lines, with 1 SWITCH-to mapping creating an extra "Open" event for completeness).

### Explanation of Logic
I grouped events into cases by associating each action with its primary window/document/task, creating coherent process instances for user work on specific items (e.g., "Document1.docx" as one case for all its editing sessions, even with interleaving, to capture a full lifecycle like open-edit-save-close). This is based on temporal sequences and context: related actions on the same file (e.g., initial editing and later budget reference insertion in Document1.docx) belong to one case, while distinct tasks like email handling or PDF review form separate cases. Switches and focuses were inferred as "Open ..." events for the target case to mark session starts/resumes, ensuring cases begin logically without gaps. Activity names were standardized to higher-level steps (e.g., all TYPING  "Edit Content" for consistency across apps, with details preserving specifics) to enable process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis (e.g., bottlenecks in editing vs. reviewing). This results in an analyst-friendly log showing interleaved workflows, such as how budget updates support document editing, while keeping activities general yet descriptive for cross-case comparison. If needed, further aggregation (e.g., merging multiple "Edit Content" into one) could be done in tools like ProM.
