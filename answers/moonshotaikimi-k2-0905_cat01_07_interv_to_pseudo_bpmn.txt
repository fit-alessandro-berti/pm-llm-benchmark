Textual BPMN-like Process Model  
“Invoice-to-Payment” (Accounts-Payable)

Legend  
Lane 1: Accounts-Payable Clerk (Mary)  
Lane 2: Purchasing (Dan)  
Lane 3: Dept. Manager (Carlos)  
Lane 4: AP Supervisor / Supplier-Relations (Rita)  
Lane 5: System / Data Objects

Start Event  
[Invoice received by e-mail]

Sequence Flow  
1. Mary (Lane 1) – Task “Check PO reference on invoice”  
   - Input: Invoice PDF  
   - Output: Invoice-with-PO or Invoice-without-PO  

2. Exclusive Gateway “PO present & valid?”  
   - NO   Task “E-mail supplier for missing PO” (Lane 1)  
            Loop back to Start Event (supplier re-submits)  
   - YES  Task “Log invoice in accounting system” (Lane 1)  
           - Data store: Accounting-System (Lane 5)

3. Task “Forward invoice to Purchasing for Goods-Receipt check” (Lane 1)  
   - Data object: Invoice-record (status = Awaiting-GR)

4. Purchasing (Lane 2) – Task “Confirm goods/services received vs PO”  
   - Input: Invoice-record + PO  
   - Output: GR-Confirmed or Discrepancy-Detected  

5. Exclusive Gateway “Invoice = PO?”  
   - DISCREPANCY  Task “Request corrected invoice or clarification” (Lane 2)  
                   - Option 1: Supplier issues credit-note/re-issue (external)  
                   - Option 2: Invoice held in “Pending-Correction”  
                   - Loop-back to #4 when corrected invoice arrives  
   - OK  Task “Send GR-confirmation e-mail to AP” (Lane 2)  
          - Data store: Accounting-System (status = Ready-for-Manager)

6. Task “Perform 3-way match” (Lane 1)  
   - System matches Invoice-line-items vs PO vs GR-confirmation  

7. Exclusive Gateway “Match successful?”  
   - MISMATCH  Task “E-mail Purchasing to clarify” (Lane 1)  
                - If resolved quickly: return to #6  
                - Else  Escalate (see Exception-A below)  
   - MATCH  automatic e-mail notification triggered (Lane 5)  Manager

8. Manager (Lane 3) – Task “Review & Approve invoice”  
   - Input: Invoice-package (invoice, PO, GR-confirmation)  
   - Decision options:  
         a) APPROVE  System sets status = Approved  
         b) REJECT  Task “Notify AP to investigate” (Lane 3)  
                     - Invoice returns to “Pending-Correction” (loop to #5)  

9. Task “Schedule invoice for next payment run” (Lane 1)  
   - Output: Payment-Batch list  

End Event  
[Invoice sent to Payment]

---------------------------------------------
Exception & Alternate Paths  

Exception-A “Unresolvable mismatch / no PO”  
- Escalation Gateway after #7 (or earlier if PO missing)  
- Task “Escalate to AP Supervisor” (Lane 1)  
  - Lane 4: Rita – Task “Coordinate exception resolution”  
    - Sub-tasks: contact supplier (with Karen), create retrospective PO, or reject  
  - When cleared: loop back to #4 or #6 as appropriate  

Exception-B “Manager budgetary concern”  
- Occurs at #8 if manager rejects for budget variance  
- Invoice re-enters clarification loop; may require department-head sign-off (not modelled in detail)  

Exception-C “Supplier relationship issue”  
- Any discrepancy can invoke parallel task “Karen negotiates with supplier” (Lane 4) – informational, does not block flow once resolved.  

---------------------------------------------
Roles summary  
- Mary: first point of contact, logging, matching, scheduling  
- Dan: purchasing validation & goods-receipt confirmation  
- Carlos: financial & budgetary approval  
- Rita / Karen: exception handling & supplier liaison  
- System: stores documents, triggers e-mails, records status  

---------------------------------------------
Ambiguity Notes  
- Interview accounts imply that “3-way match” (#6) is sometimes done before Purchasing confirmation; model shows it strictly after to preserve control objective.  
- No explicit timing for “next payment run” – scheduled at AP discretion.  
- If supplier sends unsolicited corrected invoice, entry point is still Start Event; previous version is cancelled in system (behaviour not detailed).
