This is a business process diagram (appears to be in BPMN notation) that illustrates a shipping/logistics workflow. The diagram is organized into three horizontal swim lanes representing different departments or roles:

**1. Logistics (top lane):**
- Contains an "Insure parcel" activity

**2. Secretariat/Distribution Express Stop (middle lane):**
- Starts with "Ship goods" (the process trigger)
- Includes a decision point for "Special handling?" 
- If yes: flows to "Clarify shipment method"
- If no: goes to "Order details"
- Contains activities like:
  - "Check if insurance is required" (with a decision diamond)
  - "Write package label" 
  - "Get 3 offers from logistic companies"
  - "Select logistic company and place order"
- Has a customer information database symbol

**3. Warehouse (bottom lane):**
- Shows "Package goods" activity with a 48-hour timer attached
- "Notify customer about delay" activity
- "Fill out Shipment paperwork" 
- "Move package to pickup area"
- Ends with "Shipment prepared" (the end event)

The diagram uses standard BPMN symbols including:
- Rounded rectangles for activities/tasks
- Diamonds for decision points (gateways)
- Circles for start/end events
- Solid arrows showing the process flow
- A database symbol for customer information storage

The process depicts the complete workflow from receiving a shipping request through to preparing the shipment for pickup, with different departments handling their respective responsibilities.
