Excellent. Here is a BPMN-like textual process model derived from the provided interview excerpts.

### **BPMN-like Textual Model: Invoice Approval Process**

#### **1. Process Summary**

This model describes the end-to-end process for handling and approving supplier invoices. The process begins upon receipt of an invoice and concludes when the invoice is scheduled for payment. It involves multiple roles across the Accounts Payable (AP) and Purchasing departments, with key approval from a Department Manager and exception handling by an AP Supervisor.

#### **2. Participants / Roles (Pools & Lanes)**

*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** (Primary Actor: Mary)
*   **Purchasing Officer** (Primary Actor: Dan)
*   **Department Manager** (Primary Actor: Carlos)
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Supervisor** (Primary Actor: Rita)
*   **External Participants:**
    *   **Supplier** (Sends invoice, provides clarifications)
    *   **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Ad-hoc support role for resolving issues, Actor: Karen)

#### **3. Artifacts / Data Objects**

*   **Invoice:** The primary document that initiates and flows through the process.
*   **Purchase Order (PO):** A critical reference document used for validation.
*   **Confirmation Email:** An artifact used for handoff between Purchasing and AP.

### **5. Exceptions and Variations**

**Exception Path 1: Missing Purchase Order**
*   **Trigger:** Invoice arrives without a PO number.
*   **Simple Path (AP Clerk):**
    *   **Task:** Request PO from Supplier.
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The clerk emails the supplier to request a corrected invoice with the PO number.
    *   **End:** The process for this specific invoice instance terminates or waits for a new invoice to arrive.
*   **Complex Path (Escalation):**
    *   **Trigger:** Invoice is for informally contracted services and has no PO.
    *   **Task:** Escalate to AP Supervisor.
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Sub-process (AP Supervisor):** The AP Supervisor works with the Department Manager to either **create a retrospective PO** or **formally reject the invoice**. If resolved, the invoice re-enters the main flow at the "Log Invoice in System" step.

**Exception Path 2: Goods Receipt Discrepancy**
*   **Trigger:** Purchasing Officer finds a mismatch during goods receipt confirmation.
*   **Task:** Resolve Discrepancy.
*   **Role:** Purchasing Officer
*   **Description:** The officer either contacts the supplier directly to resolve the issue or requests that the AP Clerk puts the invoice on hold. The **Supplier Relationship Manager** may be looped in at this stage to facilitate communication with the supplier. Once resolved (e.g., a corrected invoice is received), the process returns to the **"Send Confirmation to AP"** task.

**Exception Path 3: Invoice-PO Matching Discrepancy**
*   **Trigger:** AP Clerk finds a discrepancy between the invoice and PO line items.
*   **Path A (Simple Clarification):**
    *   **Task:** Request Clarification from Purchasing.
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The clerk sends the invoice back to the Purchasing Officer for review, creating a rework loop.
*   **Path B (Complex Escalation):**
    *   **Trigger:** The discrepancy cannot be easily resolved between AP and Purchasing.
    *   **Task:** Escalate to AP Supervisor.
    *   **Role:** AP Clerk
    *   **Sub-process (AP Supervisor):** The supervisor coordinates between departments and/or suppliers to resolve the issue. Once resolved, the invoice re-enters the main flow at the **"Match Invoice to PO"** step for final validation.

**Exception Path 4: Manager Rejection**
*   **Trigger:** The Department Manager rejects the invoice or puts it on hold.
*   **Task:** Investigate Manager's Concerns.
*   **Role:** AP Clerk
*   **Description:** The invoice is sent back to the AP Clerk with notes from the manager. The clerk investigates the issue, potentially re-engaging Purchasing or the Supervisor. Once addressed, the invoice is sent back to the **"Forward for Manager Approval"** step.
