### **BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

This model describes the invoice approval workflow based on consolidated accounts from Accounts Payable, Purchasing, and Management.

**1. Participants (Pools/Lanes):**
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk:** The primary process driver (Mary's role).
*   **Purchasing Officer:** Responsible for goods receipt confirmation (Dan's role).
*   **Department Manager:** Final approver (Carlos's role).
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Supervisor:** Handles escalated exceptions (Rita's role).
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager:** Ad-hoc participant for resolving supplier issues (Karen's role).
*   **System:** The accounting/workflow system.
*   **Supplier:** External participant who submits the invoice.

**2. Artifacts (Data Objects):**
*   **Invoice:** The primary document that triggers and moves through the process.
*   **Purchase Order (PO):** A reference document used for validation throughout the process.

### **3. Main Process Flow (The "Happy Path")**

**Start Event:** An invoice is received from a supplier, typically via email.

1.  **Task: Check for PO Number**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The clerk inspects the received invoice to determine if a valid Purchase Order number is present.
    *   **Next:** This leads to a decision point.

2.  **Gateway (Exclusive): Is PO Number Present?**
    *   **Condition:** The AP Clerk's check in the previous step.
    *   **Path (Yes):** The process continues to Step 3.
    *   **Path (No):** The process moves to **Exception Flow A**.

3.  **Task: Log Invoice in Accounting System**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The invoice details are entered into the central accounting system.
    *   **Next:** The invoice is forwarded for receipt confirmation.

4.  **Task: Forward Invoice for Goods Receipt Confirmation**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The clerk sends the logged invoice to the Purchasing department.
    *   **Handoff:** The process moves to the **Purchasing Officer** lane.

5.  **Task: Confirm Goods/Services Receipt**
    *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer
    *   **Description:** The Purchasing Officer compares the invoice details (quantities, items, charges) against the corresponding PO to confirm that the goods or services were delivered as ordered.
    *   **Next:** This leads to a decision point.

6.  **Gateway (Exclusive): Does Invoice Align with PO/Delivery?**
    *   **Condition:** The outcome of the Purchasing Officer's check.
    *   **Path (Yes):** The process continues to Step 7.
    *   **Path (No):** The process moves to **Exception Flow B**.

7.  **Task: Send Confirmation to AP**
    *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer
    *   **Description:** An email or system notification is sent back to the AP Clerk confirming the receipt and correctness of the order.
    *   **Handoff:** The process moves back to the **AP Clerk** lane.

8.  **Task: Match Invoice to PO in System**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The AP Clerk performs a final, formal match of the invoice line items against the PO within the accounting system.
    *   **Next:** This leads to a decision point.

9.  **Gateway (Exclusive): Does Invoice Match PO?**
    *   **Condition:** The outcome of the system match.
    *   **Path (Yes):** The process continues to Step 10.
    *   **Path (No):** The process moves to **Exception Flow C**.

10. **System Task: Send Approval Request to Manager**
    *   **Actor:** System
    *   **Description:** The system automatically generates and sends a notification to the relevant Department Manager for final sign-off.
    *   **Handoff:** The process moves to the **Department Manager** lane.

11. **Task: Review and Approve/Reject Invoice**
    *   **Actor:** Department Manager
    *   **Description:** The manager reviews the invoice, PO, and confirmation details within the system.
    *   **Next:** This leads to a decision point.

12. **Gateway (Exclusive): Manager Approval Decision**
    *   **Condition:** The manager's choice to approve or reject.
    *   **Path (Approve):** The process continues to Step 13.
    *   **Path (Reject/Hold):** The process moves to **Exception Flow D**.

13. **Task: Schedule Invoice for Payment**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** Upon receiving the manager's approval, the AP Clerk schedules the invoice for inclusion in the next payment run.
    *   **Handoff:** The process returns to the **AP Clerk** lane for the final step.

**End Event:** The invoice is successfully scheduled for payment.

### **4. Exceptions and Alternate Flows**

**Exception Flow A: Missing PO Number**
*   **Trigger:** Gateway at Step 2 returns "No".
*   **Actor(s):** AP Clerk, Supplier Relationship Manager.
*   **Flow:**
    1.  **Task: Request PO from Supplier.** The AP Clerk sends the invoice back to the supplier requesting the PO number.
    2.  *(Optional Task)*: **Liaise with Supplier.** If necessary, the Supplier Relationship Manager is looped in to contact the supplier and retrieve the missing information.
*   **End Event:** **Invoice Rejected (Awaiting Correction).** The process for this specific invoice instance terminates. A new process instance will begin upon receipt of a corrected invoice.

**Exception Flow B: Incorrect Goods/Services Confirmation**
*   **Trigger:** Gateway at Step 6 returns "No".
*   **Actor(s):** Purchasing Officer, AP Clerk.
*   **Flow (Consolidated from multiple accounts):** One of two paths is taken.
    *   **Path 1:** **Task: Contact Supplier for Correction.** The Purchasing Officer directly contacts the supplier to resolve the discrepancy. The process is paused.
    *   **Path 2:** **Task: Notify AP to Hold Invoice.** The Purchasing Officer informs the AP Clerk to hold the invoice until the supplier sends a corrected version.
*   **Resolution:** The process is paused until a corrected invoice is received, at which point it may re-start from the beginning.

**Exception Flow C: Invoice/PO Discrepancy (AP Clerk)**
*   **Trigger:** Gateway at Step 9 returns "No".
*   **Actor(s):** AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, AP Supervisor.
*   **Flow:**
    1.  **Task: Email Purchasing for Clarification.** The AP Clerk contacts the Purchasing Officer to investigate the discrepancy (e.g., incorrect pricing).
    2.  **Rework Loop:** The process loops back to the **Purchasing Officer** to investigate and resolve. If resolved, it returns to the AP Clerk.
    3.  **Gateway (Exclusive): Is Discrepancy Easily Resolvable?**
        *   **Condition:** The AP Clerk determines the issue is complex.
        *   **Path (No):** **Task: Escalate to AP Supervisor.** The invoice is sent to the AP Supervisor for advanced resolution. This moves the process to the **AP Supervisor** lane.

**Exception Flow D: Manager Rejection/Hold**
*   **Trigger:** Gateway at Step 12 returns "Reject/Hold".
*   **Actor(s):** Department Manager, AP Clerk.
*   **Flow:**
    1.  **Task: Notify AP of Rejection/Hold.** The manager rejects the invoice in the system, which notifies the AP Clerk.
    2.  **Task: Investigate Rejected Invoice.** The AP Clerk is tasked with investigating the reason for rejection, which may trigger a rework loop involving Purchasing, the Supervisor, or the Supplier.

**Exception Flow E: Escalation to Supervisor (General)**
*   **Trigger:** Any complex exception, such as from Flow C or a non-PO invoice.
*   **Actor(s):** AP Supervisor, Department Heads.
*   **Flow:**
    1.  **Task: Resolve Escalated Discrepancy.** The AP Supervisor coordinates between departments, contacts suppliers, or works with department heads to resolve the issue (e.g., creating a retrospective PO for an informal service contract).
*   **Resolution:** Once the issue is resolved, the AP Supervisor directs the invoice **back into the main process flow**, typically at Step 5 (Confirm Goods/Services Receipt) or Step 8 (Match Invoice to PO in System), depending on the nature of the resolution.
