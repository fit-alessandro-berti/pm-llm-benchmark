**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

1. **`coexistence: {"CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, ...}` :** This ensures that whenever a sensitive attribute like `ApplicantRace` is checked, a `ManualReview` must also occur. This encourages human oversight in potentially biased situations.

2. **`succession: {"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, ...}`:** This constrains the process so that a `BiasMitigationCheck` must happen immediately after an activity involving a sensitive attribute. This check can be designed to identify and mitigate potential bias before reaching a decision.

3. **`succession: {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, ...}`:**  This makes sure that `Approve` decisions can only follow a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This further enforces the idea that decisions should be informed by bias-reducing checks.

4. **Similar constraints for `CheckApplicantGender` and sensitive decision activities:** 
   The above principles are extended to handle other sensitive attributes (`ApplicantGender`) and sensitive decision events, like `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`.



These new constraints significantly reduce the risk of biased decisions by forcing the process to consider mitigating factors and human review in situations involving sensitive attributes


**Important Note:** 


* This is a simplified example. Real-world bias mitigation requires careful consideration of various factors and may involve more complex constraints and techniques.

* It's crucial to design the `BiasMitigationCheck` activity effectively and to continuously monitor and evaluate the model for unintended bias.
