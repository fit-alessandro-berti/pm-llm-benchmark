**Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Receive (R) to Approve (P):**  
   The average duration is approximately 25 hours, but the standard deviation is unusually low (only about 1 hour). This suggests that approval almost always occurs on a rigid schedule after receiving the claim, regardless of variation in claim complexity or other factors. Such uniformity is suspicious and may indicate either a fixed system rule or an automated process that bypasses normal review steps.

2. **Approve (P) to Notify (N):**  
   The average delay is extremely long (7 days) with a very large standard deviation (2 days). This wide variation implies that notifying the customer is highly inconsistent. Some notifications might be sent almost immediately while others are delayed for weeks. This could reflect internal backlogs, waiting for additional documentation, or a lack of standardized follow-up procedures.

3. **Assign (A) to Close (C):**  
   On average, the claim is closed about 2 hours after assignment, which is surprisingly quick. This suggests that some claims are being closed without the intermediate steps of evaluation or approval (or that these steps are happening too rapidly to be properly recorded). It may indicate an automated rejection process or an error in event logging.

4. **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N):**  
   Only 5 minutes on average separate evaluation from notification, which is suspiciously short. This could mean that the evaluation step is being recorded just moments before the notification is sent, with no real deliberation. It might reflect a system design where the evaluation and notification events are logged back-to-back due to automated workflows or a data entry shortcut.

**Possible Reasons for These Anomalies:**

- **Over-Automation or Pre-Set Timers:**  
  The low variability between Receive and Approve could be the result of an automated rule that approves claims after a set period, rather than based on actual review outcomes.

- **Resource Constraints and Backlogs:**  
  The erratic delays from Approve to Notify may stem from a shortage of staff or a backlog in administrative tasks. Claims might sit waiting for manual follow-up, causing sporadic and lengthy delays.

- **Process Shortcuts or Missing Data:**  
  Rapid closure after assignment or immediate notification post-evaluation might indicate that not all steps are properly recorded. Perhaps the system logs steps automatically without actual human intervention, or data entry is done in bulk at the end of the process rather than in real-time.

- **Irregular Application of Business Rules:**  
  Long and inconsistent delays could result from case-by-case handling, where certain types of claims or special requests cause outliers. Some adjusters or regions may handle claims differently, leading to timing anomalies.

**SQL Queries for Verification:**

1. **Identify Claims with Unusually Short R→P Durations:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id,
          MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'R') AS receive_time,
          MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'P') AS approve_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'P') 
                              - MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'R'))) AS duration_seconds
   FROM claim_events e
   JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
   GROUP BY c.claim_id
   HAVING (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'P') 
                               - MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'R'))) < 90000 - 3600
           OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'P') 
                                  - MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'R'))) > 90000 + 3600);
   ```
   This query looks for claims where the R→P duration significantly deviates from the expected 25 hours (90,000 seconds ± 3,600 seconds).

2. **Check if Certain Adjusters or Claim Types Correlate with Long P→N Delays:**  
   ```sql
   WITH times AS (
     SELECT c.claim_id,
            c.claim_type,
            (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'N') 
             - MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'P')) AS p_to_n_interval
     FROM claims c
     JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
     GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type
   )
   SELECT claim_type,
          AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p_to_n_interval)) AS avg_p_to_n_seconds,
          STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p_to_n_interval)) AS stddev_p_to_n_seconds
   FROM times
   GROUP BY claim_type
   ORDER BY avg_p_to_n_seconds DESC;
   ```
   This query calculates the average and standard deviation of the P→N delay by claim type to see if certain claim categories are more affected.

3. **Investigate Claims Closed Quickly After Assignment:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id,
          c.claim_type,
          MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'A') AS assign_time,
          MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'C') AS close_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'C') 
                              - MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'A'))) AS duration_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
   GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type
   HAVING (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'C') 
                               - MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'A'))) < 7200 - 3600
           OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'C') 
                                  - MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'A'))) > 7200 + 3600);
   ```
   This query identifies claims where closure occurs unusually early or late relative to the expected 2-hour interval.

4. **Correlate E→N Times with Regions or Adjusters:**
   ```sql
   WITH evaluation_to_notify AS (
     SELECT c.claim_id,
            MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'E') AS eval_time,
            MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'N') AS notify_time
     FROM claims c
     JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
     GROUP BY c.claim_id
   )
   SELECT a.region,
          AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.notify_time - n.eval_time))) AS avg_e_to_n_seconds,
          STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.notify_time - n.eval_time))) AS stddev_e_to_n_seconds
   FROM evaluation_to_notify n
   JOIN claim_events e ON n.claim_id = e.claim_id
   JOIN adjusters a ON e.resource = a.name
   WHERE e.activity = 'E' OR e.activity = 'N'
   GROUP BY a.region
   ORDER BY avg_e_to_n_seconds;
   ```
   This query helps determine if certain regions, via their assigned adjusters, correlate with the unusually rapid E→N timing, possibly pointing to regional practices or automated processes localized to certain offices.
