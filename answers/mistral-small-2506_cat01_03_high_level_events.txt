### **High-Level Process Steps and Grouping Rationale**

Based on the provided event log, we can identify the following high-level manufacturing process steps. Each step groups related low-level events that logically belong together in the workflow.

---

### **1. Material Preparation**
**Grouped Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
These events are all preparatory steps for the manufacturing process. They involve:
- Acquiring the raw material (retrieving, scanning).
- Setting up the material for further processing (placing, aligning).
- Conditioning the material (preheating).

This phase ensures the material is correctly identified, positioned, and ready for the next stage.

### **2. Assembly (Welding)**
**Grouped Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale:**
These events are part of the assembly phase, specifically welding. They involve:
- Preparing the tool (picking up the welding tool).
- Performing the welding operation (welding corners A and B).
- Verifying the quality of the weld (measuring integrity).

This step ensures the metal sheet is properly assembled and meets structural integrity standards.

---

### **3. Post-Processing (Coating & Drying)**
**Grouped Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
These events are part of the finishing phase, where the product is coated for protection and durability. They involve:
- Applying a protective layer (polyurethane coating).
- Ensuring the coating is properly dried (heating).

This step ensures the product is protected and ready for final inspection.

---

### **4. Quality Inspection**
**Grouped Events:**
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
This is the final verification step where an operator ensures the product meets all quality standards before completion. It involves:
- A manual or automated visual inspection to confirm no defects.

This step ensures the product is defect-free before packaging or further processing.

| **Post-Processing**      | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                                          |
| **Quality Inspection**   | Visual check                                                                                 |

### **Summary of Grouping Logic**
1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events that occur close together in time (e.g., welding steps) are grouped.
2. **Functional Similarity:** Events that serve the same purpose (e.g., material preparation steps) are grouped.
3. **Resource Consistency:** Events performed by the same or similar resources (e.g., welding tool operations) are grouped.
4. **Process Phase:** Events that logically belong to distinct manufacturing phases (e.g., assembly vs. quality inspection) are grouped separately.

This aggregation provides a clearer, more abstract view of the manufacturing process, making it easier to analyze workflow efficiency, bottlenecks, and compliance with standards.
