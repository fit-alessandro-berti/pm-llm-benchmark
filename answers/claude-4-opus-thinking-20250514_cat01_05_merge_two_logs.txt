## Merged Event Log Analysis and Integration

### Matching Decision Process

I analyzed both logs to identify corresponding events based on:
1. **Event semantic similarity** (e.g., "Order Received" vs "OrderReceived")
2. **Timestamp proximity** (within 2-second tolerance)
3. **Order ID match** (all events are for Order#1234)

### Matching Results:

**Merged Events (within 2-second tolerance):**
- **Order Received/OrderReceived**: 2-second difference (10:00:00 vs 09:59:58)
- **Order Validated/OrderValidation**: 1-second difference (10:01:30 vs 10:01:29)
- **Item Shipped/Shipping**: 2-second difference (10:05:00 vs 10:05:02)

**Kept Separate:**
- **Payment Processed vs PaymentCheck**: 5-second difference exceeds tolerance, and semantic differences suggest these may represent different stages (processing initiation vs verification)
- **Quality Check**: Only in Log B, no corresponding event in Log A
- **Item Delivered**: Only in Log A, no corresponding event in Log B

### Key Integration Decisions:

1. **Primary Timestamp Selection**: For merged events, I used Log A's timestamp as the primary since it was described as the "primary" timeline, while preserving both timestamps for reference.

2. **Payment Events Separation**: Despite semantic similarity, I kept "Payment Processed" and "Payment Check" separate because:
   - The 5-second gap exceeds the 2-second tolerance
   - Different naming suggests different stages (processing vs verification)
   - The Log B note mentions "Payment gateway delay" which supports this being a follow-up check

3. **Attribute Enrichment**: Merged events include all attributes from both logs, providing maximum information retention.

4. **Unique Events Preservation**: Events appearing in only one log (Quality Check, Item Delivered) were preserved with clear source attribution.

This merged log provides a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process, maintaining data integrity while enriching events with all available attributes from both systems.
