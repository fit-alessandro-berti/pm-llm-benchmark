Based on the Normative Process Description, we can establish the key mandatory constraints and conditional paths.

### Key Normative Constraints:

1.  **Start and End:** All processes must start with "Receive order" and end with "Close order."
2.  **Inventory Check Precedence:** "Check inventory" must occur after "Receive order" and before *any* decision about payment authorization or fulfillment (including packaging, shipping, or cancellation).
3.  **Sufficient Inventory Path (Fulfillment):** If inventory is sufficient (implied by non-cancellation):
    *   **Sequencing:** Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize Payment $\rightarrow$ Package $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close.
    *   **Precedence Rules:**
        *   Authorize Payment must follow Check Inventory.
        *   Package items must follow Authorize Payment.
        *   Ship order must follow Package items.
4.  **Insufficient Inventory Path (Cancellation):** If inventory is insufficient (implied by "Cancel order"):
    *   **Sequencing:** Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Cancel $\rightarrow$ Close.
    *   **Prohibition:** Activities intended for fulfillment (Authorize Payment, Package, Ship) must not occur after Cancel order.

## Analysis of Event Log Cases

### Case 1: (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ Package $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close)
**Path:** Fulfillment (Implied Sufficient Inventory)
**Evaluation:** This case perfectly follows the expected sequence for sufficient inventory.
**Violation:** **None.**

### Case 2: (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Package $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close)
**Path:** Fulfillment (Implied Sufficient Inventory)
**Evaluation:**
The sequence is: Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ **Package items** $\rightarrow$ **Authorize payment** $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close.
The description explicitly states: *"Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known."* Furthermore, it notes that a deviation would be: *"packaging items before authorization—would be considered a violation of the normative process."*
In Case 2, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
**Violation:** **Yes.**
**Explanation of Violation:** The sequence violates the precedence constraint requiring **Authorize payment** to occur before **Package items**.

### Case 3: (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ Cancel $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close)
**Path:** Mixed (Cancellation occurred)
**Evaluation:**
The sequence involves a "Cancel order" step. The normative description states that if cancellation occurs (due to insufficient inventory, though the condition isn't explicitly recorded here), fulfillment activities should stop: *"it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)"* and *"Ship order should... never after a cancellation."*
In this case, **Ship order** occurs after **Cancel order**. Additionally, "Authorize payment" occurs before cancellation, suggesting the process initially thought inventory was sufficient, but then changed course and canceled. However, the most definitive violation is the subsequent shipping.
**Violation:** **Yes.**
**Explanation of Violation:** The case violates the constraint that **Ship order** must not occur after **Cancel order**. Once the order is canceled, no further fulfillment steps (packaging or shipping) are permitted.

### Case 4: (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Cancel $\rightarrow$ Close)
**Path:** Cancellation (Implied Insufficient Inventory)
**Evaluation:** This case perfectly follows the expected sequence for insufficient inventory (Receive, Check, Cancel, Close). No fulfillment activities (Authorize, Package, Ship) occurred.
**Violation:** **None.**

### Case 5: (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close)
**Path:** Fulfillment (Implied Sufficient Inventory)
**Evaluation:**
The sequence is: Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close.
The normative description explicitly requires preparation before shipment: *"Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"*
The sequence is missing the "Package items" activity directly before "Ship order." This violates the precedence requirement: "Ship order should only occur after packaging."
**Violation:** **Yes.**
**Explanation of Violation:** The case violates the precedence constraint requiring **Package items** to occur before **Ship order**. The Packaging step was entirely skipped.

## Summary of Deviations

| Case ID | Deviation Status | Explanation of Violation |
| :------ | :--------------- | :----------------------- |
| 1       | Compliant        | Follows the successful fulfillment path. |
| 2       | **Deviates**     | **Package items** occurred before **Authorize payment**, violating the precedence constraint that payment must be authorized before packaging can begin. |
| 3       | **Deviates**     | **Ship order** occurred after **Cancel order**. Fulfillment activities (shipping) must cease once an order is canceled. |
| 4       | Compliant        | Follows the cancellation path correctly. |
| 5       | **Deviates**     | The activity **Package items** was skipped entirely. **Ship order** must only occur after the items have been packaged. |
