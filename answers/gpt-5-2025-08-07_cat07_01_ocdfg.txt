- It’s a process map that stitches together several related business objects into one endtoend flow. The objects across the top (with volumes) are PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M), SalesOrderItem (3.5M), PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M), VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M), and ReturnOrderItem (0.8M). Each has a Start node feeding into the flow; multiple End nodes sit at the bottom.

- Rectangles are activities; each shows “Overall: …” indicating how many times that step occurs in the dataset. Small colored dots on an activity indicate which object types participate in that step. Directed connectors show the order of steps; the numbers on the connectors (e.g., 300 ms, 650 ms) are average throughput times between the two steps.

- Central procurement branch: Start  Create Requisition (3.0M)  Approve Requisition (5.7M). From there the flow can go to Check Stock (1.0M), Send Order (5.2M), Process Return (0.8M), or toward payment and invoicing.

- Fulfillment (ordertocash) branch on the right: Create Order (8.5M)  Pack Goods (2.0M)  Ship Goods (1.8M)  Confirm Delivery (1.7M)  Close Order (1.7M)  End. The connectors show short average times between these steps (hundreds of milliseconds in the diagram).

- Finance branch: Approve Payment (1.5M)  Create Invoice (2.0M)  End. Some flows reach Create Invoice via Process Return or directly after Approve Payment.

- Return handling: ReturnOrderItem starts lead to Process Return (0.8M), which can feed into Create Invoice or interact with delivery/closure depending on the path.

- Overall read: The largest observed activity is Create Order (8.5M). Volumes drop as the process progresses through packing, shipping, delivery, and closure. Colored paths let you follow how each object type contributes, while the edge labels quantify the average time between steps.
