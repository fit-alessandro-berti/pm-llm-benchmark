Based on the provided data, it appears that the main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups are:

1. **Frequency of rejection**: The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of being rejected at various stages of the process compared to the protected group. For example, the frequency of rejection after the viewing appointment is set and the property is viewed is much higher in the unprotected group (2490 vs 484).

2. **Extensive Screening**: The protected group undergoes extensive screening more often than the unprotected group. This is evident in the process variants that include "Extensive Screening" before either signing a contract or rejecting the tenant.

3. **Time to cancellation**: The protected group tends to have a longer tenancy before cancellation compared to the unprotected group. This is indicated by the higher performance times associated with the process variants that end in "Tenant Cancels Apartment" in the protected group.

4. **Eviction**: There is one process variant in the protected group that includes "Issue Warning" and "Evict Tenant" after a missed rent payment, whereas no such process variant exists in the unprotected group.
