### Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Times for Each Case
To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, we calculate the total time from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket" for each case. The results are as follows:

| **Case ID** | **Start Time**       | **End Time**         | **Total Resolution Time** |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| 101         | 2024-03-01 08:00    | 2024-03-01 10:15    | **2 hours 15 minutes**    |
| 102         | 2024-03-01 08:05    | 2024-03-02 09:15    | **25 hours 10 minutes**   |
| 103         | 2024-03-01 08:10    | 2024-03-01 09:30    | **1 hour 20 minutes**     |
| 104         | 2024-03-01 08:20    | 2024-03-02 08:30    | **24 hours 10 minutes**   |
| 105         | 2024-03-01 08:25    | 2024-03-03 09:30    | **49 hours 5 minutes**    |

#### Observations:
- Cases **101** and **103** have relatively short resolution times (under 2.5 hours).
- Cases **102**, **104**, and **105** have significantly longer resolution times (24+ hours), with **105** being the longest at nearly 50 hours.

### Step 2: Analyze Potential Root Causes of Delays
We examine the event logs for these cases to identify patterns or factors contributing to delays.

#### Case 102:
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent**: This ticket was escalated after 3.5 hours (from "Assign to Level-1 Agent" to "Escalate to Level-2 Agent").
- **Long Waiting Time Before Investigation**: After escalation, there was a significant delay of **2.5 hours** before investigation began.
- **Resolution Delay**: The ticket was resolved the next day, suggesting possible inefficiencies in Level-2 handling.

#### Case 104:
- **Delayed Triage**: There was a **40-minute delay** between receiving the ticket and triaging it.
- **Delayed Assignment**: After triage, it took another **30 minutes** to assign the ticket to a Level-1 agent.
- **Investigation Delay**: The investigation did not begin until **3.5 hours** after assignment.
- **Resolution Delay**: Similar to Case 102, resolution occurred the next day, indicating potential bottlenecks in the investigation process.

#### Case 105:
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent**: This ticket was escalated after **1 hour 35 minutes** of initial investigation by Level-1.
- **Extended Escalation Handling**: After escalation, there was a **17-hour delay** before Level-2 began investigating the issue.
- **Resolution Delay**: The ticket was resolved over **36 hours later**, indicating severe inefficiencies in Level-2 processing.

### Step 3: Insights and Recommendations

#### Identified Factors Contributing to Delays:
1. **Escalations**: Tickets requiring escalation (e.g., Cases 102, 105) experienced significant delays, particularly during the transition to and handling by Level-2 agents.
2. **Delays Between Activities**: Long waiting times were observed between key activities such as triage, assignment, and investigation (e.g., Cases 102, 104, 105).
3. **Next-Day Resolutions**: Several tickets (Cases 102, 104, 105) were resolved only the following day, suggesting that work is not completed within a single shift or business day.

#### Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks:
1. **Streamline Escalation Process**:
   - Implement clear guidelines for when and how tickets should be escalated.
   - Ensure Level-2 agents are promptly notified and prepared to handle escalated tickets without delays.

2. **Reduce Waiting Times Between Activities**:
   - Introduce service-level agreements (SLAs) for each step in the process (e.g., triage within 15 minutes, assignment within 30 minutes, investigation within 1 hour).
   - Use automated notifications to alert responsible agents when their action is required.

3. **Improve Resource Allocation**:
   - Increase staffing levels for both Level-1 and Level-2 agents to reduce workload and prevent backlogs.
   - Consider implementing a priority queue system to ensure urgent tickets are addressed first.

4. **Enhance Collaboration Between Teams**:
   - Facilitate better communication and handoff processes between Level-1 and Level-2 teams to minimize delays during escalations.
   - Provide cross-training for agents to handle a broader range of issues, reducing the need for escalations.

5. **Monitor and Optimize Workflow**:
   - Regularly analyze performance metrics (e.g., average resolution time, escalation rate) to identify recurring bottlenecks.
   - Use workflow management tools to track ticket progress in real-time and flag delays automatically.

### Conclusion
The primary factors causing delays in ticket resolution are **escalations**, **long waiting times between activities**, and **next-day resolutions**. By addressing these issues through streamlined processes, improved resource allocation, and enhanced collaboration, the overall efficiency of the customer support ticket resolution process can be significantly improved.

**Final Answer:**
- **Cases with significantly longer resolution times**: **102, 104, 105**.
- **Root causes**: Escalations, delays between activities, and next-day resolutions.
- **Recommendations**: Streamline escalations, reduce waiting times, improve resource allocation, enhance team collaboration, and monitor workflows.
