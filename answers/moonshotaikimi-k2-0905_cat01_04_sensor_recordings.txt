Phase-based interpretation of the 15-second log (08:00:00 – 08:01:10)

--------------------------------------------------
1. Idle / Pre-start (Events 1-3)  
   All readings flat, energy  0.5 kWh  
    Machine powered but not working – classic waiting state between jobs.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Cutting Metal (Events 4-6)  
   – Temperature jumps 20  55 °C (frictional heating)  
   – Vibration 30–38 Hz (cutter engaged)  
   – Tool moving 5  10 mm  
   – Energy 2  3 kWh in 10 s  
    Exactly matches a rough-cutting phase: high instantaneous power, heat and chatter, material flow shows chips being removed.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Fine Feed / Positioning (Events 7-8)  
   – Temperature already falling (58  40 °C)  
   – Pressure now 2 bar (hydraulic axis clamp)  
   – Vibration drops (10 Hz – bearing/axis noise only)  
   – Tool creeps to final depth 15 mm  
   – Energy steady 2 kWh (servo motors, no cutting load)  
    Secondary motion to reach exact position before the next non-cutting operation.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Welding (Events 9)  
   – Temperature surges to 80 °C (arc/plasma heat)  
   – Vibration spikes 50 Hz (electromagnetic hammer, gas flow)  
   – Material flow zero (no chips)  
   – Energy peaks 5 kWh (welding transformer/robot power)  
   – Tool position frozen at 15 mm (torch stationary)  
    Classic on-the-spot fusion phase.

--------------------------------------------------
5. Cooling / Cleaning (Events 10)  
   – Sudden drop in temperature & energy (1 kWh)  
   – Vibration almost nil  
    Coolant/air-knife cycle immediately after weld.

--------------------------------------------------
6. Assembling / Light Parts Handling (Events 11-12)  
   – Low stable temperature 25 °C  
   – Vibration 5 Hz (belt/robot arm)  
   – Material flow 1 unit/s (small parts feeding)  
   – Tool moves 15  20 mm (pick-up/placement travel)  
   – Gentle energy load ~1.5 kWh  
    Fits mechanical assembly or part transfer step.

--------------------------------------------------
7. Idle / Post-job (Events 13-15)  
   Readings return to initial baseline – machine ready for next cycle.

--------------------------------------------------
Summary labels

Events 1-3Idle / Stand-by  
Events 4-6Cutting Metal(high temp, vibration, power, tool advance)  
Events 7-8Fine Positioning(lowered vibration, no material cut, tool creep)  
Events 9Welding(temperature & energy spike, stationary position)  
Events 10 Cooling / Cleaning (rapid cool-down)  
Events 11-12 Assembling Parts (gentle handling, low vibration, part flow)  
Events 13-15 Idle / Stand-by (machine returns to baseline)
