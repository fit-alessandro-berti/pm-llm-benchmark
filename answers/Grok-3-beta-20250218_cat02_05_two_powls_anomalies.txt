Let’s analyze the two POWL models of the Hire-to-Retire process step-by-step, comparing them to a standard sequence of activities while identifying anomalies and determining which model better aligns with a normative workflow.
Standard Hire-to-Retire Process
A typical Hire-to-Retire process follows this logical sequence:
Post_Job_Ad: Advertise the job opening.
Screen_Candidates: Review applications to shortlist candidates.
Conduct_Interviews: Interview the shortlisted candidates.
Make_Hiring_Decision: Decide on the candidate to hire.
Onboard_Employee: Complete onboarding for the selected employee.
Add_to_Payroll: Add the employee to the payroll system.
Close_Case: Finalize the hiring process.
This sequence reflects a logical progression: screening happens after job posting, interviews follow screening, a decision is made based on interviews, onboarding follows the decision, payroll addition follows onboarding, and the case is closed last. Deviations from this order or the introduction of unexpected control-flow structures (e.g., loops, choices) could indicate anomalies.
Step 1: Analyze POWL Model 1
Model Description
Nodes: Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close
Order:
Post → Screen
Screen → Decide
Screen → Interview
Decide → Onboard
Onboard → Payroll
Payroll → Close
Process Flow
The process starts with Post_Job_Ad.
Screen_Candidates follows Post and precedes both Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision.
Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision are partially ordered after Screen, meaning they can occur in any order relative to each other (or in parallel) as no direct precedence exists between them.
Onboard_Employee follows Decide.
Add_to_Payroll follows Onboard.
Close_Case follows Payroll.
Anomalies
Interviews and Decision Out of Order:
In a standard process, interviews precede the hiring decision because the decision relies on interview outcomes. In Model 1, Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision can occur in any order after Screen, including Decide happening before Interview. This is a severe anomaly: deciding to hire someone before interviewing them violates the logical dependency between these activities.
No Explicit Constraints on Parallelism:
Since Decide and Interview are only constrained by Screen, they could theoretically execute in parallel. While parallelism isn’t inherently wrong, it’s impractical here—making a hiring decision concurrently with interviews undermines the decision-making process.
Step 2: Analyze POWL Model 2
Model Description
Nodes: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding (Loop: Onboard, skip), xor_payroll (XOR: Payroll, skip), Close
Order:
Post → Screen
Post → Interview
Interview → Decide
Decide → loop_onboarding
loop_onboarding → xor_payroll
xor_payroll → Close
Process Flow
The process starts with Post_Job_Ad.
Screen_Candidates and Conduct_Interviews both follow Post and can occur in any order (or in parallel) as they are only constrained by Post.
Make_Hiring_Decision follows Interview.
loop_onboarding: After Decide, the process enters a loop with Onboard_Employee and a silent skip transition. This means onboarding can be repeated multiple times (execute Onboard, then either exit or repeat Onboard).
xor_payroll: After exiting the loop, there’s an exclusive choice (XOR) between Add_to_Payroll and skipping it entirely.
Close_Case follows the XOR choice.
Anomalies
Screening and Interviews Out of Order:
Screen_Candidates and Conduct_Interviews can occur in any order after Post because they both depend only on Post. In a standard process, screening precedes interviews to shortlist candidates. Allowing interviews before screening is a moderate anomaly—it’s not impossible (e.g., if candidates are directly recommended), but it deviates from typical practice where screening filters candidates for interviews.
Loop on Onboarding:
The loop structure allows Onboard_Employee to repeat multiple times after Decide. In a standard Hire-to-Retire process, onboarding occurs once per hire. Repeating onboarding could represent a rare edge case (e.g., fixing onboarding errors), but it’s not normative and introduces unnecessary complexity. This is a mild anomaly.
Optional Payroll Addition:
The XOR operator allows the process to either execute Add_to_Payroll or skip it entirely. In a standard process, adding an employee to payroll is mandatory after onboarding (assuming a paid position). Skipping payroll is a severe anomaly—it suggests an employee could be hired and onboarded without being paid, which fundamentally violates the process’s purpose.
Step 3: Comparison and Decision
Alignment with Normative Process
Model 1:
Strengths: Maintains a mostly linear flow from Post → Screen → Onboard → Payroll → Close. Payroll is mandatory, and closure follows payroll, aligning with standard expectations.
Weaknesses: The severe anomaly of allowing Make_Hiring_Decision before Conduct_Interviews disrupts the core logic of hiring, as decisions should be informed by interviews.
Model 2:
Strengths: Ensures Conduct_Interviews precedes Make_Hiring_Decision, preserving a key logical dependency.
Weaknesses: Introduces deviations like screening after interviews (moderate), looping onboarding (mild), and optional payroll (severe). The payroll skip undermines the process’s integrity more than Model 1’s decision-interview issue because payroll is a critical outcome of hiring.
Identified Anomalies
Model 1:
Severe: Decide before Interview.
Mild: Potential parallelism between Decide and Interview (less impactful).
Model 2:
Severe: Optional Payroll (XOR).
Moderate: Screen and Interview out of order.
Mild: Loop on Onboard.
Which Model is Closer to Normative?
Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process. Here’s the justification:
Severity of Anomalies: Model 1’s primary anomaly (Decide before Interview) is severe but affects an intermediate step. It could be mitigated in practice (e.g., by adding a constraint) without altering the process’s outcome. Model 2’s optional payroll is a terminal anomaly—it allows the process to complete without a critical step, undermining the purpose of hiring (to employ and pay someone).
Process Integrity: Model 1 ensures all mandatory steps (Screen, Onboard, Payroll, Close) occur in a reasonable sequence after the Decide-Interview issue. Model 2 sacrifices integrity with the payroll skip and adds unnecessary complexity with the onboarding loop.
Practicality: Model 1’s flaw is less likely to occur in a real-world execution (decisions without interviews are rare), while Model 2’s payroll skip and onboarding loop could lead to inconsistent or incomplete outcomes.
Conclusion
While neither model is perfect, Model 1 better preserves the correctness and integrity of the Hire-to-Retire process. Its anomaly, though severe, is less disruptive to the overall process outcome than Model 2’s payroll omission and additional deviations. To make Model 1 normative, one could simply add an edge from Interview to Decide, whereas Model 2 requires removing the XOR and loop operators—more significant structural changes.
