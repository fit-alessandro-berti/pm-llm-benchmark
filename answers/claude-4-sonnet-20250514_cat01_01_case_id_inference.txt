Looking at this complex interleaved sequence, I can identify three distinct cases based on the patient demographics (age and gender) and the logical flow of activities. Let me analyze the patterns:

## Case Groupings:

### **Case A: 45-year-old Male (ER visit for leg injury)**
- Event 1: Register patient (08:05:13) - ER, private insurance
- Event 4: Initial triage (08:10:50) - triage_code=3
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (08:15:42) - left_leg
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (08:23:10) - diagnosis=hairline_fracture
- Event 15: Patient discharged (08:30:05) - followup=outpatient_clinic

### **Case B: 62-year-old Female (ER visit for infection)**
- Event 2: Register patient (08:07:02) - ER, public insurance
- Event 5: Initial triage (08:12:29) - triage_code=2
- Event 8: Lab test requested (08:16:10) - blood_panel
- Event 10: Lab test completed (08:20:27) - results=normal_levels
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (08:22:54) - diagnosis=minor_infection
- Event 14: Prescription created (08:27:00) - antibiotics
- Event 17: Patient discharged (08:35:29) - followup=pharmacy_pickup

### **Case C: 28-year-old Male (Scheduled knee surgery)**
- Event 3: Register patient (08:07:15) - Surgery department, private insurance
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (08:13:00) - scheduled_knee_surgery
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (08:16:45) - general_anesthesia
- Event 13: Surgery performed (08:25:19) - arthroscopy
- Event 16: Recovery room (08:31:37) - condition=stable
- Event 18: Patient discharged (08:40:13) - followup=physiotherapy_sessions

## Key Distinguishing Factors:

1. **Patient Demographics**: Each case has unique age/gender combinations
2. **Department Flow**: Cases A & B follow ER pathways, Case C follows surgical pathway
3. **Activity Sequences**: Each follows logical medical progressions
4. **Timing Consistency**: Events within each case follow reasonable temporal sequences
5. **Clinical Coherence**: Diagnoses, treatments, and follow-ups align within each case

The interleaving occurs because all three patients were being treated simultaneously in different departments of the hospital, which is typical in a busy medical facility.
