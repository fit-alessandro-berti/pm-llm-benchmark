The visualization is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram that maps an endtoend **customer order fulfillment process** across four departments:

### 1. Sales lane (top)
- Starts with a **timer start event** (“Monday morning”).
- A **subprocess “Check customer’s order”**:
  - Check the order for completeness.
  - Decision: is the customer already in the database?
    - If not, add the customer to the **customer database** (data store).
    - If yes, continue directly.
- After the order is validated, Sales **sends the order details** (message) to:
  - Production
  - Procurement
- Sales then waits for a **message “Product sent”** from the Warehouse.
- When that message arrives, Sales **drafts the invoice** and the Sales process ends.

### 2. Production lane
- Triggered by a **message start event “Order details arrive”** from Sales.
- **Plan production**.
- An eventbased decision point waits for Procurement’s response:
  - When Procurement confirms via message that **materials are not faulty**, Production proceeds to:
    - **Manufacture product**.
    - On completion, sends a **message “Product complete”** to the Warehouse.
  - (There is also a path for order cancellation, linked from Procurement.)

### 3. Procurement lane
- Also starts with a **message start “Order details arrive”** from Sales.
- Runs a **“Material Compensation Subprocess”**:
  - **Order materials**.
  - Handle potential **material returns** (loop/linked event inside the subprocess).
- After receiving materials, **check materials**:
  - If materials are acceptable, send a **message “Material not faulty”** to Production.
  - If there is a problem leading to an order stop, issue an **“Order cancellation”** message back to Production (and possibly Sales).

### 4. Warehouse lane (bottom)
- Waits for a **message “Product complete”** from Production.
- Once received, **send product** to the customer.
- This activity throws a **message “Product sent”** to Sales, which triggers invoicing.

### Overall structure
- Four horizontal **swimlanes** represent organizational units (Sales, Production, Procurement, Warehouse).
- **Solid arrows** show the internal sequence of activities.
- **Dashed arrows** show **message flows** between departments.
- **Gateways** represent decisions and waiting for external events.
- **Subprocesses** encapsulate more detailed activities (customer order checking, material compensation).

In summary, the visualization shows how a customer order is checked, materials procured, the product manufactured, shipped, and finally invoiced, with all interdepartment communications made explicit.
