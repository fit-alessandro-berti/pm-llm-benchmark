## Process and Data Considerations for Performance Issues

Based on the information provided, the following process and data considerations might be contributing to the performance issues:

**Transport Document -> Book Vehicles:**

* **Frequency:** Both events happen frequently (594 events for Transport Document and 594 events for Book Vehicles).
* **Duration:** Book Vehicles has a longer duration (22207.07) compared to Transport Document (329005.22).
* **Object Type:** Both events involve the same object type (Transport Document).

**Possible causes:**

* **Complex business logic:** The process might involve complex calculations or approvals which could lead to delays in Book Vehicles.
* **Data processing:** Large amounts of data might be involved in Book Vehicles, causing delays in processing and transferring information.

**Book Vehicles -> Reschedule Container:**

* **Frequency:** Frequent event with a relatively high frequency (19 events).
* **Duration:** Relatively long duration (371476.42).
* **Object Type:** Different object type (Container).

**Possible causes:**

* **Complex business logic:** Rescheduling containers might involve complex calculations, approvals, or resource allocation, leading to delays.
* **Data processing:** Large amounts of data might be involved in the reschedule process, causing delays in processing and transferring information.
* **Concurrency issues:** Frequent rescheduling of containers might lead to bottlenecks and slowdowns in the overall process.

**Book Vehicles -> Load to Vehicle:**

* **Frequency:** Frequent event with a relatively high frequency (12 events).
* **Duration:** Relatively long duration (22237.92).
* **Object Type:** Different object type (Vehicle).

**Possible causes:**

* **Complex business logic:** Booking vehicles might involve complex calculations, approvals, or resource allocation, leading to delays.
* **Data processing:** Large amounts of data might be involved in the booking process, causing delays in processing and transferring information.
* **Concurrency issues:** Frequent booking of vehicles might lead to bottlenecks and slowdowns in the overall process.

**Other observations:**

* **Forklift:** Weighing and placing objects takes longer than loading them onto vehicles.
* **Customer Order:** Registering customer orders takes a significant amount of time (329005.22).
* **Transport Document:** Departing events happen relatively frequently but still take a long duration (1007066.16).

**Overall, the performance issues seem to stem from the frequency and duration of events, particularly for Book Vehicles and Reschedule Container activities. The specific cause might lie within the business logic, data processing, or concurrency issues.**
