### 1. Normative Rule Violations

**Case 1: No violations.**  
This case adheres perfectly to the strict sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. All ordering rules are satisfied, with no skips, reversals, or contradictory actions.

**Case 2: Two normative violations.**  
- **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check** (2024-01-11 08:20 Risk Assessment, followed by 09:00 Credit Check). This reverses the required order (Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment).  
- **Finalize Documentation after Loan Rejection** (2024-01-11 09:30 Loan Decision (Rejected), followed by 10:00 Finalize Documentation). This is explicitly not allowed for rejected loans.  
The case also skips proper sequencing by advancing to Risk Assessment and Loan Decision without prior Credit Check completion, and closes the case after the invalid documentation step.

**Case 3: No normative violations.**  
The sequence follows the rules: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. No skips, reversals, or contradictions (documentation is appropriately finalized post-approval before closing).

### 2. Desiderata Failures (Suboptimal but Not Severe)

**Case 1: No desiderata failures.**  
Credit Check occurred ~30 minutes after application (well within 24 hours). Inform Applicant was ~2 hours after decision (well within 48 hours). A Follow-up Call is not logged but not required.

**Case 2: No desiderata assessment possible.**  
Due to normative violations (e.g., sequencing errors and invalid documentation), desiderata like timing windows or Follow-up Call cannot be meaningfully evaluated. The process was fundamentally flawed.

**Case 3: Three desiderata failures (suboptimal delays and omission).**  
- **Credit Check delayed beyond 24-hour preference**: Occurred ~49 hours after Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00).  
- **Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48-hour preference**: Occurred ~75 hours after Loan Decision (2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00).  
- **No Follow-up Call performed** before Close Case.  
These represent recommended best practices not followed, leading to suboptimal efficiency and customer experience, but they do not breach strict rules.

### 3. Suggested Interpretations or Justifications

**Case 1:** Ideal compliant behavior; no need for justification. Could represent a high-priority or automated fast-track application.

**Case 2:**  
- The premature Risk Assessment before Credit Check might be justified as an "initial preliminary review" misinterpreted in logging, or due to system error/parallel processing in a high-volume environment, with Credit Check retroactively completed. However, this does not excuse the order reversal under strict rules.  
- Finalize Documentation post-rejection could be interpreted as preparing "rejection paperwork" or administrative closure docs, but this contradicts the explicit rule against it for rejections. Likely a procedural error by staff assuming uniform documentation regardless of outcome.

**Case 3:**  
- Delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant could be justified by external factors like holidays/weekends (e.g., 2024-01-12 to 2024-01-14 spans potential non-business days), resource constraints, or applicant-requested pauses, aligning with real-world variability while still meeting sequence rules.  
- Omission of Follow-up Call might reflect a low-risk approved case where alignment was confirmed via Inform Applicant step, or it was performed but not logged—acceptable as non-mandatory. Overall, this case shows compliance under challenging timelines.
