### Key Constraints Explained:
1. **Existence**: Mandatory activities (e.g., `Idea Generation`, `Final Launch`).
2. **Init**: The process must start with `Idea Generation`.
3. **Precedence/Response**: Ensures logical ordering (e.g., `Design Draft` before `Prototype Creation`).
4. **Succession**: Strict direct ordering (e.g., `Approval Gate`  `Marketing Plan`).
5. **Chain Constraints**: Multi-step dependencies (e.g., `Idea Generation`  `Design Draft`  `Prototype Creation`).
6. **Absence/NonCoexistence**: Not used here, but could enforce exclusions if needed.

This model ensures that the process follows a structured workflow while allowing flexibility where needed (e.g., `Laboratory Testing` and `User Testing` can occur in any order). Adjust `support` and `confidence` values based on real-world data if available.
