Based on the flowchart-like format of the data, I'll do my best to describe the process:

The process appears to be a workflow for processing employee declarations. The process starts with an "Employee" entering a declaration (step 1). The employee can submit the declaration to either the "Pre-Approver", "Administration", or directly to the "Supervisor" (steps 2-4).

If the employee submits the declaration to the "Pre-Approver", it will be reviewed and either approved (step 5) or rejected (step 6) by the Pre-Approver. If rejected, the employee can resubmit the declaration to any of the earlier points in the process (steps 2-6).

If the employee submits the declaration to "Administration", it will be reviewed and either approved (step 10) or rejected (step 11) by the Administration team. If approved, the declaration will be forwarded to either the "Supervisor" or the "Budget Owner" (steps 12 and 14). If rejected, it will be returned to the employee (step 11).

If the employee submits the declaration directly to the "Supervisor", it will be reviewed and either approved (step 16) or rejected (step 17) by the Supervisor. If approved, it will be finalized (step 18). If rejected, it will be returned to the employee (step 17).

The process also includes points where the declaration can be rejected at various stages, which triggers the employee to resubmit the declaration to any of the earlier points in the process.

Additionally, there are a few special cases:

* The "Payment Handled" step can occur after a declaration has been finalized (step 19) or rejected (step 20).
* The "Request Payment" step can occur at the beginning of the process (step 1) or after a declaration has been rejected (step 21).
* There are several "Rejected" steps where the employee can resubmit the declaration, and a few "FOR_APPROVAL" steps that seem to be error cases or exceptions.

Overall, the process appears to be a workflow for processing employee declarations, including submission, review, and approval/rejection by various stakeholders.
