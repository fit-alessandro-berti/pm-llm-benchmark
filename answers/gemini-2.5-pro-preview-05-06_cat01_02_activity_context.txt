Okay, let's break down the event log and rename the activities to reflect their contextual differences.

**1. Identifying Activities with Contextual Differences:**

By analyzing the log, the following activities appear multiple times (either within the same case or across cases with the same generic name) but with different underlying meanings or purposes:

*   **`Verify Documents`**:
    *   In C001, it occurs first as an initial check and then again after the customer submits additional documents.
    *   In C003, it occurs first as an initial physical check and then again after an account adjustment.
*   **`Call Customer`**:
    *   In C001, it's to request missing documents.
    *   In C002, the first call is to clarify a discrepancy, and the second is to confirm an adjustment.
    *   In C003, it's to ask a customer who stepped out to return.
*   **`Initiate Request`**: While it doesn't repeat within a single case, its context (online vs. in-branch) is different and can be clarified in the name.
*   **`Adjust Account`**: Similarly, this doesn't repeat within a case, but the reason for adjustment differs (post-clarification vs. data correction) and can be made more specific.

**2. Renaming Activities:**

Based on the context, here are the proposed new names:

*   **`Initiate Request`**:
    *   `Initiate Request - Online` (when via WebPortal)
    *   `Initiate Request - In-Branch` (when via BranchReception)
*   **`Verify Documents`**:
    *   Initial verifications: `Verify Documents - Initial`
    *   Re-verification after new documents: `Verify Documents - Re-check (New Info)`
    *   Re-verification after account adjustment: `Verify Documents - Re-check (Post-Adjustment)`
*   **`Call Customer`**:
    *   Call to request missing documents: `Call Customer - Request Missing Docs`
    *   Call to clarify a discrepancy: `Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy`
    *   Call to confirm adjustments: `Call Customer - Confirm Adjustment`
    *   Call to request customer return: `Call Customer - Request Return to Branch`
*   **`Adjust Account`**:
    *   Adjustment after clarification call: `Adjust Account - Post-Clarification`
    *   Adjustment due to missing information/correction: `Adjust Account - Data Correction`

Activities like `Submit Additional` and `Approve Request` have a consistent meaning in their occurrences and do not require renaming for disambiguation based on this log.

**3. Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities:**

**4. Justification for Naming Choices:**

*   **Initiate Request:**
    *   Renamed to `Initiate Request - Online` and `Initiate Request - In-Branch`.
    *   **Justification:** The original name was generic. The `Resource` column (WebPortal vs. BranchReception) and `Additional Context` indicated different initiation channels, which the new names now reflect for better process understanding.

*   **Verify Documents:**
    *   Renamed to `Verify Documents - Initial`, `Verify Documents - Re-check (New Info)`, and `Verify Documents - Re-check (Post-Adjustment)`.
    *   **Justification:** This activity appeared multiple times within C001 and C003.
        *   The first instance in each case is an initial check.
        *   The second instance in C001 is a re-check specifically because "ID scan is provided" (new information).
        *   The second instance in C003 is a re-check "after account adjustment."
        The new names distinguish these crucial contextual differences.

*   **Call Customer:**
    *   Renamed to `Call Customer - Request Missing Docs`, `Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy`, `Call Customer - Confirm Adjustment`, and `Call Customer - Request Return to Branch`.
    *   **Justification:** The generic `Call Customer` activity occurred for varied reasons.
        *   In C001: "request missing docs."
        *   In C002 (first call): "clarify account discrepancy."
        *   In C002 (second call): "confirm adjustments made."
        *   In C003: "calls to have them return."
        The new names specify the purpose of each call, which is critical for understanding the workflow.

*   **Adjust Account:**
    *   Renamed to `Adjust Account - Post-Clarification` and `Adjust Account - Data Correction`.
    *   **Justification:** The reason for account adjustment varied.
        *   In C002: "Adjust account details internally after call" (the call was to clarify a discrepancy).
        *   In C003: "Internal correction due to missing info."
        The new names highlight these distinct triggers for the adjustment.

By renaming these activities, the event log becomes much more descriptive, allowing for a clearer understanding of the process flow and the specific actions being taken at each step.
