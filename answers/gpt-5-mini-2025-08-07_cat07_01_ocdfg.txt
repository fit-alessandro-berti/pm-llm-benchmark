This is a processmap (processmining style) visualization of several procurement/order/payment flows. It shows different start points (top) for five object types, the main activities in the middle, how those activities connect, the object volumes at each node, and average transition times on the arrows.

Key elements you can read from the chart
- Start nodes (ovals) at the top for different item types with counts:
  - PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M), SalesOrderItem (3.5M), PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M), VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M), ReturnOrderItem (0.8M).
- Activity boxes (rounded rectangles) with overall object totals, for example:
  - Create Requisition — Overall: 3.0M
  - Approve Requisition — Overall: 5.7M
  - Create Order — Overall: 8.5M
  - Pack Goods — Overall: 2.0M
  - Ship Goods — Overall: 1.8M
  - Confirm Delivery — Overall: 1.7M
  - Close Order — Overall: 1.7M
  - Send Order — Overall: 5.2M
  - Check Stock — Overall: 1.0M
  - Process Return — Overall: 0.8M
  - Approve Payment — Overall: 1.5M
  - Create Invoice — Overall: 2.0M
- Colored dots on nodes and colored arrows indicate which source/item type is following which path (multiple colored incoming/outgoing lines to show branching and merges).
- Edge labels are latencies (ms) representing average time between steps (examples: 300ms from PurchaseRequisitionItem start to Create Requisition, 400ms from Create Order to Pack Goods, 200ms from Pack Goods to Ship Goods, 100–800ms on other transitions).
- End nodes (ovals) at the bottom show where each path terminates.

Process structure (high level)
- Left/middle: requisition/invoice/stock-related flow — Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  (Check Stock / Send Order / Process Return / Approve Payment)  Create Invoice  End.
- Right: order fulfillment flow — Create Order  Pack Goods  Ship Goods  Confirm Delivery  Close Order  End.
- Return and vendor invoice flows feed into Approve Requisition, Process Return, Approve Payment and Create Invoice as appropriate.
- Many arrows show consolidation and branching points, indicating parallel or alternate paths and handoffs between procurement and fulfillment processes.

Overall impression
- This is a consolidated view of order-to-cash and procure-to-pay processes with volumes and performance (transition times), useful for spotting hotspots (high volumes or long transition times) and understanding how different item types move through the process.
