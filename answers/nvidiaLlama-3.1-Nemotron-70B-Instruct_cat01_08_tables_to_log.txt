**Assumptions and Notes:**

1. **Resource/Actor Identification**: For some activities (e.g., payment receipt), specific actors within the organization could not be identified directly from the provided tables, so the "Resource/Actor" column includes relevant information available (e.g., payment reference numbers).

2. **Activity Granularity**: Each "Item Picked" event corresponds to a specific item being picked for an order. If multiple items of the same type were picked at once, this is reflected in the quantity attribute of that single event to maintain a clear and concise log.

3. **Chronological Order**: Events for each case (order) are ordered chronologically based on the provided timestamps, ensuring the sequence of events logically flows from order creation to completion.

4. **Attribute Inclusion**: Additional attributes included in the "Other Attributes" column aim to provide context to each event, making the log more informative for process mining purposes.
