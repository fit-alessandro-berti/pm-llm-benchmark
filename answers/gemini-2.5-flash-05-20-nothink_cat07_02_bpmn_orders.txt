This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating a multi-department order fulfillment process. It is divided into four distinct pools, each representing a department or area of responsibility: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

Here's a breakdown of the process flow within each pool and the interactions between them:

**1. Sales Pool:**
*   **Start:** The process begins with "Monday morning" (indicated by a clock icon).
*   **Check Order for Completeness:** The initial task is to check if the customer's order is complete.
*   **Check if Customer is Already in the Database:** After completeness, there's a decision point (exclusive gateway) to determine if the customer exists in the database.
    *   **Customer not in the database:** If the customer is new, the process moves to "Add customer to the database." This task has a data object labeled "database" associated with it, indicating data interaction.
    *   **Customer in the database:** If the customer already exists, this step is skipped.
*   **Check Customer's Order:** This task appears to be a general check of the customer's order, potentially after the database interaction.
*   **Send Order Details:** Once the customer and order are validated, "Send order details" is performed. This task triggers messages (dashed lines with open circles) to the "Production" and "Procurement" pools, indicating that order details are passed on.
*   **Product Sent (Intermediate Event):** An intermediate event marks the point when the product is sent from the Warehouse.
*   **Draft Invoice:** Following the product being sent, an invoice is drafted.
*   **End:** The Sales process concludes.

**2. Production Pool:**
*   **Start (Message Event):** The Production process begins when "Order details arrive" (triggered by Sales).
*   **Plan Production:** The first task is to plan the production.
*   **Exclusive Gateway:** After planning, there's a decision point.
    *   **Material not faulty:** If materials are not faulty, the process proceeds to "Manufacture product."
    *   **Default Flow (No Material Faulty):** The diagram indicates a direct flow from "Plan Production" to "Manufacture product" as the main path.
*   **Manufacture Product:** The product is manufactured.
*   **Product Complete (Intermediate Event):** This intermediate event signifies that the product manufacturing is finished. A message (dashed line with an open circle) is sent to the "Warehouse" pool, indicating "Product complete."

**3. Procurement Pool:**
*   **Start (Message Event):** The Procurement process begins when "Order details arrive" (triggered by Sales).
*   **Material Compensation Subprocess:** This pool contains an embedded subprocess.
    *   **Order Materials:** Inside the subprocess, the initial task is to "Order materials."
    *   **Return Material (Intermediate Event):** This is an intermediate event for returning materials (indicated by a double arrow icon). There's a dotted line to "Order Materials," suggesting a potential loop or re-ordering if materials need to be returned.
    *   **Check Materials:** After ordering, materials are checked.
    *   **Exclusive Gateway (Looping):** If materials are faulty (implied by the loop-back arrow to "Return material"), they might be returned. If materials are satisfactory, the subprocess ends.
    *   **Order Cancellation (Intermediate Event):** There is an event labeled "Order cancellation" which has an activity "check materials" preceding it. The diagram shows it is an exclusive gateway leading to an end event. This suggests that if the materials are checked and found to be faulty, it can lead to an order cancellation.
*   **End:** The Procurement process concludes.

**4. Warehouse Pool:**
*   **Start (Message Event):** The Warehouse process begins when "Product complete" (triggered by Production).
*   **Send Product:** The task is to "Send product."
*   **Product Sent (Intermediate Event):** This intermediate event signifies the product has been sent. A message (dashed line with an open circle) is sent back to the "Sales" pool to confirm "Product sent."
*   **End:** The Warehouse process concludes.

**Overall Flow and Interactions:**

The diagram illustrates a linear progression from sales order initiation through production and procurement, culminating in product delivery and invoicing. Key interactions are:
*   Sales initiates production and procurement.
*   Production notifies Warehouse upon product completion.
*   Warehouse notifies Sales upon product shipment.
*   Procurement handles material ordering and checking, with a potential loop for returns or cancellation based on material quality.

The use of message flows (dashed lines with open circles) clearly depicts the asynchronous communication and hand-offs between different departments, while gateways manage the flow logic, such as customer existence checks and material fault handling.
