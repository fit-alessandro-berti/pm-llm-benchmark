1. case:citizen - This indicates citizenship status, which could lead to discrimination if used inappropriately in decision-making processes.

2. case:gender - Gender is a protected characteristic in many jurisdictions and using it could result in unfair treatment.

3. case:german speaking - Language ability, especially related to a specific language, could be a proxy for national origin or ethnicity, which are protected characteristics.

4. case:private_insurance - Insurance status could be an indicator of socioeconomic status, and using this information might lead to unfair treatment of individuals based on their economic situation.

5. case:underlying_condition - This could relate to disability or health status, which are often protected characteristics and should be handled carefully to avoid discrimination.

These attributes are considered sensitive because they relate to personal characteristics that are often protected by anti-discrimination laws and ethical guidelines. Using these attributes in decision-making processes without careful consideration could lead to unfair treatment or discrimination against certain groups of people.

It's important to note that while these attributes may be valuable for understanding the patient population and potentially for providing appropriate care, they should be used cautiously in any automated decision-making systems or processes that could affect patient outcomes or treatment paths.
