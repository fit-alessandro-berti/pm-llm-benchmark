## Step 1: Identify Cases with Longer Durations
To identify which cases are taking significantly longer to complete, we first need to calculate the duration of each case. This can be done by subtracting the timestamp of the "Submit Claim" event from the timestamp of the "Close Claim" event for each case.

## Step 2: Calculate Case Durations
Based on the event log, we calculate the duration for each case. This step involves data manipulation and calculation, which would typically be done using software such as Excel or Python with pandas. For simplicity, let's list the results directly:
- Case 2001: 1.5 hours
- Case 2002: 2 days (48 hours)
- Case 2003: 2 days (48 hours)
- Case 2004: 1.25 hours
- Case 2005: 3 days (72 hours)

## Step 3: Identify Cases with Performance Issues
Based on the durations calculated, we can see that Cases 2002, 2003, and 2005 are significantly longer than the others. These cases have durations in days rather than hours, indicating potential performance issues.

## Step 4: Analyze Attributes for Root Causes
Now, we analyze the attributes of these cases to identify potential root causes of the extended durations:
- **Resource**: While the resources involved vary, there doesn't seem to be a pattern that directly links one resource to longer durations across multiple cases.
- **Region**: Cases in both regions (A and B) are represented among those with performance issues, suggesting that region may not be the primary cause.
- **Complexity**: Cases 2003 and 2005 are marked as "High" complexity, and they both involve multiple requests for additional documents, significantly extending their duration.

## Step 5: Propose Explanations and Solutions
Based on the analysis, high complexity claims seem to be a significant factor in extended case durations, particularly due to the need for multiple requests for additional documents. This suggests that:
- **Complexity Handling**: Improving the process for handling high complexity claims could mitigate these issues. This might involve specialized teams for complex claims, or more efficient documentation gathering processes.
- **Resource Allocation**: Though resources don't seem to be a direct cause, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to handle the increased time required for complex claims might help.
- **Training and Efficiency**: Training and process improvements to minimize the need for multiple requests for additional documents could significantly reduce durations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$
