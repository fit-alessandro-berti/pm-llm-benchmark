## Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors Observed:

Given the normal process flow and the sample logs, the following anomalies are evident:

### 1. Process Steps Out of Sequence
- **Case 1002**: "Confirm Shipment" and "Ship Goods" occurred before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock".
- **Case 1003**: "Ship Goods" and "Issue Invoice" occurred before "Confirm Shipment".
- **Case 1004**: "Receive Payment" occurred before "Issue Invoice" and before any shipment was confirmed or dispatched.

### 2. Missing Process Steps
- In **Case 1004**, "Validate Stock" and "Perform Credit Check" were not recorded at all.

## Hypotheses About Why These Anomalies Could Occur:

These anomalies could indicate:

1. **System Issues**:
    - System logic is loosely enforcing the order of process steps, or there are missing workflow constraints.
    - Events could get logged inaccurately due to timestamp synchronization errors.
  
2. **Policy Violations**:
    - Employees or managers violating standard procedures to expedite orders, especially in priority cases or special circumstances.

3. **Training and Communication Gaps**:
    - Staff may not be adequately trained, leading to misinterpreting or bypassing correct procedures.
    - Confusion or ambiguity in procedural documentation causing inconsistent adherence.

4. **Fraudulent or Malicious Activities**:
    - Receiving payments prior to invoice generation and shipment might indicate intentional policy violation or fraudulent activity.

## Recommended SQL Queries to Investigate Anomalies Further:

### Check for Events Occurring Out of Standard Process Order Across All Cases:

```sql
SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as actual_event_sequence
FROM
    order_event_log
ORDER BY
    case_id, timestamp;
```

Analysis:
- By assigning an actual event sequence based on timestamps, you can quickly identify anomalies across all logs. Compare this event sequence against your known standard sequence to pinpoint deviations.

---

### Identify Cases Where Critical Activities Are Completely Missing:

```sql
SELECT o.case_id
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log e ON o.case_id = e.case_id AND e.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
WHERE e.activity IS NULL;
```

```sql
SELECT o.case_id
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log e ON o.case_id = e.case_id AND e.activity = 'Validate Stock'
WHERE e.activity IS NULL;
```

Analysis:
- Quickly find orders that bypass essential steps like Credit Checks and Stock validation.

---

### Determine Any Pattern Between Anomalous Behavior and Resources / Roles:

```sql
SELECT 
    oel.activity,
    oel.resource,
    res.role,
    COUNT(*) as occurrences
FROM 
    order_event_log oel
JOIN 
    resources res 
ON 
    oel.resource = res.resource_id
WHERE 
    oel.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Receive Payment')
GROUP BY 
    oel.activity, oel.resource, res.role
ORDER BY 
    occurrences DESC;
```

Analysis:  
- This query helps identify if certain resources or roles frequently correspond to unusual execution sequences or if individual employees deviate from procedures more often.

---

### Investigate Payments Received Before Invoice or Shipment:

```sql
SELECT 
    e_payment.case_id,
    e_payment.timestamp AS payment_time,
    e_invoice.timestamp AS invoice_time,
    e_shipment.timestamp AS shipment_time
FROM 
    (SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE activity='Receive Payment') AS e_payment
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) AS timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE activity='Issue Invoice' GROUP BY case_id) AS e_invoice
ON e_payment.case_id = e_invoice.case_id
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) AS timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE activity='Ship Goods' GROUP BY case_id) AS e_shipment
ON e_payment.case_id = e_shipment.case_id
WHERE 
    (e_invoice.timestamp IS NULL OR e_payment.timestamp < e_invoice.timestamp)
    OR (e_shipment.timestamp IS NULL OR e_payment.timestamp < e_shipment.timestamp);
```

Analysis:  
- Identify explicitly where payments precede invoices or shipment. This might indicate customer negotiation, prepayments, or unauthorized adjustments.

---

### Detect Unusual Events for Priority vs Standard Orders:

```sql
SELECT
    o.order_type, oel.activity, COUNT(*) as activity_occurrences
FROM
    orders o
JOIN
    order_event_log oel ON o.case_id = oel.case_id
GROUP BY
    o.order_type, oel.activity
ORDER BY
    o.order_type, activity_occurrences;
```

Analysis:
- Different processes might be informally applied based on order priority. Confirm whether deviations correlate with priority status of orders.

---

### Assess the Frequency and Patterns of Anomalous Process Execution by Time (to detect rushed or unusual timing):

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour_interval,
    activity,
    COUNT(*) AS executions
FROM
    order_event_log
GROUP BY
    hour_interval, activity
ORDER BY
    hour_interval, executions DESC;
```

Analysis:  
- Check if anomalies cluster around certain high-pressure or understaffed time intervals, suggesting operational pressures or rushed processing.

These structured queries explore the anomalies deeper, helping understand the root causes and informing whether they arise from human, technological, procedural, or possibly even fraudulent origins.
