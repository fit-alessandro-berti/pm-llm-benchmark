### Analysis of Event Log

#### **1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Constraints)**

**Case 1:**
- **Observation:** Follows the strict sequence perfectly.
- **Conclusion:** No violations.

**Case 2:**
- **Observation:**
  - Risk Assessment was performed before Credit Check (violates the rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment).
  - Finalize Documentation was done after a rejection (violates the rule that documentation should not be finalized for rejected loans).
- **Conclusion:** This case **violates the normative rules** due to:
  - Out-of-order activities (Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
  - Incorrect finalization of documentation after rejection.

**Case 3:**
- **Observation:** Follows the strict sequence correctly.
- **Conclusion:** No violations.

#### **2. Violations of Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

**Case 1:**
- **Observation:**
  - Credit Check and Risk Assessment were completed within 1 hour of application (no timing issue).
  - Applicant was informed 2 hours after the loan decision (within recommended 48 hours).
  - No Follow-up Call was recorded (but this is optional).
- **Conclusion:** No desideratum violations.

**Case 2:**
- **Observation:**
  - Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment (violates desired order, but this is already a normative violation).
  - No Follow-up Call was recorded (but this is optional).
- **Conclusion:** Only the normative violations are severe. The lack of Follow-up Call is not a critical issue.

**Case 3:**
- **Observation:**
  - Credit Check was completed **4 days** after the application (violates the desired 24-hour window).
  - Applicant was informed **2 full days** after the loan decision (violates the desired 48-hour window).
  - No Follow-up Call was recorded (but this is optional).
- **Conclusion:** This case **fails to meet the desiderata** due to:
  - Delayed Credit Check (>24 hours).
  - Delayed Applicant Notification (>48 hours).
  - Missing Follow-up Call (though this is minor).

#### **3. Interpretations/Justifications for Observed Behaviors**

**Case 2 (Normative Violations):**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**
  - Possible justification: The credit check might have been missed or delayed due to human error, and the assessor proceeded with the risk assessment prematurely.
  - This is a **process design flaw** or **execution error** that must be addressed to ensure compliance.

- **Finalizing Documentation after Rejection:**
  - This could happen if the system automatically triggers documentation before the decision is finalized, or if the assessor misread the decision.
  - This is a **critical error** that must be fixed to prevent compliance issues.

**Case 3 (Desideratum Violations):**
- **Delayed Credit Check & Notification:**
  - Possible justification: High workload, staffing shortages, or system delays caused the credit check to take too long. The delayed notification might be due to a backlog or administrative oversight.
  - While not strictly forbidden, this **reduces efficiency and applicant satisfaction** and should be improved.

- **Missing Follow-up Call:**
  - This is a **best practice oversight** and may not always be necessary, but it could improve customer experience.

### **Final Summary of Findings**

| **Case ID** | **Normative Violations** | **Desideratum Violations** | **Remarks** |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| 1           | None                    | None                       | Fully compliant. |
| 2           | - Risk Assessment before Credit Check <br> - Finalized documentation after rejection | None (but normative violations are severe) | **Must be corrected** due to critical errors. |
| 3           | None                    | - Credit Check delayed (>24h) <br> - Applicant notification delayed (>48h) <br> - Missing Follow-up Call | **Suboptimal but not forbidden**—efficiency improvements needed. |

**Recommendations:**
- **Case 2:** Investigate why the process was violated and implement controls (e.g., automated validation checks).
- **Case 3:** Review workflow delays and consider staffing or system adjustments to meet timing expectations.
- **General:** Ensure follow-up calls are logged if feasible, but this is optional.
