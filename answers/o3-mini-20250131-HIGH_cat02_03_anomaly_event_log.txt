Below is an analysis of the event log with a focus on sequences that deviate from the expected Procure-to-Pay (P2P) flow and why these deviations are concerning:

---

### **Standard P2P Flow Recap**

A well-controlled P2P process typically follows these steps in order:
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. **Receive Vendor Invoice**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

This order ensures that purchases are properly vetted, authorized, and verified before any funds are disbursed.

### **Case-by-Case Analysis**

#### **Case 1001: Normal Flow**
- **Sequence:**
  1. Create Purchase Requisition
  2. Approve Purchase Requisition
  3. Issue Purchase Order
  4. Receive Goods
  5. Vendor Invoice Received
  6. Match Invoice to PO
  7. Release Payment
  8. Close Case
  
- **Comment:**  
  The events in Case 1001 follow the expected order, with approval and documentation in place before ordering, goods receipt, and payment. No immediate red flags are present.

#### **Case 1002: Out-of-Sequence Approval and Payment**
- **Sequence:**
  1. Create Purchase Requisition (08:30)
  2. **Issue Purchase Order (08:40)**
  3. Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-03 07:00)
  4. **Release Payment (2024-02-03 07:15)**
  5. **Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-03 08:00)**
  6. Receive Goods (2024-02-04 09:00)
  7. Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-05 08:00)
  8. Close Case (2024-02-06 16:00)
  
- **Anomalies:**
  - **Approval Occurring Too Late:**  
    The Purchase Requisition is approved *after* issuing the PO, receiving the vendor invoice, and even releasing payment. In a standard process, the approval should come immediately after creation to ensure that the purchase is properly vetted.
  
  - **Premature Payment:**  
    Payment is released before the goods are received. This can result in funds being disbursed without the proper verification that the ordered items have been delivered.
  
- **Potential Problems:**  
  - **Risk of Unauthorized Purchases:** Issuing a PO before formal approval means that the purchase might not have undergone proper scrutiny.
  - **Control Weaknesses:** Releasing payment without confirming receipt of goods increases the risk of paying for undelivered or incorrect items.

#### **Case 1003: Payment Released Before Invoice and Receipt**
- **Sequence:**
  1. Create Purchase Requisition (09:00)
  2. Approve Purchase Requisition (09:10)
  3. Issue Purchase Order (10:00)
  4. **Release Payment (2024-02-08 11:00)**
  5. **Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-09 12:00)**
  6. **Receive Goods (2024-02-10 13:00)**
  7. Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-11 14:00)
  8. Close Case (2024-02-12 10:00)
  
- **Anomaly:**
  - **Premature Payment:**  
    Payment is released before the vendor invoice is received and before the goods are delivered. Typically, payment is one of the final steps, only occurring after proper verification of both the invoice and the delivery.
  
- **Potential Problems:**  
  - **Financial Risk:** Releasing funds without verifying the actual receipt of goods or correctness of the invoice can lead to overpayments or payment for non-delivered goods.
  - **Audit and Compliance Issues:** This reversal of the standard sequence undermines internal controls and can expose the organization to fraud or errors.

#### **Case 1004: Goods Received Before PO Issuance**
- **Sequence:**
  1. Create Purchase Requisition (10:00)
  2. Approve Purchase Requisition (10:15)
  3. **Receive Goods (2024-02-06 09:00)**
  4. **Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-06 09:15)**
  5. Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-07 08:00)
  6. Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-07 08:30)
  7. Release Payment (2024-02-07 09:00)
  8. Close Case (2024-02-08 11:00)
  
- **Anomaly:**
  - **PO Issued After Goods Receipt:**  
    Receiving goods before the PO is issued is contrary to best practices. The PO should serve as a formal confirmation of what is being ordered and is used later to match with the invoice and goods received.
  
- **Potential Problems:**  
  - **Verification Issues:** Without a PO in place at the time of goods receipt, there may be discrepancies between what was ordered and what was delivered.
  - **Risk of Unauthorized Deliveries:** Receiving goods without a prior PO could lead to deliveries that have not been properly authorized, increasing the risk of errors or fraud.

### **Summary**

- **Case 1001:** Follows the standard, expected process.
- **Case 1002:**  
  - **Issue:** Approval comes after issuing the PO and releasing payment, and payment is made before goods are received.
  - **Why It’s Problematic:** It undermines the control checks that ensure only properly approved and verified purchases are processed.
  
- **Case 1003:**  
  - **Issue:** Payment is released before receiving the vendor invoice and before the goods are delivered.
  - **Why It’s Problematic:** This sequence increases the risk of financial errors and potential fraud since payments are made without final verification.
  
- **Case 1004:**  
  - **Issue:** Goods are received before the PO is issued.
  - **Why It’s Problematic:** It disrupts the standard matching and verification process, making it harder to ensure that the goods received are as ordered.

### **Conclusion**

Anomalies in the sequence of activities—such as approvals and PO issuance occurring out of order, or payments being released before critical verification steps—can significantly weaken internal controls. These deviations from the standard P2P process not only increase the risk of financial loss due to errors or fraud but also make audit and compliance verification more difficult. Addressing these anomalies is essential for maintaining proper governance and ensuring that the procurement process is both efficient and secure.
