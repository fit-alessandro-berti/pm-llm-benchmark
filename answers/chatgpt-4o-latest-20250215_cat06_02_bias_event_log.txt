There are a few areas where potential bias can be observed in the event log, particularly in how scores are adjusted based on community affiliation and possibly residency status. Here’s a breakdown of how bias might be influencing the outcomes:

### **1. Community Affiliation Bias**
- Cases **C001** and **C004**, which were associated with the *Highland Civic Darts Club*, received a **+10 score adjustment** in the *Preliminary Scoring* phase.  
- Other applicants (C002, C003, C005) received **no adjustments** in this phase, despite having similar or even higher initial scores.  
- This suggests that individuals who are members of certain community groups receive a systematic advantage.  

**Implication:**  
Applicants without community affiliations may be at a disadvantage, even if their base scores are comparable. This introduces a form of **preferential treatment** for those associated with specific groups, which may not directly relate to their actual creditworthiness or eligibility.

### **2. Local Residency Bias**
- All applicants marked as **"LocalResident = TRUE"** (C001, C002, C004) were **approved**, even when their scores were lower.  
- The **two applicants marked as "LocalResident = FALSE"** (C003, C005) had different outcomes:  
  - C003 (score: 715) was **rejected**  
  - C005 (score: 740) was **approved**  
- C003’s rejection stands out because **C004 was approved with a lower adjusted score (700), likely due to community affiliation.**  

**Implication:**  
Non-local applicants might face **harsher scrutiny** or a higher threshold for approval. This could disproportionately affect people moving into the area or those who lack long-term residency ties.

### **3. Score Threshold Disparity**
- **C004 (LocalResident = TRUE, Community Affiliation) was approved with 700**  
- **C003 (LocalResident = FALSE, No Community Affiliation) was rejected with 715**  
- This suggests that **some applicants need higher scores than others to be approved**, reinforcing the advantage for local residents and affiliated community members.  

**Implication:**  
The decision-making process might not be purely merit-based and could penalize applicants based on factors **unrelated to their actual financial standing**.

---

### **4. Manual Review and Potential Subjectivity**
- Every case underwent **manual review by different reviewers**.  
- While the review outcomes mostly align with the preliminary scores, the **one rejection (C003) could suggest subjective bias**, especially since another applicant with a lower adjusted score was approved.  
- Without clear criteria for manual reviews, there’s room for **implicit bias** in the process.  

**Implication:**  
The reliance on different human reviewers introduces the risk of **inconsistent decision-making** depending on the reviewer’s perspective or unconscious biases.

### **Conclusion & Recommendations**
There’s clear evidence of **bias favoring local residents and community group members**, even when their financial profiles appear similar to (or weaker than) non-local, unaffiliated applicants.  

**Possible Fixes:**
1. **Remove Community Score Adjustments** – Ensure all applicants are judged purely on financial metrics rather than group affiliations.  
2. **Ensure Residency-Neutral Decision-Making** – If local residency is a required factor, it should be explicitly stated in the approval criteria rather than implied through scoring disparities.  
3. **Standardize Manual Review Criteria** – Reviewers should follow transparent and well-defined criteria to reduce subjective influences.  
4. **Audit Rejected Cases** – Ensure that applicants with scores above previous approval thresholds aren’t being rejected unfairly.
