#### D. Final Approval and Payment

| Activity ID | Activity Name | Performed By | Preceding Step(s) | Following Step(s) | Artifacts/Inputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A12 | Request Manager Approval | System (Accounting) | G2 (Path: Match Confirmed) OR G4 (Path: Resolved) | A13 | Notification |
| A13 | Review and Approve/Reject Invoice | Department Manager | A12 | G5 (Approval Check) | Invoice, PO, Confirmation |
| A14 | Schedule Invoice for Payment | Accounts Payable Clerk | G5 (Path: Approved) | (End Event) | Approved Invoice Record |

### 4. Gateways and Decision Points

| Gateway ID | Type | Name | Preceding Step(s) | Conditions/Exits | Resulting Step(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G1** | Exclusive (XOR) | Has Valid PO? | A1 (Receive Invoice) | YES (Has PO) | A3 (Log Invoice) |
| | | | | NO (Missing PO) | A2 (Request PO/Details) |
| **G2** | Exclusive (XOR) | Invoice Matches PO? | A6 (Match Line Items) | YES (Match Confirmed) | A12 (Request Approval) |
| | | | | NO (Discrepancy Found) | A7 (Clarify Discrepancy) |
| **G3** | Exclusive (XOR) | Discrepancy Resolution Path | A7 (Clarify Discrepancy) | Resolved easily | A6 (Return to Matching/Rework) |
| | | | | Requires External Input (e.g., pricing) | A8 (Consult SRM) |
| | | | | Cannot be Resolved Internally | A9 (Escalate to Supervisor) |
| **G4** | Inclusive (OR) | Exception Resolution Complete | A10 (Investigate Exception) | Resolution achieved | A12 (Request Approval) |
| | | | | Invoice Rejected (Implied variation) | (End Event: Rejected Invoice) |
| **G5** | Exclusive (XOR) | Manager Decision | A13 (Review/Approve) | APPROVED | A14 (Schedule Payment) |
| | | | | REJECTED / Suspicious | A11 (Manager Rejects/Holds) leading to A10 (Investigation) |

### 5. Summary of Exception Handling (Variations)

1. **Missing PO:** If G1 fails, the process loops back via A2 until the supplier provides the necessary PO, allowing the process to continue to A3.
2. **Discrepancy/Mismatch:** If G2 fails, the process enters a rework loop (A7, G3, A8) to resolve the issue before returning to A6 for rematching.
3. **Escalation/Unresolved Discrepancy:** If G3 leads to A9, the AP Supervisor (Rita) handles complex cases, including those missing a PO number (non-PO invoices) or requiring retrospective PO creation. After resolution (A10), the invoice re-enters the standard flow at A12.
4. **Manager Rejection:** If the manager finds the invoice suspicious (G5), it is routed back for supervisor investigation (A11 -> A10), rather than immediate payment scheduling.
