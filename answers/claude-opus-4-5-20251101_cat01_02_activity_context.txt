# Activity Renaming Analysis for Support Workflow Event Log

## 1. Identification of Recurring Activities

After analyzing the event log, I identified three activities that appear multiple times within the same cases with different contextual meanings:

| Activity | Cases with Recurrence | Contextual Variations |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Verify Documents** | C001, C003 | Initial verification vs. Re-verification after additional information |
| **Call Customer** | C002, C003 | Different purposes: requesting docs, clarifying issues, follow-up confirmation, recall customer |
| **Initiate Request** | Across cases | Different channels: online portal vs. branch walk-in |

---

## 2. Contextual Analysis and Renaming Strategy

### **Verify Documents**
- **First occurrence**: Initial identity/document check at the start of processing
- **Subsequent occurrences**: Re-verification after new documents submitted or account adjustments made

### **Call Customer**
- **C001**: Call to request missing documentation
- **C002 (first)**: Call to clarify account discrepancy
- **C002 (second)**: Follow-up call to confirm changes
- **C003**: Call to recall customer who stepped out

### **Initiate Request**
- **Online portal** submission vs. **Branch walk-in** submission

## 4. Justification of Naming Choices

| Original Activity | Renamed Activity | Contextual Clues |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Initiate Request** (WebPortal) | **Initiate Request (Online Portal)** | Resource = "WebPortal"; context mentions "online portal" |
| **Initiate Request** (BranchReception) | **Initiate Request (Branch Walk-in)** | Resource = "BranchReception"; context mentions "walk-in customer at branch" |
| **Verify Documents** (1st in C001/C002) | **Verify Documents (Initial Check)** | Occurs early in process; first verification attempt; context says "checks identity documents" |
| **Verify Documents** (2nd in C001) | **Verify Documents (Re-verification)** | Occurs after "Submit Additional"; context explicitly states "re-checks documents" |
| **Verify Documents** (1st in C003) | **Verify Documents (Physical ID Check)** | Resource = "BranchOfficer"; context mentions "physical verification" |
| **Verify Documents** (2nd in C003) | **Verify Documents (Post-Adjustment)** | Occurs after "Adjust Account"; context states "re-verify docs after account adjustment" |
| **Call Customer** (C001) | **Call Customer (Request Missing Docs)** | Context: "request missing docs"; follows incomplete verification |
| **Call Customer** (C002, 1st) | **Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy)** | Context: "clarify account discrepancy"; investigative purpose |
| **Call Customer** (C002, 2nd) | **Call Customer (Confirm Adjustments)** | Context: "confirm adjustments made"; follows account adjustment; verification purpose |
| **Call Customer** (C003) | **Call Customer (Recall to Branch)** | Context: "customer stepped out...calls to have them return"; physical presence needed |

## Summary of Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | How It Informed Renaming |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Position in sequence** | First vs. subsequent occurrences indicate initial vs. re-work activities |
| **Preceding activity** | What triggers the activity (e.g., call after failed verification vs. after adjustment) |
| **Resource/Channel** | WebPortal vs. Branch indicates digital vs. physical process variants |
| **Additional Context field** | Explicit descriptions of purpose (clarify, confirm, request, recall) |
| **Purpose of activity** | Informational, corrective, confirmatory, or procedural |
