**Solution: DuckDB SQL Query for Process Variants Analysis**
===========================================================

Below is a comprehensive DuckDB SQL query that addresses each point of your task. Note that for dynamic `K` (the number of top variants to consider), we'll use a placeholder `@K` which you should replace with your desired integer value when executing the query.

```sql
-- **Step 1 & 2: Extract Sequences and Identify Variants**
WITH 
  -- Ordered Activities per Case
  ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
      event_log
    GROUP BY 
      case_id
  ),
  
  -- Group by Variant and Count Cases
  variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
      activity_sequence AS variant,
      COUNT(case_id) AS case_count
    FROM 
      ordered_activities
    GROUP BY 
      activity_sequence
  ),

  -- **Step 3: Top K Variants**
  top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
      variant,
      case_count
    FROM 
      variant_counts
    ORDER BY 
      case_count DESC
    LIMIT @K
  )

-- **Step 4: Fetch Events for Top K Variants**
SELECT 
  e.*
FROM 
  event_log e
  INNER JOIN ordered_activities oa ON e.case_id = oa.case_id
  INNER JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON oa.activity_sequence = tkv.variant
ORDER BY 
  e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

**How to Use This Query:**

1. **Replace `@K`**: Before executing, replace `@K` with your desired number of top variants (e.g., `LIMIT 5` for the top 5 variants).

2. **Execute in DuckDB**: Paste the modified query into your DuckDB client or interface.

**Breakdown and Advice:**

- **`STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY`**: This is crucial for ensuring activities are aggregated in the order they occurred within each case.
  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Used for readability and to break down the problem into manageable steps. 
  - `ordered_activities`: Generates the sequence of activities per case.
  - `variant_counts`: Aggregates cases by their activity sequence (variant) and counts them.
  - `top_k_variants`: Filters down to the top K variants by case count.

- **Final `SELECT` with Joins**: Retrieves all original event log entries that belong to cases of the top K variants, maintaining the chronological order within each case.

- **Indexing for Performance (Optional but Recommended)**:
  - If your `event_log` table is very large, consider creating indexes on `case_id` and `timestamp` to significantly improve the query's performance:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_case_id ON event_log (case_id);
    CREATE INDEX idx_timestamp ON event_log (timestamp);
    ```

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose your `event_log` contains the following data:

| case_id | activity | timestamp           |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| 1       | A       | 2023-01-01 08:00:00 |
| 1       | B       | 2023-01-01 09:00:00 |
| 2       | A       | 2023-01-02 10:00:00 |
| 2       | C       | 2023-01-02 11:00:00 |
| 3       | A       | 2023-01-03 12:00:00 |
| 3       | B       | 2023-01-03 13:00:00 |

Setting `@K = 1` would return all events for the most frequent variant. If both `case_id=1` and `case_id=3` follow the variant `A->B`, and this is the most frequent, the query would return all events for these two cases.

**Output for the Example (with `@K = 1` and assuming `A->B` is the top variant)**:

| case_id | activity | timestamp           |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| 1       | A       | 2023-01-01 08:00:00 |
| 1       | B       | 2023-01-01 09:00:00 |
| 3       | A       | 2023-01-03 12:00:00 |
| 3       | B       | 2023-01-03 13:00:00 |
