### **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**  
**Process Mining Techniques:**  
- **Resource Contention Metrics (Cold-Packing):**  
  - Use *conformance checking* to trace orders requiring "Cold-Packing" and calculate their *waiting time before starting Packing*.  
  - Quantify queue length dynamics via *resource utilization heatmaps* (e.g., Station C1 vs. C5).  
  - **Metric:** "Average queuing time at Cold-Packing stations" filtered by Order Type (Express vs. Standard).  

- **Batching Delays:**  
  - Apply *dependency graphs* to identify orders grouped into the same batch for geographic regions.  
  - Measure "time from Quality Check completion to Shipping Label Generation" as batch formation latency.  
  - **Metric:** "Median batch formation time per region" and "throughput loss due to batch waiting."  

- **Priority Handling Gaps:**  
  - Use *Petri-net models* to trace Express orders’ activities. Detect *preemption events* where Express orders delay Standard orders’ resource access (e.g., Standard order paused at Packing for >2 mins when Express order used the same station).  
  - **Metric:** "Ratio of Express-to-Standard preemptions" and "additional cycle time for Standard orders."  

- **Hazardous Limits Violations:**  
  - Aggregated the *time-windows* where >10 Hazardous orders were in Packing/Quality Check simultaneously via *temporal queries*.  
  - **Metric:** "Frequency of non-compliance events" and "mean delay for Hazardous orders to enter Packing."  

**Differentiating Within-Instance vs. Between-Instance Delays:**  
- **Within-instance:** Activity runtime variance (e.g., Picker 3 vs. Picker 4 for Item Picking). Use *process trees* to flag unusually long/noisy activities.  
- **Between-instance:** Focus on gaps between activity completions and next starts (e.g., ORD-5001 waited 15 mins at Shipping Label Gen. due to batch hold). Tools like *YAWL workflow engine* can decompose timelines.

### **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**  
**Key Interactions:**  
- **Cold-Packing × Priority Handling:** Express orders often require Cold-Packing, intensifying competition. A Cold-Packing station occupied by a Standard order would delay Express orders, increasing their cycle time beyond SLAs.  
- **Batching × Hazardous Limits:** If 15 Hazardous orders are destined for the same region, batching forces 10 orders to wait until the next batch window, violating the 10-order limit *during batch formation*.  
- **Priority × Hazardous Compliance:** Express orders flagged as Hazardous could preempt Standard orders, but sudden inflows might breach the 10-order limit, triggering delays.  

**Why Interactions Matter:**  
- Solving one constraint worsens another (e.g., adding Cold-Packing stations reduces Express delays but risks underutilizing capacity during off-peak times).  
- Example: A "Cold-Packing priority rule" might free Express orders but increase Standard order waits at other steps (e.g., Quality Check).

### **3. Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**  
**Strategy 1: Intelligence Wave Scheduling for Cold-Packing**  
- **Primary Constraints:** Shared Cold-Packing, Priority Handling.  
- **Proposed Changes:**  
  - Use *integrated forecasting* to predict hourly demand for Cold-Packing based on historical Order Type and Region patterns.  
  - Reserve 2 Cold stations solely for Express orders during peak hours (e.g., 8 AM–12 PM) using *static priorities* in the process model.  
  - Implement a "Rotating Backlog" for Standard orders: Process older Standard orders before newer ones if stations are idle.  
- **Data/Analysis:**  
  - Train a *time-series model (e.g., Prophet)* on past Cold-Packing utilization to trigger alerts for proactive pre-allocation.  
  - Measure impact via "Express order on-time delivery rate" and "Standard order cycle time variance."  

**Strategy 2: Dynamic Geographical Batch Formation**  
- **Primary Constraints:** Batching, Hazardous Limits.  
- **Proposed Changes:**  
  - Shift from static ("batch every 15 mins") to *demand-driven batching*: Form batches when 80% of predicted regional orders arrive + 1 Express order.  
  - Use *clustering algorithms* (e.g., k-means) to group Hazardous orders into dedicated batches to avoid exceeding the 10-order limit.  
- **Data/Analysis:**  
  - Deploy a *redispatching rule engine* with historical batch success rates (e.g., batch size vs. compliance).  
  - Track "average batch flexibility index" (ability to add/remove orders before final dispatch).  

**Strategy 3: Compliance-Driven Lane Segmentation**  
- **Primary Constraints:** Hazardous Limits, Batching, Priority Handling.  
- **Proposed Changes:**  
  - Dedicate 1 Quality Check staff and 1 Packing station to *solely process Hazardous orders* during off-peak windows (e.g., 7 PM–10 PM shift).  
  - Integrate a "Compliance Thermometer" dashboard showing real-time counts of Hazardous orders in active steps.  
- **Data/Analysis:**  
  - Use *SOM (Self-Organizing Maps)* to identify regions with high Hazardous order density and pre-allocate resources.  
  - Monitor "Hazardous order compliance adherence rate" (e.g., % of time slots 10 orders active).

### **4. Simulation and Validation**  
**Simulation Approach:**  
- Build a *discrete-event simulation (DES)* model in tools like AnyLogic or ExtendSim, incorporating:  
  - **Resource Contention:** Stations with probabilistic Cold-Packing demand (modeled via empirical distributions from the log).  
  - **Batch Logic:** Queues for regional batches triggered by threshold conditions (e.g., 7 orders + 2 Express).  
  - **Compliance Gates:** Nodes that enforce the 10-order limit via blocking orders until a slot opens.  

**Critical Validation Metrics:**  
- **Cold-Packing Efficiency:** "System-wide station throughput" vs. "ideal capacity" (5 stations × 7.5 hrs/day).  
- **Batch Responsiveness:** "Time to 90% batch formation" across regions.  
- **Compliance Resilience:** "Peak concurrent Hazardous orders" over 24-hour windows.  
- **Priority Fairness:** "Express order brownout periods" (minutes/day where all express orders wait for resources).  

**Assumptions to Test:**  
- Do Express preemptions disproportionately affect late-night/non-peak Standard orders?  
- Can dynamic batching increase average batch sizes without violating truck capacity limits?

### **5. Monitoring Post-Implementation**  
**Dashboard KPIs (Process Mining Engineered):**  
| **Constraint**          | **Indicative Metric**                      | **ML/PM Validation**          |  
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| Cold-Packing              | 95th percentile queue length at C1-C5      | ARIMA forecasting vs. actual    |  
| Batching                 | Ratio of "full batches" to "partial batches"  | Cluster analysis per region      |  
| Priority Handling        | % of Express orders that trigger >3 preemptions | Markov chain transition risks  |  
| Hazardous Compliance      | Daily compliance breaches (turnover rate)  | Temporal anomaly detection         |  

**Actionable Exceptions:**  
- **Intelligent Alerting:** Flag batches missing >3 Hazardous orders from a region (risk of future compliance breaches).  
- **Corrective Levers:** Auto-trigger a 15% capacity buffer for Cold-Packing stations for 3 days if a region’s batch latency exceeds 60 mins.  

**Continuous Improvement:**  
- Run *drift detection* on log data weekly to adapt rules (e.g., adjust batch thresholds if regional delivery zones change).  
- Use *multi-armed bandit algorithms* to test new prioritization rules (e.g., alternate Express vs. Standard preemption).

### **Conclusion**  
By combining process mining’s analytical rigor with simulation-driven validation, the company can systematically attack interdependent constraints. Strategic augmentation (e.g., dedicated resource lanes) paired with predictive rules (e.g., dynamic batching thresholds) will reduce end-to-end lead times by 20–30% without requiring new capital investment. Continuous monitoring ensures constraints are managed *systemically*, not siloed.
