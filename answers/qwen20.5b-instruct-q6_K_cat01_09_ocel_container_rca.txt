Based on the information provided, there are several potential root causes that could be affecting the performance of the process:

1. Incorrect event frequency: It is possible that some events may be repeated more than once while others are missed or skipped, resulting in a lower throughput rate.

2. Inconsistent data entry: The system could have issues with entering data accurately and consistently. This could lead to incorrect events being recorded or processed incorrectly.

3. Data cleaning: Any errors in data entry, such as missing fields or formatting changes, could result in inaccurate information being counted.

4. Incorrect object types: Some objects may be misclassified, leading to errors in the system's tracking of inventory and customer orders.

5. Slow processing: The system may require a lot of time to process each event, causing delays and potential errors.

6. Incorrect storage or handling: Any physical issues with the systems' storage equipment could lead to inaccuracies in data entry or storage.

7. Overload: If there is too much inventory or orders being processed at once, it could overload the system and cause errors or issues.

8. Inadequate training: If there are no adequate training sessions for new personnel, they may not understand how to properly process events or use the system effectively.

9. Network connectivity issues: A poor or outdated network connection could slow down processing and lead to issues with data entry or processing.

10. Hardware malfunction: Issues such as computer hardware malfunctions or software bugs could also cause errors in inventory tracking, processing, or performance.

It is recommended to conduct a thorough review of the system's code, architecture, and configuration, and test it thoroughly to ensure all aspects are working correctly before making any significant changes.
