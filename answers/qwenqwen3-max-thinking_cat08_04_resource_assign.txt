# Optimizing TechSolve’s Resource Assignment Using Process Mining: A Data-Driven Approach

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### Agent and Tier Performance Metrics
Using the event log, I would compute the following key metrics to understand agent and tier behavior:

- **Workload Distribution**:  
  - Number of tickets handled per agent/tier per time unit (e.g., daily/weekly).  
  - Queue length and wait time before assignment per agent/tier.  
  - Variance in workload across agents within the same tier to identify over/under-utilization.

- **Processing Efficiency**:  
  - *Cycle time per activity*: e.g., “Work L1 Start” to “Work L1 End” for L1 agents.  
  - *Handling time per ticket type/skill*: e.g., average resolution time for “App-CRM” tickets by L2 agents with that skill.  
  - *First-call resolution (FCR) rate*: % of L1 tickets resolved without escalation, broken down by category and priority.

- **Skill Utilization**:  
  - % of tickets assigned to agents who possess the *required skill* (e.g., “Networking-Firewall” ticket  agent with that skill).  
  - Frequency with which specialized agents (e.g., L3 Security-IAM) are assigned non-specialized tasks (e.g., password resets).

- **Escalation & Reassignment Patterns**:  
  - Escalation rate from L1  L2/L3 by ticket category/priority.  
  - Reassignment frequency per ticket and per agent (e.g., how often Agent B12 reassigns tickets).

### Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Discovery

- **Resource Interaction Analysis (Handover Networks)**:  
  Construct a social network where nodes are agents and edges represent ticket handovers (e.g., Agent A05  Agent B12). High-frequency handovers between specific agents may indicate informal expertise routing or systemic bottlenecks. Compare this to the *intended* tiered escalation path (L1  L2  L3) to detect deviations like L1  L3 jumps or circular reassignments.

- **Role Discovery**:  
  Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., based on activity profiles or skill usage) to identify *actual* roles beyond formal tiers. For example, some L2 agents may consistently handle only “Database-SQL” tickets—effectively acting as a de facto L3 specialist. This reveals misalignment between organizational roles and operational reality.

- **Conformance Checking on Assignment Rules**:  
  Model the *expected* assignment logic (e.g., “P2 Network tickets  L2 Networking-Firewall agents”) as a process model and compare it against the event log. Deviations (e.g., P2 Network ticket assigned to non-network L2 agent) highlight rule violations or gaps in the current logic.

- **Skill Coverage Heatmaps**:  
  Cross-tabulate *required skills* vs. *agent skills* to visualize coverage gaps. For instance, if 30% of “Security-IAM” tickets are handled by agents without that skill, this signals a systemic mismatch.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Using the above analyses, I would pinpoint specific inefficiencies:

- **Skill-Based Bottlenecks**:  
  If tickets requiring “Database-SQL” consistently experience long wait times before L2 assignment, and only 2 agents possess this skill, this indicates a capacity bottleneck. Quantify by measuring average queue delay for such tickets vs. others.

- **Reassignment-Induced Delays**:  
  Calculate the *time penalty* of reassignments: compare resolution time for tickets with 0 vs. 2 assignments. If reassignment adds >2 hours on average (as in INC-1001), and 25% of P2/P3 tickets are reassigned, this directly contributes to SLA breaches.

- **Incorrect Initial Assignments**:  
  Track tickets escalated within <15 minutes of L1 start—suggesting poor initial routing. If 40% of P3 “Software-App” tickets are escalated immediately by L1, the dispatcher may be assigning them to agents lacking even basic app troubleshooting skills.

- **Agent Imbalance**:  
  Identify top/bottom quartile agents by workload (tickets/day) and performance (resolution time). If Agent A01 handles 2× the tickets of Agent A09 with similar resolution quality, workload distribution is flawed.

- **SLA Breach Correlation**:  
  Use decision tree analysis to correlate SLA breaches with resource factors. Example finding: *“P2 tickets reassigned 2 times are 5× more likely to breach SLA”* or *“Tickets assigned to agents missing required skill have 70% higher breach rate.”*

**Quantified Impact Example**:  
> “Reassignments add an average of 3.2 hours to resolution time. With 18% of P2/P3 tickets reassigned, this accounts for ~35% of all SLA breaches in these priority classes.”

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Potential root causes—validated through process mining—include:

- **Oversimplified Assignment Logic**:  
  Round-robin ignores real-time workload and skill alignment. Variant analysis shows that tickets assigned via “skill-match” paths (even if informal) resolve 40% faster than round-robin paths.

- **Inaccurate Skill Profiles**:  
  Agents may lack documented skills they actually possess (or vice versa). Compare *declared skills* in the log with *actual ticket resolution success* by skill type. If Agent B08 resolves “Networking-Firewall” tickets successfully but lacks the skill tag, the profile is outdated.

- **Poor Ticket Triage**:  
  Initial categorization errors (e.g., “Network” ticket mislabeled as “Software-App”) lead to wrong skill assignment. Use NLP on ticket descriptions to validate category accuracy and correlate misclassification with reassignment rates.

- **L1 Under-Empowerment**:  
  High L1 escalation rates for “Access Management” tickets may stem from lack of access to reset tools or training. Decision mining reveals that L1 agents with >6 months tenure escalate 30% less—suggesting experience/training gaps.

- **No Real-Time Workload Visibility**:  
  Dispatchers assign tickets without knowing if an agent is already handling 5 high-priority tickets. This causes queue buildup and delays.

**Variant Analysis Application**:  
Compare two variants:  
- *Variant A*: Ticket  L1 (correct skill)  resolved.  
- *Variant B*: Ticket  L1 (no skill)  escalate  L2 (correct skill)  resolved.  
Decision mining identifies that *initial L1 skill match* is the strongest predictor of no escalation (85% accuracy), proving skill-based routing is critical.

## 4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: **Intelligent Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**
- **Issue Addressed**: Mismatch between required skills and agent capabilities; underutilization of specialists.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Heatmaps show only 55% of tickets are initially assigned to agents with required skills; specialists spend 30% time on low-complexity tasks.
- **Implementation Data**:  
  - Required: Agent skill matrix with proficiency levels (e.g., “App-CRM: Advanced”), real-time ticket skill tags.  
  - Algorithm: Assign to agent with highest proficiency in required skill and lowest current workload.
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  - 25–40% reduction in escalations/reassignments.  
  - 15–20% faster resolution for P2/P3 tickets.  
  - Better utilization of L2/L3 specialists on high-value tasks.

### Strategy 2: **Dynamic Workload-Aware Assignment**
- **Issue Addressed**: Uneven workload distribution; delays due to overloading specific agents.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Top 20% agents handle 50% of tickets; their average handling time is 2× higher due to context switching.
- **Implementation Data**:  
  - Required: Real-time queue length per agent, active ticket count, SLA deadlines.  
  - Algorithm: Assign new tickets to agents with lowest (workload × priority weight) score.
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  - Balanced agent utilization (±10% variance).  
  - Reduced wait time before assignment by 30–50%.  
  - Fewer SLA breaches due to proactive load leveling.

### Strategy 3: **Predictive Escalation Prevention for L1**
- **Issue Addressed**: Unnecessary escalations due to L1 agents attempting tasks beyond their capability.
- **Process Mining Insight**: 60% of L1 escalations for “Access Management” tickets occur within 10 minutes; historical data shows these are rarely resolvable by L1.
- **Implementation Data**:  
  - Required: Historical resolution success rates by L1 agent, ticket category, and priority; NLP-extracted ticket complexity features.  
  - Algorithm: If ticket matches “high-escalation-risk” profile (e.g., P2 + Network + new L1 agent), auto-assign to L2 or provide L1 with guided resolution playbook.
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  - 20–30% reduction in avoidable escalations.  
  - Increased L1 FCR rate by 15%.  
  - Faster resolution by skipping unproductive L1 attempts.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### Pre-Implementation Simulation
- **Approach**: Use the mined process model (including resource roles, performance distributions, and decision rules) to build a discrete-event simulation.
- **Scenarios Tested**:  
  - Baseline (current round-robin).  
  - Skill-based routing only.  
  - Skill + workload-aware routing.  
  - Predictive escalation prevention.
- **Metrics Simulated**:  
  - Average resolution time by priority.  
  - % SLA compliance.  
  - Agent utilization balance.  
  - Reassignment frequency.
- **Outcome**: Quantify expected ROI (e.g., “Workload-aware + skill routing reduces P2 SLA breaches by 45%”) to prioritize implementation.

### Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan
Deploy a **real-time process mining dashboard** tracking:

- **Resource KPIs**:  
  - Agent workload balance (Gini coefficient).  
  - Skill match rate (% tickets assigned to agents with required skill).  
  - Reassignment rate per tier.  
  - L1 FCR rate by category.

- **Process Health Views**:  
  - Variant explorer: Flag new reassignment-heavy variants.  
  - Bottleneck monitor: Alert on rising queue times for specific skills.  
  - SLA compliance heatmap: Correlate breaches with assignment patterns.

- **Feedback Loop**:  
  Monthly conformance checks against the new assignment rules.  
  Retrain predictive models quarterly using new event log data.
