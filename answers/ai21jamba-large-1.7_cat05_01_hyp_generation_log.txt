### Initial Observations of Anomalies in the Event Log

Based on the given event log, several **anomalies** and **undesirable behaviors** are present in the data. Below is a structured analysis:

### **Anomalies and Hypotheses**

1. **Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
	- **Observation:** Certain activities occur **out of sequence** compared to the assumed normal process flow (e.g., `Confirm Shipment` occurring before `Validate Stock` in `case_id` 1002 and `case_id` 1003).
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- **System Error:** A workflow system issue could have triggered events in an incorrect order.
		- **Policy Violation:** Teams could be bypassing standard checks or steps to expedite the order process.
		- **Resource Training Issues:** Resources (e.g., Logistics Manager) may not be fully aware of proper sequence requirements.
2. **Early or Late Actions:**
	- **Observation:** Some actions occur **earlier or later** than expected:
	- `Confirm Shipment` for `case_id` 1002 and 1003 happens **before Stock Validation** (`case_id` 1002 also shows an "attempted_early" note).
	- `Receive Payment` for `case_id` 1004 happens **before Issuing the Invoice**.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- **System Clock Sync Issues:** Timestamps could reflect misalignment across different system modules (e.g., Finance, Logistics modules).
		- **Manual Overrides:** The involved resources may have overridden system-enforced delays or checks.
3. **Missing or Skipped Activities:**
	- **Observation:** The following events appear to be skipped:
	- `Validate Stock` in `case_id` 1003 is missing before `Ship Goods`.
	- `Confirm Shipment` is skipped for `case_id` 1004 before `Ship Goods`.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- **Workflow Bypass:** Teams may be skipping steps if they believe the checks are redundant or if there is time pressure.
		- **Data Entry Errors:** Event records may not have been logged even if the activity took place.
4. **Duplicate or Unnecessary Steps:**
	- **Observation:** Some activities are **duplicated** or performed out of standard sequence:
	- `Validate Stock` happens **after Confirm Shipment** in `case_id` 1002.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- **Manual Retry:** Resources could have retried a step if the initial attempt failed.
		- **Process Misalignment:** A lag or delay in system updates may result in reruns of certain checks.
5. **Unusual Role or Department Assignments:**
	- **Observation:** Certain resources are working outside their typical department responsibilities:
	- For instance, `FinanceTeam_02` recorded the `amount` for `case_id` 1004 while the `invoice_id` was issued by `FinanceTeam_01`.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- **Cross-Department Assignment Issues:** Resources may have been misassigned to tasks outside their roles (possibly leading to errors).
		- **Training and SOP Gaps:** Staff may lack clarity on precise responsibilities for sequence compliance.
6. **Mismatch of Roles and Actions:**
	- **Observation:** In `case_id` 1003, `Ship Goods` happens **before Confirm Shipment**. This action is out of alignment with the assumed process.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- **Policy Violation:** Staff may bypass standard confirmations if under pressure or if they incorrectly assess readiness.

### **Proposed SQL Queries to Investigate Hypotheses**

#### **1. Investigate Sequence Anomalies (Out-of-Order Events)**

```sql
-- Identify events occurring out of the assumed sequence
SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity NOT IN (
    SELECT activity
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER
