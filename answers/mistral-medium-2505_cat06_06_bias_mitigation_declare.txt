Here’s the updated `declare_model` with new constraints to mitigate bias, followed by a rationale for each addition:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # Ensure manual review exists for fairness checks
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensure bias checks exist
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Ensure manual review coexists with decisions
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Ensure bias checks coexist with sensitive attribute checks
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Require bias check after sensitive attribute check
    },
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Bias check must precede final decision
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Manual review must follow bias check
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Prevent direct coexistence of sensitive checks and decisions
    },
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Prevent direct succession from sensitive checks to decisions
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints:
1. **`ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` in `existence`:**
   - Ensures these fairness-related activities are part of the process, reducing the risk of unchecked biased decisions.

2. **`FinalDecision` coexists with `ManualReview`:**
   - Forces a manual review to occur alongside any final decision, ensuring human oversight for fairness.

3. **`CheckApplicantRace` coexists with `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - Ensures that whenever sensitive attributes (e.g., race) are checked, a bias mitigation step is also performed.

4. **`CheckApplicantRace` responds to `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - Requires a bias check to immediately follow any sensitive attribute check, preventing unchecked bias.

5. **`BiasMitigationCheck` precedes `FinalDecision`:**
   - Ensures bias checks occur before any final decision, reducing the risk of biased outcomes.

6. **`BiasMitigationCheck` succeeds to `ManualReview`:**
   - Ensures manual review follows bias checks, adding another layer of fairness validation.

7. **`CheckApplicantRace` does not coexist or succeed directly to `FinalDecision`:**
   - Prevents direct transitions from sensitive attribute checks to decisions, forcing intermediate fairness steps.

These constraints collectively ensure that sensitive attributes do not directly influence decisions without proper checks and reviews, thereby mitigating bias in the loan application process.
