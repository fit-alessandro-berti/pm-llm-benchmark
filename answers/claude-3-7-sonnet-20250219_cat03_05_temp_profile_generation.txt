I'll create a temporal profile for the global supply chain process for high-tech electronics manufacturing. This will include estimated average times and standard deviations between various activities in the process, considering both directly connected activities and those that eventually follow each other.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct sequential activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 43200),      # Supplier Selection → Order Placement: ~2 days avg, 12hr std
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 259200),    # Order Placement → Receive Components: ~14 days avg, 3 days std
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),       # Receive Components → Quality Inspection: ~1 day avg, 6hr std
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 43200),      # Quality Inspection → Component Assembly: ~2 days avg, 12hr std
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),      # Component Assembly → Product Testing: ~3 days avg, 1 day std
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 21600),       # Product Testing → Packaging: ~1 day avg, 6hr std
    ('PK', 'WS'): (43200, 10800),       # Packaging → Warehouse Storage: ~12hr avg, 3hr std
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),      # Warehouse Storage → Distribution: ~3 days avg, 1 day std
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1209600, 604800),    # Distribution → After-Sales Support: ~14 days avg, 7 days std
    
    # Non-adjacent activities (eventually following)

This temporal profile captures the complex relationships between activities in the high-tech electronics supply chain. The times are represented in seconds, with larger standard deviations for activities that have more variability (like international shipping or complex assembly processes). The profile includes both directly connected activities and those that eventually follow each other, providing a comprehensive view of the temporal aspects of the process.
