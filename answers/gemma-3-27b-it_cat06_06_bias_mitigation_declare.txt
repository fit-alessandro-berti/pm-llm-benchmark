# Explanation of Added Constraints:

# 1. Existence of ManualReview and BiasMitigationCheck: Ensures these activities are possible in the process.
# 2. Coexistence of ManualReview with Decision Steps for Sensitive Applicants:
#    - "Approve_Minority", "Reject_Minority", "RequestAdditionalInfo_Minority" are assumed to be activities representing decisions made for applicants from minority groups.
#    - These constraints enforce that if a decision is made for a minority applicant, a `ManualReview` must also occur in the trace. This adds a layer of human oversight to potentially biased decisions.
# 3. Response: BiasMitigationCheck after sensitive attribute check:
#    - Ensures that after checking an applicant's race or gender, a `BiasMitigationCheck` is performed before any decision is made.
# 4. Succession: BiasMitigationCheck before decision:
#    - Ensures that a decision (Approve, Reject, RequestAdditionalInfo) can only directly follow a `BiasMitigationCheck`.
# 5. Non-succession: Prevent direct succession from sensitive attribute check to Reject/Approve:
#    - Prevents a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` or `CheckApplicantGender` to `Reject` or `Approve`. This forces a `BiasMitigationCheck` to occur before a decision is made, preventing immediate biased outcomes.

# These constraints aim to reduce bias by introducing checks and oversight when sensitive attributes are considered, ensuring that decisions are not made solely based on these attributes.
