Below is one acceptable answer. In our view the global process always starts by receiving an order, sourcing the materials, and screening the quality. Then the “production” phase follows, which is made of an assembly phase that may be repeated (if the inline quality check, IQC, does not pass) and a testing phase that may be repeated (if the product initially fails testing, requiring a retest). After testing, the product is packaged and then, optionally, labeled (in some cases labels are skipped). Finally, a distribution planning step is performed before dispatch.

One way to capture this in a POWL model is as follows. (Remember that with the LOOP operator defined as  
* (A, B)  
you execute A first and then either exit or execute B and then A again.)

Step 1. Define transitions for the key activities (and a silent transition “skip” for the alternative to LB):

• OR – Order Received  
• MS – Material Sourcing  
• QS – Quality Screening  
• AS – Assembly  
• IQC – In-line Quality Check  
• TST – Testing  
• RT – Re-Testing  
• PK – Packaging  
• LB – Labeling  
• DP – Distribution Planning  
• D – Dispatch

Step 2. Model the repetitive parts as loops and the optional part as a choice:

a. Assembly/IQC loop:  
We assume that an initial assembly is done and then, if the IQC check requires it, assembly is repeated. In POWL we represent this by  
LOOP(AS, IQC)

b. Testing/re-testing loop:  
Here, the product is tested and, if necessary (i.e. if the first test fails), a re-test is performed before testing again. This is captured by  
LOOP(TST, RT)

c. Optional labeling:  
Since labeling may be omitted, we use a XOR operator to choose either LB or (a silent) skip. In POWL:  
XOR(LB, skip)

Step 3. Impose the overall order with a StrictPartialOrder. The overall “skeleton” of the process is:

OR  MS  QS  [Assembly/IQC loop]  [Testing/RT loop]  PK  [optional LB]  DP  D

Below is one possible final POWL structure (presented in Pythonlike pseudocode):

------------------------------------------------------------
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions for key activities.
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

# Define a silent transition to represent the possibility of skipping LB.
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define the loop for the assembly phase:
# First, perform assembly; then either exit or perform IQC and reassemble.
assembly_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])

# Define the loop for the testing phase:
# First, perform testing; then either exit or perform re-testing and test again.
testing_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Define the XOR choice for labeling (either perform labeling, or skip it).
labeling_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

# Create the global process model using a strict partial order.
powl_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, assembly_loop, testing_loop, PK, labeling_choice, DP, D])

# Impose the execution order:
powl_model.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
powl_model.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
powl_model.order.add_edge(QS, assembly_loop)
powl_model.order.add_edge(assembly_loop, testing_loop)
powl_model.order.add_edge(testing_loop, PK)
powl_model.order.add_edge(PK, labeling_choice)
powl_model.order.add_edge(labeling_choice, DP)
powl_model.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# (No further ordering is needed between activities that are concurrent by default.)
------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the model:

1. The process starts with OR, followed by MS and QS in strict sequence.
2. The assembly_loop (LOOP(AS, IQC)) models that after an initial AS the process may “loop back” by performing an IQC and then AS again as many times as required.
3. After the assembly phase, testing is performed. The testing_loop (LOOP(TST, RT)) captures the possibility of re-testing before settling on a successful test.
4. Packaging (PK) is done next.
5. Then labeling is either performed or skipped—modeled via a XOR operator between LB and a silent transition.
6. Finally, distribution planning (DP) and dispatch (D) occur in sequence.

This POWL structure provides a simplified yet complete representation of the global manufacturing and distribution process as recorded in the complex event log.
