Alright — let’s build the **Log Skeleton** step by step for this **order fulfillment** process.

---

## Step 1: Understanding constraints from the process
We have the following **workflow**:

1. **Receive Order (RO)** – start event when order arrives.
2. **Check Availability (CA)** – ensure the item is available.
3. **Reserve Items (RI)** – block the stock.
4. **Pick Items (PI)** – physically pick the items.
5. **Quality Check (QC)** – ensure correct and undamaged products.
6. **Pack Order (PO)** – prepare the package.
7. **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** – print and attach the label.
8. **Dispatch (D)** – send to carrier.
9. **Invoice Customer (IC)** – request payment.
10. **Record Payment (RP)** – confirm payment.

---

### Step 2: Decide on **constraints** one by one

#### **(a) Equivalence**
Equivalence means the two activities **always occur the same number of times per case**.

- Every order processed will generate exactly **one invoice** and will **record exactly one payment**  `IC` and `RP` are equivalent.
- All shipped orders require a generated **shipping label**  `PO` and `GSL` both occur **exactly once** and always together.

```python
equivalence = {
    ('IC', 'RP'),      # Invoice is always followed by a payment record in same case
    ('PO', 'GSL')      # Packing and generating label always happen together
}
```

---

#### **(b) Always Before**
If **activity A** occurs, **activity B** must have occurred *before it*.

From workflow:

- `CA` always before `RI` (must check before reserving).
- `RI` always before `PI`.
- `PI` always before `QC`.
- `QC` always before `PO`.
- `PO` always before `GSL`.
- `GSL` always before `D`.
- `IC` always before `RP`.

```python
always_before = {
    ('RI', 'CA'),
    ('PI', 'RI'),
    ('QC', 'PI'),
    ('PO', 'QC'),
    ('GSL', 'PO'),
    ('D', 'GSL'),
    ('RP', 'IC')
}
```

---

#### **(c) Always After**
If **activity A** occurs, **activity B** must come *after* it.

From workflow (reverse of `always_before` relations):

- `RO` always after `D`? Actually, no. It's the starting point, so others follow RO.
- We can define natural follows:
    - `RO` always after  none.
    - `CA` always after `RI`.
    - `RI` always after `PI`.
    - `PI` always after `QC`.
    - `QC` always after `PO`.
    - `PO` always after `GSL`.
    - `GSL` always after `D`.
    - `IC` always after `RP`.

But careful: *Always after* is symmetrical to always before for each pair.

```python
always_after = {
    ('CA', 'RI'),
    ('RI', 'PI'),
    ('PI', 'QC'),
    ('QC', 'PO'),
    ('PO', 'GSL'),
    ('GSL', 'D'),
    ('IC', 'RP')
}
```

---

#### **(d) Never Together**
Certain activities never happen in same case:

- No "Reserve Items" without "Pick Items" in this process — but that is already covered in dependency.
- A realistic exclusion: If the warehouse runs out of stock (would be another activity like "Cancel Order"), but it is not in this scenario.  
We can keep it empty if no mutual exclusivity exists.

```python
never_together = set()
```

---

#### **(e) Activity Occurrences**
In a standard case:

- Each activity occurs exactly **once** per order in our process:
```python
activ_freq = {
    'RO': {1},
    'CA': {1},
    'RI': {1},
    'PI': {1},
    'QC': {1},
    'PO': {1},
    'GSL': {1},
    'D': {1},
    'IC': {1},
    'RP': {1}
}
```

---

#### **(f) Directly-Follows Constraints**
If activity A occurs, B is **immediately after** at some point *sequentially*.

- RO  CA  
- CA  RI  
- RI  PI  
- PI  QC  
- QC  PO  
- PO  GSL  
- GSL  D  
- IC  RP *(not necessarily sequential, often parallel to shipping — but for simplicity, let's keep sequential billing after dispatch)*

```python
directly_follows = {
    ('RO', 'CA'),
    ('CA', 'RI'),
    ('RI', 'PI'),
    ('PI', 'QC'),
    ('QC', 'PO'),
    ('PO', 'GSL'),
    ('GSL', 'D'),
    ('IC', 'RP')
}
```

---

### Step 3: **Complete Log Skeleton Dictionary**

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('IC', 'RP'),
        ('PO', 'GSL')
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('RI', 'CA'),
        ('PI', 'RI'),
        ('QC', 'PI'),
        ('PO', 'QC'),
        ('GSL', 'PO'),
        ('D', 'GSL'),
        ('RP', 'IC')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
```

Do you want me to **extend** this Log Skeleton to account for **exception cases** like *partial shipments*, *backorders*, or *cancelled orders* so the constraints are not always strict? That would make it more realistic for a **large-scale distribution center**.
