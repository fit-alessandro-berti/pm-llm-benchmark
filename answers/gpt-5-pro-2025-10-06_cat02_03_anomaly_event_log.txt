Expected P2P flow (typical): Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods/Services  Receive Vendor Invoice  3way match (PO–GR–Invoice)  Release Payment  Close Case. Payments should be blocked until a successful match; POs should not be issued before PR approval; goods are typically not received without a PO.

Case-by-case review

Case 1001 – Looks standard
- Sequence follows best practice: PR  approval  PO  goods receipt  invoice  match  payment  close.
- No anomalies detected.

Case 1002 – Multiple control breaches
- PO issued before PR approval: Issue Purchase Order (08:40) occurs before Approve Purchase Requisition (later on 02-03 08:00). This bypasses spend authorization and increases risk of unauthorized purchases.
- Payment released before PR approval, goods receipt, and matching: Vendor Invoice Received (02-03 07:00)  Release Payment (07:15)  Approve PR (08:00)  Receive Goods (02-04)  Match (02-05). Paying within 15 minutes of invoice receipt and before 3way match is a major control failure (risk of overbilling, fraud, or paying for undelivered goods).
- Goods received after payment: Heightened supplier performance and recovery risk if goods are not delivered or are nonconforming.
- “After-the-fact” approval: Approving the PR after PO issuance and even after payment suggests rubber-stamping, undermining approval controls.

Case 1003 – Prepayment without supporting controls
- Payment released before invoice, goods receipt, and match: Release Payment (02-08) precedes Vendor Invoice Received (02-09), Receive Goods (02-10), and Match (02-11). If this is an intentional advance/down payment, there should be explicit prepayment steps (e.g., down payment request/approval, pro forma invoice) and specific reconciliation events. Absent those, it violates standard payment controls.
- Match occurs only after payment: Breaks the 3way match gate; risk of paying wrong price/quantity or duplicate invoices.

Case 1004 – After-the-fact PO / no-PO receipt
- Goods received before PO issuance: Receive Goods (02-06 09:00) occurs before Issue Purchase Order (09:15). This suggests an “after-the-fact PO” or non-PO purchase. It bypasses commercial terms and price controls negotiated via the PO and can force manual workarounds to match later.
- While payment follows a match (good), the initial sequence still represents a policy and control breach; many systems should not allow GR without an existing PO.

Why these anomalies are problematic
- Authorization risk: Issuing POs or paying before PR approval enables unapproved spend and budget overruns.
- Financial control risk: Paying before successful 3way match (and before receipt) increases risk of overpayment, duplicate payment, or fraud.
- Operational/commercial risk: Receiving without a PO weakens leverage on price/terms, complicates returns, and hinders accurate accruals.
- Audit/compliance risk: “After-the-fact” approvals and matches are classic red flags that can lead to audit findings and control deficiencies.

Summary of flagged cases
- 1001: Clean.
- 1002: PO before approval; payment before approval/GR/match; GR after payment; match after payment.
- 1003: Payment before invoice/GR/match (prepayment without explicit prepayment process).
- 1004: Goods receipt before PO issuance (after-the-fact PO/no-PO scenario).
