Opposite Concept:

  * Manual Process Discovery
  * Reactive Monitoring
  * Top-down Discovery
  * Manual Process Simulation
  * Process Inefficiency
  * Delayed Monitoring

More General Concept:

  * Process Management
  * Monitoring and Analysis
  * Discovery and Simulation
  * Process Improvement
  * Monitoring Techniques
  * Monitoring Timing

Explanation:
Manual Process Discovery refers to the process of manually discovering and understanding the flow of a process, instead of automating it. Reactive Monitoring involves monitoring a process only after it has been completed, rather than predicting and preventing issues beforehand. Top-down Discovery refers to a process discovery technique that involves starting with a high-level view of the process and breaking it down into smaller components, as opposed to bottom-up discovery, which starts with the individual components and builds up to the overall process.
Manual Process Simulation involves manually creating a model of a process and simulating it, rather than automating the simulation process. Process Inefficiency refers to a process that is not optimized and has room for improvement. Delayed Monitoring involves monitoring a process at a later time, rather than in real-time.
Process Management is a more general concept that encompasses a wide range of activities related to managing and improving processes. Monitoring and Analysis refers to the process of collecting and analyzing data to gain insights into a process. Discovery and Simulation refers to the process of discovering and modeling a process. Process Improvement refers to the process of identifying and implementing changes to improve a process. Monitoring Techniques refers to the various methods used to monitor a process. Monitoring Timing refers to the timing of when a process is monitored.
