- Which log shows bias: Group B (Unprotected Group).

- How the bias manifests:
  - A +5 “cultural fit” adjustment is granted only to candidates affiliated with the LocalBusinessLeadersClub. This is unrelated to job-relevant performance and is not applied uniformly.
  - The boost changes outcomes for borderline candidates:
    - U003: Cultural fit 58 becomes 63 with the boost  Hired. Without the boost, likely Not Hired (others at 60 were rejected).
    - U001: Cultural fit 60 becomes 65  Hired; the adjustment likely moved the candidate over the hiring threshold.
  - Group A candidates with similar or higher skill/personality scores receive no such adjustment, creating disparate treatment based on association membership (and indirectly, local residency/network access).

- Why this is unfair:
  - It advantages a social/network affiliation rather than job-related merit, embedding favoritism (homophily/nepotism).
  - Association membership can act as a proxy for socioeconomic status or other protected attributes, risking proxy discrimination.
  - Even if overall hire rates look similar in this small sample, the process-level bias systematically benefits a subset, harming equity and potentially narrowing diversity.

- Implications:
  - Legal and compliance risk (disparate treatment, potential disparate impact via proxy).
  - Erodes validity of “cultural fit,” which should be job-related and consistently scored.
  - Undermines trust and perceived fairness of the hiring process.

- Better practices:
  - Remove association-based boosts; limit features to validated, job-related criteria.
  - Apply identical scoring rules to all candidates; document and justify any adjustments.
  - Monitor with fairness audits (e.g., threshold sensitivity, counterfactual checks) to ensure decisions don’t hinge on non-merit factors.
