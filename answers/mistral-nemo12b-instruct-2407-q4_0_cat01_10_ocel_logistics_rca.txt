Based on the provided directly follows graph, here are some process and data-specific considerations that could contribute to performance issues:

1. **Frequent item out of stock events**: The high frequency of "item out of stock" -> "reorder item" (1078 events) and "confirm order" -> "item out of stock" (895 events) suggests that there might be inventory management issues leading to frequent stockouts. This could cause delays in fulfilling orders, impacting overall process performance.

2. **Long duration for certain transitions**: Some transitions have significantly longer durations compared to others:
   - "pay order" -> "pick item": 429073.36 seconds (approx. 5 days)
   - "package delivered" -> "payment reminder": 1127921.43 seconds (approx. 13 days)
   These long durations could indicate inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the process, such as slow payment processing or delayed package delivery.

3. **High frequency of certain events**: High frequencies for some events might indicate a need for optimization:
   - "pick item" -> "pay order": 777 events
   - "confirm order" -> "pay order": 632 events
   These frequent payments could suggest a need to streamline the payment process or consider automation where possible.

4. **Low frequency of certain transitions**: Some critical transitions have relatively low frequencies, which might indicate inefficiencies:
   - "place order" -> "create package": 1915 events (items)
   - "confirm order" -> "create package": 760 events (items), 688 events (products)
   These low frequencies could suggest that there's room for improvement in order processing and package creation.

5. **Frequent loops**: Some object types have frequent loops, such as:
   - "pick item" -> "pick item" (employees: 4545 events, products: 1018 events)
   These loops might indicate unnecessary steps or inefficiencies in the process that could be eliminated or optimized.

To improve performance, consider addressing these specific issues by optimizing inventory management, reducing processing times for critical transitions, automating frequent payment processes, and eliminating unnecessary loops.
