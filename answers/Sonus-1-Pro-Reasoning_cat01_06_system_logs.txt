Process Mining Event Log Transformation
Step-by-Step Transformation and Explanation
Data Transformation:

Convert the raw system log into an event log format.
Each event will have a Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp.
Case Identification:

Group events based on the document or task being performed.
Each document or task will be a separate case.
Activity Naming:

Translate raw low-level actions into higher-level process steps.
Use consistent and meaningful activity names.
Event Attributes:

Include Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp.
Additional attributes can be included if useful.
Coherent Narrative:

Ensure the event log tells a coherent story of user work sessions.

Coherent Narrative
The event log tells a coherent story of the user's work session, starting with opening and editing different documents, handling emails, reviewing a report, updating a budget, and finally closing the documents. Each case represents a logical unit of work, and the activities within each case are standardized to provide a clear and meaningful process flow for analysis.
