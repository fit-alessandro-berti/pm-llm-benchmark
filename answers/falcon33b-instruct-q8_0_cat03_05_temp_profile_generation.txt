This Python dictionary represents a temporal profile for the high-tech electronics manufacturing process. Each key is a tuple of activity pairs, and each value is a tuple containing the average time and standard deviation between these activities in days. The values are estimated based on typical durations and variability in such supply chain processes. Note that these times are illustrative and should be adjusted according to specific operational data or empirical analysis for precise process modeling.
