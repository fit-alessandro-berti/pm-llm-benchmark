Below you will find two POWL models:

- **Model 1: With Potential Unfairness** — contains an XOR choice between a standard cultural fit check and a community affiliation check giving advantage to specific groups.
- **Model 2: Without Unfairness** — only the standard cultural fit check is present, ensuring the same evaluation for all.

I've matched the steps from your description to the following activity labels:
- "ReceiveApplication"
- "DataCompletenessCheck" (the first automated completeness pass)
- "RequestMoreInfo" (the loop branch to ask for more info if data is missing)
- "SkillAssessment"
- "CulturalFitCheck" (the standard values/culture evaluation)
- "CommunityAffiliationCheck" (the route that gives advantage to affiliated applicants; only in **Model 1**)
- "ManagerialReview"
- "FinalDecision"

Below are the POWL representations in Python-like pseudocode.

## 1\. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
comm_affil = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Data completeness loop: after check, either go on or request more info and return
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_info]
)

# XOR branch after skill assessment: standard fit OR privileged community check
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[
        cultural_fit,           # Standard path
        comm_affil              # Special path that subtly improves chance
    ]
)

# Full process as partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_xor, manager_review, final_decision]
)

root.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_xor)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, manager_review)
root.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

## 2\. POWL Model Without Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities (same as above except no separate community branch)
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")    # Only this path
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Data completeness loop
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_info]
)

# No XOR here: all go through the same cultural fit check
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_fit, manager_review, final_decision]
)

root.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
root.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

---

**Summary of the difference:**  
- In Model 1, the **XOR** at the cultural fit stage allows some applicants to get a privileged route (potential unfairness).
- In Model 2, *all* applicants experience the same **CulturalFitCheck**, removing the source of possible bias.
