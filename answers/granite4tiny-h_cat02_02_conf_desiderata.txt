**Part 1: Violations of Normative Rules**

To identify cases violating the normative rules, we need to ensure that each step follows the prescribed sequence and order without skipping or reversing steps.

1. **Case ID: 2**
   - **Violation:** The process skips the Credit Check before performing a Risk Assessment.
     - *Explanation:* According to the normative constraints, "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment," but in Case ID: 2, the Risk Assessment occurs without completing the Credit Check first. This violates the required order of activities.

**Summary for Normative Rule Violations:**  
- **Case ID: 2** fails due to skipping the mandatory Credit Check step and performing Risk Assessment out of sequence.

**Part 2: Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions**

Next, we identify cases that do not adhere strictly but ideally should follow certain recommendations:

1. **Case ID: 3**
   - **Violation:** The applicant is informed approximately 14 days after the loan decision.
     - *Explanation:* While not a hard rule, adhering to the "inform promptly" guideline (within 48 hours) suggests that Case ID: 3's delay of about two weeks violates this desideratum. However, it may be due to longer processing times outside documented steps or administrative delays.
   
   - **Violation:** The documentation is finalized approximately a week after loan approval.
     - *Explanation:* According to the recommendation, finalizing documentation immediately following approval would ideally occur sooner (often within hours). Finalizing this late indicates non-adherence to promptness in step closure but doesn't prevent case closure.

**Summary for Desiderata Failures:**  
- **Case ID: 3** fails on timing recommendations related to informing and documenting processes, highlighting suboptimal efficiency but not critical rule breach.

**Justifications/Interpretations:**

1. For Case ID: 2's violation, the organization might be experiencing unexpected delays due to manual review requirements or system issues that temporarily bypass standard procedural flows.
   
2. Case ID: 3’s timeline for notifications and documentation reflects possible operational constraints like staffing shortages or backlog processing times. These do not fundamentally breach organizational protocols but indicate room for improvement in process pacing.

---

**Conclusion:**  
- **Case ID: 2** strictly violates normative rules due to a sequence error.
- **Case ID: 3** shows deviations primarily in timing desiderata, indicating opportunities for efficiency enhancements without violating core contractual steps. 

These observations highlight areas where adherence could improve operational responsiveness and follow-through consistency while maintaining regulatory compliance within established guidelines.
