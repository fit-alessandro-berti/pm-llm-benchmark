Anomalies found in the DECLARE specification

1. Mutual exclusion vs. life-cycle completeness  
   - Constraint “`E` and `C` must never coexist” (`noncoexistence: E  C`) blocks the canonical path because every complete claim must pass through Evaluation (`E`) and later be Closed (`C`).  
   - The same model simultaneously demands that every trace contain a Close (`existence: C`). Therefore every legal trace is forced to violate either the completeness rule (`C` required) or the mutual-exclusion rule (`E` and `C` together forbidden).

2. Precedence is redundant and misleading  
   - `C` is already required to be preceded by `R` (`precedence: C  R`).  
   - The `init` rule already guarantees that `R` is the very first activity, so any later `C` will automatically come after `R`. The precedence rule adds no value while cluttering the model.

3. Responded-existence is too weak for the intended business flow  
   - The model only states “if `E` occurs then `A` must occur somewhere”. It does not prevent `E` from appearing before `A`, allowing a claim to be evaluated before an adjuster is assigned, or even evaluated when no adjuster is assigned at all.

Likely reasons the anomalies were introduced

A. Piece-wise policy editing  
   A new regulation introduced the “no evaluation after closure” safety rule (`E  C`) without checking that the canonical flow already used both activities in sequence.

B. Over-generalisation from a happy path  
   The miner or analyst saw that in most historical traces `E` and `C` never appeared together (because `E` is always earlier) and mis-read this as a hard mutual-exclusion constraint.

C. Attempt to allow “fast-track” closure  
   Pressure to shorten cycle time may have encouraged a rule that lets a claim be closed immediately, skipping evaluation; the `noncoexistence` constraint was added to formalise the skip, forgetting that `existence: C` still forces at least one close event—producing the contradiction.

D. Data quality problems  
   Missing or mis-labelled events in the log could make `E` and `C` look mutually exclusive when they are not, leading the algorithm to generate the spurious rule.

SQL-based reality checks

1. Claims that contain `C` but never contained `E`  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events e
    WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
    AND e.activity = 'C'
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events e
    WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
    AND e.activity = 'E'
);
```

2. Traces where `E` and `C` both occur (violates `noncoexistence`)  
```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E','C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2;
```

3. Evaluation events that precede the assignment of an adjuster  
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events ca
    WHERE ca.claim_id = ce.claim_id
    AND ca.activity = 'A'
    AND ca.timestamp < ce.timestamp
);
```

4. Claims closed without any preceding assignment  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events clo
  ON clo.claim_id = c.claim_id
 AND clo.activity = 'C'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claimEvents a
    WHERE a.claim_id = c.claim_id
    AND a.activity = 'A'
    AND a.timestamp < clo.timestamp
);
```

5. Overall pattern: position of first `E` vs. first `C`  
```sql
SELECT claim_id,
       min(CASE WHEN activity='E' THEN timestamp END) AS first_eval,
       min(CASE WHEN activity='C' THEN timestamp END) AS first_close
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E','C')
GROUP BY claim_id;
```
A result row where `first_eval`  `first_close` shows `E` concurrent with or after `C`, confirming the anomaly in practice.
