The provided visualization is a comprehensive representation of a business process (likely within a healthcare context) modeled using "proclet classes" (process objects), supplemented by a structural class diagram and an example of inter-process communication (a performative).

The visualization is broken down into three main sections:

---

## (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels

This section displays a workflow model, resembling a Petri net or BPMN diagram, detailing the interactions between two parallel process flows: **Lab visit** and **Lab test**.

### Lab Visit Proclet (Left Side)
This process represents the patient-facing activities, primarily driven by a **doctor** and a **lab assistant**:
1.  The process starts with **Order entry** (by the doctor).
2.  The **lab assistant** performs **Take blood sample**.
3.  A decision point leads to **Receive result** (a gray-colored input activity).
4.  The **lab assistant** performs **Judge results** (highlighted in green).
    *   If results are judged **Everything fine**, the lab assistant proceeds to **Send report** and the process terminates.
    *   If results indicate an issue, the process follows the **Do tests again** path (a gray-colored action).
5.  If tests are redone, the process loops through **Receive updated result** before proceeding to **Send report**.

### Lab Test Proclet (Right Side)
This process represents the technical laboratory work, primarily driven by a **chemical analyst**:
1.  The process is initiated by the order system and the **chemical analyst** performs the initial **Perform test**.
2.  The analyst then performs **Make report**.
3.  A merging point occurs. The process may conclude with **Finish lab test** (gray-colored output activity).
4.  Alternatively, if retesting is required, the analyst performs **Perform test again** and then **Provide updated report**.

### Channels and Communication
The two proclets communicate via three shared systems, represented by dashed boxes:

1.  **Order system:** Connects the initial **Order entry** in the "Lab visit" to the start of the "Lab test" process.
2.  **HIS (Hospital Information System):** Connects the "Lab test" output to the "Receive result" input in the "Lab visit."
3.  Additional communication channels are shown connecting activities like **Do tests again** and **Receive updated result** in the "Lab visit" to the retesting activities in the "Lab test" proclet.

The flow lines associated with these channels include multiplicity constraints (e.g., `(1,1)` or `(1,*)`), indicating the number of messages or instances involved in the communication.

## (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes

This is a simple UML Class Diagram illustrating the structural relationship between the two main entities:
*   The class **Lab visit** has a relationship labeled **requires** with the class **Lab test**.
*   The cardinality shows that one **Lab visit** (1..1) requires one or more **Lab test** instances (1..*).

## (c) Example of a performative

This section provides a tabular example detailing a specific communication message (a "performative") that occurs between the proclets:

| Time | Channel | Sender | Receivers | Action | Content | Scope | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 11:00 | Order system | Lab visit - John | Lab test - HGB John | Create | Can you perform a HGB test for John? | Private | OUT |

This table illustrates that at 11:00, the `Lab visit` instance for patient John sends an outgoing (`OUT`) message via the `Order system` channel to initiate a specific `Lab test` (HGB test) instance for John, using the action `Create` and requesting the test be performed.
