This visualization depicts a multi-lane Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the workflow for handling customer orders, production, procurement, and warehousing. The process spans four distinct functional areas (pools): Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

Here is a detailed description of the process flow across the lanes:

---

### 1. Sales Lane (Order Initiation and Invoicing)

The process is initiated by a time event: **"Monday morning."**

1.  **Order Validation:** The sales team first checks the order for completeness.
2.  **Customer Check:** A decision gateway checks if the customer is already in the database.
    *   If the customer is **not** in the database, the flow proceeds through a subprocess where the order is checked, and the new customer is **"Add customer to the database"** (interacting with a database data object).
    *   If the customer **is** in the database, the flow bypasses the addition step.
3.  **Handoff:** After validation, the sales team proceeds to **"Send order details"** (using a message flow indicated by the dashed arrow labeled "Order details") to the Production and Procurement lanes.
4.  **Completion:** The sales process continues with an intermediate event for **"Product sent"** (likely a signal received later) and concludes by drafting the **"Draft invoice."**

### 2. Production Lane (Manufacturing)

This lane is activated when **"Order details arrive"** via a message from Sales.

1.  **Planning:** The process starts with **"Plan production."**
2.  **Material Check/Decision:** A decision gateway follows planning, implying a check on necessary materials or resources.
    *   If the required resources/materials are available and satisfactory (implied by the path leading to manufacturing), the process continues to **"Manufacture product."**
    *   A path labeled **"Material not faulty"** connects back to the decision point before manufacturing, suggesting this check ensures readiness. (Note: The specific logic around the intermediate catching event labeled "Material not faulty" immediately following the planning/decision split suggests a conditional wait or signal handling before the main manufacturing task.)
3.  **Completion Signal:** Once the **"Manufacture product"** task is complete, an intermediate event **"Product complete"** signals both the Warehouse and Procurement lanes.

### 3. Procurement Lane (Material Management)

This lane also receives the initial **"Order details arrive"** message from Sales.

1.  **Material Compensation Subprocess:** Procurement handles sourcing materials within a defined subprocess:
    *   It begins by **"Order materials."**
    *   It includes a looping activity for **"Return material"** (indicated by the loop marker), suggesting handling defective or returned stock.
    *   Finally, the materials are subject to a **"Check materials"** task.
2.  **Order Cancellation/Finalization:** After checking materials, there is a decision point connected to an intermediate event **"Order cancellation."** This suggests that if materials cannot be secured or validated correctly, the order process may be terminated here for procurement activities. If successful, the process moves toward the end of this lane's scope.

### 4. Warehouse Lane (Fulfillment)

This lane is activated when it receives the **"Product complete"** signal from Production.

1.  **Fulfillment:** The warehouse executes the task **"Send product."**
2.  **Completion Signal:** Following shipment, an intermediate event **"Product sent"** is triggered, sending a signal/message back to the Sales lane to allow the invoicing process to finalize.

### Summary of Handoffs

The process relies heavily on message flows (dashed lines) to coordinate between departments:

*   **Sales** sends **Order details** to Production and Procurement.
*   **Production** sends **Product complete** signal to Warehouse and Procurement.
*   **Warehouse** sends **Product sent** signal back to Sales.
