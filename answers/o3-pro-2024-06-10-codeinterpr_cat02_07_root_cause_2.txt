1. Which cases are “slow”  
(lead time = time from Submit Claim to Close Claim)

• Case 2001 – 1 h 30 m  
• Case 2002 – 25 h 55 m  
• Case 2003 – 48 h 20 m  
• Case 2004 – 1 h 25 m  
• Case 2005 – 77 h 05 m  

If we treat anything that lasts 24 h as a performance issue, the problematic cases are:

• 2002 (1 day)  
• 2003 (2 days)  
• 2005 (3¼ days)  

2. Attribute patterns behind the long cases  

a. Complexity  
• Low-complexity claims (2001, 2004) finish in <2 h.  
• The only Medium case (2002) already needs >1 day.  
• Both High cases (2003, 2005) exceed 2 days.  

Correlation: Higher complexity  longer lead time.  

b. “Request Additional Documents” frequency  
• Low: 0 requests  
• Medium (2002): 1 request  
• High (2003): 2 requests  
• High (2005): 3 requests  

Each extra request inserts customer-waiting time (hours or days).  
The count of document requests explains most of the elapsed time.  

c. Adjuster (resource handling the evaluation & doc requests)  
• Short cases: Adjuster_Mike (Low) and Adjuster_Lisa (Low) finish without asking for extra docs.  
• Long cases:  
– Adjuster_Lisa makes 1 request on a Medium claim (2002) and 3 requests on a High claim (2005).  
– Adjuster_Mike makes 2 requests on a High claim (2003).  

Possible cause: both adjusters split information needs across several separate requests instead of asking once, or they wait long before raising the first request.  

d. Approving manager  
• Fast approvals (<1 h after docs complete) when Manager_Ann signs (all Low + Medium case).  
• Slow approvals (1 day after last doc arrives) when Manager_Bill signs (both High cases).  

Manager_Bill seems to be a bottleneck for complex claims.  

e. Region  
• Region A: one fast (2001) and one slow (2003) case.  
• Region B: one fast (2004) and two slow (2002, 2005).  

Region alone is not decisive; complexity and resource choice matter more.  

3. Likely root causes and mitigation ideas  

Root cause 1 – High complexity  fragmented information gathering  
• Why: Complex policies require many documents; adjusters discover gaps late and send multiple, serial requests.  
• Mitigation:  
– Provide an upfront “complete document checklist” generated automatically from policy type.  
– Add a rule in the BPMS: only one ‘Request Additional Documents’ activity is allowed; adjuster must compile all needs before sending.  
– Offer decisionsupport screens so adjusters see which documents are still missing in real time.  

Root cause 2 – Adjuster behaviour (Lisa & Mike)  
• Why: They wait hours before the first request and issue several partial requests.  
• Mitigation:  
– Training on first-time-right assessment.  
– Peer reviews after evaluation to ensure completeness before the claim leaves the adjuster’s queue.  
– KPI: “# document requests per claim” and “time from Evaluate Claim to first request” with dashboards and coaching.  

Root cause 3 – Manager_Bill’s approval delay  
• Why: Only Manager_Bill is allowed to approve high-complexity claims; workload peaks cause >24 h queues.  
• Mitigation:  
– Cross-train other managers (e.g., Manager_Ann) for high complexity.  
– Introduce workload-balancing or automatic routing to the first available qualified manager.  
– Define an SLA: “Approve within 4 business hours after last document received”. Escalate when breached.  

Root cause 4 – Customer response time between document requests  
• Even perfect internal processing cannot avoid waiting for customers, but reducing the number of separate requests (Root cause 1) shrinks this external wait.  
• Offer digital self-service portal where customers can upload all missing files at once and receive immediate confirmation of completeness.  

Quick-win checklist  

1. Add completeness checks in “Evaluate Claim”.  
2. Limit process to max 1 “Request Additional Documents” task.  
3. Share high-complexity approval load among several managers.  
4. Track and publish metrics: total lead time, waiting time per activity, # doc requests per claim, manager approval latency.  

Applying these steps to the present log would have turned cases 2002, 2003 and 2005 into same-day or next-morning completions, matching the performance of the simple low-complexity claims.
