The diagram presents a complex process involving lab visits and lab tests, structured through two interconnected proclet classes. The overall structure includes a series of activities and interactions between different roles such as doctors, lab assistants, and chemical analysts. Key components include 'Lab visit' and 'Lab test,' which are connected through various channels and actions. Lab visits require lab tests, and the process involves multiple steps such as ordering tests, taking blood samples, performing tests, making reports, and sending results. Lab assistants and chemical analysts play crucial roles in these processes. The diagram also includes annotations like 'Order system' and 'HIS,' indicating systems involved in the workflow. The relationships depicted show a sequence of actions and dependencies, with arrows indicating the flow of information and tasks. The overall concept illustrates a detailed workflow in a laboratory setting, highlighting the interactions and dependencies between different tasks and personnel. The diagram effectively conveys the structured and interconnected nature of laboratory processes, emphasizing the importance of each step and role in ensuring accurate and timely test results.
