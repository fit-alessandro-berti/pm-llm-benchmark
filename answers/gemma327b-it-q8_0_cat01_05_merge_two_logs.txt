**Explanation and Reasoning:**

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:** The code first loads the event logs into pandas DataFrames for easier manipulation.  The timestamp columns are converted to datetime objects for accurate time difference calculations.

2. **Timestamp Tolerance:** A `timestamp_tolerance` variable is defined to allow for slight differences in timestamps between the two logs. This is set to 2 seconds, as specified in the prompt.

3. **Merging Logic:**
   - The code iterates through each event in Log A (considered the primary timeline).
   - For each event in Log A, it searches for a matching event in Log B based on `order_id`.
   - If a match is found, it calculates the time difference between the timestamps.
   - If the time difference is within the `timestamp_tolerance`, the events are considered a match and are merged into a single record.  All attributes from both logs are included in the merged record.
   - A `used_b_indices` set is used to prevent the same event in Log B from being matched to multiple events in Log A.
   - If no match is found in Log B within the tolerance, the event from Log A is added to the merged log as-is, with a `source` attribute indicating it originated from Log A.

4. **Handling Events Only in Log B:** After processing Log A, the code iterates through Log B to identify any events that were not matched to events in Log A. These events are added to the merged log as-is, with a `source` attribute indicating they originated from Log B.

5. **Sorting:** The merged log is sorted chronologically based on the `timestamp` attribute.

6. **Output:** The merged log is printed to the console.

**Key Decisions and Considerations:**

* **Log A as Primary:** Log A was chosen as the primary timeline because the prompt stated it was the "primary" timeline.
* **Timestamp Tolerance:** The `timestamp_tolerance` of 2 seconds was chosen based on the prompt's requirements.
* **Attribute Handling:** All attributes from both logs were included in the merged records.  If there were conflicting attribute names, the attributes from Log B were added alongside the existing attributes from Log A.
* **Event Matching:** Event matching was based on `order_id` and timestamp proximity. This approach assumes that events with the same `order_id` and similar timestamps represent the same occurrence.
* **Source Tracking:** The `source` attribute was added to each event to indicate its origin (Log A, Log B, or Merged). This helps to understand how the events were processed.
* **Handling Naming Variations:** The code doesn't explicitly handle event name variations.  It relies on the timestamp and `order_id` for matching.  More sophisticated matching could involve fuzzy string matching of event names.
