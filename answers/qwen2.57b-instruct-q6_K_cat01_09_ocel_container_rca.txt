To identify potential root causes for performance issues based on the provided directly follows graph, we need to focus on high frequencies of certain events that take a long duration or have a large number of objects involved. Here are some key points to consider:

### Handling Unit

1. **"Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal":**
   - Frequency: 6 occurrences
   - Duration: 84,119.09 seconds (over 23 hours)
   - This suggests a significant delay in moving the truck from loading to the terminal, which could be due to traffic, scheduling issues, or infrastructure constraints.

### Truck

1. **"Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal":**
   - Frequency: 1,989 occurrences
   - Duration: 10,999.07 seconds (over 3 hours)
   - This event is more frequent and less time-consuming compared to the "Handling Unit". However, if this duration consistently takes over 3 hours, it might still indicate inefficiencies in logistics or scheduling.

2. **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck":**
   - Frequency: 1,988 occurrences
   - Duration: 84,119.09 seconds (over 23 hours)
   - Similar to the first point, this suggests a significant delay in loading trucks at the terminal.

### Container

1. **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Weigh":**
   - Frequency: 1,989 occurrences
   - Duration: 2559.54 seconds (over 7 hours)
   - This indicates a long wait time for weighing containers at the terminal, which might be due to overloading or inefficiencies in weigh station operations.

2. **"Weigh" -> "Place in Stock":**
   - Frequency: 1,814 occurrences
   - Duration: 1960.09 seconds (over 5 hours)
   - Significant time spent placing containers into stock after weighing could indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the warehousing process.

3. **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay":**
   - Frequency: 1,794 occurrences
   - Duration: 743,380.51 seconds (over 206 hours)
   - This is a highly frequent and very long-duration event, suggesting significant delays in moving containers from storage back to the loading bay.

### Vehicle

1. **"Book Vehicles" -> "Reschedule Container":**
   - Frequency: 19 occurrences
   - Duration: 371,476.42 seconds (over 42 days)
   - This is an extremely long duration for a relatively small number of events, indicating that rescheduling containers is a time-consuming process.

### Forklift

1. **"Place in Stock" -> "Weigh":**
   - Frequency: 1,326 occurrences
   - Duration: 26,927.52 seconds (over 7 hours)
   - Significant wait times for weighing containers using a forklift suggest inefficiencies or bottlenecks.

### Customer Order

1. **"Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document":**
   - Frequency: 594 occurrences
   - Duration: 329,005.22 seconds (over 37 days)
   - The registration and creation of transport documents are taking an extremely long time, which could indicate issues with system processing or manual procedures.

### Transport Document

1. **"Create Transport Document" -> "Book Vehicles":**
   - Frequency: 594 occurrences
   - Duration: 22,207.07 seconds (over 6 hours)
   - This is a significant duration for the creation of transport documents and booking vehicles, suggesting potential bottlenecks.

### Summary of Root Causes

1. **Long Delays at Terminals:** Events like "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" and similar show prolonged durations, indicating possible inefficiencies in terminal operations or logistics.
2. **Bottlenecks in Warehousing:** Significant wait times for placing containers in stock ("Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay") suggest issues with storage area management or movement within the warehouse.
3. **System Processing Delays:** High durations for document creation and booking vehicles indicate potential system processing issues or manual workflow inefficiencies.

These points highlight specific areas where performance improvements could be targeted to address the identified bottlenecks and delays.
