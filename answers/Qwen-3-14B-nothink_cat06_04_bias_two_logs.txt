The comparison between **Group A (Protected Group)** and **Group B (Unprotected Group)** event logs reveals **systematic bias** in the **final decisions** based on the **CommunityGroup** and **LocalResident** attributes. This bias manifests in the **score adjustment** and **final approval rates** between the two groups.

---

###  **Key Observations and Analysis**

#### 1. **LocalResident Attribute**
- **Group A (Protected Group):** All cases have `LocalResident = FALSE`.
- **Group B (Unprotected Group):** All cases have `LocalResident = TRUE`.

This is a clear distinction in the data. The **LocalResident** attribute appears to be a proxy for **geographic or demographic identity**. Since Group A is the **protected group**, the bias may be related to how the system treats **non-local residents** versus **local residents**.

---

#### 2. **CommunityGroup Attribute**
- **Group A:** `CommunityGroup = None` for all cases.
- **Group B:** `CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club` for some cases, and `None` for others.

In **Group B**, the **CommunityGroup** is **explicitly used to apply a score adjustment** (i.e., a **+10 point boost**). This is **not the case in Group A**, where no such adjustment is applied, and all preliminary scores remain unchanged.

This indicates that **CommunityGroup membership** is being used to **adjust scores in favor of Group B (Unprotected Group)**, but not for Group A (Protected Group). This is a **form of algorithmic bias**, as it introduces a **systematic advantage** to one group over the other.

---

#### 3. **Score Adjustment**
- **Group A:** No score adjustment is applied in any case (`ScoreAdjustment = 0` or `N/A`).
- **Group B:** Cases in the **Highland Civic Darts Club** receive a **+10 point boost** to their **PreliminaryScore**, resulting in an **adjusted score** used for review.

This **score adjustment** is a **clearly biased mechanism**. It gives **automatic advantage** to members of a specific community group, which may not be justified or transparently explained. This can lead to **unequal treatment** of similar cases based on **arbitrary group membership**.

---

#### 4. **Final Decision Outcomes**
Let’s compare the **approval rates**:

| Group | Cases | Approved | Rejected | Approval Rate |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|---------------|
| A     | 3     | 2        | 1        | 66.7%         |
| B     | 3     | 2        | 1        | 66.7%         |

At first glance, the **approval rate is equal** between the two groups. However, this **masking effect** hides the **systematic advantage** given to Group B via the **CommunityGroup-based score adjustment**.

For example:
- **U002** in Group B had a **PreliminaryScore of 710**, which was **not adjusted**, and was **rejected**.
- **P002** in Group A had a **PreliminaryScore of 710**, with **no adjustment**, and was also **rejected**.
- **U003** in Group B had a **PreliminaryScore of 695**, but received a **+10 boost**, leading to an **adjusted score of 705**, and was **approved**.
- **P001** in Group A had a **PreliminaryScore of 720**, with **no adjustment**, and was **approved**.

So, **U003** (Group B) was **approved** despite a **lower preliminary score** than **P001** (Group A), due to the **CommunityGroup-based score adjustment**.

This suggests that **Group B (Unprotected Group)** is being **systematically advantaged** in the decision process, even though the **approval rates appear equal**.

---

###  **How Bias Manifests**
- **Score Adjustment Bias:** Group B receives **automatic score boosts** based on **CommunityGroup** membership, while Group A does not. This **skews the final decision** in favor of Group B.
- **LocalResident Bias:** Group A is composed entirely of **non-local residents**, and they are not given any **score adjustment** or **special consideration**, unlike Group B.
- **Systemic Advantage:** The **CommunityGroup-based score adjustment** is not applied to Group A, which may be a **protected group**, and this leads to **unequal treatment** in the decision-making process.

---

###  **Conclusion**
**Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits **algorithmic bias** in the event log. This bias manifests through:
- **Automatic score adjustments** for members of **specific community groups**.
- **Lack of such adjustments** for Group A (Protected Group), despite similar or lower **PreliminaryScores**.
- **Unequal treatment** in the final decision process, even though approval rates appear equal.

This suggests that the **CommunityGroup** and **LocalResident** attributes are being used to **systematically favor one group over another**, potentially violating principles of **fairness and non-discrimination** in algorithmic decision-making.
