Based on the event log, I have identified **four distinct activity phases** by analyzing patterns in sensor readings over time. Each phase corresponds to a meaningful manufacturing activity, inferred from characteristic combinations of temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption.

##  **Labeled Activities with Rationale**

---

### **1. Machine Idle / Standby (Events #1–3 and #13–15)**

**Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15  
**Timestamps:** 08:00:00–08:00:10 and 08:01:00–08:01:10  
**Sensor Profile:**
- Temperature: ~20–21°C (ambient)
- Pressure: 1 bar (baseline)
- Vibration: 0 Hz (no movement)
- Material Flow: 0 units/s (no material moving)
- Tool Position: 0 mm (retracted/home)
- Energy: ~0.4–0.5 kWh (minimal baseline power)

**Assigned Label:** **“Machine Idle / Standby”**

**Rationale:**
All sensor values are at baseline or near-zero, indicating no active processing. The machine is powered on (low energy draw) but not performing any physical work. This is typical before startup and after shutdown of an operation cycle.

---

### **2. Material Feeding & Tool Positioning (Events #4–6)**

**Events:** 4, 5, 6  
**Timestamps:** 08:00:15–08:00:25  
**Sensor Profile:**
- Temperature: Rising from 50°C  58°C
- Pressure: Slight increase to 1.5 bar
- Vibration: Rising from 30 Hz  38 Hz
- Material Flow: Steady at 5 units/s
- Tool Position: Moving from 5mm  10mm
- Energy: Rising from 2.0  3.0 kWh

**Assigned Label:** **“Material Feeding & Tool Positioning”**

**Rationale:**
This phase shows coordinated increases in vibration, temperature, and energy—consistent with mechanical motion and material being fed into the work zone. The tool is advancing (5mm  10mm), and material is flowing steadily, suggesting preparation for an operation (e.g., aligning parts or feeding raw material). The absence of extreme heat or vibration rules out cutting or welding at this stage.

---

### **3. High-Intensity Operation — Likely “Welding” (Events #7–9)**

**Events:** 7, 8, 9  
**Timestamps:** 08:00:30–08:00:40  
**Sensor Profile:**
- Temperature: Jumps to 80°C (peak)
- Pressure: Stable at 2 bar
- Vibration: Drops to 10 Hz, then spikes to 50 Hz
- Material Flow: Drops to 0 at event #9
- Tool Position: Fixed at 15mm
- Energy: Peaks at 5.0 kWh

**Assigned Label:** **“Welding”**

**Rationale:**
The sudden temperature spike (to 80°C), fixed tool position, cessation of material flow, and very high energy consumption (5.0 kWh) strongly suggest a localized, high-energy process like **welding**. The vibration spike at event #9 may correspond to arcing or electrode contact. The stable pressure and fixed tool position indicate the machine is holding steady during a thermal joining process—not cutting or moving parts.

> *Alternative consideration: Could be “Heating” or “Curing,” but the sharp energy and vibration spike, combined with no material flow, better matches welding in a discrete manufacturing context.*

### **4. Cool Down & Part Ejection / Reset (Events #10–12)**

**Events:** 10, 11, 12  
**Timestamps:** 08:00:45–08:00:55  
**Sensor Profile:**
- Temperature: Cooling from 80°C  25°C
- Pressure: Drops to 1 bar
- Vibration: Low (1–5 Hz)
- Material Flow: Resumes at 1 unit/s (slow)
- Tool Position: Advances to 20mm
- Energy: Moderate (~1.5–1.6 kWh)

**Assigned Label:** **“Cool Down & Part Ejection / Reset”**

**Rationale:**
Temperature drops rapidly, indicating passive or active cooling. The tool moves further (15mm  20mm), possibly to eject a finished part or reset for the next cycle. Low material flow (1 unit/s) may represent removal of scrap or feeding of a new fixture. Energy remains moderate, suggesting mechanical movement without high thermal load. This phase prepares the machine to return to standby.

##  **Inferred Process Flow:**

1. **Machine Idle / Standby**  
     
2. **Material Feeding & Tool Positioning**  
     
3. **Welding**  
     
4. **Cool Down & Part Ejection / Reset**  
     
5. **Return to Idle**

This represents one complete cycle of a discrete manufacturing operation on Machine M1, likely involving joining or assembly with a thermal process.

 **Conclusion:**

Using process mining principles—specifically, clustering events by sensor behavior patterns and mapping them to physical interpretations—I have successfully inferred and labeled four distinct manufacturing activities from unlabeled numeric data. This reconstructed process model can now be used for performance analysis, anomaly detection, or workflow optimization.
