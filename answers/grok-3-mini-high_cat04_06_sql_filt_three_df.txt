First, I need to identify cases that have the sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed directly by 'Create Order', followed directly by 'Confirm Order', with no other events in between for that case. Then, among those cases, I need to find where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence is more than 5 days. Finally, I have to exclude all events from those cases and return the rest.

The key is to find cases that have this exact subsequence with no interruptions. In SQL, especially in DuckDB, I might need to use window functions or self-joins to check for consecutive events.

One way to check for consecutive activities is to use row numbering or lead/lag functions to see the order of activities per case.

I should start by ordering the events per case by timestamp, since the sequence must be in order and direct succession means no events in between.

So, perhaps I can add a row number to each event per case, ordered by timestamp.

Then, for each event, I can check the activity and the activity of the next row (using LEAD or LAG), but since I need a sequence of three, I might need to check for triples.

I can look for events where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and the next event (in terms of row number) is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

Since the row number is based on timestamp order, consecutive row numbers mean consecutive events in time for that case.

Assuming that timestamps are unique per case or at least ordered correctly, but timestamps might not be unique if multiple events at same time, but probably we assume they are ordered.

In process mining, events are often ordered by timestamp, and if timestamps are equal, maybe by some other order, but for simplicity, I'll assume that ordering by timestamp gives the correct sequence.

So, in DuckDB, I can use window functions.

First, I can create a CTE or subquery that adds a row number per case.

Something like:

WITH ordered_events AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn

    FROM event_log

)

Now, in this ordered_events, for each row, I can find the activity at rn, rn+1, rn+2.

But I need to find rows where activity at rn is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', at rn+1 is 'Create Order', and at rn+2 is 'Confirm Order'.

Since it's the same case, I can group by case or find such triples.

One way is to select rows where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) = 'Create Order' and LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) = 'Confirm Order'.

LEAD function can be used with offset.

In the same CTE or another one, I can add lead activities.

Define another CTE:

WITH ordered_events AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn

    FROM event_log

),

events_with_lead AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        rn,

        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_activity,

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_next_activity,

        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_timestamp,

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_next_timestamp

    FROM ordered_events

)

In this events_with_lead, I can filter for rows where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and next_activity = 'Create Order' and next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'.

This will give me the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' events that are followed directly by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order'.

Each such row corresponds to a case that has this sequence starting at that point.

A case might have multiple such sequences, but for the condition, as long as there is at least one such sequence, and then we check the time condition.

The time condition is between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' of that sequence.

In this filter, when I find such a row, the 'Create Order' timestamp is next_timestamp, and 'Confirm Order' timestamp is next_next_timestamp.

From the LEAD, LEAD(timestamp,1) is the timestamp of the next event, which is 'Create Order', and LEAD(timestamp,2) is the timestamp of the event two steps ahead, which is 'Confirm Order'.

So, for each such row where the sequence is found, I can calculate the time difference between next_timestamp and next_next_timestamp.

next_timestamp is 'Create Order', next_next_timestamp is 'Confirm Order', so the difference should be more than 5 days.

But the difference is between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', which are consecutive in this sequence, but since there are no events in between, the time difference is just between these two events.

In the sequence, 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' with no events in between, so the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is directly computable.

In the filter, I can find rows where:

activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND next_activity = 'Create Order'

AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

The condition is time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' more than 5 days.

next_next_timestamp is 'Confirm Order', next_timestamp is 'Create Order', so yes.

In DuckDB, timestamp differences can be handled with INTERVAL.

Assuming timestamp is TIMESTAMP type, then next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp gives an INTERVAL, and I can compare to INTERVAL '5 days'.

Yes.

Now, this filter will give me rows (specifically, the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' events) that satisfy the sequence and the time condition.

But each such row is tied to a case_id.

Now, the cases that have at least one such sequence with the time condition >5 days need to be identified.

So, from this filtered set, I can select distinct case_id that have such rows.

Let me define a CTE for the bad cases.

WITH ordered_events AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn

    FROM event_log

),

events_with_lead AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        rn,

        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_activity,

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_next_activity,

        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_timestamp,

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_next_timestamp

    FROM ordered_events

),

sequence_found AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        next_timestamp AS create_order_timestamp,  -- for reference, but maybe not needed

        next_next_timestamp AS confirm_order_timestamp,

        (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) AS time_diff

    FROM events_with_lead

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'

      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

      AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

)

In sequence_found, I have case_id and the time_diff, but I just need the case_id that have at least one such row.

So, I can do:

bad_cases AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT case_id

    FROM sequence_found

)

sequence_found already has the filter for time_diff > 5 days.

In the WHERE clause, I have the sequence and time condition.

So bad_cases is the set of case_id that have at least one instance of the sequence with time >5 days.

Now, I need to exclude all events from these bad_cases.

So, the final query should select all from event_log where case_id not in (select case_id from bad_cases)

But I need to return all events except those in bad cases.

Yes.

In the bad_cases, I defined it based on sequence_found, which is correct.

In the LEAD function, I used LEAD over PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn, which is fine, since rn is already ordered.

rn is row number, so ordering by rn is redundant if rn is consecutive, but it's okay.

I could order by timestamp directly in the LEAD, but since I have rn, it's fine.

To make it cleaner, I can combine the CTEs.

I need to handle the case where LEAD might be NULL, but in the WHERE clause, when I check next_activity and next_next_activity, if they are NULL, the equality will be false, so it should be okay, as long as the sequence exists up to the end.

If a case has only two events, LEAD with offset 2 might be NULL, so the condition will filter them out, which is correct.

Similarly for the end of the case.

Now, the final output should be all events from event_log where the case_id is not in the bad_cases.

So, I can write:

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (

    SELECT DISTINCT case_id

    FROM events_with_lead

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'

      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

      AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

)

I don't need the intermediate CTEs in the subquery, but I need the leads.

In the NOT IN subquery, I need to compute the leads.

So, perhaps it's better to use a CTE for the whole thing.

Since DuckDB supports CTEs, I can define the CTEs and then use them.

In the subquery, I can compute everything.

But to make it clear, I'll use CTEs.

So, full query:

WITH ordered_events AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn

    FROM event_log

),

events_with_lead AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        rn,

        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_activity,  -- offset 1 by default

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_next_activity,

        LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_timestamp,

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_next_timestamp

    FROM ordered_events

),

bad_cases AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT case_id

    FROM events_with_lead

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'

      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

      AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

)

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases)

In the LEAD function, I specified LEAD(activity) which is LEAD with offset 1, and LEAD(activity, 2), etc.

In DuckDB, the syntax should be fine.

Now, the final select is from event_log, and it should return all columns, which it does with SELECT *.

The prompt says "return all events from `event_log` except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and the timing condition."

Yes.

It also says "ensure proper grouping, ordering, and filtering", but in this case, I'm not grouping or ordering the final output, but probably it's fine, as the result should just be the filtered events, perhaps in no particular order, unless specified.

The prompt doesn't specify any order for the output, so SELECT * with the WHERE clause should be okay.

To be precise, maybe I should order by case_id and timestamp, but it's not required.

Now, one thing: in the bad_cases, I'm selecting distinct case_id where there is at least one such sequence with time >5 days.

A case might have multiple sequences, but as long as one satisfies, it's bad and should be excluded entirely.

Yes, that's correct.

The condition is to exclude cases that have the sequence with the time condition, not that all sequences must satisfy or something.

Yes.

Now, about the time difference: I used (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

In DuckDB, timestamp subtraction should give an INTERVAL, and comparison should work.

I think DuckDB supports that.

To be safe, I could use DATEDIFF or something, but INTERVAL should be fine.

In DuckDB, timestamp difference might return an INTERVAL, and you can compare.

Yes.

Now, another thing: the sequence must be in direct succession, which is handled by the consecutive row numbers via LEAD.

Since I'm using row number ordered by timestamp, and assuming no ties or that the order is correct.

If there are multiple events at the same timestamp, the row number might be arbitrary, but probably in process logs, timestamps are unique or ordered correctly.

I'll assume it's fine.

To handle possible timestamp ties, I might need to add another column to order by, but since it's not specified, I'll proceed.

Now, the final query seems correct.

In the CTE, I have ordered_events with rn, and then events_with_lead.

I could combine them into one CTE.

For example:

WITH events_with_lead AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,

        LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp

    FROM event_log

)

Then, bad_cases as before.

I don't need the row number, since I can order directly by timestamp in the LEAD function.

Yes, better, no need for intermediate row number.

So, simplify:

WITH events_with_lead AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,

        LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp

    FROM event_log

),

bad_cases AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT case_id

    FROM events_with_lead

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'

      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

      AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

)

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases)

Yes.

To make it a single query without CTEs, but CTEs are fine and more readable.

Now, I think this should work.

The prompt says "return all events", so SELECT * is fine.

Also, ensure that the table is named event_log, which it is.

I think this covers the requirements.
