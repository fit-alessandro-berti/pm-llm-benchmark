The image presents a comprehensive flowchart and data table illustrating the interactions between various entities in a laboratory setting. Here is a detailed description of the visualization:

### **Flowchart Description**

The flowchart, labeled **(a)**, depicts two **prolet classes** (Lab visit and Lab test) connected through two channels. These prolets represent **"Lab visit"** and **"Lab test"** processes.

- **Lab visit Prolet**: 
  - Initiates the process with the **"Order system"** sending a request for a lab test.
  - The **doctor** places an order via the **"Order entry"** process.
  - A **lab assistant** takes a blood sample and **judges the results**.
  - If everything is fine, they send the report; otherwise, they perform additional tests.

- **Lab test Prolet**: 
  - The **chemical analyst** performs the lab test and creates a report.
  - If the test requires re-evaluation (e.g., abnormal results), the process loops back for further testing.

**Key Processes**:
- **Order entry**: The doctor initiates a lab order.
- **Take blood sample**: The lab assistant collects the sample.
- **Judge results**: The results are evaluated; if they are abnormal, additional tests are conducted.

### **Class Diagram**

The **class diagram** (b) shows the relationship between **Lab visit** and **Lab test**, indicating that a Lab visit **requires** one or more Lab tests.

### **Performative Table**

The **table** (c) provides an example of a **performative**, which is a structured message used in the communication between agents. Here are the details:

| Time  | Channel   | Sender       | Receivers  | Action  | Content                  | Scope   | Direction |
|---------|------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| 11:00   | Order     | Lab visit - John | Lab test - HGB | Create  | Can you perform a HGB test for John? | Private | OUT         |

**Explanation**:
- **Time**: 11:00
- **Channel**: Order system
- **Sender**: Lab visit
- **Receivers**: Lab test
- **Action**: Create
- **Content**: Request for an HGB test for John
- **Scope**: Private (restricted to specific entities)
- **Direction**: OUT (outgoing message)

### **Conclusion**

The visualization illustrates a structured process for handling lab tests and interactions between different entities in a healthcare setting. It highlights how orders are placed, samples are analyzed, and results are communicated. The performative example demonstrates how specific actions (like requesting a test) are structured and transmitted. This process ensures that lab tests are ordered, performed, and reported in a coordinated manner.
