### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Identify Potential Bias Points:**
   - Decisions like "Approve" or "Reject" might be biased based on sensitive attributes such as `ApplicantRace` or `ApplicantGender`.
   - Direct transitions from sensitive attribute checks to decisions could lead to biased outcomes.

2. **Add New Coexistence Constraint:**
   - Ensure that any decision involving a minority applicant (`Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`) coexists with a "ManualReview" to introduce fairness.

3. **Add New Succession Constraint:**
   - Enforce that after checking sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`), a "BiasMitigationCheck" must occur before any decision is made.

4. **Add New Non-Succession Constraint:**
   - Prevent direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject` to avoid immediate biased decisions.

5. **Update the `declare_model` Dictionary:**
   - Incorporate the new constraints while maintaining the correct DECLARE structure.

6. **Provide Rationale for Each Added Constraint:**
   - Explain how each constraint contributes to mitigating bias in the process.

### Rationale for Added Constraints

- **Coexistence Constraint:**
  - Ensures that decisions on minority applicants (`Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`) are always accompanied by a "ManualReview," promoting fairness and reducing potential bias in these decisions.

- **Succession Constraint:**
  - Mandates that after checking the applicant's race (`CheckApplicantRace`), a "BiasMitigationCheck" must be performed before reaching a final decision. This introduces an additional step to assess and mitigate any bias that may arise from the sensitive attribute.

- **Non-Succession Constraint:**
  - Prevents the direct transition from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject`, thereby avoiding immediate biased rejections based solely on the applicant's race without proper review.

These added constraints collectively help in ensuring that sensitive attributes do not lead to biased outcomes by enforcing additional checks and reviews, promoting fairness in the loan application process.
