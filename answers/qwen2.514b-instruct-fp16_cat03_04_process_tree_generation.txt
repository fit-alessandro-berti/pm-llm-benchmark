Sure, let's create a more complex scenario for a "Purchase-to-Pay" (P2P) process. A typical P2P process involves activities like Requesting goods/services, Purchasing, Receiving goods/services, Checking the invoice, and finally Paying the supplier.

We'll model this with the following sequence of operations:

1. An initial step where an employee requests for goods or services.
2. Then comes a purchase order that can be processed in two different ways (either directly approved by the manager or reviewed first).
3. After the approval/review, there's an activity related to receiving the goods/services and checking the invoice.
4. The final step is paying the supplier.

We'll use process tree operations for modeling:

- Sequence (`->`): Represents a linear sequence of steps where one must be completed before moving on to the next.
- Choice (`X` or `xor`): Represents an exclusive choice between two paths.
- Parallel (`+`): Represents activities that can occur concurrently in true concurrency.

Here's how we can represent this using Python and `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj`:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Creating the root process tree object for Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process.
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Requesting goods/services:
request_goods_services = ProcessTree(label="Request Goods/Services", parent=root)
root.children.append(request_goods_services)

# After request comes either approval directly or review followed by approval:
approval_path = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)

purchase_order_direct_approve = ProcessTree(label="Purchase Order -> Manager Approves Directly", parent=approval_path)
approval_path.children.append(purchase_order_direct_approve)

review_first_approve_later = ProcessTree(parent=approval_path)
purchase_order_review = ProcessTree(label="Manager Reviews Purchase Order", parent=review_first_approve_later)
review_first_approve_later.children.append(purchase_order_review)
manager_approval_after_review = ProcessTree(label="Manager Approves After Review", parent=review_first_approve_later)
review_first_approve_later.children.append(manager_approval_after_review)

approval_path.children.append(review_first_approve_later)
root.children.append(approval_path)

# Activities that can occur in parallel: Receiving goods/services and checking the invoice.
parallel_activities = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)

receiving_goods_services = ProcessTree(label="Receiving Goods/Services", parent=parallel_activities)
checking_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Checking Invoice", parent=parallel_activities)

parallel_activities.children.append(receiving_goods_services)
parallel_activities.children.append(checking_invoice)
root.children.append(parallel_activities)

# After receiving goods and checking invoice, finally the payment is done.
payment_supplier = ProcessTree(label="Payment to Supplier", parent=root)
root.children.append(payment_supplier)

# Now we have created a process tree that models the Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process.
```

In this model:
- The request for goods/services (`Request Goods/Services`) has to happen first.
- Then, there's an exclusive choice between direct approval by the manager and a review followed by approval of the purchase order.
- In parallel, you can receive goods/services and check the invoice (activities that might run concurrently).
- Finally, once everything is completed, payment is made to the supplier (`Payment to Supplier`).

This process tree effectively captures the essential steps in a simplified Purchase-to-Pay cycle.
