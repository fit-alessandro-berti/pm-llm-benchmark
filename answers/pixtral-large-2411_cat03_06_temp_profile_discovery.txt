To generate a temporal profile for the given process variants, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities that occur in the process traces. Since we don't have the actual timestamps of the activities, we'll use the provided performance data to estimate the times between activities.

Here's a step-by-step approach to generate the temporal profile:

1. **Extract Activity Pairs**: Identify all pairs of activities that occur in the process variants.
2. **Calculate Average and Standard Deviation**: For each pair of activities, calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between them using the performance data.

Given the complexity and the number of process variants, let's focus on a few key pairs to illustrate the process. We'll use the performance data to estimate the times between activities.

### Step 1: Extract Activity Pairs

Let's consider a few key pairs for illustration:
- ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine')
- ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification')
- ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty')
- ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection')
- ('Add penalty', 'Payment')

### Step 2: Calculate Average and Standard Deviation

For simplicity, let's assume the performance data represents the total time for the entire process variant. We'll estimate the time between activities by dividing the performance by the number of steps in the variant.

#### Example Calculation for ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine')

1. Identify variants containing the pair ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'):
   - Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection (frequency = 56482, performance = 59591524.946)
   - Create Fine -> Send Fine (frequency = 20385, performance = 8380516.026)
   - Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment (frequency = 9520, performance = 35037723.025)
   - ... (other variants)

2. Calculate the time between 'Create Fine' and 'Send Fine' for each variant:
   - For the first variant: (59591524.946 / 5 steps) = 11918304.9892 per step
   - For the second variant: (8380516.026 / 2 steps) = 4190258.013 per step
   - For the third variant: (35037723.025 / 5 steps) = 7007544.605 per step
   - ... (repeat for other variants)

3. Calculate the average and standard deviation of these times.

### Temporal Profile Example

Let's assume we have calculated the average and standard deviation for a few pairs:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (86400, 3600),  # Example values
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (3600, 1800),  # Example values
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): (7200, 3600),  # Example values
    ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'): (14400, 7200),  # Example values
    ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): (10800, 5400),  # Example values
    # Add more pairs as needed
}
```

### Full Implementation

To fully implement this, you would need to write a Python script that:
1. Parses the process variants and performance data.
2. Extracts all pairs of activities.
3. Calculates the average and standard deviation for each pair.

Here's a skeleton of the Python script:

```python
import statistics

# Example process variants and performance data
process_variants = [
    {"variant": ["Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty", "Send for Credit Collection"], "frequency": 56482, "performance": 59591524.946},
    {"variant": ["Create Fine", "Payment"], "frequency": 46371, "performance": 889688.400},
    # Add more variants...
]

# Function to calculate temporal profile
def calculate_temporal_profile(process_variants):
    activity_pairs = {}
    for variant in process_variants:
        steps = len(variant["variant"])
        time_per_step = variant["performance"] / steps
        for i in range(steps - 1):
            pair = (variant["variant"][i], variant["variant"][i + 1])
            if pair not in activity_pairs:
                activity_pairs[pair] = []
            activity_pairs[pair].append(time_per_step)

    temporal_profile = {}
    for pair, times in activity_pairs.items():
        avg_time = statistics.mean(times)
        stdev_time = statistics.stdev(times) if len(times) > 1 else 0
        temporal_profile[pair] = (avg_time, stdev_time)

    return temporal_profile

# Calculate the temporal profile
temporal_profile = calculate_temporal_profile(process_variants)
print(temporal_profile)
```

This script will give you a temporal profile based on the provided process variants and performance data. You can extend it to handle more complex cases and larger datasets.
