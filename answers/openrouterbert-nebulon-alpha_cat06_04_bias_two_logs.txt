### **Bias Analysis of Event Logs: Group A (Protected) vs. Group B (Unprotected)**

The event logs reveal **systematic bias** in the decision-making process, favoring **Group B (Unprotected Group)** over **Group A (Protected Group)**. This bias manifests in **score adjustments, approval rates, and resource allocation**, particularly through the **`LocalResident`** and **`CommunityGroup`** attributes. Below is a detailed breakdown:

---

## **1. Key Observations of Bias**

### **A. Score Adjustments Favor Group B (Unprotected Group)**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - **No score adjustments** (`ScoreAdjustment = 0` for all cases).
  - **Final decisions are based solely on the `PreliminaryScore`.**
    - P001 (720)  **Approved**
    - P002 (710)  **Rejected**
    - P003 (740)  **Approved**

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - **Score adjustments are applied** (`+10` for members of `Highland Civic Darts Club`).
  - **Final decisions incorporate these adjustments**, effectively **boosting scores** for certain applicants.
    - U001 (720  **730**)  **Approved** *(would have been borderline at 720)*
    - U002 (710  **710**)  **Rejected** *(no adjustment, same as P002)*
    - U003 (695  **705**)  **Approved** *(would have been rejected at 695)*

** Bias Manifestation:**
- **Group B members in `Highland Civic Darts Club` receive a +10 score boost**, while **Group A members receive no adjustments regardless of community ties**.
- **U003 (Group B) was approved at 705**, while **P002 (Group A) was rejected at 710**—a **clear disparity** where a lower-scoring Group B applicant is approved due to the adjustment.

### **B. Approval Rates Disproportionately Favor Group B**
| Group | Total Cases | Approved | Rejected | Approval Rate |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **A (Protected)** | 3 | 2 | 1 | **66.7%** |
| **B (Unprotected)** | 3 | 2 | 1 | **66.7%** |

**At first glance, approval rates appear equal. However, when accounting for score adjustments:**
- **Without adjustments, Group B’s approval rate would drop to 33%** (only U001 would be approved at 720, while U003 would be rejected at 695).
- **Group A’s approval rate remains 66.7%** (no adjustments applied).

** Bias Manifestation:**
- **Group B benefits from score adjustments that artificially inflate their approval chances**, while **Group A is held to a stricter, unadjusted standard**.
- **If adjustments were applied fairly, Group A might have had a higher approval rate** (e.g., P002 at 710 could have been approved with a +10 boost).

---

### **C. CommunityGroup Attribute Introduces Favoritism**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - **All cases have `CommunityGroup = None`** (no community affiliation recorded).
  - **No score adjustments are applied**, even if they were part of a community.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - **Two out of three cases (`U001`, `U003`) belong to `Highland Civic Darts Club`** and receive a **+10 score adjustment**.
  - **U002 (no community group) receives no adjustment**, showing that **only certain communities benefit**.

** Bias Manifestation:**
- **The system explicitly rewards membership in `Highland Civic Darts Club`**, a group that **Group A does not appear to have access to** (or is not recorded).
- **This suggests either:**
  - **Group A is systematically excluded from recognized community groups**, or
  - **The system is designed to favor specific (unprotected) communities** while ignoring others.

---

### **D. LocalResident Status Does Not Explain the Disparity**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - All cases have `LocalResident = FALSE`.
  - **No score adjustments are applied.**

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - All cases have `LocalResident = TRUE`.
  - **Only those in `Highland Civic Darts Club` receive adjustments.**

** Bias Manifestation:**
- **Being a `LocalResident` alone does not guarantee a score boost** (U002, a local resident, received no adjustment).
- **The real advantage comes from being in a specific `CommunityGroup`**, which **Group A lacks access to**.
- **This suggests that `LocalResident` is not the primary driver of bias—rather, it is the intersection of `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` that creates unfair advantages.**

---

## **2. How This Bias Leads to Systematic Differences in Decisions**
### **A. Artificial Score Inflation for Group B**
- **Group B members in `Highland Civic Darts Club` effectively get a "free +10 points"**, while **Group A members get no such advantage**.
- **This leads to:**
  - **Lower-scoring Group B applicants being approved** (e.g., U003 at 705 vs. P002 at 710).
  - **Group A applicants being held to a stricter standard** (no adjustments, even if they had community ties).

### **B. Unequal Access to "Community Boosts"**
- **The system assumes that `Highland Civic Darts Club` is a "desirable" community**, but **Group A is either not part of it or not recorded as such**.
- **This creates a structural barrier** where **Group A cannot benefit from the same scoring advantages** as Group B.

### **C. Reinforcement of Existing Inequalities**
- **If Group A is a historically disadvantaged group (e.g., immigrants, minorities, or non-locals), this bias perpetuates exclusion.**
- **Group B (likely the majority or dominant group) receives preferential treatment**, reinforcing systemic inequities.

## **3. Conclusion: Evidence of Algorithmic & Structural Bias**
The event logs demonstrate **multiple forms of bias**:

| **Type of Bias**          | **Evidence in Logs** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Score Adjustment Bias** | Group B gets +10 for `CommunityGroup`, Group A gets 0. |
| **Approval Rate Bias**    | Group B’s approval rate is artificially inflated by adjustments. |
| **Community Favoritism**  | Only `Highland Civic Darts Club` (Group B) gets boosts. |
| **Structural Exclusion**  | Group A has no recorded `CommunityGroup` affiliations. |
| **Disparate Impact**      | Lower-scoring Group B applicants are approved over higher-scoring Group A applicants. |

### **Final Verdict:**
 **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits clear bias in its favor.**
 **Group A (Protected Group) is systematically disadvantaged by:**
1. **Lack of score adjustments** (even when they might qualify).
2. **Exclusion from community-based boosts** (no recorded `CommunityGroup`).
3. **Stricter decision thresholds** (no leniency in scoring).

### **Recommendations to Mitigate Bias:**
1. **Apply score adjustments uniformly** (e.g., if `Highland Civic Darts Club` gets +10, other recognized communities should too).
2. **Audit `CommunityGroup` data** to ensure Group A is not systematically excluded.
3. **Remove or standardize score adjustments** to prevent artificial inflation of approvals.
4. **Test for disparate impact** by comparing approval rates **before and after adjustments**.
5. **Introduce fairness constraints** in the decision engine to ensure protected groups are not disproportionately rejected.

This analysis confirms that **the decision-making process is not neutral** and **actively favors Group B while disadvantaging Group A**.
