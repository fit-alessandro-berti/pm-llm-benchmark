The provided directly follows graph suggests that there are performance related issues for the process activities performed across different object types. While I cannot conclusively determine the specific root causes of performance issues from the data alone, I can identify a few potential areas for investigation based on the information given:

1. Pick items: The "pick item" activity appears to be a bottleneck in multiple object types. It has a high frequency of events and long durations associated with it. Investigate if there are any external factors, such as stock availability or workforce issues, affecting the time it takes to pick items for orders.
2. Confirm order: The "confirm order" activity also has a high frequency of events and leads to a long duration in the items, orders, and products object types. Investigate if any automation can improve the speed of order confirmation and reduce its impact on the overall process.
3. Payment and delivery times: There are long durations between payment-related activities and delivery-related activities across different object types (e.g., "send package" to "package delivered"). Investigate potential inefficiencies in the delivery process or payment processing that could lead to delayed deliveries.
4. High repeat activities: The directly follows graph shows a high number of repeat activities for certain object types, such as "pick item" to "pick item" for employees and "pick item" to "pick item" for products. Investigate if there are any root causes for these repeat activities, such as incorrect stock counts, order errors, or process inefficiencies.
5. Picker-wait time at the picking station: It is not directly mentioned in the data, but significantly long durations for pick items across object types might suggest that picker-wait time (idle time waiting for pallets or items to be delivered) is an issue.
6. Inventory and stock management: The "item out of stock" event leads to "reorder item" and "pick item" events in the items object type. Investigate if there are any inventory or stock management issues that could be causing longer lead times for picking items.

These potential root causes should guide further investigation into process-related issues and data insights, which may help improve the performance of the overall process.
