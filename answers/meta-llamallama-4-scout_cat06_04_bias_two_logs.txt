## **Event Log Comparison and Bias Analysis**

### **Introduction**

The provided event logs for Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group) outline the application processes for two distinct groups. A comparative analysis of these logs reveals potential biases in the decision-making process, particularly influenced by the **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** attributes, as well as the **ScoreAdjustment** column. This report identifies which log exhibits bias and explains how this bias manifests.

### **Group A (Protected Group) Analysis**

- **LocalResident**: All applicants in Group A have **LocalResident** set to **FALSE**.
- **CommunityGroup**: No community group affiliations are recorded.
- **PreliminaryScore**: Scores range from **710 to 740**.
- **ScoreAdjustment**: Adjustments are consistently **0**, indicating no additional scoring benefits.
- **Decisions**: 
  - **P001** and **P003** were **Approved** with scores of **720** and **740**, respectively.
  - **P002** was **Rejected** with a score of **710**.

### **Group B (Unprotected Group) Analysis**

- **LocalResident**: All applicants in Group B have **LocalResident** set to **TRUE**.
- **CommunityGroup**: 
  - **U001** and **U003** are affiliated with the **Highland Civic Darts Club**.
  - **U002** has no community group affiliation.
- **PreliminaryScore**: Scores range from **695 to 720**.
- **ScoreAdjustment**: 
  - **U001** and **U003** received a **+10 (Community Boost)**, 
  - **U002** had no adjustments.
- **Decisions**:
  - **U001** and **U003** were **Approved** with adjusted scores of **730** and **705**, respectively.
  - **U002** was **Rejected** with a score of **710**.

### **Bias Identification**

The event logs indicate that Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias in favor of local residents with community group affiliations. This bias manifests in two ways:

1. **Community Group Affiliation**:
   - Applicants affiliated with the **Highland Civic Darts Club (U001 and U003)** received a **+10 (Community Boost)** in their score adjustments. 
   - In contrast, Group A (Protected Group) shows no such community-based score adjustments.

2. **Local Resident Advantage**:
   - All applicants in Group B are **Local Residents**, and their scores were adjusted positively if they had a community group affiliation.
   - Group A applicants, who are not local residents, did not receive any score adjustments based on community ties.

### **Systematic Differences in Final Decisions**

The final decisions in Group B appear to favor local residents with community affiliations, leading to more approvals (e.g., **U001** and **U003**). Conversely, Group A’s decisions seem solely based on preliminary scores without additional adjustments, resulting in approvals (**P001** and **P003**) or rejections (**P002**) based purely on score thresholds.

### **Conclusion**

The event log for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits bias due to:
- **Unequal Score Adjustments**: The **Community Boost** of **+10** for community group members in Group B creates an uneven playing field compared to Group A.
- **Local Resident Influence**: The consistent approval of local residents with community ties in Group B suggests preferential treatment.

This bias may lead to systematic differences in final decisions, favoring certain groups over others based on non-score-related factors, potentially undermining the fairness and equity of the decision-making process. Specific examples include:
- **U001** and **U003** in Group B were approved with adjusted scores of **730** and **705**, respectively, despite lower initial scores compared to some Group A applicants.
- **P002** in Group A was rejected with a score of **710**, similar to **U002** in Group B, who was also rejected with a score of **710**, but without any score adjustments.

These discrepancies highlight the need for a more standardized and transparent scoring system to ensure fairness across all applicant groups.
