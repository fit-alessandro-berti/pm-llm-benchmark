The provided visualization presents a structured overview of a healthcare lab processing system broken down into different sections:

---

### (a) **Two Proctlet Classes Connected Through Two Channels**
This section shows an activity-style diagram modeling a process starting from a **Lab Visit** to performing and communicating **Lab Tests**. It includes two roles interacting through asynchronous messaging.

#### Main Elements:
- **Actors**:
  -  Doctor: Likely initiates the blood test through "Order entry".
  -  Lab Assistants: Handle the blood sample collection and interpreting results.
  -  Chemical Analysts: Perform lab tests and prepare reports.

- **Major Activities in “Lab Visit” proctlet**:
  1. **Order entry**  Test is ordered.
  2. **Take blood sample**  Conducted by lab assistant.
  3. **Judge results**  Determines if results are fine or re-testing is needed.
     - If fine  "Send report".
     - If not fine  "Do tests again" loop.

- **Major Activities in “Lab Test” proctlet**:
  1. **Perform test**  Actual chemical testing.
  2. **Make report**  Generates result report.
  3. If needed, **Perform test again** and **Provide updated report**.

- **Interaction Channels**:
  - **Order System**: Initiates the testing request (e.g., HGB test).
  - **HIS (Health Information System)**: Manages result exchanges.

- **Communication Flow**:
  - Lab visit triggers the test request to lab test (via Order System).
  - Lab test sends results back (via HIS).
  - Possibility of feedback loop if results are unsatisfactory.

### (b) **Class Diagram Containing the Two Proctlet Classes**
- Shows a UML class diagram highlighting the relationship:
  - **Lab visit** is associated with **Lab test**.
  - Each Lab Visit (1..1) is connected to one or more (1..*) Lab Test(s).
  - This validates the many-to-one relationship in process execution.

### (c) **Example of a Performative**
- This table illustrates a specific **message transmission** in the system.
  - **Time**: 11:00
  - **Channel**: Order system
  - **Sender**: Lab visit – John
  - **Receivers**: Lab test – HGB John (Request for HGB test on John)
  - **Action**: Create
  - **Content**: "Can you perform an HGB test for John?"
  - **Scope**: Private
  - **Direction**: OUT (outgoing message from Lab visit to Lab test)

### Summary
This visualization depicts a collaborative process between healthcare professionals performing and managing lab tests. It highlights coordination across two main modules (Lab Visit and Lab Test) using message channels and system components like HIS and Order System to ensure proper test execution and result communication.
