1. Cases with significantly longer duration (Submit Claim  Close Claim)

- **Case 2001 (A, Low):**  
  2024-04-01 09:00  10:30 (same day)  1.5 hours

- **Case 2004 (B, Low):**  
  2024-04-01 09:20  10:45 (same day)  1.5 hours  

- **Case 2002 (B, Medium):**  
  2024-04-01 09:05  2024-04-02 11:00  1 day 2 hours  

- **Case 2003 (A, High):**  
  2024-04-01 09:10  2024-04-03 09:30  2 days  

- **Case 2005 (B, High):**  
  2024-04-01 09:25  2024-04-04 14:30  3 days 5 hours  

**Significantly longer cases:** 2002, 2003, 2005  
(Low-complexity cases 2001 and 2004 finish quickly and form the “good performance” baseline.)

2. Attribute analysis and likely root causes

### a) Complexity

Pattern:
- **Low complexity (2001, 2004):**  
  - No “Request Additional Documents” steps.  
  - End-to-end  1.5 hours.
- **Medium complexity (2002):**  
  - 1 “Request Additional Documents.”  
  - Duration stretches to  1 day.
- **High complexity (2003, 2005):**  
  - Multiple “Request Additional Documents”:
    - 2003: 2 requests.
    - 2005: 3 requests.
  - Durations jump to  2–3+ days.

Root cause from complexity:
- Higher complexity  more document requests  longer waiting for customers to respond and staff to re-check.  
- This introduces repeated “stop-and-wait” cycles between insurer and customer.

Mitigation ideas:
- For **High** and **Medium** claims:
  - Introduce an upfront, standardized checklist of required documents to reduce repeated requests.
  - Use **pre-claim data** (e.g., policy data, previous claims) to auto-fill / auto-verify information.
  - Set **SLA and reminders** for customer response and adjuster follow-up after a document request.
  - Route high-complexity claims to **specialized senior adjusters** who can anticipate information needs upfront.

### b) Region (A vs B)

Overview by region and complexity:

- **Region A:**
  - 2001 (Low): 1.5 hours
  - 2003 (High):  2 days  
   Low is fast; high is long but shorter than high in Region B.

- **Region B:**
  - 2004 (Low): 1.5 hours (similar baseline to A)
  - 2002 (Medium):  1 day 2 hours
  - 2005 (High):  3 days 5 hours (worst case)  

Observations:
- Low complexity behaves similarly in both regions.
- For higher complexity, **Region B cases (2002, 2005) are slower than comparable Region A case 2003**:
  - Both 2003 (A, High) and 2005 (B, High) have multiple document requests, but 2005 is about a day longer.
- Region B’s medium complexity case (2002) already spans more than a day, whereas Region A has no medium cases in the sample, but it is clearly much slower than low cases.

Possible root causes specific to Region B:
- **Longer waiting times between events**, especially after document requests.
- Possible **higher workload or backlog** for Region B adjusters or finance staff (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa, Finance_Carl).
- Region B may have **more fragmented communication** with customers or agents, leading to delays in collecting additional documents.

Mitigation ideas for Region B:
- Monitor **queue lengths and workload** of Region B resources; rebalance if necessary (e.g., cross-region support).
- Introduce **region-specific SLAs** for high/medium complexity claims and track compliance.
- If customer response in Region B is slower (e.g., due to local practices), use:
  - clearer communication templates,
  - digital upload portals,
  - proactive follow-up calls.

### c) Resource-level patterns

**CSR (Frontline):**
- CSR_Jane: 2001 (A, Low), 2003 (A, High) – both start and end; no evidence she causes delay.
- CSR_Paul: 2002, 2005 (both B) – both long, but CSR mainly handles submit/close; delays occur in between, so CSR is not the main bottleneck.
- CSR_Mary: 2004 (B, Low) – fast.

CSR conclusion: not a bottleneck; they bookend the process.

**Adjusters:**
- Adjuster_Mike (Region A):
  - 2001 (Low): No doc request; very fast.
  - 2003 (High): 2 doc requests; total  2 days.
- Adjuster_Lisa (Region B):
  - 2002 (Medium): 1 doc request; ~1 day+.
  - 2004 (Low): No doc request; fast.
  - 2005 (High): 3 doc requests; ~3+ days (worst).

Key pattern:
- **All cases with “Request Additional Documents” are handled by adjusters (Mike or Lisa).**
- More document requests correlate with longer duration, and **Lisa’s high-complexity case (2005) has the most requests and the longest time.**

Possible resource-related explanations:
- For **high-complexity in Region B**, Adjuster_Lisa:
  - Might be requesting information incrementally (discovering new gaps with each review) instead of consolidating all missing info at once.
  - Could be dealing with **heavier workload**, causing longer idle times between customer response and next action.
  - Might have **less guidance or tooling** for high-complexity claims than Region A.

Mitigation for adjusters:
- Introduce a **structured assessment template** for complex claims to identify all required documents in a single, comprehensive request where possible.
- Provide **training and decision support** for complex-claim assessment (especially for Region B).
- Set **limits or alerts** for repeated document requests per case (e.g., flag cases with 2+ requests for a senior review).
- Ensure adjusters can see **end-to-end case history and documents in one place** to avoid re-asking for similar information.

**Managers (Approval step):**
- Manager_Ann: Cases 2001, 2002, 2004 – fast approval once previous steps complete (minutes to under an hour).
- Manager_Bill: Cases 2003, 2005 (both high). Approvals are:
  - 2003: Approve on 2024-04-02 16:00 after last doc request on 2024-04-01 17:00  ~23 hours gap.
  - 2005: Approve on 2024-04-04 10:00 after last doc request on 2024-04-03 15:00  ~19 hours gap.

The long overall duration in 2003 and 2005 is dominated by the document request phase; the manager’s approval adds less but still roughly a working-day delay.

Mitigation for managers:
- Prioritize **high-complexity cases** in approval queues once documents are complete.
- Implement **notifications** when all requested documents have arrived and the case is ready to approve.
- Define **target turnaround time** for approvals of high/medium complexity claims and monitor adherence.

**Finance:**
- Finance_Alan (A) and Finance_Carl (B) process payments quickly once approval is done (same day within an hour or so). They do not appear to be a major source of delay.

3. Summary of root causes and targeted improvements

**Main root causes of long durations:**
1. **High and medium complexity**  more and repeated “Request Additional Documents” steps  extended waiting cycles.
2. **Region B high/medium cases (2002, 2005)** show more pronounced delays than Region A, especially in high complexity.
3. **Adjuster behavior in complex cases**, particularly:
   - Multiple sequential document requests (e.g., 3 in 2005).
   - Likely backlog or lack of structured review leading to piecemeal requests.
4. **Manager approval in complex cases** adds ~1 working day, but is a secondary contributor relative to document-request delays.

**Actionable mitigation suggestions:**

- **Process design / data collection**
  - Create **complexity-specific checklists** and templates so that adjusters gather all needed documents in one or two rounds instead of multiple.
  - Use **pre-populated data** from internal systems to reduce what needs to be asked from the customer.

- **Operational controls**
  - Set **SLA thresholds and alerts** for:
    - time between “Request Additional Documents” and subsequent events,
    - number of document requests per case.
  - For flagged cases, trigger a **senior adjuster review**.

- **Region B focus**
  - Analyze Region B’s **workload, staffing, and training** for complex claims.
  - Consider **cross-region routing** of high-complexity claims to balance load.
  - Introduce **region-specific coaching/guidelines** for Adjuster_Lisa-like profiles.

- **Technology support**
  - Implement a **case dashboard** showing:
    - complexity,
    - number of doc requests,
    - current wait time since last action.
  - Provide adjusters with **decision support** (rules, checklists) embedded in the system to reduce rework.

With these measures, the process should reduce the disproportionate delays seen in cases 2002, 2003, and especially 2005, while keeping the efficiency demonstrated by low-complexity cases 2001 and 2004.
