**Solution:**
```
ProcessTree (Root)
    -> (Activity: Receive Application (RA))
    -> (Activity: Validate Form (VF))
    * (Operator: LOOP, Children:
        -> (Activity: Assess Eligibility (AE))
        + (Operator: XOR, Children:
            - Activity: Request Missing Info (RMI)
            - Activity: Approval Decision (AD)
        )
    )
    -> (Activity: Send Confirmation (SC))
    -> (Activity: Archive Case (AC))
```

This process tree model captures the main flow and the optional looping behavior as observed in the event log. The main sequence includes 'Receive Application', 'Validate Form', 'Send Confirmation', and 'Archive Case'. Within this main flow, there is a loop that may contain either 'Assess Eligibility' or 'Approval Decision' followed by an optional 'Request Missing Info'. This loop can repeat as many times as necessary until the process moves on to 'Send Confirmation'.
