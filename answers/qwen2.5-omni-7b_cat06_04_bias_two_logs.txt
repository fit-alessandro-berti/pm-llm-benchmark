### Comparison of Event Logs Between Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group)

#### Overview:
Both groups follow similar processes but exhibit different outcomes due to certain attributes influencing their decision-making process.

#### Key Attributes:
1. **LocalResident**: Indicates whether the applicant is a local resident.
2. **CommunityGroup**: Indicates if the applicant belongs to a community group.
3. **ScoreAdjustment**: Reflects any adjustments made to the preliminary score based on specific criteria like community boost or other factors.

#### Analysis:

##### Group A (Protected Group):
- **Cases with LocalResident = FALSE**:
  - **P001**: No adjustment was made during scoring, and it was approved after manual review.
  - **P002**: Similarly, no adjustment was made, and it was rejected after manual review.
  
- **Cases with LocalResident = TRUE**:
  - **P003**: The case was approved without any adjustments.

##### Group B (Unprotected Group):
- **Cases with LocalResident = TRUE**:
  - **U001**: The case was approved after an initial score of 720 was adjusted by +10 points.
  - **U002**: The case was rejected despite having an initial score of 710.
  - **U003**: The case was approved after being initially scored at 695 and then adjusted by +10 points.

#### Bias Identification:
The **bias** appears to be related to the interaction between the `LocalResident` attribute and the `CommunityGroup` attribute within Group B. Specifically, cases where applicants belong to a community group (`CommunityGroup = TRUE`) seem to receive additional adjustments (+10 points), leading to higher scores and more favorable decisions compared to those who do not belong to such groups.

#### Manifestation of Bias:
1. **CommunityBoost Adjustment**: Cases belonging to community groups receive a fixed adjustment of +10 points to their preliminary scores. This adjustment is applied regardless of the initial score value.
   
2. **Systematic Differences**: 
   - In Group B, cases with `LocalResident = TRUE` and `CommunityGroup = TRUE` consistently receive higher scores and favorable decisions.
   - Conversely, cases with only `LocalResident = TRUE` and no community group affiliation do not benefit from the same adjustment, resulting in lower scores and unfavorable decisions.

#### Potential Systematic Differences:
- **Resource Allocation**: Resources allocated to community groups may be perceived as more valuable or beneficial, leading to higher adjustments.
- **Perceived Value**: Community groups may be viewed as adding greater value or importance, justifying the additional point adjustment.
- **Policy Implementation**: There could be a policy or practice favoring community group members over non-members, even when all other factors remain constant.

#### Conclusion:
The bias in Group B's event log is evident through the systematic difference in decision outcomes based on the presence of both `LocalResident = TRUE` and `CommunityGroup = TRUE`. This bias can be attributed to the application of a fixed adjustment (+10 points) to cases involving community groups, which disproportionately benefits them compared to local residents without community group affiliations. To mitigate this bias, it would be necessary to ensure that all applicants are evaluated equally, irrespective of their community group membership.
