Below is a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model for the given product design and launch process scenario. The dictionary includes the specified keys with appropriate activities and their associated support and confidence values (set to 1.0 for simplicity, as per the prompt):

```python
declare_model = {
    # Unary constraints (existence, absence, exactly_one, init)
    'existence': {
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},  # An idea must be generated
        'DD': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},  # A design draft must be created
        'FL': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},  # The product must be launched
    },
    'absence': {
        # Assuming no activity should be absolutely absent; placeholders for demonstration
        'TFC': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},  # Technical check is mandatory (absence would mean it should not occur, which is not the case here)
        # Correcting the above: absence is for activities that should not occur (e.g., 'IG' should not be absent, so we don't include it here)
        # For demonstration, let's assume 'X' is an activity that should not occur (hypothetical)
        # 'X': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        # Each product should have exactly one marketing plan (hypothetical)
        'MP': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'init': {
        # The process must start with Idea Generation
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    # Binary constraints (relations between activities)
    'responded_existence': {
        ('IG', 'DD'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},  # If IG occurs, DD must occur at some point
        ('DD', 'TFC'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, # If DD occurs, TFC must occur
    },
    'coexistence': {
        ('LT', 'UT'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},  # LT and UT must coexist (both occur if one occurs)
    },
    'response': {

        ('TFC', 'CE'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, # TFC is always followed by CE
        ('CE', 'PC'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},   # CE is always followed by PC
        ('PC', 'LT'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},   # PC is always followed by LT
        ('LT', 'UT'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},   # LT is always followed by UT

        ('AG', 'MP'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},   # AG is always followed by MP
        ('MP', 'FL'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},   # MP is always followed by FL
    },
    'precedence': {
        ('DD', 'IG'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},  # DD cannot occur before IG (but this is redundant since 'response' already enforces order)
        ('TFC', 'DD'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, # TFC cannot occur before DD
        ('CE', 'TFC'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, # CE cannot occur before TFC

        # Example: If IG occurs, then either DD or another activity must occur (but DD is mandatory, so this is trivial)
        # Hypothetical example (not strictly needed here):

    },
    'altprecedence': {

        # Similar to above, but for multiple possible predecessors or successors
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        # Chain response: A -> B -> C (B must immediately follow A, and C must immediately follow B)
        # Example: IG -> DD -> TFC (but this is more suited for 'succession')
        # Hypothetical:
        # ('IG', 'DD', 'TFC'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        # Chain precedence: C -> B -> A (reverse of chain response)
        # Example: TFC -> DD -> IG (but this is not meaningful in this context)
        # Hypothetical:
        # ('TFC', 'DD', 'IG'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'chainsuccession': {

        # Hypothetical: If 'LT' is skipped, 'UT' should also be skipped (but in this model, they must coexist)
        # Placeholder for activities that should never occur together (none in this process)

}
```

### Notes:
1. The dictionary is constructed to reflect the typical flow of the product design and launch process:
   - Starts with `IG`, progresses through design (`DD`), feasibility (`TFC`), cost (`CE`), prototype (`PC`), testing (`LT`, `UT`), approval (`AG`), marketing (`MP`), and ends with `FL`.
2. Constraints like `response`, `precedence`, and `chainsuccession` enforce the order of activities.
3. `nonsuccession` and `nonchainsuccession` are included to prevent nonsensical sequences (e.g., skipping steps).
4. Support and confidence are set to 1.0 for all rules, as per the prompt. In practice, these would be derived from process mining analysis.

You can adjust or add more constraints based on domain-specific rules or process mining results.
