 The data represents a workflow or process for handling employee declarations, which likely include expense reports, time-off requests, or other forms of approvals that require multiple stages and different actors (such as employees, administrators, budget owners, and supervisors) to review and approve. Here's a step-by-step description of the process based on the provided data:

1. **Submission by Employee**: Every process begins with an employee submitting their declaration for review. This is the starting point in all the scenarios listed.

2. **Approval by Administration**: After submission, the declaration is reviewed and potentially approved by an administrative staff member or a system that acts as the first level of approval.

3. **Approval by Budget Owner**: Some declarations then move on to be reviewed by the budget owner, who ensures that the declaration does not exceed the available budget or aligns with financial constraints.

4. **Final Approval by Supervisor**: Once both administration and the budget owner have approved the declaration, it goes to the supervisor for final approval. This is the point where the declaration is fully authorized.

5. **Payment Handled**: After all approvals are obtained, the payment process is initiated and handled, marking the completion of the transaction.

6. **Rejection Steps**: In cases where an approval step is not reached (either because the declaration is rejected or because it loops back to the employee for additional information), the declaration may go through one or more rejection phases:
   - The supervisor can reject the finalized declaration, and it may be sent back to the employee.
   - The employee may then resubmit the declaration, which enters the cycle again from the initial approval step (administration).
   - Alternatively, an intermediary role such as a pre-approver or another administrative level can reject the declaration before it reaches the supervisor, sending it back to the employee for corrections or additional information.

7. **Missing Step**: There is one instance where the declaration reaches the final approval stage but then encounters a "MISSING" step, which could indicate a required action (such as additional documentation) that is missing and prevents the process from proceeding to payment handling.

8. **Performance Metrics**: Each step of the process has an associated performance metric, likely indicating the efficiency or success rate of each approval stage. For example, a high performance metric indicates that most declarations at that stage are processed successfully without issues or rejections.

9. **Frequency**: The frequency count (e.g., 4 times) refers to how often a particular outcome occurred, such as the number of times a declaration successfully passed through all stages and resulted in a payment being handled.

The data suggests that there is variability in the process, with some declarations being approved smoothly while others encounter rejections at various stages. The "MISSING" step indicates potential bottlenecks or missing components in the approval workflow. Overall, the data highlights the importance of each role (employee, administration, budget owner, supervisor) in ensuring that declarations are processed correctly and efficiently.
