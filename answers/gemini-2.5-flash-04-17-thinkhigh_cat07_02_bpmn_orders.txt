The provided visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram depicting a sales order processing workflow involving multiple departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

The diagram is organized into four swimlanes, each representing a different department:

**1. Sales:**
- The process starts on "Monday morning" with checking the customer's order for completeness.
- It then checks if the customer is already in the database.
- There's a decision gateway:
    - If the customer is not in the database, they are added. This involves interaction with a database.
    - If the customer is in the database, the process proceeds.
- Regardless of whether the customer was added or not, the process converges at another gateway.
- The next step is to "Send order details".
- After the product is sent (indicated by a message event triggered by the Warehouse department), the final step in Sales is to "Draft invoice".
- The process in the Sales swimlane ends with a termination event.
- There is a dashed line representing the message flow "Order details" sent from Sales to Production and Procurement.

**2. Production:**
- This swimlane starts with a receiving message event indicating "Order details arrive".
- A parallel gateway splits the flow to "Plan production" and another path that eventually leads to "Manufacture product".
- "Plan production" leads to a parallel gateway which then joins with the flow from the split gateway before "Manufacture product".
- After "Manufacture product", there is a signal event labeled "Product complete".
- There's a connection from the Production swimlane to the Procurement swimlane with a path labeled "Material not faulty", suggesting a conditional flow.

**3. Procurement:**
- This swimlane also starts with a receiving message event indicating "Order details arrive".
- There is a sub-process labeled "Material Compensation Subprocess".
- Inside the sub-process:
    - The process starts by "Order materials".
    - There is a task "Return material" which seems to be triggered by a signal or event (indicated by the dotted arrow and symbol).
    - "Order materials" and "Return material" both lead to an inclusive gateway.
    - From the inclusive gateway, the flow goes to "Check materials".
    - "Check materials" has a parallel multiple instance marker.
    - After checking materials, there is an exclusive gateway with a path labeled "Order cancellation".
- There is a signal event triggered from the Procurement swimlane labeled "Order cancellation".
- There is a connection from the "Check materials" task in Procurement to the Production swimlane, suggesting a link related to material status.

**4. Warehouse:**
- This swimlane starts with a receiving message event indicating "Product complete" (triggered by the Production department).
- The next step is to "Send product".
- The process in the Warehouse swimlane ends with a sending message event indicating "Product sent" (which triggers the "Draft invoice" task in the Sales swimlane).

Overall, the diagram illustrates a standard order fulfillment process, detailing the interactions and dependencies between different departments, including handling customer information, planning and executing production, managing material procurement (including a potential compensation sub-process), and finally, shipping the product and generating an invoice. The use of different BPMN symbols (tasks, events, gateways, pools, swimlanes, message flows) effectively communicates the flow of activities and information within this business process.
