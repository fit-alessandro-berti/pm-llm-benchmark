**Analysis and Renaming Strategy**

The primary issue in the original log is the repetition of generic activity names that obscure the specific nature of the events. To resolve this, I have analyzed the "Additional Context" and the sequence of operations to derive specific names.

**Key Changes:**

1.  **`Initiate Request`**: Context differs based on entry channel.
    *   **New Name 1:** `Submit Online Request` (Used for web portal entries).
    *   **New Name 2:** `Walk-in Registration` (Used for branch visits).

2.  **`Verify Documents`**: The nature of the verification changes. It often starts with an automated or high-level check (which reveals missing data) and ends with a final validation after issues are resolved.
    *   **New Name 1:** `Check Document Completeness` (Used for the first pass, often triggering a rejection or request for more info).
    *   **New Name 2:** `Final Document Validation` (Used for the second pass, confirming the case is ready for approval).

3.  **`Call Customer`**: The intent of the call differs. Sometimes it is to request missing data (blocking the process), and other times it is to clarify information or confirm actions taken (closing the loop).
    *   **New Name 1:** `Request Missing Information` (Urgent call to unblock the workflow).
    *   **New Name 2:** `Clarification & Confirmation Call` (Information gathering or verification of internal changes).

4.  **`Adjust Account`**: While the activity is the same, the context in the log indicates it is a specific "Correction" step triggered by missing data or discrepancies found during verification.
    *   **New Name:** `Correction of Data Discrepancy` (To emphasize it is a remediation step).

### Justification of Naming Choices

1.  **`Initiate Request`  `Submit Online Request` vs. `Walk-in Registration`**
    *   *Justification:* The distinction is based on the **Resource** column (WebPortal vs. BranchReception) and the **Context**. Renaming these helps distinguish between digital-first and physical-first customer journeys.

2.  **`Verify Documents`  `Check Document Completeness` vs. `Final Document Validation`**
    *   *Justification:* In C001 and C003, the first occurrence of this activity is immediately followed by a "Call Customer" or "Adjust Account," implying the check was *incomplete* or failed. The second occurrence happens after the customer provides the missing data (`Submit Additional`) or the agent makes a correction, implying this is the *final* check before approval.

3.  **`Call Customer`  `Request Missing Information` vs. `Clarification & Confirmation Call`**
    *   *Justification:* The context in C001 and C003 explicitly mentions missing docs or the customer stepping out (requiring them to return). This is a "blocking" call. In C002, the context mentions clarifying a discrepancy and confirming adjustments. This is a "service/closing" call. Separating these names highlights different operational burdens (data collection vs. customer service).

4.  **`Adjust Account`  `Correction of Data Discrepancy`**
    *   *Justification:* While the activity name is slightly longer, "Adjust Account" is vague. The context indicates these adjustments are made due to specific errors or missing info found during verification. Renaming it to "Correction" clarifies that this is a remediation step in the workflow.
