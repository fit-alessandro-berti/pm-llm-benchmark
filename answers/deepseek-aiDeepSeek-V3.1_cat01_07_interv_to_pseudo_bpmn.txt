Of course. Based on the provided interview transcripts, here is a structured, textual BPMN-like model of the invoice approval process.

### **Process Model: Invoice Approval and Payment**

**Process Name:** Standard Invoice Processing with Exception Handling
**Primary Participants:**
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** (e.g., Mary): Initiates the process, performs initial checks, manages the flow.
*   **Purchasing Officer** (e.g., Dan): Confirms receipt and matches order details.
*   **Department Manager** (e.g., Carlos): Provides final financial approval.
*   **AP Supervisor** (e.g., Rita): Handles escalated exceptions and informal invoices.
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager** (e.g., Karen): Supports issue resolution with suppliers (supporting role).

**Key Artifacts:**
*   **Input:** Invoice (received via email)
*   **Data Object:** Purchase Order (PO)
*   **Output:** Approved Invoice scheduled for payment.

### **Textual Process Description**

**Start Event:** Invoice is received (via email).

1.  **Task: Check for PO Number**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** Clerk reviews the received invoice for a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive):** PO Number Present?
        *   **No Path (Missing PO):** Proceed to **"Request PO from Supplier"**.
        *   **Yes Path (PO Present):** Proceed to **"Log Invoice in System"**.

2.  **Task: Request PO from Supplier** [Exception Path 1]
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The invoice is sent back to the supplier to request the missing PO number. **Note:** *In some cases, the Purchasing Officer or Supplier Relationship Manager may also be asked to contact the supplier for this information.*
    *   **Sequence Flow:** The process waits here until a response is received. Once a corrected invoice or the PO number is provided, the flow returns to **"Check for PO Number"**.

3.  **Task: Log Invoice in System**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The invoice is formally entered into the accounting system.
    *   **Sequence Flow:** Proceed to **"Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation"**.

4.  **Task: Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The invoice is sent (via email/system) to the Purchasing department.
    *   **Sequence Flow:** Proceed to **"Confirm Receipt & Match to PO"**.

5.  **Task: Confirm Receipt & Match to PO**
    *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer
    *   **Description:** The officer checks that the goods/services were received and compares invoice details (quantities, prices, charges) against the original PO.
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive):** Details Match?
        *   **No Path (Discrepancy Found):** Proceed to **"Resolve Discrepancy with Supplier"**.
        *   **Yes Path (All Match):** Proceed to **"Send Confirmation to AP"**.

6.  **Task: Resolve Discrepancy with Supplier** [Exception Path 2]
    *   **Actor(s):** Purchasing Officer (primary), often supported by AP Clerk or Supplier Relationship Manager.
    *   **Description:** The discrepancy (e.g., wrong price, extra units) is investigated. This involves contacting the supplier directly or internally coordinating to request a corrected invoice.
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive):** Resolved Successfully?
        *   **No Path (Cannot Resolve):** Proceed to **"Escalate to AP Supervisor"**.
        *   **Yes Path (Resolved):** Flow returns to **"Confirm Receipt & Match to PO"** for re-verification.

7.  **Task: Send Confirmation to AP**
    *   **Actor:** Purchasing Officer
    *   **Description:** A confirmation email/notification is sent to the AP Clerk, affirming the invoice is valid.
    *   **Sequence Flow:** Proceed to **"Match Invoice to PO in System"**.

8.  **Task: Match Invoice to PO in System**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The clerk performs the final system-level matching based on the purchasing confirmation.
    *   **Sequence Flow:** Proceed to **"Send for Manager Approval"**. **Note:** *This triggers an automatic notification to the manager.*

9.  **Task: Send for Manager Approval**
    *   **Actor:** System / AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The invoice, along with the PO and purchasing confirmation, is routed to the Department Manager for final approval.
    *   **Sequence Flow:** Proceed to **"Review and Approve Invoice"**.

10. **Task: Review and Approve Invoice**
    *   **Actor:** Department Manager
    *   **Description:** The manager reviews the package for final sign-off, checking for budgetary alignment and any anomalies.
    *   **Gateway (Exclusive):** Approval Granted?
        *   **No Path (Rejected/Queried):** Proceed to **"Investigate Suspicious Item"** [Exception Path 3]. The manager may ask the AP Clerk to hold and investigate.
        *   **Yes Path (Approved):** Proceed to **"Schedule Payment"**.

11. **Task: Schedule Payment**
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk
    *   **Description:** The approved invoice is queued for the next accounts payable payment run.
    *   **End Event:** Invoice payment is scheduled.

### **Exception Handling Paths**

*   **A. Escalate to AP Supervisor** [From: "Resolve Discrepancy with Supplier" (No Path)]
    *   **Actor:** AP Clerk escalates to AP Supervisor.
    *   **Description:** The Supervisor (Rita) takes over coordination for complex discrepancies. They contact suppliers and departments directly. For **informal invoices without a PO**, the Supervisor works with department heads to create a retrospective PO or make a reject/approve decision.
    *   **Sequence Flow:** Once the exception is resolved, the process returns to the main flow at the point most applicable (typically back to **"Confirm Receipt & Match to PO"** or **"Send for Manager Approval"**).

*   **B. Investigate Suspicious Item** [From: "Review and Approve Invoice" (No Path)]
    *   **Actor:** Department Manager instructs AP Clerk to investigate.
    *   **Description:** The AP Clerk (and potentially others) investigates budgetary issues or unexpected items flagged by the manager.
    *   **Sequence Flow:** After investigation, the process returns to **"Send for Manager Approval"** for a re-review.

### **Notes on Ambiguity and Consolidation**

*   **Supplier Relationship Manager Role:** Karen's role is clearly a supporting role, not a primary participant in the standard flow. Her tasks are embedded within the "Resolve Discrepancy with Supplier" and "Escalate to AP Supervisor" activities.
*   **System Triggers:** The interviews mention an automated system email for manager approval. This is modeled as a system task triggering the flow to the manager.
*   **"Log Invoice" Timing:** There is minor ambiguity on whether the invoice is logged before or after the initial PO check. The model follows Mary's (AP Clerk) account as the primary source, logging it only after the PO check is passed.
*   **Final Approval Step:** All accounts consistently place the Department Manager's approval as the final step before payment scheduling.
