**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process  
**Purpose:** To approve and schedule payment for supplier invoices based on purchase orders and internal verification.

---

### **1. Start Event:**
- **Trigger:** Invoice received by email or system (from supplier).

---

### **2. Activities/Tasks:**

**Activity 1:**  
**Name:** *Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO)*  
**Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
**Description:**  
- Verify if the invoice includes a valid PO number.  
- **If no PO is present:**  
  - **Send invoice back to supplier** for clarification or additional details.  
  - **Note:** This may trigger a loop back to the start event (supplier resubmits invoice).  
- **If PO is present:**  
  - Log the invoice into the accounting system.

**Activity 2:**  
**Name:** *Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services*  
**Performer:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
**Description:**  
- Compare invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) with the associated PO.  
- **If discrepancies found:**  
  - Contact supplier or request clarification.  
  - Instruct Mary to **hold the invoice** until resolved.  
- **If no discrepancies:**  
  - Send confirmation email to Accounts Payable (Mary).

**Activity 3:**  
**Name:** *Match Invoice to PO in System*  
**Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
**Description:**  
- Match invoice line items with PO in the accounting system.  
- **If discrepancies found (e.g., pricing, missing items):**  
  - Email Purchasing team to clarify.  
  - **If unresolved:** Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
- **If no discrepancies:**  
  - Proceed to **Manager Approval**.

**Activity 4:**  
**Name:** *Manager Approval*  
**Performer:** Department Manager (Carlos)  
**Description:**  
- Review invoice, PO, and confirmation in the system.  
- **If all details match and within budget:**  
  - Approve the invoice.  
- **If discrepancies or budget concerns:**  
  - Reject or request investigation.  
  - In rare cases, may require **escalation to higher management**.

**Activity 5:**  
**Name:** *Schedule Payment*  
**Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
**Description:**  
- Add approved invoice to the next payment run.  
- Generate payment documentation.

**Activity 6 (Exception):**  
**Name:** *Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)*  
**Performer:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
**Description:**  
- Triggered when invoice cannot be matched or discrepancies cannot be resolved.  
- Supervisor (Rita) contacts supplier or coordinates between departments.  
- May involve creating a **retrospective PO** or rejecting the invoice.  
- Once resolved, process resumes with **Activity 2 (Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services)**.

**Activity 7 (Exception):**  
**Name:** *Supplier Communication*  
**Performer:** Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
**Description:**  
- Triggered when PO is missing or pricing is incorrect.  
- Karen communicates with supplier to resolve discrepancies.  
- Informs AP or Purchasing with corrected information.

### **3. Sequence Flow:**

1. **Start Event (Invoice Received)**
2.  **Check for Valid PO (Mary)**
   - **If no PO ** Send to supplier (loop back to Start)
   - **If PO exists ** Log invoice in system
3.  **Confirm Receipt of Goods (Dan)**
   - **If discrepancies ** Hold invoice; communicate with supplier
   - **If no discrepancies ** Send confirmation to Mary
4.  **Match Invoice to PO (Mary)**
   - **If discrepancies ** Escalate to Rita or communicate with supplier
   - **If no discrepancies ** Proceed to Manager Approval
5.  **Manager Approval (Carlos)**
   - **If approved ** Schedule Payment
   - **If not approved ** Reject or investigate
6.  **Schedule Payment (Mary)**
7. **End Event**

---

### **4. Gateways/Decision Points:**

- **Exclusive Gateway 1:** *Is the invoice associated with a valid PO?*  
  - **Yes ** Log invoice  
  - **No ** Send to supplier

- **Exclusive Gateway 2:** *Are invoice details matching the PO?*  
  - **Yes ** Proceed to Manager Approval  
  - **No ** Escalate or communicate with supplier

- **Exclusive Gateway 3:** *Is the manager’s approval received?*  
  - **Yes ** Schedule payment  
  - **No ** Hold or escalate

---

### **5. Roles/Participants:**

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**  
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**  
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**  
- **Supplier**

---

### **6. Artifacts/Data Objects:**

- **Invoice** (input from supplier)  
- **Purchase Order (PO)**  
- **Invoice Confirmation** (from Purchasing)  
- **Manager Approval Status** (in system)  
- **Payment Schedule** (output)

---

### **7. Exceptions/Variations:**

- **Case 1:** Invoice missing PO  Send back to supplier (loop)  
- **Case 2:** Discrepancy between invoice and PO  Escalate to Rita or Karen  
- **Case 3:** Manager rejects invoice  Hold or investigate further  
- **Case 4:** Invoices without PO for informal services  Rita creates retrospective PO or rejects  
- **Case 5:** Rare escalation to higher management by Carlos (not modeled explicitly but noted)

---

### **Notes on Ambiguity:**

- There is some ambiguity regarding the **exact sequence** of matching the invoice with the PO. Some accounts describe this as occurring after the purchasing confirmation, while others suggest it is part of the initial review.  
- The **system trigger for manager approval** is described as automatic via email, but the exact system used or interface is not specified.  
- The **role of the supplier** is indirect and reactive, typically only involved when discrepancies arise.

### **Summary:**

This textual BPMN model captures the core workflow of the **Invoice Approval Process**, including the key activities, decision points, roles, and exception paths. It is structured to be easily converted into a formal BPMN diagram by a process modeler or analyst. Ambiguities and variations from stakeholder accounts are noted to ensure transparency and fidelity to the empirical data.
