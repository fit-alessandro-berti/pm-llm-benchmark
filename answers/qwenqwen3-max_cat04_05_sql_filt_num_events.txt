Here's the DuckDB SQL query that satisfies your requirements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inner Query (Subquery)**:
   - Groups events by `case_id`.
   - Counts the number of events per case using `COUNT(*)`.
   - Filters groups using `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to retain only cases with six or fewer events.

2. **Outer Query**:
   - Selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table.
   - Uses `WHERE case_id IN (...)` to include only those events whose `case_id` appears in the filtered result set from the subquery.

This approach ensures that:
- You first identify valid cases (6 events).
- Then retrieve all original event rows for those cases, preserving all columns including `activity`, `timestamp`, etc.

 Efficient, readable, and directly answers the prompt.
