Based on the provided attribute information, the following attributes are sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the applicant. Fairness analysis should ensure that the hiring process does not discriminate based on gender.

2. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen or not. Fairness analysis should ensure that the hiring process does not discriminate based on citizenship status.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant speaks German or not. Fairness analysis should ensure that the hiring process does not discriminate based on language proficiency.

4. **case:religious**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is religious or not. Fairness analysis should ensure that the hiring process does not discriminate based on religious beliefs.

These attributes are sensitive because they relate to protected characteristics, such as gender, citizenship, language, and religion. Fairness analysis should focus on ensuring that the hiring process is unbiased and does not discriminate against applicants based on these characteristics.

Additionally, you may also consider the **resource** attribute, as it may indicate biases in the hiring process related to the personnel involved (e.g., HR-dummy, Senior Partner, etc.). However, this attribute is more related to the process itself rather than the applicant's characteristics.
