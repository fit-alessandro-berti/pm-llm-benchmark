Based on the provided attributes, the following can be considered sensitive attributes for fairness:

1. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual, which is a protected characteristic in many fairness regulations.
2. **case:citizen**: Although not explicitly stated, this attribute might indicate nationality or immigration status, which can be considered a sensitive attribute in fairness contexts.
3. **case:religious**: This attribute indicates the individual's religious affiliation, which is also a protected characteristic in many fairness regulations.

These attributes are sensitive because they can be used to discriminate against individuals or groups based on their gender, nationality, or religious beliefs. Ensuring fairness in the decision-making process of the job application process means avoiding any bias or discrimination based on these attributes.

By analyzing these sensitive attributes, you can assess whether the process is fair and unbiased, or if there are disparities in treatment or outcomes for different groups.
