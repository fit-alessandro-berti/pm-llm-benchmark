## Event Log for Process Mining

The following event log integrates data from the various ERP tables, using `order_id` as the Case ID and maintaining chronological order.

**Assumptions Made:**
1. **Item Picking:** Since picking happens per line item, we create a separate "Item Picked" event for each unique `item_picking_date` within an order. If multiple items are picked at the exact same timestamp, they are grouped into one event.
2. **Resource Naming:** The provided `Resources Table` is used to enrich the `Resource/Actor` column. If a resource ID is not present (e.g., `customer_id`), the ID itself is used.
3. **Delivery Events:** One "Order Dispatched" event and one "Order Arrived" event are generated for every unique delivery record (`delivery_id`).
4. **Invoice/Payment Linking:** Invoice and payment events are linked back to the originating `order_id`.
