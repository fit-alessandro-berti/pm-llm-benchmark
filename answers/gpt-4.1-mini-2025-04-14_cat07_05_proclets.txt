The provided visualization consists of three parts labeled (a), (b), and (c), depicting a process and its related structure in a healthcare/lab testing context:

(a) Two procle(t) classes connected through two channels:
- This is a detailed flowchart illustrating interactions between two main entities: "Lab visit" and "Lab test."
- The flow starts with a doctor or lab assistant ordering a test and taking a blood sample during a lab visit.
- The order is sent through an "Order system" channel to the lab test side.
- The lab test process includes performing the test and making a report by a chemical analyst.
- Results are sent back through an HIS channel to the lab visit side, where a lab assistant judges the results.
- Depending on the outcome, tests may be performed again, and updated results are received.
- Eventually, a report is sent, concluding the process.
- Different roles are indicated on the sides (doctor, lab assistant, chemical analyst) responsible for various tasks.
- The connections between steps are shown, including dashed lines representing communication across channels.

(b) Class diagram containing the two procle(t) classes:
- Shows a simple UML-like class diagram indicating a relationship between two classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test."
- The multiplicity indicates that one "Lab visit" requires one or more "Lab tests."

(c) Example of a performative:
- A table that lists the details of a communication instance within the system.
- Columns include Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, and Direction.
- Example given shows a message at 11:00 sent through the "Order system" channel from "Lab visit - John" to "Lab test - HGB John" with the action "Create" and content "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
- The message has a private scope and is outgoing (OUT).

Overall, the visualization represents a healthcare lab test process workflow between two main components, their communication channels, and classes, supplemented with an example communication message to illustrate interaction in the system.
