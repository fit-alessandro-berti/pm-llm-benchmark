## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Attributes
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given sequence of hospital process events and identify patterns or attributes that can help group these events into distinct cases (patient journeys). Each event has several attributes: `timestamp`, `activity`, `resource`, `department`, `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `additional_info`. We will use these attributes to identify potential case groupings.

## Step 2: Identify Key Attributes for Case Grouping
The key to grouping events into cases lies in identifying attributes that remain consistent throughout a patient's journey and can distinguish one patient's journey from another. `patient_age` and `patient_gender` are potential attributes because they are likely to be consistent for a patient across different events. `department` and `activity` can indicate the progression of a patient's treatment, and `timestamp` can help understand the sequence and timing of events.

## Step 3: Analyze Event Sequence and Attributes
Let's start by analyzing the given events:
1. Events 1, 2, and 3 are "Register patient" activities in different departments (ER and Surgery) with different patient demographics.
2. Events 4, 5 are "Initial triage" for patients in ER, with `patient_age` and `patient_gender` matching events 1 and 2, respectively.
3. Subsequent events continue various activities (e.g., "Doctor consultation", "X-ray imaging", "Lab test requested") that can be linked back to the initial registration based on `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `department`.

## Step 4: Group Events Based on Attributes
To group events, we look for consistent `patient_age` and `patient_gender` across events and consider the department and activity sequence. For instance:
- Event 1 (`patient_age=45`, `patient_gender=M`) is followed by Event 4 (`patient_age=45`, `patient_gender=M`), indicating they are likely part of the same case.
- Event 7 (`patient_age=45`, `patient_gender=M`) continues this case.
- Event 12 (`patient_age=45`, `patient_gender=M`) further continues this case, and Event 15 (`patient_age=45`, `patient_gender=M`) concludes it.

## Step 5: Apply Grouping to All Events
1. Case 1: Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 (`patient_age=45`, `patient_gender=M`, department initially ER) - Register, Initial triage, X-ray, Doctor consultation, Discharge.
2. Case 2: Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 (`patient_age=62`, `patient_gender=F`, department=ER) - Register, Initial triage, Lab test requested, Lab test completed, Doctor consultation, Prescription, Discharge.
3. Case 3: Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 (`patient_age=28`, `patient_gender=M`, department initially Surgery) - Register, Doctor consultation, Surgery preparation, Surgery performed, Recovery room, Discharge.

## Step 6: Validate the Grouping
- Case 1: Starts with registration in ER, followed by triage, X-ray, doctor consultation, and ends with discharge, which is a plausible patient journey.
- Case 2: Begins with ER registration, followed by triage, lab tests, doctor consultation, prescription, and discharge, also a plausible journey.
- Case 3: Involves registration in Surgery, doctor consultation, surgery preparation, surgery, recovery, and discharge, consistent with a surgical patient journey.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$
