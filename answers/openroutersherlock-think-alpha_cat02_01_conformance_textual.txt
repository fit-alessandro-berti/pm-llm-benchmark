### Violating Cases
The following cases deviate from the normative process: **Case 2**, **Case 3**, and **Case 5**.

**Cases 1** and **Case 4** conform to the normative process:
- Case 1 follows the exact normal flow for sufficient inventory: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- Case 4 follows the exact cancellation flow for insufficient inventory: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.

### Violations Explained

#### Case 2
- **Package items** occurs *before* **Authorize payment** (Package at 10:00, Authorize at 10:30).
- This violates the constraint that **Authorize payment** must occur "after 'Check inventory' and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known" and "**Package items** should only occur after authorization and before shipping." Packaging before payment authorization skips the required validation of the customer's payment method, which is illogical per the description.
- Although **Ship order** follows **Package items** (which is correct in isolation), the overall sequence disrupts the expected progression, as fulfillment steps are out of order relative to payment authorization.

#### Case 3
- **Authorize payment** occurs (at 09:40), followed by **Cancel order** (at 10:00), which does not align with either flow. The description specifies that if inventory is insufficient, the process "must branch into a cancellation scenario... directly proceed to 'Cancel order'" after Check inventory—without intervening fulfillment steps like authorization. Authorizing payment here implies proceeding under the sufficient-inventory assumption, making the subsequent cancellation a deviation.
- **Ship order** occurs *after* **Cancel order** (Ship at 10:30), directly violating the rule that "**Ship order** should only occur after packaging and *never after a cancellation*." The description emphasizes it is "illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)" after cancellation.
- **Close order** is final (correct), but the prior steps break both the normal and cancellation sequences.

#### Case 5
- **Ship order** occurs *before* **Package items** (Ship at 11:00, with no Package recorded at all).
- This skips **Package items** entirely, violating the requirement that "**Package items** should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped" and "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" Shipping without packaging is a clear fulfillment deviation in the normal flow (sufficient inventory is implied by authorization and shipping).
- The sequence otherwise starts correctly (Receive  Check  Authorize  Close), but omits the mandatory preparation step.
