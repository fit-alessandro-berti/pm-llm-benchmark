In order to identify potentially sensitive attributes in the context of fair data practices, we need to look at whether these attributes could lead to discrimination against certain groups. Here's a breakdown of some common sensitivity categories based on typical industry standards:

1. **Demographic Attributes:**
   - For demographic-based screening and screening methods, features like age (especially if it is explicitly measured), gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, and other potentially sensitive attributes may raise concerns.

2. **Socioeconomic Status:**
   - Income, whether reported or derived from utility charges, and credit scores can be seen as indicators of socio-economic status, which might subject certain applicants to unfair screening practices, such as denial or discrimination based on their socioeconomic background.

3. **Credit History:**
   - Including mortgage histories, bankruptcies, or delinquency rates (e.g., late payments) which are often used in real estate screening tools can lead to discriminatory decisions against those with a history of poor financial stability, potentially affecting individuals from financially unstable backgrounds.

4. **Other Data Considered Sensitive by Industry:**
   - Occupation type and level of education might also be classified as sensitive attributes; these could influence hiring practices or lease agreements.

Without looking at specific screeners and their particular use cases for fairness, it is generally recommended to avoid collecting or using demographic-based categories such as race, gender identity, age in a way that would cause discrimination. Instead, real estate transactions should prefer more general information about rental property preferences like living areas, amenities, etc., unless those are proven less valuable ways of determining creditworthiness or rental capacity.

Ultimately, identifying any attributes which may lead to bias requires context and careful analysis: If such categories were found in the dataset, it would be worth reviewing this data for bias and ensuring that all decisions made do not inherently favor any specific demographic.
