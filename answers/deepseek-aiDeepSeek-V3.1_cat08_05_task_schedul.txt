Of course. As a Senior Operations Analyst specializing in manufacturing optimization, I will outline a comprehensive, data-driven approach for Precision Parts Inc. that leverages process mining to diagnose issues and prescribe advanced scheduling solutions.

### **Executive Summary**

The challenges at Precision Parts Inc. stem from a reactive, myopic scheduling approach ill-suited for a complex, dynamic job shop. By applying advanced process mining to the rich MES event logs, we can move from symptomatic treatment to a root-cause understanding of scheduling pathologies. This analysis will inform the development of dynamic, predictive, and optimized scheduling strategies, which will be rigorously tested via simulation. A framework for continuous improvement will ensure the scheduling system remains resilient and effective over time.

### **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

I will use process mining not just to discover a process model, but to perform deep-dashbo conformance checking and performance analysis.

*   **Reconstructing Job Flow:** Using a tool like Celonis, Disco, or Prom, I will ingest the event logs. The primary case identifier is `Case ID (Job ID)`, and the activity is `Activity/Task`. The timestamps allow for reconstruction of the exact sequence and timing of events for each job, creating a "digital twin" of the shop floor's historical performance.

*   **Quantifying Key Metrics:**
    *   **Job Flow/Lead Times & Makespan:** Simple process mining dashboards will calculate the time between `Job Released` and the final `Task End` for each job, providing distributions of total lead time. Makespan for a set of jobs (e.g., per day) is calculated from the first job release to the last job completion.
    *   **Waiting/Queue Times:** By analyzing the time difference between `Queue Entry` and `Task Start` events for each activity, I can calculate average, median, and maximum waiting times per machine (e.g., `MILL-03`). This directly quantifies WIP and congestion.
    *   **Resource Utilization:** By aggregating all events for a specific `Resource (Machine ID)`, I can calculate:
        *   **Productive Time:** Sum of all `Task Duration (Actual)`.
        *   **Setup Time:** Sum of all time between `Setup Start` and `Setup End`.
        *   **Idle Time:** Time between a `Task End` and the next `Setup Start` or `Task Start` (indicating the machine was available but no job was being processed).
        *   **Breakdown Time:** Time during `Breakdown Start` events.
        *   Utilization is then: `(Productive Time + Setup Time) / Total Available Time`.
    *   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** This is a critical analysis. I will:
        1.  For each machine, extract every job sequence (JOB-A -> JOB-B -> JOB-C).
        2.  For each transition (A->B, B->C), calculate the actual setup time from the logs (`Setup End` - `Setup Start`).
        3.  Build a **Setup Matrix** for each machine, where rows and columns are job types (categorized by material, required tools, complexity from `Notes`), and the cell values are the average setup time for that specific transition. This matrix is a direct data-driven input for optimized scheduling.
    *   **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:** By comparing the actual completion time (last `Task End`) with the `Order Due Date` for each job, I can calculate tardiness (max(0, completion_date - due_date)). I will analyze the distribution, frequency (% of late jobs), and average magnitude of tardiness.
    *   **Impact of Disruptions:** Using timestamps from disruptive events (e.g., `Breakdown Start` on `MILL-02`), I will perform a "before-and-after" analysis. For instance, I will compare the average waiting time and lead time for jobs that were in the system during the `MILL-02` breakdown versus those that were not, using statistical tests to quantify the disruption's impact.

### **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

The performance analysis will reveal specific, evidence-based inefficiencies.

*   **Bottleneck Identification:** Applying bottleneck analysis algorithms (e.g., exploring waiting times, active periods), I will identify machines with the longest average active period and highest utilization *coupled with* the longest downstream queue times. For example, the analysis might show that `HEAT-01` operates at 95% utilization and has a average queue of 12 hours, making it the primary bottleneck throttling entire system throughput.
*   **Poor Prioritization Evidence:** Through variant analysis, I will compare the flow of jobs that were completed on-time versus those that were late. I may discover that the current "First-Come-First-Served" rule often processes low-priority, long jobs ahead of high-priority ones, evident in the event sequences. A scatter plot of "job priority vs. waiting time" might show no correlation, proving prioritization is ineffective.
*   **Suboptimal Sequencing:** By analyzing the actual sequences on high-utilization machines and simulating alternative sequences using the historical Setup Matrix, I can quantify the "excess" or "wasted" setup time. For instance, the log might show a sequence like [Stainless, Aluminum, Stainless] on a lathe, requiring two long setup changes, whereas a [Stainless, Stainless, Aluminum] sequence would have minimized total setup time.
*   **Starvation and Bullwhip Effect:** By creating a visualization of WIP levels over time at each workstation, I can identify periods where downstream machines are starved. Correlating this with events at upstream bottlenecks will show how a delay at one machine creates a surge of WIP followed by a famine downstream—a classic bullwhip effect caused by poor scheduling coordination.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

Process mining helps differentiate between **planning flaws** and **execution variability**.

*   **Limitations of Static Rules:** The analysis will show that simple rules like EDD are easily disrupted. A job with a distant due date might be scheduled, but its long processing time blocks a urgent job that arrives later, a fact visible in the timeline.
*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** The reconstructed models will show jobs waiting at empty queues because the scheduler was unaware a machine had just become available, or jobs being sent to a known bottleneck because its current queue length wasn't considered.
*   **Inaccurate Estimations:** Comparing `Task Duration (Planned)` vs. `(Actual)` across all activities will reveal systematic biases (e.g., grinding times are consistently underestimated by 15%). This is a planning input problem, not a scheduling logic problem.
*   **Ineffective Setup Handling:** The very existence of a highly variable Setup Matrix that isn't used in scheduling is a root cause. The scheduler treats all setups as equal or ignores them.
*   **Poor Disruption Response:** The log will show that after a breakdown, the system often continues with the pre-existing schedule instead of dynamically re-sequencing to mitigate the disruption's impact.

**Process mining differentiates causes by:** Is the observed delay due to a job waiting behind another job that *should not have been prioritized* (scheduling logic flaw)? Or is it because the machine was down (resource capacity/availability issue)? Or because the task simply took much longer than anyone could reasonably predict (inherent variability)? Filtering and segmenting the log data answers these questions.

### **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic, Weighted Composite Dispatching Rule**

*   **Core Logic:** Instead of a single rule (e.g., EDD), each time a machine becomes free, a score is calculated for every job in its queue. The job with the best score is selected. The score is a weighted sum of multiple factors:
    *   `Critical Ratio = (Due Date - Current Time) / Remaining Processing Time` (prioritizes urgent jobs with little work left).
    *   `Job Priority` (a numerical value for High, Medium, Low).
    *   `Downstream Machine Load` (the total processing time in the queue of the next machine this job will visit).
    *   `Estimated Setup Time` (pulled from the historical Setup Matrix based on the current job on the machine and the candidate job).
*   **Process Mining Insight:** The weights for each factor are not guessed; they are **optimized via regression analysis** on the historical log. We would model what factor combination in the past would have led to the best outcomes (lowest tardiness, highest utilization).
*   **Addresses:** Poor prioritization, ignorance of downstream state, and setup times.
*   **Expected Impact:** Reduction in average and maximum tardiness, better flow for high-priority jobs, slight improvement in utilization via setup reduction.

#### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Digital Twin Simulation**

*   **Core Logic:** A higher-level scheduler runs a lightweight, real-time discrete-event simulation (digital twin) of the shop floor. When a new job arrives or a disruption occurs, the scheduler evaluates multiple candidate scheduling decisions by simulating them forward in time minutes or hours, using predictive models for task durations and setup times. It chooses the decision that leads to the best predicted KPI outcome.
*   **Process Mining Insight:** The simulation model is **parameterized entirely from process mining**:
    *   Task duration distributions (mined from `Task Duration (Actual)`).
    *   Routing probabilities (from the historical flow).
    *   Setup time distributions (from the Setup Matrix).
    *   Machine failure MTBF and MTTR (from `Breakdown` events).
*   **Addresses:** Inaccurate estimations, lack of holistic visibility, poor disruption response. It proactively tests strategies instead of reacting.
*   **Expected Impact:** Significant improvement in schedule predictability and robustness, major reduction in lead time variability, and better handling of disruptions and hot jobs.

#### **Strategy 3: Setup-Optimized Sequencing at Bottlenecks**

*   **Core Logic:** For the identified bottleneck resources (e.g., `HEAT-01`), we implement a separate, optimized scheduling logic. This scheduler uses a **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** analogy, where the "cities" are jobs and the "distance" is the setup time between them. The goal is to find the sequence that minimizes total setup time for a given set of jobs in the queue.
*   **Process Mining Insight:** The "distance matrix" for the TSP is the **historical Setup Matrix** mined from the logs. This ensures the optimization is based on real-world data.
*   **Addresses:** The primary root cause of excessive setup time on the constraining resource. This directly increases the effective capacity of the bottleneck.
*   **Expected Impact:** Greatest increase in bottleneck throughput and overall system capacity. Direct reduction in WIP waiting at the bottleneck. This is the most powerful strategy for improving overall throughput.

### **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

*   **Simulation-Based Evaluation:**
    *   I will build a high-fidelity discrete-event simulation model (e.g., in Arena, Simio, Python) using the distributions, probabilities, and rules mined from the historical log. This model is the **baseline**.
    *   I will then implement the three proposed strategies (and combinations thereof) into the model.
    *   **Test Scenarios:**
        *   **Steady-State:** Normal load conditions.
        *   **High Load:** 90%+ utilization period to stress-test the systems.
        *   **Disruption-Rich:** High frequency of machine failures and urgent order insertion.
    *   Each scenario will be run for multiple replications to obtain statistically significant results for comparison on KPIs: **Mean Tardiness, % Tardy Jobs, Mean Flow Time, WIP Levels, and Bottleneck Utilization.**

*   **Framework for Continuous Improvement:**
    *   **Deploy:** Implement the best-performing strategy from the simulation.
    *   **Monitor:** Establish a daily/weekly process mining dashboard that automatically ingests new MES events and tracks the same KPIs used in the analysis (tardiness, utilization, queue times).
    *   **Detect:** Use control charts on these KPIs to automatically detect negative drifts (e.g., average tardiness steadily increasing). Process mining can also periodically re-run variant analysis to detect new, inefficient patterns of behavior.
    *   **Adapt:** If performance degrades, the process mining and simulation engine are re-engaged. The new log data is analyzed to see if the Setup Matrix has changed, if new bottlenecks have emerged, or if task distributions have shifted. The scheduling strategies (e.g., the weights in Strategy 1) are then re-calibrated and re-tested in simulation before being redeployed. This creates a closed-loop, self-optimizing scheduling system.
