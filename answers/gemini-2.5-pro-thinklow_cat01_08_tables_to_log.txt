Of course. Here is the comprehensive event log created by integrating the provided ERP data tables, suitable for process mining.

### Assumptions Made

1.  **Case ID**: The `order_id` is used as the unique identifier for each process instance (case), as requested.
2.  **Event Granularity**:
    -   **Item Picking**: Since each line item has its own picking timestamp and resource (`picker_id`), each one is treated as a distinct "Item Picked" event. This level of detail can reveal bottlenecks or concurrency in the warehouse.
    -   **Delivery**: Each row in the `Delivery` table generates two separate events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived", as they represent distinct milestones in the process with their own timestamps.
    -   **Multi-step Records**: All other tables (`Orders`, `Invoice`, `Payments`) are treated as generating one event per row.
3.  **Resource Mapping**: The `Resource` column is populated with the name of the person, department, or company responsible for the activity. This information is derived by joining the various ID fields (e.g., `sales_person_id`, `picker_id`, `carrier_id`, `billing_person_id`) with the `Resources` table. For "Payment Received" events, where no specific resource ID is provided, this column is left blank.
4.  **Attribute Column**: A `Details` column has been added to capture relevant event-specific attributes, such as `item_id`, `quantity`, `invoice_amount`, or `payment_method`. This enriches the log without creating an excessive number of columns.
5.  **Data Linkage**: The `Payments` table was linked to its corresponding `order_id` by joining it with the `Invoice` table (`Payments.invoice_id` -> `Invoice.invoice_id` -> `Invoice.order_id`).

### Final Integrated Event Log

The following table presents the final event log, structured with one row per event. The log is sorted first by **Case ID** and then chronologically by **Timestamp**.

| Case ID | Activity          | Timestamp            | Resource          | Details                                                            |
