Of course. Here is the comprehensive event log generated by integrating the provided ERP tables, along with a summary of the assumptions made during the process.

### Assumptions Made

1.  **Case ID**: The `order_id` is used as the unique identifier for each process instance (case), as specified.
2.  **Activity Granularity**:
    *   **Item Picking**: Each row in the `Order Lines` table is treated as a distinct "Item Picked" event, as each has its own timestamp and resource (`picker_id`). This provides a more detailed view of the warehouse operations.
    *   **Delivery**: Each row in the `Delivery` table generates two distinct events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived", using their respective timestamps. This is crucial because there's a time lag between them, and they represent different stages of the logistics process.
3.  **Resource Mapping**: The `resource_id` from each source table has been mapped to the `resource_name` from the `Resources` table to provide more readable actor information. For "Payment Received" events, a resource is not specified in the source table, so this field is left empty.
4.  **Attribute Consolidation**: To keep the log clean, relevant event-specific data (like `invoice_id`, `item_id`, `quantity`, `payment_method`, etc.) has been consolidated into a single `Details` column. For "Item Picked" events, the `item_category` from the `Products` table has been included for extra context.
5.  **Chronological Ordering**: The final event log is sorted chronologically by the `Timestamp` column to reflect the true sequence of events as they occurred across all cases.
