============================================================
1.  NORMATIVE (STRICT-RULE) COMPLIANCE CHECK  
============================================================

Case 1 – Compliant  
• All mandatory activities are present.  
• Every ordering constraint is respected (Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalise Documentation  Close Case after an approval).  
 No normative violations.

Case 2 – NON-Compliant  
a. Wrong order: “Risk Assessment” is logged before “Credit Check”.  
b. Skipped mandatory step: no “Inform Applicant” after the decision.  
c. Forbidden action: “Finalize Documentation” is performed even though the decision is “Rejected”.  
 Three separate violations of the normative model.

Case 3 – Compliant  
• Activities appear in the correct order and the branch for “Approved” is followed correctly (Finalize Documentation before closing).  
 No violations of the strict rules.


============================================================
2.  DESIDERATA (GOOD-PRACTICE) CHECK  
============================================================

Timing recommendations  
• Credit Check  24 h after Application  
• Inform Applicant  48 h after Decision  
• Optional but recommended: Follow-up Call before closing

Case 1 – Minor deviations  
 Credit Check done in 0.5 h (OK)  
 Inform Applicant done in 2 h (OK)  
 No Follow-up Call (desideratum not met)

Case 2 – Minor deviations in addition to the hard errors  
 Credit Check eventually occurs within 24 h (but ordering is already wrong – normative error)  
 No Inform Applicant at all (already a strict error, also breaks the timing desideratum)  
 No Follow-up Call

Case 3 – Minor deviations  
 Credit Check occurs ~49 h after Application (exceeds the 24 h recommendation)  
 Inform Applicant occurs ~51 h after Decision (exceeds 48 h recommendation)  
 No Follow-up Call

Summary of desiderata breaches  
• Follow-up Call missing in all three cases.  
• Slow Credit Check (Case 3).  
• Slow Inform Applicant (Case 3).  
• All timing/desiderata respected in Case 1 apart from the missing call.


============================================================
3.  POSSIBLE INTERPRETATIONS / JUSTIFICATIONS  
============================================================

Case 1  
The trace is exemplary with respect to the mandatory workflow. The only absence—a Follow-up Call—might indicate that the organisation relies on the written notification and considers an additional call unnecessary for straightforward approvals.

Case 2  
The out-of-order Risk Assessment suggests either (a) a data-entry mistake (the log order does not reflect the real work order) or (b) a procedural shortcut where the risk analyst started work before the credit team finished. In either case, doing Finalise Documentation after a rejection is clearly wrong; it could be the result of re-using the same sub-procedure for both outcomes without the correct branch check. Missing “Inform Applicant” might stem from the same oversight—the case may have been auto-closed by a batch script once documentation was (incorrectly) finalised.

Case 3  
All mandatory steps are correct, so the delays are most plausibly operational issues: high workload, missing data from the applicant, staff shortages over a weekend, etc. The organisation could monitor SLA dashboards to flag Credit Checks that approach the 24-hour limit and Decision notifications that near 48 h. Again, no Follow-up Call suggests it is not yet embedded as a standard practice.

============================================================
4.  ACTIONABLE TAKE-AWAYS  
============================================================

Strict control  
• Case 2 requires immediate remediation; it breaks core compliance rules.  
• Introduce automated checks in the workflow engine to prevent:  
  – Risk Assessment starting before a completed Credit Check.  
  – Finalise Documentation being allowed after a “Rejected” decision.  
  – Closing a case without an “Inform Applicant” entry.

Good-practice improvement  
• Add SLA alerts:  
  – Credit Check > 24 h after Application.  
  – Inform Applicant > 48 h after Decision.  
• Update the standard operating procedure to include a Follow-up Call task with a soft due date before closing.  
• Provide staff with a dashboard highlighting near-due desiderata so they can act proactively rather than retrospectively.

============================================================
Overall verdict  
• Normative rule breaches: only Case 2.  
• Desiderata breaches: all cases (Case 1 minor, Case 3 several timing issues, Case 2 covered by its larger problems).
