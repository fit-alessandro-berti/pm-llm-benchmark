Here’s the updated `declare_model` with added constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application review process, along with a brief explanation for each added constraint:

### **Updated declare_model**

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        "ManualReview": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "FinalDecision": {
            "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "B bias in decision-making:

1. **Coexistence of Manual Reviews with Decisions on Sensitive Demographics**:
By requiring `ManualReview` to coexist with decisions (`Approve`, `Reject`) involving sensitive demographics (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`), we ensure that decisions are subject to additional scrutiny to prevent bias.
2. **Response Constraints for Bias Checks**:
Ensuring that a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity occurs before a decision step (`FinalDecision`) mitigates the risk of immediate decisions being influenced by sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`). This helps prevent biased sequences like `CheckApplicantRace`  `Reject`.
3. **Non-succession Between Sensitive Checks and Discriminatory Decisions**:
Preventing direct succession between sensitive attribute checks (`CheckApplicantRace`) and biased outcomes (`Reject`) ensures that a decision is not made solely based on sensitive attributes. This forces intermediate steps (e.g., further reviews or mitigation checks) to reduce bias.
4. **Precedence of Non-sensitive Checks for Rejections**:
Requiring `BiasMitigationCheck` to precede `Reject` ensures fairness by enforcing additional reviews on potentially biased rejection decisions.

These changes work together to reduce the likelihood of decisions being unfairly influenced by sensitive applicant attributes and to provide transparency and fairness in the loan application review process.
