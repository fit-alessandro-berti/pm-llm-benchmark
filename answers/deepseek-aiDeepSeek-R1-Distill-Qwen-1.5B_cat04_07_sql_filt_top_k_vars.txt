Okay, I need to tackle this problem step by step. Let me go through each part of the prompt one by one.

First, the task is to construct a SQL query for DuckDB. The goal is to determine the sequence of activities for each case_id. So, I think I need to group the events by case_id and then order each group by timestamp. DuckDB's window functions might be useful here. I can use the window function with order by timestamp to get the sorted order of activities.

Next, I need to group cases by their complete activity sequence. That means for each sequence, I have to count how many times each unique sequence appears. This sounds like a SQL COUNT on the activity sequence. So, I should create a temporary table or use a subquery to capture each unique activity sequence and its count.

Then, the third part is to count how many cases correspond to each variant. This is straightforward—group the cases by their activity sequence and count the number of cases per sequence. This will give the frequency of each variant.

Finally, I need to determine the top K variants based on their frequency. I'll sort these variants in descending order of frequency. Once I have the top K, I need to return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. This requires joining the original data with the resulting counts and filtering based on the variant's inclusion in the top K.

I should also make sure that the queries are efficient and don't cause any performance issues. DuckDB is optimized for such operations, but I need to be cautious about the data size and how I structure the queries.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each case_id, sort the activities by timestamp to get the sequence.
2. Group cases by their activity sequences and count occurrences.
3. Group the cases by their activity sequences and count the cases per variant.
4. Sort the variants by frequency in descending order.
5. Join the original event log with the top K cases and extract the relevant events.

I think I can use window functions to get the activity sequence for each case. Then, use COUNT on the sequence to group them. For filtering, I'll join the data with the results of step 4 and apply an ON clause to include only cases that are part of the top K variants.

I should also consider if there are any edge cases, like varying case_id values or activity types. But for now, the SQL structure should handle these as long as the queries are correctly scoped.

Alright, I think I have a plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the SQL queries step by step, making sure each part is handled correctly.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze an event log stored in a DuckDB table and identify unique process variants based on the sorted activities within each case. The solution involves several steps, including extracting the activity sequence, grouping cases by their complete activity sequence, counting cases per variant, and filtering events based on the top K variants.

### Step 1: Extract the Activity Sequence for Each Case
We start by grouping the events by `case_id` and ordering the activities within each group by their `timestamp`. This will give us the ordered sequence of activities for each case.

```sql
WITH activity_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    ORDER BY timestamp
)
```

### Step 2: Group Cases by Their Complete Activity Sequence
Next, we group the cases by their complete activity sequence and count the occurrences of each unique sequence.

```sql
SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(case_id) AS case_count
FROM activity_sequences
GROUP BY activity_sequence
```

### Step 3: Count Cases per Variant
We then group the cases by their activity sequence and count the number of cases per variant.

```sql
SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(case_id) AS variant_count
FROM activity_sequences
GROUP BY activity_sequence
ORDER BY variant_count DESC
```

### Step 4: Determine the Top K Variants
We sort the variants by their frequency in descending order and select the top K variants.

```sql
SELECT activity_sequence, variant_count, Rank(variant_count) 
FROM activity_sequences
GROUP BY activity_sequence
ORDER BY variant_count DESC
```

### Step 5: Filter Events for the Top K Cases
Finally, we join the original event log with the top K cases and extract the relevant events.

```sql
SELECT event_log.* 
FROM event_log
JOIN (
    SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(case_id) AS variant_count
    FROM activity_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
) AS top_k_variants
WHERE variant_count IN (SELECT top_k_variants.*, RANK(variant_count) = K)
ORDER BY variant_count DESC
```

### Explanation
1. **Extracting Activity Sequence**: The `activity_sequences` CTE (Common Table Expression) groups the events by `case_id` and orders the activities within each case by their `timestamp`.

2. **Grouping by Activity Sequence**: The second CTE groups the cases by their activity sequence and counts how many times each sequence appears.

3. **Counting Cases per Variant**: The third CTE groups the cases by their activity sequence and counts the number of cases per variant.

4. **Sorting Variants**: The final query sorts the variants by their frequency in descending order and selects the top K variants.

5. **Filtering Events**: The main query joins the original event log with the top K cases and includes only the events that belong to these cases.

This approach efficiently identifies and extracts the required information to solve the problem.
