Based on the provided interview transcripts, here is a textual representation of the Invoice Approval Process:

1. **Invoice Received (Start Event)**: The process begins when an invoice is received by the Accounts Payable department.

2. **Check for Purchase Order (Task)**: Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk, checks if the invoice is associated with a valid purchase order number.

3. **No Purchase Order (Decision)**: If the invoice does not have a PO, Mary sends it back to the supplier requesting more details.

4. **Log Invoice (Task)**: If the invoice has a PO, Mary logs it into the accounting system.

5. **Forward to Purchasing (Task)**: Mary forwards the invoice to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received.

6. **Confirm Receipt (Task)**: Dan, the Purchasing Officer, checks if the invoice details line up with what was ordered. He opens up the PO and compares quantities, prices, and any delivery charges. If something is off, he either contacts the supplier directly or asks Mary to hold the invoice until the supplier sends a corrected version. If everything is correct, he sends a confirmation email back to Accounts Payable.

7. **Match Invoice to PO (Task)**: After receipt confirmation, Mary matches the invoice line items against the PO in the system.

8. **Discrepancy (Decision)**: If there is a discrepancy, like incorrect pricing or missing items, Mary emails the purchasing team to clarify. If the discrepancy can’t be resolved easily, she escalates it to her supervisor, Rita.

9. **Approval Request (Task)**: Once all issues are resolved, the system sends an automatic email requesting the department manager's sign-off.

10. **Manager Approval (Decision)**: Carlos, the Department Manager, approves or rejects the invoice based on whether the invoice details, the PO, and the confirmation look good. If suspicious, he might reject it or ask Mary to hold it and investigate further.

11. **Schedule Payment (Task)**: After approval, the invoice goes back to Accounts Payable for scheduling the payment run.

12. **Exception Resolution (Sub-process)**: If Mary or Dan encounter issues that they can't resolve, they escalate to Rita, the Accounts Payable Supervisor. She contacts suppliers, coordinates between departments, and ensures problem invoices don’t get stuck indefinitely.

13. **Payment Scheduled (End Event)**: The process ends when the payment is scheduled.

**Roles/Participants**: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), and Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**: Invoice, Purchase Order (PO), Email notifications, Confirmation emails.

**Exceptions/Variations**: The process may return to the 'Discrepancy' decision point if the invoice needs to be reviewed again due to unresolved discrepancies. If there is no PO, the process returns to the 'No Purchase Order' decision point. The 'Exception Resolution' sub-process can be triggered at any point if an issue arises that cannot be resolved by Mary or Dan.
