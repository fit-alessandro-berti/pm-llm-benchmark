**Task 1: Identified Violating Cases**

Based on the normative process description and the provided event log, the following cases violate the intended process flow:

* **Case 2**
* **Case 3**
* **Case 5** (partial violation, as it skips a critical step without clear justification)

**Task 2: Explanation of Violations**

### Case 2 Violations:

* **Activity Sequence Violation:** The activities are performed in the following order: Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items**  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
* **Rule Violated:** According to the normative description, "Authorize payment" should occur **before** "Package items" since payment authorization must happen after confirming inventory sufficiency and before preparing items for shipment.
* **Interpretation:** This deviation suggests a misunderstanding of the dependency between payment authorization and item packaging. Payment should be authorized to ensure validity before incurring packaging costs or logistical preparations.

### Case 3 Violations:

* **Activity Sequence Violation:** The sequence is: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order**  **Ship order**  Close order.
* **Rules Violated:**
	1. **Cancellation and Shipping Incompatibility:** After an order is canceled, it is illogical and contradictory to then "Ship order". Cancellation should conclude with "Close order" without intermediate fulfillment activities.
	2. **Misplacement of Ship Order:** Shipping should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation, indicating a severe process flow error.
* **Interpretation:** This case demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of the cancellation workflow, potentially leading to unnecessary costs or customer confusion. Once an order is canceled, no further fulfillment actions should be taken.

### Case 5 Partial Violation:

* **Potential Activity Omission or Sequence Violation:** The sequence provided is: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
* **Potential Rule Violated:** The normative process implies that **"Package items"** should occur **after** "Authorize payment" and **before** "Ship order". Case 5 seems to skip the "Package items" step without indication of an exception or special circumstances that might justify this omission.
* **Interpretation:** While not explicitly violating a "do not" rule, Case 5's sequence omission raises questions about adherence to the implied process flow, particularly regarding the preparation of items for shipping. However, without explicit prohibition against skipping packaging under certain conditions, this is classified as a partial violation, highlighting a potential process ambiguity or omission rather than a clear rule violation.
