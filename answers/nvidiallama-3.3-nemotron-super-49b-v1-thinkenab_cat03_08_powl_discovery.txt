Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to create a POWL model based on the given event log. POWL uses transitions (activities), silent transitions, choice (X), loops (*), and partial orders. I need to analyze the event log structure to identify the control flow, sequences, choices, loops, and concurrency.

First, I'll look at the key activities and their order in the cases. Let's go through each activity step by step.

Starting with the beginning: OR (Order Received) is always the first activity in every case. So OR must be the initial node with no predecessors. Then comes MS (Material Sourcing), QS (Quality Screening), AS (Assembly). These seem to follow in sequence: OR  MS  QS  AS. All cases start with this sequence, so that's a strict order.

Next after AS is IQC (In-line Quality Check). Looking at the logs, IQC is repeated multiple times in some cases (like Case 3 and 5). For example, in Case 3, after AS, IQC is done three times with AS in between. Wait, no: looking closer, after AS, there's IQC, then AS again, then IQC, etc. That suggests a loop where IQC and AS are repeated. Wait, but how? Let me check the sequence:

Case 3:
- AS at 10:00
- IQC at 10:15
- AS at 10:45 (after another IQC at 10:30)
Wait, no. Let me parse Case 3's steps:

Case 3's activities after AS (10:00):
10:15 IQC
10:30 IQC again
10:45 AS
11:00 IQC
11:15 AS
Then TST.

Hmm, so after the initial AS, there are IQC rounds followed by AS again. It looks like a loop where after AS, IQC is done, then back to AS, and this can repeat. Wait, but in Case 3, after the first AS, there are two IQCs followed by AS, then IQC again, then AS. So maybe the loop involves IQC and AS in a sequence that can repeat. Or perhaps IQC is part of a loop that can be repeated after AS.

Alternatively, perhaps after AS, there's a loop that repeats IQC followed by AS until some condition (maybe until IQC passes?), then proceed to TST. Let's look at the flow:

In Case 1: AS  IQC  AS  TST (no loop back to IQC after the second AS). Wait, in Case 1:

AS at 10:00, then IQC at 10:15, then AS at 10:30, then TST at 11:00. So after the second AS, it goes to TST. So maybe after the first AS, there's an IQC, then AS again, and then either proceed to TST or loop back to IQC again. But in Case 1, after the second AS, it proceeds to TST. In Case 3, after AS, IQC is done multiple times with AS in between. So perhaps the structure is: after AS, there's a loop where IQC is executed, then AS, and this loop can repeat until decided to exit.

Wait, maybe the loop is between IQC and AS. So the loop would be: execute IQC, then AS, and then either exit the loop or repeat. But in Case 3, there are multiple IQCs and AS in alternation. Let's see:

Case 3:
1. AS (10:00)
2. IQC (10:15)
3. IQC (10:30)
4. AS (10:45)
5. IQC (11:00)
6. AS (11:15)
Then TST.

So after the initial AS, there's IQC, then another IQC (without AS in between?), then AS, then IQC, then AS. This seems inconsistent. Maybe the logging has some variations, but perhaps the intended structure is that after AS, IQC can be performed multiple times with AS in between. Alternatively, maybe the loop is such that after AS, you can do IQC and then either exit or do AS again and loop back. But the log entries are a bit confusing here.

Alternatively, maybe the loop is structured as a loop between IQC and AS. So the loop would be: after AS, you do IQC, then either exit or do AS again and repeat. But in the logs, sometimes after IQC, there's AS again, which would imply looping. However, in Case 1, after the first IQC and AS, it proceeds to TST without looping. So perhaps the loop allows for multiple iterations of IQC followed by AS, and after any AS, you can choose to exit or loop again.

This seems complicated. Let's model this part. Suppose after the initial AS, there's a loop where you can repeatedly do IQC followed by AS. The loop would be structured as * (A, B), where A is IQC and B is AS. Wait, but according to the POWL definition, a loop * (A, B) means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So in this case, maybe the loop is * (IQC, AS). So first IQC is executed, then you can choose to exit (proceed to TST) or execute AS and then loop back to IQC again.

But looking at Case 3: after the initial AS, there are two IQCs followed by AS, then IQC, then AS. So the sequence would be:

AS (initial)  IQC (loop entry)  [exit or B (AS)]  if B is chosen, then loop back to A (IQC). So the first IQC is part of the loop, then AS (B), then loop back to IQC (A) again. So in Case 3, after the initial AS, the loop runs twice: first IQC  AS  IQC  AS  exit.

Wait, but how does that sequence fit? Let's see:

Initial AS.

Loop starts with A (IQC). Then, after IQC, you can exit or do B (AS). If you do B (AS), then you loop back to A (IQC). So the sequence would be:

IQC (A)  exit  done.

Or IQC  AS (B)  IQC (A again)  exit.

Or IQC  AS  IQC  AS  exit.

So in Case 3, after the initial AS, the sequence is IQC, AS, IQC, AS, then exit to TST. So that would be two iterations of the loop: first IQC  AS  IQC  AS, then exit. Wait, but the loop structure * (A, B) would mean that after A, you can choose to exit or do B and then A again. So each loop iteration is A followed by optionally B and then back to A.

So for the loop * (IQC, AS), the possible executions are:

- IQC  exit.

- IQC  AS  IQC  exit.

- IQC  AS  IQC  AS  IQC  exit.

And so on.

Looking at Case 3's sequence after the initial AS:

IQC (10:15)  IQC (10:30)  AS (10:45)  IQC (11:00)  AS (11:15)  TST.

Wait, that doesn't fit the loop structure. Because after the first IQC (10:15), there's another IQC (10:30) without an AS in between. That suggests that maybe the loop is not correctly modeled as * (IQC, AS). Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the log, but assuming the log is correct, perhaps the loop is different.

Alternatively, maybe the loop is around AS and IQC in a different way. Let's think: after AS, you can do IQC and then either exit or do AS again and repeat. So the loop would be * (IQC, AS), where A is IQC and B is AS. So the loop body is IQC, then after that, you can choose to exit or do AS and then loop back to IQC.

In this case, the sequence in Case 3 would be:

Initial AS.

Loop:

1. IQC (10:15)  choose to do B (AS at 10:45? Wait, no. After IQC at 10:15, the next activity is IQC again at 10:30. That's confusing. Unless there's a silent transition or another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the loop is structured differently. Maybe after AS, there's a loop that allows IQC to be repeated any number of times before proceeding. For example, a loop * (IQC, silent), where after IQC, you can choose to exit or do a silent transition and loop back. But that doesn't fit the presence of AS in between.

Alternatively, maybe the loop involves both IQC and AS. For example, after AS, the process can loop between IQC and AS. So the loop would be * (IQC followed by AS, ...). But according to POWL's loop definition, the loop is between two sub-models A and B. So * (A, B) means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

So if A is IQC and B is AS, then the loop would first execute IQC, then decide to exit or do AS and then IQC again.

In Case 3, after the initial AS, the sequence is:

IQC  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST.

This doesn't fit the loop structure because after the first IQC, there's another IQC without an AS. So perhaps the log has an error, or my understanding is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the loop is around the entire AS and IQC sequence. Let's see: after the initial AS, the loop could be * ( [IQC, AS], ... ), but that's not how POWL loops work. POWL loops are between two sub-models A and B. So maybe the loop is * (A, B), where A is a sequence of IQC and AS, and B is something else. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a silent transition involved. Let's reconsider. After AS, the process can enter a loop where IQC is performed, followed by an optional AS (via a choice), and then loop back. But that would require a choice node after IQC.

Alternatively, maybe after AS, there's a choice to either proceed to TST or to do IQC and then loop back. But in the logs, after AS, sometimes IQC is done, sometimes not. Wait, no. Looking at the cases:

In Case 1: AS  IQC  AS  TST.

In Case 2: AS  TST (no IQC).

Wait, no. Looking at Case 2:

Case 2's activities after AS (10:10) are TST at 11:10. So no IQC. So maybe after AS, there's a choice between doing IQC (and possibly looping) or proceeding to TST.

Ah, that's a crucial point. In Case 2, after AS, they go directly to TST without any IQC. So the presence of IQC is optional. So after AS, there's a choice: either proceed to TST or enter a loop that involves IQC.

So the control flow after AS could be:

AS  [X (TST, Loop)]

Where the loop would handle the IQC repetitions.

But how to model the loop. Let's break it down.

After AS, the process can choose to either go to TST directly (XOR choice) or enter a loop. The loop would involve IQC and possibly AS again.

Wait, but in Case 1, after AS, they do IQC, then AS again, then TST. So maybe the loop allows for multiple IQC executions with AS in between.

Alternatively, the loop could be structured as follows: after AS, you can loop between IQC and AS. So the loop is * (IQC, AS), meaning first IQC, then optionally AS and loop back.

But in Case 1, after the initial AS, they do IQC, then AS, then TST. So that would be one iteration of the loop: IQC (A)  AS (B)  exit.

In Case 3, after AS, they do IQC, IQC, AS, IQC, AS, then TST. That suggests that after the first IQC, they might have another IQC without an AS, which doesn't fit the loop structure. Unless there's a mistake in the log, perhaps the correct sequence should be IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST. But according to the log, there are two IQCs in a row, which complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the loop is not correctly captured, and there's a different structure. Let's think differently.

Perhaps after AS, there's a loop that consists of IQC followed by an optional AS. So the loop could be * (IQC, [AS]), where [AS] is a choice to do AS or not. But POWL's loop operator requires two sub-models. So perhaps the loop is * (IQC, AS_XOR_skip), where AS_XOR_skip is a choice between AS and a silent transition.

Wait, that could work. So the loop would be * (IQC, XOR(AS, skip)). Then, each iteration of the loop starts with IQC, then after IQC, you can choose to do AS (and loop back) or skip (exit the loop).

In this case, in Case 1:

After AS, enter the loop.

First iteration: IQC  choose AS  loop back.

Second iteration: IQC  choose skip  exit loop.

Then proceed to TST.

But in Case 1's log, after the initial AS, there's one IQC, then AS, then TST. So that would be one iteration of the loop: IQC  AS  loop back? No, because after AS, the loop would restart with IQC again. But in Case 1, after AS, they go to TST. So perhaps the loop is entered once, doing IQC and then AS, then exiting.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the loop is structured as * (IQC, AS), meaning that after IQC, you can choose to exit or do AS and then IQC again.

So in Case 1:

AS  enter loop.

IQC (A)  choose to do B (AS)  loop back to A (IQC).

But in Case 1, after the initial AS, there's IQC, then AS, then TST. So that would be:

Loop iteration 1: IQC  AS (B)  loop back to IQC (A).

But then why doesn't it loop again? Unless after AS, the choice is to exit.

Wait, perhaps the loop is * (IQC, AS), and the execution can be:

IQC  exit (no B), leading to TST.

Or IQC  AS  IQC  exit.

Or IQC  AS  IQC  AS  exit.

So in Case 1, after AS, the loop is entered once: IQC  exit  TST.

But in the log, after AS, there's IQC and then AS again before TST. So that would require:

IQC (A)  AS (B)  then exit.

So the loop is executed once with B chosen.

But then why is there an AS after IQC? Because B is AS, so after A (IQC), doing B (AS) and then the loop restarts with A (IQC). But in Case 1, after AS, they proceed to TST, not IQC again.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the loop structure is not * (IQC, AS), but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the loop is around the entire AS and IQC sequence. But POWL's loop operator is between two sub-models. So perhaps the loop is * (SEQ(IQC, AS), ...), but that's not directly possible.

Alternatively, maybe after AS, there's a choice to either proceed to TST or to do IQC and then possibly loop back. So the structure after AS is:

AS  X (TST, LOOP)

Where LOOP is * (IQC, AS).

But then, in the loop, after IQC, you can choose to do AS (and loop back) or exit.

In Case 1:

AS  choose LOOP.

LOOP:

IQC (A)  choose B (AS)  loop back to A (IQC).

Then, in the next iteration, IQC  choose to exit.

So the sequence would be AS  IQC  AS  IQC  TST. But in the log, it's AS  IQC  AS  TST. So that doesn't match.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let's try a different approach. Let's outline the overall process structure.

The overall process seems to be:

1. OR  MS  QS  AS.

2. After AS, there's a loop involving IQC and possible repetitions, sometimes followed by AS again.

3. After exiting the loop, proceed to TST.

4. TST can lead to RT (re-testing), which loops back to TST.

5. After successful TST (no RT), proceed to PK  LB (optional)  DP  D.

Additionally, LB is sometimes skipped (Case 2).

So breaking it down:

- OR  MS  QS  AS (strict sequence).

- After AS: choice between proceeding to TST or entering a loop that involves IQC and possibly AS.

Wait, but in Case 2, after AS, they go directly to TST without any IQC. So the choice after AS is either TST or enter the IQC loop.

If the IQC loop is entered, then after AS, you do IQC, and then can loop back (doing AS again and IQC) or exit to TST.

Wait, perhaps the structure after AS is:

AS  [X (TST, IQC_LOOP)]

Where IQC_LOOP is a loop that allows multiple IQC executions with AS in between.

But how to model IQC_LOOP. Let's think: IQC_LOOP could be a loop * (IQC, AS), meaning that after IQC, you can choose to do AS (and loop back) or exit.

So the flow would be:

AS  choose TST (exit choice) or enter IQC_LOOP.

In IQC_LOOP:

- Execute IQC.

- Choose to exit (proceed to TST) or do AS and loop back to IQCLoop.

In Case 1:

AS  choose IQC_LOOP.

IQC_LOOP:

IQC  choose AS  loop back.

IQC  choose exit  proceed to TST.

But in Case 1's log, after AS, there's IQC, then AS, then TST. So that would be:

IQC_LOOP executed once: IQC  AS  loop back to IQC_LOOP again?

No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the IQC_LOOP is * (IQC, AS), and the execution is:

IQC (A)  choose B (AS)  loop back to A (IQC).

Then, in the next iteration, IQC  choose exit.

So the sequence would be IQC  AS  IQC  exit  TST.

But in Case 1, the sequence is IQC  AS  TST. So that would require only one iteration of the loop where after A (IQC), B (AS) is chosen, and then exit.

Wait, but according to the loop definition * (A, B), executing A, then choosing B loops back to A. So if you choose B, you have to do A again. So in Case 1, after AS (B), you would loop back to A (IQC), but in the log, after AS, they go to TST. So this suggests that the loop is not correctly modeled this way.

Alternative approach: perhaps after AS, there's a loop that consists of IQC followed by an optional AS. So the loop is * (IQC, AS_XOR_skip), where AS_XOR_skip is a choice between AS and a silent transition.

In this case, the loop would start with IQC, then after IQC, you can choose to do AS (and loop back) or skip (exit).

So in Case 1:

AS  enter loop.

IQC  choose AS  loop back.

IQC  choose skip  exit.

Then proceed to TST.

But the log shows AS  IQC  AS  TST. So that would require two iterations of the loop:

First iteration: IQC  AS  loop back.

Second iteration: IQC  skip  exit.

But that would result in IQC  AS  IQC  TST, which doesn't match the log.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the logging has a mistake, or perhaps the loop is structured differently. Let's look at another case. Case 3 has after AS:

IQC, IQC, AS, IQC, AS, then TST.

So IQC appears twice before AS, then IQC again after AS. This suggests that the loop allows multiple IQCs without AS in between, which doesn't fit the previous models.

Alternatively, perhaps the loop is around IQC, allowing it to repeat any number of times before proceeding to AS and then TST. But how to model that.

Wait, maybe after AS, there's a loop that allows IQC to be repeated any number of times (including zero), followed by AS, and then TST.

So the structure after AS could be:

AS  [X (TST, SEQ(IQC-loop, AS))]

Where IQC-loop is a loop that repeats IQC.

But POWL's loop operator is between two sub-models. So perhaps the IQC-loop is * (IQC, silent), where after IQC, you can choose to exit or do a silent transition and loop back.

So the loop * (IQC, skip) would allow any number of IQCs (including zero) before exiting.

Then, after the loop, AS is executed, then TST.

In this case, the structure after AS would be:

AS  X (TST, SEQ( * (IQC, skip), AS) )

So in Case 1:

AS  choose the right branch (SEQ(loop, AS)).

Loop executes IQC once  choose exit.

Then AS  TST.

Which matches the log: AS  IQC  AS  TST.

In Case 3:

AS  choose the right branch.

Loop executes IQC twice  exit.

Then AS  TST.

But in Case 3's log, after AS, there are two IQCs, then AS, then IQC, then AS, then TST. So this structure doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the loop is different. Maybe after AS, the loop is * (IQC, AS), and the TST comes after the loop.

So the structure would be:

AS  * (IQC, AS)  TST.

In this case, the loop * (IQC, AS) means:

Execute IQC, then choose to exit or do AS and loop back to IQC.

So in Case 1:

AS  loop.

IQC  choose AS  loop back to IQC.

IQC  choose exit  TST.

So sequence: AS  IQC  AS  IQC  TST. But the log shows AS  IQC  AS  TST. So this doesn't match.

Case 3's log after AS is: IQC, IQC, AS, IQC, AS, TST.

If the loop is * (IQC, AS), then:

First iteration: IQC  choose AS  loop back.

Second iteration: IQC  choose AS  loop back.

Third iteration: IQC  exit.

But that would give IQC  AS  IQC  AS  IQC  TST, which doesn't match the log's sequence.

This suggests that the loop structure might not be * (IQC, AS), but something else. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different control structure here.

Let's consider that after AS, there's a loop that allows IQC to be done any number of times, followed by AS, and then TST.

So the loop for IQC is * (IQC, skip), allowing multiple IQCs, then AS, then TST.

So the structure after AS would be:

AS  [X (TST, SEQ( * (IQC, skip), AS) )]

In this case:

- If you choose TST, then proceed directly.

- If you choose the SEQ path: do * (IQC, skip) (any number of IQCs), then AS, then TST.

In Case 1:

AS  choose SEQ path.

Loop does one IQC  exit.

AS  TST.

Which matches.

In Case 3:

AS  choose SEQ path.

Loop does two IQCs  exit.

AS  TST.

But in the log, after AS, there are two IQCs, then AS, then IQC, then AS, then TST. This doesn't fit. So something's wrong.

Alternatively, maybe after the loop of IQCs, there's an AS, and then possibly another loop or choice.

Alternatively, perhaps after AS, the structure is:

AS  X (TST, LOOP_IQC_AS)

Where LOOP_IQC_AS is a loop that can repeat IQC and AS in some pattern.

But without a clear pattern from the logs, it's challenging.

Another angle: look at all cases and see the possible paths after AS.

Case 1: AS  IQC  AS  TST.

Case 2: AS  TST.

Case 3: AS  IQC  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST.

Case 4: AS  TST (no IQC).

Case 5: AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST.

So the paths after AS can be:

1. Direct to TST.

2. IQC  AS  TST.

3. IQC  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST.

Wait, Case 3's path after AS is IQC, IQC, AS, IQC, AS, TST. So that's IQC repeated twice, then AS, then IQC, then AS.

This suggests that after AS, there's a loop where IQC can be done multiple times, followed by AS, and this can repeat.

So perhaps the structure after AS is:

AS  X (TST, LOOP)

Where LOOP is a sequence of (IQC*) followed by AS, and this can repeat.

But how to model this with POWL operators.

Alternatively, perhaps after AS, there's a loop * (SEQ(IQC*, AS), skip), where IQC* represents any number of IQCs.

But POWL's loop operator requires two sub-models. So maybe:

LOOP = * (A, B)

Where A is SEQ(IQC*, AS) and B is skip.

But then, executing A would require doing IQC any number of times followed by AS, then choosing to exit (B) or repeat A.

But this seems complex.

Alternatively, model the IQC repetitions as a loop * (IQC, skip), allowing any number of IQCs, followed by AS.

So after AS:

AS  X (TST, SEQ( * (IQC, skip), AS) )

In this case:

- Choosing TST leads directly to TST.

- Choosing the SEQ path: do any number of IQCs (including zero), then AS, then TST.

In Case 1: SEQ path with one IQC  AS  TST.

In Case 3: SEQ path with two IQCs  AS  then what? The log shows after AS, another IQC and AS. So this approach doesn't account for that.

Alternatively, after AS, the structure could be:

AS  * (X (TST, IQC), AS)

But this is not a valid POWL structure since the loop operator requires two sub-models.

Alternatively, think of the entire after-AS part as a loop that can repeat a sequence of IQCs followed by AS.

But I'm not sure how to model this with POWL's operators.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to model the after-AS part as follows:

After AS, there's a choice between proceeding to TST or entering a loop that involves IQC and AS.

The loop could be modeled as * (IQC, AS), where after IQC, you can choose to do AS (loop back) or exit.

So the structure after AS is:

AS  X (TST, * (IQC, AS))

In this case:

- Choosing TST leads to TST.

- Entering the loop: IQC  choose AS (loop back) or exit.

So in Case 1:

AS  loop.

IQC  AS (loop back).

IQC  exit.

TST.

But the log shows AS  IQC  AS  TST. So this would require:

Loop iteration 1: IQC  AS  loop back.

Loop iteration 2: IQC  exit.

So sequence: AS  IQC  AS  IQC  TST. Which doesn't match.

Hmm. This isn't working. Maybe I need to reconsider.

Looking back at the logs, after AS, the sequence can be:

- AS  TST (Case 2, 4).

- AS  IQC  AS  TST (Case 1,5).

- AS  IQC  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST (Case 3).

So the pattern after AS is zero or more occurrences of (IQC+ followed by AS), ending with TST.

So the general structure is:

AS  (IQC+ AS)*  TST.

This can be modeled with a loop that repeats (IQC+ AS) any number of times.

But how to model this in POWL.

The (IQC+ AS) part can be a sequence: SEQ(IQC+, AS).

The * loop would repeat this sequence.

So the loop would be * (SEQ(IQC+, AS), skip).

But POWL's loop operator is between two sub-models. So * (A, B) means execute A, then choose to exit or do B and repeat A.

Wait, no. The loop operator * (A, B) means:

Execute A.

Then, either exit or execute B and repeat A.

So if A is SEQ(IQC+, AS), and B is skip, then:

- Execute A (IQC+ AS).

- Choose to exit or do B (skip) and repeat A.

But this would mean that after doing A, you can choose to exit or do nothing (skip) and repeat A.

So the loop would allow any number of A's (including zero, if you exit immediately).

But in our case, we need to repeat A (IQC+ AS) any number of times.

So the loop * (A, B) where B is skip would allow:

Option 1: exit immediately (zero iterations).

Option 2: do A, then exit.

Option 3: do A, skip, do A, exit.

Etc.

But in our case, after AS, we need to do (IQC+ AS)* followed by TST.

So the structure after AS would be:

AS  * (SEQ(IQC+, AS), skip)  TST.

But POWL doesn't have a way to represent IQC+ directly. IQC+ means one or more IQC's. So we need to model that as a loop.

So IQC+ can be modeled as * (IQC, skip), allowing one or more IQCs.

So SEQ(IQC+, AS) is SEQ( * (IQC, skip), AS ).

Putting it all together, after AS:

AS  * (SEQ( * (IQC, skip), AS ), skip )  TST.

This seems complicated, but let's break it down.

The outer loop * (A, B) where A is SEQ(loop_IQC, AS) and B is skip.

Each iteration of the outer loop:

1. Execute A: first do loop_IQC (any number of IQCs, including one or more), then AS.

2. Choose to exit or do B (skip) and repeat A.

So the outer loop can repeat A any number of times.

Then, after any number of A's, proceed to TST.

In Case 1:

AS  outer loop:

- Do A once: loop_IQC (one IQC)  AS.

- Exit outer loop.

Proceed to TST.

Sequence: AS  IQC  AS  TST.

Which matches.

In Case 3:

AS  outer loop:

- Do A twice:

  First A: loop_IQC (two IQCs)  AS.

  Second A: loop_IQC (one IQC)  AS.

- Exit.

Proceed to TST.

Sequence: AS  IQC  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST.

Which matches Case 3's log.

In Case 2:

AS  outer loop: exit immediately  TST.

So this structure seems to fit.

So the after-AS part is modeled as:

outer_loop = * (SEQ(inner_loop, AS), skip)

where inner_loop = * (IQC, skip)

So putting this into POWL terms:

After AS:

choice_after_AS = X (TST, outer_loop)

outer_loop = * (SEQ(inner_loop, AS), skip)

inner_loop = * (IQC, skip)

This seems to capture the variations.

Now, moving forward.

After TST, there's a possibility of RT (re-testing), which loops back to TST.

In Case 1 and 5, after TST, there's RT, then TST again.

So the TST  RT  TST loop.

This can be modeled as a loop * (TST, RT).

Because after TST, you can choose to exit (proceed to PK) or do RT and loop back to TST.

So the loop after TST is * (TST, RT).

Wait, but according to the loop definition, it's * (A, B), meaning execute A, then choose to exit or do B and repeat A.

So if A is TST and B is RT:

- Execute TST.

- Choose to exit or do RT and repeat TST.

So in Case 1:

TST  choose B (RT)  TST again  choose exit.

So sequence: TST  RT  TST.

Which matches.

In Case 5:

TST  RT  TST  RT  TST.

So three iterations: TST  RT  TST  RT  TST  exit.

So the loop * (TST, RT) allows this.

Thus, after TST, the loop is * (TST, RT).

Then, after exiting the loop, proceed to PK.

Next steps after TST loop:

PK  LB (optional)  DP  D.

LB is sometimes skipped (Case 2).

So after PK, there's a choice between LB and skipping it.

So X (LB, skip)  DP  D.

Putting it all together:

The overall structure is:

OR  MS  QS  AS  X (TST, outer_loop)  * (TST, RT)  PK  X (LB, skip)  DP  D.

Now, let's model each part with POWL.

First, create transitions for each activity:

OR = Transition("OR")
MS = Transition("MS")
QS = Transition("QS")
AS = Transition("AS")
IQC = Transition("IQC")
TST = Transition("TST")
RT = Transition("RT")
PK = Transition("PK")
LB = Transition("LB")
DP = Transition("DP")
D = Transition("D")
skip = SilentTransition()

Now, the inner_loop for IQC repetitions:

inner_loop_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, skip])

The outer_loop after AS:

outer_loop_seq = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[inner_loop_IQC, AS])

outer_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[outer_loop_seq, skip])

The choice after AS:

choice_after_AS = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[TST, outer_loop])

The loop after TST:

loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

The choice after PK for LB:

choice_LB = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

Now, building the partial order.

The main sequence is:

OR  MS  QS  AS  choice_after_AS  loop_TST_RT  PK  choice_LB  DP  D.

But we need to model this with StrictPartialOrder, ensuring the correct order.

However, in POWL, the partial order is used to define concurrency. But in this case, the main flow is sequential with some loops and choices. So we might need to structure this as a sequence of operatorPOWL nodes connected via partial orders.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire model can be built using operatorPOWL (sequence, choice, loop) and partial orders where necessary.

Wait, but the example given in the prompt uses a mix of OperatorPOWL and StrictPartialOrder. For example, the root is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes [loop, xor], and an edge between them.

So perhaps the overall structure is built by combining operatorPOWL nodes with partial orders to define the control flow.

But given the complexity, let's try to model the entire process step by step.

The initial sequence is OR  MS  QS  AS. These are sequential, so they can be modeled as a sequence operator.

seq_initial = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[OR, MS, QS, AS])

Then, after AS, the choice between TST and the outer_loop.

choice_after_AS = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[TST, outer_loop])

But wait, the outer_loop is a loop that can repeat the seq_IQC_AS (inner_loop_IQC followed by AS).

So need to connect AS to choice_after_AS.

But since AS is part of the initial sequence, we need to ensure that after AS, the choice_after_AS is executed.

This suggests that the initial sequence ends at AS, and then choice_after_AS follows.

So the initial sequence is OR  MS  QS  AS, modeled as a sequence operator.

Then, choice_after_AS is a separate node that follows AS.

But how to connect them in POWL. Since POWL allows partial orders, we can create a StrictPartialOrder that includes these nodes with the appropriate edges.

So the root node could be a StrictPartialOrder containing all the main nodes, with edges defining the sequence.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, use a sequence of operatorPOWL nodes connected via partial orders.

Alternatively, the entire process can be modeled as a sequence of operatorPOWL nodes connected in sequence, with partial orders where concurrency is allowed.

But given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to structure the model using operatorPOWL for sequences, choices, and loops, and use partial orders only where there's concurrency.

Let's proceed step by step.

1. OR  MS  QS  AS: sequence.

seq_initial = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[OR, MS, QS, AS])

2. After AS: choice between TST and outer_loop.

But AS is the last element of seq_initial. So the choice_after_AS must follow seq_initial.

This can be modeled by placing seq_initial and choice_after_AS in a partial order with seq_initial  choice_after_AS.

But since seq_initial is a sequence operator, its completion triggers the next step.

So the partial order would have seq_initial's last node (AS)  choice_after_AS.

But in POWL, when using OperatorPOWL nodes, the control flow is managed internally. So perhaps seq_initial is a sequence that ends with AS, and then choice_after_AS follows.

But to model this, we can create a partial order where seq_initial is a node, and choice_after_AS is another node, with an edge from seq_initial to choice_after_AS.

But OperatorPOWL nodes can be part of a StrictPartialOrder.

So the root could be a StrictPartialOrder with nodes [seq_initial, choice_after_AS, loop_TST_RT, ...] and edges defining the sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is built by combining multiple operatorPOWL nodes with partial orders.

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline the entire structure.

The overall structure is:

OR  MS  QS  AS  (TST or outer_loop)  (TST loop with RT)  PK  (LB or skip)  DP  D.

So breaking into operatorPOWL nodes and partial orders:

1. seq_initial = OperatorPOWL(SEQUENCE, [OR, MS, QS, AS])

2. choice_after_AS = OperatorPOWL(XOR, [TST, outer_loop])

   - outer_loop = OperatorPOWL(LOOP, [outer_loop_seq, skip])

     - outer_loop_seq = OperatorPOWL(SEQUENCE, [inner_loop_IQC, AS])

       - inner_loop_IQC = OperatorPOWL(LOOP, [IQC, skip])

3. loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(LOOP, [TST, RT])

4. choice_LB = OperatorPOWL(XOR, [LB, skip])

Now, the control flow is:

seq_initial  choice_after_AS  loop_TST_RT  PK  choice_LB  DP  D.

But how to model this in POWL.

Assuming that each operatorPOWL node must be connected via partial orders.

So the root would be a StrictPartialOrder containing all these nodes, with edges defining the sequence.

For example:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[seq_initial, choice_after_AS, loop_TST_RT, PK, choice_LB, DP, D])

root.order.add_edge(seq_initial, choice_after_AS)

root.order.add_edge(choice_after_AS, loop_TST_RT)

root.order.add_edge(loop_TST_RT, PK)

root.order.add_edge(PK, choice_LB)

root.order.add_edge(choice_LB, DP)

root.order.add_edge(DP, D)

But this assumes that each operatorPOWL node is a single node in the partial order, which may not be the case. OperatorPOWL nodes can have their own structure, and when placed in a partial order, their internal structure is managed, but the partial order connects them at the top level.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire model is built using operatorPOWL nodes connected in sequence.

But given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to model each major component as an operatorPOWL node and connect them with partial orders.

However, the example provided in the prompt uses a mix of OperatorPOWL and StrictPartialOrder, with the root being a StrictPartialOrder containing OperatorPOWL nodes and setting edges between them.

So following that example, the root would be a StrictPartialOrder that includes all the main nodes (seq_initial, choice_after_AS, loop_TST_RT, etc.), and edges define the control flow.

But this requires that all these nodes are part of the same StrictPartialOrder, which may not be feasible due to the nested nature of the operators.

Alternatively, perhaps each complex part is an OperatorPOWL node, and they are connected via partial orders.

Given the time, perhaps it's better to proceed with constructing the model step by step, even if some details are omitted.

Putting it all together:

- The initial sequence: OR  MS  QS  AS. Modeled as a Sequence operatorPOWL.

- After AS: choice between TST and the outer loop. Modeled as an XOR operatorPOWL.

- The outer loop consists of IQC repeated any number of times, followed by AS, and this can repeat. Modeled as a LOOP operatorPOWL with a Sequence (inner_loop_IQC and AS) and a silent transition.

- After the choice, if the outer loop is chosen, it's executed, then TST loop.

- The TST loop is a LOOP between TST and RT.

- Then PK, choice for LB, DP, D.

Now, translating this into code-like structure (without actual code, but describing the model):

Define all transitions.

Then:

seq_initial = OperatorPOWL(SEQUENCE, [OR, MS, QS, AS])

inner_IQC_loop = OperatorPOWL(LOOP, [IQC, skip])

outer_seq = OperatorPOWL(SEQUENCE, [inner_IQC_loop, AS])

outer_loop = OperatorPOWL(LOOP, [outer_seq, skip])

choice_after_AS = OperatorPOWL(XOR, [TST, outer_loop])

tst_loop = OperatorPOWL(LOOP, [TST, RT])

lb_choice = OperatorPOWL(XOR, [LB, skip])

Now, the overall structure is a partial order where:

seq_initial  choice_after_AS  tst_loop  PK  lb_choice  DP  D.

Additionally, if the outer_loop is chosen, it must complete before tst_loop.

But how to model this in POWL. Since choice_after_AS is an XOR, once a branch is chosen, the other is not executed.

If the outer_loop branch is chosen, then after completing the outer_loop (which may involve multiple iterations), it proceeds to tst_loop.

So the partial order would have:

seq_initial  choice_after_AS

choice_after_AS  tst_loop (regardless of which branch is taken, since XOR ensures only one branch is executed)

tst_loop  PK

PK  lb_choice

lb_choice  DP

DP  D

But also, within the outer_loop, the structure is a loop that can repeat seq_IQC_AS (inner_IQC_loop followed by AS).

Now, considering concurrency: are there any activities that can run in parallel? Looking at the logs, all activities seem to be sequential. So the partial order mainly enforces the sequence, with no concurrency except possibly within the loops or choices.

Thus, the final POWL model would consist of:

- A StrictPartialOrder root node containing all the major nodes (seq_initial, choice_after_AS, tst_loop, PK, lb_choice, DP, D) with edges defining the sequence.

But since OperatorPOWL nodes can't be directly part of a StrictPartialOrder's nodes (as per the example, which uses OperatorPOWL nodes as separate entities connected via partial orders), perhaps each major component is an OperatorPOWL node, and they are connected via a partial order.

However, given the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to model each part as follows:

The entire model is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes representing each major step, connected in sequence.

But this may not capture the loop and choice structures correctly.

Alternatively, the model is built using a combination of OperatorPOWL nodes for the complex parts (loops, choices) and connecting them with partial orders for the overall sequence.

Given the time, I'll proceed to describe the model structure in terms of the required POWL elements.

Final Model Structure:

1. Initial Sequence (OR  MS  QS  AS)
   - OperatorPOWL with Operator.SEQUENCE containing OR, MS, QS, AS.

2. Choice After AS:
   - OperatorPOWL with Operator.XOR containing two branches:
     a. Direct to TST.
     b. Outer Loop (described below).

3. Outer Loop (after AS choice):
   - OperatorPOWL with Operator.LOOP containing:
     a. A Sequence (Operator.SEQUENCE) of:
        i. Inner Loop for IQC repetitions (Operator.LOOP with IQC and skip).
        ii. AS.
     b. SilentTransition (skip) for exiting the loop.

4. TST Loop:
   - OperatorPOWL with Operator.LOOP containing TST and RT.

5. Packaging and Labeling:
   - PK.
   - Choice (Operator.XOR) between LB and skip.

6. Final Sequence (DP  D).

The overall control flow is managed by a StrictPartialOrder that sequences these components:

- Initial Sequence  Choice After AS  TST Loop  PK  Labeling Choice  DP  D.

Additionally, within the Choice After AS, selecting the Outer Loop branch would execute the Outer Loop before proceeding to the TST Loop.

Thus, the final POWL model would involve:

- Creating each OperatorPOWL node for the complex structures (loops, choices).
- Using a StrictPartialOrder to define the overall sequence and any concurrency (though in this case, it's mostly sequential).

Now, translating this into the required format (describing the model without code):

The model consists of:

- A StrictPartialOrder root with nodes:
  1. seq_initial (SEQUENCE of OR, MS, QS, AS)
  2. choice_after_AS (XOR of TST and outer_loop)
  3. outer_loop (LOOP of (SEQUENCE of inner_IQC_loop and AS) and skip)
  4. inner_IQC_loop (LOOP of IQC and skip)
  5. tst_loop (LOOP of TST and RT)
  6. PK
  7. lb_choice (XOR of LB and skip)
  8. DP
  9. D

Edges in the partial order:
- seq_initial  choice_after_AS
- choice_after_AS  tst_loop (regardless of branch chosen)
- tst_loop  PK
- PK  lb_choice
- lb_choice  DP
- DP  D

Within the outer_loop:
- The inner_IQC_loop allows any number of IQCs (including one or more).
- The outer_loop allows repeating the sequence of IQC repetitions followed by AS.

This structure captures the observed behavior in the event logs, including the optional IQC loops, the re-testing loop, and the optional labeling step.
