Proposed Process-Tree (root operator = SEQUENCE)

->(
    'RA',                                   // Receive Application
    'VF',                                   // first Validate Form
    'AE',                                   // Assess Eligibility
    * (                                      // loop for missing information
        ,                                  // do nothing  possibility to leave the loop immediately
        ->( 'RMI', 'VF' )                   // otherwise: Request Missing Info, then (re-)Validate Form
      ),
    'AD',                                   // Approval Decision
    'SC',                                   // Send Confirmation
    'AC'                                    // Archive Case
)

How to read the model
1. The normal flow is a left-to-right sequence: RA  VF  AE  …  AD  SC  AC.  
2. After Assess Eligibility the loop * (…) may be entered zero, one, or many times.  
   • If the  (“tau” – silent step) is chosen the process leaves the loop immediately.  
   • Otherwise the branch  ->(RMI, VF) is executed (Request Missing Info followed by another Validate Form) and the loop decision is evaluated again, allowing any number of RMI + VF repetitions.  
3. Once the loop is exited, the case proceeds to the final sequence Approval Decision  Send Confirmation  Archive Case.

The tree therefore captures all traces observed in the log:

• Cases without missing information:  
  RA VF AE AD SC AC

• Cases with one cycle of missing information:  
  RA VF AE RMI VF AD SC AC

• Cases with multiple cycles:  
  RA VF AE RMI VF RMI VF … AD SC AC

while remaining minimal and easily interpretable.
