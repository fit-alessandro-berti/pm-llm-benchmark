# Loan Process Conformance Analysis

---

## 1. Normative Rule Violations

###  Case 1 — No Normative Violations
Case 1 follows the prescribed sequence perfectly for an approved loan:

> Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

Every ordering rule is respected, and because the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation correctly precedes Close Case. **No normative violations detected.**

---

###  Case 2 — Multiple Normative Violations

| # | Violation | Evidence |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check** | Risk Assessment at 08:20 preceded Credit Check at 09:00 — directly inverts the mandatory ordering rule |
| 2 | **Finalize Documentation after a Rejected loan** | A rejection decision was made at 09:30, yet Finalize Documentation was performed at 10:00 — explicitly prohibited |
| 3 | **Inform Applicant step was skipped entirely** | The log jumps from Loan Decision (Rejected) directly to Finalize Documentation, with no record of the applicant ever being informed |

**Summary:** Case 2 is the most seriously non-compliant case, containing three distinct normative violations that corrupt the fundamental integrity of the process.

---

###  Case 3 — No Normative Violations
Despite significant delays, the sequence for an approved loan is correctly maintained:

> Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

All ordering rules are respected, and since the loan was approved, documentation was finalized before closure. **No normative violations detected.**

---

## 2. Desiderata (Best Practice) Failures

Violations here are **not severe** but represent **suboptimal behavior** worth noting.

### Case 1 — Minor Desiderata Gap

| Desideratum | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Credit Check within 24 hrs of Application |  Met (30 minutes) |
| Inform Applicant within 48 hrs of Loan Decision |  Met (2 hours) |
| Follow-up Call before Close Case |  **Not performed** |

### Case 2 — Desiderata Assessment
Given the severe normative violations, desiderata compliance is secondary. Notably, no Follow-up Call was conducted, but this is overshadowed by the hard rule breaches.

### Case 3 — Multiple Desiderata Gaps

| Desideratum | Status | Detail |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Credit Check within 24 hrs of Application |  **Missed** | Application: Jan 12 09:00  Credit Check: Jan 14 10:00 (~**49 hours** elapsed) |
| Inform Applicant within 48 hrs of Loan Decision |  **Missed** | Loan Decision: Jan 14 12:00  Inform Applicant: Jan 16 15:00 (~**51 hours** elapsed) |
| Follow-up Call before Close Case |  **Not performed** | Explicitly noted as absent |

Case 3 misses **all three** recommended best practices, making it the weakest performer on desiderata, even though it fully complies with normative rules.

## 3. Interpretations and Justifications

### Case 1
The only gap (no Follow-up Call) could reasonably be explained by the loan being processed and communicated **entirely within a single business day** (09:00–14:00). When a case moves this swiftly and the applicant was already informed in person or via immediate communication, a formal follow-up call may have been deemed unnecessary. This is a very minor deviation.

### Case 2
The violations are harder to justify charitably, but plausible operational explanations might include:

- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** A staff member may have mistakenly begun the risk evaluation using preliminary information (e.g., an internal risk score) before the formal external credit check returned. This is still a process violation regardless of intent.
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** This could reflect a clerical error — for instance, a staff member may have prepared documentation anticipating approval, then failed to cancel that step after the rejection decision. Alternatively, "Finalize Documentation" might have been mislabeled and actually referred to archiving rejection paperwork — though this interpretation is a stretch given the defined terminology.
- **Missing Inform Applicant:** This is the most difficult to justify. It is possible notification happened through an unlogged channel (phone call, walk-in meeting), but from a process-compliance standpoint, the absence of a recorded step is itself a violation.

### Case 3
The delays are the most interpretively forgiving:

- **Late Credit Check (~49 hrs):** The application arrived on a Friday (Jan 12) and the credit check was completed on a Monday (Jan 14). If weekends are not business days, this delay may be entirely explainable by the organization's operational schedule — though ideally the SLA should account for this.
- **Late Applicant Notification (~51 hrs):** Similarly, the loan decision was made on Monday (Jan 14) and the applicant was informed on Wednesday (Jan 16). Processing complexity, high workload, or internal approval chains could explain this minor overrun.
- **No Follow-up Call:** With a two-day gap before notification, the team may have compensated through other communication channels. Alternatively, the follow-up call may simply have been deprioritized due to workload — a suboptimal but not uncommon real-world trade-off.

## Summary Table

| Case | Normative Violations | Desiderata Failures | Overall Assessment |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | None | Follow-up Call missing |  Compliant (minor best-practice gap) |
| 2 | Risk Assessment order, Finalize after Rejection, Inform Applicant skipped | Follow-up Call missing |  Seriously Non-Compliant |
| 3 | None | Late Credit Check, Late Notification, No Follow-up Call |  Compliant but Suboptimal |
