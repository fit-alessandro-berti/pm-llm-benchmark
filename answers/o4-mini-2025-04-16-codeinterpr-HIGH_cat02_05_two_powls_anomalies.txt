Below is a recap of what we would expect in a “textbook” Hire-to-Retire, the anomalies we see in each of your two POWL edits, and why Model 1 is the more normative of the two.

1.Normative Hire-to-Retire (expected sequence)  
   • Post_Job_Ad  
    Screen_Candidates  
    Conduct_Interviews  
    Make_Hiring_Decision  
    Onboard_Employee  
    Add_to_Payroll  
    Close_Case  

2.Model 1 (StrictPartialOrder)  
   Edges:  
     Post  Screen  
     Screen  Interview  
     Screen  Decide  
     Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  
   
   – Missing InterviewDecide: “Make Hiring Decision” is only constrained to wait for Screen_Candidates, not for Conduct_Interviews.  
     • You could make the hiring decision before—or even without—ever doing the interviews.  
   – Interview is not connected to the “rest” after Screen: because there is no path from Interview into Onboard, you could even conduct interviews after Close_Case.  
   
   Severity: a single, easily-fixed ordering omission. All activities are present and in the right relative order except for that one missing arc.

3.Model 2 (StrictPartialOrder + LOOP + XOR + silent skip)  
   Edges:  
     Post  Screen  
     Post  Interview  Decide  [loop_onboarding]  [xor_payroll]  Close  
   Operators:  
     loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)  
     xor_payroll    = XOR(Payroll, skip)  

   Key anomalies:  
   • Screening is only tied to Post_Job_Ad. There is no Screen  Interview or Screen  Decide.  
     – You could conduct interviews (and even hire) before ever screening—or screen after you’ve closed the case.  
   • Payroll is under an XOR with a silent skip: you can legitimately “skip” Add_to_Payroll.  
     – In a real Hire-to-Retire you cannot simply waive payroll.  
   • The LOOP around Onboard_Employee:  
     – Imposes at least one Onboard but then allows an arbitrary number of silent “skip  Onboard” cycles.  
     – Implies you might “onboard” the same hire repeatedly (or get stuck in an infinite loop of silent skips).  
   • Inversion of Interview vs. Screening: Interview only waits on Post_Job_Ad, so interviews can run in parallel with—or before—screening.  

   Severity: multiple fundamental violations of the standard sequence, plus potential for deadloops and skippedpayroll.

4.Conclusion  
   Model 1 has exactly one orderingedge missing (InterviewDecide), all other activities are in the correct linear order.  
   Model 2, by contrast, dismantles the core screeningthen-interview logic, makes payroll optional, and injects a potentially infinite onboarding loop.  

Model 1 is far closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire: it merely needs to add the edge  
      Interview  Make_Hiring_Decision  
   to restore full correctness. Model 2 would require far more surgery to eliminate its multiple, process-breaking anomalies.
