A common use case of decomposition is to divide large datasets into smaller pieces where each sub-dataset can be analyzed independently. Decomposition techniques allow us not only to efficiently mine data using multiple algorithms, but also provide accurate insights that may not have been possible with a single approach.

However, in large-scale process mining projects, decomposing complex processes poses several challenges:

1. Complexity: As the complexity of business processes increases, it becomes harder to identify and separate key components which often require significant expertise and effort on parts of decomposition.
   
2. Data availability vs. quality: Decomposition relies heavily on data quality; if there isn't sufficient available data, the results obtained from process mining might not be accurate even after decomposing. Additionally, a large amount of time may be needed to clean and prepare datasets for decomposition if they aren't already well organized.

3. Algorithm selection: In order to mine the information effectively, it is essential to use adequate algorithms that fit each aspect or sub-component of a process thoroughly. Choosing the right tools and applying effective algorithm selections can substantially streamline and accelerate data analysis.
   
4. Data privacy: Privacy regulations such as GDPR in many countries require organizations to be well aware of their participants' personal data and its usage.

5. Bias and accuracy: Decomposition and machine learning processes are also subject to bias, which means results may not be entirely accurate or unbiased due to the selection process of what is decomposed into separate pieces, leading organizations to adopt caution when applying decomposition strategies in large-scale projects.
