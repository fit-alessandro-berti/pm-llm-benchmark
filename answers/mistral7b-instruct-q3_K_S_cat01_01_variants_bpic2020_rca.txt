The given data provides a list of approvals and rejections for employee expenses. It shows the frequency of each action and its associated performance metric (in terms of payment handled).

However, it does not provide any information about the root causes of the performance issues in the process. To identify the root causes of the performance issues, more context and data would be needed to analyze the specific steps involved in the expense approval process, such as the number of employees submitting expenses, the number of approvers required for each expense, the time taken for each approval step, and any other factors that may impact the performance of the process.

Additionally, it is important to identify any potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the current approval process and evaluate if any changes need to be made to optimize its performance. This may involve automating certain steps, streamlining approval workflows, providing training to employees and approvers, or implementing new technologies to support the expense approval process.
