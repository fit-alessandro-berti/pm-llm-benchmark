To create a process tree that captures the main flow, the optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival, we can use the following structure:

```
+ (
  -> (
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    -> (
      'Validate Form (VF)',
      -> (
        'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
        * (
          'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
          'Validate Form (VF)'
        ),
        'Approval Decision (AD)'
      )
    ),
    'Send Confirmation (SC)',
    'Archive Case (AC)'
  )
)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Parallel Execution (`+`):**
   - The entire process can be seen as a parallel execution of two main branches: the main sequence of activities and the repetition of requesting missing information and re-validation.

2. **Sequence (`->`):**
   - The main sequence of activities is `Receive Application (RA)`, `Validate Form (VF)`, `Assess Eligibility (AE)`, `Approval Decision (AD)`, `Send Confirmation (SC)`, and `Archive Case (AC)`.
   - The sequence is maintained within the `->` operator.

3. **Loop (`*`):**
   - After `Assess Eligibility (AE)`, there is a loop that involves `Request Missing Info (RMI)` and `Validate Form (VF)`. This loop can repeat multiple times until the loop is exited, and then the process continues with `Approval Decision (AD)`.

### Detailed Breakdown:

- **Main Sequence:**
  - `Receive Application (RA)`
  - `Validate Form (VF)`
  - `Assess Eligibility (AE)`
  - Loop starts after `Assess Eligibility (AE)`:
    - `Request Missing Info (RMI)`
    - `Validate Form (VF)`
  - Loop exits and continues with:
    - `Approval Decision (AD)`
    - `Send Confirmation (SC)`
    - `Archive Case (AC)`

This process tree model ensures that the main flow is captured, along with the optional repetitions of requesting missing information and re-validation, and finally the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival steps.
