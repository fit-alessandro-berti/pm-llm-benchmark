Here’s a singleshot DuckDB SQL that:

1. Builds the ordered activitysequence for each case  
2. Groups by sequence to count how many cases share it  
3. Picks the top K sequences by frequency  
4. Returns all original events for cases whose sequence is in that top K  

```sql
-- set your desired K here
-- e.g. PRAGMA my_top_k = 5;
-- or just replace :K below with a literal
WITH
  -- 1) compute the full, timestampordered activity sequence per case
  case_sequences AS (
    SELECT
      case_id,
      LIST_AGG(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
  ),

  -- 2) count how many cases share each distinct sequence
  variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
      activity_sequence,
      COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
  ),

  -- 3) pick the top K sequences by case_count
  top_variants AS (
    SELECT
      activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT :K               -- replace :K with your integer (e.g. 5)
  ),

  -- 4) find all case_ids whose sequence is in the top K
  selected_cases AS (
    SELECT
      cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    JOIN top_variants tv
      ON cs.activity_sequence = tv.activity_sequence
  )

-- 5) return all events for those selected cases
SELECT
  el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN selected_cases sc
  ON el.case_id = sc.case_id
ORDER BY
  el.case_id,
  el.timestamp;
```

Explanation of each step:

• case_sequences  
  – GROUP BY case_id, then LIST_AGG(...) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) to stitch activities into one ordered string per case.  

• variant_counts  
  – GROUP BY that string to count how many cases share the exact same sequence.  

• top_variants  
  – ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT K to pick the K most frequent variants.  

• selected_cases  
  – JOIN back to case_sequences to get all case_ids whose sequence is one of those top K.  

• final SELECT  
  – JOIN the original event_log to selected_cases, so you retrieve every event (all columns) for only those cases in the top K variants.
