### High-Level Summary of the Process

This dataset appears to describe the steps or stages within a financial or administrative system, likely tied to an expense reimbursement or declaration approval process. The process tracks employee interactions through various approval stages from submission to final approval, and also includes potential rejections, re-submissions, and handling of payments. It provides both **frequency** (number of occurrences) and **performance time** (likely in seconds) for each transition between stages or events.

The core process revolves around:

1. **Declaration Submissions**: Employees submit declarations (likely for reimbursements) and these pass through various approval and rejection decision points.
   
2. **Approvals and Rejections**: Various roles (Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, Supervisor) handle approvals and rejections at multiple stages.

3. **Final Approval and Payment**: The process is finalized after the Supervisor provides final approval, after which the request proceeds to payment.

4. **Handling Rejections/Fallback**: Rejected declarations can often be resubmitted or looped back through the process for corrections.

5. **End State**: The process concludes either with the payment being handled or the declaration being rejected by the system due to missing steps/data.

### Detailed Phases of the Process

#### **1. Submission**
- **Phase Start**: The process typically begins with the employee submitting a declaration (action: "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE").
  - High frequencies seen (8202 occurrences of this).
  
#### **2. Pathways for Approvals**
There are multiple paths the submission can follow based on who processes the approval next:

- **Approval Pathways:**
  - **Administration**: They either approve it or reject it (8202 times "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" to "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION").
    - Administration might pass the declaration to others like the Final Approver (SUPERVISOR) or Budget Owner.
  - **Pre-Approver and Budget Owner Path**: Secondary pre-approvals may occur before going to the supervisor for final approval.
  - **Supervisor's Role**: The Supervisor gives the final approval across multiple pathways before the payment request starts.

- Key paths:
  - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**:
    - Can go either to the Supervisor for final approval (5133 occurrences) or to another approver role like the **Budget Owner**.
  - **Budget Owner** might also approve and forward to the Supervisor (2788 times).
  - **Pre-Approver** has a smaller role and also helps further decisions (674 occurrences).

#### **3. Handling Rejections**
Rejections happen at multiple stages, typically requiring the employee to re-submit the declaration:

- Various roles can reject the declaration:
  - **Rejection by EMPLOYEE or Other Role** leads to resubmission ("REJECTED" -> "SUBMITTED"). Common reasons can include administrative or supervisor rejections of budgets or specifics (e.g., Rejected by Supervisor or Pre-approver).
  - **Re-submission** after rejection is common (1081 resubmissions happen after rejection by Employee).

#### **4. Final Approval and Payment**
- Once the declaration passes the approval stage, it moves into payment processing ("Request Payment" -> "Payment Handled").
- If there are issues handling payments (e.g., missing documentation), the declaration might also be rejected afterward (seen in rare instances like one case of payment rejection).

#### **Payment Flow**
- Once final approval happens:
  - **Payment Request** is triggered. We see a highly frequent flow from “Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR” to payment.
  - **Payment is Handled** after the request process, and this completes the workflow if no rejections occur.
  
  At times, payments can hit issues and go into a "missing" state. The performance time for problematic transitions (including the rejected transitions) may be significantly higher, indicating long delays or problematic cases.

### Potential Process Bottlenecks

- **Rejection Loops**: Several points exhibit high performance times (in seconds), indicating delays:
  - *For example*: Submissions rejected by employees or supervisors can take a long time to re-enter the process. "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" to "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" has a performance time of 447425.560 seconds, hinting at a process bottleneck and significant delays.
  
- **Rejected payments**: Handling rejected payments involves delays in handling rejected declarations after reaching certain stages (for example, performance times for "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" to rejection).

---

### Exceptional Cases

- **Low-Frequency Rejections or Submissions**: 
  - There are exceptional cases such as fewer than 10 occurrences where unusual paths like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" or "Payment Handled -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" occur. These might represent deviations or rare cases in the system.

---

### Observations

1. **Frequency vs. Performance**: 
   - High-frequency transitions like request payment processes appear relatively fast (e.g., "Request Payment"  "Payment Handled”).
   - Conversely, rejections seem to face significantly higher performance delays.
   
2. **Rejection Loops**: Several roles (SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, and BUDGET OWNER) reject submissions, forcing the employee to rework declarations and resubmit. This contributes to delays and inefficiency.

3. **Key Role of the Supervisor**: The **Supervisor** seems to be the critical endpoint for approval before any payments are made. Their decisions are final, and payment requests generally follow their approvals.

### Conclusion

This process can be summarized as a declaration workflow wherein employees submit reimbursement or other financial declarations, and various roles (administration, pre-approver, budget owner, supervisor) handle reviews, approvals, and rejections. The final approval is crucial for the release of payments. However, the high performance times at rejection steps indicate inefficiencies, especially in terms of handling rejections and re-initiating the process, possibly indicating areas for process optimization.
