The pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, which can be either standard or custom. Here's a detailed explanation of the process, including the purpose of each step, the meaning of the gateways, and how the different paths converge or loop back.

### Start Event
- **Start Event:** The process begins when a customer request is received.

### Task A: "Receive Customer Request"
- **Purpose:** This task involves receiving and logging the customer's request.

### Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type
- **Purpose:** This gateway checks the type of request (Standard or Custom) and directs the flow accordingly.
- **Meaning:** XOR (Exclusive OR) means only one path will be taken based on the condition.

#### If Type = Standard
- **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
  - **Purpose:** Validate the standard request to ensure it meets predefined criteria.

- **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
  - **Purpose:** This gateway allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously.
  - **Meaning:** AND means all parallel paths must be completed before moving forward.

  - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
    - **Purpose:** Verify the customer's creditworthiness.

  - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
    - **Purpose:** Check if the requested items are available in inventory.

- **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
  - **Purpose:** This join ensures that both the credit check and inventory check are completed before proceeding.

- **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
  - **Purpose:** Determine the delivery date based on the validated request and inventory availability.

#### If Type = Custom
- **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
  - **Purpose:** Assess whether the custom request is feasible.

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
  - **Purpose:** This gateway checks if the custom request is feasible.
  - **Meaning:** XOR means only one path will be taken based on the condition.

  - **If Yes**
    - **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
      - **Purpose:** Create a quotation for the custom request.

  - **If No**
    - **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
      - **Purpose:** Inform the customer that the custom request is not feasible.
      - **End Event:** The process ends here for this path.

### After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed
- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
  - **Purpose:** This gateway checks if managerial approval is required.
  - **Meaning:** XOR means only one path will be taken based on the condition.

  - **If Yes**
    - **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
      - **Purpose:** Seek approval from a manager.

    - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
      - **Purpose:** This gateway checks if the approval was granted.
      - **Meaning:** XOR means only one path will be taken based on the condition.

      - **If Yes**
        - **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
          - **Purpose:** Create the final invoice for the customer.

      - **If No**
        - **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
          - **Purpose:** Reassess the conditions that led to the rejection of approval.

        - **Loop back to Task E1 (for Custom Path) or Task D (for Standard Path)**
          - **Purpose:** Re-evaluate the custom quotation or recalculate the delivery date based on new conditions.

  - **If No Approval Needed**
    - **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
      - **Purpose:** Create the final invoice for the customer.

### Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"
- **Purpose:** Notify the customer that their request has been processed and provide them with the final details.

### End Event
- **End Event:** The process concludes after sending the confirmation to the customer.

### Summary of Differences Based on Request Type
- **Standard Request:**
  - Involves standard validation, parallel checks (credit and inventory), and calculation of the delivery date.
  - Approval may be needed before generating the final invoice.

- **Custom Request:**
  - Involves feasibility analysis and, if feasible, preparation of a custom quotation.
  - If not feasible, a rejection notice is sent.
  - Approval may be needed before generating the final invoice, and if not approved, conditions are re-evaluated, potentially looping back to the quotation or delivery date calculation.

### Conditions for Approvals or Rework Steps
- **Approval Needed:** If the request requires managerial approval, the process includes obtaining approval and checking if it is granted.
- **Re-evaluation:** If approval is not granted, the process loops back to re-evaluate the conditions, either for the custom quotation or the delivery date calculation.

This detailed explanation covers the purpose of each step, the meaning of the gateways, and how the different paths converge or loop back in the business process.
