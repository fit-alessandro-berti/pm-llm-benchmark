### **Answer to Your Task**

---

## **1. Cases Violating the Normative Rules (Strict Rules)**

### **Case 2:**
- **Violation 1:** **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check**  
  - **Reason:** According to the normative constraint, **Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment**.  
  - **Timestamps:**  
    - 2024-01-11 08:20 – **Risk Assessment** (before Credit Check)  
    - 2024-01-11 08:20 – **Credit Check** (after Risk Assessment)  
  - **Impact:** This violates the **sequence rule** and is a **serious violation** of the process.

- **Violation 2:** **Finalize Documentation after Loan Decision (Rejected)**  
  - **Reason:** According to the normative constraint, **Finalize Documentation must not occur after a rejection**.  
  - **Timestamps:**  
    - 2024-01-11 09:30 – **Loan Decision (Rejected)**  
    - 2024-01-11 10:00 – **Finalize Documentation**  
  - **Impact:** This is a **serious violation** of the process logic.

### **Summary of Normative Rule Violations:**

| Case ID | Violation Description | Type of Violation |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 2       | Risk Assessment before Credit Check | **Serious (Sequence Rule)** |
| 2       | Finalize Documentation after Rejection | **Serious (Decision Logic)** |

---

## **2. Cases Failing to Meet the Desiderata Conditions (Recommended Practices)**

### **Case 3:**
- **Violation 1:** **Credit Check performed more than 24 hours after Application Received**  
  - **Reason:** The desideratum recommends **Credit Check within 24 hours** of the application.  
  - **Timestamps:**  
    - Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00  
    - Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00 (2 days later)  
  - **Impact:** **Suboptimal behavior**, but **not a serious violation**.

- **Violation 2:** **Inform Applicant more than 48 hours after Loan Decision**  
  - **Reason:** The desideratum recommends **Inform Applicant within 48 hours** of the decision.  
  - **Timestamps:**  
    - Loan Decision (Approved): 2024-01-14 12:00  
    - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00 (48 hours and 3 hours later)  
  - **Impact:** **Suboptimal behavior**, but **not a serious violation**.

- **Violation 3:** **No Follow-up Call before Closing the Case**  
  - **Reason:** While not a strict rule, the desideratum encourages a **Follow-up Call** before closing.  
  - **Impact:** **Suboptimal behavior**, but **not a serious violation**.

### **Summary of Desiderata Violations:**

| Case ID | Violation Description | Type of Violation |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 3       | Credit Check more than 24 hours after application | **Desideratum (Recommended Practice)** |
| 3       | Inform Applicant more than 48 hours after decision | **Desideratum (Recommended Practice)** |
| 3       | No Follow-up Call before closing | **Desideratum (Recommended Practice)** |

## **3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors**

### **Case 2:**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**  
  This appears to be a **process error** or **misconfiguration** in the system. It may be due to a **manual error** or **incorrect automation logic**.  
  **Possible justification:** If the system allows for reordering of tasks, it may be a design flaw rather than a deliberate deviation.

- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**  
  This is likely a **process error** or **incorrect logic in the system**. It may be due to a **lack of validation** at the time of documentation finalization.  
  **Possible justification:** It could be a **human error** or a **bug in the workflow engine**.

---

### **Case 3:**
- **Credit Check after 24 hours:**  
  This may be due to **resource constraints** (e.g., delayed availability of credit check personnel), **external dependencies** (e.g., waiting for third-party data), or **processing delays**.  
  **Possible justification:** While not ideal, it’s a **common real-world scenario** where timing constraints are not always met.

- **Inform Applicant after 48 hours:**  
  This may be due to **internal delays** in communication, **complex decision-making**, or **external factors** (e.g., holiday periods, system downtime).  
  **Possible justification:** The process may have been **interrupted**, or the team may have **prioritized other tasks**.

- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  This may be due to **staffing issues**, **oversight**, or **lack of training**.  
  **Possible justification:** It may be an **optional step** that was **not prioritized**, especially if the case was handled quickly or there were no complications.

## **Final Summary**

| Case ID | Normative Violations | Desiderata Violations | Comments |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|----------|
| 1       | None                 | None                   | Fully compliant with both rules and best practices |
| 2       |  (2 violations)     | None                   | Significant process errors; likely due to system or human error |
| 3       | None                 |  (3 violations)       | Suboptimal but not serious; possible resource or timing constraints |
