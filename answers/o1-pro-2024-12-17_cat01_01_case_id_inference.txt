**Detailed Reasoning**

1. We begin by identifying the starting points of each case. Typically, a hospital case (patient journey) starts with a "Register patient" activity. In the given event list, we see three distinct "Register patient" events:
   - Event #1: "Register patient" in ER for a 45-year-old male.
   - Event #2: "Register patient" in ER for a 62-year-old female.
   - Event #3: "Register patient" in Surgery for a 28-year-old male.

   These three "Register patient" events likely correspond to three distinct patient cases.

2. Next, we group subsequent activities based on matching patient attributes (age, gender) and logical sequence. Hospitals typically follow a single patient's journey through various steps until discharge. Also, the department and resource changes provide context but are less reliable for identification compared to demographic consistency.

3. **Case A (Patient: 45-year-old Male, started in ER):**  
   - **Event #1 (2024-03-15T08:05:13Z):** Register patient (ER, 45 M)  
     The patient is first registered in the ER.
   - **Event #4 (08:10:50Z):** Initial triage (ER, 45 M)  
     After registration, an ER patient is typically triaged, so this follows logically.
   - **Event #7 (08:15:42Z):** X-ray imaging (Radiology, 45 M)  
     After triage, a common next step for injuries is imaging. The age/gender match, plus the logical progression (ER → Radiology for imaging), fits.
   - **Event #12 (08:23:10Z):** Doctor consultation (ER, 45 M, Dr. Lee) with diagnosis=hairline_fracture  
     After imaging results, the patient returns for a consultation. Same patient demographics and department (ER) confirm continuity.
   - **Event #15 (08:30:05Z):** Patient discharged (ER, 45 M)  
     The final step is discharge from ER. The timeline makes sense (less than an hour after registration), and the same patient attributes are consistent.

   Thus, events #1, #4, #7, #12, and #15 form one complete case.

4. **Case B (Patient: 62-year-old Female, started in ER):**  
   - **Event #2 (08:07:02Z):** Register patient (ER, 62 F)  
     Another patient registered in the ER.
   - **Event #5 (08:12:29Z):** Initial triage (ER, 62 F)  
     After registration, triage follows logically.
   - **Event #8 (08:16:10Z):** Lab test requested (ER, 62 F)  
     The ER doctor requests lab tests for the same patient.
   - **Event #10 (08:20:27Z):** Lab test completed (Laboratory, 62 F)  
     Lab test results come back for the same patient.
   - **Event #11 (08:22:54Z):** Doctor consultation (ER, 62 F) with diagnosis=minor_infection  
     After test results, the doctor consults again in the ER.
   - **Event #14 (08:27:00Z):** Prescription created (ER, 62 F)  
     Medication is prescribed for the patient.
   - **Event #17 (08:35:29Z):** Patient discharged (ER, 62 F)  
     Finally, the patient is discharged. The entire flow is coherent with an ER visit involving tests and medication.

   Thus, events #2, #5, #8, #10, #11, #14, and #17 form another distinct case.

5. **Case C (Patient: 28-year-old Male, started in Surgery):**  
   - **Event #3 (08:07:15Z):** Register patient (Surgery, 28 M)  
     This patient’s journey starts in the Surgery department, perhaps for a scheduled procedure.
   - **Event #6 (08:13:00Z):** Doctor consultation (Surgery, 28 M) reason=scheduled_knee_surgery  
     A surgical consultation follows registration.
   - **Event #9 (08:16:45Z):** Surgery preparation (Surgery, 28 M)  
     Preparation for surgery naturally follows consultation.
   - **Event #13 (08:25:19Z):** Surgery performed (Surgery, 28 M)  
     The surgery is conducted, which aligns with the reason provided earlier.
   - **Event #16 (08:31:37Z):** Recovery room (Surgery, 28 M)  
     Post-surgery, the patient moves to the recovery room.
   - **Event #18 (08:40:13Z):** Patient discharged (Surgery, 28 M)  
     Eventually, the patient is discharged once stable.

   Thus, events #3, #6, #9, #13, #16, and #18 form the third complete case.

**Summary of Cases**

- **Case A (ER, 45 M):** Events #1 → #4 → #7 → #12 → #15  
- **Case B (ER, 62 F):** Events #2 → #5 → #8 → #10 → #11 → #14 → #17  
- **Case C (Surgery, 28 M):** Events #3 → #6 → #9 → #13 → #16 → #18

Each of these sequences represents a logically consistent patient journey with appropriate chronological order, matching demographic attributes, and typical clinical workflow steps from registration to discharge.
