Looking at the event log, I can identify the following patterns:

**Case 1 trace:** RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC
**Case 2 trace:** RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC  
**Case 3 trace:** RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

From this analysis, I can see:
1. All cases start with: RA  VF  AE (mandatory sequence)
2. There's an optional loop for requesting missing info and re-validation
3. All cases end with: AD  SC  AC (mandatory sequence)

The process tree that captures this behavior is:

```
-> (
    -> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE' ),
    * (
        tau,
        -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' )
    ),
    -> ( 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )
)
```

This structure represents:
- **Initial sequence**: Receive Application  Validate Form  Assess Eligibility
- **Optional loop**: Either exit (tau) or execute Request Missing Info  Validate Form (can repeat multiple times)
- **Final sequence**: Approval Decision  Send Confirmation  Archive Case

The loop operator `*` allows for zero or more iterations of the RMIVF subsequence, which explains:
- Case 2: No loop iterations (direct tau exit)
- Case 1: One loop iteration (RMI  VF)
- Case 3: Two loop iterations (RMI  VF, then RMI  VF again)

This model balances fitness (covers all observed traces), precision (doesn't allow invalid behaviors), and simplicity (minimal structure that captures the essential process logic).
