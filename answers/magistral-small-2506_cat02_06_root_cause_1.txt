### Analysis of the Event Log

#### 1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times
First, let's calculate the total resolution time for each case (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket"):

- **Case 101**:
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:00
  - Close: 2024-03-01 10:15
  - Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes

- **Case 102**:
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:05
  - Close: 2024-03-02 09:15
  - Duration: 25 hours 10 minutes

- **Case 103**:
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:10
  - Close: 2024-03-01 09:30
  - Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes

- **Case 104**:
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:20
  - Close: 2024-03-02 08:30
  - Duration: 24 hours 10 minutes

- **Case 105**:
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:25
  - Close: 2024-03-03 09:30
  - Duration: 2 days 1 hour 5 minutes (50 hours 5 minutes)

From this, we observe:
- The average resolution time is around 13 hours 55 minutes (excluding outlier cases 102 and 105).
- Cases **102** (25 hours 10 minutes) and **105** (50 hours 5 minutes) are significantly longer than others.

#### 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues
Let's analyze the long-running cases (102 and 105):

**Case 102**:
- **Escalation**: The ticket was escalated to a Level-2 Agent at 11:30 on 2024-03-01, and the investigation by Level-2 started at 14:00 (2.5 hours later). This delay between escalation and investigation is a potential bottleneck.
- **Total waiting time between activities**:
  - From "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:00) to "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (11:30): 2.5 hours.
  - From "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (11:30) to "Investigate Issue" (14:00): 2.5 hours.
  - From "Investigate Issue" (14:00) to "Resolve Ticket" (09:00 next day): 19 hours (likely overnight or unassigned work).

**Case 105**:
- **Escalation**: The ticket was escalated to Level-2 at 10:00 on 2024-03-01. The investigation by Level-2 started at 14:00 on 2024-03-02 (more than 28 hours later).
- **Total waiting time between activities**:
  - From "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (10:00 on 2024-03-01) to "Investigate Issue" (14:00 on 2024-03-02): 28 hours 40 minutes.
  - From "Investigate Issue" (14:00 on 2024-03-02) to "Resolve Ticket" (09:00 on 2024-03-03): 19 hours (overnight).

**Common Patterns**:
1. **Escalation Delays**: Both long-running cases involved escalations, and the investigation by Level-2 started significantly after the escalation.
2. **Long Waiting Times Between Activities**: The most significant delays occur between escalation and investigation (especially in Case 105), possibly due to:
   - Lack of available Level-2 agents.
   - Prioritization issues (Level-2 agents working on other tickets).
   - Unclear SLAs for escalation resolution.
3. **Overnight Delays**: Both cases had long gaps between investigation and resolution (19 hours), suggesting that Level-2 agents may not have prioritized or started working on the ticket immediately.

#### 3. Recommendations to Address Performance Bottlenecks
Based on the analysis, here are key insights and recommendations:

1. **Improve Escalation Handling**:
   - Set clear SLAs for escalation resolution (e.g., Level-2 agents must start investigating within 2 hours of escalation).
   - Implement alerting or auto-assignment for escalated tickets to ensure they are not overlooked.

2. **Reduce Waiting Times Between Activities**:
   - Monitor the time between escalation and investigation. If delays are frequent, investigate whether Level-2 agents are overloaded or if there are process gaps (e.g., manual assignment delays).
   - Ensure that Level-2 agents prioritize escalated tickets over new Level-1 tickets.

3. **Address Overnight Delays**:
   - If possible, assign escalated tickets to on-call Level-2 agents to reduce overnight waits.
   - Alternatively, require Level-2 agents to complete work within the same day (or within a few hours for critical tickets).

4. **Analyze Level-2 Agent Workload**:
   - Check if Level-2 agents are overloaded with too many escalated tickets, leading to delays. If so, consider redistributing work or hiring more Level-2 agents.

5. **Improve Process Visibility**:
   - Track metrics like "time to escalation," "time to investigation after escalation," and "time to resolution after investigation" to identify recurring bottlenecks.
   - Use dashboards to flag tickets that exceed expected timelines.

6. **Optimize Triage and Assignment**:
   - Review why some tickets are escalated earlier than others. If possible, triage tickets more accurately upfront to reduce unnecessary escalations.

### Conclusion
The primary causes of long resolution times are delays in handling escalated tickets (both in starting the investigation and completing the resolution). By improving escalation processes, setting stricter SLAs, and monitoring waiting times between activities, the support team can reduce average resolution times and improve customer satisfaction.
