========================
1. Normative-rule compliance
========================
• Case 1 – COMPLIANT  
  – Follows the exact mandatory order: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
  – No forbidden action is performed after rejection (the case was approved).

• Case 2 – VIOLATION  
  1. Risk Assessment is logged before the Credit Check, breaching the rule “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.”  
  2. The loan is rejected but “Finalize Documentation” is nevertheless performed, which is expressly disallowed after a rejection.  
  3. Despite the ordering mistake being “corrected” later (Credit Check appears after Risk Assessment), the mere occurrence of the wrong sequence constitutes a normative breach.  
   Result: Case 2 violates two independent hard rules.

• Case 3 – COMPLIANT  
  – Although some activities are late, every mandatory step appears in the correct order and the approved-path requirements (Finalize Documentation before Close) are satisfied.  


========================
2. Desiderata (soft-goal) compliance
========================
Desiderata are “nice-to-have.” Violating them is not a serious problem but indicates process quality issues.

• Recommended timing windows  
  – Credit Check within 24 h of application.  
  – Inform Applicant within 48 h of Loan Decision.  
  – Optional Follow-up Call before closing.

| Case | Credit-check timeliness | Inform timeliness | Follow-up Call | Desiderata verdict |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 0.5 h (OK)            | 2 h  (OK)         | Not done       | Minor deviation (missing call) |
| 2    | 40 min (OK)           | 30 min (OK)       | Not done       | Minor deviation (missing call) *(normative issues already present)* |
| 3    |  49 h (Late)         |  51 h (Late)     | Not done       | Several desiderata breaches |

Summary of soft-goal breaches  
• All cases omit the non-mandatory Follow-up Call.  
• Case 3 exceeds both suggested time windows.  
• Cases 1 and 2 meet the timing recommendations but still lack the courtesy call.

========================
3. Possible interpretations / justifications
========================
Case 1 (ideal path)  
• The file shows an efficient, compliant process; the missing Follow-up Call may be judged unnecessary because the applicant received rapid confirmation and documentation on the same day.

Case 2 (normative breaches)  
• The Risk Assessment before Credit Check could stem from a data-entry error or a rushed analyst starting the assessment before the credit data arrived.  
• Finalizing documentation after a rejection might reflect a misunderstanding of the system’s buttons (“Finalize” chosen instead of “Archive”) or an attempt to generate a formal rejection letter but mislabeled in the log.  
• Even if the team later performed the Credit Check, the initial ordering error and the finalize-after-rejection step still break the hard rules and should trigger corrective action.

Case 3 (desiderata delays)  
• The 48-hour gap before Credit Check and the additional two-day delay before informing the applicant likely indicate workload/backlog, missing paperwork from the customer, or waiting for an external credit-agency response.  
• Although slow, the case never violates normative constraints, so the process is legally correct but operationally sub-optimal.  
• Instituting a reminder system or escalating overdue tasks could bring future instances back within the desired time windows.
