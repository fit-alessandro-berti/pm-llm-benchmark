<think>We have a long question from user which describes an exercise regarding loan application process. It is divided into two parts: Part 1 (Normative Process Behavior) with strict rules about sequence of events; Part 2 (Desiderata or recommended practices) that are less important and not necessarily violations.

The table includes three cases:

- Case ID 1: 
    - Timestamp: 2024-01-10 09:00 "Application Received"
    - then 2024-01-10 09:30 "Credit Check"
    - then 2024-01-10 10:00 "Risk Assessment"
    - then 2024-01-10 11:00 "Loan Decision (Approved)"
    - then 2024-01-10 13:00 "Inform Applicant"
    - then 2024-01-10 13:30 "Finalize Documentation"
    - then 2024-01-10 14:00 "Close Case"

Check strict rules for case1:

Sequence is: Application Received, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case.
Rules:
- Credit check before risk assessment (9:30 vs 10:00).
- Risk assessment before loan decision (10:00 vs 11:00).
- Inform applicant after loan decision (13:00 is after 11:00). 
- If approved then finalize documentation before closing. Finalize Documentation occurs at 13:30 and Close Case at 14:00.
So case1 satisfies strict rules.

Case ID2:
Timestamps:
- Application Received: 2024-01-11 08:00
- Next event is Risk Assessment at 09:00 "Risk Assessment". But then later, at 09:20, there's Credit Check. However, the table says that timestamp for risk assessment is given as "2024-01-11 08:20" with comment "* (No prior Credit Check - violates normative)".
Wait check table: Actually table has: 
Case2:
Row: | 2       | 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment       | *(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)* |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check          |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation| *(Not allowed after rejection)* |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case |

Check sequence:
Strict rules for case2:
1. Application Received is correct.
2. Must do Credit Check before Risk Assessment but here risk assessment happened at 08:20 and credit check occurred later at 09:00. So that's a violation of normative order.
3. Also, Finalize Documentation should not be done if loan decision is rejected, yet there is finalization documentation performed (at 10:00) after the rejection decision (09:30). 
4. In addition, closing the case occurs at 10:30, but it's not even necessary to do finalize documentation if rejected. But they did perform finalizing documentation.
So, violations for Case2:
- Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check.
- Finalize Documentation was executed after rejection.

Thus violation of normative rules for case2 in two aspects.

Case ID3:
Timestamps: 
- Application Received at 2024-01-12 09:00.
- Then credit check on 2024-01-14 10:00. Note: comment says "*(Happened more than 24 hours later - just a desideratum violation)*". So it's after recommended window but still meets normative rules? It happened eventually, so order is correct. 
- Risk Assessment at 11:00 (2024-01-14).
- Loan Decision (Approved) at 12:00 (2024-01-14).
- Inform Applicant at 15:00 on 2024-01-16. Comment says "* (Later than recommended 48 hours - again a desideratum violation)*". So it is within normative sequence? But check strict rules:
- Credit Check occurred before Risk Assessment.
- Risk assessment then loan decision, then inform applicant. Yes, all steps are in order: credit check at 10:00 on Jan 14, risk at 11:00 same day, loan decision at 12:00 same day, inform applicant is at 15:00 on January 16 which is a delay of 26 hours after loan decision (which is above recommended 48 hours? Actually wait, recommended desideratum says should be within 48 hours. But check table's comment: "Later than recommended 48 hours". So that indicates not strictly violation but desideratum violation.)
- Then Finalize Documentation at 2024-01-17 09:00.
- Then Close Case at 2024-01-17 10:00.

Check normative rules for case3:
It is an approved loan decision. For an approved loan, we require that Finalize Documentation occurs before closing. Yes, it does (09:00 then close case 10:00).
Also check ordering of events: 
Application Received, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision, Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case.
So all normative rules are followed. So case3 doesn't violate the strict sequence norms.

Thus for part 1:
Violating normative rules:
Case2 violates: risk assessment performed before credit check, and finalization documentation after rejection is not allowed.
Maybe also check if any others? 
For case2, we see that there's missing follow-up call but that's desideratum.

So answer Part 1:
- Case2 is violating the normative rules for two reasons:
   * The risk assessment was performed before a credit check (which violates the required order).
   * Finalize Documentation was executed after loan decision rejected which should not happen.
Case1 and case3 satisfy strict sequence order.

Part 2: Identify which cases fail to meet desiderata conditions:
Desiderata are "recommended best practices" such as performing Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received, inform applicant promptly (within 48 hours from the loan decision), and follow up call before closing.
Case1: 
Check timing differences:
Application received at 09:00 Jan 10, credit check is at 09:30 which is well within 24 hours. Inform applicant at 13:00 Jan 10 which is less than 3 hours after loan decision (which happened at 11:00) so that's fine.
Finalize documentation and close case are in same day, no follow-up call information but not required by strict sequence? However, recommended best practice is Follow up call before closing. Case1 did not have a follow-up call in the table?
Wait check table for case1:
No follow-up call event listed. So desiderata violation might be: missing follow-up call.
But note that it's mentioned "Follow-up Call" as recommended. And the description says "it is encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case." In table, for case1 we don't see a follow up event. But then in the instructions: 
"In addition to the strict sequence, there are some recommended best practices... For example ... It is also encouraged – but not strictly required – to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case."
So if no follow-up call is present, it is just desideratum violation. But then "when possible, suggest interpretations or justifications for observed behaviors." So we can note that missing follow-up call in case1 might be considered as deviation from best practice but not a violation of normative rules.

Case2:
Desiderata: 
The credit check was done at 09:00 instead of within 24 hours. But here's what table says: "2024-01-11 08:20, Risk Assessment", then "2024-01-11 09:00, Credit Check". So in case2 the credit check is performed at 09:00 which is after risk assessment but it is within 24 hours of application received? Wait, check:
Case2 Application Received at 08:00 Jan 11. The credit check is at 09:00 on same day (just an hour later) so that is within the recommended window if we assume 24 hours requirement means ideally within 24 hours after application received. But then risk assessment should be done after credit check. However, desiderata might include other timing conditions for inform applicant prompt? For case2, the loan decision is at 09:30 and finalization documentation (which should not happen if rejected) but it's executed. And then close case is performed at 10:30. 
But the risk assessment was not done properly so that already violates normative rules.
Also check inform applicant in case2? But since loan decision was at 09:30, and then finalization documentation is at 10:00 (which is violation), and close case is 10:30, there's no record of inform applicant event for case2. Actually let me re-read table:
Case2 has events:
- Application Received at 08:00.
- Risk Assessment at 08:20 (with comment).
- Credit Check at 09:00.
- Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30.
- Finalize Documentation at 10:00.
- Close Case at 10:30.
So case2 never has an "Inform Applicant" event? Wait, check table row for case2:
I see rows:
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received  |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment       | *(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)* |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check          |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation| *(Not allowed after rejection)* |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case            |

It does not include "Inform Applicant", so maybe that's a violation of strict sequence? But note the text: "After receiving the application, a credit check must be performed before any risk evaluation is done. Once the credit check is completed, a risk assessment is conducted." So in case2, it is violating normative order because risk assessment happened before credit check.
Also then for loan decision we require inform applicant after loan decision. But it's missing entirely. So that might be an additional violation of normative rules. Let's double-check the strict sequence:
- It must be Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [if approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case.
Case2 does not have "Inform Applicant" event at all, so it violates that. But the question asks about desiderata conditions which are best practices rather than strict rules, and missing follow-up call is mentioned as recommended but not required? However, in case2, there's also a timing concern: Finalize Documentation performed after rejection. That is normative violation.
I might need to check which ones are violating the normative vs desiderata conditions.

Let's separate them:
Normative Violations:
Case1: None.
Case2: 
- Risk Assessment before Credit Check (violating sequence rule).
- Missing Inform Applicant event? But table says "Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30", then "Finalize Documentation" (should not happen), so that is normative violation. Also, Finalize Documentation is performed after rejection.
Case3: None.

Desiderata Violations:
- For case1, recommended credit check within 24 hours - it's fine; recommended inform applicant promptly - it's done at 13:00 which is less than 48 hours? But then finalization documentation and close case are same day so that's good. The only desideratum issue might be missing Follow-up Call event.
- For case2, although the Credit Check is performed within 24 hours (9:00 vs application at 08:00) but risk assessment is done without a credit check first, which is normative violation and not just desideratum. Also inform applicant is missing, and follow-up call is missing.
- For case3:
    - The Credit Check occurred at 2024-01-14 10:00 which is more than 24 hours after Application Received (09:00 on 12 Jan to 10:00 on 14 Jan is actually 2 days? Let's check: Application Received 2024-01-12 09:00, credit check at 2024-01-14 10:00. That is exactly 36 hours later, which violates the recommended timing of 24 hours). So that is a desideratum violation.
    - The Inform Applicant event occurred at 15:00 on 2024-01-16, which is more than 48 hours after loan decision? Actually check: Loan Decision (Approved) was at 12:00 Jan 14. Then inform applicant at 15:00 Jan 16 equals 26 hours later, but recommended is within 48 hours. Wait re-read the desiderata text: "it is preferred that ... the applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision)". But note the table comment says: "* (Later than recommended 48 hours - again a desideratum violation)*". So yes, it's a desideratum violation. 
    - Also case3 does not have a follow-up call event.
So summary:

Case1:
Normative: Compliant.
Desiderata: Missing Follow-up Call (if that's considered recommended best practice). 
Also perhaps timing for credit check and inform applicant are within acceptable ranges.

Case2:
Normative: Violates strict order because risk assessment is performed before credit check, missing "Inform Applicant" event (should be after loan decision) and finalizing documentation on rejected case. So normative violations.
Desiderata: It might also have a potential desideratum issue if any? The credit check and inform applicant are not in question for the desideratum because they're already in violation normatively, but we could note that missing Follow-up Call is also a recommended practice.

Case3:
Normative: Compliant.
Desiderata: Violates recommended timing windows (credit check took more than 24 hours after application received; inform applicant occurred later than recommended window of 48 hours) and no follow-up call event. So case3 has desideratum violations.

We need to provide a detailed explanation for each case, including which normative rules are violated and the reasons behind them, then list the desiderata deviations and possible interpretations or justifications.

Let's produce answer in markdown formatting with bullet points maybe.

I'll produce final answer message with disclaimer at beginning and end if required. Wait instructions: "You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above". It says:
"when providing sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters, you must include a disclaimer at beginning and end." But these are not specifically sensitive? The text describes loan application process. Not necessarily a sensitive topic but it is financial matter. So we should add disclaimers "This response does not constitute professional advice" etc.

But instructions from guidelines: "You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above." That means each answer on these topics should include disclaimers for sensitive topics such as medical, legal, financial matters. But here it is more about process improvement. It may be considered financial matter? The question is about loan application process. So I'll add disclaimer that "This response does not constitute professional advice" at beginning and end.

So we start with a disclaimer: "Disclaimer: This information is for general informational purposes only and should not be taken as professional or legal advice." And then at the end, repeat similar disclaimer.

Now produce answer:

I can structure it as follows:
Title: Analysis of Cases Based on Normative Process Behavior and Desiderata.

Then I'll have sections:
I. Normative Violations
- For each case list if they violate sequence rules.
Case 1: Compliant.
Case 2: Non-compliant due to:
   - Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (should be after credit check).
   - Missing "Inform Applicant" event which is required after loan decision.
   - Finalize Documentation is done for a rejected loan, violating the rule that documentation should not be finalized if rejected.

Case 3: Compliant regarding normative rules.
So answer: Case2 violates normative process behavior while cases1 and3 are compliant with strict sequence.

II. Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict) Deviations
- For each case, mention deviations from best practices:
Case1: 
   - Although not mentioned in table for follow-up call, it might be considered a recommended practice to perform a Follow-up Call before closing the case if possible.
   - Otherwise, credit check and inform applicant timing are acceptable.

Case2:
   - It has normative violations already; but also missing "Inform Applicant" is critical. But that's normative violation. Also no follow-up call event recorded, which violates recommended best practice.
   - The ordering issues overshadow the desiderata here.

Case3: 
   - Credit Check occurred more than 24 hours after application received (36 hours later) -> Desideratum violation regarding timely credit check.
   - Inform Applicant happened later than recommended 48 hours from loan decision (26 hours later? Actually check: Loan Decision at Jan 14 12:00, inform applicant on Jan 16 15:00. That is actually 2 days and 3 hours difference = 51 hours difference). So it's too late by desideratum recommendation.
   - Follow-up Call event is missing.

Maybe also mention that although these deviations are not severe violations of normative process rules, they indicate possible delays or misalignment in the process with best practices.

Then provide suggestions/interpretations:
- For case2: It appears there was a mistake in ordering the credit check and risk assessment. It might be due to oversight or system error, and finalizing documentation despite rejection suggests that process automation failed to branch properly.
- For case3: The delays in performing Credit Check and Inform Applicant could indicate resource constraints or procedural backlog; however, it's not strictly non-compliant but suboptimal performance relative to recommended timelines.

We can then produce answer with disclaimers at beginning and end.

I'll include markdown formatting. I'll ensure clarity and bullet list each case.

I'll produce final answer in a clear structured manner.

I'll now produce final answer.</think>Disclaimer: The following analysis is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute professional or legal advice.

Below is an assessment of the cases based on both the strict normative process rules and the recommended (desiderata) best practices.


1. Normative Process Behavior Violations

The strict sequence must be:
• Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [if Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case  
• If approved, Finalize Documentation must precede Closing; if rejected, documentation should not be finalized.

• Case 1 (ID 1):  
– All events occur in the proper order.  
– Credit Check is before Risk Assessment, which is before Loan Decision, followed by informing the applicant, then finalizing documentation (since it was approved) and closing the case.  
 No normative violations.

• Case 2 (ID 2):  
– Violation #1: The risk assessment occurs at 08:20 immediately after application receipt instead of after a credit check. According to the rules, the Credit Check must happen before any Risk Assessment. Here, the Credit Check is done later (at 09:00).  
– Violation #2: There is no record of an “Inform Applicant” event following the Loan Decision; informing the applicant is mandatory after making a decision.  
– Violation #3: Finalize Documentation is executed at 10:00 even though the loan was rejected at 09:30. The normative rule explicitly prohibits finalizing documentation when the decision is rejection.  
 Case 2 violates multiple normative rules.

• Case 3 (ID 3):  
– All events occur in the proper sequence.  
– The Credit Check happens after application receipt, followed by Risk Assessment, then Loan Decision (approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation (required for approval), and finally, Close Case.  
 No normative violations.


2. Desiderata (Recommended Best Practices) Deviations

These recommendations are not strictly enforced but indicate suboptimal performance when not followed:

• Case 1 (ID 1):  
– The Credit Check is completed at 09:30, well within the ideal window of 24 hours after receiving the application.  
– The applicant is informed promptly at 13:00 following the Loan Decision at 11:00 (within a reasonable timeframe).  
– However, there is no record of a Follow-up Call before closing the case—a recommended best practice to ensure alignment with the applicant.  
 The only deviation from desiderata is the absence of a follow-up call.

• Case 2 (ID 2):  
– Although not directly part of the timing recommendations for credit checks and informing applicants, the overall process issues overshadow these aspects.  
– In addition to the normative violations already noted (misordered events and finalizing documentation on a rejection), there is also no Follow-up Call recorded before case closure.  
 The deviations in Case 2 are primarily due to normative missteps rather than timing issues; however, the missing follow-up call also falls short of best practices.

• Case 3 (ID 3):  
– Desideratum Violation #1: The Credit Check is performed at 10:00 on January 14, which is more than 24 hours after the application was received at 09:00 on January 12. This delay may indicate resource constraints or process inefficiencies.  
– Desideratum Violation #2: The applicant is informed at 15:00 on January 16—this occurs later than the recommended 48 hours following the Loan Decision (approved at 12:00 on January 14).  
– Additionally, there is no Follow-up Call recorded before closing the case.  
 Case 3 shows multiple deviations from recommended best practices in terms of timing and follow-up communication.


Interpretations and Justifications

• For **Case 2**, the misordering (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and finalization on a rejected decision suggest a procedural error or system flaw. The absence of an “Inform Applicant” event further underscores process misalignment, while the missing follow-up call reflects an additional oversight.

• For **Case 3**, although all normative steps are correctly sequenced, the delays in executing the Credit Check and informing the applicant may be attributed to resource limitations, higher workload, or operational backlogs. The absence of a follow-up call suggests that there may be gaps in ensuring full communication alignment prior to closing the case.


Summary

• Normative Violations:  
– **Case 2** clearly violates the normative process rules by performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check, omitting the Inform Applicant step, and finalizing documentation on a rejected loan.  
– Cases 1 and 3 adhere to the strict sequential requirements.

• Desiderata Deviations:  
– **Case 1**: Only lacks the recommended Follow-up Call.  
– **Case 2**: While primarily suffering from normative errors, it also omits a follow-up call.  
– **Case 3**: Exhibits timing issues (delayed Credit Check and delayed Inform Applicant) as well as the absence of a follow-up call.

These insights indicate that while Cases 1 and 3 are compliant with the fundamental process rules, they would benefit from tighter adherence to recommended timings and communication practices. Case 2, however, requires significant process corrections to realign with both normative and desideratum requirements.
