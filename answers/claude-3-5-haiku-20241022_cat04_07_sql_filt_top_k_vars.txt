Here's a comprehensive DuckDB SQL solution that addresses all the requirements:

```sql
WITH 
-- Step 1: Order activities within each case by timestamp
case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '  ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

-- Step 2: Count frequency of each variant
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) AS variant_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),

-- Step 3: Identify top K variants (e.g., top 5)
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence 
    FROM variant_frequencies
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
    LIMIT 5  -- Adjust K here
),

-- Step 4: Filter cases to only include top K variant cases
top_k_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    JOIN top_k_variants tkv 
        ON cs.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
)

-- Final query: Return all events for top K variant cases
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN top_k_cases tkc 
    ON e.case_id = tkc.case_id
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

This solution breaks down the task into several Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

1. `case_sequences`: 
   - Groups events by `case_id`
   - Uses `STRING_AGG()` to create an ordered sequence of activities
   - Orders activities by timestamp to ensure correct sequence

2. `variant_frequencies`:
   - Counts distinct cases for each unique activity sequence
   - Determines how many cases follow each variant

3. `top_k_variants`:
   - Selects top K variants based on case count
   - Uses `LIMIT 5` (adjustable to any K)

4. `top_k_cases`:
   - Identifies cases that belong to top K variants

The final SELECT retrieves all events from these top K variant cases.

Key features:
- Uses window functions and aggregations
- Preserves case-level activity order
- Flexible variant selection
- Efficient filtering of events

Performance considerations:
- Indexes on `case_id` and `timestamp` recommended
- Adjust `LIMIT` for different K values
- For very large logs, consider additional optimization techniques

Example modifications:
- Change `LIMIT 5` to adjust top variant count
- Add more complex ordering/filtering as needed
