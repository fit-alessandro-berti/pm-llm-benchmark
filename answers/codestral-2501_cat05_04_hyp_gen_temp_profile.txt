### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: The average time is around 25 hours with a very low standard deviation, suggesting a rigid and possibly artificial schedule.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: An average delay of 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days indicates significant variability in notification times.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**: A relatively quick closure (2 hours on average) after assignment without intermediate steps like Evaluate or Approve suggests premature closure.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: Only 5 minutes on average between evaluation and notification suggests a rapid transition that might not align with business rules.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: The low standard deviation might indicate a rigid, possibly automated process that does not account for variability in claim complexity. This could be due to a system error or a manual override that consistently applies a fixed timeframe.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: The long average delay with high variability suggests potential bottlenecks or resource constraints. This could be due to manual data entry delays or inconsistencies in resource availability.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**: The quick closure without intermediate steps might indicate that some claims are being closed prematurely, possibly due to automated processes that do not require thorough evaluation.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: The rapid transition might indicate that some steps are being skipped, possibly due to automated processes that do not require thorough evaluation or notification.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Unusual Time Intervals**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce1.claim_id,
       ce1.activity AS activity1,
       ce2.activity AS activity2,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_interval
   FROM
       claim_events ce1
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE
       (ce1.activity, ce2.activity) IN (('R', 'P'), ('P', 'N'), ('A', 'C'), ('E', 'N'))
       AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) NOT BETWEEN
           (temporal_profile[(ce1.activity, ce2.activity)][0] - 3 * temporal_profile[(ce1.activity, ce2.activity)][1])
           AND
           (temporal_profile[(ce1.activity, ce2.activity)][0] + 3 * temporal_profile[(ce1.activity, ce2.activity)][1]);
   ```

2. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce.resource,
       COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
   FROM
       claim_events ce
   JOIN
       (SELECT
           ce1.claim_id,
           ce1.activity AS activity1,
           ce2.activity AS activity2,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_interval
        FROM
           claim_events ce1
        JOIN
           claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
        WHERE
           (ce1.activity, ce2.activity) IN (('R', 'P'), ('P', 'N'), ('A', 'C'), ('E', 'N'))
           AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) NOT BETWEEN
               (temporal_profile[(ce1.activity, ce2.activity)][0] - 3 * temporal_profile[(ce1.activity, ce2.activity)][1])
               AND
               (temporal_profile[(ce1.activity, ce2.activity)][0] + 3 * temporal_profile[(ce1.activity, ce2.activity)][1])
       ) anomalies ON ce.claim_id = anomalies.claim_id
   GROUP BY
       ce.resource;
   ```

3. **Filter Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce.claim_id,
       ce.timestamp AS assign_timestamp,
       ce2.timestamp AS close_timestamp,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS time_interval
   FROM
       claim_events ce
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE
       ce.activity = 'A'
       AND ce2.activity = 'C'
       AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) < 7200;
   ```

4. **Check Claims with Long Approval to Notification Times**:
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce.claim_id,
       ce.timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
       ce2.timestamp AS notify_timestamp,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS time_interval
   FROM
       claim_events ce
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE
       ce.activity = 'P'
       AND ce2.activity = 'N'
       AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) > 604800;
   ```

These queries help identify specific claims and resources where the temporal profile anomalies occur, allowing for further investigation and corrective action.
