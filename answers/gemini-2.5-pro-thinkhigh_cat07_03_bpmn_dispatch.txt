This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that illustrates the "Dispatch of goods" process for a "Computer Hardware Shop." The process involves three main participants or departments, represented by lanes: the **Secretary**, the **Warehouse**, and **Logistics**.

Here is a step-by-step description of the process flow:

1.  **Process Start:** The process begins with the "Ship goods" start event in the Secretary's lane.

2.  **Parallel Activities:** Immediately, the process splits into two parallel flows that occur at the same time:
    *   **Warehouse Flow:** The warehouse begins to "Package goods." There is a 48-hour timer attached to this task. If packaging is not completed within 48 hours, a notification is sent to the customer about the delay.
    *   **Secretary Flow:** Simultaneously, the secretary begins to "Clarify shipment method."

3.  **Decision on Handling:** After clarifying the shipment method, the secretary makes a decision based on whether "Special handling" is required.
    *   **If Yes (Special Handling):** The secretary must "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" and then "Select [the] logistic company and place [the] order."
    *   **If No (No Special Handling):** The process moves to "Check if insurance is required," a task that references "Order details" and "Customer information" data.

4.  **Insurance and Labeling:**
    *   After the insurance check, the process always proceeds to "Write package label."
    *   If insurance is deemed necessary, an additional, concurrent task is triggered: "Insure parcel," which is handled by the Logistics department.
    *   Once the parcel is insured (if applicable) and the label is written, these paths merge.

5.  **Synchronization:** The process flow waits at a parallel gateway in the Warehouse lane. This gateway ensures that all preceding tasks from both the Warehouse (packaging) and the Secretary/Logistics (paperwork, ordering, insurance) are complete before moving to the final steps.

6.  **Final Steps:** Once everything is synchronized, the process continues exclusively in the Warehouse lane:
    *   First, the warehouse staff "Fill out Shipment paperwork."
    *   Next, they "Move [the] package to [the] pickup area."

7.  **Process End:** The process concludes with the "Shipment prepared" end event, signifying that the package is ready for dispatch.
