Here are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, one with potential unfairness and one without:

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (XOR Branch for Community Affiliation)

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR branch for cultural fit vs. community affiliation
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, cultural_xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add edges to enforce ordering
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_xor)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**
- The process starts with `ReceiveApplication`, followed by a loop (`DataCompletenessCheck` and `RequestMoreInfo`) to ensure all data is complete.
- After the `SkillAssessment`, there is an XOR branch where applicants either go through a standard `CulturalFitCheck` or a `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (which may introduce bias).
- The process then proceeds to `ManagerialReview` and `FinalDecision`.

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness (No XOR Branch for Community Affiliation)

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add edges to enforce ordering
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**
- The process starts with `ReceiveApplication`, followed by a loop (`DataCompletenessCheck` and `RequestMoreInfo`) to ensure all data is complete.
- After the `SkillAssessment`, all applicants go through the same `CulturalFitCheck` (no XOR branch for community affiliation).
- The process then proceeds to `ManagerialReview` and `FinalDecision`.

### Key Differences:
- The first model includes an XOR branch (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`) that can introduce bias by giving preferential treatment to certain applicants.
- The second model removes this branch, ensuring all applicants are evaluated uniformly in the `CulturalFitCheck` step.

Both models maintain the same overall structure (e.g., loops for data completeness, sequential skill assessments) but differ in how they handle cultural fit evaluations.
