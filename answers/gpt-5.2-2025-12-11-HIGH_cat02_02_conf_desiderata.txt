## 1) Normative (strict) rule violations — by case

### Case 1
- **Normative status:** **Compliant**
- **Why:** Activities occur in the required order:
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
  - Approved-path logic is respected: **Finalize Documentation happens before Close Case**.

### Case 2
- **Normative status:** **Non-compliant (multiple hard violations)**
- **Violations:**
  1. **Ordering breach:** *Risk Assessment* occurs **before** *Credit Check*  
     - Required: Credit Check  Risk Assessment  
     - Observed: Risk Assessment (08:20)  Credit Check (09:00)
  2. **Missing mandatory step:** *Inform Applicant* is **absent** after the loan decision  
     - Required: Inform Applicant must occur **after** Loan Decision.
  3. **Contradictory action given rejection:** *Finalize Documentation* occurs **after** *Loan Decision (Rejected)*  
     - Required: If rejected, **do not finalize documentation**; close the case without it.

### Case 3
- **Normative status:** **Compliant**
- **Why:** Correct strict sequence and approved-path logic:
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
  - Finalize Documentation occurs before Close Case.

## 2) Desiderata (recommended) deviations — by case
*(These are “suboptimal” but not treated as serious non-compliance.)*

### Timing desiderata
- **Credit Check within ~24h of Application Received**
- **Inform Applicant within ~48h of Loan Decision**

### Follow-up call desideratum
- **Encouraged:** Follow-up Call sometime before closing (optional, not strict)

#### Case 1
- **Timing:** Meets both timing recommendations (Credit Check in 30 min; Inform Applicant 2 hours after decision).
- **Follow-up call:** **Not shown in the log.**
  - If follow-up calls are expected to be logged, this would be a **desideratum miss**.
  - If they are informal or logged elsewhere, it may be **unknown rather than missing**.

#### Case 2
- **Timing:** No clear timing desiderata issue (Credit Check and decision/inform timing can’t be assessed properly because **Inform Applicant is missing**).
- **Follow-up call:** Not shown (same “unknown vs missing” caveat as Case 1).

#### Case 3
- **Timing (both missed):**
  - Credit Check occurs ~49 hours after Application Received  **misses the 24h recommendation**
  - Inform Applicant occurs ~51 hours after Decision  **misses the 48h recommendation**
- **Follow-up call:** Explicitly **not done**  **desideratum miss**

## 3) Plausible interpretations / justifications (aligned with rules & recommendations)

### Case 1 (fully clean)
- Interprets as a “happy path” case with good operational responsiveness.
- If the follow-up call is expected but not logged, it could have been done via another channel/tool (CRM/phone system) and simply not captured in this event log.

### Case 2 (hard violations)
Possible explanations (none of these *justify* compliance-wise, but they can explain the behavior):
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** the team may have done a *preliminary* or *manual* risk screening based on application data while waiting for an external credit bureau response, and later recorded it as “Risk Assessment.”
- **Finalize Documentation after rejection:** could be:
  - a logging/labeling error (e.g., it was actually “Finalize Rejection Letter/Case Notes” but mapped to the wrong activity), or
  - the decision was changed later (rejected  approved) but the log only shows the first decision outcome.
- **Missing Inform Applicant:** might have happened but not been logged, or handled automatically (email/SMS) without integration into the event log.

### Case 3 (normatively correct but slow / suboptimal)
- **Delayed Credit Check:** could reflect external dependency delays (credit bureau outage), staffing backlog, or additional identity/KYC checks before initiating the credit pull.
- **Delayed Inform Applicant:** could be due to needing secondary review, waiting for customer contact availability, or batching communications.
- **No follow-up call:** could be intentional (e.g., applicant unreachable, customer opted out, or the organization only calls in certain risk tiers).

If you want, I can convert the strict rules and desiderata into explicit conformance checks (e.g., LTL/Declare-style constraints) and show exactly which events trigger which violations.
