Based on the provided directly follows graph for each object type, I can infer the following processes:

1. **Order Fulfillment Process:**
   - A customer places an order (`place order`).
   - The order is confirmed by either a customer or an employee (`confirm order`). This step has the highest frequency and duration among all transitions.
   - If items are in stock, they are picked (`pick item`) by an employee. If not, an item out of stock event occurs, leading to a reorder (`reorder item`), which eventually results in picking the item.
   - Once items are picked, a package is created (`create package`). This step has the second-highest frequency and duration after order confirmation.
   - The package is sent (`send package`).
   - Finally, the package is delivered (`package delivered`), and payment might be made or reminded (`pay order`, `payment reminder`).

2. **Payment Process:**
   - Payment can occur at various stages: before items are picked (after order confirmation), after items are picked but before the package is created, or after the package has been sent.
   - If not paid on time, a payment reminder might be issued.

3. **Employee Activities:**
   - Employees confirm orders, pick items, create packages, send packages, and handle out-of-stock situations by reordering items.
   - Some employees might also pay orders or receive payments (though this is less frequent).

4. **Product Activities:**
   - Products are picked for orders, placed in packages, and sent. They can also be paid for at various stages of the process.

5. **Package Process:**
   - Packages are created after items are picked, sent by employees, and eventually delivered to customers.

Here's a simplified overall process flow:

Customer  Place Order  Confirm Order  (Pick Item / Out of Stock)  Create Package  Send Package  Package Delivered  Pay Order

Some variations in this process exist due to different payment timings and out-of-stock situations. The most frequent paths involve order confirmation, item picking, package creation, sending, and delivery.

Durations provided give an idea of the time taken for each transition on average. For example, the 'confirm order' event takes around 104 seconds (1 minute 44 seconds) on average when followed by a 'place order' event in the orders object type.
