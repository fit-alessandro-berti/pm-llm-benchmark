Okay, let's analyze the event log against the provided normative process description.

**1. Identified Violations:**

* **Case 2:** Violates the sequence "Check inventory" -> "Authorize payment" -> "Package items" -> "Ship order".  The event log shows "Package items" occurring *before* "Authorize payment".
* **Case 3:** Violates the sequence "Check inventory" -> "Authorize payment" -> "Ship order". The event log shows "Ship order" occurring *before* "Authorize payment".
* **Case 4:** Violates the sequence "Check inventory" -> "Authorize payment". The event log shows "Authorize payment" occurring *before* "Check inventory".

**2. Explanation of Violations:**

Let's break down each violation with reference to the normative description:

* **Case 2:** The normative process explicitly states: "Authorize payment" should *only* occur *after* "Check inventory".  In Case 2, "Package items" is performed before "Authorize payment," directly contradicting this rule.  This suggests a potential error in the order of operations.

* **Case 3:**  Similarly, the normative process dictates that "Authorize payment" must precede "Ship order."  In Case 3, "Ship order" is performed before "Authorize payment." This indicates a deviation from the expected flow.

* **Case 4:** The normative process clearly states: "Authorize payment" should *only* occur *after* "Check inventory." In Case 4, "Authorize payment" is performed before "Check inventory." This is a direct violation of the stated constraint.

**Interpretation of Ambiguities:**

The description does allow for some interpretation regarding the timing of "Check inventory" and "Authorize payment."  It doesn't specify *how much* time should pass between these two activities.  However, the emphasis is on "before" – meaning "Check inventory" must happen *prior* to authorizing payment.  The same applies to "Package items" and "Ship order."

The description also doesn't explicitly forbid a "Cancel order" activity before "Check inventory." However, the overall flow is designed to avoid this.  The normative process is structured to minimize the chance of cancellation, and the sequence of activities is designed to ensure that fulfillment steps (packaging and shipping) are only performed when inventory is sufficient.

**Summary:**

Cases 2, 3, and 4 all represent deviations from the normative process.  These violations highlight potential issues in the order of operations, suggesting a need to review and correct the workflow to ensure adherence to the established process.  The core principle is that inventory checks and authorizations must precede fulfillment activities, and cancellation should be handled separately.
