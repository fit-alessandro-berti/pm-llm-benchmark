**Analysis and Activity Renaming:**

After analyzing the event log, we identified the following activities that appear multiple times within cases and require renaming to reflect their contextual differences:

1. **Initiate Request:** This activity is used for all cases, but the context changes based on the 'Resource' and 'Additional Context'.
    - **Context 1 (C001, C002):**  Customer initiated the request via the web portal.
    - **Context 2 (C003):** Customer initiated the request at a branch (walk-in).
    - **Renamed Activities:**
        - 'Initiate Request via Web Portal'
        - 'Initiate Request at Branch'

2. **Verify Documents:** This activity is repeated in cases C001 and C003, and appears once in C002. The context varies significantly.
    - **Context 1 (C001 - First Instance, C002):** Initial document verification, primarily for identity.
    - **Context 2 (C001 - Second Instance):** Re-verification after the customer submitted additional documents (ID scan).
    - **Context 3 (C003 - First Instance):** Physical, in-person document verification at a branch.
    - **Context 4 (C003 - Second Instance):** Re-verification of documents after an account adjustment was made.
    - **Renamed Activities:**
        - 'Initial Document Verification' (C001 - First Instance, C002)
        - 'Post-Submission Document Verification' (C001 - Second Instance)
        - 'In-Person Document Verification' (C003 - First Instance)
        - 'Post-Adjustment Document Re-verification' (C003 - Second Instance)

3. **Call Customer:** This activity is repeated in case C002 and appears in cases C001 and C003 with different purposes.
    - **Context 1 (C001):** Calling to request missing documents needed for verification.
    - **Context 2 (C002 - First Instance):** Calling to clarify an account discrepancy.
    - **Context 3 (C002 - Second Instance):** Follow-up call to confirm that account adjustments have been made.
    - **Context 4 (C003):** Calling the customer to return to the branch as they had stepped out.
    - **Renamed Activities:**
        - 'Request Missing Documents via Call' (C001)
        - 'Clarification Call Regarding Discrepancy' (C002 - First Instance)
        - 'Confirmation Call Post-Adjustment' (C002 - Second Instance)
        - 'Call Customer to Return to Branch' (C003)

4. **Adjust Account:** This activity appears in cases C002 and C003 with slightly different contexts.
    - **Context 1 (C002):** Account adjustment performed internally after a clarification call to resolve a discrepancy.
    - **Context 2 (C003):** Internal correction due to missing information, identified during the process.
    - **Renamed Activities:**
        - 'Discrepancy-Related Account Adjustment' (C002)
        - 'Missing Information Account Adjustment' (C003)

**Justification for Naming Choices:**

* **Initiate Request via Web Portal / at Branch:**  Distinguishes the initiation channel, crucial for understanding process variations based on customer interaction methods (online vs. in-person). The 'Resource' and 'Additional Context' clearly indicated the source of the request.
* **Initial Document Verification / Post-Submission Document Verification / In-Person Document Verification / Post-Adjustment Document Re-verification:** These names clearly differentiate the stages and context of document verification. 'Initial' and 'Post-Submission' highlight the sequence in C001. 'In-Person' specifies the verification type in C003. 'Post-Adjustment Re-verification' shows the dependency on a preceding activity in C003.
* **Request Missing Documents via Call / Clarification Call Regarding Discrepancy / Confirmation Call Post-Adjustment / Call Customer to Return to Branch:** These renamings specify the purpose of each 'Call Customer' activity.  They clarify *why* the customer is being called, which is vital for process understanding. The 'Additional Context' provided direct clues about the call's objective.
* **Discrepancy-Related Account Adjustment / Missing Information Account Adjustment:** These names contextualize the 'Adjust Account' activity by linking it to the reason for adjustment (discrepancy vs. missing information). This distinction is important for analyzing the causes of account adjustments within the workflow.

By renaming the activities with these contextual details, the event log becomes much more informative and easier to analyze, especially for process mining and understanding the nuances of the support workflow. Each activity now clearly reflects its role and purpose within the overall case flow.
