To construct the POWL model for the described digital service provisioning process, we need to follow the steps outlined in the scenario and use the appropriate classes and methods from the `pm4py` library. Below is the Python code that represents the described scenario:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Initial Service Request Verification
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")

# Step 2: Contract Setup
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# Step 3: Parallel Tasks - Datacenter Allocation and Access Control Initialization
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

# Step 4: Looped Configuration Phase
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
D_R = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")

# Loop between BNC and D&R
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Step 5: Exclusive Choice for Deployment
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")

# Exclusive choice between CD and MD
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 6: Final Tasks in Partial Order
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")

# Partial order for QA and SA
final_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# Step 7: Go-Live Approval
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Construct the root POWL model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, xor_deployment, final_tasks, GLA])

# Define the order between nodes
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor_deployment)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, QA)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, SA)
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Print the constructed POWL model
print(root)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Service Request Verification (SR)** and **Contract Setup (CS)** are sequential.
2. **Datacenter Allocation (DA)** and **Access Control Initialization (ACI)** can be done concurrently after **Contract Setup (CS)**.
3. **Base Network Configuration (BNC)** and **Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)** form a loop that repeats until the configuration is stable.
4. After the loop, there is an exclusive choice between **Containerized Deployment (CD)** and **Monolithic Deployment (MD)**.
5. **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Security Audit (SA)** can be done in any order or concurrently after the deployment.
6. **Go-Live Approval (GLA)** happens after both QA and SA are completed.

This code constructs the POWL model as described, ensuring that all dependencies and partial orders are correctly represented.
