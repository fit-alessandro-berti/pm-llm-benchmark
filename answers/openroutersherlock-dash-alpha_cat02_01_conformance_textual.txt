### Analysis of Event Log Cases

Below, I evaluate each case against the normative process description. The key rules derived from the description are:
- **Always starts with "Receive order"**, followed by **"Check inventory"** before any payment authorization or fulfillment decisions.
- **Sufficient inventory path**: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- **Insufficient inventory path**: Receive  Check  Cancel order  Close order (no fulfillment activities like Package, Ship, or Authorize Payment after Cancel).
- **Constraints**:
  - Authorize Payment only after Check inventory and before Package items.
  - Package items only after Authorize Payment and before Ship order.
  - Ship order only after Package items and never after Cancel order.
  - Close order is always the final activity.
- Deviations (e.g., out-of-order activities, fulfillment after cancellation, skipping required steps) are violations.

#### Case 1
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- **Compliant**: Perfectly matches the sufficient inventory path. No violations.

#### Case 2
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violates**:
  - "Package items" occurs **before "Authorize payment"**, violating the rule that payment must be authorized before packaging (description: "Authorize payment... before packaging"; "packaging items before authorization" is explicitly a deviation).
  - "Authorize payment" occurs **after "Package items"**, inverting the required order.
- Close order is final, and Check is before authorization, but the packaging-authorization order is a clear violation.

#### Case 3
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violates**:
  - "Authorize payment" occurs, followed by "Cancel order", but then **"Ship order" after cancellation**, violating the rule that fulfillment activities (like shipping) must not occur after cancellation (description: "it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment... after cancellation"; "shipping after cancellation" explicitly a violation).
  - Authorize Payment before Cancel is questionable (payment authorization shouldn't precede cancellation in insufficient inventory), but the post-cancellation shipping is the primary deviation.
- Close order is final, but the flow mixes paths illogically.

#### Case 4
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.
- **Compliant**: Perfectly matches the insufficient inventory path. No fulfillment activities post-cancellation. Close order is final.

#### Case 5
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violates**:
  - **"Ship order" occurs without preceding "Package items"**, violating the rule that items must be packaged before shipping (description: "Package items... before they can be shipped"; "Ship order should only occur after packaging").
  - Skips the required "Package items" step entirely in the sufficient inventory path.
- Check is before authorization, and Close is final, but skipping packaging is a clear structural deviation.

### Summary of Violating Cases
- **Violating cases**: 2, 3, 5.
- **Compliant cases**: 1, 4.
- No ambiguities in the description materially affect this analysis; the constraints are explicit about sequencing and branching, with examples of violations matching these cases directly. All cases start correctly with Receive  Check.
