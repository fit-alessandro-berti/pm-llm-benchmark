Looking at this global supply chain process for high-tech electronics, I'll estimate realistic temporal relationships based on typical industry practices. Here's a temporal profile dictionary with average times in seconds and their standard deviations:

```python
{
    # Direct sequential pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (432000, 172800),      # 5 days ± 2 days (supplier evaluation and negotiation)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1814400, 604800),     # 21 days ± 7 days (supplier lead time and shipping)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (28800, 14400),        # 8 hours ± 4 hours (immediate quality check)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 86400),       # 2 days ± 1 day (addressing quality issues if any)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),       # 3 days ± 1 day (complex assembly process)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 21600),        # 1 day ± 6 hours (testing and potential rework)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 7200),         # 4 hours ± 2 hours (packaging to warehouse transfer)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (432000, 259200),      # 5 days ± 3 days (demand-driven distribution)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 216000),      # 7 days ± 2.5 days (delivery to customer)
    
    # Multi-step relationships
    ('SS', 'RC'): (2246400, 630720),     # 26 days ± 7.3 days (procurement cycle)
    ('SS', 'CA'): (2447200, 639360),     # 28.3 days ± 7.4 days (procurement to assembly)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (2272320, 622080),     # 26.3 days ± 7.2 days (order to testing)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (993600, 293760),      # 11.5 days ± 3.4 days (components to distribution)
    ('QI', 'AS'): (1572480, 371520),     # 18.2 days ± 4.3 days (quality check to after-sales)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (794880, 276480),      # 9.2 days ± 3.2 days (assembly to distribution)
    ('PT', 'AS'): (1140480, 354240),     # 13.2 days ± 4.1 days (testing to after-sales)
    
    # Long-range relationships
    ('SS', 'DT'): (3240000, 734400),     # 37.5 days ± 8.5 days (supplier selection to distribution)
    ('OP', 'AS'): (3412800, 743040),     # 39.5 days ± 8.6 days (order placement to after-sales)
    ('RC', 'AS'): (1598400, 380160),     # 18.5 days ± 4.4 days (receiving to after-sales)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (2188800, 617472),     # 25.3 days ± 7.1 days (supplier selection to testing)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (968160, 285120),      # 11.2 days ± 3.3 days (quality inspection to distribution)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (1051200, 362880),     # 12.2 days ± 4.2 days (packaging to after-sales)

This temporal profile reflects the complexity of high-tech electronics manufacturing, where early stages (procurement) have higher variability due to supplier dependencies, while later stages (packaging, warehousing) are more controlled and predictable. The cumulative times and standard deviations account for the compound uncertainties as activities are separated by more intermediate steps.
