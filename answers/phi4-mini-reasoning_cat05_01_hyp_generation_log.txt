Okay, so I need to figure out how to approach this problem where the task is to identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in an order processing event log using SQL queries. The user mentioned that after hypothesizing why those anomalies occur, we should propose relevant SQL queries on `order_event_log` along with possibly `orders` and `resources`. 

First, let me recall what constitutes an anomaly or undesired behavior here. From the example data provided, each order (case_id) follows a specific sequence of activities according to the assumed normal process flow: Register Order  Perform Credit Check  Validate Stock  Confirm Shipment  Ship Goods  Issue Invoice  Receive Payment. So any deviation from this sequence could be considered an anomaly.

Looking at the examples given:

In the first example, case 1001 goes through all steps correctly without missing any. But in another table (the second one), there's a discrepancy: order 1002's resource for "Confirm Shipment" is LogisticsMgr_2 instead of SalesRep? Wait no, wait—the activities are supposed to be after Register Order. Let me check the normal process again. The first activity should always be 'Register Order', then next steps follow in sequence. So each case_id should have events that exactly match this order. If any step is missing or out-of-sequence, that's an anomaly.

Looking at example 1002: 

Case 1002's event IDs are 8 (Register), 9 (Confirm Shipment). Wait, after Register Order comes Perform Credit Check, then Validate Stock, etc. So for case 1002, the sequence should be:

1. Event 8: Register
2. Then event 11: Perform Credit Check? But in example 1002's data as shown earlier, under "Additional Reference Tables" it lists events up to 14. Wait no—the additional reference tables are separate from the actual `order_event_log`. The first two examples provided (like case 1001 and 1002) have their own event logs. Let me look again.

Wait in example data:

First example for case 1001 has all seven steps completed correctly.

Second example, case 1002: events listed are 8 to 14. Let's list them:

Case 1002's `order_event_log` entries as per the additional reference tables provided (the second table):

| event_id | activity            | timestamp      | resource          |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 8        | Register Order      | 08:20:00       | SalesRep_02       |
| 9        | Confirm Shipment    | 08:25:00       | LogisticsMgr_2     |
Wait, wait. Wait the activities should be in order after register. So for case 1002:

Event 8 is Register Order.

Then next expected activity would be Perform Credit Check (event_id 11?), but according to the actual data provided here, event 9 is "Confirm Shipment". That's a problem because it's out of sequence. Because after Confirm Shipment should come Ship Goods, then Issue Invoice, etc. But in this case, from Register Order directly jumping to Confirm Shipment? That would be missing Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock steps. So that's an anomaly.

So the issue here is that for some cases, not all required activities are present or they follow a different order than expected.

Another example: looking at 1004's event log:

Case 1004 has events 21 (Register), then skipping to Receive Payment immediately after? Let's see:

Event IDs in case 1004 as per the additional tables provided:

21: Register Order

22: Receive Payment  Wait, that's out of order. Because after registering an order, you should first perform credit check, validate stock, etc. So if a customer registers and then skips steps to issue invoice directly? That would be missing all middle steps.

Another anomaly is in case 1003 where Confirm Shipment comes before Perform Credit Check. Let's see:

Case 1003's events are:

15: Register Order

16: Perform Credit Check (correct order)

17: Ship Goods  But after credit check, the next should be Validate Stock. So shipping goods without validating stock would be an anomaly.

Wait no: the normal process is:

1. Register Order

2. Perform Credit Check

3. Validate Stock

4. Confirm Shipment

5. Ship Goods

6. Issue Invoice

7. Receive Payment

So for case 1003, after performing credit check (event 16), next should be validate stock (event 17). Then confirm shipment (18?), ship goods (19?), issue invoice (20?), receive payment (21?). Wait in the example data provided earlier:

Looking back at that table: 

For case 1003's event log as per the additional tables, it's:

| case_id | event_id | activity           | timestamp            | resource          |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
15        Register Order

16        Perform Credit Check

17        Ship Goods

18         Issue Invoice

19        Confirm Shipment

Wait no. Wait in the example data provided under "Additional Reference Tables", for case 1003, it's:

event_id | activity           | timestamp            | resource          |
|---------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
15: Register Order  event_id=15

16: Perform Credit Check  correct.

17: Ship Goods  which would come after Validate Stock. So this is out of order. Because after credit check, you should validate stock before confirming shipment and shipping goods. Therefore, in case 1003, the sequence is:

Register  Credit  Ship (wrong step here; it should be Validate)

So that's another anomaly.

Another example: case 1004's event log skips some steps entirely. It only has events for Register Order, Receive Payment, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, and Ship Goods? Wait let me check again the data provided:

In the additional reference tables under "order_event_log" examples (the fifth one):

Case 1004's `order_event_log` entries are:

event_id | activity            | timestamp            | resource          |
21: Register Order  case_id=1004

22: Receive Payment  but this should come after all steps except issue invoice. So if receive payment is recorded here without prior confirmation shipment and ship goods, that's missing data.

Wait no. The actual events for 1004 according to the example given are:

From the fifth table in the examples provided (the last one):

| case_id | event_id | activity            | timestamp            | resource          |
21: Register Order

22: Receive Payment  Wait, but this is out of order because after register you need perform credit check first. So if there's a record for receive payment without any prior steps except the initial registration? That would be an anomaly.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding how case_id relates to orders in `orders` table. For example, 1001's events have corresponding entry in `orders` with order_value=1250.00 which matches event 6 (issue invoice) additional_info amount=1250.00. But for other cases like 1004, the `order_event_log` has only a few entries and no matching `orders` table row? Wait looking at the orders reference tables:

The orders table rows are:

| case_id | customer_id | order_type | order_value |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 1001    | 501         | standard   | 1250.00     |
| 1002    | 502         | priority   | 2000.00     |
| 1003    | 503         | standard   | 1500.00     |
| 1004    | 504         | standard   | 3000.00     |

So each case_id in `order_event_log` should have a corresponding row in orders? But for example, case 1004's event log has events but the orders table only lists order_value=3000.00 under customer 504 and case_id 1004 (assuming that is correct). So maybe that's not an issue here.

Back to anomalies:

In some cases, activities are out of sequence or missing steps.

So possible approaches for detecting such anomalies would be:

1. For each `case_id`, check if the order of events matches exactly with the assumed process flow.
2. Identify any case where a step is skipped (missing event), appears in the wrong order, has an unexpected activity type not listed in the normal sequence.

Possible SQL queries to detect these could include checking for cases that have no 'Perform Credit Check' after Register Order before Validate Stock; or orders missing steps like Receive Payment without having Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods prior. Also looking at resources assigned—if a non-relevant resource is involved, but maybe that's more about the person performing activities rather than sequence.

Another anomaly could be if an activity occurs out of order relative to previous events for that case_id. For example, in some cases, 'Receive Payment' might appear before 'Issue Invoice', which shouldn't happen because invoice issuance typically happens after shipment and credit check.

So possible SQL queries:

- To find missing steps: using window functions or self-joins to compare the sequence of each case's event IDs against expected order. If any step is skipped (e.g., Perform Credit Check appears but then no Validate Stock), that's an anomaly.

- Checking for activities that are not in their correct position relative to previous events.

For example, a query could check if after 'Register Order', there exists both 'Perform Credit Check' and 'Validate Stock' before any later steps like 'Confirm Shipment'.

Another approach is to use recursive CTEs or sequence checks. For each case_id, the next expected activity ID should increment by 1 from previous event IDs in order.

So for a given case, if we track the last `event_id`, it should be one more than the previous (if events are ordered). But perhaps they aren't stored as sequential integers? In the examples provided, event_ids seem to start at 1 and go up. For example, first table has event IDs from 1 to 7 for case 1001. Second example starts with 8-14, third 15-20 (assuming each is incrementing by 5?), fourth one skips some numbers.

Assuming that `event_id` in the order_event_log are sequential and unique per case starting at 1 or higher depending on previous logs. So for a given case, if we have event_ids like [1,2,3,...], that's correct. If there's a gap (like missing ID), then it's an anomaly.

But maybe `event_id` is not necessarily consecutive. However, in the examples provided, they are sequential within each table's data but across different cases? For example, first case has events 1-7; second case starts at 8 and goes up to 14 (but only some). Third case starts at 15-20. Fourth case is incomplete.

Assuming that `event_id` for a given case should start from the next available integer after any existing event IDs in other cases? Not necessarily, but perhaps each new order gets its own starting sequence of events. So if you have multiple orders processed sequentially by different resources (like overlapping processes?), then their `event_id`s might not be consecutive.

So this approach may not hold across all data. Instead, it's more about the relative ordering within a case's event log.

Thus, to check for each case whether its sequence of activities follows exactly the required steps in order.

Possible SQL approaches:

1. For each case, generate the expected next activity based on current last `activity`. Compare with actual next step (using window functions like LEAD or LAG).

For example:

WITH ordered AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    event_id,
    activity,
    LAG(1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as prev_event_id,
    LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
)

Then, create a CASE expression to check if the current `activity` matches the expected next activity given the previous one.

But this requires knowing what is the correct sequence of activities. For example:

Expected sequences for each step after Register Order would be in fixed positions: after registering (step1), you must have Perform Credit Check (step2) before Validate Stock (step3), etc.

So perhaps using a CTE that defines the expected order, and then compare actual events to this sequence.

For instance, create an array or mapping of each activity's position. For example:

ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE = {
  'Register Order': 1,
  'Perform Credit Check': 2,
  'Validate Stock': 3,
  'Confirm Shipment': 4,
  'Ship Goods':5,
  'Issue Invoice':6,
  'Receive Payment':7
}

Then, for each case's event log (ordered by event_id), check if the sequence of activities matches this mapping.

If any activity in a certain position doesn't match the expected one based on previous steps, that's an anomaly.

So first step: create a CTE with CASE expressions indicating what should be at which position given prior events.

But how to model that? Maybe using recursive queries or dynamic SQL. Alternatively, for each case_id and event order (based on `event_id`), check the sequence of activities against the expected next activity in the normal process flow.

For example:

- The first occurrence must be 'Register Order'.
- After that, if it's not followed by 'Perform Credit Check', that's an anomaly.
- Then after performing credit check, it should go to 'Validate Stock' before anything else like Confirm Shipment or Ship Goods.

So possible SQL steps:

1. For each case_id and event order (based on `event_id`), track the expected next activity based on previous activities in that case.

2. Compare with actual activities: if there's a mismatch, flag as anomaly.

This could be done using window functions to look at the current activity versus what's supposed to come after the previous ones.

For example:

WITH RECURSIVE sequence AS (
  SELECT
    oce.case_id,
    oce.event_id,
    oce.activity,
    CASE
      WHEN oce.activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
      WHEN LAG(1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) = '' AND oce.activity != 'Register Order' THEN 2 -- This is not the right approach; need a better way.
    END AS expected_next_position,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as rn
  FROM order_event_log oce
)
But this seems messy. Alternatively, create an array for each case that holds the sequence of activities and compare with the ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE.

Another approach is to use dynamic SQL or a recursive CTE where we build the expected next activity based on prior steps.

Alternatively, check if after 'Register Order', all subsequent steps in order appear without gaps until completing the process. For example:

A case is complete (all 7 steps done) only when it has no missing steps and follows the correct sequence up to that point.

But how do we detect incomplete cases? Maybe by checking which `case_id`s have event_ids beyond a certain count but lack some mandatory step.

Alternatively, for each case, check if every activity in its log appears in order according to the process flow. If any deviation occurs (like an out-of-order activity or missing one), it's considered anomalous.

So possible SQL queries:

1. Detect cases where 'Perform Credit Check' is present but no subsequent steps like 'Validate Stock', etc.

2. Cases where activities are not in sequence: e.g., after 'Register Order', next step should be 'Perform Credit Check'. If there's another activity before that, it's a problem.

A way to model this could be:

For each case_id and event order (based on `event_id`), the expected current activity is determined by how many steps have been completed in sequence so far. For example:

- 0 steps: next must be 'Register Order'

Once step 1 ('Register') is done, next must be 'Perform Credit Check' (step2)

Then after that, any of the following can occur? No, because you can't jump to Confirm Shipment without first doing Validate Stock.

Wait no. The sequence is linear and fixed: each activity follows only one specific previous activity.

Thus, for example:

After step 1 ('Register Order'), next must be 'Perform Credit Check' (step2)

Then after that, the next possible steps are either 'Validate Stock', or if you could jump to later steps but that's not allowed in this model. Because according to the normal process flow provided, it's linear: each activity follows only one specific previous step.

Therefore, for a case to be correct:

After registering (step1), must perform credit check (step2)

Then after performing credit check, can proceed to validate stock (step3) or any subsequent steps? Wait no. Because the normal process flow is sequential and doesn't allow skipping intermediate steps.

Wait according to the assumed normal process flow: it's linear from Register Order  Credit Check  Validate Stock  Confirm Shipment  Ship Goods  Issue Invoice  Receive Payment.

So each activity must come after its predecessor in this fixed sequence, with none skipped or out of order. So for example:

After 'Register Order' (step1), next is 'Perform Credit Check' (step2)

Then after step2 comes 'Validate Stock' (step3) only if you haven't already gone to a later step.

Wait no. The process flow doesn't allow skipping steps. Each activity must be done in order, without omissions or out-of-sequence processing.

Therefore, for each case, the sequence of activities must exactly follow this order: Register Order  Perform Credit Check  Validate Stock  Confirm Shipment  Ship Goods  Issue Invoice  Receive Payment.

So if any step is missing, duplicated (which isn't possible as event_id are unique), or occurs in a different position relative to previous steps, it's considered an anomaly.

Therefore, SQL queries can be designed to check for these conditions:

1. All seven activities must appear exactly once each and in the correct order.

2. No activity appears out of sequence with respect to its predecessor(s).

3. Some cases might have extra events (if new orders are inserted while existing ones continue), but assuming event_id increments per case, this may not be a problem.

But given that `event_id` could start at different numbers across tables or rows, the approach must check for each row in order of increasing `event_id`.

Assuming that within a single table's data (like one example reference table) all events are ordered by event_id and per case they should follow 1 to n where n is number of steps.

But given varying start points across different orders' event logs, perhaps we need for each row in the order_event_log check whether it follows the correct sequence up to that point based on previous rows (same case).

Thus, using window functions like LAG or LEAD over PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id to compare current activity vs expected.

For example:

A query could be structured as:

SELECT
  case_id,
  event_id,
  activity,
  CASE 
    WHEN LAG(1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) = '' AND activity = 'Register Order' THEN TRUE
    WHEN LAG(1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) = 'Perform Credit Check'
      AND activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN FALSE -- anomaly if after credit check, validate stock is expected next step. But in the example 1003, it's Ship Goods instead of Validate Stock.

Wait this approach might not be correct because it assumes that each subsequent activity must follow exactly one specific previous step without considering any branching or skipping allowed by process (though according to assumed normal flow, no branching).

Alternatively, for a case, once you have performed 'Perform Credit Check', the next expected activities are only those after in the sequence. So if there's an anomaly where a later activity appears before prior ones.

But this seems complex with SQL unless we predefine the allowed sequences and then check each step against its predecessor's requirements.

Another approach is to create a lookup table of all possible valid sequences for a case, but that's not feasible dynamically.

Alternatively, use recursive queries in PostgreSQL that generate the sequence steps up to where an anomaly occurs.

For example:

A recursive CTE could build the expected sequence until detecting a deviation. But this would require checking each step against its predecessor's allowed next activity.

But perhaps simpler: for any row after 'Perform Credit Check', check if subsequent activities are only ones from positions 4 onward in the process (e.g., Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, etc.) but that allows skipping steps which is not acceptable here.

No, because according to the normal flow, you can't skip Validate Stock. So even if after credit check someone does 'Confirm Shipment', that's an anomaly.

Thus, for each case and row in order of event_id:

- If activity == 'Perform Credit Check' AND current position > 2 (i.e., not first three steps), then any subsequent activities that are not the next ones (Validate Stock) would be anomalies. But how to model this?

Alternatively, create a CTE where for each case and row in order of event_id:

Define variables indicating which step is currently being processed.

For example:

- Step 1: 'Register Order'

Once that's done, any activity that isn't 'Perform Credit Check' at the next expected position would be an anomaly. But how to calculate positions dynamically?

This seems tricky with SQL unless we use a recursive CTE or maintain state across rows for each case.

Given the complexity, perhaps using window functions in combination:

For example, track when each step was last completed per case.

But I'm not sure about that approach.

Alternatively, check if all steps after 'Perform Credit Check' are either skipped (missing) and then catch up later. For instance, a case might have Perform Credit Check, skip Validate Stock but include Confirm Shipment next. That's an anomaly because it missed the step between them.

Thus, to detect such cases:

For each occurrence of 'Validate Stock', check if there is no subsequent activity in order until reaching steps after (e.g., later than this one).

But again, how?

Perhaps a better approach: For any case that includes both 'Perform Credit Check' and then either skips to Validate Stock without completing all previous steps or goes out-of-order.

Alternatively, use window functions to check for each row if the current activity is not what it should be given prior activities in sequence.

For example:

With ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE as a constant mapping of expected activities by their order (1: Register Order, 2: Perform Credit Check, etc.), then for each row, determine which step it's on based on how many steps have been completed so far. Then check if current activity matches the next expected one.

But implementing this in SQL requires dynamic logic.

Alternatively, use a CTE that builds an array of activities per case and compares it to ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE.

But arrays are not straightforward with SQL unless using generate_series or recursive CTEs.

Another idea: For each row (event) in order_event_log, check if the activity is part of the process flow. But since all given examples have valid steps except for anomalies like those mentioned earlier, maybe this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, look for cases where an activity occurs that shouldn't follow any previous step according to the normal process.

For example:

- After 'Register Order', anything other than 'Perform Credit Check' is invalid (but in reality, some resources might perform activities out of order? According to the assumption it's not allowed.)

But if we assume the model must strictly follow the sequence, then such cases are anomalies.

So possible SQL queries could include checks like:

1. Detecting any row after step 2 ('Perform Credit Check') that is not 'Validate Stock' or later steps in expected sequence (but this allows skipping which isn't correct).

Hmm, no. Because according to process flow, you can't skip Validate Stock; it must come next.

Therefore, the only valid way to proceed from Perform Credit Check is to do 'Validate Stock', then subsequent activities.

Thus, any row after step 2 with activity not equal to 'Validate Stock' would be an anomaly unless it's part of a later correct sequence. But according to process flow, you can't jump ahead steps like going directly from credit check to confirm shipment; that's skipped validate stock and is therefore invalid.

Therefore, SQL queries could look for:

- Any row after step 2 with activity not equal to 'Validate Stock'.

But how do we determine which rows are part of the same case? Because each new order gets its own sequence starting at event_id=1. So if two orders from different cases (different case_ids) have overlapping events, they can't be compared.

Wait in PostgreSQL, a table can have duplicate foreign keys referencing another table's primary key. But here, `order_event_log.case_id` matches `orders.case_id`. However, each order may generate multiple event logs as it progresses through the process steps? Or is each row in order_event_log a single activity for an order?

Assuming that each row represents a step (activity) of processing one order, then case_ids are unique per table and different rows belong to different orders. But no—`order_id` or `case_id` can be repeated across tables as long as they match.

But given the data examples provided, it's more likely that multiple orders have their own event logs within a single table (since each example shows a case with 7-14 events). So in this context, 'case_id' refers to an order processed through several activities. Each activity is part of processing one order, and thus `order_event_log` has rows corresponding to different steps for the same order.

Therefore, when checking for anomalies within a single order (same case_id), we need to check if its sequence follows the correct process flow.

Thus, using window functions in each table's data would allow us to compare prior activities per case to current one.

Possible SQL approach:

For each row in `order_event_log`, determine what step it should be based on previous steps for that order. If any deviation is found (e.g., after 'Perform Credit Check', next activity isn't 'Validate Stock'), then mark as anomaly.

This can be done with a CTE using LAG or LEAD to track the previous activity per case, and compare against expected sequence.

For example:

A query like this could generate flags for anomalies where steps are skipped or out of order.

But implementing that would require writing complex SQL logic. Given time constraints as an assistant, perhaps it's better to outline possible queries rather than write exact ones.

Possible anomaly detection strategies via SQL:

1. Cases with missing activities: For example, orders that only have 'Register Order' and no subsequent steps (though unlikely given the examples).

2. Orders where after 'Perform Credit Check', they skip to later steps like Confirm Shipment without doing Validate Stock in between. This can be detected by checking if an order contains both 'Validate Stock' and then a step that comes before it would logically follow.

But how?

Another approach: For each occurrence of 'Validate Stock', check whether there's any activity after it which is out-of-sequence (i.e., another action should come instead). But this requires knowing the allowed activities in subsequent steps, which are limited to those following Validate Stock according to process flow.

Alternatively, create a list of valid sequences and compare against actual sequences. For example, for each case_id:

Check if all seven activities appear exactly once and in order.

This can be done using CTEs with arrays or by comparing cumulative sums.

For instance:

With ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE as:
CREATE TABLE act_seq (
    seq_num integer,
    activity varchar
);

INSERT INTO act_seq (seq_num, activity)
VALUES 
(1, 'Register Order'),
(2, 'Perform Credit Check'),
(3, 'Validate Stock'),
(4, 'Confirm Shipment'),
(5, 'Ship Goods'),
(6, 'Issue Invoice'),
(7, 'Receive Payment');

Then for each case_id and row in order_event_log ordered by event_id:

Check if the sequence of activities up to current step matches ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE[1], [2], ..., seq_num.

But this requires dynamic comparison which might be challenging with standard SQL.

Alternatively, use a recursive CTE that builds the expected activity at each position for a given case and compare against actual rows.

For example:

WITH RECURSIVE order_seq AS (
  SELECT
    o.case_id,
    oce.event_id,
    oce.activity,
    ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE.seq_num + ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY oce.case_id ORDER BY oce.event_id) as current_step
  FROM order_event_log oce
)
Then, for each row in this CTE where activity != expected_act_seq.current_step, mark it as anomaly.

But implementing this requires dynamic SQL and might not be straightforward with standard SQL functions.

Given the complexity, perhaps a simpler approach is to write queries that flag cases missing required steps or out-of-sequence activities.

For example:

Query 1: Detect orders that do not have 'Perform Credit Check' after 'Register Order'.

This can be done by selecting rows where activity is 'Perform Credit Check' and there are no subsequent steps (Validate Stock, etc.) until the process completes. But this isn't precise as some orders might skip intermediate steps.

Alternatively, detect any order that has a step other than expected ones in sequence after Register Order.

But how?

Another idea: Use window functions to check for each row if activity matches the expected next one given previous activities.

For example:

A CTE where we determine the current step based on prior activities. For instance:

With RECURSIVE order_flow AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    event_id,
    activity,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as rn,
    LAG(1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
),
ACTIVITIES AS (
  SELECT
    OF.case_id,
    OF.event_id,
    OF.activity,
    CASE 
      WHEN ACTIVITIES.prev_activity = '' AND activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
      WHEN ACTIVITIES.prev_activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
        AND (CASE WHEN prev_activity IS NULL OR previous is not Perform Credit Check) THEN 2 -- Not sure.
    END AS expected_next_step
  FROM order_flow OF LEFT JOIN ACTIVITIES ON OF.case_id = ACTIVITIES.case_id
)
But this approach might not work because LAG returns the previous activity, and we need to track which step was last completed.

Alternatively:

A CTE that tracks for each case how many steps have been followed correctly. For example:

With RECURSIVE correct_order AS (
  SELECT
    oce.case_id,
    oce.event_id,
    oce.activity,
    COALESCE(COUNT(k2.activity) FILTER (WHERE k2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'),0) + 
    COALESCE(COUNT(k3.activity) FILTER (WHERE k3.activity = 'Validate Stock'),0) +
    ... AS current_step
  FROM order_event_log oce
  LEFT JOIN order_event_log k2 ON oce.case_id = k2.case_id AND oce.event_id < k2.event_id AND k2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
  LEFT JOIN order_event_log k3 ON oce.event_id < k3.event_id AND k3.activity = 'Validate Stock'
  GROUP BY oce.case_id, oce.activity
)
Then check if current_step equals the expected step based on previous activities.

But this is getting too complicated. 

Perhaps a more pragmatic approach: write SQL queries that flag common anomalies observed in examples:

1. Orders where after Register Order, there's no Perform Credit Check (or it's followed by an activity other than Validate Stock):

This can be detected with:
SELECT * FROM order_event_log
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log o2
  WHERE o2.case_id = o.case_id AND o2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE case_id = ocase_id
);

But this doesn't check for sequence.

Alternatively, a query to find any row after step 2 (Perform Credit Check) that is not the next expected activity:

Using window functions:

WITH ordered_events AS (
  SELECT
    CASE_ID,
    EVENT_ID,
    ACTIVITY,
    LEAD(1) OVER (PARTITION BY CASE_ID ORDER BY EVENT_ID) as Next_Activity
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT * 
FROM ordered_events
WHERE Activity <> 'Perform Credit Check' AND Next_Activity IS NOT NULL;

This would flag rows where the current activity is not Perform Credit Check and there is a next expected activity, which should only be that after step 2.

But this doesn't check for skipping steps. For example, if an order has Register Order  Perform Credit Check  Confirm Shipment (skipping Validate Stock), then according to our logic, since Next_Activity after 'Perform Credit Check' would expect the user to have done nothing next unless it's a later activity in sequence. Wait no—because LEAD(1) over orders steps based on event_id order.

If an order skips step 3 and goes directly from Perform Credit Check (step2) to Confirm Shipment (step4), then ordered_events where Activity is 'Perform Credit Check' would have Next_Activity = 'Validate Stock', but if there's no Validate Stock activity before that row, the LEAD might not return anything.

This approach isn't sufficient as it doesn't check for missing intermediate steps. It only checks whether after a certain step, there are activities outside of what's allowed next in sequence.

But according to process flow, once you have performed 'Perform Credit Check', you must do Validate Stock before any later steps like Confirm Shipment or Ship Goods. So skipping is not allowed.

Thus, the LEAD approach may help catch some anomalies where after Perform Credit Check, there's an activity that's out of order (like jumping ahead), but it would miss cases where intermediate steps are skipped and then filled in with correct subsequent steps without affecting the overall sequence beyond that point.

Therefore, this method isn't perfect but can flag certain types of anomalies like:

- Orders missing any step after 'Perform Credit Check' before reaching later ones. For example, an order has Perform Credit Check  Skip Validate Stock and go to Confirm Shipment directly would have LEAD(1) returning the next activity as what? It depends on how event_id is ordered. If no subsequent activities for validate stock exist between those two rows (e.g., one row with 'Perform Credit Check' at event_id=3, then another with 'Confirm Shipment' later), but there's a gap in LEAD(1) which might not return anything.

This suggests that using window functions to check the sequence relative to previous steps is necessary.

Another possible approach is to use a CTE where we track for each case and its current position. For example:

With RECURSIVE process_flow AS (
  SELECT
    oce.case_id,
    oce.event_id,
    oce.activity,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY oce.case_id ORDER BY oce.event_id) as rn,
    CASE 
      WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
      WHEN previous_activity IS NULL AND rn = 1 THEN 2 -- After first step, next should be Perform Credit Check
      WHEN previous_activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND rn > 2 THEN rn - 3 -- If current position is more than expected after credit check, but this doesn't account for skipped steps.
    END AS current_expected_step,
    CASE 
      WHEN ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE.seq_num = rn THEN activity
      ELSE NULL
    END as correct_activity
  FROM order_event_log oce
)
But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, create a CTE that generates the expected sequence and compare each row to its position in this sequence.

For example:

ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE (as before) with seq_num from 1 to7.

Then for each case_id, generate an array of ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE.seq_nums up to current steps. Then check if the activities match exactly these numbers in order.

But creating such a dynamic comparison is complex without using procedural SQL or temporary tables.

Given time constraints and complexity, perhaps it's best to outline possible SQL queries that can be written to detect anomalies:

1. Orders missing 'Perform Credit Check' after 'Register Order':
   SELECT case_id FROM orders o
   WHERE EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled 
      JOIN orders od ON oled.case_id = od.case_id AND oled.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
     )
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) <7;

But this doesn't check for sequence.

2. Orders where after 'Perform Credit Check', there's an out-of-sequence step like skipping Validate Stock and going to Confirm Shipment:
   SELECT * FROM order_event_log oled1
   JOIN orders o ON oled1.case_id = o.case_id
   WHERE EXISTS (
     SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled2
     WHERE oled2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
       AND oled2.case_id = oled1.case_id
       AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled3
         WHERE oled3.activity = 'Validate Stock'
           AND oled3.case_id = oled2.case_id
               AND oled3.event_id > oled2.event_id
       )
   );

This query finds cases where there's a Perform Credit Check event, and no Validate Stock occurs after it before any later steps.

But this is just one possible anomaly to detect.

Another approach: For each case, check if all subsequent activities occur in order from the point of 'Perform Credit Check' onward. This can be done using window functions:

SELECT
  oled.case_id,
  oled.event_id,
  oled.activity,
  LAG(1) OVER (PARTITION BY oled.case_id ORDER BY oled.event_id) as prev_activity,
  LEAD(1) OVER (PARTITION BY oled.case_id ORDER BY oled.event_id) as next_activity,

-- Determine the expected next activity given previous
CASE 
  WHEN prev_activity IS NULL AND current_activity = 'Register Order' THEN 2 -- After step 1, expect Perform Credit Check

  WHEN prev_activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND current_activity <> 'Validate Stock' THEN 7 END as anomaly_flag,

FROM order_event_log oled;

But this isn't correct because if after performing credit check you skip validate stock and then do a later activity that is allowed (like confirm shipment), the next expected would still be validate stock, making it an anomaly.

Thus, any occurrence of 'Validate Stock' must come immediately after 'Perform Credit Check', otherwise it's missing or out-of-sequence.

So perhaps:

SELECT * FROM order_event_log
WHERE (
  CASE 
    WHEN previous_activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
      AND current_activity <> 'Validate Stock' THEN TRUE
    ELSE FALSE
  END,
  -- Check if the next activity after credit check is not validate stock, then flag anomaly.
  LEAD(1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) IS NOT NULL 
);

But again, this requires knowing what should come next.

Given the complexity and time constraints, I'll outline a set of SQL queries that can detect different types of anomalies:

**Anomaly Type 1: Missing 'Perform Credit Check' after 'Register Order'**
This would be cases where there's no activity for Perform Credit Check following Register Order. However, this isn't necessarily an anomaly if it happens early but is followed by subsequent steps.

**Anomaly Type 2: Skipped 'Validate Stock' step (e.g., order does Confirm Shipment without Validate Stock in between)**
SQL:
```sql
SELECT ocase_id
FROM orders o
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled 
  WHERE oled.case_id = o.case_id AND oled.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
)
AND EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled2 
  WHERE oled2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND oled2.case_id = o.case_id
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled3 
    WHERE oled3.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND oled3.case_id = o.case_id 
      AND oled3.event_id > (SELECT MIN(event_id) FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = o.case_id AND activity = 'Perform Credit Check')
  )
);
```

**Anomaly Type 3: Out-of-Order Activities**
Example where Confirm Shipment comes before Validate Stock.
SQL:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_event_log oled1
JOIN orders o ON oled1.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE (
  (oled1.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled2 
    WHERE oled2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
      AND oled2.case_id = oled1.case_id
      AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled3 
        WHERE oled3.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
          AND oled3.case_id = oled1.case_id
          AND oled3.event_id > (SELECT MIN(event_id) FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = ocase_id AND activity = 'Perform Credit Check')
      )
    ) OR (
  -- Other cases where activities are out of sequence
);
```

**Anomaly Type 4: Extra Steps Without Completing Previous Ones**
Orders that skip intermediate steps and then add later ones.
SQL:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_event_log oled1
JOIN orders o ON oled1.case_id = o.case_id
GROUP BY o.case_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE)
```
Where ACTIVITY_SEQUENCE is the predefined sequence.

**Anomaly Type 5: Duplicate Activities**
Not applicable as event_ids are unique per table, but activities can repeat in invalid order.
SQL:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (
  SELECT case_id,
         activity,
         LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) AS prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
) sub
WHERE activity = prev_activity;
```
This flags duplicate activities which aren't allowed.

**Anomaly Type 6: Receiving Payment Before Issuing Invoice**
SQL:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_event_log oled1
JOIN orders o ON oled1.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE (
  (oled1.activity = 'Issue Invoice') AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log oled2 
    WHERE oled2.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND oled2.case_id = ocase_id
      AND NOT EXISTS (
        -- Check if all steps after credit check have been done, but this is complex.
      )
);
```

However, these queries are not exhaustive and require further refinement. The key takeaway is that SQL can be used to compare the sequence of activities per case against the expected process flow using window functions, recursive CTEs, or by checking for missing steps through EXISTS conditions.

The final answer would present a set of hypotheses based on common anomalies observed in examples (e.g., skipped steps, out-of-sequence actions) and propose SQL queries to detect them.
</think>

To identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the `order_event_log` table relative to the assumed process flow, we can use the following hypotheses and corresponding SQL queries:

### Hypotheses for Anomalies
1. **Missing or Skipped Steps**: Orders that skip mandatory steps (e.g., skipping "Validate Stock" after "Perform Credit Check").
2. **Out-of-Order Activities**: Activities occurring in an incorrect sequence relative to the process flow.
3. **Extra Steps Without Completing Prior Ones**: Adding later steps without completing all required prior steps.

### SQL Queries

#### 1. Detect Orders Missing `Perform Credit Check` After `Register Order`
```sql
SELECT ocase_id, MIN(event_timestamp) AS earliest_credit_check_time
FROM orders o
JOIN order_event_log oled ON o.case_id = oled.case_id AND oled.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
GROUP BY ocase_id;
```
**Purpose**: Identify cases where no credit check activity exists after registration.

#### 2. Detect Skipped "Validate Stock" After `Perform Credit Check`
```sql
WITH valid_activities AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id, MIN(event_timestamp) AS earliest_validate_stock_time
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
),
skipped_validation AS (
  SELECT ocase_id
  FROM orders o
  JOIN valid_activities va ON o.case_id = va.case_id
  LEFT JOIN skipped_skipped_validation skv
    ON o.case_id = skv.case_id
  WHERE skv.earliest_validate_stock_time IS NULL;
)
SELECT case_id, earliest_credit_check_time, current_date - earliest_credit_check_time AS hours_since_credit_check
FROM skipped_validation;
```
**Purpose**: Flag orders where no "Validate Stock" occurred after `Perform Credit Check`.

#### 3. Detect Out-of-Order Activities (e.g., Confirm Shipment Before Validate Stock)
```sql
WITH credit_check AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id, MIN(event_timestamp) AS earliest_credit_time
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
),
validate_stock_after AS (
  SELECT cs.case_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN vs.earliest_validate_stock_time IS NOT NULL THEN vs.earliest_validate_stock_time END) AS validate_date
  FROM credit_check cs
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id, MIN(event_timestamp) AS earliest_validate_stock_time
    FROM order_event_log
    WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock'
  ) vs ON cs.case_id = vs.case_id
),
out_of_order AS (
  SELECT cs.case_id
  FROM credit_check cs
  CROSS JOIN validate_stock_after vs
  WHERE vs.validate_date IS NOT NULL AND cs.earliest_credit_time > vs.earliest_validate_stock_time
)
SELECT case_id
FROM out_of_order;
```
**Purpose**: Find cases where "Validate Stock" occurs after `Perform Credit Check` but before a later required step (e.g., "Confirm Shipment").

#### 4. Detect Extra Steps Without Completing Prior Ones
```sql
WITH completed_steps AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN event_timestamp END) AS invoice_time,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN event_timestamp END) AS payment_time
  FROM order_event_log
),
incomplete_orders AS (
  SELECT cs.case_id, MIN(event_timestamp) AS min_credit_check
  FROM credit_check cs
  GROUP BY cs.case_id
)
SELECT icase_id
FROM incomplete_orders
JOIN completed_steps cs ON icase_id = cs.case_id
WHERE invoice_time IS NOT NULL AND payment_time IS NOT NULL;
```
**Purpose**: Identify orders where later steps (e.g., "Issue Invoice", "Receive Payment") are recorded before completing all mandatory prior steps.

### Conclusion
By applying these SQL queries, we can systematically detect common anomalies such as missing or skipped steps, out-of-sequence activities, and incomplete order processing. Adjustments may be needed based on specific business rules or additional data context.
