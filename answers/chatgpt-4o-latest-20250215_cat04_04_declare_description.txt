This DECLARE model outlines a structured loan approval process, ensuring compliance, risk management, and operational efficiency. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how the process unfolds, along with explanations of how the constraints maintain order and prevent errors.

---

### **Step-by-Step Loan Approval Process**
1. **Receive Application (Initiating Event)**
   - The process starts when a customer submits a loan application (**init constraint**).
   - This step is **mandatory** (**existence constraint**), meaning the process cannot proceed without an application.

2. **Preliminary Credit Check (Required Next Step)**
   - A **response constraint** ensures that every application triggers a **Preliminary_Credit_Check**.
   - This step assesses the applicantâ€™s creditworthiness and risk level before moving forward.
   - The **exactly_one constraint** ensures only one preliminary check occurs per application.

3. **Gather Additional Documents (After Credit Check)**
   - A **succession constraint** enforces that after the credit check, additional documents must be gathered (e.g., proof of income, tax returns).
   - This prevents unnecessary documentation requests before confirming basic eligibility.

4. **Quality Assurance Review (Verifying Offer Compliance)**
   - **Responded existence** ensures that if an offer package is assembled, it must be reviewed.
   - **Precedence** dictates that this review must occur **before** contract terms are authorized.
   - This guarantees regulatory compliance and accuracy before final approval.

5. **Authorize Contract Terms (Final Decision)**
   - A **coexistence constraint** ensures that before contract terms are authorized, necessary documents must be gathered.
   - **Chainprecedence** enforces that contract authorization cannot occur before a **Preliminary_Credit_Check**.
   - Prevents unauthorized or incomplete loan approvals.

6. **Assemble Loan Offer Package (Post-Authorization)**
   - Once contract terms are authorized, the offer package is finalized.
   - **Chainsuccession** ensures that after quality review, the offer is assembled and prepared for disbursement.

7. **Transfer Funds (Only After Offer Finalization)**
   - **Chainresponse** ensures that assembling a loan offer must trigger a funds transfer.
   - However, **noncoexistence** ensures that funds are **never** transferred before receiving an application (i.e., no premature payouts).

8. **Notify Customer (Mandatory Communication)**
   - **Altresponse** ensures that when funds are transferred, the customer must be notified.
   - **Altprecedence** enforces that notification must happen before the funds transfer.

### **How Constraints Maintain Order & Compliance**
- **Risk Prevention:** Credit checks and documentation must occur before approving or disbursing a loan.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** A **forbidden action** (**absence constraint**) prevents bypassing compliance steps.
- **Operational Best Practices:** Ensuring proper sequencing avoids errors, reduces processing delays, and improves customer experience.

### **Consequences of Rule Violations**
- **Skipping Preliminary Checks:** Approving loans without credit checks increases default risk.
- **Disbursing Funds Early:** Could lead to fraud or financial losses.
- **Omitting Customer Notification:** Leads to customer confusion, complaints, and regulatory penalties.

By enforcing these constraints, the DECLARE model ensures a **logical, efficient, and compliant** loan approval process.
