**Explanation of Logic:**

1. **Case Identification:** 
   - I identified two distinct cases based on user interactions with Microsoft Word documents. The first case includes activities primarily surrounding the document `Document1.docx`, and the second involves `Quarterly_Report.docx`. 
   - The switch from one document to another and the respective operations performed create logical boundaries for these cases.

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - Low-level actions from the system log were translated into higher-level descriptions. For example:
     - "FOCUS" further detailed as "Open Document" and "Focus on Document" to clarify user intent.
     - "TYPING" actions were named to reflect what the user was typing (specific tasks such as draft introductions, meeting details, etc.).
     - The "SAVE" actions consistently resulted in "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet" according to the context of the application used.

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - Each event is tied to a unique `Case ID`, a descriptive `Activity Name`, and retains the `Timestamp` from the original logs, making it clear when each activity occurred.
   
4. **Coherent Narrative:**
   - The data captures a series of work steps that follow a logical flow. The user opens and interacts with documents, switches between applications, types responses or updates, and saves their work systematically, illuminating their workflow clearly to any analyst reviewing the log. 

The event log created is structured for effective process mining analysis and allows for insightful patterns to be discovered in the user's working habits.
