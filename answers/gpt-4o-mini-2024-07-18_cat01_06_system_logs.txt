### Explanation of Case Grouping and Activity Naming

1. **Case Identification**:
   - The events were grouped into three distinct "cases" based on the user’s interaction patterns and the primary work items (documents or tasks) they were dealing with.
   - **Case 1**: All activities related to the initial document, shifting to email management, and then opening a PDF.
   - **Case 2**: All activities related to modifying a budget spreadsheet.
   - **Case 3**: Activities related to the final document, returning focus to it and completing further edits.

2. **Activity Naming**:
   - Low-level actions were abstracted into more meaningful activities:
     - `FOCUS` becomes `Focus on Document` or `Focus on Budget`, indicating that the user is starting work on these items.
     - `TYPING` events were categorized as `Typing in Document` or `Typing in Budget` to convey meaningful context for the actions.
     - `SAVE` events were generalized into `Save Document` or `Save Budget`, capturing the act of preserving the work done.
     - Other actions like `SWITCH`, `CLICK`, `SCROLL`, and `HIGHLIGHT` were similarly transformed into descriptive phrases that simplify understanding for analysis.

Through this transformation, the newly structured event log establishes a clearer narrative of the user's workflow, facilitating analysis of the user's process and performance in managing documents and communications.
