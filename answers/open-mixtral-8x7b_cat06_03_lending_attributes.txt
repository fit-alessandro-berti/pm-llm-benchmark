When considering fairness in a process, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially lead to discrimination or bias in the way people are treated. These attributes often relate to personal characteristics such as race, gender, age, or other protected attributes.

In the given event log, the sensitive attributes that could potentially impact fairness are:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute distinguishes between citizens and non-citizens, which could lead to unequal treatment based on national origin or immigration status.
2. `case:gender`: Gender is a common sensitive attribute, as it could lead to discrimination or bias based on someone's gender identity.
3. `case:german speaking`: While not a typical sensitive attribute, language proficiency or accent might lead to discrimination or bias in some contexts. It is essential to evaluate whether this attribute could lead to unfair treatment in the given process.

It is essential to ensure that these sensitive attributes do not negatively influence the process's outcome, as this could lead to unfair or biased treatment of individuals or groups. Perform a thorough analysis and consider implementing fairness-aware process mining techniques to ensure that no discrimination occurs during the process execution.
