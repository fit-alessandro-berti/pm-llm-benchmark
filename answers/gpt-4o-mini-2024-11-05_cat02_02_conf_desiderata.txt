### Part 1: Normative Violations

1. **Case ID 2:**
   - **Violation:** Risk Assessment occurred **before** the Credit Check.
     - **Reason:** According to the normative rules, a **Credit Check** must be performed before the **Risk Assessment**. In this case, Risk Assessment occurred at 08:20 AM, but the Credit Check did not happen until 09:00 AM, violating this strict ordering rule.

   - **Violation:** Finalize Documentation occurred **after** a rejected loan decision.
     - **Reason:** If the loan decision is **rejected**, the normative rule clearly states that **Finalize Documentation** should not be performed before closing the case. In this case, the loan was rejected (at 09:30 AM), but the documentation was finalized at 10:00 AM, which contradicts the normative rules.

2. **Case ID 3:**
   - **No violations of normative rules.** All the activities in Case ID 3 follow the prescribed sequence and order, including:
     - Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case.
     - No steps were skipped, nor was there an out-of-order sequence. The only issues are related to the desiderata.

### Part 2: Desiderata Violations

1. **Case ID 2:**
   - **Violation of Desiderata (Timing of Credit Check):** The Credit Check occurred **20 minutes after** the Risk Assessment, which is a violation of the recommended best practice (performing Credit Check within 24 hours of receiving the application). While this is not a critical violation, it goes against the recommendation that the credit check should occur promptly after receiving the application.
   
   - **Violation of Desiderata (Finalize Documentation after Rejection):** Finalizing documentation after a rejected loan is a **serious violation of normative rules**, but it's also considered a violation of best practices. Finalizing documentation after a rejection is not just a deviation from the sequence, but also an inefficient and unnecessary step when the loan is not approved. While not inherently harmful, it's a suboptimal practice.
   
2. **Case ID 3:**
   - **Violation of Desiderata (Timing of Credit Check):** The Credit Check took **more than 24 hours** after the application was received (from 09:00 AM on 2024-01-12 to 10:00 AM on 2024-01-14), which goes against the recommended best practice. While this is not a normative violation, it does not meet the ideal performance of the process.
   
   - **Violation of Desiderata (Timing of Informing Applicant):** The **Inform Applicant** activity was completed **48 hours after the loan decision** (Loan Decision made at 12:00 PM on 2024-01-14, but the applicant was informed at 3:00 PM on 2024-01-16). According to the best practice, the applicant should ideally be informed **within 48 hours**. Although it's a minor delay, it's a deviation from the recommended timeline.
   
   - **Violation of Desiderata (Follow-up Call):** The **Follow-up Call** was skipped in this case. While this is not a critical issue and does not directly affect the loan process, it would have been optimal to include a follow-up call for better communication and alignment. This is a missed opportunity for engagement with the applicant.

### Summary:

- **Normative Violations:**
  - **Case 2:** Risk Assessment before Credit Check, Finalizing documentation after a rejection.
  
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Case 2:** Delayed Credit Check (20 minutes after Risk Assessment), Finalizing documentation after rejection.
  - **Case 3:** Delayed Credit Check (over 24 hours), Informing Applicant too late (48+ hours), Skipping the Follow-up Call.

These issues reflect either a strict failure to adhere to normative rules or a suboptimal performance in line with the recommended best practices (desiderata). While the desiderata violations are less severe, they indicate areas where the process could be improved to enhance efficiency and alignment with best practices.
