Typical P2P “happypath” (minor variants exist, but the control points are wellknown):

1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve PR (authorisation)  
3. Issue / transmit Purchase Order (PO) to the vendor  
4. Vendor ships – company performs Goods Receipt (GR)  
5. Vendor sends Invoice – company books Invoice Received (IR)  
6. Threeway match (PO  GR  IR) or at least a twoway match  
7. Release / execute Payment  
8. Close the case

The control logic behind this order is:

• No commitment (PO) before internal approval.  
• No payment before the liability is validated (invoice) and the goods/services are proven to be received (GR).  
• Every step should occur once (or a justified number of times) and in the expected order.

Below is what we observe in each case and why it is considered anomalous.

--------------------------------------------------
CASE 1001 – “Textbook” – no anomalies  
--------------------------------------------------
Sequence matches the happy path: PR  Approval  PO  GR  IR  Match  Payment  Close.

--------------------------------------------------
CASE 1002 – Multiple control violations  
--------------------------------------------------
Observed order:
1 PR created  
2 PO issued (before approval)  
3 Invoice received  
4 Payment released  
5 PR approved (after payment!)  
6 GR  
7 Invoice/PO match  
8 Close

Why it is problematic:
• PO before authorisation  bypass of spend approval.  
• Invoice and, even worse, Payment occur before the requisition is approved and before the goods are received. This breaks both the “authorisation” and the “existence” controls—money is disbursed without evidence that the purchase was legitimate or that the goods were delivered.  
• Threeway match executed after payment; the control becomes useless.  
• High fraud / duplicatepayment / cashloss risk; also possible violation of SOXstyle internalcontrol requirements.

--------------------------------------------------
CASE 1003 – Premature payment / possible prepayment without documentation  
--------------------------------------------------
Sequence:
PR  Approval  PO  Payment  Invoice  GR  Match  Close

Why it is problematic:
• Payment is made before both the supplier’s invoice and the goods receipt. If this were an intentional prepayment it should have been coded differently (e.g., “Advance Payment”) and should still have required at least a proforma invoice.  
• The invoice arrives one day after payment; the goods arrive two days after payment. The company has no legal document or physical proof at the time of cash outflow.  
• Threeway match again happens after the money is gone.  
• Risk of overpayment, nondelivery, or supplier default; weak audit trail.

--------------------------------------------------
CASE 1004 – Retroactive (maverick) purchasing  
--------------------------------------------------
Sequence:
PR  Approval  GR  PO  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close

Why it is problematic:
• Goods Receipt precedes the issuance of the PO (and therefore any contractual commitment to the supplier). This indicates:  
  – “Maverick buying” (user ordered directly, then asked purchasing to clean up the paperwork), or  
  – Emergency receipt without a contract.  
• Although payment occurs after invoice/match (good), the retroactive PO undermines price, term and quantity controls, exposes the company to unnegotiated prices, and weakens legal leverage with the vendor.  
• Depending on policy, the PObeforeGR rule is often a hard control for inventory valuation and liability recognition; its violation may trigger accounting adjustments.

--------------------------------------------------
Summary of Anomalies
1. Approval after PO (Case 1002).  
2. Payment before GR/Invoice/Match (Cases 1002, 1003).  
3. Invoice before GR and match before GR (Case 1002).  
4. GR before PO (Case 1004).  
All of the above breach standard P2P controls designed to prevent unauthorised spending, ensure receipt of value, avoid overpayments, and maintain a clean audit trail.
