Below is a short “textbook” reference sequence for a Procure-to-Pay case followed by a case-by-case analysis of the log.

Typical high-level sequence (simplified 3-way-match variant)

1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve PR  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Vendor ships / Receive Goods  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice + Goods + PO (3-way match)  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

The steps are normally blocking: you should not move to the next step until the prerequisite is completed, because every step adds a control that protects the company against loss or fraud.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Case-by-case observations
----------------------------------------------------------------
Case 1001 – “Happy path” (no anomaly)  
Sequence is perfectly aligned with the reference flow. Goods and invoice arrive before matching; payment is released only after the match.

Case 1002 – Multiple control violations
1. PO before PR approval  
   • 08:40 PO is issued although the PR is still unapproved (approval happens two days later).  
   • Risk: bypasses budgetary / authorization control.

2. Invoice and Payment before Goods Receipt  
   • Invoice arrives 2024-02-03 07:00 and payment is released 15 minutes later – before any proof that the goods were delivered (goods are received 2024-02-04).  
   • Risk: the company pays for something it has not yet received.

3. Payment before 3-way match  
   • Payment is on 2024-02-03 but the match activity is only on 2024-02-05.  
   • Risk: key control (quantity-price-receipt check) is skipped when the money leaves the company.

4. Approval after payment  
   • PR approval occurs long after cash left the company, which totally defeats the purpose of the approval.

Case 1003 – Premature payment / “pay-first” anomaly
1. Payment released before Invoice and before Goods  
   • Payment on 2024-02-08. Invoice arrives next day; goods two days later.  
   • Unless this is a formally documented pre-payment, it violates standard policy.

2. Payment before 3-way match  
   • Same control gap as in Case 1002 (match comes three days after payment).

3. Invoice received after payment  
   • Paying without a legal invoice can create tax-compliance issues and makes it difficult to reclaim money if something goes wrong.

Case 1004 – “Maverick buying” / Goods before PO
1. Goods received before PO issued  
   • Goods receipt 2024-02-06 09:00, PO issued 15 minutes later.  
   • Indicates the supplier shipped without a formal order or that the buyer created a “retro-fit” PO to legalize an off-system purchase.  
   • Risks: no contractual terms in place at time of shipment, potential pricing or liability disputes, SOX / audit finding.

2. Lead-time implausibility  
   • Receiving goods the day after the PR suggests the supplier was engaged before any internal approval (“maverick buying”).

(Other steps are in correct order; once the PO is back-dated the rest of the flow is normal.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Why the anomalies matter
----------------------------------------------------------------
• Financial exposure – Paying before receipt or match can lead to unrecoverable losses if goods never arrive or are defective.  
• Compliance & audit findings – SOX, ISO 9001, or internal control frameworks require evidence of approval and matching before payment.  
• Budgetary control – Issuing POs without an approved requisition circumvents spending limits.  
• Contractual risk – Receiving goods without a PO means no agreed price, delivery terms, or liability allocation.  
• Fraud opportunity – Employees could collude with a vendor to issue and pay invoices without proper approval.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------
• Case 1001 is the only clean instance.  
• Case 1002 violates approval, 3-way match, and receipt-before-payment rules.  
• Case 1003 shows a “pay-first” pattern (payment precedes invoice, goods, and match).  
• Case 1004 shows “maverick buying”: goods are received before a PO exists.

All highlighted sequences deviate from standard P2P best practices and would normally trigger an internal-control alert or an auditor’s exception note.
