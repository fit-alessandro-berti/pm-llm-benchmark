Here’s a list of targeted, open-ended questions I would ask the interviewee to clarify and deepen my understanding of the property onboarding process:
Initial Contact and Documentation:
What typically prompts a landlord to reach out to your company initially, and how do they usually make that first contact?
How does the property coordinator determine whether a document like an inspection report is "outdated," and what’s the threshold for requesting updates?
Are there common challenges landlords face in providing the required documentation, and how does your team assist them in those cases?
Property Manager Assignment:
Can you walk me through how you weigh factors like workload versus geographic specialization when assigning a property manager? Is there a formal scoring system or is it more judgment-based?
How do you define “unique requirements” for landlords, and can you give an example of how a property manager’s past experience matched those needs?
What happens if no property manager perfectly fits the criteria for a new property—how do you handle that mismatch?
Landlord-Manager Alignment:
During the introductory meeting with the landlord, what are the most common special conditions or policies that come up, and how are disagreements resolved?
How do you ensure that both the landlord and property manager leave that meeting with the same expectations—what’s your process for confirming alignment?
Inspection and Photography:
How do you coordinate schedules between photographers, inspectors, and landlords, especially if the property is in a different city from the regional office?
What kinds of issues does the inspector typically find, and how do you decide whether to involve the landlord or handle repairs internally?
How long does it usually take to resolve inspection issues, and what’s the process if a landlord pushes back on recommended fixes?
Marketing and Pricing:
How does the digital marketing team determine the final rental price range—do they ever override the landlord’s expectations, and if so, how is that negotiated?
What market trends do you look at when updating pricing models, and how often do those models get refreshed?
Are there specific features or amenities that tend to require special marketing attention, like pools or smart home systems?
Tenant Screening and Leasing:
What’s the most challenging part of the tenant screening process, and how do you balance speed with thoroughness when there’s a lot of interest in a property?
How do you decide whether to offer a promotional discount versus prioritizing a longer lease term when negotiating with prospective tenants?
Can you describe a situation where the tenant selection process got complicated—how did you resolve it?
Quality Checks and Audits:
What are the most common issues a compliance officer finds when reviewing leases, and how are those typically corrected?
How does the financial analyst ensure the rental price aligns with profitability targets—what happens if there’s a mismatch?
What kinds of errors has the IT department caught in the online listing or data integration, and how do those get fixed?
Timing and Sequencing:
On average, how long does the entire onboarding process take from initial contact to tenant move-in, and where do delays most often occur?
Are there any steps that can happen in parallel—like marketing prep and inspections—or is everything strictly sequential?
How do you prioritize tasks when onboarding multiple properties at once in the same region?
Exceptions and Edge Cases:
Can you give an example of a property that required special insurance—how did that affect the onboarding process?
How do you handle a landlord who insists on custom lease clauses that don’t align with your standard policies—what’s the approval process for that?
What’s the trickiest exception you’ve encountered in onboarding, and how did your team adapt to get it resolved?
Communication and Tools:
How do you ensure clear communication between regional offices, property managers, and support teams when there are so many stakeholders involved?
What’s the biggest challenge with relying on email threads, CRMs, and project management tools—have you ever lost track of something critical?
How often do landlords reach out with questions or changes during onboarding, and who’s responsible for keeping them updated?
These questions aim to uncover nuances in decision-making, explore how the process adapts to real-world variability, and clarify the interplay between roles, timing, and exceptions—without diving into technical implementation details.
