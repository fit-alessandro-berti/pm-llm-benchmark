Below is one way to write the query. This query first groups events by case_id to determine the count of events per case. It then filters out cases that have more than six events and returns the complete event details for the remaining cases:

------------------------------------------------
WITH eligible_cases AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN eligible_cases AS ec
  ON e.case_id = ec.case_id;
------------------------------------------------

You could also use a subquery instead of a CTE:

------------------------------------------------
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
------------------------------------------------

Both approaches ensure that only the events from cases with six or fewer events are returned.
