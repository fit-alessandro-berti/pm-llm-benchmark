## Phase 1: Idle / Initialization (Events 1–3)  
**Events:** 1 (08:00:00), 2 (08:00:05), 3 (08:00:10)  
**Sensor Pattern:**  
- Temperature steady at ~20 °C  
- Pressure 1 bar  
- Vibration 0 Hz  
- Material flow 0 units/s  
- Tool position 0 mm  
- Low baseline energy (0.4–0.5 kWh)  

**Rationale:**  
With all actuators inactive (no flow, no tool movement, zero vibration) and minimal energy draw, the machine is clearly not performing any production task. This steady “baseline” state indicates either the very start of a cycle (system boot-up/warm-up) or an idle standby waiting for the next workpiece.

## Phase 2: Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)  
**Events:** 4 (08:00:15), 5 (08:00:20), 6 (08:00:25)  
**Sensor Pattern:**  
- Rapid temperature rise from 20 °C to ~58 °C  
- Moderate pressure increase (1  1.5 bar)  
- High vibration spike (30  38 Hz)  
- Material flow constant at 5 units/s  
- Tool advancing from 5 mm  10 mm  
- Energy consumption jumps to 2–3 kWh  

**Rationale:**  
The sharp increase in temperature and high vibration levels are textbook signatures of a cutting or machining operation. Simultaneously, the material flow holds steady at its maximum, indicating raw material is being fed into a cutting tool which is advancing into the workpiece (tool position increment). The energy jump corroborates high-power spindle or laser cutting.

## Phase 3: Assembling Parts (Events 7–8)  
**Events:** 7 (08:00:30), 8 (08:00:35)  
**Sensor Pattern:**  
- Temperature settles around 40 °C  
- Pressure rises to 2 bar (holding/securing clamps)  
- Vibration drops to ~10 Hz  
- Material flow reduced to 2 units/s  
- Tool position steady at 15 mm  
- Energy ~2 kWh  

**Rationale:**  
After cutting, the machine transitions to a lower-intensity phase: the tool is still engaged (tool position at 15 mm) but vibration and flow are reduced. Increased pressure suggests pneumatic clamps or grippers holding parts in place. Moderate energy draw supports servo-driven assembly motions rather than brute-force cutting.

## Phase 4: Welding (Event 9)  
**Events:** 9 (08:00:40)  
**Sensor Pattern:**  
- Temperature spikes to 80 °C  
- Pressure remains at 2 bar  
- Vibration peaks at 50 Hz  
- Material flow drops to 0 units/s  
- Tool position stays at 15 mm  
- Energy peaks at 5 kWh  

**Rationale:**  
A welding cycle commonly induces very high temperatures and energy draw, along with strong vibrational feedback from arc strikes or ultrasonic welding horns. The material feed stops (no flow) because the electrode or welding tip is stationary.

## Phase 5: Post-Weld Cooling (Event 10)  
**Events:** 10 (08:00:45)  
**Sensor Pattern:**  
- Temperature falls quickly to 30 °C  
- Pressure back to 1 bar  
- Vibration nearly zero (1 Hz)  
- Material flow still 0 units/s  
- Tool position remains at weld location  
- Energy drops to 1 kWh  

**Rationale:**  
Immediately after welding, the system enters a cooldown or stabilization sub-phase. The sharp temperature decline, cessation of flow, and minimal vibration reflect passive cooling, while energy consumption remains above pure idle to power cooling fans or monitoring sensors.

## Phase 6: Quality Inspection (Events 11–12)  
**Events:** 11 (08:00:50), 12 (08:00:55)  
**Sensor Pattern:**  
- Temperature ~25 °C (near ambient)  
- Pressure at 1 bar  
- Low vibration (~5 Hz)  
- Slight material flow (1 units/s)  
- Tool position advancing to 20 mm  
- Energy ~1.5 kWh  

**Rationale:**  
A gentle, controlled movement (tool position from 15 mm  20 mm) combined with low vibration and minimal flow suggests a non-destructive scanning or probing operation. The moderate energy draw aligns with small motors driving inspection probes or vision assemblies.  

---

## Phase 7: Idle / Standby (Events 13–15)  
**Events:** 13 (08:01:00), 14 (08:01:05), 15 (08:01:10)  
**Sensor Pattern:**  
- All readings return to baseline (20–21 °C, 1 bar, 0 Hz vibration, 0 flow, 0 tool movement)  
- Energy ~0.4–0.5 kWh  

**Rationale:**  
With the part completed and quality checks done, the machine reverts to idle. The identical conditions to the startup phase confirm that the system is ready for the next cycle.

**Summary of Inferred Process:**  
1. Idle / Initialization  
2. Cutting Metal  
3. Assembling Parts  
4. Welding  
5. Post-Weld Cooling  
6. Quality Inspection  
7. Idle / Standby  

Each phase was delineated by characteristic shifts in temperature, vibration, flow, tool movement, and energy consumption that map intuitively to common manufacturing steps.
