1. Which cases are the slow ones?  
   End-to-end lead time (Submit  Close):

   - 2001: 1 h 30 m  
   - 2002: 26 h 55 m ( 1.1 d)  
   - 2003: 48 h 20 m ( 2.0 d)  
   - 2004: 1 h 25 m  
   - 2005: 100 h 5 m ( 4.2 d)  

   **Performance outliers:** Case 2005 (4 d) and Case 2003 (2 d).  
   The other three cases finish inside two hours.

2. What do the slow cases have in common?

   a) Complexity  
      - Every “High-complexity” case (2003 & 2005) needs  2 “Request Additional Documents” and takes  2 days.  
      - No Low- or Medium-complexity case needs more than one request, and none takes > 1 day.

   b) Resource / adjuster  
      - Adjuster_Mike (region A) and Adjuster_Lisa (region B) are the only ones who ever re-request documents.  
      - Lisa in particular is the adjuster on both of the slowest cases (2002, 2005) and issues 4 of the 7 total document-requests in the log.

   c) Region  
      - Region A: 1 High (slow), 1 Low (fast)  speed driven by complexity, not region.  
      - Region B: 1 High (very slow), 1 Medium (slow), 1 Low (fast)  same pattern.  
       Region itself is not decisive; complexity is.

   d) Document-request pattern  
      - Each extra “Request Additional Documents” adds roughly one extra calendar day (24 h) to the case.  
      - High-complexity claims trigger two or three of these loops; Low/Medium trigger zero or one.

3. Root-cause explanation and what to do about it

   Root cause:  
   “High-complexity” claims are not being clarified the first time the adjuster asks for information.  
   Because the request is generic, customers send partial or incorrect files, which forces the same adjuster to issue a second or third request and wait another business day each cycle.

   Contributing factor:  
   The adjusters with the largest workload (Lisa and Mike) are the same ones who repeatedly re-request documents, suggesting they do not have enough time to specify exactly what is missing the first time.

   Improvement actions:

   1. Introduce a detailed “missing-document checklist” that is sent to the claimant the first time additional documents are requested.  
      – Reduces re-requests and shortens the loop to one iteration for most high-complexity claims.

   2. Set an SLA: “One request only; if second request needed, case is automatically promoted to senior adjuster for phone clarification within 4 h.”  
      – Breaks the multi-day e-mail ping-pong cycle.

   3. Load-balancing: route high-complexity claims to the two senior adjusters (Mike & Lisa) first, but limit each to a maximum of X open high-complexity cases so they can spend the time needed to prepare a complete first request.

   4. Pre-screen channel: for high-complexity products, offer an optional upload session with a customer-service representative at the time the claim is submitted.  
      – Catches missing evidence before the evaluate step, eliminating later loops.

   5. Measure and visualise: create a weekly dashboard that shows average days in “Request Additional Documents” status by complexity and by adjuster; use it to coach adjusters and to validate that the checklist is working.

   If the number of document-request iterations can be capped at one for every claim, the expected lead time of high-complexity cases drops from  4 days to  1 day, aligning them with the medium-complexity benchmark.
