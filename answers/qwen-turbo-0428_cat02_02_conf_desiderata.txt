### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**  
**Case 2** is the only case that violates the strict normative constraints.  

#### **Violations in Case 2:**  
- **Incorrect Order of Activities:**  
  - **Risk Assessment** was performed **before Credit Check** (violates the rule: *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment*).  
  - After the Risk Assessment, **Credit Check** was completed, but this occurred **after** the Risk Assessment, which is still a violation of the required sequence.  
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection:**  
  - **Finalize Documentation** was executed **after a Loan Decision (Rejected)**, which is explicitly prohibited (normative rule: *If rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing*).  

#### **Why These Are Critical:**  
These violations represent **non-compliance with the core process logic**, which could lead to incorrect risk assessments, legal issues, or operational inefficiencies. For example, skipping the Credit Check before Risk Assessment might result in flawed risk evaluations, and finalizing documentation after rejection could cause unnecessary administrative work or confusion.

### **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions**  
**Case 3** fails to meet the recommended best practices (desiderata), though these are not strict violations.  

#### **Desiderata Violations in Case 3:**  
- **Credit Check Delayed Beyond 24 Hours:**  
  - The Credit Check occurred on **2024-01-14 10:00**, **2 days after** the Application Received on **2024-01-12 09:00** (violates the timing recommendation of 24 hours).  
- **Inform Applicant Delayed Beyond 48 Hours:**  
  - The Loan Decision (Approved) was made on **2024-01-14 12:00**, but the Inform Applicant activity occurred on **2024-01-16 15:00**, **more than 48 hours later** (violates the timing recommendation of prompt notification).  
- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  - The process skipped the recommended **Follow-up Call** before closing the case.  

#### **Why These Are Suboptimal:**  
While these deviations do not break the process logic, they may reduce customer satisfaction (e.g., delayed communication) or increase the risk of errors (e.g., outdated documentation). For example, a delayed Credit Check could reflect resource constraints, while a late Inform Applicant step might frustrate the applicant.

### **3. Interpretations/Justifications for Observed Behaviors**  
#### **Case 2:**  
- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:**  
  - Possible justification: A system error or human error (e.g., a staff member mistakenly initiated the Risk Assessment before completing the Credit Check).  
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection:**  
  - Possible justification: A miscommunication or oversight in the approval/rejection workflow (e.g., an automated system failed to block documentation for rejected cases).  

#### **Case 3:**  
- **Delayed Credit Check and Inform Applicant:**  
  - Possible justification: External factors (e.g., third-party data delays, high workload, or unforeseen circumstances). For example, the Credit Check might have required verification from a partner institution, causing a delay.  
- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  - Possible justification: Time constraints or a streamlined process prioritizing efficiency over additional steps.  

#### **General Notes:**  
- **Case 1** adheres strictly to all rules and desiderata, demonstrating an optimal process flow.  
- **Case 2** requires immediate corrective action to align with normative rules (e.g., retraining staff, auditing workflows).  
- **Case 3** could benefit from process improvements to meet desiderata (e.g., setting automated reminders for timely actions, incorporating follow-up calls as a standard step).

### **Summary**  
| Case | Normative Violations | Desiderata Violations |  
|------|----------------------|------------------------|  
| 1    |  None              |  None                |  
| 2    |  Yes (2 violations) |  None                |  
| 3    |  None              |  Yes (3 violations)  |  

By addressing the normative violations in **Case 2** and improving adherence to desiderata in **Case 3**, the organization can ensure compliance, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
