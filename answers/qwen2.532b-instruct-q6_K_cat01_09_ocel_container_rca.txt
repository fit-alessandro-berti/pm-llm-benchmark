Based on the provided directly follows graph (DFG), several potential root causes for performance issues can be identified through a detailed analysis of frequencies, durations, and the nature of events. Here are some specific insights:

### Handling Unit
- **"Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck":** The high frequency but relatively short duration suggests this step is efficiently handled. However, it might indicate potential bottlenecks in upstream processes if goods collection is delayed.

### Truck
- **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck":** High event count (1988) with an exceptionally long duration of 84119.09 suggests significant delays or inefficiencies in reloading trucks after driving to the terminal.
  
### Container
- **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container":** The high frequency and very long duration (368943.92) points to a major delay in acquiring empty containers, which could be due to external factors or inefficiencies in logistics for container procurement.
- **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay":** With an extremely long duration of 743380.51 and a moderate frequency (1794), this step indicates significant delays in moving containers from stock to loading bays, possibly due to insufficient resources or inefficiencies in logistics.
- **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart":** High frequency with an extremely long duration of 1007066.16 suggests that once empty containers are ordered, there is a significant delay before the departure process can start. This might be due to slow processing times or bottlenecks in container handling.

### Vehicle
- **"Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart":** High event count (1956) and long duration (89846.62) indicate that once containers are loaded onto vehicles, there is a significant delay before they depart. This could be due to inefficiencies in the departure process or external factors like traffic.
- **"Book Vehicles" -> "Load to Vehicle":** Long duration (283101.01) suggests that booking and loading processes might not be well-coordinated, leading to extended waiting times.

### Forklift
- The forklift events show relatively high frequencies but some with very long durations, particularly:
  - **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay":** Long duration (743380.51) might reflect inefficiencies or resource constraints during the movement of containers.
  
### Customer Order
- **"Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document":** High frequency with a long duration (329005.22) suggests delays in generating transport documents, potentially due to manual processes or system limitations.

### Transport Document
- **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart":** The extremely high duration (1007066.16) again highlights the significant delay between ordering containers and initiating departures.
  
### General Observations
- High frequency of events with long durations often indicates bottlenecks or inefficiencies in specific steps, particularly in container handling and departure processes.
- Delays at critical points like "Order Empty Containers," "Drive to Terminal," and "Load Truck" after driving indicate key areas where performance can be improved.

By addressing these specific areas, you may significantly improve the overall efficiency of your logistics process.
