## Analysis of Event Log Compliance

### 1. Normative Rule Violations (Serious Issues)

**Case 2 - Multiple Critical Violations:**

1. **Sequence Violation - Risk Assessment before Credit Check**
   - At 08:20, Risk Assessment was performed without a prior Credit Check
   - At 09:00, Credit Check was performed AFTER Risk Assessment
   - **Violation:** Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment (mandatory ordering rule)

2. **Decision Logic Violation - Finalize Documentation after Rejection**
   - At 09:30, Loan was rejected
   - At 10:00, Documentation was finalized despite rejection
   - **Violation:** Documentation should not be finalized after a loan rejection

**Summary:** Case 2 has two serious normative violations that break the strict process rules.

### 2. Desiderata Violations (Non-Critical Issues)

**Case 1:**
-  No desiderata violations
- Credit Check occurred within 30 minutes (well within 24-hour recommendation)
- Applicant informed within 2 hours of decision (within 48-hour recommendation)
- No Follow-up Call recorded (minor desideratum violation)

**Case 2:**
- Beyond the normative violations, Case 2 also:
  -  Had timely Credit Check and notification (though in wrong sequence)
  - No Follow-up Call recorded (minor desideratum violation)

**Case 3:**
- **Credit Check Timing:** Performed on 2024-01-14 (2 days after application on 2024-01-12)
  - Exceeds recommended 24-hour window
- **Inform Applicant Timing:** Performed on 2024-01-16 15:00 (51 hours after decision on 2024-01-14 12:00)
  - Slightly exceeds recommended 48-hour window
- **Missing Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call recorded

**Summary of Desiderata Violations:**
- Cases 1, 2, 3: All missing Follow-up Call (minor issue)
- Case 3: Both timing recommendations exceeded (suboptimal but not critical)

### 3. Interpretations and Recommendations

**Case 1 - Compliant Process:**
This case represents ideal normative behavior with only a minor desideratum gap (missing follow-up call). It can serve as a reference model for proper execution.

**Case 2 - Critical Non-Compliance:**
The violations suggest potential issues:
- **Possible system error:** Risk Assessment might have been triggered prematurely
- **Human error:** Staff may have bypassed required checks
- **Documentation error:** Finalization after rejection could indicate confusion about the decision outcome
- **Recommendation:** Implement system controls to prevent out-of-sequence activities and block documentation finalization after rejections

**Case 3 - Operationally Acceptable but Suboptimal:**
While normatively compliant, the delays suggest:
- **Possible resource constraints:** Weekend/holiday delays (application on Friday, processing on Monday)
- **Workload issues:** Delayed notification might indicate backlog
- **Recommendation:** Review staffing levels and implement automated reminders for time-sensitive activities

### Overall Assessment:
- **Case 1:**  Normatively compliant, minor desiderata gap
- **Case 2:**  Serious normative violations requiring immediate attention
- **Case 3:**  Normatively compliant, but with room for operational improvement

The organization should prioritize fixing the systemic issues that allowed Case 2's violations while also working to improve adherence to desiderata for better overall service quality.
