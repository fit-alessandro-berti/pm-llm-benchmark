### **Justification for Renaming Choices:**

1. **`Verify Documents`**
   - Renamed to **`Initial Document Verification`** (first occurrence) and **`Reverify Documents`** (subsequent occurrences) because:
     - The first instance is the initial check of documents.
     - The second instance occurs after additional documents are submitted or adjustments are made, implying a re-verification step.
   - In **C003**, the first verification is physical (at the branch), so it’s renamed **`Physical Document Verification`** to distinguish it from digital verification in other cases.

2. **`Call Customer`**
   - Renamed to reflect the purpose of the call based on context:
     - **`Call Customer (Missing Docs)`** (C001): Used to request missing documents.
     - **`Call Customer (Clarify Account)`** (C002): Used to resolve a discrepancy.
     - **`Call Customer (Return Request)`** (C003): Used to ask the customer to return to the branch.
   - This makes it clear why the call was made without needing to refer to the context column.

3. **`Approve Request`**
   - Renamed to **`Final Approval`** in all cases because it consistently marks the end of the process. This emphasizes its role as the concluding activity.

4. **`Adjust Account`**
   - Kept unchanged because it always refers to internal corrections, regardless of context. However, if this activity had varying purposes, we could further disambiguate (e.g., "Adjust Account (Discrepancy Fix)").

### **Key Observations:**
- **`Verify Documents`** is context-dependent: initial verification vs. reverification after changes.
- **`Call Customer`** serves different purposes (document request, clarification, return request).
- The **`Resource`** and **`Additional Context`** columns were critical for disambiguating activities (e.g., physical vs. digital verification, purpose of calls).

This renaming ensures that the activity names are self-explanatory and reflect their role in the workflow, reducing ambiguity in process analysis.
