Bias is present in **Group B**, and it is **systemic, traceable, and measurable**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Where the bias occurs
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The +5 “Association Boost” is applied **only** to candidates who belong to the LocalBusinessLeadersClub.  
Membership in that club is **perfectly correlated** with being labelled “LocalResident = TRUE”.  
Thus the adjustment is **not awarded on the basis of job-relevant merit** (skill, personality, or interview performance) but on **group membership** that is already over-represented in Group B.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How the bias manifests in the data
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Metric                     | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected)
--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------
Mean raw Cultural-Fit      | 63.3                | 59.3
Mean **adjusted** C-F      | 63.3                | 64.3
Hire rate                  | 2 / 3 = 66.7 %      | 2 / 3 = 66.7 %
**But** – the two hired cases in B **both** received the +5 boost; **no-one** in A could receive it.
Without the boost, U001 (raw C-F = 60) and U003 (raw C-F = 58) would have been **at or below** the lowest hired candidate in Group A (P003, C-F = 65).  
In other words, **the adjustment changes the hiring outcome for 100 % of the successful cases in Group B and for 0 % of the cases in Group A**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implications for fairness and equity
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Formal equality of opportunity** is violated: identical raw scores do not yield identical chances.  
- **Disparate impact** is introduced: a rule that appears neutral (“add 5 for club membership”) disproportionately benefits the already-privileged group.  
- **Meritocracy signal is corrupted**: Cultural Fit is no longer a pure assessment of alignment with company values; it is partly a proxy for social capital.  
- **Feedback-loop risk**: future cohorts from the protected group will observe that club membership (which they are less likely to have) influences hiring, discouraging applications and reinforcing under-representation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Corrective actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Blind the adjustment**: remove any points that are not validated to predict job performance.  
2. **Validate the club**: if network ties really correlate with performance, model that relationship explicitly and apply the boost **equally to any candidate** who demonstrates equivalent network strength, not just to those in one named organisation.  
3. **Audit continuously**: compare score distributions, pass-rate ratios, and final hiring rates across groups; set thresholds for adverse impact (e.g., < 80 % pass rate of protected vs. unprotected group triggers review).  
4. **Transparency & appeal**: log every adjustment with a documented business rationale and allow candidates to contest scores.

Until these steps are taken, the process remains **biased in favour of the unprotected group**, however unintentional it may be.
