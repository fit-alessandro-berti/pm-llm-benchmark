Here's the updated `declare_model` with bias-mitigating constraints added:

```python
declare_model = {

### **Explanation of Bias Mitigation Constraints:**
1. **Ensuring Key Activities Exist:**
   - `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` are required to exist in all traces, ensuring every application undergoes fairness checks.

2. **Preventing Direct Influence of Sensitive Attributes on Decisions:**
   - **`response` Constraint:** Forces a `BiasMitigationCheck` after `CheckApplicantRace`, ensuring race is not used to make an immediate decision.
   - **`precedence` Constraint:** Ensures `BiasMitigationCheck` happens **before** `FinalDecision`, preventing direct bias.

3. **Enforcing Fairness Through Coexistence:**
   - **Coexistence of `ManualReview` with `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`:** Guarantees that every decision affecting a minority applicant is reviewed.

4. **Preventing Immediate Biased Actions:**
   - **`nonsuccession` Constraint:** Prevents an applicant’s race check (`CheckApplicantRace`) from being directly followed by a final decision (`FinalDecision`).
   - **`nonchainsuccession` Constraint:** Specifically prevents a **direct** transition from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority`, ensuring fairness checks intervene first.

5. **Requiring Bias Mitigation Checks Before Decision Steps:**
   - **`chainprecedence` Constraint:** Ensures that if `CheckApplicantRace` occurs, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must immediately follow.
   - **`chainsuccession` Constraint:** Requires that `BiasMitigationCheck` is immediately followed by `ManualReview`, ensuring fairness checks flow properly.

These constraints help mitigate potential discrimination in the loan application process by requiring fairness checks before making final decisions, enforcing manual review for minority applicants, and preventing direct succession from sensitive attributes to decision outcomes.
