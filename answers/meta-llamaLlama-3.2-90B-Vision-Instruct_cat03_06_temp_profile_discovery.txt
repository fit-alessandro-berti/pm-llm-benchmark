To generate a temporal profile for the given process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities.

We can use the following steps to generate the temporal profile:

1. Parse the given process variants and extract the activities and their corresponding times.
2. Calculate the average time between each pair of activities.
3. Calculate the standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities.
4. Store the results in a dictionary where the keys are the pairs of activities and the values are the average and standard deviation of the times.

Here is a Python code snippet that generates the temporal profile for the given process:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict
import numpy as np
from datetime import timedelta

def generate_temporal_profile(process_variants):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the times between each pair of activities
    times_between_activities = defaultdict(list)

    # Iterate over the process variants
    for variant in process_variants:
        # Extract the activities and their corresponding times
        activities = re.findall(r'->\s*(\w+\s*\w*)', variant)
        times = re.findall(r'performance\s*=\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)', variant)
        times = [float(time) for time in times]

        # Calculate the times between each pair of activities
        for i in range(len(activities) - 1):
            activity1 = activities[i]
            activity2 = activities[i + 1]
            time = times[0] / (len(activities) - 1)
            times_between_activities[(activity1, activity2)].append(time)

    # Initialize a dictionary to store the temporal profile
    temporal_profile = {}

    # Calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities
    for activities, times in times_between_activities.items():
        avg = np.mean(times)
        std_dev = np.std(times)
        temporal_profile[activities] = (avg, std_dev)

    return temporal_profile

# Example usage
process_variants = [
    "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection ( frequency = 56482  performance = 59591524.946 )",
    "Create Fine -> Payment ( frequency = 46371  performance = 889688.400 )",
    # Add the rest of the process variants here...
]

temporal_profile = generate_temporal_profile(process_variants)
