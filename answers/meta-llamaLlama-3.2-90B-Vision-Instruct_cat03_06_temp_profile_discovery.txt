I can provide a Python solution to calculate the temporal profile for the given process.

Please find the solution below:

```python
import collections
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_process_data(data):
    process_data = {}
    for line in data.split('\n'):
        match = re.match(r'Create Fine -> (.*) \( frequency = (\d+)  performance = (\d+\.\d+) \)', line)
        if match:
            sequence, frequency, performance = match.groups()
            sequence = sequence.split(' -> ')
            tokens = [token.split(', ') for token in re.split('(\(.*?\))', sequence[-1])]
            performance_tokens = [float(token[0]) for token in tokens]
            avg_performance = sum(performance_tokens) / len(performance_tokens)
            std_dev = (sum(abs(pi - avg_performance) ** 2 for pi in performance_tokens) / len(performance_tokens)) ** 0.5
            tuples = list(zip(sequence[:-1], sequence[1:]))
            for t in tuples:
                if t not in process_data:
                    process_data[t] = collections.defaultdict(list)
                process_data[t]['performances'].append(performance_tokens[0])
    return process_data

def calculate_temporal_profile(process_data):
    temporal_profile = {}
    for (activity1, activity2), pdata in process_data.items():
        avg = sum(pdata['performances']) / len(pdata['performances'])
        std_dev = (sum(abs(pi - avg) ** 2 for pi in pdata['performances']) / len(pdata['performances'])) ** 0.5
        temporal_profile[(activity1, activity2)] = (avg, std_dev)
    return temporal_profile

data = """... your data..."""
process_data = parse_process_data(data)
temporal_profile = calculate_temporal_profile(process_data)

for (activity1, activity2), (avg, std_dev) in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"({activity1}, {activity2}): (AVG: {avg}, STD DEV: {std_dev})")
```

This code will calculate the temporal profile for the given process. Please replace `"... your data..."` with your actual process data.

This code assumes that the `performance` value in each line represents the time it took to complete the sequence of activities. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the `parse_process_data` function to correctly parse the data.

Additionally, the code assumes that the times are given in seconds. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the `calculate_temporal_profile` function to correctly calculate the average and standard deviation.

Please note that the `temporal_profile` dictionary will contain tuples of activities as keys and tuples of average and standard deviation as values. If you want to use this data in a different format, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.

Finally, you can use the `temporal_profile` dictionary to determine whether a deviation occurs in a process execution by comparing the actual time between two activities with the calculated average and standard deviation.
