Here is a compact Process­Tree that captures exactly the main linear flow, with zero-or-more repetitions of “Request Missing Info  Re-Validate Form” between “Assess Eligibility” and “Approval Decision”:

->(
  “Receive Application”,
  “Validate Form”,
  “Assess Eligibility”,
  *(
    ,
    ->(
      “Request Missing Info”,
      “Validate Form”
    )
  ),
  “Approval Decision”,
  “Send Confirmation”,
  “Archive Case”
)

Explanation of operators:

• ->( … )              : strict sequence of its children  
• *( , ->(RMI, VF) )   : a loop where the first child  is a silent “do-nothing” (so you can immediately exit the loop, yielding zero repetitions), or you perform the second child – a sequence of “Request Missing Info” then “Validate Form” – and then retry the loop again (allowing you to repeat RMIVF any number of times)  
•                      : silent step (no visible activity)  

Thus the only visible traces are:  
RA  VF  AE  (zero or more times [RMI  VF])  AD  SC  AC  

This perfectly fits all three cases in the log:  
– Case 2 does zero loop iterations,  
– Case 1 does one,  
– Case 3 does two.
