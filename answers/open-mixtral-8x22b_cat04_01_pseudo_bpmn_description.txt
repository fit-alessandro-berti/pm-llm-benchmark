The provided pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, which can be either standard or custom. Here's a detailed explanation of each step in the process, along with the purpose of gateways and the conditions that trigger approvals or rework steps.

1. **Start Event**: The process begins when a customer request is received.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**: The request is received, and the process moves forward.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**: This is an exclusive gateway (XOR) that checks whether the received request is a standard request or a custom request.

4. **[If Type = Standard] Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**: If the request is standard, standard validation is performed.

5. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**: This gateway initiates parallel tasks for credit and inventory checks.

6. **Task C1: "Credit Check"** and **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**: These tasks run simultaneously to verify the customer's creditworthiness and the availability of the requested items in inventory, respectively.

7. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**: Once both checks are completed, the process continues.

8. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**: The delivery date is calculated based on the results of the inventory check.

9. **[If Type = Custom] Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**: If the request is custom, a custom feasibility analysis is performed to determine if the request can be fulfilled.

10. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**: This exclusive gateway checks if the customization is feasible.

11. **[If Yes] Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**: If the customization is feasible, a custom quotation is prepared.

12. **[If No] Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**: If the customization is not feasible, a rejection notice is sent to the customer, and the process ends.

13. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**: This exclusive gateway checks if manager approval is required before proceeding with the request.

14. **[If Yes] Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**: If approval is needed, the manager reviews and approves the request.

15. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**: This gateway checks if the manager's approval has been granted.

16. **[If Yes] Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**: If the approval is granted, a final invoice is generated.

17. **[If No] Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**: If approval is not granted, the conditions are re-evaluated.

18. **Loop back to Task E1 (for Custom Path) or Task D (for Standard Path)**: Depending on the request type, the process loops back to the custom quotation or delivery date calculation steps for re-evaluation.

19. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**: Once the final invoice is generated, a confirmation is sent to the customer.

20. **End Event**: The process ends once the customer has been informed.

In summary, this business process handles standard and custom requests with different validation and feasibility checks. It includes parallel credit and inventory checks for standard requests and involves manager approval, if necessary. If the customization is not feasible or approval is not granted, the process loops back to the relevant steps for re-evaluation. The process ends once a confirmation is sent to the customer after generating the final invoice.
