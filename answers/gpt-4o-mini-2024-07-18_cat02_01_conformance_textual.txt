Based on the normative process description provided and the event log, we can identify the following violations in the cases:

### Violation Analysis

#### Case 1: No Violations
- Activities follow the normative process correctly:
  1. Receive order
  2. Check inventory
  3. Authorize payment
  4. Package items
  5. Ship order
  6. Close order

#### Case 2: Violations
- Activities show a violation in sequence:
  1. Receive order
  2. Check inventory
  3. **Package items** (violation occurs here)
  4. **Authorize payment** (also a violation)
  5. Ship order
  6. Close order

**Explanation of Violations:**
- **Packaging before Authorizing Payment:** In the normative process, payment authorization must occur before items can be packaged. Here, packaging happens right after checking inventory, which is incorrect. It violates the rule that ensures items are only packaged after confirming payment authorization.

#### Case 3: Violations
- Activities show violations in sequence:
  1. Receive order
  2. Check inventory
  3. **Authorize payment** (this may be acceptable if inventory is confirmed sufficient, but the next step creates a strong violation)
  4. **Cancel order** (violation occurs here)
  5. **Ship order** (violation continues)
  6. Close order

**Explanation of Violations:**
- **Shipping after Cancellation:** After a cancellation has been processed, it is illogical to proceed with the shipping of the order. Once an order is canceled, the next step should directly be closing the order. Therefore, shipping the order is a clear violation of the normative process.

#### Case 4: No Violations
- Activities follow the normative process correctly:
  1. Receive order
  2. Check inventory
  3. **Cancel order**
  4. Close order

**Explanation of the Correct Flow:**
- This sequence correctly reflects a situation where inventory is not sufficient to fulfill the order, hence leading to cancellation and closure without any conflicts.

#### Case 5: Violations
- Activities show a violation in sequence:
  1. Receive order
  2. Check inventory
  3. **Authorize payment** (this may also be acceptable if inventory is confirmed sufficient, but the next step creates a violation)
  4. **Ship order** (violation occurs here)
  5. Close order

**Explanation of Violations:**
- **Shipping before Packaging:** Here, while payment is authorized correctly, it does not proceed to packaging before shipping. Packaging is an essential step that must come **before** shipping, and this violation disrupts the logical flow of the normative process.

### Summary of Violations
- **Case 2:** Violated the order of "Package items" before "Authorize payment".
- **Case 3:** Violated the sequence by shipping after cancellation.
- **Case 5:** Violated the logical flow by shipping before the required "Package items" step.

### Final Conclusion
The deviations observed highlight the critical nature of adhering to the correct sequence of operations in processing orders. Each case should reflect adherence to the normative process to ensure efficient and logical handling of orders according to inventory statuses.
