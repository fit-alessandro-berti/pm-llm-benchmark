To identify the cases in the event log that deviate from the intended normative process flow, let's analyze each case based on the rules set out in the normative process description.

### Normative Process Rules Recap:
1. **Sequence of Activities When Inventory is Sufficient**: 
   - Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

2. **Sequence of Activities When Inventory is Insufficient**: 
   - Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

3. **Key Constraints**:
   - "Authorize payment" must occur only **after** "Check inventory" and **before** "Package items."
   - "Package items" should occur only **after** payment is authorized and **before** "Ship order."
   - "Ship order" can only occur **after** packaging and **should not** occur after a cancellation.
   - "Close order" must be the final activity in all scenarios.

### Event Log Analysis:

1. **Case 1**:
   - Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close
   - **Status**: No violations.
   - **Explanation**: Follows the normative process correctly.

2. **Case 2**:
   - Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Package -> Authorize -> Ship -> Close
   - **Status**: Violates the normative process.
   - **Violation**: Payment authorization occurs after packaging. According to the rules, "Authorize payment" should occur after "Check inventory" and **before** "Package items."

3. **Case 3**:
   - Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Cancel -> Ship -> Close
   - **Status**: Violates the normative process.
   - **Violation**: Shipping occurs after cancellation. Once an order is canceled, the correct flow should be to directly close the order, not to package or ship.

4. **Case 4**:
   - Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close
   - **Status**: No violations.
   - **Explanation**: Follows the normative process correctly for insufficient inventory.

5. **Case 5**:
   - Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Ship -> Close
   - **Status**: Violates the normative process.
   - **Violation**: "Ship order" occurs without "Package items." According to the rules, items must be packaged before they can be shipped.

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2**: Payment authorization after packaging violates the required sequence.
- **Case 3**: Shipping after cancellation violates the required flow and logical process.
- **Case 5**: Shipping without prior packaging violates the required sequence.
  
### Final Assessment:
The cases that violate the normative process are **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**. Each of these cases deviates from the defined expected sequences due to improper handling of activities concerning payment, shipment, and order cancellation.
