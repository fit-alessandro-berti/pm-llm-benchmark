## Step 1: Identifying High-Level Steps
After examining the sequence of events for each case, we can identify several logical groupings of low-level steps. These high-level activities represent distinct phases of the manufacturing process.

## Step 2: Grouping Events
Based on the event log, the following high-level activities can be identified:

1. **Material Preparation**: This step includes retrieving the raw metal sheet, scanning the barcode, placing it on the table, aligning, and preheating.
   - Justification: These events are all related to preparing the raw material for the next stage of the process. They occur at the beginning of the process and are performed by the same resource type (Operator A and Robot Arm #2).

2. **Assembly**: This step includes picking up the welding tool, welding corner A, welding corner B, and measuring weld integrity.
   - Justification: These events are all part of the assembly process, where the metal sheet is transformed into a product. They are performed by the same resource type (Operator B and Quality Sensor #1) and are logically connected.

3. **Surface Treatment**: This step includes applying protective coating and drying the coating.
   - Justification: These events are related to treating the surface of the product after assembly. They are performed by different resources (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2) but are logically connected.

4. **Quality Check**: This step includes the visual check performed by Operator C.
   - Justification: This event is a quality assurance check that occurs at the end of the process. It is performed by a different resource type (Operator C) and is logically separate from the other steps.

## Step 3: Naming the High-Level Activities
The proposed names for the high-level activities are already provided in the previous step.

## Step 4: Output Format
The structured representation of the proposed high-level activities is as follows:

- **Material Preparation**:
    - Retrieve raw metal sheet
    - Scan barcode
    - Place metal sheet on table
    - Align metal sheet
    - Preheat metal sheet

- **Assembly**:
    - Pick up welding tool
    - Weld corner A
    - Weld corner B
    - Measure weld integrity

- **Surface Treatment**:
    - Apply protective coating
    - Dry coating

- **Quality Check**:
    - Visual check

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$
