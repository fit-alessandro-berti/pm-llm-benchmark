### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - Average time ~25 hours with a very low standard deviation (1 hour)  
   - Suggests an unusually rigid, almost clockwork timing for approval, which is suspicious given natural process variability.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - Very long average delay (7 days) and large standard deviation (2 days)  
   - Indicates possible irregularities such as notification backlogs or inconsistent handling of the notification step.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**  
   - Quick closing time (2 hours on average) relative to other steps  
   - May indicate that some claims are closed prematurely, skipping evaluation or approval steps.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - Very short average interval (5 minutes)  
   - Could be too rapid for a realistic notification step, possibly indicating skipped checks or immediate automated notifications.

### Hypotheses for the Anomalies

- **Rigid R-to-P Timing:** Possibly due to scheduled batch processing or system-enforced delays that cause approvals to happen around fixed times. Another possibility is artificially set timeouts or system timers forcing approvals after a fixed delay.

- **Long and Variable P-to-N Delays:** Could stem from resource constraints such as personnel availability for notifications, manual notification processes causing backlogs, or prioritization differences for notifications in different regions or claim types.

- **Premature Closures (A-to-C):** Some claims might bypass proper evaluation or approval due to emergency closures, automated rejections, or system errors marking claims as closed immediately after assignment.

- **Very Fast E-to-N Transition:** This may indicate automated notifications triggered immediately upon evaluation completion without manual review, or skipping of expected intermediate steps such as approval or a waiting period.

### Proposed SQL Verification Queries

1. **Detect claims with abnormal R to P time intervals outside expected range (e.g., beyond 3 standard deviations):**

```sql
WITH events AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS receive_time,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
r_to_p_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) AS r_p_seconds
  FROM events
  WHERE receive_time IS NOT NULL AND approve_time IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *
FROM r_to_p_times
WHERE r_p_seconds NOT BETWEEN (90000 - 3 * 3600) AND (90000 + 3 * 3600)
ORDER BY r_p_seconds;
```

---

2. **Find claims where P to N delay is unusually long or short (beyond 3 standard deviations):**

```sql
WITH events AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
p_to_n_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) AS p_n_seconds
  FROM events
  WHERE approve_time IS NOT NULL AND notify_time IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *
FROM p_to_n_times
WHERE p_n_seconds NOT BETWEEN (604800 - 3 * 172800) AND (604800 + 3 * 172800)
ORDER BY p_n_seconds DESC;
```

---

3. **Identify claims closed very soon after assign (A to C  2 hours) indicating potential premature closure:**

```sql
WITH events AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_time,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       assign_time,
       close_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) / 3600 AS hours_to_close
FROM events
WHERE assign_time IS NOT NULL 
  AND close_time IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) <= 7200
ORDER BY hours_to_close;
```

---

4. **Check for claims that skip evaluation or approval before closure (A to C with no E or P events):**

```sql
WITH assign_close AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_time,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
eval_approve AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS eval_count,
         COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS approve_count
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT ac.claim_id, assign_time, close_time, eval_count, approve_count
FROM assign_close ac
JOIN eval_approve ea ON ac.claim_id = ea.claim_id
WHERE assign_time IS NOT NULL
  AND close_time IS NOT NULL
  AND eval_count = 0
  AND approve_count = 0
ORDER BY close_time - assign_time;
```

---

5. **Correlate anomalies with claim types or adjusters involved to find patterns:**

```sql
-- Example: Get average P to N time by claim type
WITH events AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time
  FROM claim_events ce
  GROUP BY ce.claim_id
),
p_to_n_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) AS p_n_seconds
  FROM events
  WHERE approve_time IS NOT NULL AND notify_time IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT c.claim_type,
       AVG(pn.p_n_seconds) AS avg_p_to_n_seconds,
       STDDEV(pn.p_n_seconds) AS stdev_p_to_n_seconds,
       COUNT(*) AS num_claims
FROM p_to_n_times pn
JOIN claims c ON pn.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY avg_p_to_n_seconds DESC;
```

---

6. **Analyze whether particular adjusters or regions have more timing anomalies (e.g., delayed notifications):**

```sql
WITH events AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time
  FROM claim_events ce
  GROUP BY ce.claim_id
),
p_to_n_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) AS p_n_seconds
  FROM events
  WHERE approve_time IS NOT NULL AND notify_time IS NOT NULL
),
claims_with_adjusters AS (
  SELECT c.claim_id, c.customer_id, a.adjuster_id, a.region
  FROM claims c
  JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
  JOIN adjusters a ON cast(ce.resource AS INTEGER) = a.adjuster_id
)
SELECT cwa.region,
       AVG(pn.p_n_seconds) AS avg_p_to_n_seconds,
       COUNT(*) AS claim_count
FROM p_to_n_times pn
JOIN claims_with_adjusters cwa ON pn.claim_id = cwa.claim_id
GROUP BY cwa.region
ORDER BY avg_p_to_n_seconds DESC;
```

These queries help surface claims and groups exhibiting abnormal timing behavior, allowing investigation of root causes such as system issues, resource limitations, or process deviations.
