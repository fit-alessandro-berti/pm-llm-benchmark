Based on the BPMN 2.0 XML model you provided, it appears to be a simple workflow process with several tasks annotated as "Task". Unfortunately, without knowing more about the specific tasks and their roles within the project, I cannot provide you with a list of all the tasks.

However, if you'd like me to extract the actual task names and details from your BPMN 2.0 model into plain text or provide steps on how to extract them (as per your request), I'll be more than happy to assist.
