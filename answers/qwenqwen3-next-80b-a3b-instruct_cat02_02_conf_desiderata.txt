Here is a detailed analysis of the event log based on the **Normative Process Behavior (strict rules)** and the **Desiderata (recommended practices)**.

---

### **1. Identification of Normative Rule Violations**

Normative rules are **strict** — any deviation constitutes a **serious violation** of the process model.

#### **Case 2: Violates Multiple Normative Rules**

| Activity | Timestamp | Violation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Risk Assessment | 2024-01-11 08:20 |  **Before Credit Check** — violates "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment" |
| Credit Check | 2024-01-11 09:00 |  Performed *after* Risk Assessment — confirms reversal of required sequence |
| Finalize Documentation | 2024-01-11 10:00 |  **Performed after Loan Decision (Rejected)** — violates "Do not finalize documentation after rejection" |

**Summary of Normative Violations in Case 2:**
- **Order Violation 1:** Risk Assessment before Credit Check  **Invalid sequence**
- **Order Violation 2:** Credit Check performed after Risk Assessment  **Reversed dependency**
- **Contradictory Action:** Finalize Documentation after Rejection  **Prohibited action**

>  **Conclusion:** **Case 2 is a clear and serious violation of the normative process model.** It breaks three core constraints: activity ordering and a forbidden action. This case is **not compliant** and should be flagged for audit or process correction.

---

#### **Case 1: Fully Compliant with Normative Rules**

| Activity | Timestamp | Compliance |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Application Received | 2024-01-10 09:00 |  Start |
| Credit Check | 2024-01-10 09:30 |  After Application |
| Risk Assessment | 2024-01-10 10:00 |  After Credit Check |
| Loan Decision (Approved) | 2024-01-10 11:00 |  After Risk Assessment |
| Inform Applicant | 2024-01-10 13:00 |  After Loan Decision |
| Finalize Documentation | 2024-01-10 13:30 |  After Approval, before Close Case |
| Close Case | 2024-01-10 14:00 |  After Finalize Documentation |

>  **Conclusion:** **Case 1 fully adheres to all normative constraints.** No violations. Ideal behavior.

---

#### **Case 3: Fully Compliant with Normative Rules**

| Activity | Timestamp | Compliance |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Application Received | 2024-01-12 09:00 |  Start |
| Credit Check | 2024-01-14 10:00 |  After Application (timing aside) |
| Risk Assessment | 2024-01-14 11:00 |  After Credit Check |
| Loan Decision (Approved) | 2024-01-14 12:00 |  After Risk Assessment |
| Inform Applicant | 2024-01-16 15:00 |  After Loan Decision |
| Finalize Documentation | 2024-01-17 09:00 |  After Approval, before Close Case |
| Close Case | 2024-01-17 10:00 |  After Finalize Documentation |

>  **Conclusion:** **Case 3 fully complies with all normative rules.** All activities occur in the correct order, and documentation was finalized only after approval and before closing. **No normative violations.**

---

### **2. Identification of Desiderata Violations**

Desiderata are **recommended but not mandatory**. Violations indicate suboptimal performance but are not process model breaches.

#### **Case 3: Violates Two Desiderata**

| Desideratum | Observation | Violation? |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received** | Applied: 2024-01-12 09:00  Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00  **49 hours later** |  **Yes** — exceeds 24-hour recommendation |
| **Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision** | Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00  Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00  **51 hours later** |  **Yes** — exceeds 48-hour recommendation |
| **Follow-up Call before closing** | Not recorded at all |  **Yes** — missing, though not required |

>  **Conclusion:** Case 3 exhibits **three desiderata violations**:
- Delayed credit check (>24h)
- Delayed applicant notification (>48h)
- No follow-up call

These are **not process violations**, but they indicate **poor service quality, potential customer dissatisfaction, or internal inefficiencies**. These should be monitored for process improvement, but do not invalidate the case.

#### **Case 1: Meets Desiderata (Implicitly)**

| Desideratum | Observation | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Credit Check after Application | 0.5 hours later  well within 24h |  Met |
| Inform Applicant after Decision | 2 hours later  well within 48h |  Met |
| Follow-up Call | Not recorded |  Unknown — absence does not imply violation (not mandatory) |

>  **Conclusion:** Case 1 **meets all timing desiderata**. The absence of a follow-up call is not a violation — it's optional.

#### **Case 2: Violates One Desideratum (Timing)**

| Desideratum | Observation | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Credit Check within 24h | Applied: 2024-01-11 08:00  Credit Check: 2024-01-11 09:00  1 hour later |  Met |
| Inform Applicant after Decision | Decision: 09:30  Inform: 10:00  30 min later |  Met |
| Follow-up Call | Not recorded |  Unknown — optional |

>  **Conclusion:** Case 2 **meets the timing desiderata**, but **violates normative rules** — so desiderata compliance is irrelevant here due to prior serious violations.

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**

#### **Case 2: Why might this happen?**
- **Possible Cause:** System error or manual data entry mistake — perhaps the Credit Check was logged *after* it was performed (e.g., delayed logging), or Risk Assessment was triggered incorrectly by an automated rule.
- **Justification Attempt:** One could argue the Credit Check was initiated earlier (e.g., automatically triggered at application) but logged late. However, **the log is the record of observed events** — and as per the log, Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check. In a process audit context, **the log is truth**. Therefore, no justification can override the observed sequence.
- **Risk:** This case could indicate **fraudulent behavior** (e.g., bypassing credit check) or **systemic breakdown** in process control. **Must be investigated.**

#### **Case 3: Why the delays?**
- **Possible Cause:** High workload, weekend delays (e.g., application received Friday, credit check Monday), or resource constraints.
- **Justification:** The process still followed the correct order. Delays may reflect **operational bottlenecks**, not process model failure. The fact that Finalize Documentation and Close Case occurred in correct order shows intent to comply.
- **Recommendation:** Implement SLA alerts or automated reminders to trigger overdue activities. Consider adding a "Pending" state for delayed steps to improve visibility.

#### **Missing Follow-up Call (Cases 2 & 3)**
- **Interpretation:** Follow-up call is optional. Absence may mean:
  - The applicant was easily reachable via email/SMS (Inform Applicant sufficed).
  - The case was straightforward (e.g., approved loan with no ambiguities).
  - Staff were overburdened.
- **Recommendation:** Track whether follow-up calls correlate with higher satisfaction or lower appeal rates. If data shows benefit, consider making it semi-mandatory.

###  **Final Summary**

| Case ID | Normative Compliance | Normative Violations | Desiderata Violations | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **1** |  Fully Compliant | None | None | **Ideal case** — follows all rules and timing. |
| **2** |  **Severe Violation** | 1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check<br>2. Finalize Documentation after Rejection | None | **Critical issue** — process integrity breached. Must be investigated. |
| **3** |  Fully Compliant | None | 1. Credit Check >24h<br>2. Inform Applicant >48h<br>3. No Follow-up Call | **Suboptimal but compliant** — delays suggest inefficiency, not rule-breaking. Monitor for improvement. |

###  Recommendations

1. **For Case 2:**  
   - Trigger an **audit alert**.  
   - Review system logs or user actions to determine if this was a system bug, human error, or intentional bypass.  
   - Consider implementing **enforcement rules** (e.g., system blocks Risk Assessment unless Credit Check is completed).

2. **For Case 3:**  
   - Analyze root causes of delays (e.g., staffing, workload, system latency).  
   - Consider **automated SLA tracking** and notifications to prompt timely actions.  
   - Evaluate whether **Follow-up Call** should be made mandatory for approved loans to improve customer experience.

3. **General Improvement:**  
   - Integrate **process mining tools** to automatically flag normative violations in real time.  
   - Separate **compliance reporting** (normative) from **performance dashboards** (desiderata) for clearer management insight.

---

**Final Verdict:**  
Only **Case 2** violates normative rules — it is **non-compliant** and requires immediate attention.  
Cases 1 and 3 are **normatively compliant**; Case 3 only suffers from **performance delays** (desiderata), which are actionable but not critical.
