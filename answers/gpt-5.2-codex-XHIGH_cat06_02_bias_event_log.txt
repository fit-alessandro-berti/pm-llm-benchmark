**Where bias shows up**

- **PreliminaryScoring explicitly adds “+10 (Community)”** for members of the *Highland Civic Darts Club* (C001, C004).  
  That adjustment is **not** based on creditworthiness and is only granted to a specific community affiliation.

- **ManualReview and FinalDecision preserve that boost**, meaning the adjustment directly influences approvals.

**Evidence of disparate impact**

- **C004** had a **base score of 690** but was **approved at 700** after the community boost.  
- **C003**, with a **higher base score of 715**, was **rejected** because it lacked the community affiliation and was a nonlocal resident.  

This implies the *effective approval threshold* is lower for members of the favored group, and higher for those without it.

**Attributes driving the bias**

- **CommunityGroup (Highland Civic Darts Club)**  explicit score boost  
- **LocalResident status**  appears correlated with access to the group and outcomes

**Fairness implications**

- Applicants **without the club affiliation or local residency** must be **more creditworthy** to achieve the same decision.  
- The process **advantages a geographically or socially narrow group** and disadvantages outsiders or nonmembers, even when their underlying credit risk is equal or better.  
- This is a classic **proxy discrimination problem**: a nonfinancial attribute is being used to systematically tilt outcomes.

**Bottom line:**  
The bias originates in the **communitybased score adjustment**, which privileges a specific local group and creates unequal approval standards for otherwise similar applicants.
