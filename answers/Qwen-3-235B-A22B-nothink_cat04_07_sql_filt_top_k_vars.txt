Here's a complete **DuckDB SQL query** that fulfills your benchmark requirements. This version assumes you define a variable `K` to limit the number of top variants you want to include. Since DuckDB doesn't support variables in pure SQL, you can either substitute `K` manually or use a scalar parameter in a prepared statement or script.

###  **Step-by-step Breakdown in SQL:**

```sql
-- Step 1: Extract ordered sequence of activities per case
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS variant
    FROM event_log
),

-- Step 2: Group by variant and count frequency
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id, variant
        FROM ordered_activities
    ) AS unique_case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),

-- Step 3: Get the top K variants by frequency
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY frequency DESC
    LIMIT K  -- Replace K with the desired number, e.g., LIMIT 5
),

-- Step 4: Get all cases that belong to these top K variants
top_k_cases AS (
    SELECT
        oa.case_id
    FROM
        ordered_activities oa
    INNER JOIN
        top_k_variants tkv
        ON oa.variant = tkv.variant
    GROUP BY oa.case_id
)

-- Step 5: Return all events from the original log that belong to these cases
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_k_cases);
```

###  Explanation:

1. **`ordered_activities` CTE**:
   - For each `case_id`, we use a **window function** to build an array of activities ordered by `timestamp`.
   - `ARRAY_AGG(... ORDER BY timestamp)` ensures the correct sequence.

2. **`variant_counts` CTE**:
   - Counts how many distinct `case_id`s correspond to each unique variant (sequence of activities).

3. **`top_k_variants` CTE**:
   - Selects the top `K` most frequent variants.

4. **`top_k_cases` CTE**:
   - Gets the `case_id`s that correspond to the top K variants.

5. **Final SELECT**:
   - Returns all events from the original event log that belong to the cases in the top K variants.

###  Example with `K = 5`:

Replace `LIMIT K` with `LIMIT 5` if you want the top 5 variants.

```sql
LIMIT 5
```

###  Notes:

- DuckDB supports `ARRAY_AGG(... ORDER BY ...)`, which is critical for building sequences.
- You can materialize the variant as a string (e.g., `'A > B > C'`) if desired using `ARRAY_TO_STRING(variant, ' > ')`.
- This query assumes that `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` are the exact column names.

Let me know if you want a version that returns variant strings instead of arrays or integrates with Python (e.g., using `duckdb` in a Jupyter notebook).
