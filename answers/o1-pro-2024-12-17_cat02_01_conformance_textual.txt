**Step-by-Step Reasoning**

First, let’s restate the normative process rules from the description:

1. The process always starts with "Receive order."
2. After receiving the order, the next step must be "Check inventory."
3. If inventory is sufficient:
   - The sequence should be: **Receive → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order.**
   
4. If inventory is insufficient:
   - The sequence should be: **Receive → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order.**
   
5. Key constraints:
   - "Authorize payment" must occur **after** "Check inventory" and **before** "Package items."
   - "Package items" must occur **after** "Authorize payment" and **before** "Ship order."
   - "Ship order" must never occur after a cancellation and should only occur after packaging (in the sufficient-inventory scenario).
   - "Close order" should always be the final activity, regardless of scenario.

**Check Each Case Against These Rules**

**Case 1:**
- Events:  
  Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order
- Analysis: This perfectly matches the sufficient-inventory scenario. There is no violation.
- Conclusion: **No violation.**

**Case 2:**
- Events:  
  Receive order → Check inventory → Package items → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order
- Analysis:
  - After checking the inventory, they package items **before** authorizing payment.
  - The normative flow requires "Authorize payment" before "Package items."
- Specific Rule Violated: "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment," which breaks the required order.
- Conclusion: **Violation identified (sequence order is incorrect).**

**Case 3:**
- Events:  
  Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Cancel order → Ship order → Close order
- Analysis:
  - They authorized payment and then canceled the order. While this is unusual, the bigger issue is what follows.
  - Once an order is canceled, the proper sequence in an insufficient-inventory scenario should be to close the order directly. There should be no packaging or shipping after cancellation.
  - Here, "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
- Specific Rule Violated: "Ship order" took place after a cancellation, which is not allowed.
- Conclusion: **Violation identified (shipping after cancellation).**

**Case 4:**
- Events:  
  Receive order → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order
- Analysis:
  - This sequence matches the insufficient-inventory scenario perfectly.
  - No payment authorization, no packaging, no shipping—just a straightforward cancellation.
- Conclusion: **No violation.**

**Case 5:**
- Events:  
  Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order
- Analysis:
  - In the sufficient-inventory scenario, after authorizing payment, the next step should be to "Package items" before "Ship order."
  - The "Package items" step is missing here.
- Specific Rule Violated: The sequence skipped "Package items" before "Ship order."
- Conclusion: **Violation identified (missing the packaging step before shipping).**

**Summary of Violations:**

- **Case 1:** No violation.
- **Case 2:** Violation (packaging before payment authorization).
- **Case 3:** Violation (shipping after cancellation).
- **Case 4:** No violation.
- **Case 5:** Violation (shipping without prior packaging).

**Final Answer:**

Cases **2**, **3**, and **5** violate the normative process. The violations are as follows:

- **Case 2:** "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment," contradicting the required order.
- **Case 3:** "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order," which is never allowed.
- **Case 5:** "Ship order" was performed without the preceding "Package items" step, violating the expected sequence.
