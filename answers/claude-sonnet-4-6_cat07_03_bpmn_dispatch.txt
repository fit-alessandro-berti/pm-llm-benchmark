# Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Diagram Description

## Overview
This is a **BPMN diagram** depicting the **"Dispatch of Goods"** process for a **Computer Hardware Shop**, organized across three swim lanes.

---

## Swim Lanes (Participants)

### 1.  **Logistics** (Top Lane)
- Contains one task: **"Insure Parcel"**
- Triggered when insurance is deemed necessary

### 2.  **Secretary** (Middle Lane)
- Handles the core decision-making and administrative tasks

### 3.  **Warehouse** (Bottom Lane)
- Handles physical packaging and shipment preparation

---

## Process Flow

### **Start**
- **Start Event:** "Ship Goods" triggers the process
- Flows into a **parallel gateway (+)** splitting into two concurrent paths

### **Secretary Path**
1. **"Clarify Shipment Method"** (references *Order Details* document)
2. **Exclusive Gateway (X):** *Special Handling?*
   - **Yes ** "Get 3 offers from logistic companies"  "Select logistic company and place order"
   - **No ** "Check if Insurance is Required" (uses *Customer Information* database)
     - **If insurance necessary ** "Insure Parcel" *(Logistics lane)*
     - **Always ** "Write Package Label"
   - Both paths merge at an **exclusive gateway**

### **Warehouse Path**
1. **"Package Goods"**
   -  **48-hour timer event**  triggers **"Notify Customer About Delay"**
2. Merges back via intermediate event

### **Convergence**
- All paths merge at a **parallel gateway (+)**
-  **"Fill Out Shipment Paperwork"**
-  **"Move Package to Pickup Area"**
- **End Event:** "Shipment Prepared"
