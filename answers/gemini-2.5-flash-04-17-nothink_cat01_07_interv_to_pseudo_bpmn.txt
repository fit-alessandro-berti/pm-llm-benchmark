// DataObject: Accounting System Log
// DataObject: Receipt Confirmation
// DataObject: Approved Invoice Status
// DataObject: Discrepancy Details

// Roles/Participants:
// Role: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
// Role: Purchasing Officer (Dan)
// Role: Department Manager (Carlos)
// Role: Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
// Role: Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
// Role: Supplier
// System: Accounting System

// Notes/Ambiguities:
// - The specific process for handling rejected invoices after manager review or escalation is not fully detailed. It's assumed they return to a state where they can potentially be approved if issues are resolved.
// - The role of the Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is primarily focused on resolving discrepancies or missing information with the supplier, acting as a support role rather than a core process participant with direct approval/rejection power in the system.
// - The exact trigger for escalating to the Supervisor (Rita) after a discrepancy is not always clear; it seems to happen when initial clarification attempts fail.
// - The process for handling invoices without a PO seems to involve Rita early on, diverting from the main flow described by Mary initially.
