This is a business process diagram (BPMN) showing a shipping and logistics workflow divided into three swim lanes representing different organizational roles:

## **Logistics (Top Lane)**
Contains a single activity: "Insure parcel" which receives input from the Secretary lane below.

## **Secretary (Middle Lane)**
This is the main process flow lane containing:
- **Start event**: "Ship goods"
- **First decision gateway**: "Clarify shipment method" which branches based on whether special handling is needed
- If NO special handling: flows to "Check if insurance is required" (with Customer Information database input)
- A parallel gateway that always executes "Write package label"
- If YES special handling: flows to "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" then "Select logistic company and place order"
- Both paths converge at a final joining gateway

## **Warehouse (Bottom Lane)**
Contains the final packaging and shipping steps:
- "Package goods" activity (with a 48-hour timer)
- "Notify customer about delay" (connected to the timer)
- A merging gateway that combines flows
- "Fill out Shipment paperwork" activity
- Final activity: "Move package to pickup area"
- **End event**: "Shipment prepared"

The diagram shows a complete order fulfillment process from initial shipping request through packaging and final preparation for pickup, with decision points for handling method, insurance requirements, and logistics provider selection.
