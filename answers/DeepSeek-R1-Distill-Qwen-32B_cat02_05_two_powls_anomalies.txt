Okay, so I've got this task where I need to analyze two POWL models of the Hire-to-Retire process. I'm a bit new to POWL models, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to recall what the standard Hire-to-Retire process entails. From what I remember, it's a sequence of activities like posting a job ad, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding, adding to payroll, and closing the case. The standard order is pretty linear: you post the ad, then screen candidates, then interviews, then decide, onboard, add to payroll, and close.

Now, looking at Model 1. The activities are Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close. Let me see the order:

- Post  Screen
- Screen  Decide
- Screen  Interview
- Decide  Onboard
- Onboard  Payroll
- Payroll  Close

Wait, so after Screen, both Decide and Interview are next. That seems off because typically, interviews happen before the hiring decision. If Screen leads to both, that would mean that you can either screen and decide or screen and interview, but the decision should come after the interview. So in Model 1, the flow after Screen is to both Decide and Interview. That might mean that the hiring decision is made before conducting interviews, which doesn't make sense. That's probably an anomaly.

Also, looking at the order, after Decide comes Onboard, which is correct. Then Onboard to Payroll, which is correct, and Payroll to Close, which is correct. So the main issue is the order after Screen. So Model 1 has an anomaly where the Interview isn't required before the Decision.

Now, looking at Model 2. The nodes are Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close. Let me visualize the order:

- Post  Screen
- Post  Interview
- Interview  Decide
- Decide  loop_onboarding
- loop_onboarding  xor_payroll
- xor_payroll  Close

Wait, so from Post, both Screen and Interview are next. That seems strange because you can't screen candidates if you haven't posted the ad yet, so that makes sense. But also, from Post, it goes directly to Interview? That doesn't make sense because you need to screen candidates before conducting interviews. So in Model 2, after Posting, you can go to Screen or Interview. That's a problem because Interview should come after Screen.

Additionally, loop_onboarding is a loop operator containing Onboard and skip. That means Onboarding can be repeated, but that doesn't make much sense in this context. Once you onboard an employee, you don't loop back to onboard again. So having a loop on Onboard is an anomaly because it allows for repetition where it shouldn't be.

Then, xor_payroll is an XOR choice between Payroll and skip. So after loop_onboarding, it can either add to Payroll or skip. That's another issue because adding to Payroll is a mandatory step after Onboarding. So skipping it would be an anomaly, as it's a critical step.

So summarizing:

Model 1's anomaly: After Screen, both Decide and Interview are next, which incorrectly allows the decision to be made before the interview.

Model 2 has two anomalies: 
1. From Post, you can go to Interview without screening, which is wrong.
2. A loop on Onboarding, which allows repeating Onboarding, which isn't necessary.
3. An XOR choice that allows skipping Payroll, which is a critical step.

Comparing the two, Model 1's main issue is the incorrect sequence after Screen, but the rest of the flow seems correct except for that. Model 2 has more severe issues, like allowing interviews before screening and introducing loops and choices that shouldn't be there. 

Therefore, Model 1 is closer to the normative process despite having a significant anomaly, whereas Model 2 has more severe deviations that affect the process's integrity more drastically.

**Answer:**

The analysis of the two POWL models reveals that Model 1 more closely aligns with the standard Hire-to-Retire process despite having anomalies. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Model 1 Analysis
- **Anomaly:** The sequence allows "Make_Hiring_Decision" directly after "Screen_Candidates" without requiring "Conduct_Interviews." This is incorrect as hiring decisions typically follow interviews.
- **Impact:** While the order after screening is flawed, the rest of the process (onboarding, payroll, closure) follows the standard sequence, making this anomaly less severe.

### Model 2 Analysis
- **Anomaly 1:** Directly proceeding from "Post_Job_Ad" to "Conduct_Interviews" without screening candidates first. This is a critical deviation.
- **Anomaly 2:** A loop structure around "Onboard_Employee," allowing unnecessary repetition.
- **Anomaly 3:** An XOR choice that skips adding the employee to payroll, omitting a crucial step.
- **Impact:** These anomalies introduce significant deviations, affecting process integrity more severely than Model 1's issues.

### Conclusion
Model 1, despite the sequence issue after screening, maintains the correct order for critical steps post-decision. Model 2 introduces more severe deviations, including missing steps and unnecessary loops, which compromise the process's correctness more fundamentally. Therefore, Model 1 is closer to the normative process.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{1}
