**Justifications for Naming Changes:**

*   **C001 (Initiate Request):**  This activity is consistently used in both cases.  The renaming to "Initiate Request" clearly indicates the initial step in the process.
*   **C002 (Initiate Request):**  This activity is repeated in both cases, representing the start of the customer support journey.  The renaming to "Initiate Request" highlights its role as the starting point.
*   **C003 (Verify Documents):**  This activity appears in both cases, signifying the verification process. The renaming to "Verify Documents" explicitly states its purpose.
*   **C004 (Verify Documents):**  This activity is repeated in both cases, indicating the verification step. The renaming to "Verify Documents" clarifies its function.
*   **C005 (Initiate Request):**  This activity is used in both cases, representing the beginning of the support ticket. The renaming to "Initiate Request" emphasizes its role as the initial action.
*   **C006 (Initiate Request):**  This activity is repeated in both cases, representing the start of the support ticket. The renaming to "Initiate Request" highlights its role as the starting point.

**Overall Strategy:**

The goal was to move beyond simply listing the activities and instead, to provide context and meaning to each event.  By renaming activities based on their function within the overall support workflow, we created a more understandable and actionable log.  The justifications explain *why* the changes were made, linking the new names to the process flow.
