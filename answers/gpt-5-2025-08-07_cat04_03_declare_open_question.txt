High-level intent
- The activities read like a tightly controlled retail-lending lifecycle: take in an application, check credit exactly once, collect supporting documents, iterate with QA until the file is clean, assemble the offer, formally authorize it, disburse funds, and keep the customer informed. The constraints try to enforce compliance (no “Z”), quality gates (QA before authorization), and a clear, auditable order of work (init, precedence/succession/chain rules).

What each constraint means in practical terms
- existence
  - Receive_Application: every loan case must start with an actual customer application on file (audit trail, consent, “permissible purpose”).
  - Gather_Additional_Documents: every case collects supporting evidence at least once (KYC/AML, income verification, ability-to-repay).
- absence
  - Proceed_Without_Compliance: a hard prohibition on bypassing mandated controls (prevents unlawful disbursements).
- exactly_one
  - Preliminary_Credit_Check: pull credit once per case to comply with FCRA/consent and to avoid score impacts and duplicate bureau costs.
- init
  - Receive_Application: the very first loggable action must be the application (prevents any work without a customer’s request/consent).
- responded_existence
  - Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package -> Quality_Assurance_Review: if a package is prepared, QA must exist in the case, ensuring oversight before any externalization.
- coexistence
  - Gather_Additional_Documents <-> Authorize_Contract_Terms (coexistence is symmetric): no authorization unless docs exist; and if docs are gathered, the case is expected to reach an authorization decision (accept/decline).
- response
  - Receive_Application -> Preliminary_Credit_Check: an application triggers the credit assessment step (risk gating up front).
- precedence
  - Quality_Assurance_Review -> Authorize_Contract_Terms: authorization can happen only after QA (foureyes control, maker–checker).
- succession
  - Preliminary_Credit_Check -> Gather_Additional_Documents: after the credit pull, the case proceeds to document collection; and document collection can’t happen before the check (enforces risk-first sequencing).
- altresponse
  - Transfer_Funds -> Notify_Customer: after each disbursement, notify the customer before any new disbursement occurs (postfunding confirmation and transparency).
- altprecedence
  - Notify_Customer -> Transfer_Funds: each disbursement must be preceded by a customer notification (preadvice/consent, e.g., for staged draws).
- altsuccession
  - Gather_Additional_Documents <-> Quality_Assurance_Review: docs and QA must alternate: collect docs, then QA; if more docs are needed, collect again, then QA again (iterative completeness checks).
- chainresponse
  - Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package -> Transfer_Funds (immediately next): as written, disburse right after assembling the offer (very strict; see issues below).
- chainprecedence
  - Authorize_Contract_Terms -> Preliminary_Credit_Check (immediately previous): a credit check must be immediately preceded by authorization (see issues; likely inverted).
- chainsuccession
  - Quality_Assurance_Review <-> Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package (immediately adjacent, in this order): every QA must be immediately followed by assembling the package, and every assembly must be immediately preceded by QA (tight adjacency, no steps in between).
- noncoexistence
  - Transfer_Funds and Receive_Application cannot both occur in the same case (see issues; this would forbid any funded loan that had an application).
- nonsuccession
  - Notify_Customer –X-> Preliminary_Credit_Check: once you notify the customer, you may not run a credit check afterwards (prevents premature communications before risk checks).
- nonchainsuccession
  - Authorize_Contract_Terms –X-> Notify_Customer immediately: forbids notifying immediately after authorization (likely to avoid committing externally before funding or other controls).

How these rules support compliance, quality, and structure (when wellaligned)
- Compliance: absence(Z) prevents unlawful shortcuts; exactly_one(B) enforces permissible purpose and minimizes adverse credit impacts; precedence/response rules ensure KYC/AML/ATR happen before decisions or disbursement.
- Quality: QA before authorization and alternating Docs–QA cycles ensure completeness and correctness, reducing defects and misselling risk.
- Structure and transparency: init(event ordering) and succession/precedence/alternate patterns make the path auditable, reproducible, and easier to monitor with KPIs and controls (e.g., SLA between credit check and first doc request; “no funds without authorization,” etc.).
- Customer communication: alternate response/precedence around funds can implement both preadvice and postconfirmation, improving clarity and reducing disputes.

Important inconsistencies in the current model
- Unbreakable cycle around B, C, E, F:
  - chainprecedence(Authorize_Contract_Terms -> Preliminary_Credit_Check) demands F immediately before B.
  - succession(B -> C) demands C after B.
  - altsuccession(C <-> E) demands E after C and C before E.
  - precedence(E -> F) demands F before E.
  - Together they imply F before B, B before C, C before E, and E before F, which is impossible. This alone makes the model unrealizable.
- Disbursement vs. application:
  - noncoexistence(Transfer_Funds, Receive_Application) forbids any case that both receives an application and disburses funds. Since Receive_Application is required (existence + init) and other rules drive the process toward funding, this is contradictory to a normal funded case.
- Ordering around funding and notifications:
  - altresponse(Transfer_Funds -> Notify_Customer) and altprecedence(Notify_Customer -> Transfer_Funds) combined force every funding to be both preceded and followed by a notification (H–G–H–G…). That can be intentional (preadvice and confirmation), but it interacts with nonsuccession(Notify_Customer –X-> Credit_Check) to forbid the single required credit check from occurring after any notification; if you ever notify before funding, you risk banning the credit check later in the case.
- Immediate adjacencies:
  - chainresponse(Assemble_Package -> Transfer_Funds) plus chainsuccession(QA -> Assemble_Package) forces QA -> Assemble -> Fund as three consecutive steps, leaving no room for authorization, SoD checks, or customer acceptance between assembly and funding.

A coherent, realistic variant (one of several)
- Keep:
  - init(Receive_Application)
  - absence(Proceed_Without_Compliance)
  - exactly_one(Preliminary_Credit_Check)
  - succession(Preliminary_Credit_Check -> Gather_Additional_Documents)
  - altsuccession(Gather_Additional_Documents <-> Quality_Assurance_Review) to allow iterative doc/QA loops
  - precedence(Quality_Assurance_Review -> Authorize_Contract_Terms)
- Adjust:
  - Replace chainprecedence(Authorize_Contract_Terms -> Preliminary_Credit_Check) with precedence(Preliminary_Credit_Check -> Authorize_Contract_Terms) or response(Preliminary_Credit_Check -> Authorize_Contract_Terms). This puts credit gating before authorization.
  - Replace chainresponse(Assemble_Package -> Transfer_Funds) with response(Authorize_Contract_Terms -> Transfer_Funds). Funding should follow authorization, not merely package assembly.
  - Add response(Quality_Assurance_Review -> Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package) to reflect “QA clears the file, then assemble the offer.”
  - If you want both preadvice and confirmation around funding, keep both altprecedence(Notify_Customer -> Transfer_Funds) and altresponse(Transfer_Funds -> Notify_Customer). Otherwise, keep only altresponse(Transfer_Funds -> Notify_Customer) to ensure postfunding confirmation.
  - Replace noncoexistence(Transfer_Funds, Receive_Application) with precedence(Receive_Application -> Transfer_Funds) to prevent funding without an application.
  - Replace nonsuccession(Notify_Customer –X-> Credit_Check) with precedence(Preliminary_Credit_Check -> Notify_Customer) to prevent premature notifications.

Example of a consistent set (illustrative)
- init: Receive_Application
- absence: Proceed_Without_Compliance
- exactly_one: Preliminary_Credit_Check
- succession: Preliminary_Credit_Check -> Gather_Additional_Documents
- altsuccession: Gather_Additional_Documents <-> Quality_Assurance_Review
- response:
  - Quality_Assurance_Review -> Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package
  - Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package -> Authorize_Contract_Terms
  - Authorize_Contract_Terms -> Transfer_Funds
  - Transfer_Funds -> Notify_Customer
- precedence:
  - Receive_Application -> Preliminary_Credit_Check
  - Preliminary_Credit_Check -> Authorize_Contract_Terms
  - Receive_Application -> Transfer_Funds
- responded_existence: Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package -> Quality_Assurance_Review (optional)
- altresponse (optional for multiple draws): Transfer_Funds -> Notify_Customer

Business and regulatory drivers behind a stringent model
- Risk and prudential standards: ensure underwriting decisions follow evidence and checks (Basel/ICAAP principles).
- Consumer protection and credit bureaus: exactly-once credit pulls with consent (FCRA-like), adverseaction and approval notices timely and accurate.
- AML/KYC and fraud controls: documentation and QA loops before authorization and funding.
- Internal control and auditability: maker–checker (QA before authorization), segregation of duties, and an immutable order of activities for audit trails.
- Operational excellence: reduced rework and leakage by enforcing the critical path, preventing premature customer communications, and ensuring postfunding confirmations.

Bottom line
- The current model captures the right ideas (riskfirst, docs+QA, authorization before money, mandatory notifications), but a few constraint directions and the funding/application noncoexistence make it impossible to execute. Flipping the precedence on authorization/credit check, relaxing immediate adjacency to “eventually,” and replacing noncoexistence with precedence yields a controlled, auditable, and realistic loan process.
