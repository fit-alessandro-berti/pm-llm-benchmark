```sql
-- 1) look at every event in its temporal order inside the case  
--    and peek one and two steps ahead
WITH ordered AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        "timestamp",
        LEAD(activity      , 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS act_1,
        LEAD(activity      , 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS act_2,
        LEAD("timestamp"   , 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS ts_1,
        LEAD("timestamp"   , 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS ts_2
    FROM event_log
),

-- 2) flag every case that owns at least one qualifying triple
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered
    WHERE activity  = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'      -- first in the triple
      AND act_1     = 'Create Order'                      -- second, directly after
      AND act_2     = 'Confirm Order'                     -- third, directly after that
      AND (ts_2 - ts_1) > INTERVAL '5 days'               -- > 5-day gap between #2 and #3
)

-- 3) return all events that do NOT belong to such cases
SELECT  e.*
FROM    event_log AS e
LEFT JOIN cases_to_exclude AS x USING (case_id)
WHERE   x.case_id IS NULL
ORDER BY e.case_id, e."timestamp";
```

Explanation of the logic:

1. `ordered`  
   • For every event we fetch the activity and timestamp of the next (`LEAD(...,1)`) and the next-next (`LEAD(...,2)`) events inside the same case.  
   • That lets us inspect triples of consecutive events without self-joins.

2. `cases_to_exclude`  
   • We keep the case whenever a triple matches the exact order  
     ‘Approve Purchase Requisition’  ‘Create Order’  ‘Confirm Order’.  
   • The difference between the timestamps of the second and third events in that
     triple (`ts_2 - ts_1`) must exceed five days.

3. Final SELECT  
   • All events whose `case_id` is *not* in `cases_to_exclude` are returned, so the
     output contains only cases that either do not have the triple at all, or have it
     but with  5 days between ‘Create Order’ and ‘Confirm Order’.
