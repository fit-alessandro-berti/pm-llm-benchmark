# Queue Mining for Healthcare Process Optimization: A Data-Driven Approach to Reducing Patient Wait Times in Multi-Specialty Outpatient Clinics

## Executive Summary

The challenge facing this multi-specialty outpatient clinic represents a classic yet complex healthcare operations problem: patients experience prolonged wait times across multiple stages of their visit, leading to dissatisfaction and potentially compromising the quality of care delivery. The clinic's decision to leverage process mining, specifically queue mining techniques, provides a powerful data-driven foundation for understanding and addressing these bottlenecks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manual observation or periodic sampling, queue mining enables continuous, comprehensive analysis of every patient journey through the system, capturing the full variability and complexity of real-world operations.

This analysis presents a structured methodology for transforming raw event log data into actionable insights. By systematically identifying where queues form, understanding why they form, and implementing targeted interventions, the clinic can achieve meaningful reductions in patient wait times and overall visit duration. The approach balances the competing demands of operational efficiency, cost control, and care quality, ensuring that improvements in one dimension do not create degradation in another.

## 1. Queue Identification and Characterization

### 1.1 Extracting Waiting Times from Event Log Data

The fundamental building block of queue mining is the accurate calculation of waiting times between consecutive activities within each patient case. The event log structure, which captures both START and COMPLETE timestamps for each activity, provides all the information necessary to compute these waiting periods with precision. Understanding how to properly define and calculate waiting time is essential before any meaningful analysis can begin.

In this context, waiting time is defined as the elapsed time between the completion of one activity and the start of the subsequent activity in the patient's journey. Consider a patient who completes Registration at 09:08:45 and begins Nurse Assessment at 09:15:20. The waiting time between these two activities is the difference: 09:15:20 minus 09:08:45, which equals 6 minutes and 35 seconds. This waiting time represents pure queue time—the period during which the patient is waiting, typically in a waiting room, for the next stage of their care to begin.

It is crucial to distinguish waiting time from several related but distinct concepts. Service time, by contrast, refers to the duration of the activity itself—the time between START and COMPLETE for activities like Registration, Nurse Assessment, or Doctor Consultation. Total flow time encompasses both waiting time and service time, representing the end-to-end duration for a given activity including the queue that precedes it. Cycle time refers to the total time from the start of a case (typically Registration START) to the end of a case (typically Check-out COMPLETE), encompassing all waiting periods and all service times across the entire visit.

The calculation must be performed systematically across the entire event log. For each case, activities must be ordered chronologically, and for each pair of consecutive activities, the waiting time is computed as the START timestamp of the subsequent activity minus the COMPLETE timestamp of the preceding activity. This produces a comprehensive waiting time dataset that can be aggregated and analyzed at multiple levels of granularity.

### 1.2 Key Metrics for Queue Characterization

Once waiting times have been calculated, a robust set of metrics must be computed to fully characterize the queues that exist within the clinic's operations. Relying on a single metric such as average wait time provides an incomplete and potentially misleading picture; the full distribution of waiting times must be understood to identify patterns and prioritize interventions effectively.

**Central Tendency Metrics** form the foundation of queue characterization. The mean waiting time provides an overall average, useful for comparing different queues and tracking performance over time. However, healthcare waiting time distributions are typically right-skewed—a small number of patients experience very long waits while most patients experience shorter waits. The median waiting time, which represents the 50th percentile, provides a better measure of typical patient experience when distributions are skewed. Calculating both mean and median allows analysts to understand whether extreme values are distorting the average.

**Spread and Variability Metrics** reveal the consistency and predictability of the clinic's operations. The standard deviation of waiting times indicates how much variation exists around the average. High variability is problematic because it creates uncertainty for patients and makes capacity planning more difficult. The range, from minimum to maximum waiting time, shows the full extent of variation, though the maximum may be an outlier that requires separate investigation.

**Tail Risk Metrics** are particularly important in healthcare contexts where extended waits can have significant negative consequences. The 90th percentile waiting time indicates the maximum wait experienced by 90% of patients—meaning 10% of patients wait longer than this threshold. The 95th percentile provides an even more conservative estimate. These metrics are crucial for understanding the experience of patients who fare worst under current operations. The maximum waiting time, while potentially influenced by exceptional circumstances, identifies the upper bound of patient experience and may indicate systemic failures requiring immediate attention.

**Frequency and Volume Metrics** contextualize waiting times in terms of their operational impact. The queue frequency represents how often a particular waiting period occurs—waiting before Nurse Assessment may happen for every patient, while waiting before ECG might occur only for patients requiring that specific test. The number of cases experiencing excessive waits, defined as waits exceeding a clinically or operationally significant threshold (such as 30 minutes or the 90th percentile), identifies how many patients are adversely affected. This metric helps prioritize queues based on patient impact rather than just average statistics.

### 1.3 Identifying Critical Queues Requiring Immediate Attention

With comprehensive metrics calculated, the next challenge is identifying which queues warrant immediate intervention. Given finite resources for improvement initiatives, prioritization is essential. Several criteria, applied in combination, provide a robust framework for identifying the most critical queues.

**Impact on Overall Visit Duration** represents the first prioritization criterion. The total waiting time contribution of each queue to overall visit duration should be calculated. A queue with a long average wait that occurs frequently will have a larger aggregate impact on patient total visit time than a queue with a long average wait that occurs rarely. Mathematically, this can be expressed as the product of average waiting time and queue frequency. Queues with the highest total waiting time contribution represent the greatest opportunities for overall visit duration reduction.

**Patient Volume Affected** provides a second crucial dimension. A queue that affects 80% of patients, even with moderate waiting times, may warrant more attention than a queue that affects only 10% of patients with very long waits. The absolute number of patients experiencing problematic waits should be calculated, using thresholds such as the 90th percentile or a clinically defined maximum acceptable wait time. High-volume queues with excessive waits represent opportunities to improve the experience of the greatest number of patients.

**Urgency and Patient Type Stratification** adds nuance to the analysis. The event log includes patient type (New vs. Follow-up) and urgency (Normal vs. Urgent) attributes that should be used to stratify waiting time analysis. Urgent patients may have different service level expectations, and queues that disproportionately affect these patients may require expedited attention. Similarly, new patients often require more extensive workups and may experience different queue patterns than follow-up patients. Identifying queues that create particularly problematic waits for specific patient segments ensures that interventions address equity concerns as well as aggregate efficiency.

**Bottleneck Analysis** provides the final prioritization framework. In process terminology, a bottleneck is a resource or activity that constrains the overall throughput of the system. Queues that form immediately before a resource with high utilization are more likely to be true bottlenecks rather than temporary waiting situations. Process mining techniques such as resource analysis and bottleneck detection can identify which activities have the highest utilization and which resources are most constrained. Critical queues are those that consistently form before true bottlenecks, as these represent structural capacity limitations rather than temporary imbalances.

The synthesis of these criteria produces a prioritized list of queues for intervention. A queue that affects high patient volume, contributes significantly to total visit duration, particularly affects urgent patients, and precedes a genuine bottleneck represents the highest priority for improvement efforts.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Understanding the Sources of Queue Formation

Identifying where queues form is only the first step in addressing patient waiting times. Understanding why these queues form—the root causes—enables the development of effective, targeted interventions. Queue formation in healthcare settings typically stems from several interacting factors that must be systematically analyzed using the rich data available in the event log.

**Resource Bottlenecks** represent the most common structural cause of queue formation. When demand for a particular resource exceeds its capacity, queues necessarily form. The event log allows detailed analysis of resource utilization by examining the service times and intervals for each resource. For each staff member, room, and piece of equipment, utilization can be calculated as total busy time divided by total available time. Resources with utilization exceeding 80-85% are typically considered bottlenecks, as they have limited ability to absorb demand variability without creating queues. The event log also reveals which specific resources are involved in the most problematic queues, enabling targeted capacity analysis.

However, high utilization alone does not fully explain queue formation. The relationship between utilization and queuing is non-linear: small increases in utilization near capacity produce disproportionately large increases in queue times. This phenomenon, described by queueing theory, means that resources operating at 95% utilization will have vastly longer queues than resources at 85% utilization, even though the absolute difference in busy time is the same. The event log enables calculation of utilization for each resource, identifying which resources operate in this high-risk zone.

**Variability in Service Times** is a fundamental driver of queue formation that is often underappreciated. Healthcare service times exhibit substantial variability due to differences in patient conditions, complexity of cases, and inherent randomness in clinical activities. The event log captures actual service times (duration between START and COMPLETE for each activity), allowing calculation of the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) for each activity. Activities with high variability relative to their average duration create more queues than activities with consistent durations, even at the same average utilization level.

This occurs because variable service times create unpredictable gaps and backup points in the system. When some patients require longer-than-average service, they delay subsequent patients, creating cascading effects throughout the process. Analysis of the event log should identify activities with the highest service time variability, as these represent opportunities for intervention through standardization, triage protocols that route complex cases appropriately, or capacity buffers.

**Activity Dependencies and Handovers** create queues through synchronization requirements. Some activities cannot begin until specific preceding activities are completed, creating logical dependencies. More importantly, handovers between resources create coordination challenges. When one resource completes a patient and the next resource is not immediately available, waiting time accumulates. The event log reveals handover patterns by analyzing the intervals between activities and identifying cases where the subsequent activity is performed by a different resource. High handover frequency combined with long intervals between activities indicates coordination problems that may be addressable through better scheduling, communication, or organizational arrangements.

**Appointment Scheduling Policies** directly influence queue formation through their effects on arrival patterns and resource loading. If appointments are scheduled uniformly throughout the day but actual service times vary, some periods will experience higher load than others. The event log can be used to reconstruct the arrival pattern by analyzing Registration START timestamps. Comparing this arrival pattern to scheduled appointment times reveals the actual versus expected arrival distribution. Analysis can identify whether queues are concentrated at particular times of day, suggesting that scheduling policies create periodic overload conditions.

Furthermore, appointment duration assumptions embedded in scheduling systems can be compared against actual service times from the event log. If scheduled appointment slots are systematically shorter than actual service times, chronic overbooking and queuing will result. If scheduled slots are systematically longer, capacity is being underutilized. The event log provides the empirical foundation for evaluating and adjusting scheduling parameters.

**Patient Arrival Variability** interacts with scheduling policies to create or exacerbate queues. Even with perfect scheduling, patients do not arrive exactly at their appointed times. Analysis of the event log reveals the actual distribution of arrival times relative to scheduled times. Some patients arrive early, some late, and this variability creates inevitable queuing. The magnitude of this variability should be measured, as it establishes a baseline level of queuing that cannot be eliminated through scheduling improvements alone. However, if arrival variability is extreme, interventions such as reminder systems, arrival time staggering, or check-in process improvements may reduce this source of queuing.

### 2.2 Leveraging Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Discovery

Beyond the basic calculations described above, several advanced process mining techniques enable deeper root cause analysis using the event log data. These techniques leverage the rich structural information in the event log to reveal patterns and relationships that are not apparent from simple statistics.

**Process Discovery** techniques automatically construct a process model from the event log, revealing the actual flow of patients through the clinic rather than the intended or documented flow. The discovered model may show that patients follow multiple different paths through the clinic, that some activities can occur in parallel while others must be sequential, and that certain activity sequences are more common than others. This understanding of actual process structure is essential for identifying where queues are inherent to the process design versus where they result from suboptimal execution.

In particular, process discovery can reveal whether activities that could potentially occur in parallel are instead being executed sequentially due to resource constraints, organizational arrangements, or implicit rules. If the model shows that blood tests must always precede doctor consultations when clinical protocols might allow them to occur in parallel, this represents a process redesign opportunity that could significantly reduce waiting times.

**Bottleneck Analysis** techniques systematically identify which activities and resources most constrain the overall process. Various algorithms can calculate bottleneck scores based on the waiting times, service times, and resource utilization patterns in the event log. These techniques identify not just which activities have long waiting times, but which activities are the fundamental cause of those waits. An activity with long waiting times may itself be a bottleneck, or it may be a victim of downstream constraints. Bottleneck analysis distinguishes between these situations, enabling more effective intervention selection.

**Resource Analysis** techniques examine how resources are utilized and how resource availability affects process performance. These techniques can identify resources that are overloaded, resources that are underutilized, and resources that create constraints due to their allocation patterns. Social network analysis of resource interactions can reveal coordination patterns and identify resources that serve as critical connectors in the care process. If, for example, a particular nurse consistently precedes a particular doctor in patient pathways, changes to their schedules or colocation could reduce handover delays.

**Variant Analysis** compares different types of cases to identify factors that influence waiting times. Cases can be grouped by patient type, urgency, day of week, time of day, or other attributes from the event log. Comparing the waiting time distributions and process flows across these groups can reveal whether certain patient types systematically experience longer waits, whether certain times of day are particularly problematic, or whether specific specialty pathways have different queue characteristics. These comparisons generate hypotheses about root causes that can be tested through further analysis.

**Conformance Checking** compares the observed process behavior (as captured in the event log) against reference models such as ideal care pathways, standard operating procedures, or best-practice guidelines. Deviations between observed and expected behavior can indicate sources of delay and inefficiency. If certain activities are frequently performed out of sequence, if certain resources are frequently bypassed, or if certain pathways are commonly deviated from, these deviations may be creating or exacerbating queues. Understanding the nature and frequency of such deviations provides insight into where process discipline, training, or redesign may be needed.

## 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### 3.1 Strategy One: Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Demand

**Target Queue and Root Cause Addressed:** This strategy targets queues that form before high-utilization resources such as specific doctors, examination rooms, or diagnostic equipment. The root cause addressed is structural capacity mismatch—situations where resource supply does not align with demand patterns that are predictable from historical data.

**Data Support and Analysis Foundation:** The event log analysis reveals temporal patterns in demand that can be exploited for resource optimization. By analyzing the frequency of activities by hour of day, day of week, and week of month, predictable demand patterns can be identified. For example, the analysis might reveal that Cardiology consultations peak between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM on Tuesday through Thursday, that ECG testing demand increases sharply on Monday mornings, or that Nurse Assessment volume is consistently 20% higher on Friday afternoons than other days. Simultaneously, the event log reveals current resource schedules and utilization patterns, enabling identification of misalignments between when resources are available and when they are needed.

**Strategy Description:** Implement a demand-driven resource allocation model that adjusts staffing and room assignments based on predicted demand patterns. This involves three components. First, develop predictive models for patient volume and case mix by hour, day, and week, using the six months of historical event log data as training data. These models should account for seasonal patterns, day-of-week effects, and any other systematic variations visible in the data. Second, translate demand predictions into resource requirements, calculating how many registration clerks, nurses, doctors, and rooms of each type are needed to meet expected demand at target service levels. Third, adjust schedules in advance to align resource availability with predicted demand, and implement real-time adjustments when actual conditions diverge from predictions.

The implementation should start with the most problematic queues identified in the prioritization analysis. If, for example, queues before Doctor Consultation are the highest priority and analysis reveals that Dr. Smith consistently operates at 95% utilization while Dr. Jones operates at 70%, the strategy would involve redistributing patient assignments to balance load, potentially adding clinic hours for Dr. Smith or reassigning certain patient types to Dr. Jones.

**Expected Impact:** Based on queueing theory principles, balancing utilization across resources operating in the 85-95% range can reduce average waiting times by 30-50% for the affected queues. If the current average wait before Doctor Consultation is 25 minutes and resource utilization is balanced from 95% to 80%, the expected average wait could reduce to 12-15 minutes. The overall visit duration would decrease correspondingly, with the magnitude depending on the proportion of total visit time spent in the targeted queue.

### 3.2 Strategy Two: Parallel Processing and Pathway Redesign

**Target Queue and Root Cause Addressed:** This strategy targets queues that result from sequential activity dependencies—situations where patients must wait for one activity to complete before beginning another, even though the two activities do not fundamentally require sequential execution. The root cause addressed is process design that creates unnecessary serialization.

**Data Support and Analysis Foundation:** Process discovery applied to the event log reveals the actual flow of activities and identifies opportunities for parallelization. The analysis examines which activities commonly precede which other activities and whether there are cases where activities occur in parallel versus sequentially. If the log reveals that blood tests and doctor consultations are always sequential but could theoretically occur in parallel (they require different resources and do not depend on each other's results), this represents a parallelization opportunity.

Additionally, handover analysis reveals the time costs of sequential processing. If the average interval between Blood Test COMPLETE and Doctor Consultation START is 45 minutes, this includes both necessary clinical time and unnecessary waiting time. Benchmarking against best-case intervals in the data (the 10th percentile of such intervals) reveals how much of this time could potentially be eliminated through process redesign.

**Strategy Description:** Redesign patient pathways to enable parallel execution of activities that are currently serialized, reducing or eliminating the waiting time between them. This requires clinical validation to ensure that parallel processing is clinically appropriate, but many routine activities in outpatient settings can be rearranged.

Several specific interventions exemplify this strategy. First, implement parallel diagnostic testing where patients who require laboratory work or imaging can have these performed while waiting for or during their specialist consultation, rather than requiring a separate visit or a sequential wait. This may involve restructuring room assignments so that diagnostic equipment is co-located with consultation rooms, or implementing mobile diagnostic services that can perform tests in waiting areas. Second, redesign the nurse assessment process to occur in parallel with or immediately following registration, rather than as a separate waiting phase. If registration and nurse assessment use different resources and do not have inherent dependencies, they can be performed simultaneously with patients rotating through both stations. Third, implement real-time coordination mechanisms that trigger downstream activities when upstream activities complete, rather than relying on patients to navigate between stations. If a patient's registration completes at 09:15, the system should immediately alert the nurse assessment station rather than having the patient wait until a nurse becomes available through the normal flow.

**Expected Impact:** The impact depends on the specific parallelization opportunities identified and their frequency. For queues that are eliminated entirely, the waiting time reduces to near-zero for the affected patient proportion. For queues that are shortened through parallel processing, typical reductions of 40-60% in waiting time are achievable. If the queue before diagnostic tests currently averages 20 minutes and parallel processing reduces this to 8 minutes, the overall visit duration for affected patients reduces by 12 minutes, a substantial improvement in patient experience.

### 3.3 Strategy Three: Appointment Scheduling Optimization

**Target Queue and Root Cause Addressed:** This strategy targets queues that result from arrival pattern and scheduling mismatches—situations where appointment scheduling creates periodic overload followed by underutilization. The root cause addressed is suboptimal appointment slot allocation that fails to account for variability in service times and arrival patterns.

**Data Support and Analysis Foundation:** The event log enables detailed analysis of the relationship between scheduled appointments, actual arrivals, and resulting queue formation. By comparing Registration START timestamps to scheduled appointment times, the distribution of early and late arrivals can be characterized. By comparing scheduled appointment durations to actual service times, the accuracy of scheduling assumptions can be assessed. By analyzing queue formation patterns by hour and day, the periods of systematic overload can be identified.

Analysis might reveal, for example, that Monday morning appointments are consistently 15 minutes behind schedule throughout the morning, that new patient appointments take 35% longer on average than the scheduled 30-minute slot, or that patients scheduled for 09:00 AM arrive on average 8 minutes early while patients scheduled for 02:00 PM arrive on average 12 minutes late. These patterns provide the empirical foundation for scheduling optimization.

**Strategy Description:** Redesign the appointment scheduling system using data-driven approaches that account for service time variability, arrival patterns, and capacity constraints. This involves several interconnected interventions.

Implement duration estimation models that predict appropriate appointment duration based on patient attributes visible in the event log. If new patients, urgent patients, or patients with certain chief complaints consistently require longer service times, scheduled appointment slots should be adjusted accordingly. The event log provides the historical data to build and validate these prediction models, moving from uniform slot durations to differentiated durations based on predicted case complexity.

Introduce strategic spacing and staggering to smooth the arrival pattern. If analysis reveals that appointment scheduling creates artificial peaks, adjust the scheduling template to distribute arrivals more evenly. This might involve offering fewer appointments at traditionally popular times, offering incentives for patients to choose off-peak times, or implementing wave scheduling that groups appointments with shorter expected service times during peak periods.

Implement dynamic scheduling adjustments based on real-time conditions. If the event log reveals systematic patterns of delay accumulation (such as consistent 30-minute delays by 11:00 AM regardless of start time), the scheduling system should automatically adjust subsequent appointment times or reduce appointment density when delays are detected. This creates a feedback loop where the scheduling system adapts to current conditions rather than rigidly following a predetermined template.

**Expected Impact:** Scheduling optimization typically reduces average waiting times by 20-35% and substantially reduces variability in waiting times. The impact on the 90th percentile is often even greater than the impact on the mean, as reducing peak loads eliminates the most extreme waits. If the current 90th percentile wait before consultation is 55 minutes, scheduling optimization might reduce this to 35-40 minutes, dramatically improving the experience of patients who currently fare worst.

### 3.4 Strategy Four: Triage-Based Fast-Track Pathways

**Target Queue and Root Cause Addressed:** This strategy targets queues that disproportionately affect patients with simple, quick-service needs by creating separate pathways that bypass queues designed for complex cases. The root cause addressed is the mixing of patients with heterogeneous service time requirements in common queues, where simple cases are delayed by complex cases ahead of them.

**Data Support and Analysis Foundation:** Analysis of the event log reveals the distribution of service times for each activity and identifies whether certain patient segments consistently have shorter or longer service requirements. If, for example, follow-up patients have consultation service times averaging 12 minutes while new patients average 28 minutes, mixing these patient types in common queues creates inefficiency. The variance in service times within mixed queues can be quantified, and the queuing impact of this variance can be estimated using queueing theory relationships.

Additionally, variant analysis can identify whether certain diagnosis categories, referral types, or appointment reasons consistently cluster with particular service time profiles. This enables the development of triage criteria that can predict, at registration or shortly thereafter, which patients are likely to require simple versus complex service pathways.

**Strategy Description:** Implement a triage-based fast-track system that identifies patients with simple, quick-service needs at or shortly after registration and routes them through an accelerated pathway that bypasses queues designed for complex cases. This creates separate lanes for different patient types, reducing waiting times for simple cases while maintaining appropriate care for complex cases.

The triage mechanism should be based on data-driven prediction models built from the event log. Factors that predict shorter service requirements might include appointment type (follow-up vs. new), visit reason, patient age range, or initial assessment findings. The model should be validated on historical data to ensure that patients routed to the fast track truly have shorter service requirements and that the routing criteria do not inappropriately exclude patients who would benefit from fast-track processing.

Implementation requires physical or logical separation of patient flows during at least some portion of their visit. This might involve designated fast-track examination rooms, dedicated fast-track slots in provider schedules, or parallel processing pathways that complete the same clinical objectives through streamlined procedures.

**Expected Impact:** Fast-track pathways typically reduce waiting times for affected patients by 50-70% compared to the baseline mixed-queue experience. If fast-track patients previously waited an average of 30 minutes before consultation and now wait 10 minutes, the improvement is substantial. Additionally, removing simple cases from the main queues reduces waiting times for complex cases by reducing queue length, creating secondary benefits. Overall, implementing fast-track pathways can improve patient satisfaction scores by 15-25% for the affected patient population while maintaining clinical outcomes.

## 4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

### 4.1 Potential Negative Side-Effects of Optimization Strategies

While the optimization strategies described above offer significant potential for improving patient waiting times, each carries risks of unintended consequences that must be proactively managed. A comprehensive optimization program must anticipate these trade-offs and build mitigation strategies into the implementation plan.

**Bottleneck Shifting** represents the most common unintended consequence of optimization efforts. When one queue is reduced, patients move more quickly to subsequent stages of the process, potentially creating or exacerbating queues that were previously dormant. If resource allocation is optimized for registration and nurse assessment, patients may arrive at doctor consultation faster than the consultation capacity can handle, simply moving the queue location rather than eliminating it. The dynamic resource allocation strategy is particularly susceptible to this risk, as balancing utilization in one area may create imbalance in another.

Mitigation requires system-wide analysis that considers the entire patient journey rather than isolated queues. Before implementing any optimization, the downstream capacity of all subsequent resources should be assessed to ensure that improved flow can be absorbed. Additionally, monitoring should be implemented to detect bottleneck shifting after implementation, with rapid adjustment capability.

**Staff Workload and Satisfaction Impacts** can result from optimization strategies that increase utilization or require schedule adjustments. Dynamic resource allocation may require staff to work different hours or be reassigned to different tasks, potentially disrupting established routines and work-life balance. Parallel processing may require staff to manage multiple patients simultaneously, increasing cognitive load and multitasking requirements. If optimization is perceived as maximizing throughput at the expense of staff wellbeing, it can lead to burnout, turnover, and ultimately degraded care quality.

Mitigation involves engaging staff early in the optimization design process, clearly communicating the rationale for changes, and ensuring that optimization goals include staff experience as well as patient experience. Where schedule adjustments are required, they should be implemented gradually and with attention to fairness and work-life balance.

**Quality of Care Concerns** arise when efficiency pressures potentially conflict with thoroughness of care. Doctors who feel pressure to reduce consultation times may rush patient interactions. Staff focused on throughput metrics may skip important but time-consuming activities. The parallel processing strategy carries particular quality risks if clinical protocols require sequential processing that is being circumvented.

Mitigation requires clinical validation of all process changes, with quality and safety assessment preceding implementation. Metrics should include not only waiting times and throughput measures but also clinical quality indicators such as complication rates, return visit frequencies, and patient-reported outcome measures. Optimization should be explicitly bounded by quality constraints—efficiency improvements that compromise quality should be rejected.

**Cost Implications** vary across strategies but none are cost-neutral. Dynamic resource allocation may require additional staff coverage or overtime payments. Parallel processing may require physical plant modifications, additional equipment, or hiring. Scheduling optimization may require software system investments or consulting expertise. Fast-track pathways require triage system development and potentially additional staff.

Mitigation involves rigorous cost-benefit analysis before implementation, prioritizing strategies with favorable return on investment. Some strategies, particularly scheduling optimization through better utilization of existing resources, may have low direct costs and high returns. Others may require phased implementation to manage capital requirements.

### 4.2 Balancing Conflicting Objectives

The clinic faces inherently conflicting objectives: reducing waiting times, controlling costs, maintaining care quality, and ensuring staff satisfaction. Optimization is not about maximizing any single objective but about finding appropriate balances. Several principles guide this balancing act.

**Quality as a Constraint** rather than an objective ensures that efficiency improvements never come at unacceptable quality cost. Before implementing any optimization, minimum acceptable quality thresholds should be defined, and only improvements that maintain performance above these thresholds should be considered. Quality metrics should be monitored continuously during implementation, with automatic rollback capability if thresholds are violated.

**Patient-Centered Value** provides a framework for prioritizing among objectives. From the patient perspective, excessive waiting time is a significant source of dissatisfaction and may have clinical consequences for conditions where timely treatment matters. However, patients also value thorough, careful care and kind, unhurried interactions. Optimization should focus on removing non-value-added waiting time—the time patients spend waiting due to system inefficiencies—rather than reducing the time of value-adding clinical interactions. The event log analysis inherently supports this distinction by separating waiting time from service time.

**Staff Engagement in Trade-off Decisions** ensures that those most affected by optimization have input into how conflicts are resolved. Staff often have valuable insights about where inefficiencies exist and what changes would be practical to implement. They also have legitimate concerns about workload and job satisfaction that should be incorporated into optimization design. Participatory optimization processes that engage front-line staff tend to produce more sustainable improvements than top-down mandates.

**Iterative Implementation and Adjustment** acknowledges that optimal balances may not be known in advance and may shift over time. Rather than implementing comprehensive changes all at once, a phased approach allows learning from early phases to inform subsequent decisions. Monitoring should track not only the primary objectives but also potential side effects, enabling rapid detection and correction of problems.

## 5. Measuring Success

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators for Optimization Effectiveness

Measuring the success of optimization strategies requires a comprehensive set of Key Performance Indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of performance affected by the interventions. These KPIs should be defined before implementation, measured continuously during the pilot phase, and monitored ongoing after full deployment.

**Primary Waiting Time KPIs** directly measure the optimization objectives. The average waiting time before each identified critical queue should be tracked, with targets set based on the expected improvements from the optimization strategy. The 90th percentile waiting time is particularly important as it captures the experience of patients who fare worst. The proportion of patients experiencing waits exceeding defined thresholds (such as clinically unacceptable wait times) should be tracked, with targets for reduction. These metrics should be calculated separately for different patient segments to ensure that improvements benefit all patient groups equitably.

**Visit Duration KPIs** measure the overall patient experience. Total visit duration from Registration START to Check-out COMPLETE captures the cumulative effect of improvements across all queues. The distribution of visit durations, not just the average, reveals whether the optimization has reduced variability and eliminated extreme cases. Proportion of visits exceeding target duration thresholds provides a patient-focused measure of success.

**Throughput and Capacity KPIs** ensure that efficiency improvements do not come at the cost of reduced capacity. Patients served per day, per provider, and per room should be tracked to ensure that optimization enables serving more patients or at least maintains throughput while improving patient experience. Resource utilization rates should be monitored to ensure that optimization achieves efficiency without creating unsustainable overload conditions.

**Quality and Safety KPIs** monitor for unintended negative effects on care quality. Return visit rates within specified time windows may indicate that optimization is causing rushed care or missed diagnoses. Patient-reported outcome measures capture the clinical effectiveness of care. Complaint rates and patient satisfaction scores specifically related to waiting and overall experience provide direct feedback on the patient perspective.

**Staff KPIs** ensure that optimization does not degrade staff experience. Staff satisfaction scores, particularly related to workload and process efficiency, should be measured. Overtime hours and absenteeism rates may indicate unsustainable workload conditions. Staff turnover rates, while a lagging indicator, provide ultimate feedback on whether optimization is creating viable working conditions.

### 5.2 Ongoing Process Monitoring Framework

Optimization is not a one-time project but an ongoing capability that must be sustained and continuously improved. The event log structure provides the foundation for ongoing process monitoring that can detect performance degradation, identify emerging issues, and support continuous improvement.

**Automated Data Pipeline** should be established to ingest, process, and analyze event log data on a daily or real-time basis. The pipeline should automatically calculate waiting times for each queue, aggregate metrics across appropriate time windows, and flag significant deviations from expected performance. Modern process mining tools can support this automation, or custom solutions can be developed using standard data engineering approaches.

**Control Charts** for each critical KPI enable detection of both gradual drift and sudden shifts in performance. Control charts plot metric values over time with statistical control limits that distinguish common-cause variation from special-cause variation. When a metric exceeds control limits or shows trends toward degrading performance, alerts should trigger investigation and potential intervention. This approach prevents the gradual erosion of optimization gains that often occurs when performance is not actively monitored.

**Periodic Deep Analysis** should be scheduled regularly—quarterly or semi-annually—to examine process performance in detail beyond the ongoing monitoring metrics. This analysis should include updated process discovery to detect changes in actual process flows, variant analysis to identify emerging patterns in different patient segments, and root cause analysis of any issues detected through monitoring or other signals. This periodic analysis ensures that the optimization program evolves with changing conditions and continues to identify improvement opportunities.

**Feedback Loop to Optimization Strategies** closes the cycle between monitoring and improvement. When monitoring identifies performance gaps or emerging issues, this information should feed back into the optimization program to guide strategy refinement. If, for example, monitoring reveals that a particular queue has begun to deteriorate despite previous optimization, additional analysis and intervention may be required. The optimization program should be treated as a living system that continuously adapts based on performance data.

**Benchmarking and External Comparison** provides context for internal performance metrics. Where possible, the clinic should benchmark its performance against industry standards, published benchmarks from comparable organizations, or best practices from process mining research. This external perspective helps distinguish performance levels that are excellent, adequate, or in need of improvement relative to what is achievable.

## Conclusion

The application of queue mining techniques to the multi-specialty outpatient clinic's patient flow challenges offers a rigorous, data-driven pathway to meaningful improvement. By systematically extracting waiting times from the event log, characterizing queues through comprehensive metrics, prioritizing based on impact and patient volume, analyzing root causes through advanced process mining techniques, and implementing targeted optimization strategies, the clinic can achieve substantial reductions in patient waiting times and overall visit duration.

The four optimization strategies presented—dynamic resource allocation, parallel processing and pathway redesign, appointment scheduling optimization, and triage-based fast-track pathways—represent distinct approaches addressing different root causes. The optimal mix for any specific clinic depends on the particular patterns revealed in its event log and the specific constraints it faces. However, all strategies share the common foundation of data-driven decision-making, empirical analysis, and careful attention to trade-offs.

Success requires not only implementing these strategies but also building the ongoing monitoring and adaptation capabilities that sustain improvement over time. The event log structure that enables initial analysis also enables continuous monitoring, creating a virtuous cycle of measurement, improvement, and learning. With commitment to this systematic approach, the clinic can transform patient flow from a source of dissatisfaction to a source of competitive advantage, delivering better patient experiences while maintaining or improving care quality and managing operational costs effectively.
