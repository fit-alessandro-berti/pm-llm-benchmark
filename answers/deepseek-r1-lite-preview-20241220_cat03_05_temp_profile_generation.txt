To solve this problem, we need to create a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for a global supply chain process, which includes average times and standard deviations for the delays between various activities.

### Approach
1. **Activity Identification:** Identify all relevant activities in the supply chain process.
2. **Pair Selection:** Select a representative subset of activity pairs, including both directly connected and some indirectly connected pairs.
3. **Time Estimation:** Estimate average times and standard deviations for each pair based on typical supply chain processes.
4. **Dictionary Construction:** Organize these pairs and their associated times into a Python dictionary.

### Solution Code
```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 86400),   # 3 days avg, 1 day std dev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),  # 7 days avg, 2 days std dev
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 14400),    # 12 hours avg, 4 hours std dev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 21600),    # 1 day avg, 6 hours std dev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 86400),   # 2 days avg, 1 day std dev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 43200),    # 1 day avg, 12 hours std dev
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 7200),     # 6 hours avg, 2 hours std dev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (864000, 432000),  # 10 days avg, 5 days std dev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (15552000, 5184000), # 6 months avg, 2 months std dev

    # Indirectly connected pairs
    ('SS', 'QI'): (907200, 187200),  # Estimated avg and std dev
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1123200, 201600), # Estimated avg and std dev
    ('OP', 'CA'): (729600, 187200),  # Estimated avg and std dev
    ('RC', 'PT'): (259200, 90000),   # Estimated avg and std dev
    ('QI', 'PK'): (259200, 90000),   # Estimated avg and std dev
    ('CA', 'WS'): (259200, 90000),   # Estimated avg and std dev
    ('PT', 'DT'): (950400, 432000),  # Estimated avg and std dev
    ('PK', 'DT'): (885600, 432000),  # Estimated avg and std dev
    ('WS', 'AS'): (16416000, 5184000)# Estimated avg and std dev
}
```

### Explanation
- **Direct Pairs:** These are activities that typically follow each other in sequence. For example:
  - `('SS', 'OP')`: Time from Supplier Selection to Order Placement, estimated at 3 days on average.
  - `('OP', 'RC')`: Time from Order Placement to Receiving Components, estimated at 7 days on average.

- **Indirect Pairs:** These involve activities separated by one or more steps. For example:
  - `('SS', 'QI')`: Time from Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection, estimated based on sum of intermediate steps.
  - `('DT', 'AS')`: Time from Distribution to After-Sales Support, estimated over several months due to the nature of after-sales processes.

This dictionary provides a comprehensive yet manageable representation of the temporal profile for the given supply chain process, capturing both direct and indirect activity relationships with their respective average times and variability.
