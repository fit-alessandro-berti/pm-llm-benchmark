## A Process Mining-Based Approach to Manufacturing Excellence

---

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Process Reconstruction and Flow Analysis

To comprehensively analyze Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling performance, I would implement a multi-layered process mining approach:

**Event Log Preprocessing and Enhancement:**
- First, I would enrich the raw MES event logs by calculating derived attributes:
  - **Effective Processing Time** = Task End - Task Start (excluding setup)
  - **Total Setup Time** = Setup End - Setup Start
  - **Queue Wait Time** = Next Task Start - Previous Task End
  - **Job-to-Job Transition Matrix** = Sequence patterns between consecutive jobs on each machine

**Process Discovery and Variant Analysis:**
Using tools like Disco, Celonis, or ProM, I would:
- Generate process maps showing the actual flow paths of jobs through the shop floor
- Identify process variants (unique routing sequences) and their frequencies
- Create resource-activity matrices showing which machines process which operations
- Develop Petri nets or BPMN models to capture concurrent activities and resource sharing

### Key Performance Metrics Extraction

**Job Flow and Lead Time Analysis:**
```
Flow Time Distribution Analysis:
- Calculate percentile distributions (P50, P90, P95) for each job type
- Segment by priority class and routing complexity
- Identify seasonal or temporal patterns using time-series decomposition
- Apply survival analysis techniques to model time-to-completion probabilities
```

**Task Waiting Time Quantification:**
I would implement queue mining techniques:
- Calculate average queue length at each workstation over time
- Identify peak congestion periods using sliding window analysis
- Compute Little's Law validation: L = W (queue length = arrival rate × wait time)
- Generate heat maps showing queue buildup patterns across machines and time periods

**Resource Utilization Analysis:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for utilization calculation
for each machine in resources:
    productive_time = sum(task_durations where resource = machine)
    setup_time = sum(setup_durations where resource = machine)
    idle_time = available_time - productive_time - setup_time - breakdown_time
    
    utilization_productive = productive_time / available_time
    utilization_total = (productive_time + setup_time) / available_time
    setup_ratio = setup_time / (productive_time + setup_time)
```

**Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Mining:**
To quantify setup dependencies, I would:
1. Create a setup time matrix S[i,j] where S[i,j] represents setup time when job type j follows job type i
2. Apply clustering algorithms (k-means or DBSCAN) on job characteristics to identify setup families
3. Use regression analysis to model setup time as: 
   ```
   Setup_Time =  + (attribute_diff) + (tool_change) + (material_change) + 
   ```
4. Validate patterns through association rule mining (e.g., "If previous job had material X and current has Y, then setup > 30 min with 85% confidence")

**Schedule Adherence and Tardiness Metrics:**
- **Tardiness Distribution**: T = max(0, Completion_Date - Due_Date)
- **Service Level**: Percentage of jobs completed on time by priority class
- **Schedule Stability Index**: Frequency of schedule changes/disruptions per time period
- **Due Date Performance Curve**: Cumulative distribution of early/on-time/late deliveries

**Disruption Impact Assessment:**
Using event correlation analysis:
- Calculate Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for each machine
- Quantify ripple effects: jobs affected downstream from each breakdown
- Measure recovery time: duration until normal throughput restored post-disruption
- Analyze priority change patterns and their cascade effects on existing schedules

---

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### Bottleneck Identification and Impact Quantification

**Multi-Dimensional Bottleneck Analysis:**
I would employ the following techniques:

1. **Utilization-Based Detection**: Machines with utilization >85% consistently
2. **Queue-Based Detection**: Resources with persistent queue buildup (average queue length > 3 jobs)
3. **Shifting Bottleneck Analysis**: Track how bottlenecks migrate based on product mix changes
4. **Active Period Analysis**: Calculate the percentage of time each resource is the active constraint

**Impact Quantification:**
```
Bottleneck Impact Score = 
     × (Utilization_Rate) + 
     × (Average_Queue_Length) + 
     × (Downstream_Starvation_Hours) + 
     × (Schedule_Delay_Contribution)
```

### Task Prioritization Inefficiencies

**Evidence Mining Approach:**
- **Variant Analysis**: Compare process flows of on-time vs. late jobs
  - Identify decision points where late jobs were deprioritized
  - Quantify waiting time differences between priority classes
- **Priority Inversion Detection**: Cases where low-priority jobs blocked high-priority ones
- **Due Date Slack Analysis**: Correlation between remaining slack time and actual prioritization decisions

### Setup Time Optimization Failures

**Pattern Discovery:**
Using sequential pattern mining algorithms (PrefixSpan, GSP):
- Identify frequently occurring job sequences with high setup penalties
- Detect "setup thrashing" - rapid alternation between dissimilar job types
- Calculate potential setup savings through optimal sequencing:
  ```
  Setup_Waste = Actual_Total_Setup - Theoretical_Minimum_Setup
  ```

### Resource Starvation Analysis

**Starvation Pattern Identification:**
- **Upstream-Downstream Correlation**: Measure correlation between upstream delays and downstream idle time
- **Buffer Analysis**: Identify locations where WIP buffers are either excessive or insufficient
- **Flow Balance Assessment**: Calculate flow rate mismatches between consecutive operations

### WIP Accumulation Dynamics

**Bullwhip Effect Quantification:**
- Calculate coefficient of variation for WIP levels at each stage
- Perform spectral analysis to identify oscillation frequencies in WIP levels
- Use system dynamics modeling to trace amplification of variability through the production chain

---

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules

**Analysis Framework:**
Through comparative simulation using historical data:
- **Myopic Decision Making**: Quantify instances where local optimization led to global suboptimality
- **Context Ignorance**: Measure performance degradation when rules don't adapt to changing conditions (high vs. low load, different product mixes)
- **Single-Criterion Focus**: Demonstrate trade-off failures when rules consider only one dimension (e.g., due date without setup consideration)

### Real-Time Visibility Gaps

**Information Delay Analysis:**
- Calculate information propagation delays between shop floor events and scheduling decisions
- Identify "blind spots" - resources or states not captured in current monitoring
- Quantify decision quality degradation due to stale information:
  ```
  Decision_Error_Rate = f(Information_Age, System_Dynamics_Rate)
  ```

### Estimation Accuracy Issues

**Statistical Analysis of Estimation Errors:**
```python
# Estimation error analysis framework
for each task_type:
    actual_durations = extract_from_logs(task_type)
    planned_durations = extract_planned(task_type)
    
    error_distribution = actual - planned
    bias = mean(error_distribution)
    variance = var(error_distribution)
    
    # Identify systematic biases
    if abs(bias) > threshold:
        flag_for_recalibration(task_type)
    
    # Model factors affecting duration
    duration_model = regression(
        actual_duration ~ operator_skill + 
                        job_complexity + 
                        machine_age + 
                        time_of_day + 
                        cumulative_production
    )
```

### Sequence-Dependent Setup Handling

**Root Cause Identification:**
- Lack of setup time consideration in scheduling decisions (verified through decision log analysis)
- Absence of job batching or family grouping strategies
- No lookahead mechanism to evaluate setup implications of scheduling choices

### Work Center Coordination Failures

**Process Mining Evidence:**
- Analyze handoff patterns between work centers
- Identify synchronization failures in parallel operations
- Quantify information gaps between upstream and downstream operations

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Adaptive Multi-Criteria Dynamic Dispatching (AMDD)

**Core Logic:**
A sophisticated dispatching system that dynamically adjusts rule weights based on real-time shop floor conditions and predictive analytics.

**Implementation Framework:**
```python
def calculate_job_priority(job, machine, current_state, historical_patterns):
    # Base components
    slack_ratio = (job.due_date - current_time - remaining_work) / remaining_work
    setup_time = predict_setup_time(machine.current_job, job, historical_patterns)
    downstream_load = calculate_downstream_congestion(job.remaining_operations)
    
    # Dynamic weight adjustment based on shop state
    if current_state.bottleneck_utilization > 0.9:
        weight_setup = 0.4  # Prioritize setup reduction at bottleneck
        weight_due_date = 0.3
        weight_downstream = 0.3
    elif average_tardiness > threshold:
        weight_setup = 0.2
        weight_due_date = 0.5  # Focus on due date performance
        weight_downstream = 0.3
    else:
        weight_setup = 0.3
        weight_due_date = 0.3
        weight_downstream = 0.4  # Balance flow
    
    # Composite priority score
    priority = (weight_due_date * (1/max(slack_ratio, 0.1)) +
                weight_setup * (1/(setup_time + 1)) +
                weight_downstream * (1/(downstream_load + 1)) +
                priority_class_multiplier)
    
    return priority
```

**Process Mining Integration:**
- Historical patterns provide setup time predictions
- Bottleneck identification informs weight adjustments
- Performance feedback loops calibrate weight selection

**Expected Impact:**
- 25-30% reduction in average tardiness
- 15-20% reduction in total setup time
- 20% improvement in bottleneck throughput

### Strategy 2: Predictive-Reactive Hybrid Scheduling (PRHS)

**Core Logic:**
Combines predictive scheduling using machine learning with reactive adjustments based on real-time events.

**Architecture:**
```python
class PredictiveReactiveScheduler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prediction_horizon = 48  # hours
        self.reaction_threshold = 0.3  # deviation threshold
        
    def generate_predictive_schedule(self):
        # Use historical distributions from process mining
        task_durations = sample_from_historical_distributions()
        breakdown_predictions = predict_failures_from_patterns()
        
        # Generate robust schedule using stochastic optimization
        schedule = stochastic_job_shop_scheduler(
            jobs=pending_jobs,
            machines=available_machines,
            duration_distributions=task_durations,
            breakdown_scenarios=breakdown_predictions,
            objective='minimize_expected_tardiness'
        )
        
        # Add buffer times based on uncertainty
        schedule = add_strategic_buffers(schedule, critical_paths)
        return schedule
    
    def reactive_adjustment(self, disruption_event):
        affected_jobs = identify_affected_jobs(disruption_event)
        
        # Partial rescheduling with stability consideration
        revised_schedule = partial_reschedule(
            current_schedule=self.active_schedule,
            affected_jobs=affected_jobs,
            stability_weight=0.4,  # Avoid excessive nervousness
            method='shifting_bottleneck_heuristic'
        )
        
        return revised_schedule
```

**Predictive Components:**
- **Task Duration Prediction**: Neural network trained on historical data considering:
  - Operator skill level
  - Time of day/week effects
  - Machine condition indicators
  - Job complexity features

- **Breakdown Prediction**: 
  - Time-series analysis of breakdown patterns
  - Condition monitoring integration
  - Survival analysis for remaining useful life

**Expected Impact:**
- 30-35% reduction in schedule disruptions
- 25% improvement in due date reliability
- 15% reduction in emergency expediting

### Strategy 3: Setup Optimization through Intelligent Batching and Sequencing (SOIBS)

**Core Logic:**
Minimize total setup time through intelligent job grouping and optimized sequencing, particularly at bottleneck resources.

**Algorithm Design:**
```python
class SetupOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, setup_matrix, clustering_model):
        self.setup_matrix = setup_matrix  # From process mining
        self.job_families = clustering_model  # Job similarity clusters
        
    def optimize_bottleneck_sequence(self, bottleneck_queue):
        # Phase 1: Family batching
        batches = self.create_setup_families(bottleneck_queue)
        
        # Phase 2: Inter-batch sequencing using modified TSP
        batch_sequence = self.solve_batch_sequencing(batches)
        
        # Phase 3: Intra-batch optimization
        detailed_sequence = []
        for batch in batch_sequence:
            if len(batch) > 1:
                # Optimize within batch considering due dates
                batch_seq = self.optimize_within_batch(
                    batch, 
                    weight_setup=0.6, 
                    weight_due_date=0.4
                )
            else:
                batch_seq = batch
            detailed_sequence.extend(batch_seq)
        
        return detailed_sequence
    
    def create_setup_families(self, jobs):
        # Dynamic clustering based on setup similarity
        similarity_matrix = self.calculate_setup_similarity(jobs)
        
        # Constrained clustering considering due dates
        clusters = constrained_clustering(
            similarity_matrix,
            max_cluster_span=24,  # hours
            due_date_constraints=job_due_dates
        )
        
        return clusters
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Look-ahead Windows**: Consider next N jobs in queue for better global optimization
- **Setup Amortization**: Batch similar jobs even if slightly early to reduce total setups
- **Dynamic Family Definition**: Adjust clustering based on current product mix

**Expected Impact:**
- 35-40% reduction in total setup time at bottlenecks
- 20% increase in bottleneck effective capacity
- 15-20% reduction in average flow time

            patterns=process_mining_data.failure_patterns
        )
        
        self.arrival_model = ArrivalModel(
            process_mining_data.job_arrivals,
            seasonality=True
        )
    
    def run_scenario(self, scheduling_strategy, scenario_params):
        # Configure scenario
        self.configure_load_level(scenario_params['load'])
        self.set_disruption_frequency(scenario_params['disruptions'])
        self.set_product_mix(scenario_params['mix'])
        
        # Run simulation
        results = self.simulate(
            scheduling_strategy=scheduling_strategy,
            simulation_time=30*24*60,  # 30 days in minutes
            replications=50,
            warm_up_period=7*24*60
        )
        
        return self.calculate_kpis(results)
```

    def __init__(self):
        self.kpi_targets = {
            'on_time_delivery': 0.95,
            'avg_flow_time': 168,  # hours

    def continuous_monitoring(self):
        while True:
            current_kpis = self.calculate_current_kpis()
            
            # Detect performance degradation
            for kpi, value in current_kpis.items():
                if self.is_out_of_control(kpi, value):
                    self.trigger_investigation(kpi, value)
            
            # Detect concept drift
            if self.detect_drift():
                self.trigger_model_retraining()
            
            # Adaptive parameter tuning
            if self.performance_below_target():
                self.adjust_strategy_parameters()

def adaptive_learning_loop():
    # Collect recent performance data
    recent_performance = collect_last_period_data()
    
    # Compare with predictions

    # Update models if needed
    if mean(prediction_errors) > threshold:
        retrain_models(recent_data)
    
    # Adjust strategy parameters
