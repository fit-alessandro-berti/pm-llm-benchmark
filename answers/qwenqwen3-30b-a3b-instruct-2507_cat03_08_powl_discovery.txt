Based on the provided event log, we analyze the **execution patterns** across the 5 cases to infer the **correctly structured POWL model** that captures:

- The **sequential flow** of core activities,
- **Repetitions** (loops),
- **Choices** (e.g., labeling may be skipped),
- **Conditional branching** (e.g., re-testing after failure),
- **Concurrency** (none observed — all sequences are linear or nested),
- **Partial ordering** between sub-processes.

---

###  **Step 1: Identify the Core Sequential Flow**

All cases begin with:
```
OR  MS  QS  AS
```

Then:
- Some cases go through **IQC**, which may repeat (multiple IQC events).
- After IQC, **AS** may be repeated (seen in Cases 1, 3, 5).
- Then **TST** occurs.
- If **TST fails**, then **RT** (Re-Testing) occurs, which leads back to **TST** (loop).
- After successful **TST**, proceed to **PK**, **LB**, **DP**, **D**.

In **Case 2**, **LB is skipped**. In **Case 4**, **IQC and RT are skipped entirely**.

This suggests:
- **IQC** is optional and may repeat  **loop**.
- **RT** is conditional  **loop or choice**.
- **LB** is optional  **choice**.

---

###  **Step 2: Identify Loops**

#### **Loop 1: In-line Quality Check (IQC)**
- Seen multiple times: Case 1: 1 IQC, Case 3: 3 IQC, Case 5: 2 IQC.
- After IQC, **AS** is performed again.
- Then possibly another IQC.

So the flow is:
```
AS  IQC  (possibly back to AS)
```
But note: **IQC is not a standalone loop** — it's **after AS**, and only if the product fails.

But in **Case 4**, **no IQC** occurs  so **IQC is optional**, but when present, it may repeat.

So the correct interpretation is:
> After **AS**, there is a **loop**: either exit, or do **IQC**, then **AS** again.

But wait: in **Case 3**, the sequence is:
```
AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST
```
So **IQC** is **after AS**, and **AS** can be repeated multiple times.

Thus, the **loop** should be:
```
(AS  IQC) repeated until IQC passes  then exit to TST
```
But we don’t have an explicit “pass” signal.

However, **IQC is not a failure event** — it’s just a check. So the loop is **on IQC**, and after each IQC, we **may** go back to AS.

But the **only way to exit** is when **no further IQC** occurs.

So the loop should be modeled as:
> After **AS**, we **may** perform **IQC**, and **if we do**, we go back to **AS**.

This is a **loop that can be exited at any point**.

But in POWL, we model loops with `* (A, B)`:
> Execute A, then either exit, or execute B and then A again.

So we model:
```
* (AS, IQC)
```
But this would mean: do AS, then either exit or do IQC and repeat AS.

But **IQC is not done after every AS** — only if needed.

So the correct loop is:
> After **AS**, we may do **IQC**, and if so, go back to **AS**.

So we model:
```
* (AS, IQC)
```
But this is **not quite right** — because **IQC** is not the continuation of **AS**, but a **post-check**.

Actually, the loop should be:
> Do **AS**, then **IQC**, then **if needed**, repeat **AS**.

But this is **not a standard loop** — it's more like a **loop over a cycle: AS  IQC**, and **exit after IQC**.

But the **exit condition is not known**.

However, **in the data**, the loop **ends when IQC is not followed by AS**.

So the only way to model this in POWL is to consider that **IQC is part of a loop that can be repeated**.

But **IQC is not a standalone activity** — it's **after AS**, and **leads back to AS**.

So the correct loop structure is:

> After **AS**, we may perform **IQC**, and then **repeat AS**.

So we model:
```
* (AS, IQC)
```
But this implies: **do AS**, then either exit or do **IQC** and then **AS** again.

But **IQC is not done after every AS** — only sometimes.

So this model **does allow** skipping IQC (by exiting the loop), which is correct.

But **IQC is not a loop body** — it’s a **condition**.

Wait — **this is not a loop** in the traditional sense.

Let’s reconsider: **IQC is not a loop**, but **a check** that may trigger **re-assembly**.

So the correct structure is:
- After **AS**, **IQC** is performed.
- Then, **if IQC fails**, **AS is repeated**.
- But we don’t have failure events — only the sequence.

So we **cannot model failure** directly.

But from the data, **IQC can be repeated**, and **AS can be repeated after IQC**.

So the only way to model this is to say:
> After **AS**, there is a **loop**: do **IQC**, then **AS**, and repeat.

But this would mean **IQC must happen every time**, which is not true.

In **Case 4**, **IQC is skipped entirely**.

So the loop must be **optional**.

Hence, the correct interpretation is:
> After **AS**, there is a **choice**: either exit, or go to **IQC**, then **AS** again.

But that would allow **IQC  AS** only once.

But **Case 3** shows **IQC  AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS**, so **multiple iterations**.

Thus, the only way to model this in POWL is a **loop** where:
- You **do AS**
- Then **either exit**, or **do IQC**, then **repeat AS**

So the loop is:
```
* (AS, IQC)
```
But this means: do **AS**, then either exit, or do **IQC**, then do **AS** again.

But **IQC** is not **after** **AS** in the loop body — it’s **after** **AS**, and **before** the next **AS**.

But **IQC** is **not** part of the loop body — it’s a **transition**.

Wait — **this is a problem**.

In POWL, `* (A, B)` means:
> Execute A, then either exit, or execute B and then A again.

So if we write:
```python
* (AS, IQC)
```
Then:
- Execute **AS**
- Then either exit, or execute **IQC** and then **AS** again.

But **IQC** is not **after AS** — it’s **after AS**, but **before** the next **AS**.

But in the loop, **IQC** is executed **between** two **AS**s.

So this **does work** — because the loop body is **A**, and **B** is executed **in between**.

So the loop:
```
* (AS, IQC)
```
Means:
- Start with **AS**
- Then either exit (no IQC, no repeat)
- Or do **IQC**, then **AS** again.

But **IQC** is not **part of the loop body** — it’s the **bridge**.

But in this case, **IQC is not a separate activity** — it’s a **check** that may trigger a re-AS.

But **in the log**, **IQC is an event**, so it **must be modeled as an activity**.

So the loop:
```
* (AS, IQC)
```
is **valid** and **correct** — because:
- After **AS**, you may do **IQC**, then **AS** again.
- If you do **IQC**, you must go back to **AS**.
- But **IQC** is not repeated — it’s just one event.

But in **Case 3**, **IQC** happens **three times**, each time followed by **AS**.

So the loop must **allow multiple iterations**.

And `* (AS, IQC)` **does allow** that — because after **IQC**, you go back to **AS**, and the loop repeats.

So yes, this is correct.

But note: **IQC is not executed after every AS** — only when needed.

But in this model, **you can skip IQC** by exiting the loop — so **IQC is optional**.

Perfect.

So:
> After **AS**, there is a loop: `* (AS, IQC)` — but wait, that would mean **AS** is the loop body, and **IQC** is the continuation.

But in the loop `* (A, B)`, **A** is executed first, then **either exit or B**, then **A again**.

So if we write:
```python
* (AS, IQC)
```
Then:
- Execute **AS**
- Then either exit (no IQC), or execute **IQC**, then **AS** again.

But **IQC** is **after AS**, and **before the next AS**.

Yes — this matches the data.

But **IQC** is **not** the only thing after **AS** — in **Case 4**, **AS** is followed directly by **TST**.

So **IQC is optional** — and **after AS**, you may go directly to **TST**.

But in the loop model, **if you skip IQC**, you exit the loop — so you go to **TST**.

Perfect.

So the loop **must be placed after AS**, and **before TST**.

But **IQC** is not the only thing — in **Case 1**, after **IQC**, **AS** happens again.

So yes.

Thus, the loop is:
```
* (AS, IQC)
```
But wait — **this loop includes AS as the body**.

But **AS** is executed **before** the loop, and then **again** after IQC.

So the loop is **over AS**, with **IQC** as the continuation.

But **IQC** is not a loop body — it’s a **transition**.

But in POWL, this is acceptable.

So we define:
```python
loop_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])
```

But wait — in `* (A, B)`, **A** is executed first, then either exit or **B**, then **A** again.

So **A** is the loop body.

But in our case, **AS** is executed **before** the loop, then **IQC**, then **AS** again.

So we need to **start the loop with AS**.

But **AS** is already executed once.

So we can model:
> After the first **AS**, we enter a loop: `* (AS, IQC)` — but this would mean **AS** is executed again, and then **IQC**.

But **IQC** should come **after** **AS**, not before.

Wait — the order is:
- AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST

So the loop should be:
> After **AS**, do **IQC**, then **AS**, and repeat.

But in POWL, `* (A, B)` means:
- A
- then either exit, or B, then A

So if we set:
- A = IQC
- B = AS

Then:
- IQC  then either exit or AS  then IQC

But that would mean **IQC** is first — but it should be **after AS**.

So this is not correct.

Alternative: model the loop as:
> After **AS**, we may do **IQC**, then **AS** again.

So the loop body is **IQC**, and the continuation is **AS**?

No — that doesn’t make sense.

Wait — the correct interpretation of `* (A, B)` is:
> Execute A, then either exit, or execute B and then execute A again.

So **A** is the **loop body**, **B** is the **bridge**.

So to have:
> AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST

We need:
- First AS
- Then loop: `* (IQC, AS)` — but that would mean:
  - Execute IQC
  - Then either exit or AS  then IQC again

But **IQC** is not the first thing — **AS** is.

So we cannot start the loop with **IQC**.

Thus, we need to **include AS in the loop**.

But **AS** is executed **before** the loop.

So the only way is to **start the loop with AS**, and then **IQC** as the continuation.

So:
```python
* (AS, IQC)
```
Then:
- Execute AS
- Then either exit (go to TST), or execute IQC, then execute AS again.

But in this case, **IQC** is executed **after** **AS**, and **before** the next **AS**.

Yes — this matches.

But **IQC** is **not** the loop body — it’s the **bridge**.

But in POWL, this is acceptable.

So the loop:
```python
* (AS, IQC)
```
means:
- Do AS
- Then either exit, or do IQC and then do AS again.

Perfect — this matches:
- Case 1: AS  IQC  AS  TST
- Case 3: AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST
- Case 5: AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST
- Case 4: AS  TST (no IQC)

So this works.

But **IQC** is not repeated — it’s **executed once per loop iteration**.

Yes.

So we define:
```python
loop_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])
```

But wait — in `* (A, B)`, **A** is the body, **B** is the continuation.

So **A** is executed, then **B**, then **A** again.

So if **A = AS**, **B = IQC**, then:
- AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  ...

But **IQC** is **after** **AS**, and **before** the next **AS**.

Yes — this is correct.

But **IQC** is **not** part of the body — it’s **after**.

But in POWL, it's allowed.

So this is **correct**.

---

###  **Step 3: Re-Testing Loop (RT  TST)**

In Cases 1, 3, 5:
- TST  RT  TST

So:
> After **TST**, if failed, do **RT**, then **TST** again.

So this is a **loop**: `* (TST, RT)`

Because:
- Execute **TST**
- Then either exit, or do **RT**, then **TST** again.

But **RT** is **after** **TST**, and **before** the next **TST**.

So:
```python
loop_RT = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])
```

But note: **RT** is **not** executed after every **TST** — only when needed.

So **exit** is allowed.

Yes — this matches.

In **Case 4**, **TST** is executed once, no **RT** — so exit.

Perfect.

---

###  **Step 4: Labeling (LB) — Optional**

In **Case 2**, **LB is skipped**.

In **Case 4**, **LB is present**.

So **LB is optional**.

So we model:
```python
xor_LB = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, SilentTransition()])
```

This means: **either do LB, or do nothing**.

Perfect.

---

###  **Step 5: Partial Order (Sequential Flow)**

Now, we build the full **StrictPartialOrder** with the following nodes:

1. OR
2. MS
3. QS
4. AS  loop_IQC (which includes AS and IQC)
5. TST  loop_RT (which includes TST and RT)
6. PK
7. LB  xor_LB (optional)
8. DP
9. D

But **AS** is used in **loop_IQC**, so we must **not** repeat it.

So the nodes in the partial order are:

- OR
- MS
- QS
- loop_IQC (a POWL model)
- loop_RT (a POWL model)
- PK
- xor_LB (a POWL model)
- DP
- D

Now, define the **partial order**:

- OR  MS  QS  loop_IQC  loop_RT  PK  xor_LB  DP  D

All are **sequential**.

No concurrency.

So:
```
order = {
    OR  MS,
    MS  QS,
    QS  loop_IQC,
    loop_IQC  loop_RT,
    loop_RT  PK,
    PK  xor_LB,
    xor_LB  DP,
    DP  D
}
```

But **loop_IQC** and **loop_RT** are **POWL models**, so we can add edges between them.

Yes.

---

###  **Final POWL Model Structure**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities

AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")

# Silent transition for optional LB
skip = SilentTransition()

# Loop: AS  IQC  AS  ... (optional IQC)
loop_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])

# Loop: TST  RT  TST  ... (optional RT)

# Optional LB: either LB or nothing
xor_LB = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

# Root: StrictPartialOrder with all nodes in order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, loop_IQC, loop_RT, PK, xor_LB, DP, D])

# Add partial order edges
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_IQC)
root.order.add_edge(loop_IQC, loop_RT)
root.order.add_edge(loop_RT, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, xor_LB)
root.order.add_edge(xor_LB, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

###  **Summary of Model**

- **Sequential flow**: OR  MS  QS  [loop_IQC]  [loop_RT]  PK  [optional LB]  DP  D
- **Loop_IQC**: After AS, may do IQC and repeat AS.
- **Loop_RT**: After TST, may do RT and repeat TST.
- **Optional LB**: Either do LB or skip (silent).
- **No concurrency** — all activities are in sequence.

This model captures:
- All observed paths (Cases 1–5),
- Multiple iterations of IQC and RT,
- Skipping of LB and IQC/RT in some cases,
- Correct order of activities.

###  Final Answer (POWL Structure in Text Form):

```text
POWL Model:

StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes = {OR, MS, QS, loop_IQC, loop_RT, PK, xor_LB, DP, D},
    order = {
        OR --> MS,
        MS --> QS,
        QS --> loop_IQC,
        loop_IQC --> loop_RT,
        loop_RT --> PK,
        PK --> xor_LB,
        xor_LB --> DP,
        DP --> D
    }
)

where:
- loop_IQC = *(AS, IQC)  [Loop: after AS, optionally do IQC and repeat AS]
- loop_RT = *(TST, RT)   [Loop: after TST, optionally do RT and repeat TST]
- xor_LB = X(LB, tau)    [Choice: do LB or skip silently]
```

This is the **correct POWL model** for the given event log.
