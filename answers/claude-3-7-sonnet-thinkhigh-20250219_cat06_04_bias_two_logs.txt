# Analysis of Bias in Loan Application Event Logs

After examining both event logs, I've identified evidence of systematic bias against Group A (Protected Group). This bias is primarily manifested through scoring adjustments and decision thresholds that favor Group B (Unprotected Group).

## Identified Bias Mechanisms

### 1. The "Community Boost" Score Adjustment

The most apparent bias mechanism is the "+10 (Community Boost)" score adjustment that is:
- Only applied to Group B applicants (U001 and U003) who belong to the Highland Civic Darts Club
- Never applied to any Group A applicants

### 2. LocalResident and CommunityGroup Correlation

There is a clear correlation between attributes:
- All Group B applicants are local residents (LocalResident = TRUE)
- All Group A applicants are non-local residents (LocalResident = FALSE)
- Only Group B applicants have community group affiliations

### 3. Impact on Decision Outcomes

The scoring bias directly affects approval decisions:
- Case U003 had a preliminary score of 695, received a +10 boost to 705, and was approved
- Meanwhile, case P002 had a higher preliminary score of 710, received no boost, and was rejected

This demonstrates that the score adjustment system creates a lower effective threshold for Group B applicants with community affiliations.

## Decision Threshold Analysis

Looking at the decision outcomes across both groups:
- Approval threshold appears to be around 710-720 points
- Group A applicants must meet this threshold with their raw scores
- Group B applicants can benefit from the +10 adjustment, allowing approval with preliminary scores as low as 695

## Systematic Disadvantage

The bias creates a systematic disadvantage for the Protected Group (Group A) because:
1. They have no pathway to receive score adjustments
2. They are held to a higher effective standard (needing higher preliminary scores)
3. The community group membership that triggers the score boost appears unavailable to them as non-local residents

The scoring system's use of community group membership as a factor creates an indirect but clearly measurable form of discrimination against the Protected Group, resulting in different standards for approval between the two groups.
