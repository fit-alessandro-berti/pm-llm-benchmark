### **Analysis of Recurring Activities**

From the event log, we observe that the following activities appear multiple times within the same case and have distinct contextual meanings:

#### **1. `Verify Documents`**
- **First Occurrence**: Initial verification of documents (e.g., identity documents) to assess eligibility or completeness.
- **Second Occurrence**: Re-verification of documents after additional information is submitted (e.g., an ID scan or account adjustment).

#### **2. `Call Customer`**
- **First Occurrence**: Outbound call to request missing information or clarify discrepancies.
- **Second Occurrence**: Follow-up call to confirm actions have been completed or to inform the customer of updates.

#### **3. `Adjust Account`**
- **First Occurrence**: Adjustments made based on information received from the customer or a call (e.g., correcting account details).
- **Second Occurrence**: No second occurrence in the same case, so no need to rename.

### **Justification of Naming Choices**

- **`Initial Document Verification` vs `Re-Verification of Documents`**  
  The first instance is the initial check of documents, while the second occurs after additional information is submitted, requiring a re-check. These names clearly distinguish the purpose and timing of the activity.

- **`Outbound Call for Clarification` vs `Follow-Up Call to Confirm`**  
  The first call is to request missing information or clarify a discrepancy, while the second is to confirm that a process (e.g., account adjustment) has been completed. This naming reflects the intent and stage of the interaction.

- **`Adjust Account` remains unchanged**  
  This activity only occurs once per case and does not require disambiguation.

### **Conclusion**

By renaming the recurring activities based on their contextual roles in the process flow, the revised event log becomes more interpretable and useful for process mining, analysis, and improvement. The names now clearly reflect the intent and stage of each activity within a case.
