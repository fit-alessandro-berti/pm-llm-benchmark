It’s a Petrinet style workflow of a “compensation request” process.

- Rounded rectangles are activities: 
  a register request, b examine thoroughly, c examine casually, d check ticket, e decide, f reinitiate request, g pay compensation, h reject request, and z end.
- Small black circles are places/conditions, and arcs show the possible flow of tokens.
- After a (register), the case can be examined thoroughly or casually and the ticket can be checked; there are feedback loops that may reinitiate the request via f and send it back for (re)examination/checks.
- A decision e leads exclusively to either g (pay compensation) or h (reject request); both paths converge to z (end).

The inset at the bottom right is a legend illustrating routing constructs used by the net: XOR/AND/OR splits and XOR/AND/OR joins.
