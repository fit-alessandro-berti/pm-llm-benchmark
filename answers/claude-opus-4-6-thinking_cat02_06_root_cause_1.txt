# Customer Support Ticket Resolution — Performance Analysis

---

## 1. Total Resolution Times

| Case | Start | End | Total Duration | Status |
|------|-------|-----|---------------|--------|
| **101** | Mar 1, 08:00 | Mar 1, 10:15 | **2 h 15 min** |  Normal |
| **102** | Mar 1, 08:05 | Mar 2, 09:15 | **25 h 10 min** |  Slow |
| **103** | Mar 1, 08:10 | Mar 1, 09:30 | **1 h 20 min** |  Normal |
| **104** | Mar 1, 08:20 | Mar 2, 08:30 | **24 h 10 min** |  Slow |
| **105** | Mar 1, 08:25 | Mar 3, 09:30 | **49 h 5 min** |  Very Slow |

> **Average  20.4 hours.** Cases **102, 104, and 105** are significantly above the benchmark set by Cases 101 and 103 (~1–2 hours). Case 105 is roughly **25× longer** than the fastest case.

## 2. Activity-Level Breakdown & Root Cause Identification

To pinpoint where time is lost, here are the inter-activity durations for every case:

### Fast Cases (101 & 103) — Baseline

| Transition | Case 101 | Case 103 |
|---|---|---|
| Receive  Triage | 10 min | 5 min |
| Triage  Assign | 10 min | 15 min |
| Assign  Investigate | 40 min | 15 min |
| Investigate  Resolve | 1 h | 30 min |
| Resolve  Close | 15 min | 15 min |

These follow a smooth, linear path with no escalation and minimal idle time.

### Slow Cases — Where the Delays Hide

| Transition | Case 102 | Case 104 | Case 105 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Receive  Triage | 25 min | **40 min** | 10 min |
| Triage  Assign | 30 min | 30 min | 25 min |
| Assign  Investigate | *(escalated first)* | **3 h 30 min**  | 10 min |
| Assign  Escalate | **2 h 30 min**  | — | — |
| Investigate  Escalate | — | — | 50 min |
| Escalate  Investigate | **2 h 30 min**  | — | **28 h**  |
| Investigate  Resolve | **19 h**  | **19 h**  | **19 h**  |
| Resolve  Close | 15 min | 30 min | 30 min |

## 3. Identified Root Causes

### Root Cause A: **Escalation to Level-2 Introduces Massive Waiting Time**

Cases **102** and **105** both include an escalation step. This is the single most impactful factor:

- **Case 102:** After escalation, the Level-2 agent doesn't begin investigation for **2.5 hours**, and then the resolution takes until the next business day (**19 hours**).
- **Case 105:** After escalation, the Level-2 agent doesn't even begin a second investigation for **28 hours** (essentially the next business day plus half a day), and resolution then takes another **19 hours**.

> **Insight:** Level-2 agents appear to have limited availability or a large backlog. The escalation handoff is not a quick re-route — it results in the ticket sitting idle for extended periods.

### Root Cause B: **Long Waiting Time Between Assignment and Investigation**

- **Case 104** was never escalated, yet it took **3 hours 30 minutes** from assignment to the start of investigation — compared to 15–40 minutes in the fast cases.

> **Insight:** This suggests the assigned Level-1 agent was either overloaded with other work, unavailable, or the ticket lacked prioritization. This idle time alone added hours before any substantive work began.

### Root Cause C: **Overnight / Cross-Day Resolution Gaps**

All three slow cases show an **~19-hour gap** between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket," with investigation ending in the afternoon and resolution occurring the next morning (e.g., 13:00  next day 08:00). This strongly suggests:

> **Insight:** Work stops at end of business day and resumes the next morning. There is no overnight coverage or shift handoff for in-progress investigations, causing every unresolved ticket to incur at least a **full overnight delay**.

### Root Cause D: **Slower Initial Triage on Some Tickets**

Case 104 took **40 minutes** to triage (vs. 5–10 min in fast cases). While minor on its own, this compounds with downstream delays.

## 4. Summary of Factors & Recommendations

| Factor | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Escalation handoff delays** |  Very High — adds 2.5–28 hrs of idle time | Implement **SLAs for Level-2 pickup time** (e.g., 1 hour). Create a dedicated escalation queue with real-time alerts. Consider a warm handoff instead of a cold transfer. |
| **Agent availability / assignment-to-investigation gap** |  High — up to 3.5 hrs idle after assignment | Monitor **agent workload in real time**; use workload-balanced auto-assignment. Flag tickets idle >30 min after assignment. |
| **No overnight/off-hours coverage** |  High — adds ~15–19 hrs per overnight gap | Introduce **shift-based staffing** or an on-call model for high-priority tickets. Alternatively, set expectations with SLAs that account for business hours and prioritize carryover tickets first thing in the morning. |
| **Triage delays** |  Low-Medium | Automate initial triage using **ticket categorization rules or ML classification** to reduce manual triage time to near-zero. |

### Key Takeaway

> The dominant bottleneck is the **escalation-to-Level-2 pathway**, which combines a slow handoff with overnight work stoppages. Case 105 illustrates the worst case: escalation + overnight gap + second investigation + another overnight gap = **49 hours**. Addressing Level-2 availability and implementing continuous (or expedited) handling of escalated tickets would yield the greatest reduction in overall cycle time.
