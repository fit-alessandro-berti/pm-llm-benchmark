**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

1. **Idle State (Events 1-3 and 13-15):**
   - **Sensor Readings:**
     - Temperature: 20-21°C
     - Pressure: 1 bar
     - Vibration: 0 Hz
     - Material Flow: 0 units/s
     - Tool Position: 0 mm
     - Energy: 0.40-0.50 kWh
   - **Label:** Idle
   - **Rationale:** Low or zero values in all parameters indicate that the machine is not performing any active task and is likely in a standby or idle mode.

2. **Cutting Metal (Events 4-6):**
   - **Sensor Readings:**
     - Temperature: 50-58°C
     - Pressure: 1-1.5 bar
     - Vibration: 30-38 Hz
     - Material Flow: 5 units/s
     - Tool Position: 5-10 mm
     - Energy: 2.00-3.00 kWh
   - **Label:** Cutting Metal
   - **Rationale:** Increased temperature, vibration, and material flow, along with rising tool position, suggest an active cutting process where material is being fed and processed.

3. **Assembling Parts (Events 7-8):**
   - **Sensor Readings:**
     - Temperature: 40°C
     - Pressure: 2 bar
     - Vibration: 10 Hz
     - Material Flow: 2 units/s
     - Tool Position: 15 mm
     - Energy: 2.00 kWh
   - **Label:** Assembling Parts
   - **Rationale:** A decrease in temperature and vibration from the cutting phase, along with reduced material flow and a higher tool position, indicate parts are being positioned or assembled.

4. **Welding (Event 9):**
   - **Sensor Readings:**
     - Temperature: 80°C
     - Pressure: 2 bar
     - Vibration: 50 Hz
     - Material Flow: 0 units/s
     - Tool Position: 15 mm
     - Energy: 5.00 kWh
   - **Label:** Welding
   - **Rationale:** A significant spike in temperature and vibration, coupled with zero material flow, suggests a high-energy operation like welding, where energy is concentrated at a specific point.

5. **Quality Inspection (Events 10-12):**
   - **Sensor Readings:**
     - Temperature: 25-30°C
     - Pressure: 1 bar
     - Vibration: 1-5 Hz
     - Material Flow: 0-1 units/s
     - Tool Position: 15-20 mm
     - Energy: 1.00-1.60 kWh
   - **Label:** Quality Inspection
   - **Rationale:** Low activity levels, including minimal vibration and material flow, suggest a period where the machine is inspecting the assembled or welded parts without active processing.

**Summary of Labeled Activities:**

1. **Idle (Events 1-3, 13-15):** Machine is not performing any task, in standby mode.
2. **Cutting Metal (Events 4-6):** Active cutting operation with material being processed.
3. **Assembling Parts (Events 7-8):** Parts are being positioned or assembled with reduced material flow.
4. **Welding (Event 9):** High-energy operation with elevated temperature and vibration, no material flow.
5. **Quality Inspection (Events 10-12):** Minimal activity, likely inspecting the product for quality assurance.
