Process Enhancement (PE) is a domain-specific problem-solving technique used to improve operational efficiency, especially in software systems. In process mining, PE focuses on improving an existing process by identifying opportunities for optimization or refinement, rather than just extracting data.

### Process Improvement

Process improvement involves identifying inefficiencies and areas where operations are inefficiently carried out. This approach helps businesses make more efficient use of resources like time, space, labor, money, and energy, aiming to drive greater productivity and profitability.

Here’s how PE differs from process discovery:

1. **Process Discovery:**
   - Process Discovery is focused on understanding the causes of inefficiencies in a particular process. It aims to discover which parts of the process are causing problems by examining the operations that lead to those issues.
   
2. **Process Enhancement:**
   - PE, on the other hand, focuses on identifying and improving specific processes rather than just discovering inefficiencies. This approach is intended to enhance performance in existing systems.

3. **Scope and Focus:**
   - Process enhancement typically involves optimizing or enhancing a single process for which specific issues were identified, rather than extending to larger organizations or systems with broader efficiency needs.
   
4. **Process Improvement Methods:**
   - PE often uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from multiple sources to identify inefficiencies in the process.
   - It typically focuses on finding bottlenecks that are not obvious from a glance at the code.

5. **Targeting and Methodology:**
   - PE is often used to optimize processes within specific organizations, aiming to improve efficiency across all departments and systems within the organization.

### Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

Process discovery aims to identify inefficiencies in existing processes through extensive data analysis. While process enhancement aims at improving processes specifically identified by process mining, conformance checking focuses on verifying whether a set of processes is actually operating as intended.

Here are key differences:

1. **Purpose:**
   - Process discovery primarily aims for improving specific processes, while process enhancement seeks to improve overall operational efficiency.
   
2. **Methodology:**
   - Conformance checking can be performed in various methods depending on the organization’s needs and capabilities, whereas process mining is more about analyzing data to identify inefficiencies.

3. **Scope:**
   - Both methods often require specific data collection and analysis, but they aim to improve operational processes across different departments and systems.
   
4. **Targetedness:**
   - While process enhancement focuses on optimizing one process, process discovery targets a subset of potential processes, aiming for greater efficiency.

In summary, while both approaches focus on improving processes through optimization or refinement, process mining addresses issues that are not obvious from an inspection of code alone and is tailored more towards maximizing the operational benefits of a specific process. Process improvement is more focused on understanding inefficiencies within a process and enhancing efficiency, whereas conformance checking focuses on whether a system or program is functioning as intended for certain purposes or conditions.
