Below is a plain-language narrative that walks through the loan-approval process implied by the DECLARE model, explains how each constraint shapes the flow, and highlights the business reasons and possible consequences of deviating from the rules.

--------------------------------------------------
1. Receive Application (init, existence)
   • What happens: The customer submits a loan application—this is the formal start of the case.  
   • Rule enforced: Because “Receive_Application” is marked as both init and existence, every process instance must begin with (and must contain at least one) receipt of an application.  
   • Why it matters: Without a documented application, there is no legal basis to process a loan request, and capturing it first guarantees an audit trail.

2. Preliminary Credit Check (exactly_one, response from Receive Application, chainprecedence target)
   • What happens: Immediately after intake, the lender runs a basic credit-worthiness screen.  
   • Rules enforced:  
     – “Response (Receive_Application  Preliminary_Credit_Check)” ensures the credit check eventually follows the application.  
     – “Exactly_one” forces the check to be performed once—and only once—per case, avoiding redundant pulls that can hurt the applicant’s score or generate conflicting results.  
     – “Chainprecedence (Authorize_Contract_Terms  Preliminary_Credit_Check)” means no contract terms can be authorized unless this credit check occurred immediately beforehand in the trace.  
   • Why it matters: Regulations and sound risk practice dictate that a lender must evaluate credit before requesting further documents or committing to terms.

3. Gather Additional Documents (existence, succession from Preliminary Credit Check, coexistence with Authorize Contract Terms, altsuccession source)
   • What happens: If the credit screen is acceptable, the applicant is asked for pay stubs, IDs, bank statements, etc.  
   • Rules enforced:  
     – “Succession (Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents)” demands that once the credit check occurs, document collection must follow (though other steps may appear in between).  
     – “Coexistence” couples this task with “Authorize_Contract_Terms”: if one happens, the other must also happen somewhere in the case—ensuring that terms are never authorized without the supporting docs and vice-versa.  
     – “Altsuccession (Gather_Additional_Documents  Quality_Assurance_Review)” specifies that after documents are gathered, either a direct QA review must follow or some alternative path that satisfies “altsuccession” (here, only QA is allowed).  
   • Why it matters: Document collection supports Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements, income verification, and fraud prevention.

4. Quality Assurance Review (precedence for Authorize Contract Terms, chainsuccession target, responded_existence target)
   • What happens: An internal QA officer double-checks completeness, compliance, and adherence to policy before anything is finalized.  
   • Rules enforced:  
     – “Precedence (Quality_Assurance_Review  Authorize_Contract_Terms)” guarantees that no authorization can happen unless QA happened earlier in the same case.  
     – “Chainsuccession (Quality_Assurance_Review  Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package)” requires that immediately after QA the loan offer package is assembled.  
     – “Responded_existence (Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Quality_Assurance_Review)” cross-checks from the other direction: if someone drafts a package, a QA review must (at some point) exist.  
   • Why it matters: QA prevents clerical errors, pricing mistakes, or regulatory breaches from slipping through.

5. Assemble Loan Offer Package (responded_existence source, chainsuccession target, chainresponse source)
   • What happens: The final term sheet, amortization schedule, and disclosures are compiled for approval.  
   • Rules enforced:  
     – Must come right after QA (chainsuccession).  
     – Triggers “Chainresponse (Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Transfer_Funds)”: once the package is assembled, the very next recorded step must be fund transfer—signaling that assembly only happens when everything else is ready for immediate payout.  
   • Why it matters: Keeps the “last mile” tight—reducing the window for data to become stale or tampered with.

6. Authorize Contract Terms (coexistence partner with Gather Docs, precedence target for QA, chainprecedence source for Preliminary Credit Check, nonchainsuccession source to Notify Customer)
   • What happens: A delegated authority signs off on the offer, making it legally binding.  
   • Rules enforced:  
     – Cannot precede QA (precedence).  
     – Must have had a credit check immediately before it somewhere earlier in the trace (chainprecedence).  
     – “Nonchainsuccession (Authorize_Contract_Terms  Notify_Customer)” forbids notifying the customer in the very next step—there must be at least one other activity (here, transfer of funds) in between to avoid premature communication.  
   • Why it matters: Ensures signatures happen on well-vetted terms and controls sequencing of customer communications.

7. Transfer Funds (chainresponse target from Assemble Package, altresponse source to Notify Customer, noncoexistence with Receive Application)
   • What happens: Money is disbursed to the borrower’s account.  
   • Rules enforced:  
     – Must happen immediately after assembling the offer package (chainresponse).  
     – Once funds move, “Altresponse (Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer)” guarantees that some form of customer notification follows eventually.  
     – “Noncoexistence (Transfer_Funds  Receive_Application)” prohibits these two from co-occurring in the same trace—ensuring you never transfer funds in the same log where an application is merely received without the rest of the process. (Operationally, this catches any accidental “fast-track” transfers.)  
   • Why it matters: Funding without proper context is a major operational and fraud risk.

8. Notify Customer (altprecedence target for Transfer Funds, nonsuccession restriction with Preliminary Credit Check)
   • What happens: The borrower is formally informed—e.g., “Your loan has been funded,” including next steps and repayment schedule.  
   • Rules enforced:  
     – “Altprecedence (Notify_Customer  Transfer_Funds)” means notification can occur only if funds were transferred earlier (or an allowed alternative).  
     – “Nonsuccession (Notify_Customer  Preliminary_Credit_Check)” stops the sequence where you would notify and then (later in the log) go back to run a credit check, which would be nonsensical.  
   • Why it matters: Communication should reflect true loan status and avoid confusing or misleading the customer.

9. Forbidden Activity: Proceed_Without_Compliance (absence)
   • Rule enforced: “Absence” declares that this event must never appear. If it does, the trace is immediately non-compliant.  
   • Why it matters: It represents a catastrophic bypass of the bank’s mandatory checks and would violate laws and internal policy.

--------------------------------------------------
Consequences of Violations (Illustrative)

• Skipping the Preliminary Credit Check: Would breach Fair Lending and risk policies, possibly leading to unknowingly funding high-risk borrowers and incurring regulatory fines.

• Transferring Funds before QA or Authorization: Could result in disbursing incorrect amounts, violating underwriting guidelines, and exposing the lender to fraud and capital loss.

• Notifying the Customer before Funds Transfer: Generates false expectations, undermines trust, and may trigger legal obligations (Truth-in-Lending disclosures) prematurely.

• Executing “Proceed_Without_Compliance”: Likely triggers immediate regulatory reporting, heavy penalties, and reputational damage.

--------------------------------------------------
Real-World Motivations for the Rules

1. Regulatory Compliance: Credit checks, KYC document gathering, and QA reviews align with banking regulations (e.g., CFPB, OCC in the U.S.).  
2. Fraud Prevention & Risk Management: Sequencing ensures each control layer validates the previous one before money leaves the institution.  
3. Operational Best Practices: Exactly-once and chain constraints eliminate duplicate work, reduce errors, and shorten cycle time.  
4. Customer Satisfaction: A clear, ordered process avoids repeated document requests and confusing status updates.  
5. Audit & Traceability: Existence and absence rules guarantee a complete audit trail and highlight any anomalous paths instantly.

--------------------------------------------------
Summary Flow (High Level)

Receive Application  
   Preliminary Credit Check (only once)  
      Gather Additional Documents  
         Quality Assurance Review  
            Assemble Loan Offer Package  
               Transfer Funds  
                  Notify Customer  

At no time may “Proceed_Without_Compliance” appear, and constraints tightly couple QA, authorization, funding, and notification so that each step happens in the right order, exactly once where required, and never prematurely. Any missing or out-of-order step flags the entire case as non-compliant, prompting investigation or remediation before proceeding.
