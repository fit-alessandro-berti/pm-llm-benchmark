The concept of "event abstraction" can significantly enhance the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs by simplifying the representation of the process without losing critical information. Here's how it can be effectively utilized:

### 1. **Hierarchical Decomposition of Events**
   - Complex event logs often contain detailed granular events that can overwhelm process modelers. By abstracting events into higher-level, more general events, process models can be simplified. For example, individual steps such as “input data”, “validate data”, and “save data” can be abstracted into a single event, “process data”.
   - **Effectiveness**: This reduction in granularity can create a hierarchical view of processes, making it easier for analysts to explore the process at different levels of detail, depending on their needs.

### 2. **Domain-Specific Abstractions**
   - Event abstraction can involve mapping low-level technical events (e.g., database operations) to domain-specific events (e.g., “invoice created”, “payment processed”). This makes the process models more understandable to domain experts who might not be familiar with technical terminology.
   - **Effectiveness**: This type of abstraction aligns the process models more closely with the business perspective, facilitating communication between IT and business stakeholders.

### 3. **Pattern Recognition and Aggregation**
   - Processes often contain repeating patterns or subprocesses that can be difficult to recognize in raw event logs. Abstracting these repeating sequences of events into a single high-level event (e.g., recognizing a loop of approval steps as a single event “approval process completed”) can remove unnecessary complexity.
   - **Effectiveness**: This allows for cleaner, more manageable models by reducing clutter and improving insight into process dynamics.

### 4. **Condensing Parallel Events**
   - Many processes involve concurrent or parallel events (e.g., while one task is being approved, another task is being worked on). These can be abstracted to show that two streams are happening in parallel without detailing every execution step.
   - **Effectiveness**: Abstraction in this way keeps the model manageable for humans by concealing fine-grained details that are not necessary for high-level understanding, while emphasizing the process's key parallelism.

### 5. **Abstracting Out Low-Value or Repeated Events**
   - Non-essential events, such as system logs or events related to background tasks that do not directly impact the business process (e.g., “system backup started”), can be abstracted away or grouped together.
   - **Effectiveness**: This strategy focuses the attention of users on critical process steps and ensures that the model is not cluttered with irrelevant or repeated events that do not contribute to overall process insight.

### 6. **Mapping Events to Key Process Stages**
   - Complex processes often involve stages (e.g., initiation, execution, closure). By grouping individual events into larger process stages (e.g., all actions in the initiation stage are abstracted into “Initiating Process”), you can make the overall flow clearer and break down the model into digestible stages.
   - **Effectiveness**: It helps users to grasp the big picture by providing a more intuitive structure, which improves both interpretability and manageability.

### 7. **Use of Visual Abstractions**
   - Visualization tools can present abstracted views of processes where low-level events are collapsed or hidden during navigation. Users can drill down into more detail when necessary but primarily interact with the process at an abstracted, high level.
   - **Effectiveness**: Visual abstraction helps non-technical users focus on the high-level phases of the process and only delve into more complicated event details as needed. This dynamic zooming capability improves both the user experience and model utility.

### 8. **Eliminating Noise and Exception Handling with Abstraction**
   - Many event logs contain outliers or exceptional behaviors that are not part of the “normal” process flow. These can be abstracted away into exceptional cases or anomalies instead of being shown as part of the standard process model.
   - **Effectiveness**: By focusing on general or standard cases and abstracting away exceptional or noisy information, the core process can be easily modeled, and exceptional behavior can be treated separately, e.g., in secondary diagrams or annotations.

### 9. **Role-Based Abstraction**
   - In collaborative processes, events can be abstracted according to roles, allowing a process analyst to focus on specific actors in the process. For instance, activities performed by a 'Sales' role can be abstracted into “Sales activities” without showing every individual sales action.
   - **Effectiveness**: This enables modular analysis by focusing on what is most relevant for specific stakeholders (e.g., Sales, Finance, IT) and improves cross-functional visibility at different abstraction levels.

### How Event Abstraction Improves Outcomes:
- **Reduces process complexity**: By hiding unnecessary details, event abstraction helps to combat the natural complexity of real-world processes.
- **Improves Model Readability**: It enhances the clarity of the process model, yielding more straightforward diagrams that are easier to interpret.
- **Facilitates Stakeholder Communication**: Domain-specific abstraction bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders by presenting different versions suited to various integrators.
- **Encourages Hierarchical Exploration**: Analysts can drill down into the details as necessary, allowing multi-level exploration and incremental learning.

### Tools and Techniques:
- **Process mining software**: Tools like ProM, Disco, or Celonis are commonly used for abstracting complex event logs into manageable models by simplifying repetitions and grouping related actions.
- **Machine Learning**: Pattern recognition and machine learning models can assist by identifying repetitive, parallel, or complex structures in event logs that can be abstracted intelligently.
- **Business Process Modeling Language (BPMN)**: BPMN supports abstraction by providing various constructs like subprocesses and events that can represent complex tasks succinctly.

### Conclusion:
By effectively using event abstraction, modelers can reduce clutter, focus on relevant events, and enhance comprehension without losing important information. This is key for creating manageable, readable process models that are useful for diagnostics, optimization, and communication across stakeholders.
