Alright, I need to help Precision Parts Inc. improve their scheduling. Let me start by digesting the problem. They're a job shop with custom metal components, facing issues like high tardiness, WIP, unpredictable lead times, underutilized resources, and disruptions. Their current method uses simple dispatching rules without a global view.

First, I should figure out how to analyze their historical data using process mining. The log has timestamps, events, job details, resources, durations, setups, etc. I think I can use logs to map actual job flows, measure durations, identify waiting times, resource utilization, and disruption impacts.

For job flow times, I'll look at the time between job release and completion. I can calculate this for each job and maybe see patterns where certain machines are bottlenecks. Lead times Distribution might show how consistent or variable their processing times are, which could point to inefficiencies.

Task waiting times at each machine can be found by looking at when a job enters a queue versus when it starts processing. High waiting times indicate either high demand or inefficient scheduling.

Resource utilization would require looking at how busy each machine is. Productive time is when it's processing, idle when it's not, and setup is downtime between jobs. Using these, I can find underutilized or overworked machines.

Setup times are tricky because they depend on previous jobs. I can cluster jobs based on their sequence and see if similar previous jobs lead to predictable setup durations. That would help in modeling setup times more accurately.

Schedule adherence is about how often jobs meet their due dates. I'll need to compare planned vs. actual finish times. High tardiness might mean scheduling isn't accounting for setup times or disruptions well.

Disruptions like breakdowns and hot jobs can be flags in the logs. I can measure how often these occur and how they affect overall performance, maybe by observing lead time increases or resource idling during disruptions.

Moving on, I need to diagnose the root issues. It seems like they have bottleneck machines, poor prioritization, sequence-dependent setup inefficiencies, and a bullwhip effect. Maybe using variant analysis—comparing on-time vs. late jobs—I can spot problematic paths. Contention periods can be found by looking at times when many jobs are queued on the same machine.

Root causes likely stem from static scheduling rules in a dynamic environment. Without real-time visibility, they can't adjust. Their setup time estimations might be rough, not considering sequence, and they don't handle disruptions well.

For strategies, I think dynamic dispatching rules with multiple factors, predictive scheduling using historical data, and setup optimization could work. Each should address specific issues, like handling sequence-dependent setups or resource contention.

Simulation is key to test these strategies. Using data from process mining, I can model different scenarios, like high load or frequent disruption, to see how each strategy holds up. Then, continuous monitoring with machine learning can adapt as more data comes in, keeping the schedule optimal.

Overall, linking process mining insights to strategic changes is the way to tackle their problems. By addressing bottlenecks, improving scheduling logic, and handling disruptions better, they can reduce tardiness, lower WIP, and make lead times more predictable.

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

To analyze the historical scheduling performance and dynamics at Precision Parts Inc., we can leverage process mining techniques on the provided MES event logs to extract actionable insights. Here's how:

#### Reconstruction and Analysis of Job Flow and Task Sequences
- **Process Map Creation:** Construct a high-level process map to visualize the flow of jobs through the shop floor, identifying key activities/tasks, resources (machines), and dependencies. This map will reveal the sequence of operations for each job and highlight bottlenecks or redundant steps.

- **Case Concept Analysis:** Analyze individual job (case) journeys through the shop floor, focusing on their start times, completion times, and durations at each work center. This will help identify patterns, such as recurring delays at specific machines or tasks.

- **Task Sequence Mining:** Extract the actual execution sequences of tasks for each job to compare with the planned sequences. Deviations from the planned sequence can indicate scheduling inefficiencies or disruptions.

#### Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics

- **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
  - Compute the total flow time for each job (time from release to completion).
  - Calculate the lead time (time from job release to due date) and assess how often jobs are completed on time or late.
  - Determine makespan (total time from the first job start to the last job completion) to evaluate overall shop floor efficiency.

- **Task Waiting Times:**
  - For each task, calculate the time spent in the queue before starting execution.
  - Identify machines or work centers with consistently high waiting times, indicating potential bottlenecks.

- **Resource Utilization:**
  - Analyze machine utilization by calculating the percentage of time each machine is active vs. idle.
  - Break down utilization into productive time (task execution) and non-productive time (setup, breakdowns).

- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
  - Group jobs by the sequence of tasks performed on each machine.
  - Compute the average setup times for each sequence of jobs and identify significant deviations from planned durations.
  - Use clustering or association rule mining to identify relationships between previous jobs and setup times.

- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
  - Measure the deviation from due dates by calculating the difference between the actual completion time and the due date.
  - Identify jobs that are frequently late and analyze the root causes (e.g., long setups, resource contention).

- **Disruption Impact Analysis:**
  - Flag events such as breakdowns, priority changes, and urgent jobs in the log.
  - Calculate the additional delays caused by these disruptions and assess their impact on overall scheduling performance.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Based on the performance analysis, the following pathologies may be identified:

#### Bottleneck Resources
- **Identification:** Machines with consistently high waiting times, low utilization, or frequent breakdowns.
- **Impact:** Bottlenecks can significantly slow down the entire production process, leading to increased cycle times and tardiness.

#### Poor Task Prioritization
- **Evidence:** High-priority jobs that are frequently delayed due to lower-priority jobs being processed first.
- **Analysis:** Use variant analysis to compare the performance of high-priority vs. low-priority jobs and identify instances where prioritization rules failed.

#### Suboptimal Sequencing
- **Impact:** Increased setup times and longer cycle times due to poor sequencing of jobs on machines.
- **Analysis:** Highlight machines where frequent sequence changes result in excessive setup times.

#### Starvation of Downstream Resources
- **Impact:** Downstream machines are idle due to upstream delays, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Analysis:** Identify periods where downstream resources are idle while upstream queues are long.

#### Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels
- **Impact:** Unpredictable fluctuation of WIP due to variability in task durations, setups, and disruptions.
- **Analysis:** Track WIP levels over time and correlate them with scheduling variability.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

#### Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules
- **Issue:** Static rules are inadequate in dynamic environments with frequent disruptions and varying job priorities.
- **Analysis:** Identify instances where static rules led to inefficiencies, such as not adjusting for machine breakdowns or urgent jobs.

#### Lack of Real-Time Visibility
- **Impact:** Schedulers operate without up-to-date information on machine availability or job progress.
- **Analysis:** Highlight delays caused by unexpected breakdowns or resource unavailability that could have been mitigated with better visibility.

#### Inaccurate Durations and Setup Times
- **Impact:** Delays due to underestimation of task durations or setup times.
- **Analysis:** Compare planned vs. actual durations and setups to identify persistent over- or underestimation.

#### Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups
- **Impact:** Increased setup times due to poor sequencing.
- **Analysis:** Identify machines where setup times vary significantly based on the previous job.

#### Poor Coordination Between Work Centers
- **Impact:** Unbalanced workload distribution and resource starvation.
- **Analysis:** Highlight instances where upstream delays caused downstream idle times.

#### Inadequate Disruption Handling
- **Impact:** Frequent breakdowns and hot jobs disrupt schedules, leading to increased tardiness.
- **Analysis:** Calculate the frequency and impact of disruptions on scheduling performance.

### 4. Advanced Scheduling Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules
- **Dynamic Multi-Criteria Dispatching:** Develop rules that consider multiple factors, including due dates, setup times, task urgency, downstream load, and operator expertise.
- **Adaptive Weighting:** Adjust the importance of each criterion based on real-time shop floor conditions.
- **Benefits:** Reduces tardiness, balances resource utilization, and minimizes WIP.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling
- **Machine Learning Models:** Train models on historical task durations, setup times, and breakdown frequencies.
- **Scenario Simulation:** Use predictive analytics to simulate different scheduling scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Benefits:** Generates more accurate schedules, identifies risks early, and informs proactive resource allocation.

#### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization
- **Intelligent Job Batching:** Group similar jobs together to minimize setup changes.
- **Optimized Sequencing:** Use historical data to determine the optimal sequence of jobs on bottleneck machines.
- **Benefits:** Reduces setup times, improves machine utilization, and shortens lead times.

### 5. Simulation and Continuous Improvement

Discrete-event simulation can be used to test the proposed strategies under various scenarios, such as high load or frequent disruptions. Metrics like makespan, cycle time, and WIP levels can be compared across simulations. Additionally, setting up a continuous improvement framework with ongoing process mining ensures the scheduling strategy adapts to changing conditions, maintains optimal performance, and addresses any new inefficiencies that emerge.
