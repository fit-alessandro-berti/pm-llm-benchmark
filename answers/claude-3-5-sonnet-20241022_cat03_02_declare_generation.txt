I'll help you create a DECLARE model for a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. Here's a model with common activities and logical constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Requisition': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Approve Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Process Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Make Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Purchase Requisition': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'succession': {
        ('Create Purchase Requisition', 'Create Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Approve Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'response': {
        ('Receive Goods', 'Process Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Process Invoice', 'Make Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'precedence': {
        ('Approve Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Process Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Approve Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Make Payment', 'Create Purchase Requisition'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    }
}
```

This model represents a P2P process with the following business rules:

1. All core activities must occur at least once (existence)
2. Create Purchase Order must occur exactly once (exactly_one)
3. The process must start with Create Purchase Requisition (init)
4. Create Purchase Requisition must be followed by Create Purchase Order, and Create Purchase Order must be followed by Approve Purchase Order (succession)
5. After receiving goods, an invoice must be processed, and after processing an invoice, payment must be made (response)
6. Goods can only be received after Purchase Order approval, and Invoice can only be processed after goods are received (precedence)
7. Approve Purchase Order must immediately follow Create Purchase Order (chainresponse)
8. Payment and new Purchase Requisition cannot coexist in the same process instance (noncoexistence)

This model ensures a logical flow of the P2P process while maintaining important business rules and dependencies between activities.
