### Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):** 
   - *Anomaly Detected:* Average time is 25 hours with a very low standard deviation (~1 hour). This suggests an unusually tight schedule for approval relative to the average duration typically expected.
   
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - *Anomaly Detected:* Long average delay of 7 days and high standard deviation (~2 days) indicating variability in notification timing that is atypical given a standardized process flow.
   
3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - *Anomaly Detected:* Average closure time of just 2 hours after assignment, which deviates from the sequence implying potential premature or skipped steps like Evaluate and Approve.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - *Anomaly Detected:* Only 5 minutes average with a 1-minute standard deviation suggesting immediate notification right after evaluation—highly unrealistic without skipping other critical processing steps.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

- **Systemic Delays:** Manual data entry errors or system glitches might cause extended intervals between activities.
- **Automated Steps Skipping Checks:** Some automated processes could be completing tasks too quickly, reducing time stamps to near-zero and thus influencing average times.
- **Resource Bottlenecks:** Certain adjusters or resources might experience delays causing unusual timing patterns.
- **Ad-hoc Interventions:** Irregular process adjustments by supervisors or other factors could artificially extend or shorten intervals.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Unusual Timing:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       claim_id, 
       activity,
       timestamp,
       LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_timestamp,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE claim_id IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT claim_id 
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE (activity, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)) IN (('R', 'A'), ('R', 'E'), ('R', 'P'), ('A', 'C'), ('E', 'N'), ('E', 'C'), ('P', 'N'))
   )
   AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)))) 
       > CASE 
           WHEN activity = 'R' THEN 90000 + 3600 * RANDOM()   -- Example to simulate variability for R to P
           ELSE 600;  -- Adjust based on average profile time
       END;
   ```
   
2. **Correlate Anomalies with Specific Resources:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       resource,
       COUNT(*) AS event_count,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)))) AS avg_time_seconds
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('R', 'A', 'E', 'P', 'N', 'C')
   GROUP BY resource
   HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)))) > (
       SELECT AVG_TIME
       FROM temporal_profile
       WHERE (activity, LAG_ACTIVITY) IN (('R', 'A'), ('R', 'E'), ('R', 'P'), ('A', 'C'), ('E', 'N'), ('E', 'C'), ('P', 'N'))
   )
   ORDER BY avg_time_seconds DESC;
   ```

3. **Filter Specific Claim Patterns:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       claim_id,
       activity,
       timestamp,
       LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_timestamp,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) AS time_diff_seconds
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE claim_id IN (
       SELECT claim_id 
       FROM claim_events 
       WHERE activity = 'C' AND previous_activity = 'P' 
       GROUP BY claim_id HAVING MIN(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)))) < 7200
   )
   ORDER BY time_diff_seconds ASC;
   ```

By executing these queries, specific anomalies in timing can be isolated and further investigated to understand the underlying causes.
