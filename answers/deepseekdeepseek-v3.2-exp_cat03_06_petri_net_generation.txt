Looking at this insurance claim management process, I'll construct a Petri net that captures all the activities, their sequences, and the possible loops for rework. Here's the implementation:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="Insurance_Claim_Management_Process")

# Create places (states between activities)
start = PetriNet.Place(name="start")
after_claim = PetriNet.Place(name="after_claim")
after_registration = PetriNet.Place(name="after_registration")
after_verification = PetriNet.Place(name="after_verification")
docs_complete = PetriNet.Place(name="docs_complete")
after_fraud_check = PetriNet.Place(name="after_fraud_check")
fraud_clear = PetriNet.Place(name="fraud_clear")
after_assessment = PetriNet.Place(name="after_assessment")
after_approval = PetriNet.Place(name="after_approval")
after_payment = PetriNet.Place(name="after_payment")
after_notification = PetriNet.Place(name="after_notification")
end = PetriNet.Place(name="end")

# Add all places to the net
places = [start, after_claim, after_registration, after_verification, docs_complete, 
          after_fraud_check, fraud_clear, after_assessment, after_approval, 
          after_payment, after_notification, end]
for place in places:
    net.places.add(place)

# Create transitions (activities)
claim = PetriNet.Transition(name="claim", label="Insurance_Claim")
registration = PetriNet.Transition(name="registration", label="Claim_Registration")
verification = PetriNet.Transition(name="verification", label="Document_Verification")
fraud_check = PetriNet.Transition(name="fraud_check", label="Fraud_Check")
investigation = PetriNet.Transition(name="investigation", label="In_depth_Investigation")
assessment = PetriNet.Transition(name="assessment", label="Claim_Assessment")
approval = PetriNet.Transition(name="approval", label="Approval")
payment = PetriNet.Transition(name="payment", label="Payment")
notification = PetriNet.Transition(name="notification", label="Notification")
closure = PetriNet.Transition(name="closure", label="Closure")
resubmission = PetriNet.Transition(name="resubmission", label="Re_Document_Submission")

# Add all transitions to the net
transitions = [claim, registration, verification, fraud_check, investigation, 
               assessment, approval, payment, notification, closure, resubmission]
for transition in transitions:
    net.transitions.add(transition)

# Main process flow arcs
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start, claim, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim, after_claim, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_claim, registration, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(registration, after_registration, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_registration, verification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(verification, after_verification, net)

# Document verification flow - can proceed or require resubmission
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_verification, fraud_check, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, after_fraud_check, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_fraud_check, assessment, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(assessment, after_assessment, net)

# Approval path (for claims above threshold)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_assessment, approval, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval, after_approval, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_approval, payment, net)

# Direct payment path (for claims below threshold)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_assessment, payment, net)

# Final steps
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment, after_payment, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_payment, notification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification, after_notification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_notification, closure, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(closure, end, net)

# Document resubmission loop
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_verification, resubmission, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(resubmission, after_registration, net)  # Loop back to re-verification

# Fraud investigation loop
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_fraud_check, investigation, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(investigation, after_fraud_check, net)  # Loop back for re-check

# Set initial and final markings
im = Marking()
im[start] = 1  # Start with one token in the start place

fm = Marking()  
fm[end] = 1    # Final marking has one token in the end place

print("Insurance Claim Management Petri Net created successfully!")
print(f"Initial marking: {im}")
print(f"Final marking: {fm}")
print(f"Number of places: {len(net.places)}")
print(f"Number of transitions: {len(net.transitions)}")
```

This Petri net models the insurance claim management process with the following key features:

1. **Main Process Flow**: Insurance Claim  Claim Registration  Document Verification  Fraud Check  Claim Assessment  (Approval if needed)  Payment  Notification  Closure

2. **Document Resubmission Loop**: After Document Verification, if documents are incomplete, the process can loop back through Re-Document Submission to be verified again.

3. **Fraud Investigation Loop**: After Fraud Check, if doubts arise, an In-depth Investigation can be performed, looping back to Fraud Check for re-evaluation.

4. **Parallel Paths**: After Claim Assessment, claims can either go directly to Payment (for amounts below threshold) or require Approval first (for amounts above threshold).

5. **Proper Start and End**: The process begins with a token in the "start" place and ends with a token in the "end" place.

The Petri net captures all the business logic described in the scenario, including the potential loops for rework and the conditional approval step.
