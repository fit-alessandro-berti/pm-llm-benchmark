Here is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints added to mitigate potential bias in the loan application process, followed by an explanation of the changes.

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # Added: Ensures a fairness check is mandatory in every trace.
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Added: If 'CheckSensitiveAttributes' (e.g., race/gender) occurs, 
        # 'ManualReview' must also occur in the trace to ensure human oversight.
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # Added: A 'FinalDecision' cannot occur until 'BiasMitigationCheck' 
        # has successfully executed.
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {
        # Added: Prevents a 'FinalDecision' from happening immediately after 
        # 'CheckSensitiveAttributes'. There must be an intervening step (like a check).
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    }
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

To reduce the risk of algorithmic or procedural bias, the following logical constraints were introduced:

1.  **`existence`: BiasMitigationCheck**
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint mandates that the activity `BiasMitigationCheck` must appear at least once in every single loan application case. This ensures that no application is processed without explicitly running a fairness or consistency check.

2.  **`coexistence`: CheckSensitiveAttributes $\leftrightarrow$ ManualReview**
    *   **Rationale:** This enforces that if the process involves checking sensitive data (such as `CheckSensitiveAttributes`, representing looking up race, gender, or age), a `ManualReview` must also exist within the same case. This prevents the system from making decisions based solely on sensitive data without human oversight.

3.  **`precedence`: BiasMitigationCheck $\rightarrow$ FinalDecision**
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint requires that `BiasMitigationCheck` occurs *before* `FinalDecision`. It ensures that a decision (Approve/Reject) cannot be finalized unless the mitigation check has already happened, preventing "unchecked" decisions.

4.  **`nonchainsuccession`: CheckSensitiveAttributes $\nrightarrow$ FinalDecision**
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents `FinalDecision` from occurring *immediately* after `CheckSensitiveAttributes`. It eliminates the possibility of a "snap judgment" where the system looks at a sensitive attribute (like race) and immediately outputs a decision. It forces a gap in the process flow, which allows space for the required `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`.
