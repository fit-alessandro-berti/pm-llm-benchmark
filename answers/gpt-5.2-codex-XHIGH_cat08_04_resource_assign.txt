Below is a structured, datadriven approach to analyze and optimize TechSolve’s resource assignment practices using process mining. Each section corresponds to the five requested points and is grounded in ITSM and processmining principles.

---

# **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **a) Resource & Tier Performance Metrics**
Using the event log (case ID, activity, timestamps, resource, tier, skills, priority, category, required skill), calculate:

**Agentlevel metrics**
- **Volume handled:** #tickets worked per agent, by priority/category.
- **Processing time:** avg/median time spent on “Work” activities.
- **Queue time:** time from assignment  work start (per agent).
- **FirstCall Resolution (FCR):** % of tickets resolved at L1 without escalation.
- **Escalation and reassignment rates:** % of cases each agent escalates or reassigns.
- **SLA compliance per agent:** share of cases resolved within SLA by priority.

**Tierlevel metrics**
- **Throughput time by tier** (L1, L2, L3).
- **Queue time per tier** (assignment  start).
- **Escalation rates** (L1L2, L2L3).
- **Resolution success by tier** (cases resolved without handover).

### **b) Process Mining Techniques**
1. **Process discovery & performance overlay**
   - Discover actual flow vs. intended (e.g., roundrobin L1  L2).
   - Overlay waiting times to detect delays after assignment or escalations.

2. **Social Network / HandoverofWork Analysis**
   - Visualize handovers between agents and tiers.
   - Identify frequent handover paths and “handover hubs”.
   - Detect excessive pingpong between specific agents.

3. **Role Discovery**
   - Cluster agents by activities handled and skill requirements.
   - Reveal **actual roles** (e.g., L2 agents doing L1 tasks).
   - Compare “observed” roles with documented tier definitions.

### **c) Skill Utilization Analysis**
- **Skill match ratio:** % of tickets where required skill  agent skills.
- **Overqualification rate:** % of tickets resolved by agents whose skill level exceeds required skill (e.g., L3 handling L1 tasks).
- **Skill demand vs. capacity:** compare volume of tickets requiring skill X vs. available agents with that skill.
- **Performance by skill match:** measure resolution time and SLA outcomes when skill matched vs mismatched.

---

# **2. Identifying ResourceRelated Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **Bottleneck Detection**
- Measure **waiting time between assignment and work start** by tier/skill.
- Identify skills with long queues (e.g., “DBSQL”, “Firewall”)  indicates specialist shortage.
- Detect “busy islands” (agents with high utilization and backlog).

### **Reassignment & Escalation Impact**
- Count **reassignments per case**; compute % cases with 0, 1, 2+ reassignments.
- Quantify **average delay per reassignment** (time between reassignment and next work start).
- Identify common reassignment reasons (skill mismatch, incorrect category).

### **SLA Correlation**
- Use caselevel analysis to correlate **SLA breaches** with:
  - # of handovers,
  - waiting time after assignment,
  - skill mismatch,
  - escalations.
- Example output: “Tickets with 2 reassignments breach SLA in 62% of cases vs 18% with no reassignments.”

### **Under/Over Performance**
- Agents with **high volume + long cycle times**  potential overload.
- Agents with **low workload**  unused capacity or misallocation.

---

# **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **Likely Root Causes**
1. **RoundRobin assignment ignores skill requirements**
   - Leads to reassignments, delays, and specialist overload.
2. **Outdated or incomplete skill profiles**
   - Skills in HR system don’t match real capability (detected in log).
3. **Incorrect ticket categorization / required skill assignment**
   - Wrong “required skill” at creation  wrong routing.
4. **No realtime visibility into workload**
   - Dispatchers assign to already overloaded agents.
5. **Insufficient L1 capability / training**
   - High escalation rate even for “simple” categories.

### **Process Mining Techniques to Validate Causes**
- **Variant analysis:** Compare “happy path” cases (resolved in L1) vs. cases with multiple reassignments.
- **Decision mining:** Model decision points such as:
  - “Escalate vs. resolve”
  - “Assign to Agent X vs Agent Y”
  - Identify attributes causing poor choices (priority, category, timeofday, dispatcher).
- **Conformance checking:** Check deviations from intended assignment logic.

# **4. DataDriven Resource Assignment Strategies**

Below are **four** concrete, datadriven strategies; at least three are required.

---

## **Strategy 1: SkillBased Routing with Proficiency Weighting**
**Issue addressed:** Skill mismatches and frequent reassignments.

**How it works**
- Use mined data to build a **skillproficiency matrix** (skill × agent success rate, resolution time).
- Assign tickets to agents who **match the required skill** and have highest proficiency score.

**Data required**
- Agent skill list + historical resolution performance.
- Required skill attribute per ticket (or predicted).

**Expected benefits**
- Higher firsttimeright assignments.
- Reduced reassignments and SLA breaches.
- Better utilization of specialist skills.

---

## **Strategy 2: WorkloadAware Assignment (Dynamic Load Balancing)**
**Issue addressed:** Uneven workload distribution and queue delays.

**How it works**
- Combine skill match with **realtime workload** (open tickets, WIP, SLA risk).
- Use queue length + agent availability to assign to leastloaded qualified agent.

**Data required**
- Realtime agent availability.
- Current WIP and open queue per agent/tier.
- Historical service time estimates.

**Expected benefits**
- Lower waiting time after assignment.
- More balanced workload and fewer overloads.
- Improved SLA compliance.

---

## **Strategy 3: Predictive Triage / Escalation Optimization**
**Issue addressed:** Excessive L1 escalations and unnecessary delays.

**How it works**
- Use decision mining / ML to predict:
  - Probability of L1 resolution.
  - Required tier (L1 vs L2/L3).
- If predicted L1 success is low, **route directly to L2/L3**.
- If high, keep at L1 or assign to most successful L1 agent in that category.

**Data required**
- Historical resolution outcomes.
- Ticket attributes (category, priority, keywords, channel).
- Escalation history.

**Expected benefits**
- Faster resolution for complex tickets.
- Less wasted L1 effort.
- Reduction in time spent by L2 on trivial tasks.

---

## **Strategy 4: Skills Demand Management & CrossTraining**
**Issue addressed:** Bottlenecks due to scarce skills.

**How it works**
- Use process mining to detect **skills with high demand/low capacity**.
- Crosstrain L1/L2 agents for these skills.
- Create “flex pool” of multiskilled agents that can shift between tiers.

**Data required**
- Skill demand trends (by month/priority/category).
- Training records and skill gap analysis.

**Expected benefits**
- Reduced bottlenecks.
- Better resilience during peaks.
- Greater utilization of underused agents.

# **5. Simulation, Implementation & Monitoring**

### **a) Simulation**
1. Build a **discreteevent simulation** model from mined process:
   - Arrival rates by priority/timeofday.
   - Processing times per tier/skill.
   - Escalation probabilities.
2. Simulate “whatif” scenarios:
   - Skillbased routing vs. roundrobin.
   - Workloadaware assignment.
   - DirecttoL2 routing for predicted complex tickets.
3. Compare KPIs:
   - SLA compliance %
   - Avg resolution time
   - Queue length per tier/skill
   - Resource utilization

### **b) Implementation**
- Embed new assignment rules in the ITSM tool.
- Integrate with skill matrix and workload dashboard.
- Update agent profiles and training plan.

### **c) Continuous Monitoring (Process Mining Dashboards)**
Track these KPIs in real time:

**Assignment & Resource KPIs**
- Skillmatch rate (% of cases assigned to matching skill)
- Reassignment rate
- Average queue time before work start
- Workload distribution (utilization per agent/tier)
- SLA compliance per priority/tier

**Process KPIs**
- Endtoend resolution time
- Escalation frequency (L1L2, L2L3)
- Firstcall resolution rate

**Conformance**
- % assignments following skillbased rule
- Deviations and exceptions (alerts for misassignments)

# **Final Outcome**
By combining process mining with targeted resourceassignment improvements, TechSolve can:
 reduce SLA breaches
