Okay, here's the integrated event log, derived from the provided tables, presented in Markdown format. I've included the optional 'Resource' column and made some assumptions to ensure a complete event log.

**Assumptions:**

1.  **Item Picking as Single Activity:** For simplicity, I've combined all item-picking events for a given order into a single "Items Picked" activity, using the latest picking time. If it was important to track the picking of individual items separately, we would have had one event for each item picked.
2. **Multiple Deliveries**: When multiple delivery records are present, I've added an additional note in the activity name to differentiate the deliveries
3. **Multiple Invoices**:  When multiple invoice records are present, I've added an additional note in the activity name to differentiate the invoices.
4. **Multiple Payments**: I've added an additional note to distinguish between multiple payment records.
5. **No Resource for Order Creation:** The order creation event doesn't have a specific actor in the provided tables. I'm therefore leaving the "Resource" column empty.
6.  **Full Timestamps:**  I'm assuming the timestamps in the database represent the actual times that the activities happened.
7. **Optional columns**: I chose to display the *carrier_id*, *payment_method*, *item_id* and *picker_id* for additional context.

**Event Log Table:**

This log is now formatted for process mining, with each row representing a single event, linked to a case, and chronologically ordered. The 'resource' column will allow to explore how resources are involved in the process flow.
