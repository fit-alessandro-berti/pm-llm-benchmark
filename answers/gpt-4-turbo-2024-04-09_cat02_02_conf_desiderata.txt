**Analysis and Findings:**

**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

- **Case 1:** This case adheres perfectly to the normative process behavior. All the activities are undertaken in the correct sequence and no normative rules are broken.

- **Case 2:** This case has multiple violations of the normative rules:
  - The "Risk Assessment" activity is conducted before the "Credit Check," which contravenes the mandatory sequence where a credit check must precede any risk assessment.
  - "Finalize Documentation" is performed after the loan was rejected. According to the normative rules, document finalization should not occur when the loan is rejected; the case should be closed directly following informing the applicant.

- **Case 3:** No normative rule violations are found in the sequence or execution of activities themselves. All steps are followed as stipulated by the rules for an approved loan case.

**2. Desiderata Failures:**

- **Case 1:** There are no desiderata failures in this case; the timing of all activities seems within reasonable limits based on the standards suggested.

- **Case 2:** Since there's a significant disruption of the normative sequence, it is challenging to evaluate the desiderata independently. However, given the misordered activities, prompt execution and follow-ups might also have been compromised.

- **Case 3:** This case fails to meet specific desiderata conditions:
  - The "Credit Check" was conducted over 24 hours after the "Application Received." This is a deviation from the recommended quick turnaround of 24 hours.
  - The "Inform Applicant" activity was executed more than 48 hours after the "Loan Decision," which goes against the recommendation of informing the applicant within 48 hours.
  - No "Follow-up Call" to the applicant is recorded, which, while not a strict requirement, is recommended for ensuring clear communication and alignment prior to case closure.

**3. Interpretations or Justifications:**

- **Case 2:** The disorder in execution (Risk Assessment before Credit Check, Finalize Documentation despite rejection) might indicate a misunderstanding or miscommunication in process requirements among the staff or perhaps a failure in their process management systems.

- **Case 3:** The delayed activities ("Credit Check" and "Inform Applicant") could be due to resource constraints or scheduling issues, though these are suboptimal. Skipping the "Follow-up Call" could have been due to either an oversight or an underestimation of its importance in facilitating smoother processing and customer satisfaction.

Overall, while Case 1 exemplifies strict adherence to all rules and recommendations, Case 2 shows significant deviations that need immediate attention and corrective action. Case 3, although following the normative rules, falls short on fulfilling the desiderata and suggests room for improvement in timeliness and thoroughness of communication.
