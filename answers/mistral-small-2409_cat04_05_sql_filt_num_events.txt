Certainly! Here is a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases containing more than six events, and returns only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total:

```sql
WITH event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    event_counts ec
ON
    e.case_id = ec.case_id
WHERE
    ec.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Subquery (`event_counts`)**:
   - This subquery calculates the number of events for each `case_id`.
   - `SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count ... GROUP BY case_id` groups the events by `case_id` and counts the number of events for each case.

2. **Main Query**:
   - The main query joins the `event_log` table with the `event_counts` subquery on the `case_id`.
   - The `WHERE ec.event_count <= 6` condition filters out cases that have more than six events, ensuring that only cases with six or fewer events are included in the final result.

This query ensures that only events from cases with a total of six or fewer events are returned.
