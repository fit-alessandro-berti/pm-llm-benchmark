Here's a proposed grouping of the low-level events into higher-level process steps, along with justifications and names:

**1. Material Preparation:**

*   **Events:** Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet.
*   **Justification:** These events all relate to preparing the raw material for the subsequent processing steps. They involve material handling, identification, and pre-processing.  They occur at the beginning of the process and are performed by Operator A and Robot Arm #2.
*   **Name:** Material Preparation

**2. Welding:**

*   **Events:** Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B.
*   **Justification:** These actions are directly related to the core joining process. They involve the use of a specific tool and are performed by Operator B. They are temporally close and represent a distinct phase of adding value to the material.
*   **Name:** Welding

**3. Quality Control:**

*   **Events:** Measure weld integrity, Visual check.
*   **Justification:** These events are focused on verifying the quality of the work performed. They involve different resources (Quality Sensor #1 and Operator C) and assess different aspects of the product. They occur after the welding step, indicating a quality check stage.
*   **Name:** Quality Control

**4. Coating:**

*   **Events:** Apply protective coating, Dry coating.
*   **Justification:** These events relate to applying a protective layer to the product. They involve specific equipment (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2) and are performed consecutively. They represent a distinct finishing stage.
*   **Name:** Coating

**Output Format:**
