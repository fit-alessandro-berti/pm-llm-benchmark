**Assumptions and Notes:**
- The event log is sorted by Case ID and then by Timestamp to reflect chronological order within each case.
- Resource names are mapped from the Resources Table for readability (e.g., SP-001  Alice Brown). For payments, no specific resource is assigned, so the field is left blank.
- Picking events are created per order line (item) as they represent distinct activities with unique timestamps and resources, which is meaningful for process mining to capture potential parallelism or sequencing in picking.
- Delivery events (Dispatched and Arrived) are created per delivery record to handle split shipments (e.g., for order 1002).
- Invoice and payment events are created per record, linked back to the order via invoice_id.
- Order 1004 lacks delivery, invoice, and payment data, so its process instance ends after picking; this is included as-is based on available data.
- No additional events were inferred beyond the provided tables. Timestamps are used directly without summarization, ensuring chronological correctness.
- Other Attributes include relevant details for traceability but are kept concise. Item descriptions from the Products Table were not included as they are not essential for the core process flow.
