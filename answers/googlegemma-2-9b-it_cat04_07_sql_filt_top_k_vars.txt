```sql
WITH ActivitySequence AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
  FROM event_log
),
VariantCounts AS (
  SELECT 
    CASE_ID,
    GROUP_CONCAT(activity ORDER BY seq_num) AS variant
  FROM ActivitySequence
  GROUP BY case_id
)

SELECT
    *
  FROM event_log
  JOIN VariantCounts vc ON event_log.case_id = vc.case_id
WHERE vc.variant IN (
  SELECT variant
  FROM VariantCounts
  ORDER BY COUNT(CASE_ID) DESC
  LIMIT 
)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **ActivitySequence CTE:**
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the row number for each event within a case, based on the `timestamp` order.  
   - The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function assigns a unique sequential number to each activity within a `case_id`.

2. **VariantCounts CTE:**
   - This CTE groups events by `case_id` and uses `GROUP_CONCAT()` to concatenate the activities in their sequential order, effectively creating a string representation of the unique process variant for each case.
 
3. **Final SELECT Statement:**
   - The main query joins the `event_log` table with the `VariantCounts` CTE to link event records with their corresponding variants.
   - It uses a subquery to select the top K variants based on their frequency (number of cases) and filters the `event_log` data to only include events from cases belonging to these top K variants.



**Key Points:**

- **DuckDB's Window Functions:**  The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is crucial for defining the sequential order of activities within each case.
- **String Concatenation:** `GROUP_CONCAT()` allows us to represent the ordered sequences of activity as strings for each variant.
- **Subquery for Variant Filtering:** The subquery within `WHERE` clause efficiently identifies the top K variants based on case counts.
