# 1. What the Process Is Trying to Accomplish

The business is a make-to-order/quote shop: every incoming customer request must be turned into an approved quote and, subsequently, into the internal work that produces a final invoice.

The steps followed to achieve this are organisationally split into:
- **Standard-path work** (owned by a back-office analyst)
- **Custom-path work** (owned by a process-engineer or feasibility team)
- A general approval gate (manager review)
- A final fulfil and close step

The process ends with the customer being informed that the order is "on its way" (or, in the custom path, refused when it is not feasible).

# 3. Role and Meaning of Every Step

### Start
- **Purpose**: Trigger
- **Starting Event**: Usually a customer-originated message (phone, portal, e-mail)

### Receive customer request (Task A)
- **Purpose**: Capture information
- **Outcome document/service order ID that is handed to the downstream logic**
- **Schema**: Contains basic request details and the request-type flag (Standard/Custom)

### Gateway 1 – "Request type?" (XOR)
- **Decision Table**: Ask the "request source" OR "product type" field
- **If Standard**, flow goes to Task B1
- **If Custom**, flow goes to Task B2
- **Important**: Only one of the two outbound flows may be traversed

### Standard Path

#### Task B1 – "Perform Standard Validation"
- **Purpose**: Verify basic order rules (e.g., technical feasibility, credit limit pre-check)
- **Outcome**: Check passed/validation failed
- **If failed** the process usually ends with a quick rejection letter 

#### Gateway 2 – "Run parallel checks" (AND)
- **Purpose**: Splits a single activity (Even though it says "Run parallel checks" it is modelled as one node that can be performed by several teams simultaneously for throughput)
- **Outbound flows**:
  - C1 – Credit Check
  - C2 – Inventory Check
- On arrival of the first completed branch, the process waits; all branches must finish before the next step

#### *Parallel join behaviour*  
- The process waits until the last branch AND the join are satisfied
- No tricky "history" is kept outside of each branch—pure data-driven gateways

#### Task D – "Calculate delivery date"
- **Purpose**: Convert inventory availability and credit limits into a promise date for the customer
- **Inputs taken from both branches C1 and C2**
- **Output** = tentative quotation expiration date
- **Normal path**  ON TO gateway 3

#### Gateway 3 – "Is Manager Approval required?" (XOR)
- **Decision rule**: Because this is a "standard" order and total amount exceeds (or any of) the limit, the company has a rule: **Approval required**
- The model therefore has an **XOR** that waits for the result

#### Task F – "Obtain Manager Approval"
- The manager may be asked by e-mail, mobile approval app or meeting
- **May be rejected after review**  back to the current step and eventually loop

#### Gateway 4 – "Is Approval Granted?" (XOR)
- **YES (approved)**  Task G 
- **NO**  Task H which performs a corrective or safer analysis
  - Re-evaluate credit hold, require additional tendering, etc.
  - **Loop is taken back to Task D** (if the loop originates directly from the "send confirmation" step) or to the "Custom"-side loop if this is a custom path

#### If "No approval needed"
- Customer order can be accepted immediately
- Task G is entered directly, producing the standard quote

### Task G – "Generate Final Invoice"
- Static activity that finalises the quote and sends an invoice or contract
- Leaves the order/integration queue (usually marks the order "commit" in the shop-floor system)

## Ending events  
- **End E1**: The customer is never told no—only if a custom quotation proves impossible
- **End E2**: Standard rejection (lost business).  

# 4. How Custom (Feasibility) Steps Differ from Standard

Feasibility work is conducted first:
- **B2**: Analyse the customer's "field-defined" or "bespoke product" request
- **Gate 5**: Splits into
  - **Feasible**  then go straight to E1 (prepare quotation)
  - **Not feasible**  E2 (send fast rejection notice)
- Once feasibility is proved, the rest of the process (Gateways 3-4 and Task G) is identical to the Standard branch, because same downstream approvals and invoicing apply

**Key difference**: Custom customers may (1) receive a "We will review and quote you back within 5 days" message, while Standard customers might get an immediate automatic quote. The wording and SLA differ, but control-flow logic is almost indistinguishable.

# 5. Feedback / Re-work Loops

- **H  Back to Task E1** in the Custom flow: This is where the feasibility team is asked to "re-quote" or "re-model" the request with different performance/price targets.
- **H  Back to Task D** in the Standard flow: When the credit group or logistics discovers a new restriction after the quote was presented, they send the quote back to the salesman to show the customer alternative delivery dates/price options.
- Loop back **X** instructions have **Iteration Type "while loop"**: the manager's re-evaluation only happens once—after the manager decides to **reject** you still stay in the **"re-work"** branch, not in a Y-controlling, constant loop. Once H completes, the process returns to the correct predecessor (E1 or D) and proceeds once again through the same list of steps.

# 6. Gateway Types Explained

- **XOR (exclusive gateway)**: One and only one outgoing sequence must be taken. Used when the decision is mutually exclusive (request type, approval needed)
- **AND (parallel gateway)**: All incoming flows must happen before the tokens merge; the diagram literally "splits and then later converges"
- **Implicit Start/End Events**: Good practice; no gateway in the explicit model

### Important Separation:
**Approve / Not-Approve** and **Credit Re-evaluate** each have their own individual gateways, allowing the flow to either skip an approval or to loop once for re-work—illustrated by the explicit **exit edge of Gateway 4 or 2**.

# 7. Summary of Process Flow by Scenario

### Scenario 1 – Standard Request
1. Receive request  validate  parallel checks  delivery date  
2.  Approval required?  
    Yes  Manager approves (or re-loop)  Invoice  
    No approval  invoice  
3. Send Confirmation  

### Scenario 2 – Custom Request  
1. Feasibility study  
    Feasible  Build quotation  
    Not  Reject  
2. Same downstream path as Scenario 1, including possible reprieve when the Manager temporarily rejects the quotation and asks for re-work  

In both paths the **final invoice** remains the "single function" that converts the approved quote into downstream production execution.
