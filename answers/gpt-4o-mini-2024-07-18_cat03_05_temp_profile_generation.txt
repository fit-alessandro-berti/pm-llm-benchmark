Here's a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the given activities and their relationships in the global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (43200, 7200),  # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('SS', 'RC'): (86400, 14400),  # Supplier Selection to Receive Components
    ('OP', 'RC'): (86400, 18000),  # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 3600),   # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (7200, 1800),     # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (3600, 600),      # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (5400, 1200),     # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 1200),     # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 28800),   # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (43200, 7200),    # Distribution to After-Sales Support
    ('OP', 'Q'): (86400, 14400),    # Order Placement to Quality Inspection
    ('CA', 'WS'): (86400, 8640),    # Component Assembly to Warehouse Storage
    ('RC', 'CA'): (14400, 1800),     # Receive Components to Component Assembly
    ('QI', 'PT'): (7200, 1200),      # Quality Inspection to Product Testing
    ('PK', 'DT'): (18000, 3600),     # Packaging to Distribution
    ('PT', 'AS'): (21600, 4320),     # Product Testing to After-Sales Support
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each key is a tuple representing a pair of activities where the first activity can lead to the second one, either directly or indirectly through other steps.
- The values are tuples containing the estimated average time (in seconds) between the two activities and the standard deviation of those times.
- The estimated times take into account various practical considerations of a global supply chain, such as supplier lead times, production speed, and efficiency in distribution.
