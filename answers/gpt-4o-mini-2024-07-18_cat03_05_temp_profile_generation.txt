Here is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for a complex global supply chain process involving various activities. Each pair of activities is associated with an estimated average time (in seconds) and standard deviation (in seconds):

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 14400),       # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('SS', 'RC'): (172800, 28800),      # Supplier Selection to Receive Components
    ('OP', 'RC'): (43200, 7200),        # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),       # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (3600, 1800),         # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (7200, 3600),         # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (1800, 600),          # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1200),         # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),       # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 86400),       # Distribution to After-Sales Support
    ('SS', 'QI'): (172800, 43200),      # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection
    ('OP', 'QI'): (129600, 21600),      # Order Placement to Quality Inspection
    ('CA', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),         # Component Assembly to Packaging
    ('PK', 'DT'): (3600, 600),          # Packaging to Distribution
    ('AS', 'DT'): (43200, 21600),       # After-Sales Support to Distribution
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Pairs of Activities**: The keys in the dictionary are tuples representing different pairs of activities that can follow each other in the supply chain process.
- **Average Time and Standard Deviation**: Each value is a tuple containing the estimated average time between the activities and the standard deviation. The average times have been estimated based on the complexity and nature of the individual activities along with their expected delays in a global supply chain. The standard deviation represents the variability around the average time expected due to factors like supplier reliability, production capacity, and logistics.
- **Complexity**: The dictionary captures both direct successors as well as pairs that follow each other with intermediate activities. This captures the tendency in supply chains where certain activities are temporally linked even though they may not be immediately adjacent in the process execution.
