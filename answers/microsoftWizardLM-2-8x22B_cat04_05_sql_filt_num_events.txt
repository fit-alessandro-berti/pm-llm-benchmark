 To accomplish the task described, we need to perform the following steps in our SQL query:

1. Calculate the total number of events for each `case_id`.
2. Filter out `case_id`s that have more than six events.
3. Return all events for the `case_id`s that have six or fewer events.

Here is the SQL query that would achieve this in DuckDB:

```sql
WITH EventCounts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN EventCounts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE c.event_count <= 6;
```

Explanation of the query:

- The `WITH` clause is used to create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `EventCounts`. This CTE calculates the total number of events (`event_count`) for each `case_id` by using the `COUNT(*)` aggregate function and grouping by `case_id`.
- The main query selects all columns from the `event_log` table (aliased as `e`) and joins it with the `EventCounts` CTE on the `case_id`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters out the cases (`case_id`) where the total event count is greater than six, thus only including cases with six or fewer events.
- The result of the query is all events from the `event_log` table that belong to cases meeting the specified condition.

This query will return the desired output, which is the full set of events for cases that have a total of six or fewer events.
