To address the task, we need to carefully analyze the event log and identify activities that appear multiple times within the same case. We will then rename these activities to reflect their contextual differences based on their position in the process and the associated context.

### Step-by-Step Analysis and Renaming

1. **Identify Recurring Activities:**
   - **Verify Documents:** Appears in all three cases.
   - **Call Customer:** Appears in all three cases.
   - **Adjust Account:** Appears in cases C002 and C003.

2. **Rename Activities Based on Context:**
   - **Verify Documents:**
     - **Initial Verification:** The first occurrence of "Verify Documents" in each case.
     - **Re-Verification:** The second occurrence of "Verify Documents" in each case.
   - **Call Customer:**
     - **Initial Call:** The first occurrence of "Call Customer" in each case.
     - **Follow-Up Call:** The second occurrence of "Call Customer" in each case.
   - **Adjust Account:**
     - **Initial Adjustment:** The occurrence of "Adjust Account" in case C002.
     - **Corrective Adjustment:** The occurrence of "Adjust Account" in case C003.

### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Initial Verification vs. Re-Verification:**
   - **Initial Verification:** This activity occurs first in the process flow, typically when the documents are first checked.
   - **Re-Verification:** This activity occurs after additional information is provided (e.g., ID scan) or after an adjustment is made, ensuring that the documents are checked again for completeness.

2. **Initial Call vs. Follow-Up Call:**
   - **Initial Call:** This activity is the first contact made to the customer, often to gather more information or clarify issues.
   - **Follow-Up Call:** This activity is a subsequent contact made to confirm previous actions or to address any remaining issues.

3. **Initial Adjustment vs. Corrective Adjustment:**
   - **Initial Adjustment:** This activity is the first adjustment made to the account details, typically based on initial information.
   - **Corrective Adjustment:** This activity is a correction made after identifying missing or incorrect information, often due to a previous call or verification step.

By renaming the activities in this manner, we ensure that each activity's name clearly reflects its role and context within the process flow, making the log easier to understand and analyze.
