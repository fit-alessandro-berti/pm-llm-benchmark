Here are the opposing, general, and opposite concepts for each of the given Petri net concepts:

* **Source Place**: Opposing concept: Sink Place; General concept: Place (a node that can hold tokens)
	+ A Source Place is a special type of place that always has at least one token. The opposing concept, Sink Place, would be a place that always has no tokens.
	+ The general concept, Place, encompasses both Source and Sink Places, as well as other types of places that can hold different numbers of tokens.
* **Immediate Transition**: Opposing concept: Delayed Transition; General concept: Transition (a directed arc with input and output places)
	+ An Immediate Transition is a transition that fires instantly when all its input places have at least one token. The opposing concept, Delayed Transition, would be a transition that does not fire immediately, but only after some delay or condition is met.
	+ The general concept, Transition, refers to any directed arc with input and output places, regardless of the firing conditions.
* **Live Transition**: Opposing concept: Dead Transition; General concept: Transition (a directed arc with input and output places)
	+ A Live Transition is a transition that can fire at least once. The opposing concept, Dead Transition, would be a transition that cannot fire under any circumstances.
	+ The general concept, Transition, encompasses both live and dead transitions, as well as other types of transitions that may have different properties or behaviors.
* **Bounded Net**: Opposing concept: Unbounded Net; General concept: Petri Net (a formal model for concurrent systems)
	+ A Bounded Net is a Petri net with a finite number of tokens. The opposing concept, Unbounded Net, would be a Petri net that can have an unlimited number of tokens.
	+ The general concept, Petri Net, refers to the abstract mathematical structure and its various types, including bounded and unbounded nets.
* **Free Choice Net**: Opposing concept: Deterministic Net; General concept: Petri Net (a formal model for concurrent systems)
	+ A Free Choice Net is a Petri net where each transition has multiple input places and can fire when any of them have at least one token. The opposing concept, Deterministic Net, would be a Petri net where each transition has exactly one input place.
	+ The general concept, Petri Net, encompasses both free choice and deterministic nets, as well as other types of nets that may have different properties or behaviors.

Note that these opposing concepts are not necessarily formal definitions, but rather intuitive interpretations of the original concepts. Additionally, some of these opposing concepts might be more relevant in certain contexts or applications than others.
