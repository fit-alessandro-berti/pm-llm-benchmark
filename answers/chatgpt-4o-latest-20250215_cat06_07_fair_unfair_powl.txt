Here are the two POWL models based on the hiring process at **GlobalTeq Solutions**.  

---

### **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**
This model introduces **bias** by implementing an XOR split after the skill assessment. Some applicants go through a **standard cultural fit evaluation**, while others (who are affiliated with a known local group) take a different path where they receive a **preferential boost** in their evaluation.  

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define process steps
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # This step introduces bias
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for missing information
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Introduce XOR split - Either standard cultural fit check or biased community-based path
xor_cultural_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_affiliation])

# Define partial order
unfair_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, data_loop, skill_assessment, xor_cultural_check, manager_review, final_decision])

# Define execution order
unfair_process.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
unfair_process.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
unfair_process.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_cultural_check)
unfair_process.order.add_edge(xor_cultural_check, manager_review)
unfair_process.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

### **POWL Model Without Unfairness**  
This version **removes bias** by ensuring that all applicants go through the same **cultural fit evaluation** after the skill assessment, with no separate branch for preferential treatment.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, Transition, OperatorPOWL
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define process steps
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Everyone goes through the same evaluation
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for missing information
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Define partial order (without biased branching)
fair_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, data_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit, manager_review, final_decision])

# Define execution order
fair_process.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
fair_process.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
fair_process.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit)
fair_process.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
fair_process.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

### **Key Differences:**
| Aspect                 | **POWL Model with Unfairness** | **POWL Model Without Unfairness** |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Cultural Fit Check** | XOR branch (biased option for affiliated candidates) | Single path for all candidates |
| **Bias Source**        | Community affiliation gives an implicit advantage | No special consideration for affiliations |
| **Fairness**           | Subtle preference based on background | Equal evaluation for all candidates |

Would you like me to refine any part of the models further? ðŸ˜Š
