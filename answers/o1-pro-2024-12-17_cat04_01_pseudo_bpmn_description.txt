Below is a detailed walkthrough of the business process as represented by the pseudo-BPMN flow. The explanation will cover the purpose of each step, the role of each gateway, the convergence of different paths, the conditions for looping back, and how tasks differ for standard versus custom customer requests.

---

### Overall Business Context

The depicted process appears to describe a customer order or service request handling procedure. It starts when a request is received from a customer and then guides the organization through validation, feasibility checks, parallel verifications, and potential approval steps before finalizing the order and confirming it back to the customer.

---

### Start Event

- **Start Event**: This indicates the beginning of the process. The process is initiated by the arrival of a customer request.

---

### Initial Steps

1. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**  
   **Purpose:** The organization receives an incoming customer request, logs it into the system, and begins the evaluation process. This could involve reading the order details, confirming the requested products or services, and verifying that the request is properly recorded.

---

### Decision on Request Type

2. **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"**  
   **Meaning:** This is an exclusive decision gateway. The process checks whether the customer request falls into a "standard" category—perhaps a typical, off-the-shelf order—or a "custom" request that requires special handling. Only one of these paths will be taken.

   - **If Type = Standard**: The process follows the Standard path.
   - **If Type = Custom**: The process follows the Custom path.

---

### Standard Request Path

If the request is standard:

3. **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**  
   **Purpose:** On this path, the company conducts routine checks to ensure the request is valid. For example, verifying the customer’s account status, ensuring the requested products are part of the standard catalog, and confirming that the order details meet predefined criteria.

4. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**  
   **Meaning:** This is a parallel split gateway. It initiates multiple tasks that must be completed concurrently or in no particular sequential order. Both subsequent tasks must start and finish before proceeding.

   - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**  
     **Purpose:** The company verifies the customer’s creditworthiness—ensuring there are no outstanding debts or credit limit issues that would prevent fulfilling the order.

   - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**  
     **Purpose:** The company checks product availability. It ensures that the requested items are in stock or can be delivered by the requested timeline.

5. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**  
   **Meaning:** Once both the Credit Check (C1) and Inventory Check (C2) complete, the process flow converges at an AND-join. This ensures that the subsequent tasks only proceed after all parallel validations are done.

6. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**  
   **Purpose:** After confirming credit and inventory, the company calculates an accurate delivery date. This could consider warehouse dispatch times, shipping schedules, and any lead times needed for order fulfillment.

---

### Custom Request Path

If the request is custom:

3. **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**  
   **Purpose:** Instead of standard validation, the company needs to determine if a custom product or service is feasible. This may involve assessing special materials, customization lead times, engineering feasibility, or specialized supplier inputs.

4. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**  
   **Meaning:** This exclusive decision gateway checks if the custom request can actually be met under current capabilities and resources.

   - **If Yes (Feasible)**:  
     **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**  
     **Purpose:** Since the customization can be done, the company prepares a detailed, often itemized quotation, including additional costs, extended lead times, and any special contractual terms.

   - **If No (Not Feasible)**:  
     **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**  
     **Purpose:** If the customization cannot be provided, the customer is informed that the request will be rejected. The process then moves to the **End Event** for this particular branch, concluding with a formal rejection communication.

---

### Convergence After Standard or Custom Tasks

After the Standard (D: Calculate Delivery Date) or Custom (E1: Prepare Custom Quotation) tasks are completed, both paths converge. Note that if the request was standard and feasible, you now have a calculated delivery date; if custom and feasible, you have a custom quotation.

At this point, the process moves forward to determine if any additional authorization is needed before finalizing.

---

### Approval Determination

7. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**  
   **Meaning:** This decision checks internal policies or thresholds. Certain orders—especially custom, high-value, or large-volume orders—may require managerial or higher-level approval before issuing a final invoice.

   - **If Yes (Approval Needed)**:
     **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**  
     **Purpose:** The request is forwarded to a manager or an approval authority. They review the details—price, feasibility, terms—and decide whether to greenlight the order or request changes.

   - **If No (No Approval Needed)**:
     Skip directly to Task G: "Generate Final Invoice," since no further authorization is required.

---

### Handling the Approval Result

If approval was needed:

8. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**  
   **Meaning:** Another exclusive decision determines whether the manager approves the request.

   - **If Yes (Approval Granted)**:
     **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**  
     **Purpose:** With approval in place, the company now prepares the official invoice for the order, reflecting final pricing, terms, and delivery information.

   - **If No (Approval Not Granted)**:
     **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**  
     **Purpose:** The approver may have identified issues: prices too high, lead times too long, or conditions not met. The process must revisit previous steps to adjust terms or conditions.

     After re-evaluation, the process:
     - Loops back to **Task E1** if the request was a custom order (meaning the quotation or customization details need revision).
     - Loops back to **Task D** if it was a standard order (meaning delivery date or some standard condition needs to be recalculated or adjusted).

     This loop allows the organization to refine the offer and request approval again, aiming to meet the approver’s requirements.

---

### Final Steps

After generating the final invoice (Task G), the process moves forward:

9. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**  
   **Purpose:** The customer is now informed that their order has been accepted, finalized, and is moving forward. This confirmation typically includes the confirmed delivery date (for standard orders) or the final approved custom quotation.

**End Event**  
The process concludes once the customer confirmation is sent or, in the case of a rejected customization request, once the rejection notice is issued.

---

### Key Differences: Standard vs. Custom Requests

- **Standard Requests:**  
  Involve routine validations (credit and inventory checks) and a straightforward calculation of delivery date. Fewer complexities and usually less dependency on feasibility analysis.

- **Custom Requests:**  
  Require a custom feasibility analysis to determine if the request can be accommodated. If feasible, a custom quotation is prepared. This path is more complex and tailored. If not feasible, a rejection is issued immediately.

---

### Conditions for Approvals and Rework

- **Approval Needed:**  
  If the order, whether standard or custom, meets criteria that require higher-level sign-off (e.g., order above a certain monetary value, special terms, or resource-intensive customization), the process routes through the approval stage.

- **Rework Steps Triggered When Approval is Denied:**  
  If an approver rejects the order conditions, the process does not end. Instead, it loops back to either:
  - **Task E1 (Custom Path)**: To revise the custom quotation terms, pricing, or feasibility details.
  - **Task D (Standard Path)**: To possibly adjust delivery dates, terms, or pricing for standard orders.

This iterative cycle continues until approval is granted or, in some scenarios, until the organization decides to terminate the request altogether.

---

### Path Convergence

- **After Parallel Checks (for standard)**: The AND-join ensures that both the credit and inventory checks have completed before calculating a delivery date.
  
- **After Custom/Standard Divergence**: Eventually, both the standard and custom paths lead to a common decision point regarding approval needs. This unifies the process flows after their respective validation and feasibility steps.

---

### Summary

The provided pseudo-BPMN flow lays out a structured, decision-driven process that bifurcates based on request type (standard vs. custom), includes parallel validations for standard orders, conducts feasibility checks for custom orders, and requires possible approvals. If approvals are denied, the process supports iterative rework loops to meet conditions before finalizing the order. Ultimately, all successful flows end with a final invoice and confirmation to the customer.
