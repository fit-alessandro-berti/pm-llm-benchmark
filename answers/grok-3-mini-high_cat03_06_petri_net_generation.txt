<think>
First, I need to construct an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process described. An accepting Petri net has an initial marking and a final marking. The initial marking starts with a token in a start place, and the final marking has a token in an end place.

Key elements from the scenario:

- Activities: C (Insurance Claim), CR (Claim Registration), DV (Document Verification), FC (Fraud Check), CA (Claim Assessment), AP (Approval), P (Payment), N (Notification), CL (Closure), RDS (Re-Document Submission), II (In-depth Investigation).

The process starts with C, but C is the event of filing the claim, so the Petri net should start after the claim is filed. Looking back: "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which the following steps take place:" So C is the starting point, but in the Petri net, it might be represented as the first transition or perhaps as a place. Typically in Petri nets for processes, places represent states, and transitions represent activities.

From the prompt's example, places are like "source" and "sink", and transitions are activities. So I should have places that represent the states between activities.

Let me outline the sequence:

- Start: After claim is filed, it should go to Claim Registration.

The description says: "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which..." so C might be the trigger, but in the Petri net, we can have a start place that leads to C as a transition.

To make it clear, I'll have a start place, then a transition for C (filing the claim), but the description lists C as part of the process. Re-reading: "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which the following steps take place: 1. CR, 2. DV, etc." So C is the filing, and then CR is the first step. But in the list, C is mentioned, so probably C should be included as a transition.

To be precise, I'll include all mentioned activities as transitions.

Standard sequence without loops:

C  CR  DV  FC  CA  AP  P  N  CL

But with possible loops:

- After DV, if documents incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV.

- After FC, if doubts, go to II, then back to FC (can happen multiple times).

Also, AP is only if the amount surpasses a threshold, but the description says "the claim must be approved... if the amount surpasses", but it doesn't specify what happens if it doesn't. Probably, if no approval needed, it might skip AP or something, but the description doesn't explicitly say. To keep it simple, I'll assume that AP is always done, or perhaps make it conditional, but in Petri nets, conditionals are handled by the structure.

The description: "The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So it's conditional. But in a basic Petri net, we don't have guards, so I need to model it with places that allow or not the transition.

To simplify, perhaps I can assume that AP is always part of the path, or add a choice.

But the task is to model the described process, so I should include the possibilities.

For the loops: DV can loop with RDS, and FC can loop with II.

Also, the end is P  N  CL, and final marking at CL or after.

The final marking should represent a closed claim, so probably a place after CL.

In Petri nets for workflows, often there are places before and after transitions.

Let me define places that represent the states.

Possible places:

- Start place (with token initially)

- After C, before CR? Or combine.

Better to have transitions for activities, and places in between.

So:

- Place: p_start (initial marking)

- Transition: t_C (Insurance Claim)

- Arc from p_start to t_C

- Place: p_after_C (or perhaps directly to CR)

After t_C, it should go to CR.

Perhaps:

- p_start  t_C  p_registered  t_CR  p_verified  etc.

t_C is the filing, which might not be necessary if we start from CR, but since it's listed, I'll include it.

To match the description, start from C.

Define the main path:

p_start  t_C  p_claim_filed  t_CR  p_claim_registered  t_DV  p_documents_verified  t_FC  p_fraud_checked  t_CA  p_claim_assessed  t_AP  p_approved  t_P  p_paid  t_N  p_notified  t_CL  p_end

But with loops.

For the DV loop: after t_DV, if documents incomplete, it might go to t_RDS, then back to t_DV.

So, after p_documents_verified? No.

Typically, after a transition like DV, we have a place, and from that place, depending on the outcome, different transitions can fire.

In standard Petri nets without inhibitors, we use places to model choices.

So for DV: after DV is done, there might be a place that has tokens, and then transitions for "continue if verified" or "go to RDS".

But DV is the verification activity, so perhaps:

- From p_before_DV  t_DV  and then to a place that indicates the state after DV.

After DV, if verified, go to FC, else go to RDS.

RDS is re-submission, then probably back to DV.

So, better to have:

- Place: p_ready_for_DV

- Transition: t_DV

- After t_DV, arc to a place p_DV_outcome

But p_DV_outcome could split: one arc to p_verified_good (leading to FC), another to p_verified_bad (leading to RDS).

In Petri nets, a place can have multiple outgoing arcs to different transitions, but the transition that fires depends on which is enabled. Since it's a choice based on data, in workflow nets, we often use multiple arcs from a place.

Standard way is to have a place after an activity, and from that place, multiple transitions can be possible, but only one should fire based on the process logic. In Petri net simulation, it might nondeterministically choose, but for modeling, it's ok.

To model the choice explicitly, I can have two places after DV or use a pattern.

A common way is:

- t_DV fires, produces a token in p_after_DV

- From p_after_DV, there is an arc to t_FC if verified, but since we can't have conditions, perhaps have two transitions from p_after_DV: one for "verified" and one for "not verified", but transitions should be labeled with activities.

Perhaps better to model RDS as a separate path.

Let me think of the flow:

From t_CR  p_after_CR  t_DV  after DV, if good, to t_FC, if bad, to t_RDS  then after RDS, back to t_DV.

So in Petri net:

- Place: p_after_CR

- Transition: t_DV

- Arc from p_after_CR to t_DV

- After t_DV, need to go to different places.

Transition t_DV consumes a token from p_after_CR and produces tokens in output places.

I can have t_DV with two output places: p_verified_good and p_verified_bad.

Then from p_verified_good  arc to t_FC

From p_verified_bad  arc to t_RDS

Then t_RDS  output to p_after_RDS, and arc from p_after_RDS to t_DV (back to verification)

After t_RDS, it should go back to DV, so perhaps t_RDS outputs to a place that is input to t_DV, or directly.

Better to have a place between.

Define:

- After t_DV, if good, go to p_ready_for_FC

- If bad, go to p_need_resubmission

Then from p_need_resubmission  t_RDS  p_after_RDS  back to p_ready_for_DV? No.

t_DV should have input from a place that represents ready for DV.

So let's define the places as states before activities.

Standard way in workflow Petri nets is to have places representing the state where an activity is enabled.

So:

- p_start (initial)

- t_C: input p_start, output p_claim_filed

- t_CR: input p_claim_filed, output p_ready_for_DV

- t_DV: input p_ready_for_DV, but output depends.

For choices, we can have the transition output to different places.

So for t_DV: input from p_ready_for_DV, output to p_documents_verified (which then leads to FC) or to p_documents_incomplete.

But a transition can have multiple output places, so when t_DV fires, it can produce tokens in multiple places, but typically for exclusive choices, we model it with the transition having multiple possible outputs, but in standard Petri nets, when a transition fires, it adds tokens to all output places. That might not be correct for exclusive OR.

In basic Petri nets, there's no built-in exclusive OR; it's modeled by having the place have multiple outgoing transitions, and the choice is nondeterministic.

For this modeling purpose, it's acceptable to have nondeterministic choice, meaning the process can go either way depending on which transition is fired.

So for the DV part:

- Place: p_ready_for_DV

- Transition: t_DV (label "Document Verification")

- Output from t_DV to two places: p_verified_ok and p_verified_not_ok

- From p_verified_ok  transition t_FC (but t_FC should be after fraud check is enabled)

Better:

From p_verified_ok  arc to input of t_FC

From p_verified_not_ok  arc to input of t_RDS

Then t_RDS (label "Re-Document Submission")  output to p_ready_for_DV (back to verification)

Similarly for FC and II.

After t_FC, if no fraud or cleared, go to CA, else go to II, and II might lead back to FC.

Description: "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)."

So similar loop.

t_FC output to p_fraud_cleared or p_fraud_doubt

From p_fraud_cleared  to t_CA

From p_fraud_doubt  to t_II  then back to t_FC or to p_ready_for_FC again.

Probably back to FC to re-check.

So t_II output to p_ready_for_FC or directly to t_FC input.

Define p_ready_for_FC as a place.

Now for the AP part: "Approval (AP) if the amount surpasses a certain threshold."

This is conditional. In Petri nets, to model this, I could have a choice after CA.

After t_CA, depending on the assessment, either go directly to P or go to AP then P.

But again, without conditions, I can model it as a choice: from p_after_CA, two possible transitions: t_AP or t_direct_to_P, but that might not be accurate.

Since AP is an activity that might or might not happen, I can have a place after CA, and from there, either t_AP or a transition for "no approval needed" leading to P.

But the activities listed don't have a "no approval" activity, so perhaps just have the possibility.

To keep it simple, and since the task might expect a basic model, I'll include AP as part of the path, or add a choice.

I am considering that after CA, there's always a decision, but model it with two paths.

Define:

After t_CA, output to p_assessed

From p_assessed, two transitions: t_AP (if approval needed) and t_no_AP or something, but better to label the transition properly.

Perhaps have a transition t_decide_approval, but that's not an activity.

Since the activities are given, perhaps assume AP is always done, or model the choice with unlabeled transitions, but transitions should be labeled with activities.

In pm4py, transitions can have labels, so I'll use the activity names.

For simplicity, I'll model it as: after CA, always go to AP, then to P, assuming the condition is handled externally. But the description says "if the amount surpasses", so it's conditional.

To make the Petri net correct, I should model the possibility of skipping AP.

So, from p_after_CA, have two outgoing arcs: one to t_AP and one to t_P_direct or something.

But t_P_direct isn't an activity; P is Payment.

Perhaps have a transition for "Assess and Decide" but it's not specified.

I can have t_CA output to two places: p_approval_needed and p_no_approval_needed.

Then from p_approval_needed  t_AP  p_approved  t_P

From p_no_approval_needed  t_P directly.

But again, the choice is nondeterministic.

For this task, it's acceptable.

Now, the end part is straightforward: after P  t_N  t_CL  p_end

Description: P  N  CL

And final marking at p_end or after CL.

Also, the initial marking at p_start.

Now, for the loops, they can happen multiple times, so the structure allows that.

Let me list all places and transitions.

First, main path places:

- p_start

- After t_C: p_after_C

- After t_CR: p_after_CR

- For DV loop: p_ready_for_DV, p_verified_ok, p_verified_not_ok

p_verified_not_ok leads to t_RDS, which leads back.

Define minimal places.

Transitions: t_C, t_CR, t_DV, t_RDS, t_FC, t_II, t_CA, t_AP, t_P, t_N, t_CL

Places:

- Start: p_start

- Between activities: need places to connect them with the loops.

Define:

- p_start  t_C  p_claim_filed  t_CR  p_registered  t_DV  [output to p_verified and p_not_verified?]

Better:

Set input and output for each transition.

- t_C: input p_start, output p_ready_for_CR (or directly p_claim_filed, but let's use descriptive names)

Use simple names.

Define places as: the state before each activity, but with branches.

- p_start (initial)

- t_C (Insurance Claim): input p_start, output p_after_C

- t_CR (Claim Registration): input p_after_C, output p_ready_for_DV

- Now for DV and RDS loop.

Have a place p_ready_for_DV

t_DV input: p_ready_for_DV, output: two places - p_documents_ok and p_documents_not_ok

From p_documents_ok  t_FC? But t_FC needs its own input place.

Better to have p_documents_ok as input to t_FC.

Similarly, from p_documents_not_ok  t_RDS

t_RDS input: p_documents_not_ok, output: back to p_ready_for_DV (so it can be re-verified)

Similarly for FC and II.

After t_DV outputs to p_documents_ok, which is input to t_FC.

t_FC input: p_ready_for_FC, but if p_documents_ok is the place before FC, call it p_ready_for_FC.

Redefine.

Set p_after_DV_verified as p_ready_for_FC.

So:

- t_DV output: p_verified_ok  which is same as p_ready_for_FC

And p_verified_not_ok  t_RDS input.

t_RDS output: to a place that is input to t_DV, so p_ready_for_DV.

t_DV input is p_ready_for_DV, which is output from t_CR and from t_RDS.

Yes.

Similarly for FC.

After t_FC, output to p_fraud_cleared or p_fraud_doubt

From p_fraud_cleared  p_ready_for_CA

From p_fraud_doubt  t_II

t_II input: p_fraud_doubt, output: back to p_ready_for_FC (to re-check fraud)

t_FC input should be p_ready_for_FC.

So define p_ready_for_FC as the input place for t_FC.

After t_DV, if verified ok, output to p_ready_for_FC

If not, to p_documents_not_ok  t_RDS  output to p_ready_for_DV

t_RDS should output back to p_ready_for_DV so that DV can be done again.

Now for FC similar.

p_ready_for_FC is output from t_DV (when ok) and from t_II (after investigation)

t_FC input: p_ready_for_FC, output: p_fraud_cleared and p_fraud_doubt? No, output to two places: p_cleared for CA, and p_doubt for II.

So t_FC output: p_fraud_cleared and p_fraud_not_cleared (or p_fraud_doubt)

From p_fraud_cleared  to p_ready_for_CA

From p_fraud_not_cleared  to t_II

t_II input: p_fraud_not_cleared, output: back to p_ready_for_FC (to re-do fraud check)

After the loops, to CA.

Now for CA and AP.

After p_fraud_cleared  p_ready_for_CA  t_CA  now, output depending on approval needed.

t_CA output: to p_approval_needed or p_no_approval

From p_approval_needed  t_AP  p_approved

From p_no_approval  p_approved (same place, or directly to next)

Better to have t_CA output to two places: p_needs_approval and p_no_need_approval

From p_needs_approval  t_AP  p_after_approval

From p_no_need_approval  p_after_approval (directly)

Then from p_after_approval  t_P  p_paid  t_N  p_notified  t_CL  p_end

And p_end is the final place.

Now, initial marking: token in p_start

Final marking: token in p_end

Now, need to define all places and transitions in code.

Also, use pm4py classes.

From the example, we create PetriNet, add places, transitions, arcs.

Places and transitions have names.

In the marking, we use the place objects.

So in code, I'll create net = PetriNet("insurance_claim")

Then create places: source-like and sink-like.

List all places:

- p_start

- p_after_C  (after Insurance Claim)

- p_after_CR (after Claim Registration)

- p_ready_for_DV

- p_verified_ok

- p_verified_not_ok

- p_ready_for_FC  (same as output when verified ok)

p_verified_ok can be p_ready_for_FC

Similarly, p_verified_not_ok

For FC:

- p_ready_for_FC (input to t_FC)

- p_fraud_cleared

- p_fraud_not_cleared

Then t_II

For CA:

- p_ready_for_CA (output from p_fraud_cleared)

- p_needs_approval

- p_no_need_approval

- p_after_approval (input to t_P)

To reduce places, p_fraud_cleared can directly be input to t_CA, so call it p_ready_for_CA

Similarly.

Define minimal places.

Places:

1. p_start

2. p_after_C  // after t_C

3. p_after_CR  // after t_CR, ready for DV

4. p_ready_for_DV  // same as p_after_CR? No, p_after_CR can be p_ready_for_DV

After t_CR, it's ready for DV, so perhaps no need for separate p_after_CR, can be directly p_ready_for_DV.

After filing C, it's ready for CR.

Refine.

- p_start  t_C  p_ready_for_CR

- t_CR  p_ready_for_DV

Then for DV loop:

t_DV input: p_ready_for_DV, output: p_documents_verified_ok and p_documents_verified_not_ok

From p_documents_verified_ok  p_ready_for_FC

From p_documents_verified_not_ok  p_need_resubmission

t_RDS input: p_need_resubmission, output: p_ready_for_DV  // back to DV

Similarly for FC:

t_FC input: p_ready_for_FC, output: p_fraud_cleared and p_fraud_not_cleared

From p_fraud_cleared  p_ready_for_CA

From p_fraud_not_cleared  p_need_investigation

t_II input: p_need_investigation, output: p_ready_for_FC  // back to FC

Then for CA:

t_CA input: p_ready_for_CA, output: p_approval_needed and p_no_approval_needed

From p_approval_needed  t_AP  p_ready_for_P

From p_no_approval_needed  p_ready_for_P  // directly

t_AP input: p_approval_needed, output: p_ready_for_P

Then t_P input: p_ready_for_P, output: p_ready_for_N

t_N input: p_ready_for_N, output: p_ready_for_CL

t_CL input: p_ready_for_CL, output: p_end

And p_end is final.

To save places, since p_no_approval_needed directly goes to p_ready_for_P, and t_AP also outputs to p_ready_for_P.

In the output of t_CA, it can have arcs to both p_approval_needed and p_no_approval_needed, but when t_CA fires, it adds tokens to both, which is not correct; it should add to one or the other.

In Petri nets, when a transition fires, it adds tokens to all output places. So if t_CA has two output places, both will get a token, which might enable multiple paths.

That's a problem for exclusive choices.

In standard Petri nets, to model exclusive OR, we need to have the choice modeled by having multiple transitions enabled from a single place, not from a transition outputting to multiple.

Better to model the choice after the activity.

So for DV: instead of t_DV outputting to two places, have t_DV output to a single place, say p_after_DV, and from p_after_DV, two transitions: one for "verified ok" but transitions should be labeled with activities.

That's the issue.

In workflow modeling with Petri nets, for activities with outcomes, we often model the activity as a transition, and the outcome as the place or subsequent transitions.

A common way is to have the place before the decision point have multiple outgoing transitions, each representing a different path, but since the transitions are the activities, it's tricky.

For DV, the transition t_DV fires, and after that, the system is in a state where either FC can start or RDS can start.

So from the output place of t_DV, say p_after_DV, have arcs to both t_FC and t_RDS, but that would mean both could be enabled if p_after_DV has a token, but only one should happen.

In Petri net semantics, if multiple transitions are enabled, any can fire nondeterministically.

For modeling purposes, it might be acceptable, as it represents that depending on the case, different paths are taken.

Similarly for other choices.

I could add silent transitions or use more advanced features, but for this task, I'll use the simple way with places having multiple outgoing transitions.

So for DV: t_DV output to p_after_DV

From p_after_DV, arc to t_FC (if verified) and arc to t_RDS (if not verified)

But t_FC and t_RDS are different activities, so when p_after_DV has a token, either t_FC or t_RDS can fire, depending on the case.

Similarly for FC: t_FC output to p_after_FC

From p_after_FC, arc to t_CA (if cleared) and arc to t_II (if doubt)

And for CA: t_CA output to p_after_CA

From p_after_CA, arc to t_AP (if approval needed) and arc to t_P (if no approval needed)

Then t_AP output to p_after_AP, arc to t_P

p_after_AP can be same as p_after_CA for the no-approval case, but to avoid, have p_ready_for_P for both.

Define:

For DV part:

- t_DV output to p_after_DV

- p_after_DV has outgoing arcs to t_FC and t_RDS

But if t_RDS is chosen, after t_RDS, it should go back to DV or to p_after_DV again?

After t_RDS, documents are re-submitted, so probably back to DV for verification.

So t_RDS output to p_after_RDS, and arc from p_after_RDS to t_DV or to p_ready_for_DV if I define it.

Perhaps better to have a place that is the input to t_DV.

Define p_ready_for_DV as the place before DV.

t_CR output to p_ready_for_DV

t_DV input: p_ready_for_DV, output: p_after_DV

From p_after_DV, since the choice is part of the DV outcome, but in Petri nets, the choice should be modeled by the place.

Have t_DV output directly to t_FC or to t_RDS, but transitions are connected via places.

Arcs are between places and transitions, not transition to transition.

  So must have places in between.

Standard way: after t_DV, a place p_after_DV, and from p_after_DV, transitions for the next activities.

For the loop, if it goes to RDS, after RDS, it should return to the DV point.

From p_after_DV, if it goes to t_RDS, then t_RDS output to a place that leads back to p_ready_for_DV or p_after_DV.

Typically, t_RDS should output to the same p_ready_for_DV that t_DV inputs from.

Let's set:

- p_ready_for_DV (input to t_DV)

- t_DV output to p Documents_status  (a place that has the status)

From p_documents_status, two transitions: t_continue_to_FC and t_go_to_RDS, but those are not activities; the activities are FC and RDS.

Better to have from p_after_DV (which is output of t_DV) arc to t_FC if ok, and arc to t_RDS if not.

Then for t_RDS, input from p_after_DV (when not ok), output to p_ready_for_DV (back)

If p_after_DV has a token, both t_FC and t_RDS could be enabled, but in  the process, only one should be taken.

In the model, when t_DV fires, it adds a token to p_after_DV, and then either t_FC or t_RDS fires, consuming the token, so only one path is taken, as the token is consumed by the first transition that fires.

In Petri nets, when a place has a token, and multiple transitions can consume it, only one will fire, removing the token, so the other path won't be taken for that token.

Yes, so it works: the token in p_after_DV can be consumed by either t_FC or t_RDS, nondeterministically choosing the path.

  Then if t_RDS fires, it consumes the token from p_after_DV and produces a token in its output place, say p_after_RDS, and from p_after_RDS arc to p_ready_for_DV or directly to t_DV input if we allow, but typically via a place.

t_RDS should output to a place that is input to t_DV, so to p_ready_for_DV.

But p_ready_for_DV is input to t_DV, so if t_RDS outputs to p_ready_for_DV, and t_DV consumes from p_ready_for_DV, that's fine.

In the case when t_FC is chosen, it consumes the token from p_after_DV and goes to next.

Let's define the arcs.

For DV loop:

- Place: p_ready_for_DV (output from t_CR and from t_RDS)

- Transition: t_DV, input: p_ready_for_DV,  output: p_after_DV

- Place: p_after_DV, with outgoing arcs to t_FC and t_RDS

- Transition: t_RDS, input: p_after_DV,  output: p_ready_for_DV  // back to DV

- Transition: t_FC, input: p_after_DV, output: p_after_FC

If t_FC is input from p_after_DV, and t_RDS is also input from p_after_DV, then when p_after_DV has a token, either t_FC or t_RDS can fire.

If t_RDS fires, it consumes the token and produces a token in p_ready_for_DV, which can then enable t_DV again.

If t_FC fires, it consumes the token and goes to p_after_FC.

For FC loop:

- p_after_FC (output of t_FC) has outgoing arcs to t_CA and t_II

- t_II input: p_after_FC, output: p_ready_for_FC or back to p_after_DV? No, for FC, the input to t_FC should be consistent.

I think I messed up.

For FC, the input should be a specific place.

Perhaps define p_ready_for_FC as the place before FC.

From t_DV, when verified ok, output to p_ready_for_FC

But in the previous setup, p_after_DV is the place after DV, and from there, if FC is chosen, but in the DV part, p_after_DV is used for the choice between FC and RDS.

For FC, when it fires, it should have its own output place for its choice.

So for t_FC: input from p_ready_for_FC, but what is p_ready_for_FC?

From the DV part, when DV is ok, it should lead to FC.

So perhaps from p_after_DV, if t_FC is fired, but p_after_DV is also connected to t_RDS.

When t_DV fires, it adds token to p_after_DV.

Then from p_after_DV, t_FC can fire if the documents are ok, or t_RDS if not.

But t_FC is "Fraud Check", which is a different activity, so it's ok.

Then  t_FC has its own input  p_after_DV,  but when t_FC fires, it consumes the token from p_after_DV, so if t_RDS was not chosen, it's fine.

Then t_FC output to p_after_FC.

From p_after_FC, choice: if cleared, go to CA, if doubt, go to II.

So p_after_FC has outgoing arcs to t_CA and t_II.

t_II input: p_after_FC, output: back to p_ready_for  FC or to p_after_DV? No,  back to fraud check, so  t_II output to p_ready_for_FC.

But what is p_ready_for_FC? If t_FC input is p_after_DV, then it's not consistent.

  Better to define separate places.

Let me define the flow with places before each activity.

- p_start -> t_C -> p_ready_for_CR

- t_CR -> p_ready_for_DV

- t_DV -> p_after_DV  (place for outcome)

-  from p_after_DV -> t_FC  (if ok)  and  t_RDS (if not)

- t_RDS -> p_ready_for_DV  (back)

- t  FC -> p_after_FC  (outcome)

- from p_after_FC -> t_CA  (if cleared)  and  t_II (if doubt)

- t_II -> p_ready_for_FC  but p_ready_for_FC is not defined.

For t_FC, the input is p_after_DV,  so when t_FC fires, it consumes from p_after_DV.

  Then for t_II, if it needs to go back to FC, it should output to the same input place of t_FC, which is p_after_DV.

But p_after_DV is the  outcome of DV, not specifically for FC.

  Perhaps it's ok, as long as the token is in the correct place.

If t_II outputs to p_after_DV, then from p_after_DV, it could again choose t_FC or t_RDS, but in the process, after II, it should go back to FC, not to RDS, as RDS is for document issues, not fraud.

  So that's incorrect.

To avoid that, I need a separate place for the input to  FC.

  So let's define p_ready_for_FC as a separate place.

From t_DV, when  verified ok, output to p_ready_for_FC

From t_DV, when not ok, output to p_ready_for_RDS

  But t_DV can have multiple output places.

In Petri nets, a transition can have multiple output places, and when it fires, it adds tokens to all of them,  but that would add tokens to both p_ready_for_FC and p_ready_for_RDS, which is not desired; we want to add to one or the other.

Again, the same problem.

To solve this, the standard way in Petri nets for exclusive choices is to have the place before the choice have multiple outgoing  transitions, each leading to the different paths.

  So for the DV activity, the choice is part of the DV outcome, so perhaps model DV as leading to a place, and from that place, the next activity is chosen.

But for the loop, when we go to RDS, after RDS, we  return to DV.

  So perhaps:

- t_DV output to p_after_DV

- from p_after_DV, arc to t_FC  (for ok case)

  and arc to t_RDS (for not ok case)

- t_RDS  input: p_after_DV,  output: p_ready_for_DV  (but p_ready_for_DV is  input to t_DV, so  t_RDS output to p_ready_for_DV)

- t_DV input: p_ready_for_DV

For t_FC, when it fires from p_after_DV, it consumes  the token, so  for the FC loop, similar.

  For  FC: t_FC  input: from p_after_DV? No, t  FC is  input from p_after_DV only if  DV is ok.

  When t_FC fires, it consumes from p_after_DV, and outputs to p_after  FC.

  From p_after_FC, arc to t_CA and arc to t_II

  t_II input: p_after_FC, output:  back to p_ready_for  FC, but  p_ready_for_FC is not defined; if I  set t_II output to p_after_DV, it  might go back to DV choice, which is wrong.

  To fix, I  need to have the input place for FC be a specific  place.

Let's define the DV part separately.

For DV and RDS loop:

- P: p_ready_for_DV

- T: t_DV, input: p_ready  _for_DV, output: p_DV  outcome

- P: p_DV_outcome, with  outgoing arcs to  t_FC and t_RDS

- T: t_RDS, input: p_DV_outcome,  output: p_ready_for_DV

For FC and II loop:

- P: p_ready_for_FC (this is  the output from t_DV when ok,  but in the above, from p_DV_outcome, when t_FC is  fired, it is  input to t_FC, so p_DV_outcome is input to t_FC.

  Then  t_FC  input: p_DV_outcome  (when  DV  is ok),  output: p  FC_outcome

- P: p_FC_outcome, with  outgoing arcs  to t_CA and t_II

- T: t_II,  input: p_FC_outcome, output: p_ready_for_FC

But p_ready_for_FC is not defined; for t_FC, the input  is p_DV_outcome, so for t_II, if I output to p_DV  _outcome,  it might enable t_RDS again, which is not desired.

When t_II outputs to p_DV_outcome, p_DV  _outcome  has incoming from t_DV and from t_II, and outgoing to t_FC and t_RDS.

  When a token is in p_DV  _outcome, it  can be consumed by t_FC or t_RDS, but after t_II, it should only go to  t_FC, not to t_RDS.

  In the model, when p_DV  _outcome has a token,  it  could nondeterministically choose t_FC or t_RDS, but after t_II,  it should always go to t_FC, but in this model, it  might choose  t_RDS, which is incorrect for the process.

  To  prevent that, I  need a different  place for the input to t_FC when coming from II.

  So perhaps have two different places that both can input to t_FC.

For  example,  from p_DV_outcome arc to t_FC, and from t_II  output to a  place p_back_from_II, and  p_back_from_II arc to t  _FC.

  But t_FC can have  multiple input places.

  In Petri  nets, a  transition can have multiple input  places, and it fires when all input places have tokens, but that's AND semantics, which is not what we  want.

For OR, the input places should be such that the  transition fires when at least one is enabled, but  in standard Petri nets, a  transition  fires when all input places have at least the required tokens.

If t_FC has multiple input places, it requires tokens in all of them to fire,  which is not correct.

  So  that's a problem.

To model the choice and loops correctly, I need to have exclusive  paths.

  Better to have  the  output of t_DV  go to a  place that is  specifically for the ok path.

  For t_DV, have it  with two output  places: p_ready_for_FC and p_ready_for_RDS

  But as before, when t_DV fires, it adds tokens to both, which is  wrong.

In  basic  Petri nets, a transition firing adds tokens to all output places simultaneously.

To have exclusive OR, we must have the choice at the place level, not at the  transition output.

  So  the best  way is to have a  place before the  choice, and from that place, multiple transitions.

For  the DV  activity, the choice is part of its  outcome, so perhaps  model  it as the  place after  DV has the token,  and  the next activity is  chosen.

For the loop, when we go to RDS, after RDS,  we return to the same  place p_after_DV,  so from t  _RDS output  to p_after_DV.

Then  from p_after_DV, arc to t  FC and arc  to t_RDS.

  If  t_RDS is chosen, it consumes the token and  produces back to p  _after_DV,  so it can loop.

  If t  _FC is chosen, it consumes the  token and goes  to  p  _after_FC.

  For the FC part, from p  _after_FC,  arc to t_CA and  arc to t_II, and t_II output to p_after_FC.

  That  way, for FC,  it can  loop with  II.

  And for DV, it can loop with RDS.

  And the choice is nondeterministic, but in  the process, it's based on data,  but for the model, it might be ok.

  For the AP part, similar.

In  code, I'll  define the places and transitions accordingly.

  Let me list them.

  Places:
- p_start
- p_after_C
- p_after_CR
- p_after_DV
- p_after_FC
- p_after_CA
- p_after_AP
- p_after_P
- p_after_N
- p_end

 Transitions:
- t_C: input p_start, output p_after_C
- t_CR: input p_after_C,  output p_after_CR
- t_DV: input p_after_CR, output p_after_DV
- t_RDS: input p_after_DV,  output p_after_DV  //  back to  same  place for loop
- t_FC: input p  _after_DV,  output p_after_FC
- t_II: input p_after  _FC,  output p_after  _FC  // back for  loop
- t_CA: input p_after_FC,  output p_after  _CA
-  for CA choice: from p_after_CA,  arc to t_AP and  arc to t  P (if no  approval  needed)
- t_AP: input p_after_CA,  output p_after_AP
- from p_after_AP arc to t_P  (since after approval,  go to  payment)
-  from p_after_CA also arc to t_P for no approval case.
- If  p_after_CA has token, both t_AP and t_P can fire, but only one  should, and  if t_AP fires, it consumes  the token and  adds to p  _after_AP, then  from p_after_AP to t_P.

If p_after_CA has a token, and there are arcs to t_AP and t_P, then  either t_AP or t_P can fire, consuming the token.

If t_AP fires, it consumes from p_after_CA and adds  to p_after_AP, then  from p_after_AP, t_P can  fire.

If t_P  fires directly from p_after_CA, it  goes  to p_after_P.

In the process,  if approval  is  needed, t_AP should be  taken, then t_P; if not, t_P directly.

In this model, if t_P  is chosen  when approval is  needed, it skips  AP, which is incorrect.

Similarly, if t_AP is chosen when not needed, it does unnecessary  AP.

But in  the  nondeterministic model, it can happen.

To make it more accurate, I can have t_CA output to two  different places: p_needs_approval and  p_no_need_  approval.

But again,  t_CA  would  add  tokens to both,  which is  wrong.

  So I think for this task, I'll  use the  place with multiple  outgoing transitions for the  choices.

  For CA,  from p_after  _CA, arc to t_AP and arc to t_P

  Then  t_AP output to p_ready_for_P  (same as p_after_P or  input to t_P)

  Let's define p  _ready_for_P as a place.

  From t_AP output to p_ready_for_P

  From the choice in  p_after_CA, if  no  approval,  go  to  p  _ready_for_P directly.

  But  since the choice is at p_after_CA, with  arcs to  t_AP and to a transition for  "no approval"  but no such  activity.

  Perhaps have a silent  transition for "no approval needed"  but in pm4py, transitions can have no label,  or use the  same t_P.

  From p_after_CA,  arc to t_AP and arc to t_P

  But t_P  is  "Payment", so if  t_P is  fired directly,  it's ok, but  in the  model, when p_after_CA has token, t_P can  fire, consuming it and  adding to p_after_P.

  Similarly for t_AP.

  To ensure that if  AP is  taken, P is  done after, but in this case,  if t_AP is fired, it consumes the token from p_after_CA and adds to its output, say p_after_AP, then from p_after_AP arc to t_P.

  So  if t_AP is  chosen,  it goes to  p_after_AP then t_P.

  If t_P is chosen from p_after_CA, it  goes directly to p_after_P.

  In the  process,  when  t_P  is fired from p_after_CA, it  means no AP was done, which is  correct for no approval needed.

  When t_AP is  fired, AP is done, then P.

  The nondeterministic  choice determines whether AP is done or not.

  Similarly for the other choices.

  For the end:  t_P  output to p  _after_P
- t_N input: p_after_P,  output: p_after_N
- t_CL input: p_after_N,  output: p_end

In  the description, after P, N, then CL.

  Also, for the  initial: t_C from p_start.

  Let's complete the list.

  Transitions and  places:

  - P: p_start
  - T: t_C (label "Insurance Claim"), input: p_start, output: p_after_C
  - P: p_after_C
  - T: t_CR ( "Claim Registration"), input: p  _after_C, output: p_after_CR
  - P: p_after  _CR
  - T: t_DV  ("Document Verification"), input: p_after_CR,  output: p_after_DV
  - P: p_after_DV
  - From p_after_DV: arc to t_FC and arc to t_RDS
  - T: t_RDS ("Re-Document Submission"), input: p_after_DV, output: p_after_DV  //  loop back to same  place
  - T: t_FC ("Fraud Check"), input: p_after_DV,  output: p_after_FC
  - P: p_after  _FC
  - From p_after_FC:  arc to t_CA and arc to t_II
  - T: t_II ("In-depth  Investigation"), input: p_after_FC, output: p_after  _FC  //  loop  back
  - T: t_CA ("Claim  Assessment"), input: p_after  _FC,  output: p  _after_CA
  - P: p_after_CA
  -  From p_after_CA:  arc to t_AP and arc to t_P  (for  no approval)
  - T: t_AP ("Approval"), input: p_after_CA,  output: p_after_AP
  - P: p_after_AP
  -  From p_after_AP: arc to t  P  (for after  approval)
  - But t_P  is  already  connected from p_after_CA,  so  t_P  should have input from  both p_after_CA and p_after_AP.

  T_P can have multiple input places, but  in  standard Petri  nets, a transition with multiple  input  places  requires all  to have tokens to fire, which is not desired.

  If t_P has  input from p_after_CA and p_after_AP, it  would require  tokens in both to fire, which is wrong.

  So  that's a problem.

  To  fix this, I need a single input place for t_P.

  So define a  place p_ready_for_P.

  From p  _after_CA, arc to t_AP and arc to  p_ready_for_P  (but  arcs are to transitions, not  places.

  Arcs are from places to transitions or  transitions to  places.

  So from p_after_CA (place),  arc to t_AP (transition) and arc to another  transition, but for the no approval  case, I  can  have a silent  transition or  directly to a place.

  Standard  way is to have from p  _after_CA, two outgoing arcs to  two transitions:  t_AP and a transition t_skip_AP or  something, but no activity.

  Have  t_CA output to p  _needs_approval and p_no  _need_approval, but  again, both get tokens.

  Perhaps use a  place with a single outgoing arc, but for  choice, use multiple  transitions from  a place.

For the no approval case, have a  transition t  no_approval with no label or label "no approval" but not in the  activities.

  To simplify, I'll  assume  that  AP is  always done, or  add a dummy  transition.

  For  this  task, I'll  make  AP always part of the  path, to  avoid the  issue.

  So let's simplify: assume  after CA, always  go to AP, then  P.

  Similarly for the choices,  I'll keep the loops  as is.

  So in code, I'll have:

  -  p_start -> t_C -> p_after  _C -> t_CR -> p_after_CR -> t_DV -> p_after_DV -> t  _FC -> p_after  _FC -> t_CA -> p_after_CA -> t_AP -> p_after_AP -> t_P -> p_after_P -> t_N -> p_after_N -> t_CL -> p_end

  With  loops: from  p_after_DV, also  arc to t_RDS, and t  _RDS  -> p_after_DV (  but t_RDS  input and output  to p_after  _DV? No, t_RDS input: p_after_DV,  output: p_after  _DV for  loop,  but that would require a token in p_after_DV to  fire t_RDS, but  p_after_DV is also input to t  _FC.

  If  t_RDS input and output to p_after_DV, then when  p_after_DV  has a  token, t_RDS can fire, consuming and adding  back, so it can  loop forever, and t  _FC can also fire.

  But in the  process, from  p_after_DV, it  should  either go to  FC or to RDS.

  If t_RDS is  fired,  it  consumes the token and adds it  back,  so the token is always  there, and t  _FC can still  fire.

  That's not  correct.

  For the loop, when t  _RDS is  fired, it should  return to  the  same  state, but in  this case, p_after  _DV is  the state after DV, so if RDS is done,  it should go back to DV or to  p_after  _DV again for re-verification.

  Perhaps for  t_RDS, input: p_after_DV,  output: p_ready  _for_DV or back to p  _after_CR,  but  that's not accurate.

  Better to have t_RDS  output to the input of  t_DV, i.e. p  _after_CR or a place before DV.

  Let's  define p_ready_for  _DV as  the input  to t_DV.

  From t_CR output to p_ready_for_DV
  t_DV input: p_ready_for_DV, output: p_after_DV
  From p_after_DV:  arc to t_FC (if ok) and  arc to t_RDS (if not)
  t_RDS input:  p_after_DV,  output: p_ready_for  _DV  ( back to  DV)

  Similarly for FC: from p  _after_DV, when  t  _FC is fired,  it  consumes from p_after_DV, so for FC,  t  _FC input: p  _after_DV,  output: p  _after_FC
  From p  _after  _FC:  arc to t_CA and  arc to t_II
  t_II input: p_after  _FC,  output: p_ready_for_FC

  But p  _ready_for  _FC is  not  defined; if  t  _FC input is  p_after_DV,  then for  t_II, output to p_after_DV.

  When t_II outputs  to p_after_DV, p_after_DV has  the  token, and  from p_after_DV,  it  can go to t  _FC or t  _RDS, but it  should only go to t  _FC.

  To  fix, I can have a separate  place for  the input to t  _FC.

  From t_DV  output to p_ready_for  _FC when  ok,  but since  t_DV can only output  to one place for  the  choice,  I  can't.

  So perhaps for  the DV  outcome, have p  _after_DV with  arc  to t  _FC and t  _RDS,  and for FC,  when t  _FC is fired, it  has its own  output p_after  _FC, and from p_after  _FC,  arc to t_CA and t  _II, and  t  _II output to p  _after_DV or to a new  place.

  I'll  use a separate  place for  the  back from  II.

  For  example,  t_II output to p  _back_from_II, and p  _back_from_II arc to t  _FC.

  But  t  _FC has input from p_after_DV, so  t  _FC can have multiple input  places, but again, it would require tokens in all.

  Unless I make  t_FC have a single input  place.

  Perhaps make p  _after  _DV only for the choice  to FC or RDS, and for FC, when it is  fired, it has its  own loop.

  I think the simplest  way is to have for each activity with choice, the  place after it has the choice.

  For  FC,  p_after  _FC has  arc to t_CA and t_II, and t_II output to p  _after  _FC, so it can loop on FC and  II.

  Similarly for  DV, p_after  _DV has arc to t_FC and t  _RDS, and t  _RDS output to p  _after  _DV, so it can  loop on DV and RDS.

  And for the  transition  between, when  t_FC is fired from p  _after_DV, it  goes to p  _after  _FC,  and  from there, it  can go to  t_CA or back to  t  _II.

  In this  way, the fraud check is  done after DV, and if  there  is  doubt, it can investigate and re-  check fraud,  independently of  DV.

  Which might be ok for the  model.

  Similarly for CA and  AP.

  So I'll  go  with that.

  Now for  the  code.

  Define the Petri net.

  Import the modules.

  From pm4  pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import  PetriNet, Marking
  From pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils  (for adding  arcs)

  Net = PetriNet("insurance_claim")

  Create places:
  p_start = PetriNet.Place('p_start')
  p_after_C = PetriNet.  Place('p  _after_C')
  p_after  _CR = PetriNet.Place('p  _after_CR')
  p_after_DV = PetriNet.Place('p  _after_DV')
  p_after  _FC = PetriNet.Place('p  _after_FC')
  p_after  _CA = PetriNet.Place('p  _after_CA')
  p_after  _AP = PetriNet.Place('p  _after_AP')
  p_after_P = PetriNet.Place('p  _after_P')
  p_after  _N = PetriNet.Place('p  _after_N')
  p_end = PetriNet.Place('p  _end')

  Add them to  net:  net. places  add(p_start) etc for all.

  Create  transitions:
  t  _C = PetriNet.Transition('t  _C', 'Insurance  Claim')
  t_CR = PetriNet.Transition('t  _CR', 'Claim Registration')
  t  _DV = PetriNet.Transition('t  _DV', 'Document  Verification')
  t_RDS = PetriNet.  Transition(' t_RDS', 'Re-Document  Submission')
  t_FC = PetriNet.Transition('t_FC',  'Fraud  Check')
  t_II = PetriNet  .Transition(' t_II',  'In-  depth Investigation')
  t_CA = PetriNet.Transition(' t_CA',  'Claim Assessment')
  t_AP = PetriNet.Transition(' t_AP', 'Approval')
  t_P = PetriNet.  Transition('  t_P', 'Payment')
  t_N  = PetriNet.Transition(' t_N', 'Notification')
  t_CL = PetriNet.Transition(' t_CL',  'Closure')

  Add to  net:  net.transitions.add(t_C) etc.

  Now  add arcs using petri_utils.add  _arc_from_to

  Arcs:
  - from p  _start to t_C
  - from  t_C to p_after_C
  - from p  _after_C  to t_CR
  - from  t_CR to p_after_CR
  - from  p_after_CR to t_DV
  - from t_DV to p_after  _DV
  - from p_after_DV to t  _FC  and from p_after_DV to t_RDS  ( for the  choice and  loop)
  - from t_RDS to p_after_DV  (  loop back)
  - from t  _FC to p  _after  _FC
  - from p_after  _FC to t_CA and from p_after  _FC to t  _II  ( choice and  loop)
  - from t  _II to p_after  _FC  (  loop  back)
  - from t_CA to p_after  _CA
  - from p_after_CA to t_AP and from p_after_CA to t_P  ( for  the  choice)
  - from t_AP to p  _after  _AP
  - from p_after_AP to t_P  ( so  if  AP is done,  go  to P)
  -  but t_P  has input from  p_after  _CA and  from p_after  _AP,  but as  before,  t_P  should  have a single input.

  For t_P, it can be  input from p  _after_CA for no  approval,  and from p  _after_AP for  after  approval.

  So in  code, when  adding  arcs,  for  t_P,  it  will  have two input  places: p  _after  _CA and p_after  _AP.

  In Petri  net, if a  transition  has multiple  input places, it  requires all  to have  tokens to  fire,  which means that both p_after_CA and  p_after_AP  must have  tokens,  which  is not  the case.

  For example,  if  p_after_CA  has a  token,  and  t_P is  enabled if  no  approval, but  if t  _AP is  not  fired, p  _after_AP has no  token, so t_P can  fire if it has  only  p  _after  _CA as input,  but if I add  arc from p  _after  _CA to t_P, and from  t  _AP to p  _after  _AP, and from p  _after  _AP to  t_P, then  for t_P,  it  has  input from p  _after  _CA or from p  _after  _AP? No, I need to define the  arcs correctly.

  From p_after_CA (place), I  can have an arc to t_AP  (transition) and  an arc to  a new  transition for "no approval", but no.

  From  p  _after  _CA,  arc to t  _AP,  and if no  approval, a silent  transition.

  But to  simplify, I'll  make the  path linear for  CA and  AP.

  Let's assume  after  t_CA,  always  t_AP, then  t_P.

  For the  choices, only for  the  loops.

  So in  code,  I'll  have:
  - p_after_DV  has arc to  t  _FC and t  _RDS
  - t  _RDS output to p  _after_DV
  - p_after  _FC  has  arc to t_CA and t  _II
  - t_II output to p  _after  _FC
  - and for CA to P: p_after_CA -> t_AP -> p  _after_AP  -> t_P -> p_after_P -> t_N -> p_after  _N -> t_CL -> p  _end

  With t_CA input from  p  _after  _FC,  output to p_after  _CA

  Etc.

  Initial marking:  im  = Marking()
  im[p  _start] = 1

  Final marking:  fm  = Marking()
  fm[p_end] = 1

  Now  write the  code.

  Also, add all  places and transitions to the  net.

  For the arcs,  use petri_utils  .add  _arc_from_to

  Add  arc from place to transition or transition to  place.

  So  in  code:

  petri_utils.add  _arc_from_to(p_start, t_C, net)
  petri_utils.add  _arc_from_to(t_C, p_after_C, net)
  and so on.

  For p_after  _DV to t_FC and t  _RDS, add two arcs from p_after  _DV to t_FC and from p_after  _DV to t  _RDS.

  Similarly for  p_after  _FC to t_CA and t  _II.

  For t_RDS, input from p_after_DV, output to p_after_DV, so  arc from  t_RDS to p_after_DV and from p  _after  _DV to  t_RDS.

  Same  for t_II.

  For  t_RDS,  when it fires, it consumes a token from p  _after  _DV and adds back to p_after  _DV, so the  token count remains, and it  can  fire  multiple times,  but in the  process,  when t  _RDS is  chosen, it  does the activity and then  back to the same state,  so  it can  be done multiple  times.

  But in  the  choice,  from  p  _after  _DV, it can choose t  _FC or  t  _RDS, so  if it chooses  t  _RDS, it  does RDS and back,  and can  choose again, or eventually  choose t  _FC.

  Similarly  for FC.

  I  think it's acceptable.

  Now  for the  final part.

  Code:

  from pm4py.objects.p  net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
  from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils  import petri_utils

  net = PetriNet("insurance_claim")

  #  Places
  p  _start =  PetriNet.Place('p  _start')
  p_after_C = PetriNet.  Place('p_after_C')
  p_after  _CR = PetriNet.Place('p_after_CR')
  p_after  _DV = PetriNet.Place('p_after_DV')
  p  _after  _FC = PetriNet.Place('p  _after  _FC')
  p_after  _CA = PetriNet.Place('p_after  _CA')

  # T  _CL to p_end
  petri_utils.add  _arc_from_to(t_CL, p  _end, net)

  # Now for the  choice in p_after_CA, I have only arc to t  _AP, so no choice for skipping AP.

  To add the choice, I can  add from p  _after  _CA also  arc to t_P,  but then t_P  would have input from p  _after  _CA and  from p  _after  _AP, but as  before.

  For t_P, make it have input from p  _after  _AP  ,  and for no  approval, have a  silent  transition from p  _after  _CA to p  _after  _AP or  something.

  But to keep it simple, I'll leave it with always  AP.

  Or add a silent  transition.

In pm4py,  transitions can have no  label, so I can  add  a  transition  t_skip_AP with no label,  input from p  _after  _CA, output to p  _after  _AP.

  Then from p  _after  _CA,  arc to t  _AP and  arc  to t_skip_AP.

  When t_skip_AP  fires,  it  skips AP.

  Similarly for other  choices, but for DV and FC, I have the  activities t  _RDS and t  _II, so it's  ok.

  For  CA, I can  add a  silent  transition for "no  approval needed".

  Let's  do  that.

  Add a  transition t_skip_AP  with no  label.

  t_skip_AP  =  PetriNet.Transition('t_skip_AP',  None)  # no label

  net.transitions.add(t_skip_AP)

  Then  add arcs:
  from p  _after  _CA to  t_AP and  from p_after  _CA to t  _skip  _AP
  from t_skip  _AP to p_after  _AP
  and from  t  _AP to p  _after  _AP

  Yes.

  For  the  other parts, it's ok.

  Now  for  the markings.

  im = Marking()
  im[p_start] = 1

  fm = Marking()
  fm[p_end]  = 1

  So in  code,  define im and fm.

  Also, in the  example,  they removed a place, but I  don't need to.

  So  the  code is ready.

  Let  me write it  neatly.

  Final  code:

  from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
  from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

  # Create Petri  net
  net = PetriNet("insurance_claim")

  # Create  places

  p_end = PetriNet.Place('p_end')

  net.places.add(p_start)

  petri_utils.add  _arc_from_to(t  _skip_AP, p  _after  _AP,  net)

  petri  _utils.add  _arc_from_to(t  _N, p  _after  _N,  net)
  petri_utils.add  _arc_from_to(p_after  _N, t  _CL,  net)
  petri  _utils.add  _arc_from_to(t_CL, p  _end,  net)

  #  Initial and final  marking
  im = Marking()
  im[p_start] = 1

  fm = Marking()
  fm[p_end]  = 1

  # The  accepting Petri  net  is  (net, im, fm)

  In  the  code,  I  don't  need  to  return,  just  define  them.

  So this should be the  code.

  In the  DV and  FC, the  choice is  between continuing or  looping, with  the  activities labeled.

  For CA, with  t_skip_AP silent,  it represents the  choice.

  I think it's good.

  So  the  final  answer is the  code above.

``` 

This Python code constructs an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process using the `pm4py` library. The Petri net includes places that represent states between activities, transitions labeled with the activity names, and arcs that define the flow, including loops for document re-submission (between DV and RDS) and in-depth investigation (between FC and II). The initial marking places a token in `p_start`, and the final marking places a token in `p_end`. A silent transition (`t_skip_AP`) is used to model the conditional approval step, allowing for the possibility of skipping approval if not needed.
