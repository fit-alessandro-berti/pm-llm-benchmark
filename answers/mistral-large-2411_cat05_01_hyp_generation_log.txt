### Identifying Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

1. **Out of Order Activities:**
   - **Case 1002:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity was performed before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock."
   - **Case 1003:** The "Ship Goods" activity was performed before "Confirm Shipment."
   - **Case 1004:** The "Receive Payment" activity was performed before "Issue Invoice" and "Confirm Shipment."

2. **Missing Activities:**
   - **Case 1004:** The "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock" activities are missing.

3. **Early or Late Activities:**
   - **Case 1002:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity was attempted early.
   - **Case 1003:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity was confirmed late.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **System Errors:**
   - The system might have bugs or misconfigurations that allow activities to be performed out of order.

2. **Policy Violations:**
   - Employees might be ignoring the standard operating procedures, leading to activities being performed in the wrong sequence.

3. **Training Issues:**
   - Lack of proper training could result in employees not following the correct order of activities.

4. **Manual Interventions:**
   - Manual overrides or special circumstances might lead to skipping or reordering activities.

### SQL Queries to Investigate Hypotheses

1. **Identify Out of Order Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Receive Payment')
   AND event_id < (
       SELECT MIN(event_id)
       FROM order_event_log AS sub
       WHERE sub.case_id = order_event_log.case_id
       AND sub.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
   );
   ```

2. **Find Missing Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT case_id
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id NOT IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
   )
   AND case_id NOT IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock'
   );
   ```

3. **Detect Early or Late Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
   AND timestamp < (
       SELECT MIN(timestamp)
       FROM order_event_log AS sub
       WHERE sub.case_id = order_event_log.case_id
       AND sub.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
   );
   ```

4. **Check for Manual Interventions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp, resource, additional_info
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early%'
   OR additional_info LIKE '%late_confirmation%';
   ```

5. **Investigate Policy Violations or Training Issues:**
   ```sql
   SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, r.role, r.department
   FROM order_event_log AS oel
   JOIN resources AS r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
   WHERE oel.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Receive Payment')
   AND oel.event_id < (
       SELECT MIN(event_id)
       FROM order_event_log AS sub
       WHERE sub.case_id = oel.case_id
       AND sub.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
   );
   ```

6. **Identify Orders with Payment Received Before Invoice:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
   AND timestamp < (
       SELECT MIN(timestamp)
       FROM order_event_log AS sub
       WHERE sub.case_id = order_event_log.case_id
       AND sub.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
   );
   ```

### Conclusion

By running these SQL queries, you can further investigate the anomalies and undesirable behaviors identified in the event log. This will help in understanding the root causes and taking corrective actions to ensure the process flows as intended.
