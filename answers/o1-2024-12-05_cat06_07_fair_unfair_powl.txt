Below are two POWL model representations. Both include the key stages from the provided description, but differ in how the cultural fit and affiliation step is handled. The first includes an XOR branching that introduces subtle unfairness; the second removes that branching and treats all candidates uniformly.

**Key Activities (Common to Both Models):**  
- **ReceiveApplication:** Initial collection of the applicant’s resume and questionnaire.  
- **DataCompletenessCheck:** A check to ensure that all required data is provided.  
- **RequestMoreInfo:** Loop activity triggered if the application data is incomplete.  
- **SkillAssessment:** Online skill test filtering out unqualified applicants.  
- **CulturalFitCheck:** Evaluation of candidate’s cultural alignment with the company.  
- **CommunityAffiliationCheck (Only in Unfair Model):** Special check that provides subtle advantages to certain local or affiliated candidates.  
- **ManagerialReview:** Human review of borderline candidates.  
- **FinalDecision:** The hiring outcome.

The **LOOP** operator is used for data completeness checks (DataCompletenessCheck followed by optional RequestMoreInfo if data is missing).  
The **XOR** operator is used for branching: In the unfair model, an XOR selects between the standard CulturalFitCheck and the CommunityAffiliationCheck. In the fair model, no XOR is used at that stage.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, after the skill assessment, we have an XOR that can lead to either a standard cultural fit check or a special “CommunityAffiliationCheck” activity. The latter provides subtle preferential treatment, introducing the potential for unfair bias.

**Structure (Textual):**  
**ReceiveApplication** -> * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) -> SkillAssessment -> X (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

**Python-like POWL Construction:**
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions (activities)
RA = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DC = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RMI = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SA = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CFC = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CAC = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
MR = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FD = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop structure for data completeness checks
# * (DC, RMI) means: Perform DC, and if incomplete, do RMI then go back to DC, until complete.
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DC, RMI])

# Define the XOR structure for cultural fit vs. community affiliation
xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CFC, CAC])

# Build the strict partial order linking everything
unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RA, loop_data, SA, xor_cultural, MR, FD])
unfair_model.order.add_edge(RA, loop_data)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(loop_data, SA)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(SA, xor_cultural)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(xor_cultural, MR)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(MR, FD)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model, all applicants receive the same cultural fit evaluation, and no separate community affiliation branch exists. The XOR step is removed. Everyone goes through the CulturalFitCheck uniformly.

**Structure (Textual):**  
**ReceiveApplication** -> * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) -> SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

**Python-like POWL Construction:**
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions (activities)
RA = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DC = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RMI = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SA = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CFC = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Single, uniform step now
MR = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FD = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop structure for data completeness checks
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DC, RMI])

# Since we have no unfair branching, we do not create an XOR for cultural evaluation
fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RA, loop_data, SA, CFC, MR, FD])
fair_model.order.add_edge(RA, loop_data)
fair_model.order.add_edge(loop_data, SA)
fair_model.order.add_edge(SA, CFC)
fair_model.order.add_edge(CFC, MR)
fair_model.order.add_edge(MR, FD)
```

**Summary:**  
- The “Unfair” POWL model introduces an XOR choice after the SkillAssessment, where one branch (CommunityAffiliationCheck) gives an advantage to certain applicants.  
- The “Fair” POWL model removes this XOR branching and ensures that all applicants are evaluated through the same CulturalFitCheck activity, thereby reducing the risk of subtle biases creeping into the hiring decision.
