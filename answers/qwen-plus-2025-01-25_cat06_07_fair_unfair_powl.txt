Below are the two POWL models as requested, implemented in Python using the `pm4py` library. The first model includes potential unfairness through an XOR branch for community affiliation checks, while the second model removes this bias by ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process.

### **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model introduces an XOR branch after the skill assessment step. One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, while the other applies a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" activity that gives preferential treatment based on local group affiliations.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops
loop_data_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define XOR choice for cultural fit evaluation
xor_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define partial order for the main workflow
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_data_check, SkillAssessment, xor_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_check)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_data_check, SkillAssessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_cultural_fit)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Print or visualize the model if needed
```

### **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This model ensures fairness by removing the XOR branch related to community affiliations. All applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops
loop_data_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define partial order for the main workflow
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_data_check, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root_fair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_check)
root_fair.order.add_edge(loop_data_check, SkillAssessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root_fair.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Print or visualize the model if needed
```

### Explanation of Differences Between Models

1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**
   - After the skill assessment (`SkillAssessment`), there is an XOR choice (`XOR`) between two paths:
     - A standard cultural fit evaluation (`CulturalFitCheck`)
     - A community affiliation check (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`) that may introduce subtle bias.
   - This structure allows certain applicants to receive preferential treatment based on their affiliations.

2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness:**
   - The XOR branch is removed, and all applicants proceed directly to the same cultural fit evaluation (`CulturalFitCheck`) after the skill assessment.
   - This ensures that no applicant receives preferential treatment based on external factors like community affiliations.

Both models include loops for data completeness checks and sequential steps for skill assessments, managerial reviews, and final decisions, ensuring consistency in other parts of the hiring process.
