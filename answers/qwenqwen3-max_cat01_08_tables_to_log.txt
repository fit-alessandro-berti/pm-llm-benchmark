# Integrated Event Log for Process Mining

Below is the comprehensive event log derived from the provided ERP tables. Each row represents a single event in the lifecycle of an order, identified by `order_id` as the Case ID. Events are chronologically ordered within each case. Where applicable, Resource/Actor information and additional attributes are included.

The following activities were derived:
- **Order Created** — from `Orders` table.
- **Item Picked** — one event per line in `Order Lines` table.
- **Order Dispatched** — from `Delivery` table (one event per delivery record).
- **Order Arrived** — from `Delivery` table (one event per delivery record).
- **Invoice Issued** — from `Invoice` table (one event per invoice).
- **Payment Received** — from `Payments` table (one event per payment).

Resource names are enriched using the `Resources` table. Item descriptions are included where relevant for context.

## Assumptions Documented

1. **Case Identifier**: `order_id` is used as the Case ID throughout, as instructed.
2. **Event Granularity**:
   - Each item picking is treated as a separate event to preserve operational detail.
   - Each delivery (dispatch and arrival) is treated as a separate event, even for split shipments.
   - Each invoice and payment is treated as a separate event, even if multiple exist per order.
3. **Resource Mapping**: Resource IDs (e.g., `SP-001`, `WH-001`, `CR-01`, `BL-001`) are mapped to human-readable names using the `Resources` table. For payments, the `payment_method` is used as the "Resource/Actor" since no human actor is specified.
4. **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered strictly by timestamp within each case. Where timestamps are identical (e.g., multiple items picked at same time), order is preserved as presented in source data.
5. **Missing Data**: Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment records — only “Order Created” and “Item Picked” events are included. This may indicate an incomplete process or data omission — no assumptions were made to fabricate missing events.
6. **Attribute Enrichment**: Item descriptions from the `Products` table are included in “Item Picked” events for better context. Customer ID and priority are included in “Order Created” for traceability.

This event log is now suitable for process mining analysis, including conformance checking, bottleneck detection, and process discovery.
