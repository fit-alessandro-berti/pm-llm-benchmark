# Process Mining Event Log

Based on the provided ERP tables, I've integrated the data to create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining. Below is the final event log in chronological order per case.

## Assumptions Made:
1. Each order line item picking is treated as a separate "Item Picked" event to preserve granularity
2. Each delivery record generates two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived"
3. Each invoice generates one "Invoice Issued" event
4. Each payment generates one "Payment Received" event
5. Resource names were mapped from the Resources table using the resource_id
6. For activities without explicit resource information (like order creation), I've used the sales_person_id as the resource
7. Order 1004 has no invoice or payment records, so those events are not included
