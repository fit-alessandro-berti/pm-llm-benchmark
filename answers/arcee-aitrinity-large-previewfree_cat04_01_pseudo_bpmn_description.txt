It starts with the arrival of a customer request, which is the trigger for the whole flow. The first decision point examines whether the request is a standard or custom type.

For a standard request, the process moves into a validation phase. Here, multiple checks—like credit and inventory—run at the same time, ensuring both financial and supply readiness. Once both are complete, the system calculates the delivery date, which is essential for setting expectations.

If the request is custom, the focus shifts to feasibility. A feasibility analysis determines whether the customization can be done. If it's possible, the process moves to preparing a custom quotation. If not, the customer is notified of the rejection, and the flow ends there.

After either the standard or custom path is complete, the process checks whether managerial approval is required. If so, it's requested. Should approval be granted, the process proceeds to generate the final invoice. If not, it loops back—to re-evaluate conditions—either to the quotation stage (for custom requests) or to the delivery date calculation (for standard ones). If no approval is needed at all, it skips straight to invoice generation.

The last step is to send a confirmation to the customer, closing the loop.

The gateways control the flow: the XOR gateways enforce exclusive choices, ensuring only one path is taken at a time, while the AND gateway enables parallel execution of checks. The loop-back points allow for re-work when conditions aren't met, keeping the process adaptive. The distinction between standard and custom paths is clear: standard requests emphasize parallel checks and delivery planning, while custom requests focus on feasibility and tailored quotations.
