Here's the integrated event log derived from the provided tables, along with explanations and assumptions:

**Assumptions and Decisions:**

*   **Item Picking Granularity:** I've created one "Item Picked" event per *order line item*.  This provides a more detailed view of the picking process. An alternative would be to create a single "Items Picked" event per order, aggregating picking times (which would be less informative for process mining).
*   **Delivery Events:**  I've created separate "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events for each *delivery*. This is important because a single order can have multiple deliveries.
*   **Invoice Events:** A single "Invoice Issued" event is created per invoice.
*  **Payment Events:** Each payment record creates a distinct "Payment Received" event, linked to an invoice.
*  **Resources and Attributes:** Resources are assigned where available (sales person, picker, carrier, billing person).  Additional attributes like `customer_type`, `order_priority`, `item_description` (from the `Products` table), `item_category`, `delivery_note`, `payment_method` and  `payment_reference` are included for enrichment.
*   **Missing Invoice for Order 1004**: Order 1004 does not contain any invoice. I create the event for creating the order, picking the items and dispatch/arrival delivery, but after that the order ends. I assume that the invoice is created, but not yet registered in the invoice table.

This table represents the event log.  It can be directly imported into process mining tools that accept CSV or similar tabular formats.  The `Resource/Actor` column is populated where possible, and additional attributes provide context for each event. The chronological order is maintained, and events are grouped by `Case ID`. Note how order 1002 shows two deliveries, showcasing the handling of split shipments. Also, order 1004 is missing the invoicing and payment information.
