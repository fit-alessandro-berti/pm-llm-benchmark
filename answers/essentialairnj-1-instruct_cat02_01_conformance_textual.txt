### Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

Let's analyze each case in the event log to see if they comply with the normative process described.

---

### Case ID: 1

**Activities:**

- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment
- Package items
- Ship order
- Close order

**Analysis:**

1. **Receive order** is the first activity, which aligns with the process.
2. **Check inventory** occurs after receiving the order, which is correct.
3. **Authorize payment** occurs after checking inventory and before packaging, which aligns with the process.
4. **Package items** occurs after authorization and before shipping, which is correct.
5. **Ship order** occurs after packaging, which aligns with the process.
6. **Close order** is the final activity, which is correct.

**Conclusion for Case 1: No violations.**

### Case ID: 2

**Activities:**

- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Package items
- Authorize payment
- Ship order
- Close order

**Analysis:**

1. **Receive order** is the first activity, which aligns with the process.
2. **Check inventory** occurs after receiving the order, which is correct.
3. **Package items** occurs after checking inventory but before authorization of payment. This is a **violation**, as payment authorization should only occur after checking inventory and before packaging.

**Conclusion for Case 2: Violation.** Payment authorization should occur after checking inventory and before packaging.

### Case ID: 3

**Activities:**

- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment
- Cancel order
- Ship order
- Close order

**Analysis:**

1. **Receive order** is the first activity, which aligns with the process.
2. **Check inventory** occurs after receiving the order, which is correct.
3. **Authorize payment** occurs after checking inventory, which is correct.
4. **Cancel order** occurs after authorization, which violates the process, as cancellation should only occur after checking inventory and not necessarily after authorization.

**Violation: Cancel order occurs after authorization.**

But, there's another violation:

5. **Ship order** occurs after cancellation, which violates the process, as shipping should never occur after cancellation.

**Conclusion for Case 3: Violations.** Cancel order should not occur after authorization, and ship order should not occur after cancellation.

### Case ID: 4

**Activities:**

- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Cancel order
- Close order

**Analysis:**

1. **Receive order** is the first activity, which aligns with the process.
2. **Check inventory** occurs after receiving the order, which is correct.
3. **Cancel order** occurs after checking inventory and before closing, which is correct for the inventory insufficient scenario.

**Conclusion for Case 4: No violations.**

### Case ID: 5

**Activities:**

- Receive order
- Check inventory
- Authorize payment
- Ship order
- Close order

**Analysis:**

1. **Receive order** is the first activity, which aligns with the process.
2. **Check inventory** occurs after receiving the order, which is correct.
3. **Authorize payment** occurs after checking inventory, which is correct.
4. **Ship order** occurs after authorization but there's no packaging before shipping. This is a **violation**, as shipping should **never occur before packaging**.

**Conclusion for Case 5: Violation.** Package items should occur after authorization and before shipping.
