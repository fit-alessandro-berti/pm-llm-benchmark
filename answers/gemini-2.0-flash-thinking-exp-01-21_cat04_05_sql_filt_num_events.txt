```sql
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log AS el
WHERE el.case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING count(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inner Query (Subquery):**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING count(*) <= 6
   ```
   - `SELECT case_id`: This selects the `case_id` column.
   - `FROM event_log`:  Specifies the table to retrieve data from.
   - `GROUP BY case_id`: This groups the rows in `event_log` by `case_id`.  This is crucial because we want to count events *per case*.
   - `HAVING count(*) <= 6`: This filters the *groups* created by `GROUP BY`. `count(*)` counts the number of events in each group (i.e., for each `case_id`).  `HAVING` then keeps only those groups (and their corresponding `case_id`s) where the event count is less than or equal to 6.  **Important:** `HAVING` is used to filter grouped results, unlike `WHERE` which filters individual rows *before* grouping.

2. **Outer Query (Main Query):**
   ```sql
   SELECT el.*
   FROM event_log AS el
   WHERE el.case_id IN (...)
   ```
   - `SELECT el.*`: This selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table, aliased as `el` for brevity.
   - `FROM event_log AS el`: Specifies the `event_log` table and gives it the alias `el`.
   - `WHERE el.case_id IN (...)`: This is the filtering condition. It checks if the `case_id` of each row in `event_log` (`el.case_id`) is present in the set of `case_id`s returned by the inner subquery.

**In summary, the query works in two steps:**

1. **Identify Valid Case IDs:** The inner query finds all `case_id`s that have 6 or fewer events associated with them.
2. **Filter Events:** The outer query then selects all rows from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` is one of the valid `case_id`s identified in the inner query.

**Alternative using JOIN (potentially more efficient in some databases, and often preferred for readability in complex scenarios):**

```sql
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log AS el
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING count(*) <= 6
) AS valid_cases ON el.case_id = valid_cases.case_id;
```

**Explanation of the JOIN version:**

- The inner subquery remains the same, identifying `case_id`s with 6 or fewer events and aliased as `valid_cases`.
- `JOIN ... ON el.case_id = valid_cases.case_id`: This performs an `INNER JOIN` between the `event_log` table (aliased as `el`) and the `valid_cases` subquery. The join condition is that the `case_id` in `event_log` must match a `case_id` in the `valid_cases` result.  This effectively filters `event_log` to only include rows whose `case_id` is present in the `valid_cases` set.

Both the `IN` and `JOIN` versions will achieve the same result. In DuckDB, performance differences are likely to be minimal for typical event log sizes.  Choose the version you find more readable and maintainable. The `JOIN` version is often considered more standard and potentially more performant in very large datasets across different database systems.
