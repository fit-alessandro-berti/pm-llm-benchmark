Here are the proposed opposite concepts, more general concepts, and explanations for each of the given Petri net field concepts:

### 1. **Source Place**

- **Given Concept:** A *Source Place* is a place in a Petri net that has no incoming arcs, meaning it cannot be depleted by any transition; tokens in such places can only increase or remain constant.
  
- **Opposite Concept:** **Sink Place**
  - **Definition:** A *Sink Place* would have no outgoing arcs, ensuring that once tokens arrive at this place, they cannot move to another place within the net. All transitions that produce tokens for a Sink Place are effectively terminal points for those tokens.

- **More General Concept:** **I/O Place** (Input/Output Place)
  - **Definition:** An *I/O Place* refers to any place in the Petri net that has either an incoming arc, an outgoing arc, or both. This encompasses all places except isolated ones (which have no arcs), generalizing the notion beyond purely source or sink dynamics.

### 2. **Immediate Transition**

- **Given Concept:** An *Immediate Transition* is a transition in a timed Petri net with a firing delay of zero, meaning it fires as soon as it is enabled without any time passing.

- **Opposite Concept:** **Delayed Transition (with non-zero, non-infinite lower bound)**
  - **Definition:** A transition that cannot fire immediately upon being enabled. It has a minimum time delay greater than zero before it can fire, introducing a mandatory waiting period.

- **More General Concept:** **Timed Transition**
  - **Definition:** Encompasses transitions with any specified firing delay or distribution (immediate, delayed by a fixed amount, following a stochastic process, etc.), providing a broad category for transitions influenced by time in their firing semantics.

### 3. **Live Transition**

- **Given Concept:** A *Live Transition* is one that is guaranteed to fire infinitely often in an infinite run of the net, ensuring some form of ongoing activity related to this transition.

- **Opposite Concept:** **Dead Transition**
  - **Definition:** A transition that will never be enabled (and thus cannot fire) from some point onward in any possible execution of the Petri net. Its preconditions for firing are permanently unmet.

- **More General Concept:** **Potentially Firable Transition**
  - **Definition:** This refers to any transition whose firing conditions can be met at least once under some marking (state) of the net, generalizing across live, dead, and transitions with conditional liveness depending on initial conditions or external inputs.

### 4. **Bounded Net**

- **Given Concept:** A *Bounded Net* is a Petri net where for every possible marking reachable from the initial state, each place has a finite maximum number of tokens it can hold. This prevents uncontrolled growth in token counts.

- **Opposite Concept:** **Unbounded Net**
  - **Definition:** In an *Unbounded Net*, there exists at least one place that can potentially accumulate an unlimited number of tokens from the initial state, indicating a potential for infinite growth under certain execution paths.

- **More General Concept:** **Safeness-Level Net (Specified Safeness)** 
  - **Definition:** This concept encompasses nets where each place has a defined safeness level—a specified maximum token count. It generalizes to include both bounded (with finite safeness levels) and unbounded (with infinite or unspecified safeness levels) characterizations, allowing for nuanced classification based on safeness criteria.

### 5. **Free Choice Net**

- **Given Concept:** A *Free Choice Net* is a Petri net where every conflict (choice between transitions from the same set of input places) is a free choice; essentially, each transition's enabling is independent of other choices, promoting a kind of non-determinism without competition for shared preconditions beyond place capacity.

- **Opposite Concept:** **Pure Conflict Net**
  - **Definition:** In a *Pure Conflict Net*, every conflict involves transitions competing directly over the same resource set (input places with limited tokens), necessitating a competitive choice mechanism, such as priority or external resolution, whenever multiple conflicting transitions are enabled.

- **More General Concept:** **Conflict-Tolerant Net**
  - **Definition:** This broad concept includes any Petri net that allows for mechanisms to handle conflicts among transitions—be it through free choice (non-competing preconditions), structured competition (priorities, arbiter processes), or even dynamic conflict resolution strategies. It encapsulates the spectrum of how different nets manage choices and competitions at transition enablement.
