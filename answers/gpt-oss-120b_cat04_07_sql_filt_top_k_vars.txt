We need to produce a DuckDB SQL query that does the steps. Provide explanation and final query. Use window functions, string_agg with order by timestamp to get sequence. Then compute variant counts, rank, filter top K (parameter). Then join back to original events.

We need to ensure syntax for DuckDB: string_agg(expression, delimiter) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...) is supported. Or we can use LIST_AGG? DuckDB supports LIST_AGG and STRING_AGG. Use STRING_AGG(activity, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) as variant.

Then we need to compute variant frequencies: SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS case_cnt FROM (SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id) GROUP BY variant.

Then get top K: use QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_cnt DESC) <= K, or use a CTE.

Finally, filter original events: join event_log with case_variants where case_id in selected cases.

We need to return all events (all columns) for those cases.

Provide final query with placeholders for K (e.g., ? or a parameter). Use WITH clauses.

Let's craft final answer.
</think>

Below is a **single‑statement** DuckDB query (using CTEs) that performs all four steps you described.  
Replace the placeholder `:k` with the number of top variants you want (e.g. `5`).  

```sql
/* --------------------------------------------------------------
   1️⃣  Build the activity sequence (variant) for every case
   2️⃣  Count how many cases share each variant
   3️⃣  Keep only the K most frequent variants
   4️⃣  Return every original event that belongs to those cases
   -------------------------------------------------------------- */
WITH
-- 1️⃣  One row per case with its ordered activity list (the “variant”)
case_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

-- 2️⃣  Frequency of each distinct variant
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_cnt
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),

-- 3️⃣  Keep the K most frequent variants (ties are broken arbitrarily)
top_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_cnt DESC
    LIMIT :k               -- ← replace with the desired K (e.g. 5)
),

-- 4️⃣  Identify the case_ids that belong to those top‑K variants
selected_cases AS (
    SELECT
        cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN top_variants tv
      ON cv.variant = tv.variant
)

-- 5️⃣  Return **all** original events that belong to the selected cases
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN selected_cases sc
  ON el.case_id = sc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

### How the query works  

| CTE | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **case_variants** | For each `case_id` we concatenate the activities in chronological order (`STRING_AGG … ORDER BY timestamp`). The resulting string (e.g. `A,B,C,D`) is the *process variant* of that case. |
| **variant_counts** | Groups the rows of `case_variants` by the variant string and counts how many cases share it (`case_cnt`). |
| **top_variants** | Orders the variants by `case_cnt` descending and keeps the first `K` rows (`LIMIT :k`). |
| **selected_cases** | Retrieves the `case_id`s whose variant appears in the top‑K list. |
| Final `SELECT` | Joins the original `event_log` with `selected_cases` to output **all events** (original columns) that belong to the chosen cases, preserving the original ordering (`case_id`, then `timestamp`). |

#### Things to note  

* **Ordering inside the variant** – `STRING_AGG(activity, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp)` guarantees the exact chronological order of activities for each case.  
* **Performance** – DuckDB can push the `JOIN` down to the scan, so only the events of the selected cases are materialised in the final result.  
* **Parameter `:k`** – If you run the query from a client that supports named parameters (e.g., Python’s `duckdb.execute(sql, {"k": 5})`), just bind the value; otherwise replace `:k` with a literal integer.  

You can now run the query against your `event_log` table and obtain the filtered event log that contains only the cases belonging to the most frequent `K` process variants.
