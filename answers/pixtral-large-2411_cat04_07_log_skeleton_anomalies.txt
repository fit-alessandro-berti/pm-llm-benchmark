Based on the provided declarative constraints, here are some potential anomalies and inconsistencies in the proposed process model:

1. **Conflicting Constraints**:
   - **Equivalence and Never Together**: The activities 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' are both in an Equivalence relationship and a Never Together relationship. This is contradictory because Equivalence implies they should occur together, while Never Together implies they should not.
   - **Always Before and Always After**: The activities 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' and 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' are in an Always Before relationship, but 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' is also in an Always After relationship with 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'. This could create a loop or contradiction in the process flow.

2. **Redundant Constraints**:
   - **Equivalence and Directly-Follows**: If two activities are in an Equivalence relationship, having a Directly-Follows constraint between them is redundant. For example, 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' and 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' are in an Equivalence relationship and also have a Directly-Follows constraint.

3. **Activity Occurrences**:
   - Some activities have a wide range of occurrences, which might be too permissive. For example, 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' can occur up to 7 times, and 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' can occur up to 6 times. These ranges might need to be tightened based on business rules.
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' can occur 5 or 6 times, which seems unusual and might be a typo or need further investigation.

4. **Logical Inconsistencies**:
   - **Never Together and Activity Occurrences**: If two activities are in a Never Together relationship, their occurrence ranges should not overlap. For example, 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' are in a Never Together relationship, but both can occur 0 or 1 times, which means they could potentially co-exist in a case.

5. **Missing Constraints**:
   - There might be missing constraints based on business logic. For example, there is no constraint that enforces that a declaration must be submitted before it can be approved or rejected.

6. **Potential Deadlocks**:
   - The combination of constraints might create deadlocks. For example, if 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' is always before 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', and 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' is always after 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING', a deadlock could occur if 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING' is not executed.

To resolve these anomalies, you should review the business logic and adjust the constraints accordingly. It might also help to visualize the process model using a graph or a process mining tool to identify and resolve inconsistencies.
