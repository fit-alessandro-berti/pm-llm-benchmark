### **Assumptions & Considerations**:
1. **Chronological Order**: Events are sorted by timestamp to ensure proper sequence.
2. **Multiple Deliveries & Invoices**: Orders with multiple deliveries and invoices are captured separately.
3. **Event Naming**: Names were inferred based on business context.
4. **Missing Data**: Order 1004 does not have a delivery or invoice yet, so only order creation and picking events are recorded.
5. **Resources Mapping**: Used `resource_id` to include names where applicable.
