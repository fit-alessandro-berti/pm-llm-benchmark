To merge the two event logs into a single, enriched event log, we need to follow a systematic approach that considers the event types, timestamps, and order IDs. Below is the step-by-step process and the final merged event log.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Align Events Based on Timestamps and Order ID**:
   - Compare events from Log A and Log B with the same `order_id`.
   - Use a tolerance of 2 seconds for matching timestamps.

2. **Match and Merge Events**:
   - If events from Log A and Log B have matching timestamps (within the tolerance) and the same order ID, they are likely the same event. Merge their attributes.

3. **Handle Missing or Non-Overlapping Events**:
   - If an event is only present in one log, include it in the merged log with an indication of its origin.

4. **Choose Primary Timestamp**:
   - Use the primary timestamp from Log A for merging (since it is considered the primary timeline).

5. **Sort Events Chronologically**:
   - Arrange the merged events in chronological order based on the primary timestamp.

### Merged Event Log

#### Event Mapping and Merging:

1. **Order Received**
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, Order Received, Order#1234`
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, OrderReceived, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"`
   - Merged: `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, Order Received, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"`

2. **Order Validated**
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, Order Validated, Order#1234`
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, OrderValidation, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"`
   - Merged: `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, Order Validated, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"`

3. **Payment Processed**
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234`
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"`
   - Merged: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"` (Using Log A timestamp)

4. **Quality Check**
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"`
   - No matching event in Log A.
   - Included as-is: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"`

5. **Item Shipped**
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234`
   - Log B: `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, Shipping, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"`
   - Merged: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"`

6. **Item Delivered**
   - Log A: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234`
   - No matching event in Log B.
   - Included as-is: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234`

### Final Merged Event Log (Chronological Order)

```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, Order Received, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"
2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, Order Validated, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"
2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"
2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"
2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"
2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234
```

### Reasoning:

- **Matching and Merging**: Events were matched based on order ID and timestamp tolerance (within 2 seconds). Event names were aligned where possible (e.g., "Order Received" -> "OrderReceived").
- **Handling Missing or Non-Overlapping Events**: Events that did not have a suitable match in the other log were included as-is.
- **Timestamp Tolerance**: A tolerance of 2 seconds was used to account for slight offsets between systems.
- **Final Order**: Events are presented in chronological order based on the primary timestamp from Log A.

This approach ensures that the merged log is comprehensive, accurate, and enriched with attributes from both systems.
