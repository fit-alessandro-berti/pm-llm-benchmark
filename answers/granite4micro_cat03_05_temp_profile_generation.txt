**Explanation:**

- **SS-OP**: The selection and ordering process can vary significantly based on supplier lead times.
- **OP-RC**: Lead time from order placement to receiving components, which is influenced by shipping speeds and carrier performance.
- **RC-QI**: Inspection typically occurs shortly after receipt but may have some flexibility in scheduling.
- **QI-CA**: Time to assembly depends on inspection results and setup for assembly operations.
- **CA-PT**: Testing often follows immediately after assembly unless adjustments are needed.
- **PT-PK**: Packaging time can vary based on the need for special handling or expedited processing.
- **PK-WS**: Storage is usually immediate but may have a buffer for inventory management.
- **WS-DT**: Distribution lead times depend heavily on logistics and shipping routes.
- **DT-AS**: Support activities might be spread out, reflecting customer service practices.

The temporal profile provides insights into the critical paths in the supply chain process, highlighting where delays could occur and their variability.
