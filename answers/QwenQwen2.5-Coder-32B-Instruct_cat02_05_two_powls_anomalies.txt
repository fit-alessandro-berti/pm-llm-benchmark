### Analysis of POWL Models

#### Standard Hire-to-Retire Process
The standard Hire-to-Retire process involves a sequential set of activities where each decision and action must logically follow another:
1. **Post_Job_Ad** – Announce an open position.
2. **Screen_Candidates** – Evaluate applications and CVs.
3. **Conduct_Interviews** – Interview the selected candidates.
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision** – Decide which candidate to hire.
5. **Onboard_Employee** – Orient the new hire and prepare them for their role.
6. **Add_to_Payroll** – Add the new hire to the payroll system.
7. **Close_Case** – Finalize the hiring process and close the case.

Essential requirements:
- **Hiring decision** must be made after candidate screening and interviews.
- **Onboarding** must precede adding the employee to payroll.
- **Closing** cannot happen before onboarding and payroll.

### POWL Model 1
**Structure:**
```python
model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```

**Key Observations:**
1. **Screen** and **Interview** can occur in any order. This implies flexibility in conducting preliminary screenings (Screen) before interviews (Interview) are scheduled, which could lead to inefficiencies and increased time in the decision-making process.
2. **Post** and **Screen** must occur before **Decide**.
3. **Decide** must precede **Onboard**, **Onboard** must come before **Payroll**, and **Payroll** must be done before **Close**.

**Identified Anomalies:**
- The possibility for **Interview** to precede **Screen** could be seen as an anomaly as typical practice involves screening candidates before interviewing them.
- Logical flow appears generally correct after **Screen** and **Interview** phases.
- The order seems **mostly** consistent with the expected sequence for a valid Hire-to-Retire process, despite the possible reversal between **Screen** and **Interview**.

### POWL Model 2
**Structure:**
```python
model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close])
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview)
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```

**Loop and XOR:**
- **Loop_onboarding**: Allows the **Onboard_Employee** activity to repeat or be skipped.
- **XOR_payroll**: Forces a decision between adding to payroll or skipping that step.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Post** can lead directly to **Screen** or **Interview**. This does allow flexibility, but similar to Model 1, it can introduce confusion in the initial phases.
2. **Screen** and **Interview** must occur before **Decide**.
3. After **Decide**, the **Onboard_Employee** can be repeated or skipped due to the loop, and adding to the payroll can be bypassed by the XOR.
4. **Close** is reached after the loop and the XOR.

**Identified Anomalies:**
1. Like Model 1, **Post** splits into **Screen** and **Interview**, not severely deviating from practice, but introducing the same potential confusion.
2. **Looping onboarding** is a significant anomaly since repeating the onboarding phase is extremely rare and would be seen as flawed or improper practice.
3. **Skipping payroll** is another major anomaly. In typical HR processes, ignoring payroll would be a substantial mistake leading to financial issues for the employee.
4. The entire process could theoretically end before the vital step of onboarding and payroll, which fundamentally disrupts the process.

### Conclusion

**POWL Model 1** is closer to the normative Hire-to-Retire process. While it allows for **Screen** and **Interview** to occur in either order, this is less severe than the anomalies in Model 2. The fundamental sequence from **Post** through **Decide**, followed by **Onboard**, **Payroll**, and finally **Close** is intact. 

**POWL Model 2** introduces more severe anomalies:
- The possibility of looping onboarding which is nonsensical.
- The choice to skip payroll, which fundamentally threatens the integrity of the hiring process.

**Model 1** might still have some room for optimization regarding the initial phases, but Model 2 breaches core requirements, making it less aligned with the normative workflow. Therefore, **Model 1** is the better of the two models considering adherence to standards and process correctness.
