**Event Log for Process Mining**

Below is the structured event log derived from the provided tables. Each row represents an event within a process instance identified by `order_id`. The events are ordered chronologically, and resources have been included where available.

**Assumptions & Notes**

1. **Order Creation**: Each `order_id` from the `Orders` table initiated a new process instance, leading to the "Order Created" activity.
2. **Item Picking**: Derived activities based on timestamps in `Order Lines`. When multiple items were picked for an order on different dates and times, separate events were created for each action.
3. **Delivery Activities**: Split shipments from the `Delivery` table resulted in separate delivery activities per shipment, with corresponding carriers noted.
4. **Invoice and Payment**: Each invoice generated an "Invoice Issued" event. Payments could be single or multiple; thus, individual payment entries were logged as distinct events.
5. **Resource/Actor Mapping**: Resources (warehouse staff IDs) have been mapped to their respective roles from the `Resources` table where available. Otherwise, generic identifiers like "Warehouse Staff" were used.

**Key Considerations**

- This log assumes sequential execution of activities within each order for clarity and chronological accuracy.
- If there are any missing timestamps or ambiguous activity definitions (e.g., unclear "item picking"), they have been documented in assumptions above.
- The `Resource` column was populated based on the provided `Resources` table to enrich the traceability of who performed specific actions.
