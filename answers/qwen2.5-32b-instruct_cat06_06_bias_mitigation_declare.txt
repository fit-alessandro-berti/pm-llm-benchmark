To mitigate potential bias in the loan application review process, I will add new DECLARE constraints that ensure fairness and consistency in decision-making. These constraints will ensure that sensitive attributes are properly handled without leading to immediate biased outcomes and that additional checks are performed when necessary.

Below is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with added constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints:

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority` coexist with `ManualReview`: This ensures that when a decision is made for an applicant from a minority group, a manual review must always take place to ensure there is no bias in the decision.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - After `CheckApplicantRace`, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur: This ensures that any sensitive attribute disclosure triggers an additional check before any decision is made, ensuring that the decision-making process is fair and consistent.

3. **Non-Succession Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace` cannot directly succeed to `Reject`: This constraint prevents immediate biased rejection based solely on sensitive attributes, ensuring that the decision-making process includes additional checks and considerations.

These added constraints ensure that the loan application review process remains fair and unbiased, mitigating the risk of discrimination based on sensitive attributes.
