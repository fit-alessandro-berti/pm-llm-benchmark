# Process Event Log Analysis and Activity Renaming

After analyzing the event log from the financial services company's support workflow, I've identified several activities that appear multiple times within the same case but carry different contextual meanings. I'll rename these activities to better reflect their specific roles in the process.

## Activities Requiring Renaming

1. **Verify Documents** - Appears twice in cases C001 and C003, with different contexts:
   - Initial verification of submitted documents
   - Re-verification after additional information is provided

2. **Call Customer** - Appears in different contexts across all cases:
   - To request missing documentation
   - To clarify account information
   - For follow-up confirmation
   - To request customer return to branch

## Revised Event Log

## Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Initiate Request → Initiate Online Request/Initiate In-Branch Request**
   - Contextual clue: Different channels (WebPortal vs. BranchReception)
   - Justification: Distinguishes between online and in-person request initiation

2. **Verify Documents → Initial Document Verification/Secondary Document Verification/Post-Adjustment Verification**
   - Contextual clue: Timing in process flow and purpose (initial check vs. re-check after receiving additional documents)
   - Justification: Clarifies the sequential nature and purpose of each verification step

3. **Call Customer → Call for Missing Documents/Call for Account Clarification/Confirmation Call/Call for Customer Return**
   - Contextual clue: Different purposes stated in the additional context
   - Justification: Explicitly states the purpose of each call, making the process flow clearer

4. **Adjust Account → Account Data Adjustment/Account Data Correction**
   - Contextual clue: Different reasons for adjustment (after clarification vs. due to missing info)
   - Justification: Differentiates between proactive adjustment based on customer input and correction of errors

5. **Submit Additional → Submit Additional Documents**
   - Contextual clue: Specifically about document submission
   - Justification: More descriptive of what is being submitted

6. **Approve Request → Final Request Approval**
   - Contextual clue: Always the final step in the process
   - Justification: Emphasizes the finality of this approval step

These renamed activities provide clearer context about each step's purpose in the workflow, making the process more understandable and highlighting the different paths a case might take through the support system.
