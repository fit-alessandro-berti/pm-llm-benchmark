Here’s how the two logs compare, and why Group B (the “Unprotected” group) shows a built-in bias against Group A (the “Protected” group):

1. Score Adjustment Rules  
   - In Group B, any applicant who belongs to a recognized CommunityGroup (here, “Highland Civic Darts Club”) automatically receives a +10 “Community Boost.”  
   - In Group A, no one ever receives a score adjustment—CommunityGroup is always None, so their PreliminaryScore remains unchanged.  

2. Effect on Final Decisions  
   - Threshold behavior for approval appears to be 720 points.  
     • Protected applicants (Group A):  
       – P001: 720  Approved  
       – P002: 710  Rejected  
       – P003: 740  Approved  
     • Unprotected applicants (Group B):  
       – U001: 720 + 10  730  Approved  
       – U002: 710  Rejected (no community membership)  
       – U003: 695 + 10  705  **Approved** despite 705 < 720  

   Even though U003’s final (adjusted) score of 705 is still below the 720 threshold, the application is approved—an inconsistency not seen in Group A.

3. Role of LocalResident and CommunityGroup  
   - Every Group B applicant is marked LocalResident = TRUE, whereas all Group A are FALSE.  
   - Local residency alone carries no explicit +score, but it correlates with CommunityGroup membership: only local residents join local groups and thus only locals get the +10 boost.  
   - This means being local (LocalResident = TRUE) indirectly triggers better treatment—an extraneous factor unrelated to creditworthiness.

4. Systematic Differences & Bias  
   - Protected applicants (Group A) never benefit from community boosts or threshold relaxations, even when they have similar or higher raw scores.  
   - Unprotected applicants with community ties consistently get an advantage that both
     a) pushes borderline candidates (720  730) comfortably above the cut-off, and  
     b) even lets sub-threshold candidates (695  705) slip through.  
   - The result is that two applicants with the same raw score (e.g. P002 vs. U002 at 710) receive identical treatment (Rejection), but an applicant with a lower raw score in Group B (U003) ends up Approved while no Group A member ever is.

5. Conclusion  
   The bias resides in the conditional application of the +10 “Community Boost” (and the informal relaxation of the threshold for community-linked applicants). Because only Unprotected, local applicants belong to the designated CommunityGroup, they enjoy better outcomes than equivalently (or even more) qualified Protected applicants. This violates principles of fairness by allowing an attribute—local-group membership—that has no bearing on credit risk to sway decisions, systematically disadvantaging the protected group.
