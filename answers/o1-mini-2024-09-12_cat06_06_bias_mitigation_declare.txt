### Explanation of Added Constraints:

1. **Existence Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck, Approve_Minority, Reject_Minority:**
     - **Rationale:** These activities are introduced to handle sensitive attributes and ensure fairness. By specifying their existence, we ensure that the process includes necessary steps to mitigate bias.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **Approve_Minority ↔ ManualReview**
   - **Reject_Minority ↔ ManualReview**
     - **Rationale:** Ensures that whenever a decision is made for a minority applicant (`Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), a `ManualReview` activity is also present in the trace. This adds an additional layer of oversight to prevent biased decisions.

3. **Response Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace → BiasMitigationCheck**
     - **Rationale:** After checking an applicant's race (`CheckApplicantRace`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur. This ensures that any decision following the disclosure of sensitive attributes undergoes a bias assessment.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - **BiasMitigationCheck → Approve_Minority**
   - **BiasMitigationCheck → Reject_Minority**
     - **Rationale:** Ensures that decisions (`Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`) can only follow a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This enforces that bias mitigation steps are performed before any decision is made based on sensitive attributes.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace → Reject_Minority**
     - **Rationale:** Prevents a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority`, avoiding immediate biased rejection decisions without the intermediary bias mitigation step.

### How These Constraints Reduce Bias:

The added constraints introduce mandatory checks and reviews whenever sensitive attributes are involved in the decision-making process. By ensuring that:

- **Manual Reviews** accompany decisions affecting minority applicants, the process adds oversight to catch and correct potential biases.
- **Bias Mitigation Checks** are performed after disclosing sensitive attributes but before making a decision, ensuring that any influence of these attributes is appropriately managed.
- **Direct Succession Prevention** from sensitive attribute checks to rejection decisions eliminates the possibility of immediate biased outcomes without necessary intervention.

Overall, these constraints enforce a structured approach to handling sensitive information, promoting fairness and reducing the risk of discriminatory practices in the loan application review process.
