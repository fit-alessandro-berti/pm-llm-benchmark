### **Assumptions & Notes**
1. **Chronological Integrity**: The log maintains event sequence, ensuring each process follows a logical order (Order â†’ Picking â†’ Dispatch â†’ Delivery â†’ Invoice â†’ Payment).
2. **Multiple Shipments & Invoices**: Orders with split shipments (e.g., Order 1002) have separate events for each delivery. Similarly, multiple invoices/payments per order are treated as distinct events.
3. **Resources**:
   - Salespersons from the `Orders` table are linked to "Order Created".
   - Warehouse staff from `Order Lines` are linked to "Item Picked".
   - Carriers from `Delivery` are linked to "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived".
   - Billing clerks from `Invoice` are linked to "Invoice Issued".
   - Payment events do not have a specific resource but include payment method details.
4. **Partial Data Handling**: Order 1004 has no invoice or payment records, indicating it might be incomplete or in progress.

This event log structure is now suitable for process mining, allowing insights into order lifecycle, process bottlenecks, and actor performance. ðŸš€
