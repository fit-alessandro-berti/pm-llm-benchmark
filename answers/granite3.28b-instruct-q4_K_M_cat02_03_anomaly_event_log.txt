**Anomaly Identification:**

1. **Case 1002**: 
   - Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-01 08:40) before Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-03 07:00).
   - This sequence is problematic because a purchase order should not be issued until the purchase requisition has been approved. Issuing a PO without approval could lead to unauthorized purchases, incorrect quantities, and potential overspending.

2. **Case 1004**: 
   - Receive Goods (2024-02-06 09:00) before Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-06 09:15).
   - This sequence is unusual because goods should not be received until a purchase order has been issued. Receiving goods without a corresponding PO might result in issues like mismatched inventory, potential overpayment to vendors, or difficulties tracking specific orders.

**Explanation of Problems:**

1. **Case 1002**: The anomaly here is the premature issuance of a purchase order before the requisite approval step. This disrupts standard P2P process flow and introduces several risks:
   - Unauthorized purchases: Without proper authorization, there's no control over what gets ordered or in what quantities.
   - Errors: Unapproved requisitions might contain incorrect or imprecise information that could lead to order discrepancies or misunderstandings with vendors.
   - Compliance issues: Many organizations have internal controls and policies mandating approval before POs are issued to ensure fiscal responsibility and adherence to spending limits.

2. **Case 1004**: Receiving goods prior to the issuance of a purchase order violates standard P2P procedures and may result in:
   - Inventory mismatch: Without an associated PO, accurately tracking received items against orders becomes challenging, potentially leading to discrepancies or lost/missing inventory.
   - Payment issues: If invoice matching is done incorrectly (with the wrong PO), it could lead to overpayment or underpayment scenarios.
   - Accountability and traceability: Each step in the P2P cycle needs to be clearly documented for auditing purposes, and skipping the PO issuance step can complicate this traceability.
