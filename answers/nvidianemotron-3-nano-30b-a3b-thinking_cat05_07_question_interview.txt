We need to produce list of targeted open-ended questions to clarify and improve understanding. Should not ask for SQL implementation. Should cover missing details, decision criteria, roles/responsibilities, timing, sequencing, exceptions handling. Provide bullet list. Ensure open-ended. Probably grouped categories.

Proceed.

**Clarifying & Deepening Your Understanding of the PropertyOnBoarding Process**  
*(All questions are openended, aimed at uncovering missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, sequencing, and exception handling. No technical implementation or SQL requests.)*

---

### 1. Starting Point & Trigger Events  
- **What specific signal or request from a landlord initiates the onboarding workflow?**  
- **Are there different entry points (e.g., online portal, phone call, email) that lead to the same sequence, or do they each follow a slightly different pathway?**  
- **How do you prioritize which new property to bring into the portfolio when multiple owners reach out simultaneously?**

### 2. Documentation & Compliance  
- **Which document types are considered “mandatory” versus “nicetohave,” and what happens if a required document is missing or outdated?**  
- **Who is responsible for verifying local housingregulation compliance, and how do you stay current with regulatory changes across multiple jurisdictions?**  
- **Can you walk me through a recent instance where a landlord had to provide a nonstandard certificate (e.g., energy efficiency, firesafety) and how that impacted the onboarding timeline?**

### 3. PropertyData Capture  
- **What fields are recorded in the central property database, and how do you ensure consistency (e.g., naming conventions, unittype classifications) across markets?**  
- **How do you handle properties that have unconventional attributes (e.g., mixeduse spaces, coworking integrations) when entering data?**

### 4. Assigning Property Managers  
- **What exact criteria are used to match a property with a manager (workload, geography, experience, landlord preferences)?**  
- **Is there a formal scoring or routing system, or is the assignment more discretionary?**  
- **How do you capture and incorporate a landlord’s unique requirements (e.g., petfriendly, luxury finishes) into the manager’s brief?**

### 5. Introductory Meeting & ExpectationSetting  
- **What topics are always covered in the first managerlandlord call, and which are left for later negotiations?**  
- **How do you document the outcomes of that meeting (e.g., special clauses, preferred payment channels) to ensure they are reflected downstream?**  
- **What happens if the landlord and manager cannot agree on any of the discussed policy items?**

### 6. Photography & Inspection Workflow  
- **Who decides which photographer or inspection firm is used, and what standards do they need to meet?**  
- **How do you coordinate scheduling when the property is already occupied or when multiple properties share the same inspector?**  
- **Describe a situation where an inspection uncovered a critical issue—what was the decisionmaking process for repairing versus abandoning the property?**  

### 7. Marketing & Pricing  
- **What data sources feed the pricing model, and how often is it updated?**  
- **Who owns the final decision on the rent price (e.g., property manager, financial analyst, regional director)?**  
- **When a marketing campaign launches, how is the listing distributed across the various internal and external channels (CRMs, portals, partner sites)?**

### 8. Activation & Tenant Acquisition  
- **What are the exact steps from “listing live” to “tenant signed lease,” and can any of those steps run in parallel?**  
- **How do you handle highvolume interest (e.g., dozens of applications) while still maintaining a rigorous screening process?**  
- **What weight is given to factors like leaseterm length, rentpayment method, or tenant credit score in the final selection?**

### 9. Lease Finalization & Financials  
- **Who signs the lease on behalf of the company, and how is the security deposit captured and recorded?**  
- **Are there any leasecustomization triggers (e.g., landlord requests for unique clauses) that require extra approvals?**  

### 10. MoveIn & Handoff  
- **What checklist items are completed on the movein day (e.g., key transfer, inventory check, utility setup)?**  
- **How is the handoff coordinated between the leasing team, facilities, and the property manager?**

### 11. Ongoing Quality & Compliance Checks  
- **What types of internal audits are performed on completed onboarding, and how frequently?**  
- **When a compliance officer flags a leaserelated issue, what remediation steps are taken?**  
- **Can you give an example of a postoccupancy audit that led to a process change?**

### 12. Exception & EdgeCase Management  
- **What categories of exceptions (e.g., special insurance, atypical lease terms) require escalation to a higherlevel team?**  
- **How are these exceptions tracked so they don’t derail the standard workflow?**  
- **Describe a recent “exception” that forced the team to deviate from the default process—what was the outcome?**  

### 13. Communication & Tracking Across Stakeholders  
- **Which tools (CRM, projectmanagement software, email) capture the endtoend communication flow for a property?**  
- **How do you ensure that all parties—regional office, landlord, property manager, support teams—have visibility into the current status and next steps?**  

### 14. Continuous Improvement  
- **What metrics or feedback loops are used to measure the efficiency of the onboarding process?**  
- **How are insights from those metrics fed back into revising the process or training staff?**

**Use these questions to probe each stage of the workflow, uncover hidden decision points, map out responsibilities, and surface how the organization handles variability and exceptions.**  
They’ll help you build a richer mental model of the process without needing any technical implementation details.
