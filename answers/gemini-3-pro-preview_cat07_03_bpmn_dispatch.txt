Based on the provided image, here is a description of the **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)** diagram titled **"Dispatch of goods"** for a **"Computer Hardware Shop."**

### Overview
The diagram illustrates the workflow for shipping goods, involving three distinct participants (represented as horizontal lanes):
1.  **Logistics** (Top Lane)
2.  **Secretary** (Middle Lane)
3.  **Warehouse** (Bottom Lane)

### Process Flow
The process begins in the **Secretary** lane with a Start Event labeled **"Ship goods."**

**1. Parallel Split:**
Immediately after starting, a **Parallel Gateway (+)** splits the workflow into two simultaneous paths:
*   **Path A:** Moves to the **Warehouse** lane.
*   **Path B:** Continues in the **Secretary** lane.

---

#### Path A: Warehouse Operations
*   The warehouse worker performs the task **"Package goods."**
*   **Timer Event:** There is a timer attached to this task labeled **"48 hours."**
    *   If the packaging takes longer than 48 hours, the flow triggers a task to **"Notify customer about delay"** before rejoining the main path.
*   Once packaging (and notification, if applicable) is complete, the flow moves to a waiting point (Parallel Gateway) to synchronize with the Secretary's tasks.

---

#### Path B: Secretary Operations
*   The secretary starts with the task **"Clarify shipment method,"** which utilizes data from an **"Order details"** document.
*   **Decision Point (Exclusive Gateway):** The flow reaches a gateway asking **"Special handling?"**
    *   **If YES (Special Handling):**
        1.  Task: **"Get 3 offers from logistic companies."**
        2.  Task: **"Select logistic company and place order."**
        3.  The flow then proceeds to merge with the 'No' branch.
    *   **If NO (Standard Handling):**
        1.  Task: **"Check if insurance is required,"** accessing a **"Customer information"** database.
        2.  **Inclusive Gateway (Split):** This allows one or both of the following sub-paths to run:
            *   **Always:** The secretary performs the task **"Write package label."**
            *   **If insurance necessary:** The flow moves up to the **Logistics** lane where the task **"Insure parcel"** is performed.
        3.  These paths merge back together at a joining Inclusive Gateway.

---

### Synchronization and Completion
*   Both the **"Special handling"** path and the **"Standard handling"** path in the Secretary lane merge at an Exclusive Gateway.
*   **Parallel Join:** The completed flow from the **Secretary** lane and the completed flow from the **Warehouse** lane meet at a **Parallel Gateway (+)** in the Warehouse lane. This ensures that paperwork/logistics and physical packaging are both done before proceeding.

**Final Steps (Warehouse Lane):**
1.  Task: **"Fill out Shipment paperwork."**
2.  Task: **"Move package to pickup area."**
3.  **End Event:** The process concludes with the event **"Shipment prepared."**
