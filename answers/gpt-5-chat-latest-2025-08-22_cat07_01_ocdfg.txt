This visualization represents a **business process flow diagram** showing the lifecycle of different types of order and invoice items. It tracks how data objects (like sales orders, purchase orders, requisitions, returns, and invoices) move through various steps in the process, highlighting volumes and processing times at each stage.  

### Key Elements:
1. **Data Sources at the Top:**
   - The process begins with different inputs:  
     - **VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M objects)**  
     - **ReturnOrderItem (0.8M objects)**  
     - **PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M objects)**  
     - **SalesOrderItem (3.5M objects)**  
     - **PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M objects)**  
   - Each of these object types feeds into the workflow, initiating different process steps.  

2. **Process Steps (Middle Layer):**
   - **Create Requisition (3.0M overall)**  **Approve Requisition (5.7M overall)**  
   - **Create Order (8.5M overall)**  **Pack Goods**  **Ship Goods**  **Confirm Delivery**  **Close Order**  
   - **Send Order (5.2M overall)**  
   - **Check Stock (1.0M overall)**  
   - **Process Return (0.8M overall)**  
   - **Approve Payment (1.5M overall)**  
   - **Create Invoice (2.0M overall)**  

   Each process step shows the overall volume of items processed.

3. **Process Durations (Times on Arrows):**
   - Numbers like **400ms, 200ms, 300ms** etc. indicate the average processing or transition times between steps.
   - For example:  
     - It takes **400ms** from **Create Order  Pack Goods**.  
     - It takes **800ms** from **Approve Requisition  Approve Payment**.  
     - **10ms** from **Process Return  Confirm Delivery (link back)**.  

4. **Process Endpoints (Bottom Layer):**
   - Multiple **End states** represent where processes terminate after final steps:  
     - End after **Send Order**  
     - End after **Approve Payment  Create Invoice**  
     - End after **Confirm Delivery  Close Order**  

5. **Flow Characteristics:**
   - **Parallel and Conditional Flows:**  
     - For example, after **Approve Requisition**, items can move into **Send Order**, **Check Stock**, **Process Return**, or **Approve Payment**, depending on the business scenario.  
   - **Feedback Loops:**  
     - There's a loop between **Process Return** and other downstream processes like **Create Invoice** and **Confirm Delivery**, reflecting iterative handling steps.  

### Summary:
This diagram shows how different order and requisition items pass through procurement, sales, payment processing, and returns. It visualizes **object volumes, transition times, and dependencies** between processes, helping identify bottlenecks and optimize operations.  

Would you like me to **highlight inefficiencies (e.g., longest delays, highest volumes) and where the bottlenecks might be**?
