Here is a consolidated event log for process mining. Each row is an event, keyed by Case ID (order_id). Activities are inferred from the tables, with timestamps and a Resource (Person, Department, or Carrier) when available. Where helpful, additional attributes (item, delivery/invoice/payments details) are included.

Notes and assumptions
- Case ID is the order_id as requested.
- Activity names are inferred from table contexts: Order Created, Item Picked, Order Dispatched, Order Arrived, Invoice Issued, Payment Received.
- Each item picked in Order Lines is represented as a separate Item Picked event with item_id and quantity.
- For deliveries, two events per delivery are included: “Order Dispatched” and “Order Arrived” with the delivery_id and carrier (CR-xx) captured. If multiple deliveries exist for an order, each contributes its own pair of events in chronological order.
- Invoices and payments are linked to their respective orders; a single order may have multiple invoices and/or payments.
- Resource/Actor column uses the mapping from the Resources table (e.g., SP-001 -> Alice Brown, WH-001 -> David Lin, CR-01 -> GlobalTransport, BL-001 -> Gina Carter, etc.).
- Where data is not applicable for an event (e.g., no item, no delivery, or no invoice), the corresponding fields are left blank.
- For 1004, there is a listed order and a single item picked but no deliveries, invoices, or payments in the provided data; hence only Order Created and Item Picked events are present for that order.

If you’d like, I can provide this in CSV or JSON as well, or adjust the Attribute columns to a single JSON column per row.
