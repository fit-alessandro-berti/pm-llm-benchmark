## 1. Reconstructing and Quantifying Actual Scheduling Performance with Process Mining

### 1.1 Event Log Preparation and Perspective Alignment  
- **Case notion**: Use `Job ID` as the case to reconstruct each order’s routing; optionally create *sub-cases* for long jobs (e.g., job-operation pairs) for finer-grained analysis.
- **Activity perspective**: Normalize task names (e.g., `Cutting  Setup Start`, `Cutting  Processing Start`, etc.) to capture both core operations and setup/changeover segments.
- **Resource perspective**: Extract machine IDs, operator IDs; derive *resource pools* (e.g., all CNC mills) to analyze at aggregate and individual levels.
- **Temporal attributes**: Ensure timestamp ordering, handle parallel events, compute inter-event durations.

### 1.2 Process Discovery and Flow Reconstruction  
- **Discovery technique**:  
  - Use **Variant-driven Petri nets** (Inductive Miner) to reveal typical routing patterns and deviations.
  - Augment with **Heuristic Miner** focusing on frequency to capture preferential sequences in complex variants.
  - Build **resource-aware process maps** showing which machines appear in which sequence for each routing family.
- **Performance overlays**: Superimpose throughput times, waiting times, and setup durations on discovered models (through performance mining dashboards).

### 1.3 Flow/Makespan Metrics  
- For each job, compute:
  - **Flow time** = Completion – Release (from log status events).
  - **Inter-operation waiting**: difference between `Queue Entry` and `Setup Start`/`Task Start`.
  - Summarize distributions (mean, median, percentile profile) per product family.
- Compute **makespan** per day/week (span between first and last task) to assess shop load variability.

### 1.4 Queue and Wait-time Analysis  
- Use **transition system** from `Queue Entry` to `Setup Start` to `Task Start` to measure queue lengths and waiting durations.
- Generate **work center-specific histograms** of queue times; mark time-of-day/weekday patterns.

### 1.5 Utilization (Machine/Operator)  
- Build **timeline utilization charts** (e.g., time slicing per 5min):
  - Productive time = `Task Start` to `Task End`.
  - Setup time = `Setup Start` to `Setup End`.
  - Idle time = from `Task End` to next `Setup/Task Start`.
- Use **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**-style metrics:
  - Availability = 1 – breakdown downtime.
  - Performance = planned vs actual processing time (speed losses).
  - Quality = rework loops (if captured).
- Combine operator coverage to identify resource contention.

### 1.6 Sequence-dependent Setup Modeling  
- Construct **machine-wise sequence matrices**: for each ordered pair of consecutive jobs `(prev, next)` on machine, compute average setup duration and variability.
- Use **clustering** of job attributes (material, tolerance, dimensions) to derive *setup families* and regress expected setup time on features (`Job_{n-1}` features, `Job_n` features, time since last similar job).
- Evaluate **changeover penalties**: difference between actual setup time and baseline (e.g., setups within same family vs across families).

### 1.7 Schedule Adherence & Tardiness  
- Compute **lateness** = Completion – Due Date, with tardiness = max(lateness, 0). Measure frequency, mean tardiness, max tardiness, per priority class.
- Compare actual vs planned start/finish times (if plan data exists) using **conformance checking** to detect deviations from planned schedule.

### 1.8 Disruption Impact Analysis  
- Tag events (breakdowns, urgent job arrivals) and perform **what-followed** analyses:  
  - For each disruption, calculate delta waiting times and tardiness for jobs downstream.
  - Use **time window comparisons**: pre- vs post-breakdown resource utilization, WIP levels.
- Identify **rescheduling delays** using event sequences: e.g., time from breakdown to last resumed job.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies via Process Mining Evidence

1. **Bottleneck Identification**  
   - High queue times & high utilization signals on machines (e.g., `MILL-02`).
   - Use **Throughput bottleneck miner**: segments timeline into intervals where certain machines govern flow time.
   - Quantify contribution: e.g., `MILL-02` causes average 30% of job flow time due to queue + processing.

2. **Priority Inversion / Poor Task Prioritization**  
   - Variant analysis comparing on-time vs late jobs reveals high-priority jobs waiting behind lower-priority ones.
   - View **Gantt overlays** colored by priority to prove urgent jobs frequently queued > threshold.

3. **Setup Inefficiencies**  
   - Sequence matrix shows large setup times when switching between incompatible jobs; frequency indicates no attempt to batch similar jobs.
   - Instances with actual setups 50% longer than planned highlight sequencing issues.

4. **Starvation & Blocking**  
   - Resource timeline showing machines idle because upstream tasks finish late (lack of WIP).
   - Event logs show `Queue Entry` absent for some machines while others have long batches, indicating imbalance.

5. **WIP Bullwhip**  
   - Variation in WIP (queue sizes) over time correlating with irregular release or dynamic dispatching.
   - Visualize with **token-based replay** to show accumulation at particular buffers.

6. **Disruption Handling Failures**  
   - After breakdowns, increased tardiness for jobs once due soon; lack of reprioritization.
   - Hot jobs show frequent resequencing but cause ripple tardiness due to short notice dispatching.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

1. **Static Dispatching Rule Limitations**  
   - FCFS/EDD sequences ignore setup dependencies, load, job priority interplay. Logs show numerous cases where high-priority jobs are delayed due to the rigid queue order.
   - Process mining quantifies average tardiness difference between naive rules vs realized outcomes.

2. **Limited Visibility**  
   - Evidence: long reaction times post-breakdown before reallocation; indicates absence of real-time dynamic scheduling board.
   - Variation in actual vs planned durations indicates no immediate feedback to scheduler.

3. **Inaccurate Duration Estimates**  
   - Compare planned vs actual durations; high variance & bias (actual consistently > planned) leads to unrealistic schedules.

4. **Setup Handling**  
   - Lack of job family grouping observed in sequences; machine state transitions show random order.

5. **Cross-center Coordination**  
   - Cropped or unbalanced WIP due to independent work center decisions; process mining shows asynchronous schedule shifts.

6. **Disruption Response**  
   - Hot jobs causing ripple delays: logs show instantaneous reallocation but no predictive evaluation of impact.

### Distinguishing Scheduling vs Capacity Issues  
- Use **capacity utilization contrasted with queue lengths**: if machine is 98% utilized with persistent queue, indicates capacity constraint; if utilization ~60% but tardiness high, scheduling logic at fault.
- Analyze **stochastic variability**: variance analysis of processing times and inter-arrival times to determine if inherent variability alone explains delays (e.g., coefficient of variation metrics). If actual variability manageable but tardiness still high, scheduling cause dominates.

## 4. Advanced Data-driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Multi-factor Dynamic Dispatching (Adaptive Priority Index)

**Core Logic**  
- For each machine queue, assign a **composite priority score** `PI` for each job:  
  ```
  PI = w1 * (slack time) + w2 * (downstream criticality) + w3 * (predicted setup penalty) 
       + w4 * (job priority level) + w5 * (remaining processing time / total remaining load)
  ```
- Slack = (Due date – Current time – Estimated remaining processing). Downstream criticality = 1 / minimal slack at downstream bottleneck machines (from analytics). Setup penalty predicted via regression on sequence dependent setups.

**Process Mining Inputs**  
- Historical waiting times & tardiness inform `w` weights (via optimization or simulation).
- Setup regression from sequence analysis provides accurate penalty estimates for each sequence.
- Resource load forecasting derived from aggregated queue lengths.

**Addressed Pathologies**  
- Reduces priority inversion; ensures high-impact jobs expedited.
- Minimizes cumulative changeover penalties by incorporating predicted setup costs.
- Balances load by considering downstream needs (avoids starving critical resources).

**Expected KPIs**  
- Tardiness reduction 15%.
- WIP smoothing across stations.
- Slightly increased utilization of non-bottleneck machines due to balanced scheduling.

### Strategy 2: Predictive Real-time Scheduling (ETA & Risk-driven Rescheduling)

**Core Logic**  
- Build **ETA prediction models** (e.g., gradient-boosted trees or temporal convolution) using historical durations, including contextual features (operator, material, tool type).
- Train **breakdown probability models** using machine event logs (time since last maintenance, usage hours).
- Implement **rolling horizon scheduler** that uses predicted durations and downtime risks to generate feasible schedules with slack buffers.

**Process Mining Inputs**  
- Duration distributions (per activity-resource-operator) derived from logs.
- Breakdown patterns mined via survival analysis from `Breakdown Start/End` events.
- Use **predictive process monitoring** to flag jobs at risk of tardiness (high predicted lateness) and trigger rescheduling.

**Addressed Pathologies**  
- Mitigates inaccurate planning; ensures schedules reflect actual performance.
- Anticipates disruptions; proactive reallocation reduces ripple effect from breakdowns.
- Enables dynamic communication to customers with realistic promise dates.

**Expected KPIs**  
- Lead time variability reduction (lower standard deviation).
- Improved on-time delivery probability (target +20% for high priority).
- Higher confidence in completion estimates, supporting better customer commitments.

### Strategy 3: Sequence-dependent Setup Optimization (Smart Batching & Look-ahead)

**Core Logic**  
- Define **setup families** via clustering (e.g., k-means on feature vector: machining parameters, material).
- For bottleneck machines (e.g., `MILL-02`), apply **rolling batching**:
  - Plan micro-batches of similar jobs within a look-ahead window (e.g., next 6 hours).
  - Use **sequence optimization (e.g., ILP or heuristic like NEH)** to minimize total setup time subject to due dates, with penalty terms for tardiness risk.
- Integrate with Strategy 1 (priority index) by adjusting `PI` to encourage same-family sequencing when within slack thresholds.

**Process Mining Inputs**  
- Sequence matrix supplies expected changeover times for each pair  cost matrix for sequencing.
- Identify historical patterns where grouping similar jobs reduced setups  baseline for improvement.

**Addressed Pathologies**  
- Drastically cuts changeover load on bottlenecks (target 20–30% reduction).
- Frees capacity, reducing queue times & WIP.
- Minimizes manual reconfiguration, enabling operators to maintain efficiency.

**Expected KPIs**  
- Increase effective capacity at bottleneck machine (higher throughput).
- Shorter queues and less variability at critical resources.
- Secondary effect: lower WIP due to faster progression.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### 5.1 Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) for Strategy Testing

**Model Setup**  
- Build DES using **AnyLogic, FlexSim, or SimPy**; parameterized from process mining outputs:
  - Task duration distributions per activity-resource (empirical or fitted).
  - Routing probabilities (from discovered model).
  - Setup sequences and penalty matrix.
  - Breakdown processes (time-to-failure, repair durations).
  - Arrival process of jobs with priority mix.

**Scenario Testing**  
- Baseline (current dispatching) vs each strategy under:
  - **Nominal load** (average release rate).
  - **High load** (peak demand weeks).
  - **Disruption-heavy** (increased breakdown frequency, urgent hot jobs).
  - **Data drift** (e.g., new product mix reducing similarity).
- Evaluate metrics: average tardiness, 95th percentile tardiness, WIP, throughput, machine utilization, queue length variance.

**Optimization**  
- Use simulation-based optimization (e.g., GA, OptQuest) to fine-tune strategy parameters (weights, batch window, buffer size).

### 5.2 Continuous Monitoring & Adaptive Loop

1. **Dashboarding & KPI Tracking**  
   - Build dashboards (e.g., Power BI + ProM/Suite) streaming from MES: On-time delivery rate, WIP per work center, queue lengths, OEE.
   - Implement **Process Mining in the loop**: periodic re-run of bottleneck detection, sequence matrix refresh.

2. **Drift Detection**  
   - Use **concept drift detection** on predictive models (monitor AUC, MAE).
   - Set triggers when actual durations deviate from predicted tolerance  re-estimate models.
   - Monitor sequence changeover times distribution; alarms when new job types degrade setup assumptions.

3. **Feedback to Scheduling Logic**  
   - Integrate with MES: scheduling engine receives real-time events; re-calibrates index weights via reinforcement learning or adaptive control if KPIs degrade.

4. **Continuous Improvement Cadence**  
   - Monthly review of variant deviations, tardy case deep-dives.
   - Quarterly re-baselining of dispatch parameters and look-ahead horizon.
   - Annual re-validation of simulation with new log data for long-term trends.
