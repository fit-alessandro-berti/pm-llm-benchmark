Certainly! Below is the DuckDB SQL query that meets the requirements specified:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM 
        case_event_counts
    WHERE 
        event_count <= 6
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    filtered_cases fc
ON 
    el.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Case Event Counts (CTE `case_event_counts`)**:
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the total number of events (`COUNT(*)`) for each `case_id` in the `event_log` table.
   - The result is a temporary table with columns `case_id` and `event_count`.

2. **Filtered Cases (CTE `filtered_cases`)**:
   - This CTE filters out the `case_id`s where the event count is greater than six.
   - The result is a list of `case_id`s that meet the criteria.

3. **Final Selection**:
   - The final `SELECT` statement joins the original `event_log` table (`el`) with the `filtered_cases` CTE on `case_id`.
   - This join ensures that only events from the cases with six or fewer events are returned.

This query efficiently filters and retrieves the required events based on the criteria provided.
