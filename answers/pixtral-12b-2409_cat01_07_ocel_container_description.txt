The data provided appears to represent an object-centric event log from a logistics or supply chain process. The event log captures various activities involving different types of objects such as Handling Units, Trucks, Containers, Vehicles, Forklifts, Customer Orders, and Transport Documents. Each activity is recorded with its frequency and duration.

Here is a high-level description of the process underlying this data:

### 1. Handling Unit
- **Collect Goods**: This is the initial activity where goods are collected for a handling unit. Once goods are collected, they are then loaded onto a truck.
- **Load Truck**: After goods are collected, they are loaded onto a truck.

### 2. Truck
- **Load Truck**: Trucks are loaded with goods from handling units. The frequency (number of events) for "Load Truck" across all object types indicates multiple instances of trucks being loaded.
- **Drive to Terminal**: After being loaded, trucks drive to the terminal. This is a recurring activity as indicated by the frequency of events from "Drive to Terminal" back to "Load Truck".
- **Load Truck**: Again, trucks are reloaded at the terminal.

### 3. Container
- **Load Truck**: Containers are also loaded onto trucks in multiple instances.
- **Order Empty Containers**: Empty containers are ordered to be picked up.
- **Pick Up Empty Container**: Empty containers are picked up.
- **Load Truck**: Containers are loaded onto trucks.
- **Drive to Terminal**: Containers drive to the terminal after being loaded onto trucks.
- **Weigh**: Containers are weighed upon arrival at the terminal.
- **Load to Vehicle**: Containers are loaded to vehicles at the terminal.
- **Depart**: Vehicles depart for their destinations.
- **Bring to Loading Bay**: Containers are brought to the loading bay.
- **Place in Stock**: Containers are placed in stock.
- **Reschedule Container**: Occasionally, containers are rescheduled for different vehicles or times.

### 4. Vehicle
- **Load to Vehicle**: Vehicles are loaded with goods or containers.
- **Book Vehicles**: Vehicles are booked for transport.
- **Depart**: Vehicles depart for their destinations.
- **Reschedule Container**: Vehicles are sometimes rescheduled.

### 5. Forklift
- **Bring to Loading Bay**: Forklifts bring goods or containers to the loading bay.
- **Weigh**: Forklifts weigh the goods or containers.
- **Load to Vehicle**: Forklifts load goods or containers to vehicles.
- **Place in Stock**: Forklifts place goods or containers in stock.

### 6. Customer Order
- **Register Customer Order**: Customer orders are registered.
- **Create Transport Document**: Transport documents are created for registered customer orders.

### 7. Transport Document

- **Book Vehicles**: Vehicles are booked based on the transport documents.
- **Order Empty Containers**: Empty containers are ordered.
- **Depart**: Vehicles depart based on the transport documents.
- **Reschedule Container**: Containers are rescheduled based on the transport documents.

### Process Flow
1. **Customer Order Registration**: Customer orders are registered, and transport documents are created.
2. **Vehicle and Container Management**: Vehicles are booked and empty containers are ordered.
3. **Goods Handling**: Goods are collected, weighed, and loaded onto trucks by forklifts.
4. **Transportation**: Trucks drive to the terminal, where they are unloaded, and containers are weighed, placed in stock, or brought to the loading bay.
5. **Departure**: Vehicles depart with the loaded containers to their destinations.
