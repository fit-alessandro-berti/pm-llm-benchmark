To identify the root causes of the performance issues within this process based on the provided data, we need to analyze each step where significant delays or rejections occur. Here's a breakdown focusing on specific areas:

1. **Initial Rejection by ADMINISTRATION**:
   - The path "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" has a very high performance time of 13,805,869.2 seconds (frequency = 5). This suggests that initial submissions often fail due to administrative checks.
   - Possible root cause: Incomplete or non-compliant initial submissions from employees.

2. **REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**:
   - Rejections by supervisors are frequent and involve multiple resubmissions, such as the path "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE". This path has a performance time of 295,700.25 seconds (frequency = 8).
   - Possible root cause: Mismatch between supervisor expectations and submitted declarations or inadequate initial review by administrators.

3. **REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**:
   - Paths like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" (frequency = 8, performance = 295,700.25 seconds) show frequent rejections.
   - Possible root cause: Budget constraints or discrepancies between declared costs and approved budgets.

4. **REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**:
   - Frequent rejection paths involving pre-approver include "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" (frequency = 8, performance = 71,336.875 seconds).
   - Possible root cause: Initial submissions not meeting criteria set by the pre-approver or insufficient clarity in declaration forms.

5. **REJECTED due to MISSING**:
   - The path "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" indicates missing information, causing delays.
   - Possible root cause: Incomplete documentation or missing required supporting documents.

6. **Frequent Resubmissions**:
   - Multiple paths involving repeated submissions and rejections (e.g., "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER" followed by resubmissions) suggest inefficiencies in the initial submission process.
   - Possible root cause: Lack of clear guidelines or insufficient preliminary review processes.

7. **Final Approval Delays**:
   - Paths where final approval is delayed, like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR", indicate that supervisors may be the bottleneck.
   - Possible root cause: Inefficient supervisor workflows or insufficient resources for timely review.

By addressing these specific issues within each step—such as providing clearer guidelines, improving initial checks by pre-approver and administration, ensuring compliance with budget constraints, and streamlining resubmission processes—you can potentially mitigate performance bottlenecks in the overall process.
