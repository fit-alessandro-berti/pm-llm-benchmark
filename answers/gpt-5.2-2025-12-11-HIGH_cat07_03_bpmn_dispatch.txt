The visualization is a **BPMN-style process diagram with swimlanes** that describes how a shop dispatches goods, involving three roles:

- **Logistics** (top lane)
- **Shop secretary** (middle lane, labeled “Dispatch of goods – computer hardware shop – Secretary”)
- **Warehouse** (bottom lane)

### Main flow (from left to right)
1. **Start event:** “Ship goods”.
2. A **parallel split** occurs (plus-sign gateway), launching two activities in parallel:
   - **Shop secretary branch:** **Clarify shipment method**.
   - **Warehouse branch:** **Package goods**.

3. After “Clarify shipment method”, an **exclusive decision** asks **“Special handling?”**
   - **Yes:**  
     - **Get 3 offers from logistic companies**  
     - **Select logistic company and place order**
   - **No:**  
     - **Check if insurance is required** (uses **Order details** and **Customer information** data objects)
     - If insurance is necessary, the process goes to **Logistics: “Insure parcel”**
     - In any case, **Write package label** is performed

4. The logistics-selection/label/insurance paths **merge** and proceed downward to synchronize later with the warehouse work.

### Warehouse timing/escalation
- The **“Package goods”** task has a **48-hour timer boundary event**.
  - If packaging takes too long, it triggers **“Notify customer about delay”**, then rejoins the main warehouse flow.

### Completion
5. The parallel branches **join** (plus-sign gateway) and continue with:
   - **Fill out shipment paperwork**
   - **Move package to pickup area**
6. **End event:** “Shipment prepared”.

Overall, it shows a coordinated shipping preparation process with conditional insurance handling, optional special handling logistics selection, and a packaging delay notification mechanism.
