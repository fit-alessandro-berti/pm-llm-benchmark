Based on the directly follows graph you provided, it appears that the process involves several types of objects, including Handling Units, Trucks, Containers, Vehicles, Forklifts, Customer Orders, and Transport Documents. Here is a high-level description of the process:

1. Handling Units: The process begins with the "Collect Goods" event for Handling Units. This is followed by the "Load Truck" event, which occurs 10553 times for 10553 unique Handling Units. The duration of this step is 7820.93 seconds.
2. Trucks: After Handling Units are loaded, the Trucks undergo several events. There are 8559 instances of the "Load Truck" event for 6 unique Trucks, which is followed by another "Load Truck" event or "Drive to Terminal" event. The "Drive to Terminal" event occurs 1989 times for 6 unique Trucks. There are also instances where "Drive to Terminal" is followed by another "Load Truck" event for the same Trucks. The duration of these steps varies, with the shortest being 5259.71 seconds for "Load Truck" and the longest being 84119.09 seconds for "Drive to Terminal" to "Load Truck".
3. Containers: Containers are loaded onto Trucks and undergo a series of events, some of which are repeated multiple times for different Containers. These events include "Load Truck," "Order Empty Containers," "Pick Up Empty Container," "Drive to Terminal," "Weigh," "Load to Vehicle," "Depart," "Bring to Loading Bay," and "Place in Stock." The duration of these steps varies, with the longest being 743380.51 seconds for "Place in Stock" to "Bring to Loading Bay."
4. Vehicles: Vehicles are booked, and Containers are loaded. The process includes events such as "Book Vehicles," "Load to Vehicle," "Depart," and "Reschedule Container." The duration of these steps varies, with the longest being 40895.81 seconds for "Reschedule Container" to "Reschedule Container."
5. Forklifts: Forklifts are involved in loading and moving items around the terminal. The events include "Bring to Loading Bay," "Load to Vehicle," "Weigh," and "Place in Stock." The duration of these steps varies, with the longest being 112600.53 seconds for "Place in Stock" to "Bring to Loading Bay."
6. Customer Orders and Transport Documents: Customer Orders are registered, and Transport Documents are created. The Transport Document is then used to book Vehicles, order empty Containers, and depart. The duration of these steps varies, with the longest being 1051301.41 seconds for "Depart" to "Depart."

In summary, the process involves handling units, loading them onto Trucks, and moving them to the terminal while managing Containers, Vehicles, and Forklifts. Simultaneously, Customer Orders are registered, and Transport Documents are created to facilitate the transportation of goods.
