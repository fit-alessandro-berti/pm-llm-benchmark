Anomalies in the DECLARE model
1) Noncoexistence(E, C) vs Existence(C)
- Existence(C) mandates that C must occur in every trace.
- Noncoexistence(E, C) forbids E and C from co-occurring in the same trace.
- Combined with Responded existence(E -> A), if any evaluation E happens, the trace cannot contain C, but Existence(C) requires C anyway. Therefore, any trace with E becomes impossible, forcing all traces to avoid E. This contradicts the intended process where E should precede approval and closure.

2) Responded existence(E -> A) directionality mismatch with intended flow
- Intended flow requires A (Assign) before E (Evaluate).
- Responded existence as specified means if E occurs, then A must occur somewhere (not necessarily before E). This allows E before A, violating the intended order.

3) Precedence(C <- R) is too weak
- It only requires that C is preceded by R at least once in the trace.
- It does not enforce the rest of the intended ordering (A before E, E before P, P before N, N before C). This permits many undesired paths, including R followed by C with no A/E/P/N.

4) Init(R) combined with Existence(C) but no constraints on intermediate steps
- With E effectively prohibited by Noncoexistence(E, C), the model still allows R followed directly by C, skipping A, P, N, which undermines essential steps.

Net effect
- E is practically banned.
- A can be absent unless E happens; even if E happens, A can be after E.
- C must always happen and only needs to be after some R.
- The intended sequence is not enforced.

Hypotheses for why these anomalies exist
1) Misinterpretation of requirement semantics
- Responded existence used instead of precedence/succession for A and E.
- Noncoexistence(E, C) added to prevent evaluation after closure, but incorrectly forbids them in the same trace rather than enforcing order.

2) Incremental policy changes not propagated
- A rule to always close claims (Existence(C)) added later without updating constraints that limit E.

3) Data-driven mining artifacts
- Constraints mined from incomplete or biased logs where evaluation was rare or split across systems, yielding spurious Noncoexistence(E, C) and weak precedence.

4) Performance pressure shortcuts
- Business pressure to fast-track closures might have relaxed constraints to permit R -> C directly, unintentionally blocking E or under-specifying ordering.

5) Ambiguous activity coding
- E used for multiple sub-states or mislabeled in some systems, leading to contradictory constraints when combined.

SQL-based verification approaches
Note: Replace :start_date/:end_date as needed. All queries assume one process instance per claim_id ordered by timestamp.

A) Claims closed without evaluation (detects both model allowance and practical occurrence)
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'C') = TRUE
   AND BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') = FALSE;

B) Traces where E and C coexist (violates Noncoexistence(E, C))
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') = TRUE
   AND BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'C') = TRUE;

C) E occurring without any A (violates business intent; checks Responded existence necessity)
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') = TRUE
   AND BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'A') = FALSE;

D) E occurring before A (tests ordering mismatch allowed by Responded existence)
WITH ordered AS (
  SELECT claim_id, activity, timestamp,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp, event_id) AS rn
  FROM claim_events
),
first_A AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(rn) AS rn_A
  FROM ordered
  WHERE activity = 'A'
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
first_E AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(rn) AS rn_E
  FROM ordered
  WHERE activity = 'E'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT e.claim_id
FROM first_E e
LEFT JOIN first_A a ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE a.rn_A IS NULL OR e.rn_E < a.rn_A;

E) Closures that skip A/E/P/N (tests under-specification enabling R -> C)
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'R') = TRUE
   AND BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'C') = TRUE
   AND BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'A') = FALSE
   AND BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') = FALSE
   AND BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'P') = FALSE
   AND BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'N') = FALSE;

F) Ordering checks for intended flow R -> A -> E -> P -> N -> C
Check each pairwise precedence (X before Y). Example for A before E:
WITH first_A AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS tA
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'A'
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
first_E AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS tE
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'E'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT e.claim_id
FROM first_E e
LEFT JOIN first_A a ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE a.claim_id IS NULL OR a.tA > e.tE;
Repeat for E before P, P before N, N before C. For R before everything:
- Replace A/E/P/N/C accordingly and ensure R exists and occurs earlier.

G) Claims with multiple Rs but first event not R (tests Init(R))
WITH first_evt AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(timestamp) AS t_min
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
first_act AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.activity
  FROM claim_events ce
  JOIN first_evt fe
    ON fe.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   AND fe.t_min = ce.timestamp
  ORDER BY ce.claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, activity AS first_activity
FROM first_act
WHERE activity <> 'R';

H) Claims closed before notification or approval (violates intended P -> N -> C)
Example: N before C
WITH first_N AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS tN
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'N'
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
first_C AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS tC
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM first_C c
LEFT JOIN first_N n ON n.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE n.claim_id IS NULL OR n.tN > c.tC;

Repeat for P before N and P before C analogously.

I) Evaluate linkage to assigned adjusters (consistency between A and E)
Assuming resource in E should be an adjuster assigned in A for the same claim.
1) List E events where no prior A exists:
WITH e_events AS (
  SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS tE, resource AS eval_resource
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'E'
),
prior_A AS (
  SELECT e.claim_id, e.tE, e.eval_resource
  FROM e_events e
  LEFT JOIN claim_events a
    ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
   AND a.activity = 'A'
   AND a.timestamp <= e.tE
  GROUP BY e.claim_id, e.tE, e.eval_resource
  HAVING COUNT(a.event_id) = 0
)
SELECT * FROM prior_A;

2) E performed by resource not matching any assigned adjuster (if A stores adjuster in additional_info or resource)
-- If A.resource holds adjuster name:
WITH assignments AS (
  SELECT claim_id, resource AS assigned_resource, timestamp AS tA
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'A'
),
evaluations AS (
  SELECT claim_id, resource AS eval_resource, timestamp AS tE
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'E'
)
SELECT e.claim_id, e.eval_resource, a.assigned_resource
FROM evaluations e
LEFT JOIN assignments a
  ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
 AND a.tA = (
   SELECT MAX(tA) FROM assignments a2
   WHERE a2.claim_id = e.claim_id AND a2.tA <= e.tE
 )
WHERE a.assigned_resource IS NULL OR e.eval_resource <> a.assigned_resource;

J) Cross-check adjuster registry for E performers
-- If resources in events should match adjusters.name:
SELECT DISTINCT e.resource
FROM claim_events e
LEFT JOIN adjusters ad ON ad.name = e.resource
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND ad.adjuster_id IS NULL;

K) Volume of fast-track closures (R -> C within short window)
SELECT ce.claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS tR,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS tC
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING BOOL_OR(activity = 'R') AND BOOL_OR(activity = 'C')
   AND BOOL_OR(activity IN ('A','E','P','N')) = FALSE
   OR (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END)
       - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END)) <= INTERVAL '1 hour';

Together, these queries test the identified anomalies, quantify their occurrence, and validate whether process executions deviate from the intended flow.
