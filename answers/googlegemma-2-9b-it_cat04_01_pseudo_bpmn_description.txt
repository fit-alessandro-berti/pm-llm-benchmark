## Customer Request Processing: A Detailed Explanation

This pseudo-BPMN model represents a business process for handling customer requests for products or services. The process differentiates between standard and custom requests, introduces approval gates, and includes a mechanism for handling scenarios requiring rework.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Start Event:** The process begins when a customer submits a request.

2. **Receive Customer Request (Task A):** This task captures and records all the information contained within the customer's request.

3. **Check Request Type (Gateway XOR):** The system evaluates the type of request: **Standard** or **Custom**. This branching point dictates which subsequent tasks are executed.

4. **Standard Request Path:**
   - **Perform Standard Validation (Task B1):** This task checks if the requested product or service meets pre-defined criteria and availability.
   - **Run Parallel Checks (Gateway AND):** This gateway enforces that multiple checks are executed simultaneously:
      - **Credit Check (Task C1):** Verifies the customer's creditworthiness.
      - **Inventory Check (Task C2):** Confirms the requested items are in stock.
   - **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join):** This task ensures that all parallel checks are finished before proceeding.
   - **Calculate Delivery Date (Task D):** Based on available information, this task estimates the delivery date for the request.
  
5. **Custom Request Path:**
   - **Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis (Task B2):** This task analyzes the unique requirements of the custom request to determine its viability.
   - **Is Customization Feasible? (Gateway XOR):** The analysis results in one of two options:
      - **Yes (Task E1): Prepare Custom Quotation:** A tailored quotation is generated based on the custom specifications.
      - **No (Task E2): Send Rejection Notice:** The customer is notified that the custom request cannot be fulfilled.

6. **After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed:**
   - **Is Approval Needed? (Gateway XOR):** The system checks whether managerial approval is required based on the request type and its potential impact.
      - **Yes (Task F): Obtain Manager Approval:** A manager reviews the request and provides approval.
         - **Is Approval Granted? (Gateway XOR):** 
            - **Yes (Task G): Generate Final Invoice:** The invoice is issued, finalizing the transaction.
            - **No (Task H): Re-evaluate Conditions:** The requestor is asked to re-evaluate certain conditions, potentially looping back to Task E1 (for Custom) or Task D (for Standard).
      - **No Approval Needed (Task G): Generate Final Invoice:** The invoice is issued without requiring managerial approval.

7. **Send Confirmation to Customer (Task I):** The customer receives final confirmation regarding their request, including the agreed-upon delivery date or quotation details.

8. **End Event:** The process concludes successfully.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The process differentiates based on **request type (standard vs. custom)**, leading to divergent paths and specific tasks for each type.
* **Gateways** control the flow of the process based on conditions, ensuring tasks are executed in a logical sequence or concurrently.
* The process includes **approval gates** to manage risk and ensure appropriate decision-making.
* **Looping mechanisms** allow for rework and adjustments, enabling the process to handle scenarios requiring further iterations or modifications.
