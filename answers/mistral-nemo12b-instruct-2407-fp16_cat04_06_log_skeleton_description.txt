Based on the provided declarative constraints, I've inferred a process model for a declaration approval workflow. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

1. **Initial Declaration**
   - The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration for approval.
   - Activity Occurrences: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

2. **Administrative Review**
   - The declaration is reviewed and either approved or rejected by the administration.
   - Equivalence: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER') & ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION')
   - Activity Occurrences: `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION` (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

3. **Budget Owner Review**
   - If approved by administration, the declaration goes to the budget owner for review.
   - Equivalence: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER')
   - Activity Occurrences: `Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER` (0, 1, 2)

4. **Supervisor Review**
   - The declaration can also be sent to a supervisor for review.
   - Equivalence: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR') & ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')
   - Activity Occurrences: `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

5. **Pre-Approver Review**
   - A pre-approver can also review the declaration.
   - Equivalence: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING') & ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER')
   - Activity Occurrences: `Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER` (0, 1, 2, 3)

6. **Rejection Paths**
   - The declaration can be rejected at various stages by different roles.
   - Never Together constraints prevent certain rejections from co-existing with other activities.
   - Activity Occurrences for rejection activities range from 0 to multiple occurrences.

7. **Payment**
   - If approved, a payment request can be made.
   - Directly-Follows Constraints: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Request Payment')
   - Activity Occurrences: `Request Payment` (0, 1)

8. **Payment Handling**
   - After the payment request, the payment is handled.
   - Always After constraint: ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE')
   - Activity Occurrences: `Payment Handled` (0, 1)

9. **Saving Declaration**
   - The declaration can be saved at various stages by the employee.
   - Activity Occurrences: `Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE` (0, 1)

The process model allows for multiple reviews and rejections, with different roles involved in the approval workflow. It also includes a payment request and handling stage if the declaration is approved. The constraints ensure that certain activities occur together or never co-exist, providing structure to the process flow.
