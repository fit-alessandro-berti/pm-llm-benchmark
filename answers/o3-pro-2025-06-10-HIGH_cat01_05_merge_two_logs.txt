Field description  
primary_timestamp – chronologically ordering key (System A timestamp when present, else System B)  
timestamp_A / timestamp_B – raw timestamps kept for traceability  
origin – A, B, or A+B indicating which logs contributed to the row  
comment on merge – short explanation of the matching decision  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
How the merge decisions were made

1. Key(s) used  
   • order_id must match (all events concern Order#1234)  
   • Absolute timestamp difference  2 s  automatic match  
   • If  > 2 s but semantics unmistakably align (e.g., “Payment Processed” vs “PaymentCheck” and no competing candidate), we merged and flagged it.

2. Name normalisation  
   System A names were taken as canonical.  Mapping applied:  
   • OrderReceived   Order Received  
   • OrderValidation Order Validated  
   • PaymentCheck    Payment Processed  
   • Shipping        Item Shipped  
   • Quality Check kept as-is (not present in A).

3. Attribute fusion  
   • All attributes from both logs are retained; missing values shown as “—”.  
   • user_id / resource_id / notes exist only in System B and therefore enrich the merged record.  
   • Where both timestamps exist, both are stored; primary_timestamp chosen from System A when available (it reflects the business sequence used by downstream analytics).

4. Unmatched events  
   • “Quality Check” appears only in System B – kept standalone.  
   • “Item Delivered” appears only in System A – kept standalone.

5. Conflict handling  
   • If conflicting attribute values had appeared, both would have been preserved with suffixes _A / _B.  No such conflicts occurred here.  
   • For the single >2 s case (Payment), the row is labelled “>tol” in the comment column to signal reduced confidence.

The resulting integrated log provides a single chronological narrative of the order lifecycle with the richer attribute set of System B, ready for process-mining or auditing purposes.
