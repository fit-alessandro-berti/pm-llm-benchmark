Here is an example of how the given DECLARE model can be extended to include new constraints that mitigate potential biases. The rationale for each constraint addition is also provided.

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New constraint: If a decision for a minority applicant is made,
        # ensure a manual review coexists to mitigate bias.
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New constraint: Ensure a bias mitigation check happens after checking the applicant's race before making a decision.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        # New constraint: Ensure that sensitive attribute checks do not coexist with direct rejection.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonsuccession": {
        # New constraint: Prevent a direct succession from checking applicant's race to rejecting the application,
        # which could lead to immediate biased outcomes.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints:

- **Coexistence:**
  - Added coexistence constraints ensuring that `ManualReview` must occur if a decision is made for minority applicants (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`). This helps in mitigating any potential bias by introducing an additional review step.

- **Succession:**
  - Introduced a succession constraint from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`. It ensures that before making any decision based on the checked race, there is a mitigation step taken which reviews for any possible biases and addresses them.

- **Non-succession & Non-coexistence:**
  - Added constraints to prevent direct succession or coexistence between checking an applicant's sensitive attributes (like `ApplicantRace`) directly leading to rejection without proper checks. This avoids immediate biased outcomes based on sensitive information.

These modifications ensure a more transparent, consistent, and fair process by ensuring that decisions are not made solely based on sensitive attributes but rather go through additional unbiased review steps.
