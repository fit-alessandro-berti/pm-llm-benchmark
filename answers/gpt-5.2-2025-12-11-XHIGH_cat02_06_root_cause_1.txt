### 1) Cases with significantly longer total resolution times (Receive  Close)

| Case | Total cycle time | Compared to “fast” cases (101/103) | Outlier? |
|---|---:|---|---|
| 103 | **1h 20m** | Baseline fast | No |
| 101 | **2h 15m** | Baseline fast | No |
| 104 | **24h 10m** | ~10–18× longer | **Yes** |
| 102 | **25h 10m** | ~11–19× longer | **Yes** |
| 105 | **49h 05m** | ~22–37× longer | **Yes (worst)** |

Outliers: **102, 104, 105**.

### 2) Likely root causes (from patterns in the timestamps)

#### A. Escalation-driven queueing / handoff delays (Level2 wait)
Escalated cases show very large idle gaps after escalation:

- **Case 105:** *Escalate  Investigate* = **28h**
- **Case 102:** *Escalate  Investigate* = **2h 30m**

This strongly suggests a **Level2 capacity/queue bottleneck** (or slow handoff/assignment after escalation).

#### B. “Overnight” waiting between investigation and resolution
All long cases have a very similar delay where work stops until the next morning:

- **Case 102:** *Investigate (Day 1 14:00)  Resolve (Day 2 09:00)* = **19h**
- **Case 104:** *Investigate (Day 1 13:00)  Resolve (Day 2 08:00)* = **19h**
- **Case 105:** *Investigate (Day 2 14:00)  Resolve (Day 3 09:00)* = **19h**

This points to **end-of-day cutoffs** (limited hours, shift handovers, SLA batching, or waiting on external dependencies not captured as explicit events).

#### C. Delayed start of investigation (pre-work queue at Level1)
Even without escalation, there are big waits before investigation begins:

- **Case 104:** *Assign  Investigate* = **3h 30m** (largest among non-escalated)
- Fast cases:  
  - **Case 103:** *Assign  Investigate* = **15m**  
  - **Case 101:** *Assign  Investigate* = **40m**

This suggests **Level1 workload/queueing** or inefficient routing/priority.

#### D. Late escalation decision (possible mis-triage)
- **Case 102:** *Assign L1  Escalate* = **2h 30m** (L1 spends a long time before escalating)
- **Case 105:** L1 investigates, then escalates after **50m**

This can indicate **tickets that should have been routed to Level2 earlier**, increasing rework/elapsed time.

### 3) How these factors increase cycle time + recommendations

#### How they drive longer cycle times
- The dominant driver in long cases is **waiting time**, not “work time.”
  - Example: **Case 105** is ~49h total, but **~47h** of it is just two waits (**28h after escalation** + **19h overnight**).
- **Escalations introduce extra queues and handoffs**, amplifying delays if Level2 isn’t staffed/managed to meet demand.
- **Work pauses overnight** create near-fixed ~19h blocks, turning “same-day” issues into “next-day” closures.

#### Practical recommendations
1. **Set and enforce handoff SLAs**
   - e.g., “Escalated tickets must be picked up by Level2 within X hours.”
   - Monitor *Escalate  Investigate* as a primary KPI.

2. **Increase Level2 responsiveness (capacity or routing)**
   - Add Level2 staffing during peak escalation windows, or implement an on-call rotation for urgent escalations.
   - Introduce a “rapid triage” Level2 intake to reduce the 28h-type delays.

3. **Improve triage to reduce late/avoidable escalations**
   - Add clearer escalation criteria, better classification, or automated suggestions so misrouted tickets go to Level2 immediately.
   - Measure *Assign L1  Escalate* time; long values are a signal of “wrong queue first.”

4. **Reduce end-of-day carryover**
   - If feasible: extend coverage or create a “finish-what-you-start” policy so investigations begun late day are either resolved or explicitly handed over.
   - If not feasible: add an explicit status like “Waiting for customer/vendor” to distinguish true external waits from internal inactivity.

5. **Focus on the biggest bottleneck metrics**
   - Prioritize improvements that shrink:
     - *Escalate  Investigate* (Level2 queue)
     - *Investigate  Resolve* when it crosses business-day boundaries (handover/after-hours)

If you want, I can compute “idle-time share” per case and rank the exact segments contributing most to cycle time (a mini bottleneck breakdown).
