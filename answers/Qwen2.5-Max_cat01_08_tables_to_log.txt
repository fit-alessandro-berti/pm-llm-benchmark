### Assumptions and Notes:
1. **Case ID**: The `order_id` is used as the unique identifier for each process instance.
2. **Activity Names**: Activities are derived from key steps in the order lifecycle (e.g., "Order Created," "Items Picked," etc.).
3. **Timestamps**: Each event is timestamped using the relevant date/time field from the source table.
4. **Resources/Actors**: Where available, the resource responsible for the activity is included (e.g., salesperson, picker, carrier, billing clerk).
5. **Other Attributes**: Additional attributes such as `customer_id`, `item_id`, `quantity`, `invoice_amount`, and `payment_method` are included to enrich the event log.
6. **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered by their timestamps to reflect the real process flow.

This event log can now be used for process mining to analyze and optimize the business process.
