 ### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The average time of approximately 25 hours with a very low standard deviation between receiving a claim and approving it suggests an unusually strict and uniform process that may not account for the complexity of claims assessment.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):** The long delay of 7 days on average between claim approval and customer notification, with a high standard deviation, indicates inconsistent treatment of claims post-approval. This could be due to systemic issues or bottlenecks in the notification process.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):** The average of 2 hours to close a claim after it has been assigned is unexpectedly brief, given that typical process flow includes evaluation and approval steps, which are not reflected in this duration.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** The very short average time of 5 minutes between claim evaluation and customer notification raises questions about the thoroughness of the evaluation process or the possibility of automated, rather than manual, notifications.

### Hypotheses on the Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The uniformity in approval times could be due to an automated system that approves claims based on predefined criteria without sufficient human oversight. Alternatively, there may be a policy to process claims within a certain timeframe regardless of complexity.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):** The delay in notifying customers could be due to administrative backlogs, resource constraints within the notification team, or possibly a manual process that is sensitive to working hours and holidays.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):** The immediate closure of some claims might indicate that certain claims are being erroneously closed without a proper evaluation or approval process, possibly due to human error or system glitches.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** The rapid transition from evaluation to notification suggests that the evaluation might be automated for certain types of claims, or that there is a protocol to quickly notify customers when specific conditions are met.

### Verification SQL Queries

1. **Investigating R to P (Receive to Approve):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_type, ce.timestamp AS receive_time, ce2.timestamp AS approve_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) < (3600 * 24 + 3600) - (600 * 2) -- Less than 1 day, 1 hour minus 2 STDEVs
ORDER BY (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) DESC;
```

2. **Analyzing P to N (Approve to Notify):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_type, ce.timestamp AS approve_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'P'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) > (604800 + (172800 * 2)) -- More than 7 days plus 2 STDEVs
ORDER BY (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) DESC;
```

3. **Examining A to C (Assign to Close):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_type, ce.timestamp AS assign_time, ce2.timestamp AS close_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) < (7200 + (3600 * 2)) -- Less than 2 hours plus 2 STDEVs
ORDER BY (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) ASC;
```

4. **Probing E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_type, ce.timestamp AS eval_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) < (300 - (60 * 2)) -- Less than 5 minutes minus 2 STDEVs
ORDER BY (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) ASC;
```

5. **Correlation with Adjusters, Claim Types, and Resources:**
```sql
SELECT a.adjuster_id, a.name, a.specialization, c.claim_type, COUNT(*), AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM age(ce2.timestamp, ce.timestamp)))
FROM adjusters a
JOIN claim_events ce ON a.adjuster_id = ce.resource AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name, a.specialization, c.claim_type
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM age(ce2.timestamp, ce.timestamp))) < 7200; -- Less than 2 hours average
```

These queries aim to identify unusual patterns in the claims handling process, potentially shedding light on process inefficiencies or errors that need to be addressed.
