### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Existence Constraints:**
   - Added `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` as mandatory activities to ensure that every trace involves a fairness check and manual review when sensitive attributes are involved.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - Added constraints requiring that sensitive attribute-based decision activities (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`) must always coexist with `ManualReview`. This ensures that such decisions are consistently audited to mitigate bias.

3. **Response Constraints:**
   - Added relationships requiring `BiasMitigationCheck` after `CheckApplicantRace`. This ensures that any activity disclosing a sensitive attribute triggers a fairness check.
   - Added a response ensuring that `BiasMitigationCheck` must be followed by `FinalDecision`, building an explicit sequence of unbiased checks.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - Enforced that `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` must precede `FinalDecision` to guarantee they are always performed before a decision is finalized.

5. **ChainResponse and Chainsuccession Constraints:**
   - Enforced immediate transitions (`chainresponse` and `chainsuccession`) from sensitive attribute disclosure (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to `BiasMitigationCheck` and subsequently to `ManualReview`. This ensures a structured, bias-aware process workflow without interruptions.

6. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - Prevented direct succession from sensitive attribute-disclosing events (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantAge`) to decision-making events (`FinalDecision`). This blocks biased "snap decisions" without checks.

### Rationale for Bias Mitigation:
- **Fairness Assurance:** By mandating coexistence and sequencing constraints, we ensure that decisions involving sensitive attributes (e.g., race, age) are subject to additional reviews and bias-mitigation steps.
- **Avoid Discrimination:** Non-succession constraints prevent situations where sensitive information immediately influences decisions, reducing the risk of unconscious bias.
- **Consistency:** Requiring `ManualReview` and structured checks ensures that applicants in sensitive demographics are treated equitably throughout the process.
