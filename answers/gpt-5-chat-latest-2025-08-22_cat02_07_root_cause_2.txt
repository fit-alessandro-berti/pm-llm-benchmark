Great, let’s work through this step by step.

### **Step 1: Identify Cases with Long Durations**
We calculate the total **lead time** (from *Submit Claim* to *Close Claim*) for each case:

- **Case 2001 (Low, Region A):**  
  2024-04-01 09:00  2024-04-01 10:30 = **1.5 hours**  

- **Case 2002 (Medium, Region B):**  
  2024-04-01 09:05  2024-04-02 11:00 = **~26 hours**  

- **Case 2003 (High, Region A):**  
  2024-04-01 09:10  2024-04-03 09:30 = **~48 hours (2 days)**  

- **Case 2004 (Low, Region B):**  
  2024-04-01 09:20  2024-04-01 10:45 = **1.5 hours**  

- **Case 2005 (High, Region B):**  
  2024-04-01 09:25  2024-04-04 14:30 = **~3.2 days (75 hours)**  

 So, the **problematic long-duration cases** are: **2002, 2003, 2005**.  
(short duration cases = 2001, 2004).

### **Step 2: Attribute Analysis**

####  By Complexity:
- **Low Complexity (2001 + 2004):** both completed in ~1.5 hours; very fast, no major delays.  
- **Medium Complexity (2002):** took more than a day (due to additional documents request).  
- **High Complexity (2003, 2005):** took **2–3 days**, both had **multiple "Request Additional Documents" steps**.  

 High complexity **correlates with longer lead times**, especially due to repeated document requests.  

---

####  By Region:
- **Region A (2001, 2003):**  
  - Low complexity case (2001) = very fast.  
  - High complexity case (2003) = 48 hours, one extra document loop.  
   Region A seems **efficient for simple claims** but still struggles with high complexity.  

- **Region B (2002, 2004, 2005):**  
  - Low complexity (2004) = fast.  
  - Medium (2002) = 1+ day.  
  - High (2005) = 3+ days (multiple repeat loops).  
   Region B shows a **performance drop-off once complexity increases**, especially with multiple documentation requests.  

 Region B looks **slower than Region A** at higher complexities.  

---

####  By Resources:
- **Adjuster_Mike (Region A):** handled low and high cases. For High complexity (2003), requested documents twice, case extended to 2 days.  
- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B):** handled medium and high complexity. Both had **delays**, especially case 2005 with **3 additional document requests**, leading to 3+ days processing.  
- **Managers:** Manager_Ann (faster approvals) vs. Manager_Bill (appears only in high complexity cases, approvals happen *later*  may reflect workload backlog).  
- **Finance:** Both Alan (A) and Carl (B) process quickly (so Finance not a bottleneck).  
- **CSR intake staff:** No clear impact on performance.  

 **Adjuster_Lisa + Region B + High complexity** = biggest bottleneck.  
 **Manager_Bill** approvals appear slower, perhaps contributing to delays in escalation.  

---

### **Step 3: Root Cause Explanations**

1. **Complexity Drives Delays**  
   - High complexity claims (2003, 2005) require more back-and-forth with customers.  
   - Each "Request Additional Documents" cycle adds waiting time.  

2. **Regional Effect (Region B Slower for Complex Cases)**  
   - Region B adjuster (Lisa) triggered 3 document requests in case 2005, vs. Region A adjuster (Mike) who only requested twice for a similar high case.  
   - Suggests Region B may **lack clear guidelines or suffer from miscommunication** in gathering all required documentation at once.  

3. **Resource-Specific Effect**  
   - **Adjuster_Lisa consistently escalates complexity into longer durations compared to Adjuster_Mike.**  
   - **Manager_Bill’s approvals** come later than Manager_Ann’s, indicating possible bottlenecks when Bill is responsible.  

---

### **Step 4: Suggestions to Mitigate Issues**

 **For High Complexity Claims:**  
- Standardize & streamline document requirements so that all requests are made in **one consolidated batch** rather than multiple delays.  
- Train adjusters (particularly in Region B) on procedures for handling high complexity efficiently.

 **For Regional Disparity (Region B):**  
- Review Region B’s claims handling policies. Investigate whether high workloads, unclear guidelines, or lack of training cause repeated document requests.  
- Balance workload between A & B regions if feasible.  

 **For Resource Management:**  
- Support Adjuster_Lisa with either better checklists, mentoring, or automated validation of required documents before requests are sent.  
- Assess why Manager_Bill’s approvals take longer: workload distribution, or slower decision-making process.  

 **General Process Improvement:**  
- Introduce **automation/digital portals** for document submission, ensuring customers provide required information immediately.  
- Use predictive analytics to **flag high-complexity claims early** and allocate more experienced adjusters.  

---

### ** Summary**
- **Cases with long durations:** 2002 (medium, Region B), 2003 (high, Region A), 2005 (high, Region B).  
- **Root causes:** High complexity cases with repeated document requests; inefficiencies stronger in **Region B**; **Adjuster_Lisa** and **Manager_Bill** correlate with longer delays.  
- **Improvements:** Streamlined document collection, targeted training for Region B, workload balancing, and stronger guidance for Adjuster_Lisa and Manager_Bill.

Would you like me to **visualize these insights** (e.g., timelines per case or heatmap of region vs complexity vs lead time) so it’s clearer where the delays cluster?
