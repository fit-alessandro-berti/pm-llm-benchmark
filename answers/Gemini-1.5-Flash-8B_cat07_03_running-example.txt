The visualization is a flowchart, likely representing a process for handling a request.  Let's break down the steps:

1. **Start:** The process begins.

2. **Register request:**  A request is initiated.

3. **Examine thoroughly / Examine casually:**  The request is examined in two ways: one thorough, and the other casual.  These could represent different levels of scrutiny or different types of requests.

4. **Check ticket:** A crucial step, likely verifying the request against some kind of record (like a ticket).

5. **Decide:**  A decision point.  This diamond shape indicates a conditional.  Based on the outcome of the preceding steps, the process moves down one path or another.

6. **Reject request / Pay compensation / Reinitiate request:**  These are the possible outcomes based on the decision.
   * If the decision is negative (indicated by the "X"), the request may be rejected or compensation may be required (if applicable).
   * If the decision is positive (indicated by the "+"), the request might be re-evaluated for the process to continue in other steps (reinitiate).

7. **End:**  The process concludes.

**In Summary:** The flowchart depicts a workflow where a request is registered, examined, and checked. A decision is made based on the examination, and depending on the outcome, the request might be rejected, require compensation, or require further action (reinitiation).  This is a common structure for handling requests and resolving issues, where a casual examination could suffice or a more thorough review and decision-making is needed.
