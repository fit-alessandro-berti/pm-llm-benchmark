The bias appears in the **Group B (Unprotected Group)** log, specifically in how the **`CommunityGroup`** and **`ScoreAdjustment`** fields are used.

### 1. How the process differs between groups

- **Group A (Protected)**
  - `LocalResident` is always `FALSE`.
  - `CommunityGroup` is always `None`.
  - `ScoreAdjustment` is always `0`.
  - Final decisions are based solely on the **PreliminaryScore** (720 approved, 710 rejected, 740 approved).

- **Group B (Unprotected)**
  - `LocalResident` is always `TRUE`.
  - Some applicants belong to **“Highland Civic Darts Club”** in the `CommunityGroup` field.
  - When `CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club`, the `ScoreAdjustment` is **+10 (Community Boost)** at the Preliminary and ManualReview stages, and this adjusted score is carried into the FinalDecision.
  - Applicants without a community group get `ScoreAdjustment = 0`.

### 2. How the bias manifests

Look at similar underlying scores across both groups:

- **Score = 720**
  - Group A, P001: 720  no adjustment  **Approved**.
  - Group B, U001: 720  +10 (Community Boost)  730  **Approved**.
  - Outcome is the same, but U001 is *favored* relative to P001 by an extra 10 points due to community membership.

- **Score = 710**
  - Group A, P002: 710  0 adjustment  **Rejected**.
  - Group B, U002: 710  0 adjustment  **Rejected**.
  - No community membership  no boost  both rejected.

- **Lower underlying score can still be approved in Group B**
  - Group A has no example < 710 being approved.
  - Group B, U003:
    - Underlying PreliminaryScore: 695
    - +10 Community Boost  705
    - Final decision: **Approved**.
  - So a **695**-score applicant in Group B is approved because of community-based boosting, while a 710-score applicant without a boost (P002 and U002) is rejected.

This means membership in a specific community group systematically improves outcomes, even for weaker underlying scores.

### 3. Role of `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup`

- **LocalResident**
  - Group A: always FALSE.
  - Group B: always TRUE.
  - In this small sample, `LocalResident` correlates perfectly with being in Group B (the unprotected group). Even if the rules do not explicitly use `LocalResident`, it acts as a marker that is strongly associated with who can receive the community boost.

- **CommunityGroup**
  - Only present (and beneficial) for some Group B cases.
  - Belonging to “Highland Civic Darts Club” triggers the **+10 “Community Boost”**.
  - Group A applicants never receive any community boost; the feature is effectively **unavailable** to them.

Because `CommunityGroup` is used as a positive adjustment and is only observed in Group B, the system confers systematic advantage to Group B applicants who are in that club. If, in the real world, membership in this club is correlated with the unprotected class (e.g., certain demographic), then this adjustment introduces **indirect (proxy) discrimination**.

### 4. Why this is bias

- The logs show **structural asymmetry**:
  - Only Group B applicants can benefit from a **+10 boost** linked to `CommunityGroup`.
  - Protected Group A applicants have **no mechanism** to receive comparable positive adjustments, even if they had similar or higher underlying scores.
- This systematically:
  - Raises the effective scores of some unprotected-group applicants above decision thresholds.
  - Leaves protected-group applicants at a disadvantage for the same or even better preliminary scores.

**Conclusion:**  
The process reflected in **Group B’s log is biased** because the scoring and final decisions incorporate a **community-based score adjustment** that is only applied to (and available for) the unprotected group. Through the combined use of `LocalResident`, `CommunityGroup`, and `ScoreAdjustment`, the system creates systematic differences in final decisions that favor members of the unprotected group.
