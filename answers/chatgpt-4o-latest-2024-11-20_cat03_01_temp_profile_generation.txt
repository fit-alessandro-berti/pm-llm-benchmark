Certainly! Below is a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. For simplicity, I've included key activities that are often part of such a process, and assumed rough timings for illustrative purposes. The format adheres to your requirement `(activity_pair: (average_time, standard_deviation))`:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Time between requisition and approval of requisition
    ('Create Requisition', 'Approve Requisition'): (86400, 7200),  # 1 day avg, 2 hours stdev
    
    # Time between approval of requisition and creation of purchase order
    ('Approve Requisition', 'Create Purchase Order'): (172800, 14400),  # 2 days avg, 4 hours stdev
    
    # Time between creation of purchase order and sending the PO to the vendor
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send PO to Vendor'): (43200, 10800),  # 12 hours avg, 3 hours stdev
    
    # Time between sending PO to vendor and receiving the goods
    ('Send PO to Vendor', 'Receive Goods'): (604800, 86400),  # 7 days avg, 1 day stdev
    
    # Time between receiving goods and recording goods receipt
    ('Receive Goods', 'Record Goods Receipt'): (21600, 3600),  # 6 hours avg, 1 hour stdev
    
    # Time between recording goods receipt and invoice received
    ('Record Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Received'): (43200, 5400),  # 12 hours avg, 1.5 hours stdev
    
    # Time between invoice received and payment execution
    ('Invoice Received', 'Execute Payment'): (1209600, 21600),  # 14 days avg, 6 hours stdev
    
    # Example of eventual (not directly connected) timing
    # Time between creation of purchase order and goods receipt
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): (777600, 129600),  # 9 days avg, 1.5 days stdev
    
    # Time between requisition creation and payment execution
    ('Create Requisition', 'Execute Payment'): (2678400, 172800)  # 31 days avg, 2 days stdev
}
```

### Explanation of Time Intervals:
1. `Create Requisition -> Approve Requisition`: Approval typically takes about a day.
2. `Approve Requisition -> Create Purchase Order`: Purchase orders are generally created within 2 days of requisition approval.
3. `Create Purchase Order -> Send PO to Vendor`: Sending the purchase order might involve a review or system lag, averaging 12 hours.
4. `Send PO to Vendor -> Receive Goods`: Delivery times can vary depending on the vendor, but assume a week on average.
5. `Receive Goods -> Record Goods Receipt`: Recording the goods received is often a quick task and may be done the same day, within 6 hours.
6. `Record Goods Receipt -> Invoice Received`: The vendor sends an invoice shortly after confirming the goods were received.
7. `Invoice Received -> Execute Payment`: Payments are usually processed after internal checks and approval, within two weeks of receiving the invoice.

### Eventual (Not Direct) Timing:
- `Create Purchase Order -> Receive Goods`: Combines the intermediate steps (sending PO and delivery), averaging about 9 days.
- `Create Requisition -> Execute Payment`: Reflects the entire process duration, averaging around 31 days for the full cycle.

This is, of course, just a hypothetical model and can be adjusted based on actual process behavior observed in logs or through process mining.
