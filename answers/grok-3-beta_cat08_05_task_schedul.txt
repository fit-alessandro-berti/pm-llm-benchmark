### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

**Objective:** Use process mining on MES event logs to reconstruct and analyze the actual flow of jobs, task execution sequences, and performance metrics across the shop floor.

**Process Mining Approach:**
- **Event Log Preparation and Process Discovery:** Extract and preprocess the MES event logs to create a structured dataset with timestamps, case IDs (jobs), activities (tasks like Cutting, Milling), resources (machines), and other attributes (durations, priorities, disruptions). Use process discovery algorithms (e.g., Alpha Miner, Heuristics Miner, or Inductive Miner) to reconstruct the process model, visualizing the actual job routings and task sequences across machines.
- **Conformance Checking:** Compare the discovered process model against expected or normative routings to identify deviations (e.g., skipped tasks or unplanned rework loops).
- **Performance Analysis:** Apply performance mining techniques to annotate the process model with timing and resource usage data, focusing on bottlenecks, delays, and inefficiencies.

**Specific Techniques and Metrics:**
- **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:** Calculate the time from "Job Released" to the last task completion for each job (flow time) using timestamp differences in the log. Aggregate these to analyze lead time distributions (e.g., mean, median, variance) and makespan (total time to complete a batch of jobs). Use histograms or box plots to visualize variability.
- **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):** Measure the duration between "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events for each task at each machine. Aggregate by work center to identify machines with excessive queue times, indicating bottlenecks or poor scheduling.
- **Resource Utilization:** Compute the proportion of time each machine spends in "Task Start" to "Task End" (productive time), "Setup Start" to "Setup End" (setup time), and periods with no associated tasks (idle time). Similarly, analyze operator utilization by linking tasks to Operator IDs.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** Identify consecutive jobs on the same machine by sorting events by machine ID and timestamp. Extract "Setup Start" to "Setup End" durations and correlate them with attributes of the previous job (e.g., material type or job family noted in "Notes" or other fields). Use statistical analysis (e.g., regression or clustering) to model setup time as a function of job sequence characteristics.
- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:** Compare the last task completion timestamp for each job against its "Order Due Date" to compute tardiness (if completion > due date) or earliness. Quantify the frequency and magnitude of delays (e.g., percentage of late jobs, average tardiness in hours).
- **Impact of Disruptions:** Filter events related to "Breakdown Start" and "Priority Change" to analyze their downstream effects. Use time-window analysis to measure increased queue times, delayed job completions, or WIP buildup post-disruption. Correlate disruption frequency with tardiness or lead time spikes.

**Tools:** Use process mining platforms like Disco, ProM, or Celonis for visualization and analysis, supplemented by Python/R for custom statistical modeling of setup times and disruptions.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

**Objective:** Identify inefficiencies in the current scheduling approach using process mining insights.

**Key Pathologies and Evidence via Process Mining:**
- **Bottleneck Resources:** Use bottleneck analysis in process mining tools to highlight machines with the highest average queue times or lowest throughput (e.g., longest cumulative waiting times before task start). Quantify their impact by correlating bottleneck machine delays with overall job lead times.
- **Poor Task Prioritization:** Perform variant analysis to compare process paths of on-time vs. late jobs. Identify cases where high-priority or near-due-date jobs were delayed due to processing of lower-priority jobs (visible in event sequences where "Order Priority" is ignored in task start order).
- **Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Times:** Analyze setup durations on machines with sequence-dependent setups. Use frequency analysis to detect frequent job transitions with high setup times, indicating missed opportunities for batching similar jobs. Quantify total setup time as a percentage of machine time to assess impact.
- **Starvation of Downstream Resources:** Use resource contention analysis to detect periods where downstream machines (e.g., Grinding after Milling) are idle while upstream machines have long queues or delays, indicating poor coordination.
- **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:** Track WIP by counting active jobs (between "Job Released" and last task completion) over time windows. Use time-series analysis to detect WIP fluctuations correlated with scheduling variability or disruptions.

**Process Mining Techniques:** Leverage bottleneck detection (e.g., waiting time heatmaps in Disco), variant analysis (comparing process paths of late vs. on-time jobs), and resource contention analysis (visualizing machine load imbalances over time).

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

**Objective:** Investigate underlying reasons for identified pathologies using process mining insights.

**Potential Root Causes:**
- **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:** Current rules (e.g., FCFS, EDD) fail to adapt to dynamic shop floor conditions like machine availability or urgent jobs, as seen in variant analysis showing inconsistent prioritization.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Event logs reveal delays in task starts despite idle downstream machines, suggesting schedulers lack a holistic view of shop status (e.g., queue lengths, job progress).
- **Inaccurate Duration/Setup Estimates:** Discrepancies between "Task Duration (Planned)" and "Task Duration (Actual)" in logs indicate unreliable planning data, contributing to poor scheduling decisions.
- **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** High setup times for certain job sequences (from setup analysis) suggest scheduling ignores historical patterns or job similarities.
- **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:** Starvation and WIP buildup (from resource contention analysis) indicate lack of synchronization between upstream and downstream operations.
- **Inadequate Disruption Handling:** Logs show increased tardiness post-breakdowns or priority changes, revealing no robust contingency or re-scheduling mechanisms.

**Differentiating Issues via Process Mining:** Compare performance metrics (e.g., tardiness, WIP) across periods with similar workloads but different disruption frequencies to isolate scheduling logic issues from capacity constraints. Use statistical tests to determine if delays are driven by inherent process variability (e.g., task duration variance) or poor decision-making (e.g., ignoring priority in task sequencing).

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

**Objective:** Propose three sophisticated scheduling strategies informed by process mining insights to address identified issues.

**Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**
- **Core Logic:** Replace static rules with dynamic dispatching that prioritizes jobs based on a weighted score combining multiple factors: (1) due date slack (time to due date minus remaining processing time), (2) order priority, (3) estimated sequence-dependent setup time (minimize setups by favoring similar next jobs), and (4) downstream machine load (avoid upstream scheduling that causes downstream starvation).
- **Process Mining Insights:** Use historical data to weight factors (e.g., high tardiness correlation with due date slack justifies higher weight). Setup time models (from sequence analysis) inform sequencing decisions. Queue time analysis identifies downstream bottlenecks to consider in load balancing.
- **Targeted Pathologies:** Reduces tardiness (via slack/priority focus), minimizes setup waste, and prevents downstream starvation.
- **Expected Impact:** 20-30% reduction in tardiness, 10-15% decrease in total setup time, improved resource utilization by balancing loads.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Proactive Adjustments**
- **Core Logic:** Build schedules using historical task duration distributions (e.g., mean and variance per task type, operator, or job complexity) and predictive maintenance models (if breakdown patterns are mined from logs). Use machine learning to predict potential delays or bottlenecks and adjust schedules proactively (e.g., reassign jobs to alternate machines if a bottleneck is predicted).
- **Process Mining Insights:** Extract task duration distributions and breakdown frequencies from logs to parameterize predictive models. Bottleneck analysis highlights critical machines for proactive monitoring.
- **Targeted Pathologies:** Addresses unpredictable lead times (via accurate duration estimates) and disruption impacts (via predictive re-scheduling).
- **Expected Impact:** 15-25% improvement in lead time predictability, 10-20% reduction in disruption-induced delays.

**Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Intelligent Sequencing**
- **Core Logic:** Minimize sequence-dependent setup times by clustering jobs with similar setup requirements (e.g., same material or tool needs) for consecutive processing on bottleneck machines. Use a heuristic or optimization algorithm (e.g., genetic algorithm) to sequence jobs, informed by historical setup time patterns.
- **Process Mining Insights:** Setup time analysis provides a matrix of setup durations for job type transitions, used to define similarity clusters and optimize sequences.
- **Targeted Pathologies:** Reduces total setup time waste, especially at bottlenecks, indirectly lowering WIP and lead times.
- **Expected Impact:** 15-20% reduction in setup time, 10-15% decrease in WIP at bottleneck stations, improved throughput.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Simulation and Evaluation:**
- **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES):** Build a DES model of the shop floor using tools like AnyLogic or Arena, parameterized with process mining data (e.g., task duration distributions, routing probabilities, setup time matrices, breakdown frequencies). Replicate historical job arrivals, machine capacities, and operator availability.
- **Testing Scenarios:** Evaluate strategies under (1) high load (peak order volumes), (2) frequent disruptions (increased breakdowns/urgent jobs), and (3) mixed priority orders (varying due dates and priorities). Compare KPIs (tardiness, WIP, lead time, utilization) against the baseline (current rules) and across strategies.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Focus on percentage improvements in tardiness frequency, average lead time, WIP levels, and machine utilization rates. Use statistical significance tests to validate results.

**Continuous Improvement Framework:**
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Deploy real-time process mining on streaming MES data to track KPIs (e.g., tardiness, WIP) via dashboards. Use automated alerts for KPI deviations (e.g., tardiness > threshold) or emerging bottlenecks (queue time spikes).
- **Drift Detection:** Apply conformance checking periodically to detect process drifts (e.g., new job types altering routings) or scheduling inefficiencies (e.g., increased setup times due to poor sequencing). Use statistical process control to monitor variability in lead times or utilization.
- **Adaptation:** Adjust scheduling parameters (e.g., dispatching rule weights, setup clustering criteria) based on detected drifts. Retrain predictive models with new data to maintain accuracy in duration or breakdown predictions.
- **Feedback Loop:** Implement a quarterly review cycle to analyze process mining insights, simulate strategy tweaks, and deploy updates, ensuring scheduling logic evolves with shop floor dynamics.
