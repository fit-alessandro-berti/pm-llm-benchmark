**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

1. **Coexistence Constraints (`coexistence` for `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority` with `ManualReview`):**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure fairness in decision-making for sensitive applicant groups by mandating a `ManualReview` for all decisions affecting them.
   - **Effect:** Enhances transparency and human oversight, reducing the risk of automated bias.

2. **Response Constraint (`response` from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`):**
   - **Purpose:** Interrupt the process after sensitive attribute checks to perform a `BiasMitigationCheck`, ensuring that decisions are not immediately influenced by these attributes.
   - **Effect:** Provides an additional layer of scrutiny to mitigate potential biases based on sensitive information.

3. **Succession Constraints (`succession` from `BiasMitigationCheck` to `Approve` or `Reject`):**
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that all decisions (both approvals and rejections) are preceded by a `BiasMitigationCheck`, further guaranteeing fairness.
   - **Effect:** Systematically enforces a fair decision-making process by making mitigation checks a prerequisite for all final decisions.

4. **Non-succession Constraint (`nonsuccession` from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject`):**
   - **Purpose:** Specifically prevent the immediate rejection of applicants after their race has been checked, avoiding a clear pathway for biased decisions.
   - **Effect:** Removes a direct sequence that could facilitate discriminatory practices, promoting a more equitable process.
