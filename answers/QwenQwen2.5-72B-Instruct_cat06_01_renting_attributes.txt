In the context of fairness in process mining, sensitive attributes are those that can lead to discrimination or unfair treatment if used improperly. These attributes typically include personal characteristics that are protected by law or ethical guidelines, such as gender, race, age, and marital status. In your provided event log, the following attributes can be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **`case:citizen`**:
   - **Values**: False (44,989), True (44,983)
   - **Sensitivity**: This attribute indicates whether the tenant is a citizen or not. Using this attribute to make decisions can lead to discrimination based on citizenship status.

2. **`case:gender`**:
   - **Values**: True (55,329), False (34,643)
   - **Sensitivity**: This attribute indicates the gender of the tenant. Using gender to make decisions can lead to gender-based discrimination.

3. **`case:german speaking`**:
   - **Values**: False (45,322), True (44,650)
   - **Sensitivity**: This attribute indicates whether the tenant speaks German. Using language proficiency to make decisions can lead to discrimination based on language or national origin.

4. **`case:married`**:
   - **Values**: True (45,078), False (44,894)
   - **Sensitivity**: This attribute indicates the marital status of the tenant. Using marital status to make decisions can lead to discrimination based on family status.

These attributes should be handled with care to ensure that they do not lead to unfair treatment of individuals. When analyzing and optimizing the process, it is important to consider the impact of these attributes on decision-making and to ensure that the process is fair and unbiased. For example, if you notice that certain activities or decisions are more frequently associated with specific values of these sensitive attributes, it might indicate a potential bias that needs to be addressed.

### Example of Potential Bias to Look For:
- **Citizenship**:
  - If the activity "Reject Prospective Tenant" is more frequently associated with non-citizens, this could indicate a bias.
- **Gender**:
  - If the activity "Evict Tenant" is disproportionately associated with a particular gender, this could indicate a gender bias.
- **Language**:
  - If the activity "Accept Late Payment" is less frequently associated with tenants who do not speak German, this could indicate a language-based bias.
- **Marital Status**:
  - If the activity "Sign Contract" is more frequently associated with married individuals, this could indicate a bias based on marital status.

By carefully analyzing the data and ensuring that these sensitive attributes do not influence decisions in a discriminatory manner, you can promote fairness and equity in the process.
