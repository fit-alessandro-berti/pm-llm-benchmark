# Normative Process Violation Analysis

## Reference: Expected Sequences

| Scenario | Expected Sequence |
|---|---|
| Sufficient inventory | Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order |
| Insufficient inventory | Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order |

## Case-by-Case Assessment

###  Case 1 — No Violations
**Sequence:** Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This matches the sufficient-inventory path exactly. Every activity occurs in the prescribed order, and all required steps are present.

---

###  Case 2 — Violation Identified
**Sequence:** Receive  Check inventory  **Package items  Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order

**Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."**

The normative description explicitly states that *"Package items should only occur after authorization,"* because items must not be prepared for shipment until the customer's payment is confirmed valid. In this case, packaging precedes payment authorization, inverting a required dependency. Even though both activities are ultimately present before shipping, the ordering itself constitutes a process violation.

###  Case 3 — Multiple Violations Identified
**Sequence:** Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violation 1: "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."**

The normative description is unambiguous: *"Ship order should never occur after a cancellation."* Once an order is canceled, all fulfillment activities (packaging, shipping) are illogical and prohibited. Shipping a canceled order is a direct and serious breach of the process.

**Violation 2: "Authorize payment" occurs in a cancellation path.**

The description specifies that if inventory is insufficient, the process should go directly from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order." The presence of "Authorize payment" before the cancellation is inconsistent — payment authorization only makes sense when inventory is confirmed sufficient and the order will proceed to fulfillment. Authorizing a payment for an order that is subsequently canceled represents a misapplication of that activity, violating the intent of the branching logic.

###  Case 4 — No Violations
**Sequence:** Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This matches the insufficient-inventory path exactly. The order is checked, canceled, and closed with no improper fulfillment activities inserted.

---

###  Case 5 — Violation Identified
**Sequence:** Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  ~~Package items~~  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violation: "Ship order" occurs without a preceding "Package items" step.**

The normative description states that *"Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping,"* and that *"Ship order should only occur after packaging."* The "Package items" activity is entirely absent from this case. Skipping the packaging step and proceeding directly to shipping violates the mandatory sequencing — items cannot be properly shipped if they have never been prepared and packaged.
