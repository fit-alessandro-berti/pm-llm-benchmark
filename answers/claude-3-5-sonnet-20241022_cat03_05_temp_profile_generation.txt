I'll create a temporal profile dictionary for the global supply chain process, considering realistic time delays between activities and their variations. I'll include both directly connected activities and those separated by multiple steps.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct sequential activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 3600),         # Supplier selection to order placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400),      # Order placement to receiving components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 3600),        # Receiving to quality inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (28800, 7200),        # Quality inspection to assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (43200, 14400),       # Assembly to product testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (10800, 3600),        # Testing to packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 1800),         # Packaging to warehouse storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),       # Storage to distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800),     # Distribution to after-sales support
    
    # Activities separated by multiple steps
    ('SS', 'RC'): (439200, 86400),      # Supplier selection to receiving
    ('SS', 'QI'): (453600, 90000),      # Supplier selection to quality inspection
    ('OP', 'CA'): (475200, 108000),     # Order placement to assembly
    ('RC', 'PT'): (86400, 28800),       # Receiving to product testing
    ('QI', 'WS'): (89600, 21600),       # Quality inspection to warehouse
    ('CA', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),      # Assembly to distribution
    ('PT', 'DT'): (115200, 28800),      # Testing to distribution
    ('SS', 'DT'): (864000, 172800),     # Supplier selection to distribution
    ('OP', 'AS'): (1728000, 259200),    # Order placement to after-sales
    ('RC', 'AS'): (1296000, 216000)     # Receiving to after-sales
}
```

This temporal profile captures:
1. Direct sequential activities with their natural delays
2. Long-range relationships between activities separated by multiple steps
3. Realistic variations in time delays (standard deviations)
4. Both short-term (hours) and long-term (weeks) time spans
5. Increasing variance for activities further apart in the process

The times are in seconds and account for:
- Business hours and working days
- International shipping delays
- Manufacturing complexities
- Quality control procedures
- Warehouse operations
- Distribution network variations
- After-sales service timing

The standard deviations generally increase for activities further apart in the process, reflecting the accumulation of variability across multiple steps.
