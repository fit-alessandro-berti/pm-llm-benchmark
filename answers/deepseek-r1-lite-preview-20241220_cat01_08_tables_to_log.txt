### Assumptions and Notes:

- **Multiple Events per Activity:** Each item picking, dispatch, and arrival is treated as a separate event to reflect the detailed process flow.
- **Missing Data:** For order 1004, there are no delivery or invoice records, so those events are omitted.
- **Resource Mapping:** Sales persons, warehouse pickers, carriers, and billing clerks are mapped using the Resources table.
- **Additional Attributes:** Included customer details, item information, and payment references to provide context for each event.

This event log captures the key steps in the order lifecycle, from creation to payment, and is suitable for process mining analysis.
