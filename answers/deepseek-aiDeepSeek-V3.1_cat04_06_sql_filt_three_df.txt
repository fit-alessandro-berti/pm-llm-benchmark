I'll help you create a DuckDB SQL query that identifies cases with the specific activity sequence and timing condition, then excludes those cases from the final result.

```sql
WITH cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
    FROM event_log e1
    INNER JOIN event_log e2 
        ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id 
        AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
    INNER JOIN event_log e3 
        ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id 
        AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
        AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
        -- Ensure no other events between these three
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 
            FROM event_log e_mid 
            WHERE e_mid.case_id = e1.case_id 
                AND e_mid.timestamp > e1.timestamp 
                AND e_mid.timestamp < e2.timestamp
        )
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 
            FROM event_log e_mid 
            WHERE e_mid.case_id = e1.case_id 
                AND e_mid.timestamp > e2.timestamp 
                AND e_mid.timestamp < e3.timestamp
        )
)

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

**Alternative approach using window functions:**

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as second_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as second_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND second_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (second_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **First approach**: Uses self-joins to find the exact sequence of three activities and ensures there are no other events between them using `NOT EXISTS` clauses.

2. **Second approach**: Uses window functions (`LEAD()`) to look ahead at subsequent activities within each case, making it more efficient and concise.

3. **Timing condition**: Both approaches check that the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days using `(second_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'`.

4. **Final result**: The outer query selects all events from cases that are NOT in the excluded list, returning the complete event log minus the events from problematic cases.

The window function approach is generally more efficient and easier to read, but both will achieve the desired result. The query returns all events from cases that don't have the specified sequence with the timing issue, ordered by case and timestamp for readability.
