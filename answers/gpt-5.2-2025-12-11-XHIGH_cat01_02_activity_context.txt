### 1) Recurring activities and how their meaning changes

- **Verify Documents (C001, C003)**  
  - 1st occurrence = *initial* verification step.  
  - 2nd occurrence = *re-verification* triggered by rework (either missing docs were provided, or an account correction happened).
- **Call Customer (C002)**  
  - 1st call = *information-gathering/clarification* (to understand a discrepancy).  
  - 2nd call = *closure/confirmation* (to confirm the fix was applied).

Additionally, even when not repeated within the same case, some labels clearly represent different intents across cases (e.g., “Call Customer” is used for missing documents vs. discrepancy clarification vs. asking a walk-in customer to return). The renaming below removes that ambiguity across the whole log.

### 4) Brief justification of naming choices (context clues used)

- **“Verify Documents”  split into “Initial …” vs “Re-…” variants**  
  - Clues: repeated within the same case *after* an intervening “Submit Additional” (C001) or “Adjust Account” (C003), plus the text “re-check / re-verify”.
- **“Call Customer”  purpose-specific call names**  
  - Clues: the “Additional Context” explicitly states the call intent (missing docs request vs discrepancy clarification vs follow-up confirmation vs asking customer to return).
- **“Initiate Request”  channel-specific “Receive Request …”**  
  - Clues: WebPortal vs BranchReception resources and “online portal” vs “walk-in” context.
- **“Adjust Account”  “Adjustment” vs “Correction” with reason**  
  - Clues: C002 is adjustment *after discrepancy clarification*; C003 is correction due to *missing info* (different triggers and semantics).
