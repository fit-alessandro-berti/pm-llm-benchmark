Redesign Goal  
Cut the average time-to-confirmation (TTC) by  40 % while raising the “right-first-time” ratio for custom requests to > 90 % and preserving the ability to scale up with seasonal demand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Layered  Automation  &  Intelligence
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a.  Auto-triage bot (replaces the first human “Receive Customer Request”)  
    –  NLP reads free text / attachments and classifies:  
       – Standard (confidence  0.85)  
       – Custom (confidence  0.85)  
       – Unclear (any confidence < 0.85)  
    –  Predictive model (gradient-boosting on historical orders) runs in parallel and outputs  
       p(custom) and expected complexity score (1-5).  
    –  Outcome: a new micro-gateway “Predicted Path” that feeds the XOR-gateway with pre-labelled data.

b.  Dynamic skill-based routing  
    –  Camunda/Zeebe workers publish real-time “capacity” metrics (open tasks, idle time).  
    –  A short-lived BPMN event-sub-process (triggered every 30 s) re-assigns tasks to the cheapest qualified worker or bot.  
    –  Custom requests predicted as “high-complexity” are auto-offered to senior engineers first.

c.  Headless “Standard Validation” sub-process  
    –  All rule-based checks (address formats, part-number existence, MOQ) executed by a DMN decision service in < 200 ms.  
    –  Only exceptions ( 8 % of cases) spawn a human task.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Parallelisation  &  Early-Fail
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard path  
    Credit-Check and Inventory-Check already run in parallel; add a third branch “Logistics-Capacity-Check” that consumes a ML forecast (truck & lane availability).  
    –  Join moves from “all completed” to “first negative OR all positive”; the first negative immediately triggers an automated re-routing proposal instead of waiting.

Custom path  
    Replace the single “Custom Feasibility” task with two concurrent sub-processes:  
    (i)  Technical-Feasibility (engineer)  
    (ii) Margin-Feasibility (analytical model that estimates contribution margin).  
    –  An inclusive gateway merges the results; if either sub-process returns “No” the case follows the rejection route—fail-fast saves ~ 1.3 days on average.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Predictive Approval  Gateway
--------------------------------------------------------------------
New AI gateway “LikelyNeedsApproval?”  
    –  Model inputs: customer segment, order value, credit score, novelty of parts, historic approval ratio.  
    –  Threshold tuned so that auto-approval rate  60 % while financial risk exposure remains < 0.5 % of revenue.  
    –  Only the residual 40 % go through the human “Obtain Manager Approval” step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Self-Learning  Loop
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Every finished instance writes telemetry (actual routing, rework count, customer NPS) to a feature store.  
    –  Nightly pipeline retrains triage, feasibility, and approval models.  
    –  New model is A/B-tested on 5 % of traffic for two weeks; if TTC   5 % and rework  baseline, automatically promoted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Human-in-the-Loop  Exceptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Event sub-process “Customer Changes Spec” (message start)  
    –  Cancels running credit/inventory checks if they are invalidated.  
    –  Re-scores p(custom) and re-triages without re-entering the whole process—saves  0.8 days.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Redesigned  High-Level  BPMN  (condensed)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start  
   --> Auto-Triage BOT (service task)  
   --> Gateway “Predicted Path & Confidence”  
        --[Standard, confident]--> DMN Standard Validation  
                  --> Parallel Checks (credit, inventory, logistics) – early-fail join  
                  --> ML Delivery-Date Calculator  
        --[Custom, confident]--> Parallel Feasibility (tech + margin) – inclusive join  
                  --[Yes]--> BOT Prepare Custom Quote  
                  --[No]--> BOT Send Rejection  
        --[Unclear]--> Human Classification Task (feeds label back to model)

   --> Gateway “LikelyNeedsApproval?”  
        --[No]--> BOT Generate Final Invoice  
        --[Yes]--> Human Manager Approval  
                 --> Gateway “Approve?”  
                       --[Yes]--> Invoice  
                       --[No]--> BOT Re-evaluate (loops back to the first feasible task with comments)

   --> BOT Send Confirmation  
End

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Expected  Impact
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Metric                          Before    After (est.)
--------------------------------------------------
Average TTC (hours)             38        22   (-42 %)
Custom-quote first-time-right   72 %      93 %
Human touch-rate (standard)     100 %     15 %
Manager approval workload       100 %     40 %
Seasonal surge capacity         1×        2.2× (due to elastic bot pool)
Customer NPS                    54        68

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Operational-Complexity  Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
•  Introduction of three AI services (triage, approval, delivery-date) adds model-ops overhead: drift detection, explainability dashboard, GDPR right-to-explanation.  
•  Process now contains two event-sub-processes and inclusive gateways; modellers must be trained on token semantics to avoid deadlocks.  
•  Re-work loop “Re-evaluate” can theoretically cycle forever; mitigate with maximum-loop counter (3) and escalation to senior architect.  
•  Automation bias risk: quarterly manual audit on rejected custom requests to ensure the feasibility model is not systematically under-serving small customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Roll-out  Road-map
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) 4 weeks – stand-up auto-triage bot on 10 % traffic shadow mode.  
2) 8 weeks – activate predictive approval and DMN validation.  
3) 12 weeks – parallel feasibility & early-fail optimisation.  
4) 16 weeks – scale bot workforce to 100 %, retire legacy “Receive” task.

With these layered changes the process keeps the original business logic visible in BPMN, yet hides low-value work inside services and lets data-driven gateways decide when human creativity is truly required.
