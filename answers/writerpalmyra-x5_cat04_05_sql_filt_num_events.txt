Here’s a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes your task:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

This query first identifies all `case_id`s that have six or fewer events using a correlated subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`. Then, it returns all columns from `event_log` for only those cases.

It ensures that entire cases are filtered out if they exceed the event threshold, preserving all events for cases that meet the condition.

Would you like a version that also includes the event count per case in the output, or optimized for performance on large logs?
