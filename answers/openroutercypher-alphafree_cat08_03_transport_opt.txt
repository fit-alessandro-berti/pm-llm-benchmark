**1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking:**

**Data Integration and Preprocessing:**

1.  **Event Alignment:** Standardize timestamp formats and align events across the four data sources (GPS, scanners, dispatch, maintenance) based on vehicle ID and event day. This requires creating a composite event log for each vehicle-day (using 'Case ID' concept).
2.  **Event Enrichment:** For each GPS location point, add relevant attributes from the dispatch data (planned stops, package counts) and scanner events (actual delivery milestones).
3.  **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing data (e.g., imputation for GPS gaps), remove duplicates, and resolve inconsistencies like mismatched timestamps in dispatch vs. actuals.
4.  **Attribute Engineering:** Create calculated fields like "Traffic Delay" (when consecutive GPS points show low speed but vehicle status is 'moving') and "Maintenance Stops" (linking unscheduled stops with subsequent maintenance logs).

**Process Discovery:**

1.  **Algorithm Choice:** Apply heuristic mining (e.g., Inductive Miner) to handle large event logs efficiently while preserving real-world complexity of logistics routes.
2.  **Filtering:** Use time/geographical filters to analyze specific urban vs. suburban areas or peak hours vs. off-peak.
3.  **Variant Analysis:** Create multiple models representing different route profiles (morning rush vs. afternoon residential) by clustering similar vehicle-day cases.

**Conformance Checking:**

1.  **Plan vs. Actual Overlay:** Visualize planned routes (dispatch) as a baseline and overlay actual paths (GPS + scanner data) to identify:
    * Sequence Deviations: Skipped stops or reordering of deliveries
    * Timing Differences: Actual arrival vs. planned time windows
    * Unplanned Stops: Off-route maintenance breaks, traffic delays, or failed delivery attempts
2.  **Deviation Metrics:** Quantify conformance issues by calculating:
    * Average Route Deviation (km) per vehicle-day
    * Count of Unplanned Stops >3 minutes
    * Percentage of Delivered vs. Planned Packages

**2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification:**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

1.  **On-Time Delivery Rate:** (Successful Deliveries within planned time window)/(Total Deliveries) per driver/route
2.  **Average Time per Stop:** Total stop duration (Arrive Customer to Depart Customer)/ # Stops
3.  **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** (Total Driving Time)/(Total Delivery Stop Time)
4.  **Fuel Efficiency:** Average km per liter using Vehicle ID + actual route distance (GPS) + maintenance records (fuel fill-ups)
5.  **Traffic Delay Impact:** Sum GPS entries with 'Speed <5' * duration, mapped to traffic congestion maps

**Bottleneck Identification:**

1.  **Frequency Analysis:** Find frequent patterns of consecutive events like "Low Speed > Engine Warning > Depot Stop" indicating mechanical issues
2.  **Geospatial Clustering:** Identify areas where multiple vehicles have "Low Speed" clusters indicating traffic hotspots
3.  **Correlation Mining:** Analyze correlation between high "Unplanned Stops" and vehicle age (maintenance log) or driver experience (driver ID)
4.  **Case Duration Analysis:** Compare cases where Actual Return to Depot > Planned End Shift by more than 15 minutes to reveal time management issues

**3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies:**

1.  **Route Planning Flaws:**
    * Evidence: Variants where Actual Route Distance  Planned Distance 
    * Validation: Compare high-variance routes (morning urban peak) vs. stable routes (residential afternoon)
2.  **Travel Time Underestimations:**
    * Evidence: Repeated cases where Actual Arrival at Stop > Planned Arrival +10min
    * Validation: Correlate low-speed GPS events with historical traffic data before planned times
3.  **Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
    * Evidence: Clustering of "Low Speed" events on major arterials
    * Validation: Overlay process maps with real-time traffic maps during different hours
4.  **Service Time Variability:**
    * Evidence: Wide range in "Scan at Customer - Depart Customer" for drivers
    * Validation: Compare average stop time per driver with customer feedback scores
5.  **Vehicle Reliability Issues:**
    * Evidence: Cases where "Engine Warning" triggers Maintenance Stop on similar vehicle models
    * Validation: Sequence discovery showing "Unscheduled Stop follows GPS Low Speed" pattern
6.  **Failed Delivery Consequences:**
    * Evidence: Routes with high "Delivery Failed (Attempted)" ratio
    * Validation: Variant analysis comparing first-attempt success vs. second-deliver attempts

* **KPI Threshold Alerts:** Automatic notifications for metrics exceeding defined thresholds
* **Root Cause Diagnostics:** One-click drill-down from deviations to underlying event log evidence

**Notes:**

* Process mining models for dynamic route adjustments should include fallback plans that prioritize safety over efficiency during peak traffic hours
* Driver training initiatives should incorporate human factors analysis to assess training efficacy through delivery attempt success improvements and customer satisfaction scores
* Predictive maintenance strategies integrate vehicle telematics data like engine RPM and coolant temperature to provide more accurate remaining useful life estimates for vehicle components
