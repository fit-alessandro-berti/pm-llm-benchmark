## Analysis of Each Case:

Let's first recap the general constraints outlined clearly by the description:

- Every case starts with **"Receive order"** followed by **"Check inventory"**.
- **"Authorize payment"** must occur after **"Check inventory"** but before **"Package items"**.
- **"Package items"** must come after **"Authorize payment"** and before **"Ship order"**.
- **"Ship order"** must follow **"Package items"**.
- If the inventory is insufficient, the order follows **"Receive  Check  Cancel  Close"**. After **"Cancel order"**, no further fulfillment activities (**Authorize, Package, Ship**) should occur.
- The activity **"Close order"** should always be the final step.

## Case-by-Case Examination:

### Case 1
| Timestamp        | Activity           |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 09:00            | Receive order      |
| 10:00            | Check inventory    |
| 11:00            | Authorize payment  |
| 12:00            | Package items      |
| 13:00            | Ship order         |
| 14:00            | Close order        |

**Analysis:**  
This case perfectly matches the intended "normal" scenario: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. No violations.

### Case 2
| Timestamp        | Activity           |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 09:00            | Receive order      |
| 09:30            | Check inventory    |
| 10:00            | Package items      |
| 10:30            | Authorize payment  |
| 11:00            | Ship order         |
| 11:30            | Close order        |

**Analysis:**  
Violation detected here. According to the normative rules:

> "Authorize payment" must occur **before** "Package items". Items must only be packaged after payment authorization. 

However, in Case 2, we have "Package items" before "Authorize payment", clearly violating sequence guidelines outlined in the normative description.

### Case 3
| Timestamp        | Activity           |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 09:00            | Receive order      |
| 09:20            | Check inventory    |
| 09:40            | Authorize payment  |
| 10:00            | Cancel order       |
| 10:30            | Ship order         |
| 11:00            | Close order        |

**Analysis:**  
Multiple violations detected here:

- **Cancel Order after Authorize Payment:**  
  According to the normative description, cancellation happens due to insufficient inventory and thus should proceed immediately after inventory checking. Authorize payment indicates sufficient inventory and is intended only for fulfillment scenarios. Hence, "Authorize payment" occurring before cancellation creates ambiguity and violates the logical scenario defined. (One could interpret this as an error.)

- **Ship Order after Cancel Order:**  
  Explicitly flagged by the normative description as illogical:
  > "Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.  
  Here, shipping occurs after cancellation, making this a clear and explicit violation of stated process rules.

Case 3 is seriously violating norms due to cancellation followed by fulfillment (shipping) activities and inappropriate timing of payment authorization.

### Case 4
| Timestamp        | Activity           |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 09:00            | Receive order      |
| 09:10            | Check inventory    |
| 09:20            | Cancel order       |
| 09:50            | Close order        |

**Analysis:**  
This case fits exactly the simplified cancellation scenario described explicitly: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. No violations.

### Case 5
| Timestamp        | Activity           |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 09:00            | Receive order      |
| 10:00            | Check inventory    |
| 10:30            | Authorize payment  |
| 11:00            | Ship order         |
| 11:30            | Close order        |

**Analysis:**  
Violation detected:
- "Ship order" occurs without preceding activity "Package items". According to normative rules:
> "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items"  
Thus, shipping directly after authorization (and completely skipping packaging) clearly violates the normative description.

## Summary of Violations:

| Case ID | Violations Identified                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | None (conforms entirely)                                              |
| **2**   | Packaging occurs before payment authorization is completed.           |
| **3**   | 1. Shipping occurs after cancellation. <br> 2. Payment authorization occurs in a scenario that ends with cancellation. |
| 4       | None (conforms entirely; cancellation scenario correctly followed)    |
| **5**   | Ship order occurs without "Package items"                             |

## Final Answer:

**Cases violating the normative process:**  
- **Case 2:** "Package items" before "Authorize payment."  
- **Case 3:** "Ship order" after "Cancel order," and inappropriate authorization of payment in a cancellation scenario.  
- **Case 5:** "Ship order" without preceding "Package items."

**Cases conforming completely:**  
- **Case 1** (Standard fulfillment)  
- **Case 4** (Proper cancellation sequence)
