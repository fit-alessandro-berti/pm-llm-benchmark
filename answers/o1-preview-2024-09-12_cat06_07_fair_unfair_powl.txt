Here's how you can construct the two POWL models based on the description provided.

**POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**

In this model, after the skill assessment, there is an XOR branching between a standard cultural fit evaluation and a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that provides a subtle advantage to certain applicants. This branching introduces potential unfairness into the hiring process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness check
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR branching for cultural fit and community affiliation check
BiasXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the root partial order and execution order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, BiasXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
root.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, BiasXOR)
root.order.add_edge(BiasXOR, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**POWL Model Without Unfairness:**

In this model, the potential source of bias is removed. After the skill assessment, all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation without any special community-based branching. This ensures that all applicants are treated equally in this stage of the process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness check
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the root partial order and execution order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
root.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

In both models:

- **Data Completeness Loop**: The `DataLoop` operator enforces a loop between `DataCompletenessCheck` and `RequestMoreInfo`, ensuring that applicants provide all necessary information before proceeding.
- **Execution Order**: The `StrictPartialOrder` and its `order` define the sequence in which activities are executed. Edges added to `root.order` specify that an activity must be completed before the next one begins.

By comparing these two models, you can see how the introduction or removal of the XOR branching at the cultural fit stage affects the fairness of the hiring process.
