Short answer: Model 1 is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process than Model 2.

Below is a concise reasoning structured by task.

1. Comparison with a typical Hire-to-Retire process

A “standard” (simplified) Hire-to-Retire flow usually assumes:
- Post_Job_Ad
- Screen_Candidates
- Conduct_Interviews (for shortlisted candidates)
- Make_Hiring_Decision
- Onboard_Employee (for selected candidate)
- Add_to_Payroll
- Close_Case

Core logical constraints:
- Screening and interviews must reasonably precede the hiring decision.
- Hiring decision must precede onboarding and payroll.
- Payroll should not be skipped if someone is actually hired and onboarded.
- The case is closed after all relevant work is done (and only if the process outcome—hire or no-hire—is logically consistent).

2. Anomalies in each model

Model 1

Definition (key edges):
- Post  Screen
- Screen  Decide
- Screen  Interview
- Decide  Onboard
- Onboard  Payroll
- Payroll  Close

Implications:
- Interviews are only constrained to happen after screening (Screen  Interview).
- There is no edge Interview  Decide or Decide  Interview.
  - So Decide can occur:
    - After Screen but before any Interview.
    - In parallel with or even before Interview is completed.
  - This breaks the usual dependency: interviews should inform (or at least not follow) the hiring decision.
- No path that skips Onboarding/Payroll after a (presumed positive) hiring decision:
  - Once Decide is done, Onboard  Payroll  Close must follow.
  - This implicitly assumes every decision leads to a hire, with no explicit support for “reject all candidates and close” as a distinct outcome.
  - This is a modeling limitation but still internally consistent: it represents a “decision = hire” branch only.

Severity assessment:
- Main anomaly: missing precedence Interview  Decide.
  - This is a logical quality issue: decisions may be made without or independent of interviews.
- Less severe anomaly: lack of explicit “no hire” path.
  - It narrows the semantics but does not violate the core integrity of the “hire” scenario it models.
- Importantly: if we interpret Decide as “positive hiring decision,” the sequence from Decide onward (Onboard  Payroll  Close) is coherent and mandatory, preserving core hire-to-retire integrity.

Model 2

Key constructs:
- loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)
  - After Decide, you can:
    - Execute Onboard once, then optionally repeat via skip-then-Onboard, etc.
    - Or (due to loop semantics) potentially exit without performing Onboard at all, depending on how you interpret the initial/exit condition.
- xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)
  - After onboarding loop, either:
    - Execute Payroll, or
    - Skip Payroll entirely.

Edges:
- Post  Screen
- Post  Interview  (Interview may occur in parallel with or even before finishing screening)
- Interview  Decide
- Decide  loop_onboarding
- loop_onboarding  xor_payroll
- xor_payroll  Close

Implications and anomalies:
- Screening and interviews ordering:
  - Interview only constrained to follow Post, not Screen.
  - So interviews can occur before or without completed screening.
  - That contradicts the usual screening-before-interview logic.
- Onboarding loop:
  - Potential repeated onboarding of the same employee (multiple Onboard_Employee executions).
  - Or depending on semantics, possible path that executes Decide and then exits the loop effectively without meaningful onboarding.
  - Multiple onboardings for one decision is unrealistic and threatens data/process integrity.
- XOR on Payroll:
  - Even after (repeated) onboarding, the model allows skipping Add_to_Payroll.
  - This is a severe violation: having a properly onboarded employee who is not added to payroll breaks core legal, financial, and HR integrity.
- No explicit “no hire” branch:
  - Similar to Model 1, but worse because it now allows:
    - A “hire” (onboarding) without the mandatory downstream payroll activity.

Severity assessment:
- Severe anomalies:
  - Possibility of hire (onboarded employee) without payroll.
  - Potential multiple or zero onboardings after a decision.
  - Interviews not clearly following screening.
- These anomalies undermine core obligations and consistency of Hire-to-Retire more than Model 1’s missing precedence.

3. Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process?

Model 1:
- Mostly preserves:
  - Post  Screen.
  - Decision before onboarding and payroll.
  - Obligatory onboarding and payroll once a hire-decision path is implied.
- Main issue:
  - Decision is not guaranteed to be informed by interviews (Interview not ordered before Decide).
  - No explicit “no hire” path.
- Still, the “happy path” (Screen  [Interview]  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close) is structurally present and cannot accidentally omit crucial post-decision steps.

Model 2:
- Introduces:
  - Misordered or parallelized screening/interviews.
  - A loop that allows unrealistic onboarding behavior.
  - An XOR that allows skipping payroll after onboarding.
- These are not just stylistic deviations; they violate fundamental correctness of a Hire-to-Retire process (e.g., employed but not paid).

Conclusion:
- Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process.
- Its anomalies are primarily about missing or incomplete dependencies (less severe).
- Model 2’s anomalies allow behavior that contradicts the essential semantics of hiring and employing (more severe), making Model 2 less faithful and less sound as a representation of the process.
