### Updated DECLARE Model with Bias-Mitigating Constraints
```python
declare_model = {

        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},    # Added: Ensure sensitive checks occur
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}           # Added: Ensure manual reviews occur

### Rationale for Added Constraints
1. **Existence for `CheckApplicantRace` and `ManualReview`**  
   - Ensures sensitive attribute checks (`CheckApplicantRace`) and manual reviews (`ManualReview`) are always possible in the process. This forces the system to account for sensitive demographics during reviews.

2. **Responded Existence: `CheckApplicantRace`  `RequestAdditionalInfo`**  
   - Prevents immediate biased decisions after sensitive checks by requiring a mitigation step (`RequestAdditionalInfo`). This ensures additional data is gathered before any final decision, reducing the risk of bias.

3. **Coexistence: `CheckApplicantRace`  `ManualReview`**  
   - Mandates that whenever sensitive attributes (e.g., race) are checked, a `ManualReview` must occur. This adds human oversight to counter algorithmic or implicit bias in automated decisions.

4. **Non-Coexistence: `CheckApplicantRace`  `FinalDecision`**  
   - Explicitly forbids direct transitions from sensitive checks to decisions. This prevents scenarios where `Reject`/`Approve` outcomes are influenced solely by sensitive attributes without mitigation.

### How These Constraints Reduce Bias
- **Mitigates Automated Bias**: By requiring `RequestAdditionalInfo` after `CheckApplicantRace`, the model prevents decisions based solely on sensitive attributes.  
- **Ensures Human Oversight**: Coexistence between `CheckApplicantRace` and `ManualReview` guarantees sensitive cases undergo scrutiny by human reviewers.  
- **Prevents Rushed Judgments**: Non-coexistence blocks direct paths from sensitive checks to decisions, forcing additional steps that reduce impulsive biased outcomes.  
- **Promotes Consistency**: Existence constraints ensure sensitive checks and reviews are integral to the process, normalizing fairness for all applicants.

These adjustments enforce procedural fairness by embedding checks-and-balances into the loan workflow, ensuring decisions are based on holistic assessments rather than biased attributes.
