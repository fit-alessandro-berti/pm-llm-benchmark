Here's a **DuckDB SQL query** that fulfills your requirements:

---

###  **Requirements Recap**:
1. Identify cases (`case_id`) with the **exact sequence**:
   - 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   - 'Create Order'
   - 'Confirm Order'
   (No other events from the same `case_id` between them)

2. Among those cases, only include those where the **time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days**.

3. **Exclude** these cases from the final result — return **all other events**.

---

###  **Final SQL Query (DuckDB)**

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify cases with the exact 3-step sequence
WITH sequence_candidates AS (
    SELECT
        e1.case_id,
        e1.timestamp AS t1,
        e2.timestamp AS t2,
        e3.timestamp AS t3
    FROM
        event_log e1
        JOIN event_log e2
            ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id
            AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp
            AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
            AND e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        JOIN event_log e3
            ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id
            AND e2.timestamp < e3.timestamp
            AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
            AND NOT EXISTS (
                SELECT 1
                FROM event_log e
                WHERE e.case_id = e1.case_id
                  AND e.timestamp > e1.timestamp
                  AND e.timestamp < e3.timestamp
                  AND e.activity NOT IN ('Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
            )
),
-- Step 2: Filter cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is > 5 days
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        sequence_candidates
    WHERE
        t3 - t2 > 5 * 24 * 3600  -- 5 days in seconds
),
-- Step 3: Return all events *excluding* those in filtered_cases
final_result AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases)
)

-- Final output
SELECT * FROM final_result
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

---

###  **Explanation**:

- **`sequence_candidates`**:
  - Finds all `case_id`s with the three activities in the correct order.
  - Ensures **no other events** are in between using a `NOT EXISTS` clause.

- **`filtered_cases`**:
  - Filters those cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is **more than 5 days**.

- **`final_result`**:
  - Returns all events **excluding** the filtered cases.

- **Final `SELECT`**:
  - Orders the result by `case_id` and `timestamp` for readability.

---

###  **Notes**:
- This assumes `timestamp` is stored as a **Unix timestamp (seconds)**.
  - If it's a `TIMESTAMP` type, use `DATE_DIFF('day', t2, t3) > 5` instead.
  - Adjust accordingly depending on your DuckDB setup.

Let me know if you need a version using `DATE_DIFF` for timestamp types.
