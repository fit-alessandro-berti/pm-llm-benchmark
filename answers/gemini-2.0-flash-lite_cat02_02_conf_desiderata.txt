**Analysis of Event Log:**

**1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Rules):**

*   **Case 2:** This case violates multiple normative rules:
    *   **Violation 1:** The `Risk Assessment` activity occurs before the `Credit Check` activity. The sequence is incorrect and violates the required ordering.
    *   **Violation 2:**  `Finalize Documentation` is performed after a `Loan Decision (Rejected)`.  This contradicts the rule that documentation should only be finalized if the loan is approved.

**2. Deviations from Desiderata (Recommended Practices):**

*   **Case 3:**
    *   **Deviation 1:** The `Credit Check` occurs more than 24 hours after `Application Received`. While not strictly forbidden, this violates the recommendation of completing the credit check within a short timeframe.
    *   **Deviation 2:** The `Inform Applicant` activity occurs a longer time after the `Loan Decision` than the recommended 48 hours.
    *   **Deviation 3:** There is no `Follow-up Call`.  This, again, is discouraged but not a violation.

**Interpretation and Justifications (Where Applicable):**

*   **Case 2:** The order of `Risk Assessment` before `Credit Check` suggests potential errors in the process.  The loan application may have been mishandled, perhaps by a staff member incorrectly starting a step, or by automation issues. The `Finalize Documentation` after the rejection could be a manual error, where someone incorrectly executed the next step after receiving the rejection result. A corrective procedure must be followed to prevent these violations.
*   **Case 3:** The delayed `Credit Check` and late communication with the applicant could be due to various factors like high workload, system delays, or holiday backlog. The missing follow-up call is also problematic.
