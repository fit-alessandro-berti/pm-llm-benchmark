Here are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions:

## 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (XOR Branch for Community Affiliation)

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
standard_cultural = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Bias point
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness: check data, if incomplete request more info and loop back
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# XOR choice after skill assessment: standard cultural fit OR community affiliation check (bias!)
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[standard_cultural, community_check])

# Main partial order with sequential dependencies
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_app, 
    data_loop, 
    skill_assess, 
    cultural_xor, 
    managerial_review, 
    final_decision
])

# Define execution order
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, managerial_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

**Key unfairness point**: The `cultural_xor` XOR operator creates two paths after skill assessment. Applicants flagged for community affiliation take the `CommunityAffiliationCheck` path, which gives them a subtle advantage (preferential treatment).

## 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness (Uniform Cultural Fit for All)

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities (no CommunityAffiliationCheck)
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Same for ALL applicants
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness (same as unfair model)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Main partial order - NO XOR branching, everyone gets same cultural fit evaluation
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_app, 
    data_loop, 
    skill_assess, 
    cultural_fit, 
    managerial_review, 
    final_decision
])

# Define execution order (strict sequence, no preferential paths)
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

**Key fairness improvement**: The unfair XOR branch is eliminated. All applicants follow the identical path through `CulturalFitCheck` with no special community affiliation evaluation that could introduce bias. The process maintains the data completeness loop and sequential structure but ensures uniform treatment at the cultural fit stage.
