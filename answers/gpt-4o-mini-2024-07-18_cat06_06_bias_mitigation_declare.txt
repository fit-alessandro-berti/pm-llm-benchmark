Here’s the updated `declare_model` dictionary with the newly added constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application process:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority` activities must coexist with `ManualReview`. This ensures that any decision made on sensitive demographic groups (like minorities) undergoes a manual review process, reducing the likelihood of biased outcomes based solely on automatic decisions.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - Introduced a response constraint from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that before any decision based on the applicant's race is made, a check to mitigate bias must occur, promoting fairness in evaluations of applicants from diverse backgrounds.

3. **Precedence Constraints:**
   - A precedence constraint requires that `CheckApplicantRace` event must precede `BiasMitigationCheck`. This enforces that the check is done in a controlled sequence, making sure bias considerations are tabled before any decisions are made.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - The relationship between `BiasMitigationCheck` and `FinalDecision` ensures that any decision-making process must follow a bias mitigation check, which aims to ensure no immediate decisions are made based on sensitive attributes without proper bias controls.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - Prevents a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject` or `Approve`. This constraint forces a careful deliberation process before any decision can follow after evaluating sensitive attributes, thus minimizing the risk of hasty, biased conclusions based solely on demographics.

Collectively, these adjustments in the DECLARE constraints foster a more equitable process by requiring additional layers of scrutiny and manual review when processing applications from groups that may be disadvantaged by bias.
