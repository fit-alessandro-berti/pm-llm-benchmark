Here's the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints added to mitigate potential bias in the loan application review process:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints:

1. **Coexistence Constraints**:
   - **`"FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**: This ensures that every final decision is accompanied by a manual review, promoting fairness in the decision-making process.
   - **`"Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`** and **`"Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**: These ensure that decisions involving applicants from sensitive demographics are supervised, reducing the potential for biased judgments.

2. **Response Constraints**:
   - **`"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**: This means after checking sensitive attributes such as race, a bias mitigation check must occur, ensuring that decision-making is not influenced by any discriminatory factors directly.

3. **Precedence Constraints**:
   - **`"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**: This prevents a decision from being made immediately after checking a sensitive attribute without performing a bias mitigation check first, ensuring that potential biases are addressed before moving towards a decision.

4. **Succession Constraints**:
   - **`"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`** and **`"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**: These constraints enforce that decisions cannot be made without first completing a bias mitigation evaluation, fostering a mindful decision process.

5. **Non-succession Constraints**:
   - **`"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`** and **`"CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`**: These constraints inhibit a direct move from a sensitive attribute check to a decision, mitigating hasty or biased conclusions which often arise from insufficient evaluation.

These changes should help create a more equitable process for applicants, taking proactive steps to address bias and ensure that the loan application review is fair.
