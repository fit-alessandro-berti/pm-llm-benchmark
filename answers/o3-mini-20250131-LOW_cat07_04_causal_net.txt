This diagram is a **workflow/process model** that illustrates how a request (for example, a claim) moves through various activities and decisions before ultimately ending. It is paired with a **legend** of “split” and “join” patterns (XOR, AND, OR) often found in process modeling. Here is how to read it:

---

## 1. Overall Structure

- **Activities (the labeled boxes)**: Each box with a label such as “register request,” “examine thoroughly,” or “decide” represents a task or step in the process.  
- **Arrows / Edges**: Show how the process flows from one activity to the next.  
- **Small black circles**: Often represent “places” or intermediate states (especially in Petri nets), or simply connection points in other notations.

The process in the large diagram proceeds roughly from left to right:

1. **Register request** (labeled “a”) starts the workflow.  
2. Several **examination steps** (“examine thoroughly,” “examine casually,” “check ticket,” “reinitiate request”) can occur, with loops back and forth among them.  
3. Eventually, the process moves to a **decision** step (“decide”).  
4. After the decision, there are two main outcomes:  
   - **Pay compensation** (“g”), then end.  
   - **Reject request** (“y”), then end.  

The **end** is marked by “z.”

## 2. The Small Legend (Workflow Patterns)

In the inset (the smaller box of six patterns), you see typical **split** and **join** gateways or control-flow patterns:

1. **XOR-split** – A choice where exactly one branch is followed.  
2. **AND-split** – A parallel split where *all* branches run concurrently.  
3. **OR-split** – A conditional split where *one or more* branches might be followed.  
4. **XOR-join** – A merge that waits for exactly one incoming path.  
5. **AND-join** – A synchronization that waits for *all* parallel paths.  
6. **OR-join** – A more complex join that can wait for any combination of paths.

These patterns describe how the process may branch into multiple paths and later merge those paths back together. In a real notation (BPMN, Petri nets, EPC, etc.), these splits/joins may be shown by gateways, transitions, or other symbols.

## 3. Putting It All Together

- **Begin**: The request is registered (“a”).  
- **Middle**: There is a network of examination activities (b, c, d, f) which can loop among themselves—indicating the possibility of re-checking, doing a thorough or casual examination, and reinitiating the request if necessary.  
- **Decision**: Eventually, the process reaches a decision (“e”).  
- **End**: Based on the decision, the request is either compensated (“g”) or rejected (“y”), after which the workflow ends (“z”).  

The loops among “examine thoroughly,” “examine casually,” “check ticket,” and “reinitiate request” suggest the process can revisit those steps multiple times before moving on.

### In summary

- The **large diagram** is a concrete example of a workflow net (or similar process flow) showing how a request is handled from start to finish.  
- The **inset** with six smaller diagrams shows standard branching/merging patterns (XOR, AND, OR splits/joins) that modelers use to describe how work may split into multiple tasks or converge from multiple tasks.

All together, this visualization demonstrates both a **specific process** (the handling of a request through examination and decision) and the **generic patterns** used to represent branching and merging in process models.
