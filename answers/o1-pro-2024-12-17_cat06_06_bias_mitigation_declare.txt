**Explanation of Added Constraints:**

1. **Coexistence (Approve_Minority / Reject_Minority with ManualReview):**  
   By adding a coexistence constraint ensuring that whenever a minority applicant receives a final decision (`Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), a `ManualReview` step must appear in the trace, we force the process to include human oversight. This reduces the likelihood of unchecked biases influencing the outcome.

2. **Response (CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck):**  
   The response constraint ensures that after `CheckApplicantRace` occurs, a `BiasMitigationCheck` is eventually performed. This requires the process to incorporate a fairness assessment step whenever sensitive attributes are considered, preventing immediate or implicit biased decisions based solely on race data.

3. **Precedence (BiasMitigationCheck before Approve/Reject):**  
   By introducing a precedence constraint that `Approve` or `Reject` steps can only occur after a `BiasMitigationCheck`, we ensure that no final decision is made without first conducting a bias mitigation review. This safeguards that decisions are not just influenced by sensitive attributes without thorough vetting.

4. **Non-succession (CheckApplicantRace to Reject):**  
   The non-succession constraint prevents a direct jump from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject`. This ensures that discovering an applicantâ€™s sensitive attribute (such as race) cannot be immediately followed by a negative outcome without intermediate fairness checks, preventing a rushed and potentially biased decision.

Overall, these added constraints create a structured pathway that mitigates bias by enforcing extra checks and balances (like `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`) around the activities related to sensitive attributes and critical decisions. This structured approach helps ensure fairness and consistency in the decision-making process.
