Process enhancement, also known as process refinement or process improvement, is a technique used in Process Mining to improve an existing business process by identifying areas for optimization. It involves analyzing data from operational data sources to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for process improvement.

Here's how process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking:

**Process Discovery:**

* Process mining extracts the underlying patterns, rules, and structures of a process from historical event logs.
* The goal is to create a descriptive model of the current process as it is performed in reality.
* The resulting process model represents the actual flow of an organization's processes.

**Conformance Checking:**

* Conformance checking measures how well an organization conforms to its own predefined process model.
* By comparing actual work against the idealized model, conformance checking pinpoints deviations from expected behavior.
* The goal is not necessarily to improve the process but rather to assess whether the organization is adhering to established norms.

**Process Enhancement (Refinement or Improvement):**

* Process enhancement goes beyond simply analyzing and monitoring a process; it actively seeks ways to improve its efficiency, reduce cycle times, enhance quality, or simplify tasks.
* It focuses on real-world problems and areas for improvement, often driven by business needs, customer feedback, or continuous learning from metrics analysis.
* The outcome is an optimized version of the original process that meets specific requirements or addresses identified pain points.

Key differences:

1. Purpose:  Process discovery focuses on understanding a process as it exists in reality, while conformance checking ensures the organization adheres to its pre-defined model. Enhancement aims to create a better experience by streamlining and refining the process.
2. Approach:  Conformation is performed using static and dynamic conformance techniques based strictly upon existing models whereas process enhancement goes beyond this process as they attempt at understanding real-world challenges and develop solutions.
3. Focus:  Process discovery only analyzes historical data for patterns, rules, and structures used in current processes while conformance checking assesses operational processes against predefined models. The enhancement focuses on discovering opportunities to better improve an existing system with improved cycle times; higher quality output & enhanced customer satisfaction.
