To address the given prompt, we need to construct a DuckDB SQL query that follows the specified steps. Here is the detailed approach and the final query:

Step-by-Step Approach
Identify Sequences:

Use self-joins to identify cases that have the exact sequence of activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' in direct succession.
Ensure no other activities are in between these three.
Calculate Time Difference:

For the identified cases, calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.
Filter out cases where this time difference is more than 5 days.
Exclude These Cases:

Exclude events from the cases that meet both the sequence and time criteria from the final result.
Final Query
sql
WITH SequencedCases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
    FROM event_log e1
    JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp
    JOIN event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e2.timestamp < e3.timestamp
    WHERE 
        e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND
        e2.activity = 'Create Order' AND
        e3.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM event_log e4
            WHERE e4.case_id = e1.case_id AND
                  e4.timestamp > e1.timestamp AND
                  e4.timestamp < e3.timestamp AND
                  e4.activity NOT IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
        )
),
FilteredCases AS (
    SELECT sc.case_id
    FROM SequencedCases sc
    JOIN event_log e1 ON sc.case_id = e1.case_id AND e1.activity = 'Create Order'
    JOIN event_log e2 ON sc.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    WHERE e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM FilteredCases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
Explanation
SequencedCases CTE:

This common table expression (CTE) identifies cases that have the exact sequence of activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' in direct succession.
It uses self-joins to match the sequence and ensures no other activities are in between these three using a NOT EXISTS clause.
FilteredCases CTE:

This CTE selects cases from SequencedCases where the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events is more than 5 days.
It joins the sequence cases with the event log to get the timestamps for 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' and calculates the difference.
Final SELECT:

The final query selects all events from event_log excluding those cases identified in FilteredCases.
It orders the result by case_id and timestamp for readability.
This query ensures that only events from cases that do not meet both the specified sequence and the timing condition are included in the final result.
