**Normative Rule Violations and Their Reasons:**

1. **Case 2:** This case has two significant violations:
   - The "Risk Assessment" activity occurs before the "Credit Check", violating the ordering rule that requires "Credit Check" to happen before "Risk Assessment".
   - After the loan is rejected, "Finalize Documentation" is still performed, which is explicitly not allowed according to the normative process rules.

**Desiderata Violations:**

1. **Case 1:** No desiderata violations observed.
2. **Case 2:** Beyond the normative violations, there's also a desiderata issue that isn't directly stated but can be inferred. The lack of a delay between some activities might imply execution within the recommended timeframes, but given the process deviations, timing adherence is less clear.
3. **Case 3:** This case fails to meet two desiderata conditions:
   - The "Credit Check" occurs more than 24 hours after the application is received, violating the recommended timing for completing the credit check.
   - The applicant is informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision, violating the promptness desideratum for informing the applicant.
   - Additionally, there is no "Follow-up Call" conducted before closing the case, which, while not strictly required, is a recommended practice to ensure alignment with all parties involved.

**Interpretations and Justifications:**

- **Case 2**'s deviations could stem from process misunderstandings or deliberate process skipping, indicating a need for additional training or process adherence reinforcement.
- **Case 3**'s desiderata violations might result from operational delays or understaffing, suggesting that resources or policies need adjustment to meet the preferred timelines and practices.

Overall, **Case 2**'s normative violations are of high priority to address to ensure compliance with critical process rules. Meanwhile, **Case 3**'s desiderata violations, while less severe, highlight areas for improvement in operational efficiency and customer service quality.
