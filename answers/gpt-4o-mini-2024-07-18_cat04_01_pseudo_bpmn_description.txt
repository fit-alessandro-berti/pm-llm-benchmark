The pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, distinguishing between standard and custom requests. Here’s a detailed explanation of each step, gateway meanings, paths, and conditions for approvals or rework:

### Process Overview
This process begins with receiving a customer request and proceeds through various tasks depending on the type of request (standard or custom). The objective is to validate the request, either generate a quotation or invoice, and send a confirmation to the customer.

### Steps and Their Purposes

1. **Start Event**: Marks the beginning of the process flow when a customer request is received.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**: The initial task where the request from the customer is documented and prepared for processing.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**: This exclusive gateway checks whether the request is a standard or custom request, directing the flow accordingly.

   **Branch 1: If Type = Standard**
   - **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**: Conduct pre-defined checks to ensure that the standard request meets necessary criteria.
   - **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**: This inclusive gateway allows multiple tasks to run concurrently.
       - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**: Verifies the customer’s creditworthiness.
       - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**: Confirms that necessary items are in stock for fulfilling the order.
   - **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**: Marks the completion of the parallel checks before moving to the next task.
   - **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**: Determines when the order can be delivered based on inventory and logistics.

   **Branch 2: If Type = Custom**
   - **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**: Assesses if the customer's custom request is feasible based on resources and capabilities.
   - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**: Decides if the custom request can be fulfilled.
       - **If Yes**: 
           - **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**: Generating an appropriate quotation for the customer based on the feasibility analysis.
       - **If No**: 
           - **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**: Communicating to the customer that the request cannot be accommodated.
           - **End Event**: This path concludes here, terminating the process for this request.

4. **After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed**: At this point, the process checks if further approval is needed after either generating an invoice or a custom quotation.

   - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**: Determines if manager approval is required before proceeding.
       - **If Yes**:
           - **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**: The request is sent to management for approval.
           - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**: Checks the outcome of the approval request.
               - **If Yes**:
                   - **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**: Finalizes the transaction with the customer.
               - **If No**:
                   - **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**: Revisiting the conditions surrounding the request.
                       - This involves looping back to Task E1 (for a custom request) or Task D (for a standard request), indicating a need for rework or adjustments based on manager feedback.
       - **If No Approval Needed**:
           - **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**: Proceeds directly to finalize the transaction if manager approval isn’t required.

5. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**: Regardless of the path taken, this task ensures that the customer receives notification regarding their order status.

6. **End Event**: Marks the conclusion of the process after confirmation has been sent.

### Path Convergence and Loops
- The paths converge when the tasks related to approvals either allow for a direct generation of the invoice or necessitate reevaluation, leading back to earlier tasks.
- The loops signify that further analysis may be required depending on feedback or initial validation outcomes. This ensures that the request can be modified or improved upon based on manager direction.

### Conditions for Approvals and Rework
- **Manager Approval Needed**: Triggered when the process determines that oversight is necessary.
- **Rework Conditions**: Initiated if the customization is not feasible or if manager approval is denied, prompting a return to relevant tasks to address concerns or collect additional information.

### Conclusion
This pseudo-BPMN effectively illustrates a structured approach to managing customer requests, allowing for both standard processes and more flexible responses to custom inquiries, while incorporating necessary checks and balances through gateways that facilitate decision-making and ensure quality control.
