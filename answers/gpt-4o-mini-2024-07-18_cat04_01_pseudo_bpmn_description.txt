The provided pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, with distinct paths based on the type of request (either standard or custom). Below is a detailed explanation of each step, the purposes of the gateways, the flow of tasks, and the conditions for approvals and rework.

### Process Overview

The process begins with the reception of a customer request and follows different paths depending on whether the request is categorized as **standard** or **custom**. The ultimate goal of this process is to handle the request properly, ensuring that all necessary checks are performed, and ultimately generating an invoice to confirm the transaction.

### Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Start Event**: This marks the initiation of the process when a customer request is received.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**: This is the initial step where the company acknowledges the customer's request and begins the processing.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**: This exclusive gateway determines the path to take based on the type of request. There are two branches:
   - **Standard Request**: If the request is identified as standard, it follows Task B1.
   - **Custom Request**: If it is identified as custom, the process follows Task B2.

4. **[If Type = Standard] Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**: 
   - This task involves checks specific to standard requests. It usually includes validating necessary information and criteria.

5. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**: Here, the process employs parallel processing to improve efficiency. Both tasks C1 and C2 occur simultaneously:
   - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**: Validates the customer's creditworthiness.
   - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**: Confirms if the requested products are in stock.

6. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**: This step indicates that both credit and inventory checks must be completed before proceeding.

7. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**: After confirmation of credit and inventory, the team calculates when the product can be delivered to the customer.

8. **[If Type = Custom] Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**: 
   - For custom requests, a feasibility analysis is conducted to assess whether the requested customization can be achieved.
  
9. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**: This gateway determines the outcome of the feasibility analysis:
   - **[If Yes] Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**: If feasible, a custom quotation is prepared for the customer.
   - **[If No] Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**: If not feasible, a rejection notice is sent to the customer, and the process ends here.

10. **After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed**: Once either the standard validation or custom quotation is complete, the process routes to another decision point.

11. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**: This gateway checks if manager approval is necessary before proceeding to invoice generation:
    - **[If Yes] Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**: The process waits for a manager's approval.
    
12. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**: Following the request for approval, this gateway checks the outcome:
    - **[If Yes] Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**: If approval is granted, the final invoice is generated.
    - **[If No] Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**: If approval is not granted, conditions are reconsidered, and the flow loops back:
        - For **Custom Path**: It loops back to **Task E1** to adjust the quotation.
        - For **Standard Path**: It loops back to **Task D** to reassess the delivery date or conditions.

13. **[If No Approval Needed] Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**: If no approval is needed, the process directly moves to invoice generation.

14. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**: After the invoice has been generated, a confirmation is sent to the customer to inform them about the next steps.

15. **End Event**: This signifies the completion of the process.

### Summary of Approvals and Rework Steps

- The need for approval (Task F) is contingent upon whether the request meets certain criteria (decided in the XOR gateway). If approval is needed, the request goes through a verification process.
- If approval isn't granted (as assessed in Gateway XOR for approval), there can be a re-evaluation which may trigger revisions in either standard validations or customized quotations. This is done to facilitate a better outcome that may satisfy both the request and the company's process criteria. 

### Conclusion

This pseudo-BPMN representation effectively captures the decision points and workflows associated with processing customer requests. The differentiation between standard and custom requests allows for tailored approaches, while the approval steps ensure that managerial oversight is in place, maintaining quality control through the overall process.
