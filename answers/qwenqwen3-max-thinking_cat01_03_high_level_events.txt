Based on the provided event log sample, I have analyzed the sequence, semantics, resources, and temporal proximity of low-level events to derive a set of coherent, high-level manufacturing process steps. Below is the structured output.

### **Proposed High-Level Process Steps**

| High-Level Step Name      | Included Low-Level Activities                                                                 | Rationale for Grouping                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Material Preparation** | • Retrieve raw metal sheet<br>• Scan barcode<br>• Place metal sheet on table<br>• Align metal sheet<br>• Preheat metal sheet | These activities occur at the very beginning of each case and are focused on getting the raw material ready for processing. They involve setup, identification, positioning, alignment, and thermal conditioning—all essential preparatory actions before any fabrication begins. All are temporally clustered and logically sequential. |
| **2. Welding Assembly**     | • Pick up welding tool<br>• Weld corner A<br>• Weld corner B                                  | These events represent the core fabrication step where structural joining occurs. The tool pickup is a necessary precursor to welding, and both weld actions are identical in type and closely timed, indicating a single assembly operation. Performed by the same operator (Operator B), reinforcing cohesion. |
| **3. Weld Quality Verification** | • Measure weld integrity                                                                     | This is a dedicated, automated inspection step immediately following welding, using a quality sensor to assess structural integrity. It serves as a discrete quality gate before proceeding to downstream steps. Though a single event, it represents a distinct verification phase. |
| **4. Surface Coating**      | • Apply protective coating<br>• Dry coating                                                   | These two steps form a complete surface treatment phase: application of a protective layer followed by controlled drying. Both are machine-performed (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2) and occur consecutively, indicating a unified finishing process. |
| **5. Final Visual Inspection** | • Visual check                                                                               | Conducted by a human operator (Operator C) at the end of the process, this is a manual quality assurance step that confirms overall readiness for shipment or next stage. It is temporally and logically the final verification before process completion. |

### **Key Grouping Principles Applied**

1. **Temporal Proximity**: Events occurring within seconds of each other and without interruption from unrelated tasks were grouped.
2. **Functional Cohesion**: Activities contributing to the same physical or logical objective (e.g., preparing material, joining parts, applying finish) were aggregated.
3. **Resource Consistency**: Steps performed by the same operator or machine type (e.g., Operator B for welding) indicated a unified task.
4. **Process Flow Logic**: The sequence follows a natural manufacturing progression: prepare  assemble  inspect  finish  final check.
5. **Quality Gates**: Inspection steps (automated and manual) were treated as distinct phases due to their role in process control.

### **Final High-Level Process Workflow**

1. **Material Preparation**  
2. **Welding Assembly**  
3. **Weld Quality Verification**  
4. **Surface Coating**  
5. **Final Visual Inspection**

This abstraction reduces 12 low-level events per case into 5 interpretable, domain-meaningful stages—enabling clearer process monitoring, bottleneck analysis, and compliance tracking in the manufacturing workflow.
