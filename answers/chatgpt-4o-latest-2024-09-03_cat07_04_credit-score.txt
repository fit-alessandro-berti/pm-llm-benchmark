The provided diagram represents a business process, likely modeled using BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). It depicts the steps and interactions related to handling a credit scoring request between two entities: "Credit Scoring (Bank)" and "Scoring Service."

### Swimlanes:
1. **Credit Scoring (Bank)**: The top swimlane represents processes within the bank dealing with a credit scoring request.
2. **Scoring Service**: The bottom swimlane represents processes carried out by a third-party scoring service in response to the bank's request.

### Process Flow:

#### In the "Credit Scoring (Bank)" Swimlane:
1. **Scoring Request Received**: 
   - The process starts with the event "scoring request received" (an envelope icon).
   
2. **Request Credit Score**: 
   - The bank sends a request to the scoring service for a credit score.
  
3. **Report Delay or Receive Credit Score**:
   - If there is a delay or if no immediate score is available, "delay information" is received, and the "report delay" step is executed within the bank.
   - If the credit score information is received, it proceeds directly to the "send credit score" step.
 
4. **Check for Delay**:
   - The process includes a decision gateway that leads to two possible outcomes:
     - If the credit score is eventually received (marked with the message "credit score received"), the bank proceeds to send the credit score.
     - If no score is received, the process is completed using the "report delay" step.

5. **Send Credit Score**: 
   - The credit score is sent, and the process in the bank is completed with the "scoring request handled" event.

#### In the "Scoring Service" Swimlane:
1. **Scoring Request Received**:
   - The scoring request is also received in the scoring service for further processing.
   
2. **Compute Credit Score (Level 1)**: 
   - The service first tries to compute the credit score at "Level 1".

3. **Score Available Decision**: 
   - A decision gateway checks if the score is available after the first computation attempt.
     - **If yes**, the score is sent back to the bank.
     - **If no**, a delay is reported, leading to "compute credit score (Level 2)," initiating a deeper computation process.
     
4. **Compute Credit Score (Level 2)**: 
   - If the first level computation fails, a second level computation takes place, and if successful, the score is sent (along with an ID for message queuing).

   - After the second-level computation, the score is sent again, ending with the process completing via "scoring request handled."

### Key Symbols:
- **Envelope Icons**: Represent message events (e.g., receiving or sending a request).
- **Rectangular Shapes**: Represent tasks such as "request credit score," "compute credit score," or "report delay."
- **Diamond (X)**: Represents gateways or decision points.
  
### Summary:
The process shows how a credit scoring request is handled between a bank and a scoring service. It goes through multiple steps, including request, computation, decision handling on availability, potential delay reporting, and sending the final credit score back to the bank. The scoring service has two levels of computation, and the flow includes mechanisms to manage delays and continue the process accordingly.
