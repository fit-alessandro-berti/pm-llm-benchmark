# 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics Using Process Mining

### Reconstructing Job Flows & Task Sequences
- **Event Log Preparation:**  
  Parse the MES logs to construct *cases* where each case corresponds to a unique job (e.g., `JOB-7001`). Each event is a recorded task or state change with timestamps, resources, and task attributes.

- **Process Discovery:**  
  Use *process discovery* algorithms (e.g., Heuristic Miner, Inductive Miner) to reconstruct job routing variants, revealing:
  - Precise paths (task sequences) each job follows.
  - Variants and deviations from planned routings.
  - Forks, joins, and loops (e.g., rework loops after Quality Inspection).
  
- **Control-flow & Conformance Analysis:**  
  Examine deviations between planned sequences and actual executions.

- **Event Correlation by Resource:**  
  Map task events onto specific resources (machines/operators) over time to visualize resource-level usage.

### Metrics & Measurements from Process Mining

| Aspect                          | Technique / Metric                                                      | Description / Calculation Method                                         |
| -------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, Makespan** | *Case Duration Analysis* | Measure duration from job release (case start) to job completion end event (case end). Use boxplots/histograms for distribution. Calculate average, variance, and percentiles. |
| **Task Waiting Times**          | *Waiting time extraction via timestamps*                             | For each task, compute time spent in queue before setup/task start. Queue Entry timestamp  Setup Start timestamp (or Task Start if no setup). Aggregate per machine/task. |
| **Resource Utilization**        | *Resource workload graphs & utilization ratio*                       | For each machine/operator, calculate productive time (task execution), setup time, idle time (gap between tasks). Utilization = Productive time / Available time. Use Gantt charts and utilization plots. |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times** | *Adjacency matrix and sequence mining*                              | For each machine, analyze sequences of jobs processed. Identify setup events and their durations associated with different job pairs (previous job  current job). Build a matrix of average setup durations for each job-pair combination. Use frequent pattern mining or Markov models on job sequences. |
| **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness** | *Deviation & lateness metrics*                                       | Compare Actual Completion time vs. Due Date for each job. Compute:  
    - Tardiness = max(0, Completion - Due Date)  
    - Frequency of tardy jobs (% of jobs late)  
    - Average and maximum tardiness  
    - Late jobs per priority class |
| **Impact of Disruptions**       | *Event correlation and KPI degradation analysis*                     | Time align breakdown events with observed delays/tardiness spikes. Use:
    - Interrupted task timelines  
    - Queue growth after breakdowns  
    - Compare KPIs before and after disturbance windows  
    - Priority change events (hot jobs) analyzed for their effect on other jobs’ delays |

# 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies from Performance Analysis

### Identified Pathologies & Evidence Using Process Mining

| Pathology / Inefficiency          | Process Mining Diagnostic Approach / Evidence                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bottleneck Identification & Impact** |  
- Use *resource utilization analytics*: Identify machines consistently nearing 100% utilization and exhibiting long queues.  
- *Throughput time correlation*: High flow times for jobs using bottleneck machines.  
- *Blocking* or *starvation* effects: Upstream task completion delayed due to bottleneck queues. |
| **Poor Prioritization Leading to Delays** |  
- Variant analysis on on-time vs late jobs by priority class using *declining set analysis*.  
- Identify if high-priority or urgent jobs are not processed earlier despite rules — e.g., priority changes not reflected in queue reorderings.  
- Inspect flow times and queue times vs priority levels. |
| **Suboptimal Sequencing Increasing Setup Times** |  
- Mining frequent transitions & setup time matrices reveals large setup durations triggered by certain job sequences.  
- Identify if machine sequences repeatedly incur high setup times due to dispatching ignoring setups.  
- Compare setup times during different sequencing strategies logged. |
| **Downstream Resource Starvation** |  
- Trace *work item arrival patterns* at downstream machines.  
- Inspect if starvation intervals or empty queues exist while upstream are congested.  
- Analyze *hand-off delays* between stations in the event log. |
| **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels** |  
- Time-series analysis of queue lengths and WIP per work center.  
- Variance amplification in WIP over sequential stages, tied to scheduling variability.  
- Correlate WIP volatility with dispatching rules and disruptions scenarios. |
| **Disruptions and Their Effects** |  
- Overlay breakdown events with cascading delay statistics.  
- Heatmaps showing delay propagation after disruptions.  
- Statistical comparisons of flow times pre- and post-breakdown periods. |

# 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

| Cause Category                       | Potential Root Causes & Process Mining Implications                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Limitations of Static Dispatching** | Dispatching rules ignoring multiple factors and job interactions. Process mining shows mismatch between priority/workload and actual scheduling decisions. |
| **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**    | Inability to adapt schedules dynamically to breakdowns, machine availability. Logs reveal delayed queue updates and throughput fluctuations during disruptions. |
| **Inaccurate Task & Setup Time Estimates** | Process mining reveals large variances between planned and actual durations, often not accounted for, causing unrealistic schedules. |
| **Poor Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups** | Logs show high setup times due to disregard for sequencing effects in scheduling logic. Mining confirms lack of setup-time aware dispatching. |
| **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers** | Upstream bottlenecks cause starvation downstream. Process mining shows queues growing upstream but starvation downstream. |
| **Inadequate Responses to Unplanned Events** | Logs reveal delays in reprioritization and resource rescheduling after breakdowns or priority changes. No closed-loop adaptation is visible. |

### Differentiating Causes via Process Mining

- **Poor Scheduling Logic vs Resource Limits:**  
  Use *simulation-based what-if analyses* grounded on real log data: test if improvements in dispatching reduce delays without adding resources.  
- **Quantify Variability Effects:**  
  Analyze distributions of task times and identify inherent variability boundaries. If variability alone causes delays beyond scheduling logic shortcomings.  
- **Resource Capacity vs Scheduling Interaction:**  
  Correlate throughput drops with capacity constraints; if capacity is sufficient but scheduling wastes time (high idle due to poor sequencing), point to scheduling faults.

# 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: **Dynamic Multi-Criteria Dispatching Rules Incorporating Sequence-Dependent Setups**

- **Core Logic:**  
  Move beyond EDD/FCFS by combining weighted factors dynamically per machine queue:
  - Remaining processing time of jobs (to minimize flow time)
  - Urgency reflecting due dates and order priority  
  - *Estimated* sequence-dependent setup time, based on transitioning from the last processed job  
  - Downstream machine load indicators (avoid blocking downstream bottlenecks)  
- **Process Mining Inputs:**  
  - Historical setup time matrices to estimate setup for each candidate job in queue.  
  - Distribution of task durations by job and operator to estimate remaining processing times accurately.  
  - Queue length and utilization stats for downstream machines as feedforward signals.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  - Reduces tardiness by prioritizing urgent jobs with low setup costs.  
  - Decreases WIP via balancing upstream/downstream loads.  
  - Improves utilization by reducing idle/setup overhead.  
- **Example Implementation:**  
  Score jobs as  
  `Score = w1*(Due Date Urgency) + w2*(Inverse Remaining Processing Time) + w3*(1/Setup Time Estimate) + w4*(Downstream Capacity Metric)`  
  Select job with highest score.

  - Construct schedules with buffers where predicted breakdown risk is high.  
  - Trigger dynamic rescheduling or resource reallocation based on breakdown prediction and actual early warning signals.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  - Reduces unexpected delays and tardiness.  
  - Improves make-span predictability and lead time estimates.  
  - Enhances machine utilization stability.

### Strategy 3: **Setup-Time Optimization via Intelligent Job Batching and Sequencing**

- **Core Logic:**  
  - Group jobs with similar tooling/setups to be processed consecutively at bottleneck machines.  
  - Optimize job sequences based on historical setup time data to minimize total setup duration across sequences.  
- **Process Mining Inputs:**

  - Batch jobs with similar setups released in windows or triggered dynamically when enough accumulate.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  - Significant reduction in overall setup time and higher machine throughput.  
  - Smooths workload, reducing stochastic delays caused by random sequencing.  
  - Potentially reduces WIP buildup by coordinated batching.
