Looking at the differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group, we can highlight several main differences based on the process variant descriptions and execution times:

1. **Starting the Process:**
   - The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of cases where the process starts with 'Register at FD' followed by an 'Expert Examination' (with high performance/execution times), suggesting that this group often undergoes more thorough initial assessments.
   - Conversely, the protected group has a notable number of cases where the process starts simply with 'Register at ER' or 'Register at FD', potentially indicating instances where the assessment phase might be skipped or is less thorough initially.

2. **Increased Thorough Examinations:**
   - The unprotected group frequently undergoes 'Thorough Examinations' (both before and after initial diagnosis) with a higher frequency and longer execution times compared to the protected group, suggesting a potentially more detailed level of assessment and follow-up for this group.

3. **Frequency of Treatment Success and Unsuccess:**
   - Both groups have similar variants ending in 'Treatment successful -> Discharge,' but the unprotected group has considerably more cases involving 'Treatment unsuccessful' stages that lead to further diagnosis and treatment attempts. This could indicate that the unprotected group is more prone to needing additional rounds of treatment for initial problems to be successfully resolved, possibly due to more complex or nuanced health issues.

4. **Discharge Count and Non-assessed Cases:**
   - The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of the straight 'Discharge' variant (without any examination or treatment detail), which can be concerning, possibly indicating a higher rate of patients leaving the system without receiving a full assessment.

5. **Process Flow Complexity:**
   - The unprotected group has more complex and lengthy process variants that involve multiple rounds of treatment following unsuccessful treatments. This may indicate more in-depth engagement with healthcare resources or a need for repeated interventions in this group.

6. **Performance Times:**
   - Across most process variants, the unprotected group has higher performance times, which may be due to longer or repeated treatment phases and assessments.

These observations imply possible disparities in how medical treatment is initiated, progressed, and finalized between protected and unprotected groups. The unprotected group seems to undergo more extensive, time-consuming, and sometimes more repetitive medical interventions, raising questions about access, treatment protocols, and efficiency of care.
