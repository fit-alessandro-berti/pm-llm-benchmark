Let's analyze the event log step by step based on the **normative process behavior** and **desiderata**, and identify violations and suboptimal practices.

---

##  **Part 1: Normative Process Behavior Analysis**

###  Case 1:
**Process Flow:**
```
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
```

- **All activities follow the required sequence.**
- **No skipped steps, no incorrect ordering, and documentation finalized before closing an approved case.**

 **Verdict:** *No normative violations.*

---

###  Case 2:
**Process Flow:**
```
Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
```

####  Violations:
1. **Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check** – violates the strict ordering rule.
2. **Finalize Documentation occurs after a rejection** – directly against normative rules ("do not finalize documentation after a rejection").

 **Verdict:** *Violates normative constraints due to incorrect activity order and forbidden action after rejection.*

---

###  Case 3:
**Process Flow:**
```
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
```

- The sequence is correct.
- Finalization happens before closing (approved loan).
- No skipped steps.

 **Verdict:** *No normative violations.*

---

##  **Part 2: Desiderata Compliance Analysis**

###  Case 1:
- **Credit Check within 24 hours:**  Done 30 minutes after Application Received.
- **Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision:**  Done 2 hours after decision.
- **Follow-up Call:**  Not recorded.

 **Suboptimal Practice:** *Missing recommended Follow-up Call.*

---

###  Case 2:
- **Credit Check after Risk Assessment:**  Already a normative violation; also likely delayed beyond 24 hours.
- **Inform Applicant timing:**  Unknown exact time between decision and notification, but assuming promptness is violated.
- **Follow-up Call:**  Not recorded.

 **Suboptimal Practices:** *Delayed credit check, possibly delayed notification, missing follow-up call.*

---

###  Case 3:
- **Credit Check within 24 hours:**  Occurred 2 days later.
- **Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision:**  Took over 2 full days.
- **Follow-up Call:**  Not done.

 **Suboptimal Practices:** *Both timing recommendations violated, and no follow-up call.*

##  Summary of Findings

| Case ID | Normative Violation? | Description of Violation | Desiderata Issues |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| 1       | No                   | -                          | Missing Follow-up Call |
| 2       | Yes                  | - Risk Assessment before Credit Check<br>- Finalized documentation after rejection | Delayed credit check, possibly delayed notification, missing follow-up call |
| 3       | No                   | -                          | Credit check & notification delayed, missing follow-up call |

##  Interpretations and Justifications

###  Case 1:
- Fully compliant with normative rules.
- Only minor desideratum issue: Missing Follow-up Call.
  - Could be due to oversight or internal policy not strictly enforced.

###  Case 2:
- **Normative Violations:**
  - Performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check might indicate a procedural error or system misstep (e.g., manual override or data entry mistake).
  - Finalizing documentation after rejection is a **serious breach** and may point to human error or flawed system logic that doesn’t enforce conditional actions.
- **Justification:** Likely caused by lack of proper workflow control or training. Requires process review and automation improvements.

###  Case 3:
- No normative issues — all steps in correct order.
- **Desiderata Failures:**
  - Delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant may stem from resource constraints, backlog, or inefficient scheduling.
  - Missing Follow-up Call could reflect inconsistent adherence to best practices.
- **Justification:** Suboptimal performance possibly due to operational inefficiencies rather than intentional deviation.

##  Final Recommendations

1. **For Case 2:**
   - Investigate root cause of out-of-order execution.
   - Implement system-level checks to prevent Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
   - Enforce conditional logic: **no Finalize Documentation if Rejected**.

2. **For All Cases:**
   - Promote awareness of desiderata through training and internal guidelines.
   - Consider implementing soft alerts for delays beyond recommended timeframes.
   - Encourage Follow-up Calls as part of standard closing procedures.

3. **System Enhancements:**
   - Use workflow engines or BPM tools to enforce strict sequencing.
   - Add dashboards for tracking compliance with both mandatory and recommended timelines.
