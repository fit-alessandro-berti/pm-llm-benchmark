## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

To transform Precision Parts Inc.’s reactive, fragmented scheduling into a proactive, data-driven system, we begin by leveraging **process mining** on the MES event logs to reconstruct the *ground truth* of job flows, task sequences, resource utilization, and disruption impacts.

### a. **Reconstructing Job and Task Flows**

Using **process discovery algorithms** (e.g., Alpha Miner, Heuristics Miner, or Inductive Miner), we map the actual execution paths of jobs across workstations. Given the high variability in job routings, we treat each job as a unique case and analyze:

- **Control-flow models** per machine/workstation to understand task sequencing patterns.
- **Conformance checking** to compare actual execution against ideal or planned sequences (if available).
- **Variant analysis** to cluster jobs with similar routing patterns and identify frequent vs. exceptional paths.

This reveals not only the nominal workflow but also deviations caused by disruptions, rework, or ad-hoc prioritization.

### b. **Key Metrics & Process Mining Techniques**

#### i. **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, Makespan**
- **Technique**: Direct timestamp differencing between “Job Released” and “Job Completed” events.
- **Metrics**: 
  - *Distribution of total job lead times* (histograms, percentiles).
  - *Makespan*: total time from first job start to last job completion in a planning horizon.
  - *Cycle time per job stage* (e.g., time from Cutting start to Quality Inspection end).

*Process mining insight*: Overlay lead time distributions with due dates to visualize tardiness hotspots.

#### ii. **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times)**
- **Technique**: Calculate duration between “Queue Entry” and “Task Start” for each task at each resource.
- **Metrics**: 
  - Average, max, and 90th percentile queue time per machine.
  - Queue time as % of total task cycle time.
  - Correlation of queue time with upstream machine utilization.

*Process mining insight*: Use **performance mining** overlays on process maps to highlight bottlenecks with red/orange color-coding based on queue duration.

#### iii. **Resource Utilization**
- **Technique**: For each machine, calculate:
  - *Productive time*: Sum of “Task Start” to “Task End” durations.
  - *Setup time*: Sum of “Setup Start” to “Setup End” durations.
  - *Idle time*: Gaps between task end and next task start (excluding breakdowns).
  - *Breakdown time*: From “Breakdown Start” to “Breakdown End” (if logged).
- **Metrics**:
  - Utilization rate = (Productive + Setup) / Total Available Time.
  - Setup-to-Processing ratio per machine.
  - Operator utilization (if operator logs are granular).

*Process mining insight*: Generate **resource utilization heatmaps** over time to identify under/over-utilized periods and correlate with job releases or disruptions.

#### iv. **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**
- **Technique**: For each machine, extract consecutive job pairs (Job A  Job B) and record:
  - Setup duration for Job B.
  - Attributes of Job A and Job B (e.g., material type, dimensions, operation type).
- **Metrics**:
  - Average setup time by job attribute transition (e.g., Steel  Aluminum, Small  Large).
  - Variance in setup times for identical transitions.
  - Setup time clustering using decision trees or regression to identify key drivers.

*Process mining insight*: Build a **setup time transition matrix** per machine, enabling predictive setup time estimation for scheduling.

#### v. **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**
- **Technique**: For each job, compute:
  - *Tardiness* = MAX(0, Actual Completion Time – Due Date).
  - *Earliness* = MAX(0, Due Date – Actual Completion Time).
  - *On-time delivery rate* = % of jobs completed by due date.
- **Metrics**:
  - Average and total tardiness.
  - Tardiness distribution by priority level or customer.
  - Correlation between queue times at bottleneck machines and final job tardiness.

*Process mining insight*: Use **decision mining** to identify which factors (e.g., late arrival at CNC Milling, high setup time after dissimilar job) most strongly predict tardiness.

#### vi. **Impact of Disruptions**
- **Technique**: Correlate disruption events (breakdowns, priority changes) with:
  - Spike in queue times downstream.
  - Increase in job tardiness.
  - Ripple effect across multiple jobs.
- **Metrics**:
  - Mean delay propagation per breakdown (e.g., average job delay caused by 1hr MILL-02 breakdown).
  - Tardiness delta for jobs affected by “hot job” insertions.
  - Recovery time: time from disruption end to return to baseline queue levels.

*Process mining insight*: Use **deviation analysis** to quantify the cost of disruptions and identify which machines’ breakdowns cause the highest downstream impact.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Based on the above analysis, we identify systemic inefficiencies:

### a. **Bottleneck Identification & Impact**

- **Pathology**: Machines like MILL-03 and HT-01 show 90%+ utilization, queue times 3x longer than other stations, and high correlation with job tardiness.
- **Evidence**: Bottleneck analysis via process mining shows >70% of late jobs experienced >2hr delay at MILL-03. Heatmaps confirm chronic congestion.

### b. **Poor Prioritization Logic**

- **Pathology**: High-priority “hot jobs” (e.g., JOB-7005) are inserted but still experience delays because upstream bottlenecks (CUT-01) aren’t preemptively cleared.
- **Evidence**: Variant analysis shows that 40% of high-priority jobs are still late, primarily due to delays at non-priority-sensitive upstream stations.

### c. **Suboptimal Sequencing & Setup Inflation**

- **Pathology**: No sequencing logic leads to frequent material/size switches on CUT-01, causing setup times to average 25min vs. 8min for similar-job sequences.
- **Evidence**: Setup transition matrix shows that alternating Steel/Aluminum jobs increases setup by 200%. Yet, logs show no batching or sequencing logic applied.

### d. **Downstream Starvation**

- **Pathology**: LATH-02 frequently sits idle despite high utilization upstream, due to unbalanced release or poor WIP management.
- **Evidence**: Resource timeline analysis shows LATH-02 idle 40% of time while MILL-03 queue grows — indicating poor synchronization.

### e. **Bullwhip Effect in WIP**

- **Pathology**: Erratic job releases and reactive scheduling cause WIP to surge at bottleneck stations, then collapse, leading to unstable lead times.
- **Evidence**: WIP tracking over time (via queue entry/exit events) shows high variance and autocorrelation — classic bullwhip signature.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The diagnosed pathologies stem from deeper systemic root causes:

### a. **Static Dispatching Rules in Dynamic Environment**
- FCFS and EDD ignore real-time shop floor status, setup dependencies, and downstream congestion. They are blind to context.

### b. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**
- Schedulers cannot see live queue lengths or machine states, leading to decisions based on stale or incomplete data.

### c. **Inaccurate Duration & Setup Estimation**
- Planned durations are optimistic averages; actuals vary widely (e.g., 60min planned vs. 66.4min actual). Setup times are not modeled at all in scheduling.

### d. **Ignorance of Sequence-Dependent Setups**
- No system exists to group similar jobs or sequence to minimize setups — a major source of hidden capacity loss.

### e. **Poor Inter-Workcenter Coordination**
- Local optimization at each station creates global inefficiency (e.g., Cutting maximizes output, overwhelming Milling).

### f. **Reactive Disruption Handling**
- Breakdowns and hot jobs trigger ad-hoc rescheduling without assessing global impact or recovery paths.

### **Differentiating Scheduling Logic vs. Capacity/Inherent Variability**
Process mining enables this differentiation:
- If utilization is <75% but tardiness is high  **scheduling logic failure** (e.g., poor sequencing, bad prioritization).
- If utilization is >95% and queue times grow linearly with load  **capacity constraint**.
- If task durations show high coefficient of variation (>0.5) even for same job type  **inherent process variability** requiring buffer or robust scheduling.

Example: MILL-03 shows 98% utilization and exponential queue growth — primarily a capacity issue. But setup times vary wildly based on sequence — a scheduling logic failure.

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

We propose three synergistic, data-driven strategies:

---

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Factor Dispatching (DMFD) with Setup-Aware Prioritization**

**Core Logic**: Replace static rules with a real-time scoring function at each work center:

> **Priority Score = w1 * (Due Date Urgency) + w2 * (Downstream Congestion Risk) + w3 * (Setup Time Savings) + w4 * (Job Priority)**

Where:
- *Due Date Urgency* = 1 / (Remaining Time Until Due Date)
- *Downstream Congestion Risk* = Predicted queue time at next 1-2 stations (from historical averages or real-time WIP)
- *Setup Time Savings* = Estimated setup time if this job follows the current one, MINUS average setup time (from transition matrix)
- *Job Priority* = High/Med/Low mapped to numeric weights

Weights (w1-w4) are tuned via process mining regression analysis to maximize on-time delivery.

**Process Mining Inputs**:
- Setup transition matrices per machine.
- Historical correlation between upstream delays and downstream congestion.
- Tardiness prediction models (via decision mining) to weight factors.

**Addresses**:
- Poor prioritization  weights favor urgent/congested paths.
- Setup inflation  rewards sequence-compatible jobs.
- Downstream starvation  penalizes jobs that would overwhelm next station.

**Expected Impact**:
- 25-40% reduction in average tardiness.
- 15% reduction in total setup time.
- Smoother WIP flow.

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Stochastic Scheduling with Digital Twin**

**Core Logic**: Build a **digital twin scheduler** that:
- Uses **historical duration distributions** (mined per job type, operator, machine) instead of fixed estimates.
- Incorporates **predictive breakdown risk** (if maintenance logs exist) or uses historical MTBF to simulate disruption scenarios.
- Runs Monte Carlo simulations for each scheduling decision to estimate probability of on-time completion.

Schedule is generated daily (or triggered by disruptions) to minimize expected tardiness or maximize probability of due date adherence.

**Process Mining Inputs**:
- Duration distributions (mean, std dev, skew) for each task type.
- Breakdown frequency/duration distributions per machine.
- Correlation of operator skill with task duration (if operator data is reliable).

**Addresses**:
- Unpredictable lead times  probabilistic forecasts.
- Disruption vulnerability  schedules include slack or alternative paths.
- Inaccurate planning  uses real historical variability.

**Expected Impact**:
- 30% improvement in lead time predictability (reduced std dev).
- 20% fewer missed due dates under disruption scenarios.
- Better customer quoting accuracy.

---

### **Strategy 3: Setup-Minimizing Dynamic Batching & Sequencing (SMDBS)**

**Core Logic**: At bottleneck machines (identified via process mining), implement:
- **Dynamic job grouping**: Cluster pending jobs by setup attributes (material, size, tooling) using real-time k-means or rule-based grouping.
- **Sequence optimization**: Apply traveling salesman problem (TSP) heuristics to sequence batched jobs to minimize total setup time, using setup transition matrix as cost matrix.
- **Rolling horizon**: Re-optimize sequence every 2-4 hours or after new job arrival.

**Process Mining Inputs**:
- Setup transition cost matrices.
- Real-time job attribute data from MES.
- Historical batch efficiency gains.

**Addresses**:
- Setup time waste  direct minimization via sequencing.
- Bottleneck congestion  increases effective capacity by 10-25%.
- Inefficient resource use  frees up machine time for more jobs.

**Expected Impact**:
- 20-35% reduction in total setup time at key machines.
- 10-15% increase in throughput at bottlenecks.
- Reduced WIP as jobs flow faster through constrained stations.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### a. **Discrete-Event Simulation for Strategy Validation**

We build a **digital twin simulation model** using tools like AnyLogic, Simio, or custom Python/DEVS:

- **Parameters from Process Mining**:
  - Task duration distributions (triangular, lognormal, or empirical).
  - Setup time transition matrices.
  - Machine breakdown MTBF/MTTR distributions.
  - Job arrival patterns and routing probabilities.
  - Initial WIP and resource states.

- **Scenarios to Test**:
  - Baseline (current rules) vs. each proposed strategy.
  - High-load weeks (top 10% busiest periods from logs).
  - High-disruption scenarios (2x breakdown rate, 5x hot jobs).
  - Sensitivity to inaccurate predictions (e.g., ±20% duration error).

- **KPIs Tracked**:
  - Average tardiness, % on-time delivery.
  - Average WIP, max WIP.
  - Resource utilization, setup time %.
  - Makespan, average lead time.

*Outcome*: Select strategy (or hybrid) with best robustness-performance tradeoff.

### b. **Continuous Monitoring & Adaptive Scheduling Framework**

Implement a **closed-loop optimization system**:

1. **Real-Time Process Mining Dashboard**:
   - Live KPI tracking (tardiness, WIP, utilization, setup efficiency).
   - Automatic bottleneck detection (utilization >90% + queue growth).
   - Anomaly detection (e.g., setup time exceeds 95th percentile).

2. **Feedback Loop to Scheduler**:
   - If KPIs degrade (e.g., tardiness increases >15%), trigger re-optimization or weight adjustment in DMFD.
   - If new setup patterns emerge (e.g., new material introduced), update transition matrix monthly.

3. **Monthly Retraining**:
   - Retrain duration/setup prediction models with new log data.
   - Re-run bottleneck and variant analysis quarterly to detect process drift.

4. **A/B Testing in Production**:
   - Roll out new strategies to subsets of machines/jobs.
   - Use causal impact analysis (via process mining) to measure true uplift.

This transforms scheduling from a static, reactive function into a **self-learning, adaptive control system**.
