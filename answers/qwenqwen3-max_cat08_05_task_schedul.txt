# Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategy for Precision Parts Inc.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

To understand the current state of operations at Precision Parts Inc., I would apply a multi-faceted process mining approach to the MES event logs, transforming raw timestamped events into actionable operational intelligence.

### **Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**
- **Process Discovery**: Using algorithms like Inductive Miner or Heuristic Miner on the *case-centric* log (grouped by Job ID), I would reconstruct the *actual* job routing variants—revealing deviations from the nominal process model (e.g., rework loops, skipped inspections, alternate routings due to machine unavailability).
- **Conformance Checking**: Compare actual execution traces against the ideal routing logic to quantify deviations caused by disruptions or ad-hoc decisions.

### **Key Metrics and Techniques**
| **Performance Dimension** | **Process Mining Technique** | **Key Metrics** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Job Flow & Lead Times** | Case Duration Analysis | Distribution of total job lead time, flow time (time from release to completion), cycle time per operation; comparison against due dates |
| **Queue/WIP Analysis** | Waiting Time Extraction | Time between “Queue Entry” and “Task Start” per machine; WIP levels over time per work center; correlation with machine utilization |
| **Resource Utilization** | Resource-Centric Mining | Uptime vs. downtime; productive time vs. setup time vs. idle time per machine/operator; OEE-like metrics derived from logs |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setups** | Pairwise Transition Mining | For each machine, extract all consecutive job pairs (JOB-A  JOB-B); compute average setup duration for each (A,B) pair; build setup time matrix |
| **Tardiness & Adherence** | Due Date Compliance Analysis | % of jobs completed after due date; average/median tardiness; correlation with priority level and job complexity |
| **Disruption Impact** | Event Correlation & Causal Analysis | Time-to-recovery after breakdown; lead time inflation for jobs queued during breakdown; impact of “hot job” insertion on existing schedule (e.g., delay propagation) |

### **Advanced Setup Time Modeling**
To quantify sequence-dependent setups:
- Parse all “Setup Start”  “Setup End” events per machine.
- Link each setup to the *previous job* (via timestamp and machine context) and *current job*.
- Construct a **setup time transition matrix** for each machine:  
  `SetupTime[PrevJobType, CurrJobType] = avg(actual setup duration)`  
  Job types can be defined by material, geometry, or process attributes (e.g., “stainless steel, >5 operations”).
- Use clustering (e.g., k-means on job features) to group similar jobs and reduce matrix sparsity.

This granular setup model becomes critical for predictive sequencing.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Process mining reveals systemic inefficiencies masked by local dispatching rules:

### **Bottleneck Identification**
- **Resource Utilization Heatmaps**: Machines with >85% utilization and high queue lengths (e.g., MILL-02, HT-01) are bottlenecks.
- **WIP Accumulation Analysis**: Persistent WIP buildup before specific machines (e.g., Grinding) indicates downstream starvation or upstream overproduction.
- **Throughput Correlation**: Jobs passing through bottleneck machines show significantly higher lead time variance.

### **Poor Prioritization Evidence**
- **Variant Comparison**: Compare two job cohorts—“On-Time” vs. “Tardy”—using decision tree mining (e.g., *Decision Miner*). Likely findings:
  - High-priority jobs delayed due to FCFS at upstream stations.
  - Near-due-date jobs stuck behind long-duration, low-priority jobs.
- **Priority Inversion Rate**: % of high-priority jobs waiting behind lower-priority ones at queues—likely >40% under current rules.

### **Suboptimal Sequencing & Setup Inflation**
- **Setup Time Benchmarking**: Compare actual total setup time per machine/day against a theoretical minimum (e.g., from solving a Traveling Salesman Problem on job clusters). Likely 25–40% excess setup time due to random sequencing.
- **Setup Clustering Gaps**: Jobs with similar setup requirements (e.g., same material) are frequently interleaved with dissimilar jobs, triggering avoidable long setups.

### **Starvation & Bullwhip Effects**
- **Inter-Operation Time Analysis**: Long idle periods at downstream machines (e.g., Quality Inspection) despite upstream activity indicate poor coordination.
- **WIP Volatility**: High standard deviation in WIP levels over time suggests erratic job releases and lack of pull-based control—classic bullwhip in a push system.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The pathologies stem from fundamental mismatches between scheduling logic and operational reality:

### **Static Rules in a Dynamic System**
- **FCFS/EDD Limitations**: These ignore setup dependencies, downstream load, and real-time disruptions. EDD may prioritize a near-due job that requires a 2-hour setup, while a 10-min job with same due date waits.
- **Local Optimization**: Each work center schedules in isolation, causing global inefficiencies (e.g., upstream overproduction clogs bottleneck).

### **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**
- Dispatchers cannot see:
  - Actual queue composition at other stations.
  - Real-time machine status (e.g., breakdowns logged but not propagated).
  - True remaining processing time (RPT)—planned durations are inaccurate.

### **Inaccurate Time Estimations**
- Process mining reveals:
  - **Planned vs. Actual Duration Bias**: Planned times underestimate by 15–30% on average; variance is high (e.g., CNC Milling: planned 60 min, actual =72, =18).
  - **Setup Time Ignorance**: Scheduling ignores sequence effects—setup treated as fixed or zero.

### **Poor Disruption Response**
- No protocol for “hot job” insertion: urgent jobs preempt queues but cause cascading delays.
- Breakdowns trigger reactive rescheduling (often manual), with no predictive buffer.

### **Differentiating Causes via Process Mining**
- **Capacity vs. Scheduling Issue**: If bottleneck machine utilization is <90% *but* queues are long, the issue is poor sequencing—not capacity.
- **Variability vs. Logic**: High task duration variance (/ > 0.3) suggests inherent process instability; if variance is low but tardiness high, the cause is scheduling logic.

## 4. Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Criteria Dispatching with Setup Awareness**

**Core Logic**: Replace static rules with a **weighted scoring function** applied in real time at each machine queue:

```
Score(Job_i) = w1 * (DueDate - Now) / RPT_i  
               + w2 * Priority_i  
               + w3 * (1 / SetupTime[LastJob, Job_i])  
               + w4 * (1 / DownstreamLoad_i)
```

- **RPT_i**: Remaining processing time (sum of actual historical averages for remaining tasks).
- **SetupTime[LastJob, Job_i]**: From mined setup matrix; penalizes long setups.
- **DownstreamLoad_i**: Estimated WIP or utilization at next machine (from real-time MES data).

**Process Mining Inputs**:
- Historical RPT distributions per job type.
- Setup transition matrix per machine.
- Downstream load correlation from job flow analysis.

**Addresses**:
- Poor prioritization (via due date + priority).
- Excessive setups (via setup-aware scoring).
- Downstream starvation (via load balancing).

**Expected Impact**:
-  Tardiness by 25–40%
-  Total setup time by 20–30%
-  Bottleneck utilization efficiency

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Digital Twin Integration**

**Core Logic**: Build a **probabilistic schedule** using Monte Carlo simulation at job release:
- For each task, sample duration from historical distribution (conditioned on operator, material, complexity).
- Incorporate predicted breakdowns (from historical MTBF/MTTR data).
- Generate *confidence intervals* for job completion time.

**Execution**:
- At each decision point (e.g., job ready for next machine), re-simulate remaining jobs to identify high-risk delays.
- Proactively insert buffers or expedite jobs with >70% risk of missing due date.

**Process Mining Inputs**:
- Task duration distributions (mean, variance, skew) per context.
- Breakdown frequency/duration per machine.
- Rework probability per operation.

**Addresses**:
- Unpredictable lead times (via probabilistic forecasts).
- Reactive disruption handling (via proactive risk mitigation).
- Inaccurate planning (via data-driven time estimates).

**Expected Impact**:
-  Due date reliability (on-time delivery  30%)
-  Emergency expediting
-  Customer trust via accurate ETAs

### **Strategy 3: Setup-Minimizing Batch Sequencing at Bottlenecks**

**Core Logic**: At bottleneck machines (e.g., Heat Treatment), group jobs into **setup-compatible batches** using clustering:
1. Cluster pending jobs by setup similarity (e.g., material, coating, temperature profile).
2. Solve a **Traveling Repairman Problem** (minimizing total setup + processing time) within each cluster.
3. Sequence clusters by urgency (e.g., earliest due date of cluster).

**Implementation**:
- Use a rolling horizon: re-optimize every 4 hours or when new urgent job arrives.
- Allow preemption only for “Critical” priority jobs.

**Process Mining Inputs**:
- Setup similarity matrix from historical pairs.
- Job feature vectors (material, dimensions, operations).
- Bottleneck utilization patterns.

**Addresses**:
- Excessive setup times at critical resources.
- WIP accumulation due to long setups blocking machine.
- Inefficient changeovers.

**Expected Impact**:
-  Bottleneck setup time by 35–50%
-  Throughput by 15–20%
-  WIP before bottleneck

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### **Discrete-Event Simulation for Strategy Validation**
- **Model Construction**: Build a digital twin in AnyLogic or Simio, parameterized with:
  - Task duration distributions (from logs).
  - Setup matrices.
  - Machine breakdown MTBF/MTTR.
  - Job arrival patterns and routing probabilities.
- **Scenarios Tested**:
  - Baseline (current FCFS/EDD mix).
  - Each proposed strategy individually and in combination.
  - Stress tests: 20% higher load, 2x breakdown frequency, 5 urgent jobs/day.
- **KPIs Tracked**:
  - % Tardy jobs, average tardiness.
  - WIP per work center.
  - Bottleneck utilization and setup time.
  - Makespan distribution.

Simulation identifies robust strategies before costly shop-floor trials.

### **Continuous Improvement Framework**
1. **Real-Time KPI Dashboard**: Track tardiness, WIP, setup efficiency daily.
2. **Automated Anomaly Detection**:
   - Use process mining weekly to detect:
     - New routing variants (indicating process drift).
     - Rising setup times (suggesting clustering decay).
     - Bottleneck shifts (due to maintenance or demand changes).
3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Retrain setup matrices and duration models monthly.
   - Adjust dispatching weights (w1–w4) via reinforcement learning based on KPI outcomes.
   - Trigger rescheduling rules when disruption thresholds are exceeded (e.g., >30 min breakdown).

This creates a **self-optimizing scheduling system** that evolves with operational dynamics.
