The main anomalies based on performance and frequency include:

1. **Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection**
   - Frequency: 16
   - Performance: 98,982,000.000

This process has a significantly higher performance time compared to others with similar frequencies or even much lower frequencies.

2. **Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send Appeal to Prefecture**
   - Frequency: 9
   - Performance: 131,155,200.000

This process has a remarkably high performance time relative to its frequency and compared to other processes.

3. **Create Fine -> Payment -> Payment**
   - Frequency: 12
   - Performance: 12,614,400.000

Despite the relatively low performance for two-step payment processing, it is notably different from more complex workflows that could logically be expected to take longer.

These anomalies are primarily due to their significantly high or low performances relative to their frequencies and in comparison to other similar processes.
