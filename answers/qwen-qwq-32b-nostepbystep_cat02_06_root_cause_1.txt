Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided an event log of customer support tickets and want me to identify which cases are taking longer than average, figure out why, and suggest solutions. 

Starting with the first task: identifying cases with longer total resolution times. To do that, I need to calculate the duration for each case from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket". Let me list out each case's start and end times and compute the difference.

Looking at the table:

Case 101:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
- End: 2024-03-01 10:15
That's about 2 hours and 15 minutes. Wait, actually, from 8:00 to 10:15 is 2h15m. Wait, no, the close time is at 10:15 on the same day, so total duration is about 2 hours and 15 minutes. Wait, let me check the exact times again. The first event is at 8:00, and the last is 10:15 on the same day. So that's 2 hours 15 minutes total.

Case 102:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
End: 2024-03-02 09:15. Wait, looking at the log, the Close Ticket is on 03-02 at 09:15. So from March 1 8:05 AM to March 2 9:15 AM. That's over 25 hours? Let me calculate precisely. From March 1 8:05 AM to March 2 8:05 AM is exactly 24 hours, then plus another hour and 10 minutes, so total around 25h10m.

Case 103:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
End: 2024-03-01 09:30. That's just over an hour and 20 minutes. So about 1h20m.

Case 104:
Start: 08:20 on 3/1 to Close on 3/2 08:30. So from March 1 8:20 to March 2 8:30. That's 24h10m plus the extra 10 minutes? Wait, 24 hours would bring it to 8:20 on the next day, so 8:30 would be 24h10m. So total around 24h10m.

Case 105:
Start: 8:25 on 3/1, Close at 3/3 9:30. Wait, looking at the log, the Close Ticket is on 3/03 at 09:30. Wait, the log shows for case 105, the Close is on the 3rd. So from March 1 to March 3, that's two days. Let's compute: From 8:25 AM on the 1st to 9:30 AM on the 3rd. That's two days minus some hours? Let's see: From 8:25 on day 1 to 8:25 on day 3 is 48 hours, but since it ends at 9:30 on day 3, that's 48 + 1h05m = 49h05m? Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let's do it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps converting all times to minutes since a start point would help. Alternatively, just compute the difference between the start and end for each case.

Let me list all durations:

Case 101: 10:15 - 8:00 = 2h15m (total 2.25 hours)
Case 102: End is 3/2 9:15. Start is 3/1 8:05. The difference is (March 2 9:15 - March 1 8:05) = 25 hours 10 minutes (since from 8:05 to 8:05 next day is 24 hours, plus 1h10m more).
Case 103: 9:30 - 8:10 = 1h20m (1.33 hours)
Case 104: 3/2 8:30 - 3/1 8:20 = 24h10m (24.17 hours)
Case 105: 3/3 9:30 - 3/1 8:25 = 2 days minus some time? Let's see: From 3/1 8:25 to 3/3 8:25 would be exactly 48 hours, but since it ends at 9:30, that's 48h + 1h05m = 49h5m. So approximately 49 hours 5 minutes.

Now, to see which are longer than average, first compute the average duration. Let's convert all durations into hours:

Case 101: ~2.25 hours
Case 102: ~25.17 hours
Case 103: ~1.33 hours
Case 104: ~24.17 hours
Case 105: ~49.08 hours (approx 49h)

The average of all cases would be (2.25 + 25.17 + 1.33 +24.17 +49.08)/5. Let me compute that:

Adding up numerators: 2.25+25.17=27.42 +1.33=28.75 +24.17=52.92 +49.08=102.00 total. Divide by 5: 102/5 = 20.4 hours average. 

But the question says "significantly longer than average". The average is about 20 hours. So cases over that would be 102 (25h), 104 (24.17), and 105 (49).08). Wait, but 24.17 is just slightly under 25h, but still above 20. Hmm. The user probably wants the ones that are much longer. The first case is 2.25 hours, which is way below average, so the longer ones are 102,104,105. But maybe the user considers "significantly" as those that are outliers. Comparing to others, 105 is way longer than the rest. Let me check each case's duration again:

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation for case 105. Let me recalculate durations precisely.

Case 101:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
End: 2024-03-01 10:15  2 hours 15 minutes. So 2.25 hours.

Case 102:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
End: 2024-03-02 09:15  that's 25 hours and 10 minutes (since from 8:05 to next day 8:05 is 24h, plus another 1h10m). So total 25.166... hours (since 10 minutes is 1/6 hour, so 25 + 1/6  25.17 hours).

Case 103 is quick: 1h20m (1.33h).

Case 104:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
End: 2024-03-02 08:30  that's 24h10m  24.17 hours.

Case 105:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
End: 2024-03-03 09:30. Let's compute the exact duration. From 3/1 8:25 to 3/3 8:25 is exactly 48 hours. Then add the extra 1h5m (from 8:25 to 9:30 on the 3rd). So total 49h5m, which is 49.08 hours.

Comparing all:

101: ~2.25h
102: ~25.17h
103: ~1.33h
104: ~24.17h
105: ~49.08h

The average would be (2.25 +25.17 +1.33 +24.17 +49.08)/5. Let's add them up:

2.25 +25.17 = 27.42

+1.33  28.75

+24.17  52.92

+49.08  102.00 total. Divided by 5 gives 20.4 hours average.

So cases 102 (25h), 104 (24h), and 105 (49h) are above the average. But to determine "significantly longer", perhaps cases that are outliers. 105 is way longer, so definitely. 102 and 104 are longer than average but maybe close. But the user says "significantly longer than average". So maybe cases 102,104, and especially 105 are the ones.

Now, moving on to the second part: determining the root causes. Need to look into each of the long cases.

Starting with Case 102:

Looking at the log for Case 102:

The activities:

- Receive at 8:05
- Triage at 8:30 (wait time: 25 mins)
- Assign to Level-1 at 9:00 (15 mins later)
- Then next activity is 11:30 (investigate issue? Wait, the log shows after Assign, the next is "Investigate Issue" at 11:30. Wait, looking at the log for 102:

Case 102 activities:

After Assign to Level-1 (9:00), the next is "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" at 11:30? Wait, looking at the table again:

Case 102's events:

After Assign (9:00), the next is "Escalate to Level-2 Agent at 11:30. Wait, is that the next step? Let me check the log:

The log for case 102:

Row 8-12:

102 | 08:05 | Receive

102 | 08:30 | Triage

102 | 09:00 | Assign Level-1

Then next is "Investigate Issue" at 11:30?

Wait, in the table, the next entry after Assign is "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" at 11:30? Wait looking at the actual log:

Looking at the provided table:

For case 102:

Row 8: 08:05 - Receive

Row 9: 08:30 - Triage

Row 10: 09:00 - Assign Level-1

Row 11: 11:30 - Escalate to Level-2

Row 12: 14:00 (2pm) - Investigate Issue

Then Resolve at 3/2 9:00, Close at 9:15.

Wait, so after Assign to Level-1 (9:00), the next step is Escalate to Level-2 at 11:30 (so 2.5 hours later). Then, after escalation, the next activity is Investigate Issue at 14:00 (2 PM), which is 2.5 hours after escalation (from 11:30 to 14:00 is 2.5h). Then, after that, the investigation ends when? Then resolved the next day. Wait let me parse the steps for case 102:

Case 102's timeline:

- Assign to Level-1 at 9:00.

Then, after Assign, there's an Escalate at 11:30. So maybe the agent escalated it to Level-2 after some time.

Then, after escalation, the next step is "Investigate Issue" at 14:00 (2 PM). So between 9 AM and 2 PM, the Escalate took time. But maybe the escalation itself isn't an activity that takes time, but the time between Escalate and the next step? Hmm. Wait, perhaps the escalation is part of the process, but maybe the investigation after escalation takes time.

Wait perhaps the key is to look at the time between each activity step and see where the delays are.

Alternatively, the total duration is the main measure, but the delays between steps matter.

Looking at Case 102's timeline step by step:

- From Assign (9:00) to Escalate (11:30): 2.5 hours. Maybe the agent took time before escalating? But maybe that's part of their investigation step? Not sure. Then after escalation, the next activity is Investigate Issue at 14:00 (2 PM). So between escalation at 11:30 and investigate at 14:00 is 2.5 hours. Then, after investigation, the next is Resolve on the next day (3/2 at 9:00). Wait, the next event after 14:00 investigate is "Resolve Ticket" on 3/2 9:00? Let me check:

Looking at the log for case 102:

After the 14:00 investigation (on 3/1), I assume), the next activity is "Resolve Ticket" on 3/2 9:00, which is the next day. So between 14:00 on 3/1 and 9:00 the next day (3/2) is 22 hours? That's a big gap. Because from 14:00 to 9:00 next day is 21.5 hours. That's a huge delay between investigation and resolution. That's a big gap. So maybe the investigation step was done on 3/1 at 14:00, but then no activity until the next day. That could be a delay.

Similarly, case 105 is the longest. Let's see its steps.

Case 105:

Start: 3/1 8:25

End: 3/3 9:30.

Looking at the log for case 105:

Activities:

After "Investigate Issue" at 9:10 (on 3/1), then Escalate to Level-2 at 10:00 (same day). Then, next activity is "Investigate Issue again at 3/2 14:00 (2 PM). Wait, let me parse:

Case 105's log entries:

Row 23: 3/1 8:25 - Receive

Then Triage at 8:35, Assign at 9:00, investigate at 9:10. Then, escalate at 10:00 (the line says "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" at 10:00 on 3/1. Then the next activity is "Investigate Issue" again at 3/2 14:00. Wait, that's a big gap between escalate and next step.

So between escalate at 10:00 AM on 3/1 and the next investigate step on 3/2 2 PM is 30 hours. That's a long delay. Then after that, investigate to resolve takes some time, but that big gap between escalate and next step is a major delay.

So for each case, the key is to look for long gaps between activities.

So for each case with long duration, let's calculate the time between each step and see where the delays are.

Starting with Case 102:

Case 102's timeline in detail:

- Receive (8:05)  Triage (8:30): 25 mins.

- Triage  Assign (9:00): 30 mins.

- Assign  Escalate (11:30): 2.5 hours (from 9:00 to 11:30 is 2.5h).

Wait, that's the time between assignment to Level-1 and escalation. Maybe the agent took time before escalating, which might be part of investigating? Not sure. But perhaps there's a delay there.

Then Escalate to Level-2 at 11:30  next is Investigate Issue at 14:00 (2 PM): that's 2.5 hours. So between escalate and investigate is 2.5h? Not sure, but then the next step after investigate is Resolve on 3/2 9:00. Wait the Investigate Issue is on 3/1 at 14:00, so the next activity after that is Resolve Ticket on 3/2 9:00 AM. Wait that's a day later. From 14:00 on 3/1 to 9:00 on 3/2 is 22.5 hours? That's a huge gap between investigation and resolution.

Wait, the log shows:

Case 102's log:

After the Investigate Issue at 14:00 (3/1), the next event is Resolve Ticket on 3/2 9:00. So between the investigate and resolve, there's a 22.5 hour gap. That's over 22 hours, which is a major hold-up. That's a big delay. That seems like the main issue.

For Case 104:

Case 104's log:

Activities:

After Assign to Level-1 at 9:30 (on 3/1), then next step is "Investigate Issue at 13:00 (1 PM). So time between assign and investigate is 3.5 hours (9:30 to 13:00 is 3.5h). Then after investigation, the next step is Resolve on 3/2 9:00. So from 13:00 on 3/1 to 9:00 on 3/2 is 20 hours. That's another big gap.

Case 105 has the longest time. Let's look at its steps:

Case 105's timeline:

After the first Investigate (9:10 AM on 3/1), then Escalate to Level-2 at 10:00 AM (same day). Then next Investigate is on 3/2 2 PM (14:00). So from escalate to next investigate is 30 hours (from 10 AM to next day's 14:00 is 28 hours? Wait, let me do this properly.

Case 105's log:

- After escalate (3/1 10:00 AM), next is "Investigate Issue" on 3/2 14:00. So from 10 AM to 2 PM next day (3/2)  that's 28 hours. Then after that, the next steps are Resolve on 3/3 9:00 AM. So between the second investigate and resolve is another day's time? Wait:

Wait, after the second investigate (3/2 14:00), next is Resolve on 3/3 9:00. That's 22.5 hours.

So the big delays are after escalation steps, especially between escalate and next investigate, and between investigations and resolve.

Now, for each case, I need to see which steps are taking too long between activities.

Let me list all steps and their durations between each step for each case.

Starting with Case 101 (short case):

Case 101 steps:

1. Receive (8:00)  Triage (8:10): 10 mins. Good.

2. Triage  Assign (8:20): 10 mins. Quick.

3. Assign  Investigate (9:00): 40 mins.

4. Investigate  Resolve (10:00): 1h.

5. Resolve  Close (10:15): 15 mins. So all steps quick.

Total: 2h15m. Good.

Case 102 (25 hours total):

Steps:

1. Receive (8:05)  Triage (8:30): 25 mins.

2. Triage  Assign (9:00): 30 mins.

3. Assign  Escalate (11:30: 2.5h. So between Assign and escalate took 2.5 hours. Maybe the Level-1 agent took time before escalating.

4. Escalate  Investigate (14:00 (2 PM): 2.5 hours between escalate and investigate? So after escalation, the Level-2 team didn't start investigation until 2.5 hours later?

Wait, the escalate event is at 11:30 AM. Then next is Investigate at 2 PM (14:00). So 2.5 hours between escalate and investigate. Not too bad. But then, after investigation at 2 PM on 3/1, the next step is Resolve on 3/2 9:00 AM. That's a gap of about 20.5 hours (from 14:00 to next day 9:00 AM is 21.5 hours? Let me compute:

From 3/1 14:00 to 3/2 9:00 is 21 hours. That's the main delay here. So between the first investigation and resolve, over 21 hours. That's a big gap. Why?

Case 104 (24h10m):

Steps:

After Assign (9:30 AM), then investigate at 13:00 (3h wait? 9:30 to 13:00 is 3.5 hours. Hmm. Then from investigate (13:00) to Resolve on 3/2 9:00 AM is 24h (from 13:00 to next day 13:00 is 24h, plus 9:00 is 24h minus 4h  20h? Wait. Wait 3/1 13:00 to 3/2 9:00 is 20 hours exactly? Because from 13:00 on day 1 to same time next day is 24h, minus 4 hours (since 9 AM is 4 hours earlier), so total 20 hours? Hmm, perhaps not exact, but over 20 hours.

The big gap here is between the investigation and the resolve step again.

Case 105 (49h):

After escalate to Level-2 at 10:00 AM (3/1), the next investigate is on 3/2 2 PM. So from 10:00 AM to 2 PM next day is 28 hours. That's a long delay between escalate and next step. Then after that, the next steps until resolve:

After 3/2 14:00 (investigate), next step is resolve on 3/3 9:00 AM, which is 25 hours later. So two big gaps.

So in both 102, 104, and 105, the major delays are between the investigation and resolution, or between escalation and next step.

Also, in case 105, after the first investigation at 9:10, they escalate at 10:00, but then next step is 28 hours later. That's a big delay between escalate and next action.

Additionally, some cases have multiple investigation steps? Or maybe the investigation steps are taking too long?

Alternatively, perhaps the escalation process introduces delays. Let's see:

Looking at the activities, sometimes after escalation, there's a long wait before the next action.

So possible root causes could be:

1. Long delays between Escalation and the next action (investigation by Level-2 team?).

2. Delays between investigation and resolution.

Also, perhaps the escalation itself is causing delays because it takes time to escalate, but more importantly, after escalation, the Level-2 team is slow to start work.

Alternatively, maybe the investigation step itself takes too long, but in case 102, the first investigate is done on 3/1 14:00, but then nothing until next day.

Wait, in Case 102, after the first investigation (which is after escalate), the next step is resolve on next day morning. That's a big overnight gap? Maybe the investigation was done, but then the resolution was delayed.

Alternatively, maybe the process requires some steps that are not captured, but in the log, the next activity after investigate is resolve, but the time between them is over 20 hours. So that's a big gap. Maybe the agent is not proceeding to resolve, or there's a hold-up there.

Looking at Case 105:

After escalate (3/1 10:00 AM), next is investigate on 3/2 2 PM. So 28 hours later. That's a massive delay. The Level-2 team might be slow to start.

Similarly, in case 104:

After investigate (3/1 13:00), then resolve on 3/2 9:00. 20h later. That's a big lag.

So, the common issue seems to be that after the investigation step (especially after escalation), there's a long delay before the resolution step. That could be a key issue. Maybe the Level-2 agents are slow to resolve after investigation.

Alternatively, maybe the escalation process itself introduces a delay. Let's see:

Looking at cases with escalations:

Cases 102, 104, and 105 all involve escalation. So perhaps escalations lead to longer delays.

Wait, case 101 didn't escalate and was quick. The short cases (101 and 103) don't escalate, so escalating might be a factor, but not all escalated cases are slow. Case 102 and 104, 105 are the longer ones. Let's see:

Case 102: Escalated  then after escalate, they did investigate (3/1 14:00), but then delay until next day.

Case 105: Escalate  28 hours before next step.

So perhaps the escalation process leads to delays because the Level-2 team is slow to pick up the ticket after escalation. The time between escalate and next action is the main issue.

Additionally, maybe the investigation after escalation isn't started promptly, or the resolution step is delayed.

Another possible issue: the time between Assign and Escalate in 102: 2.5 hours. Maybe the Level-1 agent took too long to escalate, which could be a contributing factor, but that's not as big as the 28h gap in 105.

Now, looking for any other factors. For example, steps like waiting between activities. Let's see in each case.

Case 102:

- After escalate (11:30), next step is investigate at 14:00 (2.5h gap)  not too long. But then between investigate at 14:00 and resolve is 21.5 hours. That's the main delay.

Case 104:

After investigation at 13:00 (3/1), then resolve on 3/2 9:00  24h minus 4h  ~20h.

Case 105:

After escalate (10:00 AM on 3/1, the next investigate is on 3/2 2 PM  28 hours later. That's the big delay. Then after that, another 25h?

Wait, after second investigation (3/2 2 PM), then Resolve on 3/3 9 AM: 25 hours later. So two big gaps.

So the main problem seems to be delays between the escalation and the next action (investigation by Level-2 takes too long, or the investigation to resolution. The big gaps are between the investigation step and resolution. Alternatively, maybe after escalation, the Level-2 team is delayed in starting the investigation. The example of 105 shows that after escalate, 28 hours pass before they start the next step (investigate). So the Level-2 might be slow to start.

Additionally, maybe the process requires some hand-off between teams which isn't happening quickly. For example, when a ticket is escalated, there's a delay in the Level-2 team picking it up. That could be a root cause.

Another possible factor: when a ticket is escalated, the Level-2 team is slow to take action, leading to big gaps between escalate and the next step (investigate). Like in 102, 105, and 104?

Wait, in case 104:

Case 104's log:

After Assign on 3/1 9:30, next is Investigate at 13:00 (3.5h). Not a big deal. Then after investigate, the resolve is 20 hours later. So the issue there is after investigation, the resolver is waiting.

Wait, but in case 102, the investigate is done on 3/1 14:00, but then resolve is next day 9 AM. So the investigation to resolution is a day's delay, but over 20 hours. Maybe the resolver is not working overnight, but maybe they should be handled more promptly.

Alternatively, maybe the investigation step itself takes too long, but in 102, the investigation step is just a timestamp (duration is 0 time, since it's an activity's timestamp, so the time between investigation and resolve is the real issue.

So the key delays are between the investigation and resolution steps, or between escalate and investigate.

So possible causes:

1. Delays in the Level-2 team's response after escalation. For example, in case 105, 28 hours between escalate and next action.

2. Delays in resolving after investigation, especially over night? Maybe the agents are not working overnight, leading to delays overnight, but that's a business hours issue.

Alternatively, maybe the process has steps that require multiple hand-offs, and the hand-off is not efficient.

Alternatively, maybe the investigate step is taking too long because it's not gettingting handled in time, leading to long gaps between those steps.

Another possible issue: For escalated cases, the Level-2 team is backlogged or slow to start work on the tickets, leading to long waits between escalate and their first action.

Additionally, in case 102, the time between escalate and investigation is 2.5h (not too bad), but then the next gap is the big one.

Alternatively, maybe after the investigation step, the resolver is unavailable, leading to long waits before resolve.

Looking for common factors between the long cases:

All three longer cases (102,104,105) are escalated. So escalation is a common factor, but not all escalated cases are slow. Wait, case 102 and 104 and 105 are all escalated. So escalations might be a contributing factor, but not necessarily the only cause.

Wait case 105 is the longest, and it had two investigations? Or maybe after escalate, the investigation takes time.

Also, the presence of multiple investigation steps? Let me see:

Case 102 has one investigate before escalate? Wait no, in case 102's log:

Case 102's steps:

After Assign to Level-1 (9:00 AM), they escalate to Level-2 at 11:30 (so they did some work before escalating?), then the Level-2 team starts investigate at 14:00 (2 PM). So the Level-2's first action after escalation is 2.5 hours later. Then after that, the next steps take time.

So, perhaps the main delays are between steps after escalation: the Level-2 team isn't acting promptly, leading to long gaps between escalate and their first action, and then after investigation, the resolve is slow.

Alternatively, the escalation process itself might require some steps that are slow, or the Level-2 team is overburdened.

Another angle: maybe the process has a required step that's not being done, but the log shows the timestamps.

Also, maybe the "Investigate Issue" step after escalation isn't done quickly, leading to the big gaps between escalate and next steps.

Additionally, in case 105, after escalate, the next step is 28 hours later, which is way too long.

So possible root causes:

- Delays in the Level-2 team addressing escalated tickets, leading to long gaps between escalation and their first action (investigation).

- Inadequate staffing of Level-2 team, causing delays in starting work on escalated tickets.

- Long waiting times between investigation and resolution, possibly due to unavailability of required personnel or resources.

- Lack of follow-up on escalated tickets, leading to them being put on hold for extended periods.

Additionally, in case 105, after the second investigation (3/2 14:00), the next step is resolve on 3/3 9:00  25h later. So even after the second investigation, there's another delay.

Another possible issue: the "Resolve Ticket" step is delayed because it's not being prioritized, or requires approval steps not shown in the log, or staff is not available.

Alternatively, the process after escalation has a bottleneck in the Level-2 team's capacity.

Another factor: some cases might have multiple investigations, but in the log, each investigation is a single step. Maybe the need to escalate and then re-investigate adds time, but the main problem is the time between steps after escalation.

So to summarize the root causes:

1. **Delays in Level-2 team response**: The time between escalation and when the Level-2 team starts working on the ticket (e.g., in Case 105, 28 hours between escalate and next action).

2. **Long gaps between investigation and resolution**: In cases 102 and 104, after investigation, the ticket sits for over 20 hours before being resolved.

3. **Overnight delays**: If the investigation is done late in the day, the resolver might not work overnight, leading to next-day processing, but that's just business hours. However, 20 hours is more than a day's work hours (assuming 8 hours a day? So 20h is 2.5 days? Not sure, but the system might have business hours considered. But the log shows the time as 22 hours, which is over a day.

Possible recommendations:

- Ensure that escalated tickets are prioritized and Level-2 team has sufficient capacity to handle them promptly.

- Streamline the escalation process to reduce delays between escalation and the Level-2 team's first action.

- Implement follow-up reminders or SLAs for escalated tickets to ensure timely action.

- Investigate why there's a long delay between investigation and resolution. Maybe the resolution step requires additional steps or approvals that are not captured in the log, but the process has a bottleneck there.

Additionally, looking at the time between each activity for all cases.

Another point: in Case 104, after the initial investigation (3/1 13:00), the next step is resolve on 3/2 9:00 (20h later). That's the main delay.

So the common issue across the slow cases is the delay between investigation and resolution, especially when escalated. Or the delay between escalate and investigate.

Alternatively, maybe the process has a step missing, like a hand-off between Level-1 and Level-2 that's not being tracked, but the main problem is the time between activities.

So, the root causes are likely:

- Delays in the Level-2 team's response time after receiving an escalated ticket (e.g., 28 hours in case 105).

- Long delays between
