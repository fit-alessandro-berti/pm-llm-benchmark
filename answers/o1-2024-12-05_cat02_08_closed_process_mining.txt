Below are proposals for opposite and more general concepts for each given process mining-related term. The "opposite concept" provides a contrast in how the activity is approached, while the "more general concept" expands the scope beyond the specialized notion into a broader category.

1. **Automated Process Discovery**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** **Manual Process Modeling**  
     Instead of algorithmically mining event logs to generate process models, the process is manually constructed based on interviews, expert knowledge, and documentation, with no automated algorithms involved.  
   - **More General Concept:** **Process Modeling**  
     Encompasses any method of representing and formalizing business processes, whether automated discovery, semi-automated techniques, or purely manual approaches.

2. **Predictive Monitoring**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** **Retrospective Process Analysis**  
     Instead of using models to predict future process states or outcomes, this focuses solely on understanding and interpreting past process behavior after it has fully executed, without forecasting what will happen next.  
   - **More General Concept:** **Process Monitoring and Analysis**  
     Covers all approaches to examining process behavior, including predictive, real-time, and retrospective analysis to enhance decision-making and performance.

3. **Bottom-up Discovery**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** **Top-down Design**  
     Rather than starting with raw event data and building up a process model, top-down design begins with a high-level conceptual model or framework and then refines it, potentially verifying details with specific data and instances.  
   - **More General Concept:** **Process Identification**  
     Any method to recognize or define what a process is and how it operates, ranging from data-driven discovery at the bottom level to high-level conceptual frameworks.

4. **Process Simulation**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** **Actual Process Execution**  
     Simulation involves modeling hypothetical or future scenarios in a controlled environment, while actual execution deals with the real running of processes in production settings without simulated assumptions.  
   - **More General Concept:** **Process Analysis and Experimentation**  
     Includes a broad range of techniques (simulation, sandbox testing, pilot runs, what-if analysis) to understand and improve process performance before, during, and after implementation.

5. **Process Efficiency**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** **Process Inefficiency or Waste**  
     Instead of focusing on minimizing resource consumption and cycle times, this concept focuses on aspects of the process that cause delays, errors, or unnecessary cost.  
   - **More General Concept:** **Process Performance**  
     Embraces various metrics and aspects such as efficiency, effectiveness, quality, compliance, and flexibility, offering a holistic view of how well a process meets its objectives.

6. **Real-time Monitoring**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** **Batch or Offline Analysis**  
     Contrary to continuously tracking and reacting to events as they occur, offline analysis involves reviewing data in scheduled batches or after-the-fact, without immediate feedback loops.  
   - **More General Concept:** **Process Performance Management**  
     Covers all strategies and techniques for ensuring processes meet targets, including real-time dashboards, periodic reports, alerts, and retrospective evaluations.
