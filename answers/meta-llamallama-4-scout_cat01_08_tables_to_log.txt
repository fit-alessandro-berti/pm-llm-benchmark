## Event Log for Process Mining
To create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining, we will integrate data from the provided tables: Orders, Order Lines, Deliveries, Invoices, and Payments. We will ensure that the event log contains a unique identifier for each process instance (Case ID), a descriptive name for each activity (Activity Name), a timestamp for when the event occurred, and optionally, the resource or actor responsible for the event.

### Step 1: Identify Cases and Derive Activities
- **Case ID**: Use `order_id` as the unique identifier for each process instance.
- **Activities**: Derive events from key steps in the lifecycle of each order.

### Step 2: Map Timestamps and Combine Data
Ensure chronological order reflects the real process flow. Each event should have a timestamp and can be linked using keys provided.

### Step 3: Enrich with Resources and Attributes
Include a "Resource" or "Actor" column if available.

## Detailed Explanation

### Orders and Order Lines
- **Order Created**: Directly from the `Orders` table.
- **Items Picked**: From the `Order Lines` table, one event per item picked.

### Deliveries
- **Order Dispatched**: From the `Delivery` table, dispatch date.
- **Order Arrived**: From the `Delivery` table, arrival date.

### Invoices and Payments
- **Invoice Issued**: From the `Invoice` table.
- **Payment Received**: From the `Payments` table.

### Assumptions
- For simplicity, if an order or activity does not have a specific resource or actor mentioned, it is left blank or inferred from context.
- Every event for every `order_id` is included.
