### **Labeled Activities and Rationale**

After analyzing the event log, the data reveals distinct phases corresponding to different manufacturing activities. Below are the labeled activities, grouped by patterns in sensor readings, along with the rationale for each label:

---

#### **1. Idle/Setup (Events 1–3, 13–15)**  
**Rationale**:  
- **Sensor Readings**: All parameters (temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, energy) are at baseline or minimal levels.  
- **Pattern**: No activity is occurring. The machine is likely in a dormant state, waiting for a process to begin.  
- **Why Label**: This phase represents preparation or rest, common before an operation starts.

---

#### **2. Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)**  
**Rationale**:  
- **Sensor Readings**:  
  - **Temperature**: Rises sharply (50°C  58°C).  
  - **Vibration**: Increases significantly (30 Hz  38 Hz).  
  - **Pressure**: Rises (1 bar  1.5 bar).  
  - **Material Flow**: Stabilizes at 5 units/s.  
  - **Tool Position**: Moves from 5 mm to 10 mm.  
- **Pattern**: High energy consumption (2.00–3.00 kWh) and dynamic tool movement suggest active cutting.  
- **Why Label**: Cutting operations typically generate heat, vibration, and require tool movement, aligning with these readings.

#### **3. Pressing/Adjusting (Events 7–8)**  
**Rationale**:  
- **Sensor Readings**:  
  - **Temperature**: Drops to 40°C.  
  - **Pressure**: Increases to 2 bar.  
  - **Vibration**: Decreases to 10 Hz.  
  - **Material Flow**: Drops to 2 units/s.  
  - **Tool Position**: Stabilizes at 15 mm.  
- **Pattern**: High pressure with moderate vibration and energy consumption.  
- **Why Label**: This phase likely involves pressing or adjusting parts, where pressure is applied without significant vibration or material flow.

#### **4. Welding (Event 9)**  
**Rationale**:  
- **Sensor Readings**:  
  - **Temperature**: Spikes to 80°C.  
  - **Vibration**: Increases sharply to 50 Hz.  
  - **Material Flow**: Drops to 0 (no material movement).  
  - **Energy**: Peaks at 5.00 kWh.  
  - **Tool Position**: Remains at 15 mm.  
- **Pattern**: Extremely high energy and heat, with no material flow, indicating a focused, high-energy process.  
- **Why Label**: Welding requires intense heat and energy to join materials, matching these parameters.

---

#### **5. Cooling/Resting (Event 10)**  
**Rationale**:  
- **Sensor Readings**:  
  - **Temperature**: Drops to 30°C.  
  - **Vibration**: Returns to 1 Hz.  
  - **Pressure**: Drops to 1 bar.  
  - **Material Flow**: 0.  
- **Pattern**: A temporary pause after welding, allowing the machine to cool down.  
- **Why Label**: This phase likely represents a cooldown period to prevent overheating or prepare for the next step.

---

#### **6. Assembling Parts (Events 11–13)**  
**Rationale**:  
- **Sensor Readings**:  
  - **Temperature**: Returns to 20–25°C.  
  - **Vibration**: Low (0–5 Hz).  
  - **Material Flow**: Stabilizes at 1 unit/s.  
  - **Tool Position**: Moves from 15 mm to 20 mm.  
  - **Energy**: Moderate (1.50–1.60 kWh).  
- **Pattern**: Stable conditions with controlled tool movement, suggesting assembly.  
- **Why Label**: Assembling involves precise positioning of parts with minimal vibration and energy, fitting this phase.

### **Key Observations**
- **Energy Consumption**: Welding (5.00 kWh) is the most energy-intensive, followed by cutting (2.00–3.00 kWh), pressing (2.00 kWh), and assembling (1.50–1.60 kWh).  
- **Tool Position**: Reflects the machine’s active role in cutting (5–10 mm), welding (15 mm), and assembling (20 mm).  
- **Transitions**: The log shows clear transitions between phases, such as from cutting to pressing, then to welding, and finally to assembling, suggesting a structured manufacturing workflow.  

This analysis demonstrates how process mining can infer high-level activities from raw sensor data, even without explicit labels.
