1. Sink Place: The opposite concept to Source Place is a Sink Place. In Petri nets, a Source Place is a place that has an incoming transition without any outgoing transitions, meaning tokens can only enter but not leave. On the other hand, a Sink Place has no incoming transitions but has at least one outgoing transition, meaning tokens can only leave but not enter.

2. Delayed Transition: A more general concept to Immediate Transition is Delayed Transition. An Immediate Transition consumes tokens from its input places as soon as they become available and produces tokens into its output places immediately. In contrast, a Delayed Transition consumes tokens but does not produce tokens immediately. It introduces a delay between the consumption and production of tokens, which can be modeled using timed Petri nets or by adding places and transitions to represent the delay.

3. Enablement Transition: A more general concept to Live Transition is Enablement Transition. A Live Transition is a transition that can fire as soon as its preconditions (i.e., the marks on its input places) are satisfied. An Enablement Transition, however, is a more general concept that allows for additional conditions to be satisfied before it can fire. For example, an Enablement Transition may require a specific sequence of token movements or the presence of a special token in a specific place.

4. Unbounded Net: The opposite concept to Bounded Net is an Unbounded Net. A Bounded Net is a Petri net in which the number of tokens in each place is bounded. In contrast, an Unbounded Net does not have such restrictions, allowing an arbitrary number of tokens to be present in any place.

5. Conflict Net: A more general concept to Free Choice Net is Conflict Net. A Free Choice Net is a Petri net in which each transition is enabled by exactly one of its input places. In other words, choosing the next transition to fire is a matter of choice (i.e., free choice). However, a Conflict Net allows for more complex situations where multiple transitions can be enabled simultaneously, introducing a conflict that needs to be resolved before the next transition can fire. This can be modeled using the concept of priority, where certain transitions have higher priority than others, or by using mutual exclusion, where only one of a set of transitions can fire at a time.
