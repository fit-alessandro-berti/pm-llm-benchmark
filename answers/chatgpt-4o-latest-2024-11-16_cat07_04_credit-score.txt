The diagram provided is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) flowchart**. It represents a process flow involving a **credit scoring service** and a **credit scoring frontend (bank)**. Below is a description of how different parts of the visualization interrelate:

### Structural Breakdown of the Diagram

1. **Swimlanes**: 
   - **Credit Scoring Frontend (Bank):** The top lane represents actions taken by the bank's frontend.
   - **Scoring Service:** The bottom lane represents processes handled by a scoring service.
   - These swimlanes visually distinguish the participants in the process and their respective responsibilities.

### Process Flow

#### 1. **Scoring Request Initiation**:
   - **Start Event**: In both lanes, the process begins with a "scoring request received" event, shown as an envelope symbol.
   
   - **Bank (Credit Scoring Frontend)**: After receiving the request, the bank system sends a request for a credit score. The process then hands over the flow to the scoring service.
   
   - **Scoring Service**: After receiving the request, the scoring service starts computing the credit score in **Level 1** processing.

#### 2. **Score Availability Check**: 
   - The scoring service checks if the credit score is immediately available.
   
   - **Gateway Decision** ("X" sign): If a score is available (yes), the process proceeds to send the credit score. If not (no), the service reports a delay.

#### 3. **Reporting Delay**:
   - When the score is unavailable at Level 1, a delay is reported, prompting the process to move into **Level 2** credit score computation.
   
   - While the scoring runs at Level 2, an ID is included in the message queueing for further processes.

#### 4. **Send Credit Score**:
   - After the score is successfully computed:
     - The **Scoring Service** sends the credit score to the bank (frontend), shown as the "send credit score" task.
     - The **Bank Frontend** system receives and processes the score.
   
   - Depending on availability, the service can send the score either after level 1 or level 2 computation.

#### 5. **Handling the Score**:
   - Once the score is received and processed, the bank proceeds to handle the scoring request, which concludes the process with an **end event** (circle with a bold border).

#### Loopback (Delay Information):
   - There is a path from the bank that deals with delays in receiving the credit score. If delay information is received, the system continues to wait for the score until it is eventually processed.

### Key BPMN Elements:

- **Start and End Events**: Represented by circles (start is plain, end has bold borders).
- **Tasks**: Boxes labeled, such as "request credit score," "compute credit score," "send credit score."
- **Message Flow**: Dotted lines with envelopes, signifying communication between systems.
- **Gateways**: Diamonds with "X" indicating decision points, like determining score availability.
- **Swimlanes**: Representing different organizational units or systems involved in the process.

### Conclusion
The diagram outlines a **credit scoring process** where a scoring request is received by the bank's frontend and forwarded to a scoring service. The service checks if the credit score is available or not. If not available, it reports delays and processes two levels of score computations. The score is eventually sent back to the bank, where the request is resolved.
