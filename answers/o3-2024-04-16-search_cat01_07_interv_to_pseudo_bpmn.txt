BPMN-like Textual Process Model  
Process Name: “Invoice Approval & Payment Scheduling”


1. PARTICIPANTS (Pools / Lanes)  
   • External Supplier (message-only)  
   • Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)  
   • Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor)  
   • Purchasing Officer  
   • Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)  
   • Department Manager  
   • Accounting System / Workflow Engine

2. DATA / ARTIFACTS  
   • Invoice (doc)  
   • Purchase Order (PO) (doc)  
   • “Receipt-of-Goods” confirmation (data)  
   • Discrepancy log / email thread (data)  
   • Payment Run Batch (data)

3. MAIN SEQUENCE FLOW (Happy Path)  

(External Supplier  AP Clerk)  
S0  Start Event “Invoice received by e-mail”

(AP Clerk)  
A1  Task “Check invoice for valid PO number”  
G1  Exclusive Gateway “PO present?”  
• No-PO  B1  
• Yes-PO  A2  

B1  Task “Request PO / corrected invoice from Supplier” (message to Supplier)  
   Intermediate Event “Corrected invoice received”  loop back to S0  

A2  Task “Log invoice in Accounting System” (creates Invoice record)  
A3  Task “Forward invoice to Purchasing for receipt confirmation” (message)  

(Purchasing Officer)  
P1  Task “Verify goods/services received & compare invoice vs PO”  
G2  Exclusive Gateway “Discrepancy at this point?”  
• Yes  P2  
• No  P3  

P2  Task “Hold invoice / contact Supplier or instruct AP Clerk to hold”  Intermediate Event “Corrected invoice or clarification received”  loop back to P1  

P3  Task “Send confirmation of receipt & match” (message to AP Clerk)  

(AP Clerk)  
A4  Task “Match invoice line items against PO in system”  
G3  Exclusive Gateway “Matching successful?”  
• No  A5  
• Yes  A6  

A5  Task “Seek clarification from Purchasing”  
Intermediate Event “Still unresolved?”  
• If YES  Escalation Event  lane AP Supervisor (see E-Flow-1)  
• If NO (clarified)  loop back to A4  

A6  Task “Trigger Manager approval request” (system auto-email)

(Department Manager)  
M1  Task “Review invoice & PO”  
G4  Exclusive Gateway “Approve?”  
• Reject/Hold  M2  
• Approve  M3  

M2  Task “Reject or request investigation” (message to AP Clerk)  
   loop back to A4 or A5 depending on issue  

M3  Task “Approve in system” (token returns to AP Clerk)  

(AP Clerk)  
A7  Task “Schedule invoice for next payment run” (updates Payment Run Batch)  
E0  End Event “Invoice queued for payment”

4. EXCEPTION & VARIATION FLOWS  

E-Flow-1  (AP Supervisor & SRM involvement)  
• Trigger: Escalation from A5 when invoice/PO mismatch can’t be resolved quickly.  
• AP Supervisor Task S1 “Investigate discrepancy; may contact Supplier or create retrospective PO for informal services.”  
• Optional parallel message to SRM Task SR1 “Validate contract terms / obtain corrected pricing or PO.”  
• Gateway S-G1 “Issue resolved?”  
– YES  return token to A4 (matching step).  
– NO  S2 Task “Reject invoice”  Terminate End “Invoice closed as rejected”.

E-Flow-2  (Manager rejection)  
• If Department Manager rejects (M2) and subsequent investigation still fails, AP Clerk or AP Supervisor can terminate the process with a “Rejected Invoice” End Event.

E-Flow-3  (No-PO services)  
• If invoice is for informally contracted services (identified at G1 or later), AP Supervisor coordinates retrospective PO creation (S1) before normal flow resumes at A2/A4.


5. GATEWAY CONDITIONS (for diagram labels)  
G1: PO present?Yes = has PO reference; No = missing PO  
G2: Discrepancy?Quantity, price, or delivery mismatch found  
G3: Matching successful?Line-item & value alignment in system  
G4: Manager approval?Approve / Reject / Hold  
S-G1: Issue resolved?Root cause fixed & documentation complete  


6. MESSAGE / DATA FLOWS (non-sequence)  
• E-mail from Supplier  AP Clerk (Invoice)  
• E-mail AP Clerk  Supplier (PO request or corrected invoice)  
• System notification AP Clerk  Purchasing (A3)  
• Confirmation message Purchasing  AP Clerk (P3)  
• System notification AP Clerk  Department Manager (A6)  
• Approval/Rejection message Department Manager  AP Clerk (M2/M3)  
• Escalation message AP Clerk  AP Supervisor (A5)  
• Contract/pricing query AP Supervisor  SRM (S1/SR1)  
• Payment batch sent from Accounting System to Bank interface (post-process, not detailed in interviews)


7. NOTES / AMBIGUITIES  
• Interviewees differed slightly on whether Purchasing or AP Clerk first detects mismatches; model assumes Purchasing does initial “goods received” check (P1) and AP Clerk performs final system match (A4).  
• Frequency of Manager rejection is “once every couple of months”; path modeled but occurrence probability not shown.  
• The exact mechanics of the “payment run” (A7) were not described; only that invoices are queued after approval.  
• Some services lack an initial PO; the retrospective-PO activity (S1) has been added though timing can vary.  
• Escalation hierarchy beyond AP Supervisor (e.g., Finance Director) was not mentioned and is therefore omitted.
