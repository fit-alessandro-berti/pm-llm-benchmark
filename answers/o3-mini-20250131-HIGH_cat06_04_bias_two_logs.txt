The two logs reveal a systematic difference in how applicants are treated based on attributes related to local residency and community group membership. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison and analysis:

### **Group A (Protected Group)**
- **Attributes:**
  - **LocalResident:** All entries are marked as **FALSE**.
  - **CommunityGroup:** All entries are **None**.
- **Score Adjustments:**
  - The **ScoreAdjustment** column is consistently **0**.
  - There is no indication of any bonus or modification to the base **PreliminaryScore**.
- **Outcome:**
  - Final decisions are made solely on the initial credit scores (e.g., 720, 710, 740) without any additional benefit.
  - For example, an applicant with a score of 710 was rejected, and no mechanism exists to offset a borderline score.

### **Group B (Unprotected Group)**
- **Attributes:**
  - **LocalResident:** All entries are marked as **TRUE**.
  - **CommunityGroup:** Some applicants belong to the **Highland Civic Darts Club**, while others do not.
- **Score Adjustments:**
  - Applicants who are local residents and are associated with a community group (e.g., U001 and U003) receive a **+10 (Community Boost)** during the scoring process.
  - This boost is applied at multiple stages (PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, and FinalDecision), effectively increasing their score.
  - For instance:
    - **U001:** Starts with a 720, gets a +10 boost to become 730, and is then approved.
    - **U003:** Begins with 695, is boosted to 705, and is ultimately approved.
  - Conversely, applicants without the community affiliation (e.g., U002) do not receive any boost, and their outcomes reflect only their base score.

### **Manifestation of Bias**
- **Systematic Advantage:**
  - The unprotected group benefits from a systematic **score adjustment bonus** that is tied directly to being a local resident and/or belonging to a specific community group.
  - This bonus means that even if an applicant's base score is similar to that of a protected group member, the unprotected applicant is more likely to achieve a score that meets or exceeds the approval threshold.
- **Disadvantage for Protected Group:**
  - Members of the protected group, despite potentially having similar or even higher base scores, receive **no such boost** because they are not local residents and are not members of the community group that triggers the bonus.
  - As a result, they are evaluated solely on their preliminary scores without any mitigating adjustments, which may lead to a higher likelihood of rejection.

### **Conclusion**
The event log for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits bias. The bias manifests through the **ScoreAdjustment** mechanism, where being a local resident and a member of a particular community group (e.g., Highland Civic Darts Club) results in a **+10 score boost**. This preferential treatment systematically advantages unprotected applicants, leading to higher overall scores and more favorable final decisions compared to the protected group (Group A), who do not receive any such benefit. Such a disparity in treatment can result in systematic differences in approval rates, even when the initial creditworthiness (as measured by the preliminary scores) might be similar between the groups.
