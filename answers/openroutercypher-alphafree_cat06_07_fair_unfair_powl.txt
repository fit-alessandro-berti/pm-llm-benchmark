Here are the two POWL models based on the description you provided:

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:

In this model, there is an XOR branching after the skill assessment, where one branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation and the other to a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" activity, which introduces potential bias by giving an advantage based on local community affiliation.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Process Steps as Nodes
ReceiveApplication = Transition('ReceiveApplication')
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition('DataCompletenessCheck')
RequestMoreInfo = Transition('RequestMoreInfo')
SkillAssessment = Transition('SkillAssessment')
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition('CommunityAffiliationCheck')
CulturalFitCheck = Transition('CulturalFitCheck')
ManagerialReview = Transition('ManagerialReview')
FinalDecision = Transition('FinalDecision')

# Loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
# XOR Branching (Potential Unfairness)
xor_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])
# Construct the full workflow (including potential unfairness)
workflow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor_choice, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the execution order (partial order)
workflow.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
workflow.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
workflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_choice)
workflow.order.add_edge(xor_choice, ManagerialReview)
workflow.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Visualization
pm4py.view_powl(workflow)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness:

This model eliminates the XOR branching based on community affiliation. All applicants will only undergo a standard cultural fit evaluation, ensuring a fair assessment.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Process Steps as Nodes
ReceiveApplication = Transition('ReceiveApplication')
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition('DataCompletenessCheck')
RequestMoreInfo = Transition('RequestMoreInfo')
SkillAssessment = Transition('SkillAssessment')
CulturalFitCheck = Transition('CulturalFitCheck')
ManagerialReview = Transition('ManagerialReview')
FinalDecision = Transition('FinalDecision')

# Loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
# Construct the full workflow (without potential unfairness)
workflow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the execution order (partial order)
workflow.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
workflow.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
workflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
workflow.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
workflow.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Visualization
pm4py.view_powl(workflow)
```

These models use the Partial Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) to structure and visualize the hiring process, highlighting where unfair bias can occur.
