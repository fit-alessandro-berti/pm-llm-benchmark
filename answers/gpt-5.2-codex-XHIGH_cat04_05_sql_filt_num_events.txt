Here is a simple DuckDB SQL query that keeps only cases with **six or fewer events**, returning all events from those cases:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS c
USING (case_id)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**
- The subquery counts events per `case_id` and keeps only those with `COUNT(*) <= 6`.
- The outer query joins those qualifying case IDs back to the original table to return all events from valid cases.

This fulfills the requirement: any case with more than six events is excluded entirely.
