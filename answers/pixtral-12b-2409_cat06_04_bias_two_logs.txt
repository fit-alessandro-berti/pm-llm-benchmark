To determine which log exhibits bias, we need to analyze the influence of the `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` attributes and the `ScoreAdjustment` column on the final decisions in both Group A and Group B.

### Group A (Protected Group)

1. **LocalResident Attribute**: All entries in Group A have `LocalResident` set to `FALSE`.
2. **CommunityGroup Attribute**: All entries in Group A have `CommunityGroup` set to `None`.
3. **ScoreAdjustment Column**: All entries in Group A have `ScoreAdjustment` set to `0`.

### Group B (Unprotected Group)

1. **LocalResident Attribute**: Entries in Group B have `LocalResident` set to `TRUE`.
2. **CommunityGroup Attribute**: Some entries in Group B have `CommunityGroup` set to `Highland Civic Darts Club` and others to `None`.
3. **ScoreAdjustment Column**: Entries in Group B have `ScoreAdjustment` values of `+10 (Community Boost)` when `CommunityGroup` is `Highland Civic Darts Club`.

### Analysis of Bias

#### Group A (Protected Group)
- **Consistency**: All entries are treated uniformly with no adjustments based on `LocalResident` or `CommunityGroup`.
- **Final Decisions**: Decisions are based solely on the `PreliminaryScore` and `ScoreAdjustment` (which is zero for all entries).
- **Outcome**: The decisions are consistent and unbiased based on the given attributes.

#### Group B (Unprotected Group)
- **Influence of CommunityGroup**: Entries with `CommunityGroup` as `Highland Civic Darts Club` receive a `ScoreAdjustment` of `+10`, which can significantly impact the final score.
- **Final Decisions**: The final decisions are influenced by the `ScoreAdjustment` due to the `CommunityGroup` attribute.
- **Outcome**: The decisions are biased in favor of members of the `Highland Civic Darts Club`.

### Manifestation of Bias
- **Group B** exhibits bias because the `CommunityGroup` attribute influences the `ScoreAdjustment`, which in turn affects the final decision. This is evident in cases `U001` and `U003`, where the `Community Boost` of `+10` leads to approval despite lower preliminary scores.
- **Group A** does not exhibit bias because there is no adjustment based on `LocalResident` or `CommunityGroup`.

### Systematic Differences in Final Decisions
- **Group A**: Decisions are consistent and based solely on the preliminary score.
- **Group B**: Decisions are influenced by the `CommunityGroup` attribute, leading to a systematic bias in favor of members of the `Highland Civic Darts Club`.

### Conclusion
Group B exhibits bias due to the influence of the `CommunityGroup` attribute on the `ScoreAdjustment`, leading to systematic differences in final decisions. Group A does not exhibit such bias, as decisions are consistent and not influenced by `LocalResident` or `CommunityGroup` attributes.
