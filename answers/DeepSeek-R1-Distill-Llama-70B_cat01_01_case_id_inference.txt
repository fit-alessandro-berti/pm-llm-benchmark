Okay, I need to figure out how to group these hospital process events into separate cases. Since there's no explicit case ID, I have to infer them based on the attributes provided. Let me go through each event step by step and try to group them logically.

First, I'll list out all the events with their details to get a clearer picture.

1. **Event 1:** Register patient, ER, 45, M, private insurance.
2. **Event 2:** Register patient, ER, 62, F, public insurance.
3. **Event 3:** Register patient, Surgery, 28, M, private insurance.
4. **Event 4:** Initial triage, ER, 45, M, triage code 3.
5. **Event 5:** Initial triage, ER, 62, F, triage code 2.
6. **Event 6:** Doctor consultation, Surgery, 28, M, scheduled knee surgery.
7. **Event 7:** X-ray imaging, Radiology, 45, M, left leg.
8. **Event 8:** Lab test requested, ER, 62, F, blood panel.
9. **Event 9:** Surgery preparation, Surgery, 28, M, general anesthesia.
10. **Event 10:** Lab test completed, Lab, 62, F, normal levels.
11. **Event 11:** Doctor consultation, ER, 62, F, minor infection.
12. **Event 12:** Doctor consultation, ER, 45, M, hairline fracture.
13. **Event 13:** Surgery performed, Surgery, 28, M, arthroscopy.
14. **Event 14:** Prescription created, ER, 62, F, antibiotics.
15. **Event 15:** Patient discharged, ER, 45, M, outpatient followup.
16. **Event 16:** Recovery room, Surgery, 28, M, stable.
17. **Event 17:** Patient discharged, ER, 62, F, pharmacy pickup.
18. **Event 18:** Patient discharged, Surgery, 28, M, physiotherapy sessions.

Now, I'll try to see which events belong together by looking at patient_age, gender, department, and activity sequence.

Starting with Event 1: Registration in ER for a 45-year-old male. Next, Event 4 is triage for the same age and gender in ER. Then Event 7 is an X-ray, Event 12 is a doctor consultation, and Event 15 is discharge. All these are in ER and match the 45 M. So these events (1,4,7,12,15) form one case.

Event 2 is registration for 62 F in ER. Event 5 is triage, Event 8 is lab request, Event 10 is lab completion, Event 11 is consultation, Event 14 is prescription, and Event 17 is discharge. These all match 62 F in ER, so they form another case (2,5,8,10,11,14,17).

Event 3 is registration in Surgery for 28 M. Event 6 is consultation, Event 9 is prep, Event 13 is surgery, Event 16 is recovery, and Event 18 is discharge. All in Surgery with 28 M, so they form the third case (3,6,9,13,16,18).

I think that's it. Each case is grouped based on consistent age, gender, and department, with activities following a logical sequence from registration through discharge.

To group the events into separate cases, we analyze the attributes such as patient_age, patient_gender, department, and the logical sequence of activities. Here is the inferred case grouping:

---

### Case 1
- **Patient:** 45 years old, Male
- **Department:** ER
- **Events:**
  1. Register patient
  4. Initial triage
  7. X-ray imaging
  12. Doctor consultation
  15. Patient discharged

---

### Case 2
- **Patient:** 62 years old, Female
- **Department:** ER
- **Events:**
  2. Register patient
  5. Initial triage
  8. Lab test requested
  10. Lab test completed
  11. Doctor consultation
  14. Prescription created
  17. Patient discharged

---

### Case 3
- **Patient:** 28 years old, Male
- **Department:** Surgery
- **Events:**
  3. Register patient
  6. Doctor consultation
  9. Surgery preparation
  13. Surgery performed
  16. Recovery room
  18. Patient discharged

---

Each case is grouped based on the consistency of patient_age, patient_gender, and department, as well as the logical progression of activities from registration to discharge.
