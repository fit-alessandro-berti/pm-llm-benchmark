1. What assumptions about customer preferences and competitive positioning are made during market research, and how are those assumptions validated before committing to the prototype design?

2. How does the organization decide which features belong in the initial prototype versus being deferred, and what governance prevents scope creep while still allowing innovation?

3. Why is component sourcing structured as fully parallel activities, and what coordination mechanisms ensure cross-supplier compatibility (mechanical tolerances, firmware, standards) without delaying the critical path?

4. How are suppliers in different countries evaluated beyond cost—e.g., geopolitical exposure, IP protection, ESG compliance, lead-time reliability—and how often is that evaluation refreshed?

5. What single points of failure exist in the component supply network (e.g., a sole-source chip), and what dual-sourcing or substitution strategies are realistically feasible without redesign?

6. How is demand uncertainty translated into component order quantities and safety stocks, especially for long-lead items like OLED panels and advanced microprocessors?

7. What triggers the decision to ship all components to Malaysia only after “all components secured,” and could partial shipments or kitting strategies reduce assembly downtime?

8. How are logistics risks (port congestion, air capacity constraints, customs disruptions) quantified and mitigated when choosing shipping lanes and modes?

9. What are the trade-offs of running assembly 24/7 in terms of defect rates, workforce sustainability, maintenance schedules, and the ability to respond to design changes?

10. How is “quality checks & diagnostics” defined (sampling vs. 100% inspection), and how does the quality strategy balance cost, time-to-market, and customer experience?

11. When devices fail quality checks, how is the decision made between rework and scrap, and how are root causes tracked to prevent recurring defects?

12. What feedback loops exist from quality outcomes back to R&D, supplier quality, and assembly process engineering, and how quickly do changes propagate?

13. How are packaging and labeling designed to support regulatory requirements, localization (language/charger standards), anti-counterfeiting, and reverse logistics?

14. What criteria determine which markets receive air freight versus ocean freight, and how is that decision adapted during product launches, promotions, or supply shocks?

15. How is customs clearance and regulatory compliance managed across regions (e.g., certifications, import restrictions, data privacy rules), and what contingencies exist for surprise regulatory changes?

16. At regional distribution centers, how are priorities set among retailer replenishment, e-commerce fulfillment, and VIP/pre-orders when inventory is constrained?

17. How is stakeholder communication structured across suppliers, logistics partners, assembly, and regional DCs to ensure shared visibility into delays, shortages, and quality issues?

18. Which performance metrics best reflect end-to-end success (e.g., perfect order rate, cash-to-cash cycle, forecast accuracy, yield, time-to-market), and how are metric trade-offs resolved?

19. How does the organization detect and respond to “demand changes” in time to adjust supplier orders, given lead times and minimum order quantities—what signals are most trusted?

20. If you could redesign one gateway decision (exclusive or parallel) in this process to improve resilience or speed, which would it be and what evidence would justify the change?
