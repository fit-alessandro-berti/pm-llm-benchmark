 **1. Identifying Cases with Longer Total Resolution Times:**

To identify cases with significantly longer total resolution times, we need to calculate the duration from when the ticket was received to when it was closed for each case. Here are the calculations:

- Case 101: 08:00 on 2024-03-01 to 10:15 on 2024-03-01 = 2 hours and 15 minutes
- Case 102: 08:05 on 2024-03-01 to 09:15 on 2024-03-02 = 25 hours and 10 minutes
- Case 103: 08:10 on 2024-03-01 to 09:30 on 2024-03-01 = 1 hour and 20 minutes
- Case 104: 08:20 on 2024-03-01 to 08:30 on 2024-03-02 = 24 hours and 10 minutes
- Case 105: 08:25 on 2024-03-01 to 09:30 on 2024-03-03 = 49 hours and 5 minutes

From the above, cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times compared to cases 101 and 103.

**2. Determining Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues:**

- **Escalations:** Cases 102 and 105 were escalated to a Level-2 Agent, which seems to be a common factor in the longer resolution times. This suggests that escalation might introduce delays, possibly due to the unavailability of Level-2 Agents, the complexity of issues requiring Level-2 expertise, or inefficient escalation processes.

- **Investigation Delays:** For case 105, there was a significant delay between the escalation and the subsequent investigation by the Level-2 Agent (from 10:00 on 2024-03-01 to 14:00 on 2024-03-02). This could indicate that Level-2 Agents are overburdened, leading to long waiting times for escalated tickets.

- **Time of Day:** Case 104's resolution happened to cross over two business days (from late on 2024-03-01 to early on 2024-03-02), which might suggest that tickets that are not resolved within a single business day may face additional delays due to the end-of-day and start-of-day processes.

- **Weekend Impact:** Case 105 was not resolved until the third day, which included a weekend. This suggests that weekend staffing levels or the availability of specialized teams could be a bottleneck.

**3. Insights and Recommendations:**

- **Improve Escalation Processes:** Review the escalation procedures to reduce delays. Consider increasing the number of Level-2 Agents or implementing a triage system that ensures only the most complex issues are escalated.

- **Resource Allocation:** Ensure that there are enough Level-2 Agents to handle the volume of escalated tickets. This might involve hiring more staff, redistributing workloads, or training more Level-1 Agents to handle complex issues.

- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Implement or revise SLAs for escalations to ensure that tickets do not remain unattended for extended periods, especially across weekends and outside of regular business hours.

- **Prioritization of Tickets:** Develop a better system for prioritizing tickets to ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first, reducing the overall resolution time.

- **Proactive Ticket Management:** Monitor tickets that are nearing the end of the business day and ensure that they are either resolved or handed over effectively to the next available agent to prevent additional delays.

- **Continuous Training:** Provide ongoing training for all agents to improve their skills and reduce the number of escalations required.

- **Workforce Management:** Analyze ticket arrival patterns and agent performance to optimize staffing levels throughout the day and week, including potential shifts in coverage to address gaps during and around weekends.

By addressing these factors, the customer support team can aim to reduce the total resolution time for tickets and improve overall performance and customer satisfaction.
