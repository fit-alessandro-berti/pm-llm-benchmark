### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - **Average Time:** 25 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - **Hypothesis:** This unusually short average time with a very low standard deviation suggests a rigid, possibly artificial schedule for approval that is not explained by the business logic.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - **Average Time:** 7 days
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days
   - **Hypothesis:** The extremely long average delay and high standard deviation indicate that sometimes notification is heavily delayed or happens very quickly. This inconsistency may reflect an internal backlog or resource constraints.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - **Hypothesis:** The relatively quick closure after assignment, without seeing steps like Evaluate or Approve consistently in between, might suggest some claims are prematurely closed.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - **Average Time:** 5 minutes
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute
   - **Hypothesis:** The very short average time between evaluation and notification suggests a too-quick transition that might not realistically align with business rules, or indicates skipping of other intermediate steps.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Specific Claims with Unusual Timing:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce1.claim_id,
       ce1.activity AS activity1,
       ce2.activity AS activity2,
       ce1.timestamp AS timestamp1,
       ce2.timestamp AS timestamp2,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
   FROM
       claim_events ce1
   JOIN
       claim_events ce2
   ON
       ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   AND
       ce1.activity = 'R'
   AND
       ce2.activity = 'A'
   WHERE
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 3600
       OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 3600
   ```

2. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       aj.name AS adjuster_name,
       COUNT(*) AS num_anomalies
   FROM
       claim_events ce
   JOIN
       adjusters aj
   ON
       ce.resource = aj.adjuster_id
   WHERE
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - LAG(ce.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp))) > 3600
       OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - LAG(ce.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp))) < 3600
   GROUP BY
       aj.name
   ```

3. **Filter Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce.claim_id,
       ce.activity AS activity,
       ce.timestamp
   FROM
       claim_events ce
   WHERE
       ce.activity = 'A'
       AND ce.timestamp + INTERVAL '2 hours' > (SELECT MAX(ce2.timestamp) FROM claim_events ce2 WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C')
   ```

4. **Check Claims with Excessively Long Approval to Notification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       ce.claim_id,
       ce.activity AS activity,
       ce.timestamp
   FROM
       claim_events ce
   WHERE
       ce.activity = 'P'
       AND ce.timestamp + INTERVAL '7 days' > (SELECT MAX(ce2.timestamp) FROM claim_events ce2 WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N')
   ```

These SQL queries will help in identifying specific claims, correlating anomalies with adjusters, and filtering claims based on unusual timing patterns, providing insights into the potential reasons for the anomalies.
