Based on the provided declarative process model constraints, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Declaration and Payment Process

**Actors:**
1. Employee
2. Supervisor
3. Pre-Approver (optional)
4. Administration (optional)
5. Budget Owner (optional)

**Initial Activity:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`

**Main Flow:**

1. **Declaration Submission and Approval:**
   - An employee submits a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
   - The supervisor approves the final declaration exactly once (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Exactly 1`).

2. **Payment Request and Handling:**
   - After the declaration is approved, the employee requests a payment (`Request Payment`, `Responded Existence` with approval).
   - The payment is handled exactly once (`Payment Handled`, `Exactly 1`).
   - There's a chain precedence between `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` and `Request Payment`, and between `Request Payment` and `Payment Handled`.

3. **Alternating Activities:**
   - The activities `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`, `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`, and `Payment Handled` alternate without repetitions (`Alternate Response`, `Alternate Precedence`, `Alternate Succession`).

**Additional Constraints:**

- **Co-Existence:** Most activities co-exist with each other, meaning if one occurs, the others might also occur.
- **Succession:** There's a succession between most activities, indicating that they happen in the order listed (`Succession`, `Chain Succession`).
- **Absence:** Certain activities are not allowed to occur: `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, etc.

**Initialization and Finalization:**

- The process starts with the employee submitting a declaration (`Initialization`).
- There's no specific final activity, but it ends after the payment is handled.
