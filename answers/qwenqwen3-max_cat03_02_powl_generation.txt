from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Initial activities
SR = Transition(label="SR")   # Service Request verification
CS = Transition(label="CS")   # Contract Setup

# Step 2: Concurrent Datacenter Allocation and Access Control Initialization
DA = Transition(label="DA")   # Datacenter Allocation
ACI = Transition(label="ACI") # Access Control Initialization

# Step 3: Looped configuration phase
BNC = Transition(label="BNC") # Base Network Configuration
DR = Transition(label="D&R")  # Debug & Reconfigure

# Loop: execute BNC, then optionally DR followed by BNC again until stable
# In POWL loop semantics: * (A, B) means: do A; then either exit, or do B and then A again
config_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 4: Exclusive choice between deployment methods
CD = Transition(label="CD")   # Containerized Deployment
MD = Transition(label="MD")   # Monolithic Deployment

# XOR choice between CD and MD
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 5: Final concurrent tasks
QA = Transition(label="QA")   # Quality Assurance
SA = Transition(label="SA")   # Security Audit

# Step 6: Final Go-Live Approval
GLA = Transition(label="GLA") # Go-Live Approval

# Build the overall POWL structure using nested StrictPartialOrder nodes

# First, create the initial sequence: SR -> CS
initial_phase = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])
initial_phase.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# Next, the parallel preparation phase: DA and ACI (no order between them)
prep_phase = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
# No edges added -> fully concurrent

# Then, the configuration loop
# This comes after prep_phase

# Then, the deployment choice
# This comes after the loop

# Then, the final QA and SA (concurrent)
final_verification = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
# No edges between QA and SA -> concurrent

# Finally, GLA comes after both QA and SA

# Now assemble everything in the correct partial order

# Create the root partial order containing all major phases as nodes
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    initial_phase,
    prep_phase,
    config_loop,
    deployment_choice,
    final_verification,
    GLA
])

# Define ordering constraints:
# 1. CS must finish before prep_phase (DA and ACI) can start
root.order.add_edge(initial_phase, prep_phase)

# 2. prep_phase must finish before config_loop can start
root.order.add_edge(prep_phase, config_loop)

# 3. config_loop must finish before deployment_choice can start
root.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_choice)

# 4. deployment_choice must finish before final_verification (QA and SA) can start
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, final_verification)

# 5. Both QA and SA (inside final_verification) must finish before GLA can start
root.order.add_edge(final_verification, GLA)
