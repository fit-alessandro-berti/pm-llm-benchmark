from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define atomic activities
SR = Transition(label="Service Request")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Step 2: Build the loop for configuration: BNC -> (D&R or exit)
# Loop structure: execute BNC, then either exit or do D&R and repeat
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 3: Build the exclusive choice between deployment methods
# XOR between Containerized Deployment and Monolithic Deployment
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 4: Build the concurrent/unordered final verification phase (QA and SA)
final_verification = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
# No edges between QA and SA — they are concurrent

# Step 5: Build the main partial order that sequences the entire process

# First partial order: after SR, CS must be done
initial_phase = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])
initial_phase.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# Second partial order: after CS, DA and ACI can be done concurrently
setup_phase = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[CS, DA, ACI])
setup_phase.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
setup_phase.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# Third partial order: after DA and ACI, the looped configuration begins
# We need to combine all previous elements and connect them properly
# Instead of chaining partial orders (which is not directly supported),
# we build one comprehensive root partial order that captures all dependencies.

# Let's create the root POWL model as a StrictPartialOrder containing all major components
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    SR, 
    CS, 
    DA, 
    ACI, 
    loop_config, 
    deployment_choice, 
    QA, 
    SA, 
    GLA
])

# Define ordering constraints:

# SR must precede CS
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# CS must precede both DA and ACI
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# DA and ACI must both precede the loop_config (since loop starts after both are done)
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_config)

# loop_config must precede deployment_choice
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, deployment_choice)

# deployment_choice must precede both QA and SA (final verification phase)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, QA)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, SA)

# Both QA and SA must precede GLA
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Note: QA and SA have no edge between them — they are concurrent

# The root POWL model is now fully constructed
```

This POWL model accurately represents the described telecom provisioning process:

- It begins with **Service Request**, which must complete before **Contract Setup**.
- **Contract Setup** enables concurrent execution of **Datacenter Allocation** and **Access Control Initialization**.
- After both DA and ACI complete, the system enters a **loop** of **Base Network Configuration** and optional **Debug & Reconfigure**.
- Upon successful configuration, an **exclusive choice** is made between **Containerized Deployment** and **Monolithic Deployment**.
- After deployment, **Quality Assurance** and **Security Audit** run concurrently (no ordering between them).
- Finally, **Go-Live Approval** occurs only after both QA and SA are completed.

All dependencies and concurrency are modeled using `StrictPartialOrder` with appropriate edges, while choice and loop constructs use `OperatorPOWL` with `XOR` and `LOOP` operators respectively.
