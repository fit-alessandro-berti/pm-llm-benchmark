# Merged Event Log: Integrated Order Fulfillment Events

### Overview & Matching Reasoning

The goal is to merge **Log A (System A)**—the primary timeline with minimal attributes—and **Log B (System B)**—richer with user context, resource IDs, and fine-grained timestamps—into a unified, chronologically ordered event record. When events represent the same logical activity, attributes are merged including timestamps (using a small tolerance for minor skew), and missing attributes are noted.

---

### Step 1: Timestamp Alignment and Event Matching

A tolerance of **2 seconds** is applied to compare timestamps from both logs. Differences beyond that suggest events are disparate.

### Step 2: Event Naming Conventions and Semantic Matching

| Log A        | Log B        | Name Match / Translation                           | Notes                                 |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Order Received  OrderReceived    | OrderReceived  | Direct name matching — confirmed match          |
| Order Validated  OrderValidation & OrderValidation | OrderValidation                      | Log B uses full phrase; aligns with Log A's `Order Validation` |
| Payment Processed  PaymentCheck     | PaymentCheck   | Match: value and intent similar; attach note |
| Item Shipped  Shipping               | Shipping       | Yes, consistent naming                        |
| Item Delivered  Item Delivered       | Item Delivered | Exact match                               |

### Step 3: Merged Events List

| Merged Order ID | Global Event Name     | - Timestamp (UTC)           | - Timestamp Tolerance       | - Merged Attributes (from A + B)                                                                 | Notes on Merge & Attributes                                                                |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order#1234     | Order Received       | 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z       | Primary event – no match needed in B | Timestamp from A (10:00:00) < 10:01:30 (B)  2s tolerance  match  | Full: Order received  no additional attributes needed.                                   |
| Order#1234     | Order Validation     | 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z       | Matched to Order Received event (timing) | A: event_type=Order Validation (from B) tightly time-aligned with A  merge into one record with combined attrs from both sources. |
|  | Payment Processed    | 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z       | Matched to Order Delivered event (results matched) | Log A lacks payment status; B shows payment *check* at 10:02:05, close enough to align with "Payment Processed" intent | Payment delay (B) inferred from Processed log; merge to reflect completion inference. |
|  | Item Shipped         | 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z       | Matched to Item Delivered event | Timing spans 4.5 mins – plausible progression | Both events occur for Order#1234; ship *after* validation, prep, payment, and demo – log A lacks timing, B adds plausible sequence. |
|  | Item Delivered       | 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z       | Matched to Item Delivered event | Identical name and timestamp close enough (<3s) to merge, reinforcing sequence unity |  
|  | Quality Check        | 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z       | **Insufficient match**             | Log A has no corresponding event; closest is Quality Check at 10:03:00 but at different time (10:05 vs 10:03)  too far apart. Use A’s timeline. | Leave separate – no reliable match. |
|  | Payment Check        | 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z       | Matched to Payment Processed via inference | B shows payment check at 10:02:05; A shows payment used at 10:02:00 — both reflect same activity. Merge to reflect “Payment processed & checked” across logs. |                                                                                             |

### Notes on Missing Events or Discrepancies

- **No events in Log B** directly align with `Payment Processed` or `Item Delivered` as standalone events—present alongside merger reasoning from context notes.  
- **Quality Check** not found in Log A for this order—extracted only from Log B, with time proximity noted but insufficient for merge due to timing offset.  
- **Timestamp skew**: Log B events are older by a few seconds overall but within 2-second tolerance; this suggests clock offset rather than missed events, so temporal continuity preserved.  
- **Event naming variations** resolved using semantic alignment (e.g., “OrderReceived” vs “Order Received”  normalized to best match).  
- **User & Resource IDs**: Absent in Log A and largely absent in Log B (only `u45` appears in B). Absence preserved; no user attribution added.  
- Since Log A is authoritative on timing, its timeline defines event anchors. Log B traits enrich context but are only merged when events align closely.

### Final Output: Chronologically Ordered Merged Log (Unified Events)

| Merged Order # | Global Event Name                     | Timestamp       | Attributes Summary                                                                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1234          | Order Reception & Validation Sequence | 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z | - Order Received (Log A)<br>- Order Validation (Log B, merged)<br>- Payment Process Check (merged inference from Log B)<br>- Item Shipped (Log A)<br>- Item Delivered (Log A & B) |
| 1234          | Payment Processing & Confirmation     | 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | - Payment Processed (A)<br>- Payment Check (inferred from B, merged at 10:02:05)<br>- Error: Item Delivered occurred before Payment Check log time—reconciled as sequential resolution |
| 1234          | Fulfillment<=Shipping/Delivery       | 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z | - Item Shipped (A)<br>- Item Delivered (A+B)<br>- Quality Check (qualitative; not timestamped, omitted from merging) |
