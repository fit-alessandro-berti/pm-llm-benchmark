<think>We are given a task: Given a process description (normative) and an event log with multiple cases, we need to determine which cases violate the normative process. We also need to explain the violations referencing textual description.

I'll read carefully the provided text:

Normative Process Description:
- The process always begins with "Receive order".
- After receiving the order, next step is "Check inventory" before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment are made.
- If inventory sufficient: then process continues as follows: after check inventory, do "Authorize Payment", then "Package Items", then "Ship Order", then "Close Order". The sequence becomes Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close.

If inventory is not enough:
- Process branches to cancellation scenario. So after "Check Inventory" if insufficient stock then process should directly proceed with "Cancel order". Then "Close order". That gives a short sequence: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.
- It says: After an order is canceled it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (packaging or shipping). So cancellation must preclude packaging and shipping. Also, payment authorization should only occur after checking inventory in the "fulfillment" branch, but if insufficient inventory, no payment should happen.
- Additionally, normative constraints:
-- Authorize Payment should only occur after Check Inventory and before Packaging.
-- Package Items should only occur after Authorization and before Shipping.
-- Ship Order should occur after Packaging and never after cancellation.
-- Close Order is final activity.

Also note "any deviation" such as shipping after cancellation, authorizing payment before check inventory, or packaging items before authorization would be considered violation.

Now we check each case in the event log:

Let's analyze each:

Case 1:
- Timestamps: 
   - Receive order at 09:00,
   - Check inventory at 10:00 (okay)
   - Authorize payment at 11:00 (okay, after check)
   - Package items at 12:00 (okay, after authorization)
   - Ship order at 13:00 (okay, after package)
   - Close order at 14:00 (final activity).
No violations. Sequence matches expected process for sufficient inventory. So case 1 is correct.

Case 2:
Timestamps:
   - Receive order at 09:00
   - Check inventory at 09:30 (first check)
   - Package items at 10:00. But wait, then it's followed by Authorize payment at 10:30 and then Ship Order at 11:00.
Check the expected sequence for a case with sufficient inventory: It must be Receive order, Check Inventory, Authorize Payment, Package Items, Ship Order, Close Order. But here we have "Package items" performed before authorization. And also there is an out-of-order event: "Authorize payment" occurs after "Package items". The normative description says that "Authorize payment should only occur after check inventory and before packaging". In case 2, the order of events is:
   - Receive order,
   - Check inventory,
   - Package items,
   - Authorize payment.
So violation: Payment authorization happens after package. Also possibly additional deviation: The process doesn't do cancellation steps? Let's re-read: "Authorize payment should only occur after check inventory and before packaging." Here, it is reversed. So violation: Order must not package items before authorizing payment because that means the order was packaged even though payment was not authorized yet.
So case 2 violates by performing Package Items before Authorize Payment. Also, note shipping happens next (which is also wrong because packaging should happen before ship, but in this scenario it's already happened out-of-order? But more importantly, package items event occurs after check inventory but before authorization is allowed only if authorized payment comes first. So violation: Packaging order is done out-of-sequence.)

Case 3:
Timestamps:
   - Receive order at 09:00,
   - Check inventory at 09:20,
   - Authorize payment at 09:40.
So far, sequence appears to be correct for sufficient inventory branch? But then the next event is "Cancel order" at 10:00.
Wait but after cancellation, shipping should not occur. So what's next? After "Cancel order", there is "Ship order" at 10:30 and then "Close order". But normative process says that if insufficient inventory, then after Check Inventory, we must go directly to Cancel order and then Close order. There should be no Authorize Payment in a cancellation scenario.
But wait the normative description states: "if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order, the process must branch into a cancellation scenario." So in such a case, after Check Inventory, if it's insufficient, you do Cancel Order. But here we have Authorize Payment before cancellation. This might be considered ambiguous? Let me re-read: "the process always begins with Receive and then Check inventory" but if check shows insufficient stock, then branch directly to Cancel order. So the normative description says that the cancellation scenario is triggered by a negative inventory outcome (not enough stock) after checking. But in case 3, they did Authorize Payment before cancel. Is it allowed? The text "if not found sufficient" then branch. But here, we see: Check inventory, then Authorize payment, then Cancel order.
What is the normative description about that? It says: "if the inventory is found to be sufficient, then follow normal progression" and if insufficient, then after check inventory, go directly to cancel order without any payment authorization. In case 3, there's a violation because cancellation happens after authorizing payment but not following the normal process order for cancellations. But wait, what is "sufficient" vs "insufficient"? The text says: "if inventory found to be sufficient then do payment authorization else if insufficient then cancel". So in this scenario it appears that after check inventory, they authorized payment. That implies that the check was positive? Yet cancellation happened afterwards. It seems ambiguous: if an order is canceled after authorizing payment, then maybe we have a process violation because normally cancellation should come directly from Check Inventory when insufficient stock is found.
But let me re-read case 3 timeline:
Receive order,
Check inventory,
Authorize Payment,
Cancel order,
Ship order,
Close order.

So violation: The normative description clearly states that if there is not enough stock, the process must branch to Cancel order immediately after Check Inventory, skipping Authorization. So having Authorize payment in a cancellation scenario violates this. Additionally, another violation: "Ship order" should never occur after cancellation. But in case 3, after cancel order at 10:00, they proceed with Ship order at 10:30 and then Close order. That is explicitly stated as "Shipping after cancellation" which is not allowed.

So violations for Case 3:
1. The process branch is inconsistent: Payment was authorized before the cancellation decision. According to normative description, if inventory check indicates insufficient stock, then the process should go directly to cancel order without payment authorization.
2. Also, shipping activity occurs after cancellation, which violates "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."

So Case 3 has two violations: Payment before cancellation in a situation that seems to be a cancellation scenario (because eventually there is a cancel event), and then also shipping after cancellation.

Case 4:
Timestamps:
   - Receive order at 09:00,
   - Check inventory at 09:10,
   - Cancel order at 09:20,
   - Close order at 09:50.
Sequence for insufficient stock branch should be: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. And indeed that's what we see here. There is no packaging or shipping which is correct because cancellation should not have subsequent fulfillment steps. So Case 4 seems to conform perfectly.

Case 5:
Timestamps:
   - Receive order at 09:00,
   - Check inventory at 10:00,
   - Authorize payment at 10:30,
   - Ship order at 11:00,
   - Close order at 11:30.
So what is missing? According to the normative description, after Authorize Payment should come "Package items", then Ship Order. But in case 5 there's no Package items event. So violation: The sequence for sufficient inventory must be Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package Items, Ship Order, Close Order. Here packaging is missing. And rule says: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping." In this case, the process skipped package items entirely, which means that shipping happened immediately after authorizing payment, violating the normative ordering (because the item packaging step must happen between authorization and shipping).
But wait, let me check: Is it possible to skip package if inventory is sufficient? The description says "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items'." So that's required. Therefore case 5 violation: Packaging step missing.

Thus answer:

Case 1: Compliant.
Case 2: Violates process due to out-of-order execution of Payment Authorization and Package Items. Explanation: Payment authorization should occur before packaging, but in Case 2 the events are reversed. Additionally, shipping occurs after packaging is done incorrectly? Wait check order: Actually in case 2 sequence: Receive, Check, then Package items, then Authorize payment, then Ship order, then Close order. The violation: Package items executed before authorize payment (contradicting rule that authorization must happen before packaging) Also, note that shipping should occur after packaging and not directly after unauthorized payment? But here it's shipping after package, but the problem is in ordering of payment authorization vs packaging.

Case 3: Violates process because:
- It branches into cancellation scenario yet includes an authorization payment event prior to cancellation. Normally if inventory check indicates insufficient stock, one should cancel order immediately (i.e., no payment authorization). 
- Also, ship order occurs after cancellation which is not allowed.
So explanation for case 3.

Case 4: Compliant.
Case 5: Violates process because packaging step is missing; in a sufficient inventory scenario the process must include package items before shipping. So violation of "package items should occur between payment authorization and shipping".

We can also check if any ambiguous interpretation exists? Let me re-read question:
"Identify which cases deviate from intended process flow, and explain what rules are being violated." We have explained.

I will now generate answer accordingly in plain text with numbering. I'll mention for each case that violates the normative sequence: Cases 2, 3, and 5.

Case 2 is out-of-order events: "Package items" comes before "Authorize Payment". Rule violation: Payment must be authorized after checking inventory but before packaging.
Case 3 has a branch problem: It includes payment authorization then cancellation. Also, shipping occurs after cancellation which violates the rule that shipping should never occur after cancellation.
Case 5 misses a mandatory step: Packaging should occur between payment authorization and shipping in sufficient inventory scenario; missing package items is non-compliant.

I'll now produce answer accordingly.

Double-check: Do we need to check if there's any other violation? Let's re-read the process description text:
- "Authorize Payment" only happens after Check Inventory. In case 2, that is respected? Actually in case 2, Authorize payment occurs after package items. But rule states that authorize payment must happen before packaging. So violation.
- "Ship Order should occur after packaging and never after cancellation." In case 3, ship order follows cancellation, which violates the condition.
- "Close Order should be final" but we have it in all cases.

Thus answer is as above.

I'll produce answer with clear numbering: Cases that violate are 2, 3, and 5. I'll include reasoning for each.

I'll now produce text answer accordingly.</think>Below is an analysis of each case compared to the normative process description:


Case 1:
• Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
• Analysis: This case follows the ideal “sufficient stock” sequence exactly as described. There are no violations.


Case 2:
• Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
• Violations & Explanation:
1. Outof-Order Events – The normative description requires that after checking inventory, the next step must be “Authorize payment” (to ensure that payment is only confirmed once inventory sufficiency is known) before any packaging occurs. In Case 2, “Package items” comes immediately after “Check inventory” and precedes “Authorize payment.” This violates the rule that authorization should happen before packaging.
2. Although shipping follows packaging here, the core issue is that the ordering between payment authorization and packaging is reversed.


Case 3:
• Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.
• Violations & Explanation:
1. Branching Error – The normative process states that if the inventory check reveals insufficient stock, the process must branch to a cancellation scenario immediately (i.e. after “Check inventory,” it should go directly to “Cancel order” without payment authorization). In Case 3, however, payment is authorized before the cancellation decision.
2. Post-Cancellation Fulfillment – Even if one interprets this case as an attempted fulfillment that was later canceled, the process description clearly prohibits any fulfillment activities (such as shipping) after a cancellation. Here “Ship order” occurs after “Cancel order,” which violates the rule that shipping should never occur following a cancellation.


Case 4:
• Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.
• Analysis: This case adheres to the “insufficient stock” branch as described. It omits any fulfillment steps (authorization, packaging, shipping) and directly goes from canceling to closing the order. There are no violations.


Case 5:
• Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
• Violation & Explanation:
1. Missing Mandatory Step – In a sufficient-inventory scenario, after “Authorize payment” the process must include “Package items” before proceeding to ship the order. Case 5 omits this packaging step entirely. Packaging is essential because it ensures that the items are prepared for shipment. Skipping this step violates the normative requirement that shipping can only occur after proper packaging.


Summary of Violations:
• Case 2: The ordering error (packaging before payment authorization) breaks the rule that “Authorize payment” must come immediately after “Check inventory.”
• Case 3: Two issues – first, authorizing payment when a cancellation is later initiated contradicts the intended immediate branch to “Cancel order” upon insufficient stock; second, shipping occurs after a cancellation.
• Case 5: The process omits the required “Package items” activity between authorization and shipping.

Only Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the intended normative process.
