 Certainly! A Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process typically involves several steps from the purchase request to the final payment of the invoice. Here's a simplified version of the P2P process with some hypothetical timings for the temporal profile:

1. **Purchase Request (PR)** - The employee raises a purchase request.
2. **Purchase Order (PO) Creation** - The procurement team creates a purchase order based on the purchase request.
3. **PO Approval** - The purchase order is reviewed and approved by the relevant authority.
4. **Order Placement (OP)** - The purchase order is sent to the supplier, and the order is placed.
5. **Goods Receipt (GR)** - The goods are received, and the receipt is logged in the system.
6. **Invoice Receipt (IR)** - The invoice is received from the supplier.
7. **Invoice Approval (IA)** - The invoice is matched with the purchase order and goods receipt and approved for payment.
8. **Payment (P)** - The payment is processed and sent to the supplier.

Now, let's assume some average times and standard deviations for the steps in the P2P process. These values are hypothetical and would vary based on the organization's efficiency, the complexity of the purchase, and other factors.

    ('PR', 'PO'): (24, 6),  # Average 24 hours, STDEV 6 hours for PO creation after PR
    ('PO', 'OP'): (48, 12),  # Average 48 hours, STDEV 12 hours for order placement after PO
    ('OP', 'GR'): (120, 24),  # Average 120 hours (5 days), STDEV 24 hours for goods receipt after OP
    ('GR', 'IR'): (24, 6),  # Average 24 hours, STDEV 6 hours for invoice receipt after GR
    ('IR', 'IA'): (48, 12),  # Average 48 hours, STDEV 12 hours for invoice approval after IR
