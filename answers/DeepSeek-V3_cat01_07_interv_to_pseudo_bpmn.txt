### BPMN-like Textual Process Model for Invoice Approval Process

#### **1. Activities/Tasks**
- **Receive Invoice**: Invoice arrives via email.
- **Check for PO Number**: Verify if the invoice has a valid purchase order (PO) number.
- **Log Invoice**: Log the invoice into the accounting system.
- **Forward to Purchasing**: Send the invoice to the Purchasing department for confirmation of goods/services received.
- **Match Invoice to PO**: Compare invoice line items with the PO details in the system.
- **Resolve Discrepancies**: Address any mismatches (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items) by contacting the Purchasing team or supplier.
- **Escalate to Supervisor**: If discrepancies cannot be resolved, escalate to the Accounts Payable Supervisor.
- **Request Manager Approval**: Send the invoice to the Department Manager for final approval.
- **Schedule Payment**: Add the approved invoice to the payment run.
- **Handle Exceptions**: Address invoices without POs or informal service contracts by creating retrospective POs or rejecting the invoice.
- **Contact Supplier**: Engage the Supplier Relationship Manager to resolve issues with suppliers.

#### **2. Sequence Flow**
1. **Receive Invoice** → **Check for PO Number**:
   - If the invoice has a valid PO number, proceed to **Log Invoice**.
   - If the invoice lacks a PO number, send it back to the supplier for clarification.
2. **Log Invoice** → **Forward to Purchasing**.
3. **Forward to Purchasing** → **Match Invoice to PO**:
   - If the invoice matches the PO, proceed to **Request Manager Approval**.
   - If there are discrepancies, proceed to **Resolve Discrepancies**.
4. **Resolve Discrepancies**:
   - If resolved, proceed to **Request Manager Approval**.
   - If unresolved, proceed to **Escalate to Supervisor**.
5. **Escalate to Supervisor** → **Handle Exceptions**:
   - After handling exceptions, return to **Forward to Purchasing**.
6. **Request Manager Approval**:
   - If approved, proceed to **Schedule Payment**.
   - If rejected, return to **Resolve Discrepancies** or **Escalate to Supervisor**.
7. **Schedule Payment**: End of process.

#### **3. Gateways/Decision Points**
- **Gateway 1 (Check for PO Number)**:
  - Condition: Does the invoice have a valid PO number?
    - Yes: Proceed to **Log Invoice**.
    - No: Send back to the supplier.
- **Gateway 2 (Match Invoice to PO)**:
  - Condition: Does the invoice match the PO?
    - Yes: Proceed to **Request Manager Approval**.
    - No: Proceed to **Resolve Discrepancies**.
- **Gateway 3 (Resolve Discrepancies)**:
  - Condition: Are discrepancies resolved?
    - Yes: Proceed to **Request Manager Approval**.
    - No: Proceed to **Escalate to Supervisor**.
- **Gateway 4 (Manager Approval)**:
  - Condition: Is the invoice approved by the manager?
    - Yes: Proceed to **Schedule Payment**.
    - No: Return to **Resolve Discrepancies** or **Escalate to Supervisor**.

#### **4. Roles/Participants**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**: Logs invoices, matches them to POs, resolves discrepancies, and escalates issues.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Confirms receipt of goods/services and verifies invoice details against the PO.
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Approves or rejects invoices after verification.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**: Handles exceptions and escalations, coordinates with departments and suppliers.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**: Assists in resolving supplier-related issues (e.g., missing PO numbers, pricing discrepancies).

#### **5. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**
- **Inputs**:
  - Invoice (received via email).
  - Purchase Order (PO) details.
  - Confirmation of goods/services received.
- **Outputs**:
  - Approved invoice.
  - Payment schedule.
  - Resolved discrepancies or rejected invoices.

#### **6. Exceptions/Variations**
- **Missing PO Number**: Invoices without a PO number are sent back to the supplier for clarification.
- **Discrepancies in Invoice**: Mismatches in pricing, quantities, or items trigger resolution efforts involving Purchasing, Accounts Payable, and the Supplier Relationship Manager.
- **Escalation to Supervisor**: Unresolved discrepancies are escalated to the Accounts Payable Supervisor for further action.
- **Informal Service Contracts**: Invoices for services without a formal PO require retrospective PO creation or rejection.
- **Manager Rejection**: If the manager identifies suspicious details, the invoice is rejected or held for further investigation.

#### **7. Ambiguities/Uncertainties**
- The exact process for handling informal service contracts is not fully detailed. It is unclear whether retrospective POs are always created or if some invoices are rejected outright.
- The role of the Supplier Relationship Manager is primarily reactive (resolving issues) and not explicitly part of the standard flow.
- The timing and frequency of escalations to the Accounts Payable Supervisor are not quantified.
