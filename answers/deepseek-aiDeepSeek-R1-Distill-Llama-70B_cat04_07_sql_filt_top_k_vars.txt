Okay, I need to solve this problem using DuckDB SQL. Let me read the requirements again to make sure I understand everything. 

So, there's an event_log table with case_id, activity, and timestamp. A process variant is the ordered sequence of activities in each case, sorted by timestamp. 

The tasks are:
1. Construct a query to get the activity sequence for each case_id, ordered by timestamp.
2. Group cases by their complete activity sequence to find unique variants.
3. Count how many cases are in each variant and get the top K variants by frequency.
4. Return all events from the cases that are in these top K variants.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, for each case, I need to get the sequence of activities in the order they occurred. That means for each case_id, I need to order the activities by timestamp and then concatenate them into a string or something that represents the sequence.

I think using a window function like ROW_NUMBER() might help here. I can partition by case_id and order by timestamp to assign a row number to each activity within a case. Then, I can group by case_id and collect all activities in order.

Wait, but how do I aggregate the activities into a sequence? Maybe using STRING_AGG with an order. Oh, right, in DuckDB, the STRING_AGG function can take an ORDER BY clause. So, for each case_id, I can order the activities by timestamp and then aggregate them into a single string, separated by commas or something.

Once I have the variant for each case, I can group by that variant string and count the number of cases per variant. Then, I need to find the top K variants based on their counts.

After identifying the top K variants, I need to filter the original event_log to include only the cases that belong to these variants. 

Let me think about how to structure this. First, perhaps a Common Table Expression (CTE) to get the variant for each case. Then, another CTE to get the counts and rank the variants. Then, join back to the event_log to filter the cases.

But wait, I need to make sure that in the first step, each case has its activities ordered correctly. So, the first CTE would select case_id and the STRING_AGG of activity ordered by timestamp. 

Then, in the second CTE, I can count the number of case_ids for each variant and rank them. Maybe using a window function like RANK() or DENSE_RANK() to get the top K.

Once I have the top K variants, I can get the case_ids that belong to them. Then, select all events from the event_log where case_id is in that list.

Wait, no. The top K variants are based on the count of cases, not the events. So, first, I need to get the top K variants by the number of cases, then collect all case_ids that have those variants, and then select all events from those case_ids.

But how do I handle the ranking? Let's see. After grouping by variant and counting, I can order the variants by count descending and then take the top K. 

So, putting it all together:

1. CTE1: For each case_id, create the variant string by ordering activities by timestamp and aggregating.
2. CTE2: Group by variant, count the number of cases, and rank them.
3. CTE3: Select the top K variants based on the rank.
4. CTE4: Get all case_ids that belong to these top K variants.
5. Finally, select all events from event_log where case_id is in CTE4.

Wait, but in DuckDB, I can't directly reference CTE4 in the final SELECT unless I use multiple CTEs. Alternatively, I can use subqueries.

Let me outline the steps in SQL.

First, get the variant for each case:

WITH variants AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)

Then, count the cases per variant:

variants_count AS (
  SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM variants
  GROUP BY variant
)

Then, rank the variants by count:

ranked_variants AS (
  SELECT variant,
         count,
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY count DESC) as rank
  FROM variants_count
)

Then, get the top K variants:

top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM ranked_variants
  WHERE rank <= K
)

Then, get all case_ids that have these variants:

cases_in_top_k AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_k_variants)
)

Finally, select all events where case_id is in cases_in_top_k:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_in_top_k)

Wait, but in DuckDB, you can't have multiple CTEs like this unless you chain them. Alternatively, you can combine them into a single query.

Alternatively, I can do it all in one query with subqueries.

Wait, but let's think about the final query structure.

The main idea is to get all events from cases that are in the top K variants. So, perhaps I can write it as:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT case_id,
           STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
  ) AS variants
  WHERE variant IN (
    SELECT variant
    FROM (
      SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as count
      FROM (
        SELECT case_id,
               STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
      ) AS variants
      GROUP BY variant
    ) AS variant_counts
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
  )
)

Wait, but this might be inefficient because it's repeating the same subqueries multiple times. Maybe using CTEs would be better.

Let me try writing it with CTEs.

WITH variants AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY count DESC
  LIMIT K
),
cases_in_top_k AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_k_variants)
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_in_top_k)

Wait, but in DuckDB, the LIMIT clause without an ORDER BY doesn't guarantee which rows are returned. So, in variant_counts, I should order by count DESC before applying LIMIT K.

So, the top_k_variants CTE should have:

SELECT variant
FROM variant_counts
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT K

That makes sense.

But wait, what if there are ties in the counts? For example, if the Kth and (K+1)th variants have the same count, the LIMIT K would arbitrarily choose one. But according to the problem statement, it's acceptable to take the top K, so perhaps it's fine.

Now, putting it all together, the final query would be as above.

But let me test this logic with an example. Suppose K=2.

Sample event_log:

case_id | activity | timestamp
1 | A | 2020-01-01
1 | B | 2020-01-02
1 | C | 2020-01-03
2 | A | 2020-01-01
2 | C | 2020-01-02
3 | A | 2020-01-01
3 | B | 2020-01-02
4 | D | 2020-01-01

Variants:

case 1: A,B,C
case 2: A,C
case 3: A,B
case 4: D

Counts:

A,B,C: 1
A,C:1
A,B:1
D:1

If K=2, then the top 2 variants would be the first two in the ordered list, but since all counts are 1, it might pick any two. But in practice, the order would depend on how DuckDB sorts them, perhaps alphabetically.

But in any case, the query should correctly pick the top K based on frequency.

Another example: if K=1, and the highest count is 3 for variant X, then only cases with variant X are included.

So, the query seems correct.

But wait, in the cases_in_top_k CTE, I'm selecting case_id from variants where variant is in top_k_variants. That should give me all case_ids that belong to the top K variants.

Then, the final SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (...) would include all events from those cases.

Yes, that should work.

But in DuckDB, can I have multiple CTEs like that? I think so. Alternatively, I can write it as a single query with subqueries, but CTEs make it more readable.

So, the final query would be:

WITH variants AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY count DESC
  LIMIT :K
),
cases_in_top_k AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_k_variants)
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_in_top_k);

Wait, but in DuckDB, the LIMIT clause uses a literal or a parameter. Since K is a variable, I need to pass it as a parameter, perhaps using a placeholder like :K.

But in the problem statement, K is a variable, so the query should accept K as a parameter. So, in the top_k_variants CTE, I can use LIMIT :K.

Alternatively, if K is a fixed number, I can just put the number there.

But the problem says "top K variants", so K is a parameter. So, using :K makes sense.

However, in DuckDB, when using a parameter in a LIMIT clause, it needs to be an integer. So, the user would have to prepare the statement with K as a parameter.

Alternatively, if K is a variable in the query, perhaps using a scalar subquery.

But for the purpose of this answer, I think using LIMIT :K is acceptable.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the user is to write a SQL query that does these steps. So, the query should include K as a parameter.

Alternatively, the query can have K as a variable, but in DuckDB, variables are set with SET, so perhaps the query expects K to be set beforehand.

But perhaps the problem expects K to be a placeholder, so the query can include it as a parameter.

Alternatively, the query can use a scalar subquery to get K, but that might complicate things.

In any case, the main structure is as above.

Wait, but in the cases_in_top_k CTE, I'm selecting case_id from variants where variant is in top_k_variants. But variants is the first CTE, which already groups by case_id and creates the variant string. So, that should correctly map each case to its variant.

Yes.

So, the final query should correctly return all events from the cases that are part of the top K variants.

I think this covers all the requirements.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to identify the top K process variants from an event log and return all events corresponding to these variants. Here's the structured approach using DuckDB SQL:

1. **Extract Activity Sequences**: For each case, determine the sequence of activities ordered by timestamp.
2. **Group by Variants**: Identify unique process variants by grouping cases with identical activity sequences.
3. **Count and Rank Variants**: Count the occurrences of each variant and rank them by frequency.
4. **Filter Top K Variants**: Select the top K variants based on their frequency.
5. **Retrieve Events**: Return all events from the cases that belong to these top K variants.

Here is the DuckDB SQL query implementing these steps:

```sql
WITH variants AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY count DESC
  LIMIT :K
),
cases_in_top_k AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_k_variants)
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_in_top_k);
```

**Explanation:**

- **variants CTE**: This extracts the activity sequence for each case by grouping events and using `STRING_AGG` to concatenate activities in timestamp order.
- **variant_counts CTE**: Aggregates cases by their variant and counts occurrences.
- **top_k_variants CTE**: Selects the top K variants based on their counts.
- **cases_in_top_k CTE**: Identifies all case_ids belonging to the top K variants.
- **Final SELECT**: Retrieves all events from the event log where the case_id is in the top K variants.

This query efficiently processes the event log to determine and filter the most frequent process variants, ensuring that only relevant events are returned.
