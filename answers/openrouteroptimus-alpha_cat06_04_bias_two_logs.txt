Let's analyze both event logs for **signs of bias**, focusing on these factors:

- **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** status
- **ScoreAdjustment** values
- **Final Decisions** (Approved/Rejected)
---

### **Summary Table**

| Group  | LocalResident status | CommunityGroup present? | ScoreAdjustment presence | Score boost applied? | Final score effect | Approval outcomes           |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **A**  | Always FALSE        | None                   | Always 0/N/A            | Never                | No adjustment      | 2 Approved, 1 Rejected      |
| **B**  | Always TRUE         | Some have group        | Present, sometimes >0   | YES for group        | Boost for group    | 2 Approved, 1 Rejected      |

## **Detailed Analysis**

### 1. **Score Adjustments and CommunityGroup Influence**

#### **Group A (Protected Group):**
- **No Local Residents**
- **No CommunityGroup membership**
- **ScoreAdjustment** is **0** for all cases, regardless of application details.
- **No case receives a score boost**.

#### **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
- **All are Local Residents**
- Some have **CommunityGroup membership** (e.g. "Highland Civic Darts Club").
- If CommunityGroup is present, a **+10 ScoreAdjustment (Community Boost)** is given in Scoring steps.
    - E.g., U001 and U003 both receive +10.
- Those without CommunityGroup get **0 score adjustment**.

---

### 2. **Impact on Decisions**

- **Threshold Effect:** It's clear higher scores improve chances.
    - In both groups, P002 (710) and U002 (710) are rejected, others with 720+ or >700 + boost are approved.
- **Score Boost in B:** In Group B, U003 receives boost from 695  705, enabling approval **where an equivalent Protected Group applicant (with 695) would be rejected**.
    - Protected Group with similar score wouldn't be approved, as they cannot receive the same +10.

---

### 3. **Factors Driving Bias**

- **CommunityGroup-based Score Adjustment is only available to Group B.**
    - Group A: No one has a CommunityGroup (“None”).
    - Group B: “Highland Civic Darts Club” gives a +10 boost. This boost can tip a borderline decision to "Approved".

- **LocalResident Exclusivity:** Only Group B applicants are "TRUE" for LocalResident, all Protected Group members are "FALSE".
    - Systematically, this suggests only unprotected groups have access to the Community Boost via group membership.

---

### 4. **How Bias Manifests**

- **Structural/Procedural Bias:** The process rewards CommunityGroup membership, but in practice, only members of the Unprotected Group (Group B) can access it—none in the Protected Group have this opportunity.
- **Indirect Discrimination:** Even if the rules are "Community Boost for members", if protected group members never qualify (due to residency or other undisclosed restrictions), it produces **systematic disparate outcomes**.

#### **Example:**
- **U003** (B): Starts at 695, gets +10, reaches 705, **Approved**.
- **If P004** (A) had 695 (no boost option), would likely be **Rejected**.

---

## **Conclusion: Which Log Exhibits Bias?**

### **Group B's Log Exhibits Bias**

**How:**
- The **CommunityGroup score boost** is only ever given to LocalResidents with CommunityGroup membership—a status **never held by the Protected Group (A)**.
- **Protected Group (A) is systematically denied access to scoring boosts** available to Unprotected Group (B) members, giving the unprotected group an *unfair advantage* in final decisions, especially near decision thresholds.

**Result:**
- **Group A is at a structural disadvantage**: Applications of equivalent merit (score) are less likely to be approved if the applicant is from the Protected Group, solely due to lack of access to a boost that seems only available to the Unprotected Group.

---

**Summary Statement:**

> The logs demonstrate **biased differential treatment**: Only Unprotected Group members (LocalResidents, sometimes with CommunityGroup) benefit from a positive "ScoreAdjustment", directly increasing their approval likelihood. Protected Group members never receive this boost; thus, the process introduces systemic bias that disadvantages the Protected Group. This is a classic manifestation of indirect discrimination—where a facially neutral rule (score boost for group members) is applied in a way that excludes the protected class.
