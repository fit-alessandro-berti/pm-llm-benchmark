We are going to synthesize the information from the five interviews to create a BPMN-like textual process model.
 Steps:
 1. Identify the roles: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), and Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).
 2. List the activities and their sequence, including decision points and exceptions.
 3. Note any data objects (like invoice, PO, email, etc.).
 4. Handle inconsistencies and note uncertainties.

 Let's break down the process based on the interviews:

 - Start: Invoice received (by email) by Accounts Payable (Mary).
 - Mary checks for PO number: 
      - If no PO -> Mary sends back to supplier (exception: missing PO).
      - If PO present -> Mary logs the invoice into the accounting system.

 - Then, Mary forwards the invoice to Purchasing (Dan) for confirmation of goods/services received and matching with PO.

 - Dan (Purchasing) verifies the invoice against the PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges):
      - If there is a discrepancy (e.g., extra units, incorrect pricing) -> 
          - Dan may contact the supplier directly OR ask Mary to hold the invoice until corrected version is received.
          - Alternatively, if PO number is missing, Dan tells Mary to get that information (this is an exception: missing PO number in the invoice even though Mary thought she had it? Or Dan finds it missing? According to Dan: "if the PO number is missing, I tell Mary ...". So we have a loop here: Mary sends to Dan, Dan finds missing PO, then Dan tells Mary to get PO, then Mary gets PO and then again sends to Dan? Or does Dan wait for Mary to provide? The interview doesn't specify, so we note: if Dan finds the PO missing, he requests Mary to get the PO information. This might happen after Mary has already logged (which required a PO) so it might be that Mary only checked that the invoice had a PO number but Dan cannot find the PO in the system? Or Dan might be checking a different system? We'll assume that Mary logs with the PO number but Dan might not be able to find the PO in his system, hence the request. This is an exception that requires a loop.

      - If everything is correct -> Dan sends confirmation email back to Mary.

 - After Dan's confirmation, Mary (or the system) matches the invoice line items against the PO in the system? 
      - According to Mary: "Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system." 
      - Then, if there's a discrepancy (like incorrect pricing or missing items) -> Mary emails the purchasing team (Dan) to clarify. 
          - This might be a rework loop? Or a new exception? 
          - Also, Mary says if the discrepancy can't be resolved easily, escalate to supervisor (Rita).

 - If the matching is okay, then Mary sends the invoice to the department manager (Carlos) for approval.

 - Carlos (Department Manager) reviews the invoice (with PO and confirmation). 
      - If he sees something suspicious (big difference, unexpected items) -> he might reject it or ask Mary to hold and investigate. 
          - This could be escalated to Rita? Or handled by Mary? According to Carlos: he asks Mary to hold and investigate. Then, if resolved, it might come back to him? Or if rejected, it goes to Rita? The interview doesn't specify, but Rita's role is for exceptions. So we'll note that if the manager rejects or holds, it might be an exception that goes to Rita.

 - If approved by Carlos, then the invoice goes to Accounts Payable (Mary) to schedule for payment.

 However, note that there are exceptions:

  - If Mary initially sends back to supplier (for missing PO) and then when the supplier sends a corrected invoice, the process restarts? (We assume so, but not explicitly stated.)

  - Dan might ask Mary to hold the invoice until supplier sends corrected version (for pricing discrepancy). Then Mary would wait and then send again to Dan? But the interview doesn't specify the loop. We'll assume that after the corrected version is received, Mary logs it and then sends to Dan again.

  - Rita (Supervisor) steps in when:
        - Mary can't match the invoice (or discrepancy can't be resolved) -> escalate to Rita.
        - Dan has an issue that can't be resolved (like missing PO that Dan found, but Mary might not have provided? Or Dan's issue with the invoice that can't be resolved with supplier) -> escalated to Rita.
        - Also, for invoices without PO (even after Mary's initial check? Or for informal services) Rita creates a retrospective PO or rejects.

  - Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager) is looped in by AP or Purchasing for resolving issues with the supplier (like providing PO, correcting pricing). She doesn't do any approval but helps resolve by contacting the supplier.

 Now, let's structure the process:

 Steps:

 1. Start Event: Invoice received (by email) at Accounts Payable.

 2. Task: Check Invoice for PO (by Mary)
      - Gateway: PO present?
          - Yes: Log invoice into accounting system (Mary)
          - No: Mary sends back to supplier -> then we wait for response? (Exception: missing PO) -> then we receive again? But the process would restart? We can model as:
                - Subprocess: Handle missing PO
                    - Activity: Mary sends back to supplier (with request for PO)
                    - Wait for response (we don't model waiting, but note that after this, the invoice is received again? So we can have a loop arrow? But in BPMN, we can show as a loop or use an event subprocess. However, we are in textual form. We'll note an exception path: "In case of no PO, Mary sends to supplier and the invoice must be re-processed once received with PO".)

 3. Task: Forward invoice to Purchasing (Dan) for verification (Mary)
      - Then Dan verifies invoice against PO:
          - Task: Dan verifies invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against PO.
          - Gateway: Correct?
              - Yes: Dan sends confirmation email to Mary.
              - No: 
                  - If missing PO: Dan tells Mary to get PO information -> then Mary must get the PO and then re-send to Dan? We can model as:
                        - Activity: Dan informs Mary about missing PO
                        - Then Mary gets the PO (from supplier? or from her records?) and then forwards again to Dan? But we don't have details. We'll note: Mary must obtain the PO and then the invoice is sent again to Dan (so loop back to task "Forward invoice to Purchasing").
                  - If discrepancy (other than missing PO): 
                      - Dan may: 
                          a) Contact supplier directly for correction? -> then wait for corrected invoice? (But note: Dan says "we either contact the supplier ... or ask the Accounts Payable clerk to hold the invoice until ... corrected version". So two options: 
                              Option 1: Dan contacts supplier -> then the corrected invoice comes? Then Mary would log and send to Dan again? 
                              Option 2: Dan asks Mary to hold and wait for corrected version from supplier? Then Mary would wait and then send again to Dan?
                          - In either case, we have a loop: after the corrected invoice is received (or sent by Dan?) we go back to Dan's verification? But note: if Dan contacts the supplier, then the corrected invoice might come to Mary and then Mary would start the process again? Or Dan might get it? The interviews don't specify.

                  - Alternatively, we can model an exception path: if there's a discrepancy, then Dan either:
                      - Activity: Contact supplier and wait for correction (then the corrected invoice is received by AP and the process restarts? Or we can have a loop: back to Dan's verification? But we don't know who gets the corrected invoice. We assume it comes to AP and then they start the process again? That would be inefficient. So we'll model a loop: after correcting, Dan re-verifies? But that might not be what happens. We'll note ambiguity: "If a discrepancy is found, Dan may either contact the supplier directly (and then the corrected invoice is sent to AP, restarting the process) or ask AP to hold the invoice until a corrected version is received (then AP will re-send to Dan)."

                  - Also, Mary might escalate to Rita if the discrepancy can't be resolved? But that is mentioned by Mary: "Sometimes, if the discrepancy can’t be resolved easily, I have to escalate it to my supervisor."

 4. After Dan's confirmation, Mary does:
      - Task: Mary matches invoice line items against PO in system.
          - Gateway: Match?
              - Yes: proceed.
              - No: 
                  - Mary emails purchasing (Dan) to clarify? -> then Dan would check again? Or this is a new discrepancy? Then we have a loop: Dan verifies again? And then we are back to Dan's verification? Or if the issue is resolved, then we proceed? 
                  - If not resolved, escalate to Rita.

 5. Task: Send invoice to Department Manager (Carlos) for approval (Mary)
      - Carlos reviews.
          - Gateway: Approve?
              - Yes: Approved (then move to scheduling)
              - No: 
                  - Carlos might reject or ask Mary to hold and investigate. Then Mary would investigate and if resolved, it might come back to Carlos? Or go to Rita? According to Carlos: he asks Mary to hold and investigate. Then if resolved, it would go back to him? But if not resolved, then to Rita? We don't have details. We'll note: if the manager rejects or holds, it becomes an exception and is escalated to Rita? Or Mary handles it? The interview doesn't specify. But Rita says she comes into play when there are exceptions and Mary escalates. So we assume that if the issue can't be resolved by Mary, it goes to Rita.

 6. Task: Schedule for payment (Mary)

 However, note that Rita and Karen play roles in exception handling. We can model:

  - If at any step an exception is escalated to Rita, then Rita will handle by contacting suppliers (via Karen) or coordinating between departments. Then, after resolution, the invoice is sent back to the point where it was held? Or to the next step? According to Rita: "After we clear up these exceptions, the invoice goes back into the normal flow: confirmation from Purchasing, approval by the Manager, then scheduling for payment."

  So when an exception is resolved by Rita, the process continues from the point after Purchasing confirmation? Or after Dan's confirmation? Actually, Rita says: "confirmation from Purchasing, approval by the Manager". So it goes back to the step after Dan's confirmation? But note: Dan's confirmation is already done? Then why go through Dan again? This might be for the exceptional cases that were escalated. We'll assume that after exception resolution, the invoice is sent again to Dan for confirmation? But that might not be necessary if the issue was resolved. Alternatively, Rita might send it directly to the manager? But Rita says: "confirmation from Purchasing, then approval by the Manager". So we can model:

      - After exception resolution by Rita, the process restarts from Dan's confirmation? Or we can model as:

          - Task: Rita coordinates resolution (with Karen, suppliers, etc.)
          - Then, after resolution, the invoice is sent to Dan for confirmation (even if it was already done? but the circumstances changed). Or, if the issue was resolved without needing to re-verify the entire invoice, then we skip Dan? 

  Given the complexity, we'll note that after exception resolution, the invoice is put back into the normal flow at the stage of Purchasing confirmation? But that might be inefficient. Alternatively, we can model that the exception handling by Rita leads to:

      - If the exception was about missing PO or PO mismatch: then after resolution, Mary logs and sends to Dan.
      - If the exception was about discrepancy: then after resolution, Dan re-verifies? Or Mary matches again? 

  However, Rita says: "confirmation from Purchasing, then approval by the Manager". So we can model a separate path for resolved exceptions:

      - After resolution, the invoice goes to Dan for confirmation (just like a new one) and then proceeds to the manager? But that might be redundant for some exceptions.

  Given the ambiguity, we'll model:

      - When an exception is escalated to Rita, she handles it and then the invoice is sent back to Dan for confirmation (if the exception was resolved and the invoice is now in order) and then to the manager. But note: if the exception occurred after Dan's confirmation (like in the manager's step), then Rita sends it back to the manager? But Rita says she sends it to confirmation from Purchasing? So regardless of where the exception occurred, after resolution, it goes to Dan? This might be a simplification.

  Alternatively, we can model the exception handling as a separate lane or with conditional flows. But in textual form, we can describe:

      - The main flow: as above.
      - Exception flows: whenever an exception occurs, the following happens:
          - Escalate to Rita (or in some cases, first to Dan and then if not resolved to Rita? But the interviews don't specify the order. Mary says she escalates to Rita when she can't resolve. Dan doesn't mention escalating to Rita, but to Mary or directly to supplier. Carlos doesn't mention escalation beyond Mary. Rita says she is contacted by Mary when there are exceptions. So we assume that the escalation is always through Mary to Rita? Or sometimes Dan might escalate? The interviews don't show that. So we'll assume that Mary is the one who escalates to Rita.

  Therefore, we can model:

      - Any step where an exception occurs and cannot be resolved by the current role (without escalation) will be sent to Rita.

  Steps with exceptions:

      - At Mary's initial PO check: if missing PO -> no escalation to Rita? Mary handles by sending to supplier. But if the supplier doesn't respond? Then we don't know. We'll assume that if the supplier responds, the process continues. If not, it might be stuck? But the interviews don't cover that.

      - At Dan's verification: if Dan finds missing PO, he tells Mary to get it. Then Mary must get the PO and then re-send. If she can't get it? Then she escalates to Rita? Not specified. We'll assume that if Mary can't get the PO, she escalates to Rita.

      - At Mary's matching: if discrepancy -> try to clarify with Dan. If not resolved, escalate to Rita.

      - At Carlos's approval: if he rejects or holds -> then Mary investigates. If Mary can't resolve, she escalates to Rita.

      - Also, Rita mentions: sometimes invoices without PO (that might be for services) -> then she works with department heads to create retrospective PO. This might happen at the beginning? But Mary's initial step is to check for PO. So if Mary gets an invoice without PO, she sends back. But if it's for informal services, then it might come back without PO? Then Rita steps in? The interview doesn't specify when that happens. We'll assume that if Mary receives an invoice without PO and the supplier doesn't provide one, then Mary escalates to Rita? Or if it's for services, Rita will create a retrospective PO? We'll model: if the invoice is without PO and cannot be resolved by the supplier, then Mary escalates to Rita.

  So we have multiple points of escalation:

      - After Dan's verification: if Mary can't get the PO (after Dan requested) -> Mary to Rita.
      - After Mary's matching: if Dan can't clarify the discrepancy -> Mary to Rita.
      - After manager's approval: if Mary's investigation fails -> Mary to Rita.
      - After Mary's initial check: if the invoice has no PO and the supplier doesn't respond (or if it's for informal services) -> Mary to Rita.

  Then Rita:
      - Rita will coordinate (with Karen, suppliers, departments) to resolve the exception.
      - After resolution, Rita sends the invoice back to the normal flow at the step of Dan's verification? (as per Rita: "confirmation from Purchasing, then approval by the Manager")

  But note: if the exception was resolved and the invoice now has the required information (and is in order), then Dan's verification might be a formality? We can model that after Rita, the invoice goes to Dan for confirmation? Then if Dan confirms, then to the manager. But if the exception was resolved and the invoice is complete, then Dan should confirm.

  Also, note Karen: she is called by AP or Purchasing to help with supplier issues. We can model her as a separate role that assists in exception handling.

 Now, let's write the textual BPMN-like model:

 Roles:
   - Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   - Purchasing Officer (Dan)
   - Department Manager (Carlos)
   - Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
   - Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)

 Events:
   - Start: Invoice received by email at Accounts Payable.
   - End: Invoice scheduled for payment.

 Data Objects:
   - Invoice
   - Purchase Order (PO)
   - Confirmation Email (from Dan to Mary)
   - Approval (by Carlos)
   - Payment Scheduling

 Process Steps:

 1. Start Event: Invoice arrives at Accounts Payable (Mary).

 2. Task: Mary checks for PO number on the invoice.
    - Gateway (Decision): PO present?
        - Yes: 
            2.1. Task: Mary logs invoice into accounting system.
            2.2. Task: Mary forwards invoice to Dan (Purchasing Officer) for verification. [Data: Invoice, PO]
        - No:
            2.3. Task: Mary sends invoice back to supplier requesting PO. [Data: Invoice]
            2.4. Wait for supplier's response (with corrected invoice including PO) -> then go to step 1 again? Or we can model as an intermediate event: on receipt of corrected invoice, go to step 2.1? But we don't have an explicit step for re-receiving. We'll assume that the corrected invoice is received and then the process restarts at step 1.

 3. Task: Dan verifies invoice details against PO. [Data: Invoice, PO]
    - Gateway (Decision): Correct?
        - Yes:
            3.1. Task: Dan sends confirmation email to Mary. [Data: Confirmation]
            3.2. -> Proceed to step 4.
        - No:
            3.3. If missing PO: 
                 - Task: Dan informs Mary that PO is missing.
                 - Then: Mary must obtain the PO (from supplier or records). [This is a task for Mary: Mary obtains PO from supplier? But the interview doesn't specify how. We'll assume Mary contacts the supplier for the PO if not already provided? Or if Dan found it missing after Mary's log, then Mary might have to get it from her records? We'll leave ambiguous: Mary gets the PO information.]
                 - Then: Mary sends the invoice (with the obtained PO) to Dan again -> go to step 3.
            3.4. If discrepancy (other than missing PO):
                 - Gateway (Decision): Can Dan resolve without escalation?
                     - Yes: Dan contacts supplier for correction. Then wait for corrected invoice? Then go to step 1? Or Dan receives the corrected invoice? We'll assume Dan receives the corrected invoice and then verifies again -> go to step 3? (But note: the corrected invoice might come to Mary and then Mary would start over? We'll model: after Dan contacts the supplier, the corrected invoice is sent to Dan? Then Dan verifies again -> step 3. But Mary might not be involved? We don't know. We'll note ambiguity: "If Dan contacts the supplier, it is assumed that the corrected invoice comes to Dan for re-verification.")
                     - No: -> then Dan cannot resolve? Then the invoice goes back to Mary? And Mary escalates? But Dan says he either contacts the supplier or asks Mary to hold. So if he asks Mary to hold, then:
                         - Task: Dan asks Mary to hold the invoice and wait for corrected version from supplier.
                         - Then Mary waits for the corrected invoice. When received, Mary logs and sends to Dan (so go to step 2.2 and then step 3? But step 2.2 is forwarding, so then step 3).
                 - If the discrepancy cannot be resolved (after Dan's efforts), then Dan informs Mary that it cannot be resolved -> then Mary escalates to Rita? (But the interview doesn't specify. We'll assume that if Dan cannot resolve, he tells Mary and then Mary escalates to Rita.)

 4. Task: Mary matches the invoice line items against the PO in the system. [Data: Invoice, PO, Confirmation]
    - Gateway (Decision): Match?
        - Yes: -> proceed to step 5.
        - No:
            4.1. Task: Mary contacts Dan (Purchasing) to clarify the discrepancy.
            4.2. If Dan can clarify (e.g., by providing more information) then try matching again: loop back to step 4? 
            4.3. If Dan cannot clarify (or the discrepancy is not resolved), then escalate to Rita: 
                  - Task: Mary escalates to Rita with the issue.

 5. Task: Mary sends invoice to Carlos (Department Manager) for approval. [Data: Invoice, PO, Confirmation]
    - Task: Carlos reviews the invoice.
    - Gateway (Decision): Approve?
        - Yes: 
            5.1. Task: Carlos approves the invoice.
            5.2. -> proceed to step 6.
        - No:
            5.3. Task: Carlos rejects and/or asks Mary to hold and investigate. [Data: Invoice with rejection reason]
            5.4. Task: Mary investigates the issue.
            5.5. If resolved: 
                   - Then send to Carlos again? Or does Carlos re-approve? We'll assume that after resolution, the invoice is sent back to Carlos for approval (so loop back to step 5? but then we are in the same step). Alternatively, we can model as a new instance? We'll note: after resolution, the invoice is resubmitted to Carlos for approval (step 5).
            5.6. If not resolved: -> escalate to Rita.

 6. Task: Mary schedules the invoice for payment. [Data: Approved Invoice]
 7. End Event: Invoice scheduled.

 Exception Handling (via Rita):

   - Whenever an exception is escalated to Rita (from any of the above steps: step 2.3 (if the supplier never responds? not specified), step 3.3 (if Mary cannot obtain the PO after Dan's request), step 4.3 (discrepancy with Dan not resolved), step 5.6 (manager rejection not resolved by Mary)), then:

       E1. Task: Rita handles the exception (may involve coordinating with Karen, suppliers, and departments).
       E2. During this process, Karen might be involved:
            - Task: If needed, Rita contacts Karen to help with supplier issues.
            - Task: Karen contacts the supplier to resolve the issue (e.g., provide PO, correct pricing) and then informs Mary or Rita.
       E3. After resolution, Rita ensures the invoice is passed to Dan for verification (per Rita: "confirmation from Purchasing"). Then the process continues from step 3? But note: step 3 requires an invoice and a PO. If the exception was resolved, the invoice now has the required information. So:
            - E4. Task: Dan verifies the resolved invoice (same as step 3).
            - Then the process continues from step 3's outcome? But note: step 3 might have already been done? Actually, we are re-verifying the invoice after the exception is fixed.

       However, Rita says: "After we clear up these exceptions, the invoice goes back into the normal flow: confirmation from Purchasing, approval by the Manager, then scheduling for payment."

       So after Rita, the invoice goes to:
            - Dan for confirmation (step 3)
            - Then to Mary for matching (step 4)
            - Then to Carlos for approval (step 5)
            - Then to Mary to schedule (step 6)

       But note: if the exception was resolved and the invoice is now in order, then Dan's verification might be a quick formality? But we model the same steps.

   - We model the exception handling as a subprocess that starts after escalation and then feeds back to step 3.

   - However, note that if the exception was resolved and the necessary information (like PO) has been provided, then step 3 (Dan's verification) might be skipped? But Rita explicitly says it goes to confirmation from Purchasing. So we include step 3 again.

   - We'll note: the same invoice might be passed through the same steps multiple times? But that is acceptable.

 Now, we write the model in a structured textual form.

 We'll use:

   - Roles: [Role]
   - Events: (Event type: Event name)
   - Activities: [Role] Task description
   - Gateways: (Gateway type: Diamond) with conditions
   - Data: [Data: DataObject]

 We'll also note uncertainties.

 However, the prompt asks for a model that another person could convert into a BPMN diagram. So we need to be clear.

 Let's write:

 BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

 Roles:
   - AP_CLERK (Mary)
   - PO_OFFICER (Dan)
   - DEPT_MANAGER (Carlos)
   - AP_SUPERVISOR (Rita)
   - SRM (Karen)

 Events:
   - Start: Invoice received by email at Accounts Payable.
   - End: Invoice scheduled for payment.

 Data Objects:
   - Invoice
   - Purchase Order (PO)
   - Confirmation (from Dan)
   - Approval (from Carlos)

 Steps:

 1. [Event] Start Event: Invoice received by email at Accounts Payable.

 2. [AP_CLERK] Check Invoice for PO.
    - [Data] The invoice has a PO? -> No: Missing PO.
    - If missing PO:
        2.1. [AP_CLERK] Send invoice back to supplier requesting PO. [Data: Invoice]
            - [Event] Intermediate Catching Event: Waiting for corrected invoice from supplier.
                - On receiving corrected invoice (with PO): go to step 2.2 (log and forward to Dan).
        2.2. [AP_CLERK] Log invoice into accounting system. [Data: Invoice, PO]
        2.3. [AP_CLERK] Forward invoice to PO_OFFICER (Dan) for verification. [Data: Invoice, PO]

 3. [PO_OFFICER] Verify invoice details against PO.
    - [Data] The invoice details are correct? -> No: Discrepancy found.
    - If discrepancy found:
        3.1. If missing PO (despite step 2) -> 
              3.1.1. [PO_OFFICER] Inform AP_CLERK that PO is missing.
              3.1.2. [AP_CLERK] Obtain PO (from supplier or records). [Uncertainty: How?]
              3.1.3. Then go to step 2.2 (log and forward to Dan) [Note: step 2.2 requires the invoice and PO, so we assume the AP_CLERK now has the PO for the invoice?]
        3.2. If discrepancy (other than missing PO):
              3.2.1. [PO_OFFICER] Decide resolution approach:
                   - [Gateway] Option: Contact supplier directly for correction? 
                      - If yes: 
                         3.2.1.1. [PO_OFFICER] Contact supplier for corrected invoice.
                         - [Event] Intermediate Catching Event: Wait for corrected invoice from supplier.
                            - On receiving corrected invoice: 
                                - This corrected invoice is sent to PO_OFFICER? Or to AP_CLERK? We assume to AP_CLERK? Then:
                                    - [AP_CLERK] Receives corrected invoice -> then step 2: Check PO? (But now it has PO) -> log and forward to Dan (step 2.2 and 2.3) -> then Dan verifies again (step 3).
                      - If not (i.e., ask AP_CLERK to hold):
                         3.2.1.2. [PO_OFFICER] Ask AP_CLERK to hold invoice and wait for corrected version from supplier.
                         3.2.1.3. [AP_CLERK] Wait for corrected invoice from supplier.
                            - On receiving corrected invoice: 
                                - [AP_CLERK] Then log and forward to Dan (step 2.2 and 2.3) -> then Dan verifies again (step 3).
    - If no discrepancy (or after resolving a discrepancy by one of the above paths and then Dan re-verifies and finds it correct):
        3.3. [PO_OFFICER] Send confirmation email to AP_CLERK. [Data: Confirmation]

 4. [AP_CLERK] Match invoice line items against PO in system.
    - [Data] Matched? -> No: Discrepancy found.
    - If discrepancy found:
        4.1. [AP_CLERK] Contact PO_OFFICER (Dan) to clarify.
        4.2. If Dan clarifies (and the discrepancy is resolved): 
              - Then go to step 5? (But we are still in matching, so we need to re-match? We'll assume that after clarification, the AP_CLERK tries matching again)
              - [AP_CLERK] Try matching again -> go to step 4 (match). [But to avoid infinite loop, we rely on the fact that the discrepancy is resolved?]
        4.3. If Dan cannot clarify (or the discrepancy is not resolved after clarification): 
              - [AP_CLERK] Escalate to AP_SUPERVISOR (Rita) with the issue.

 5. [AP_CLERK] Send invoice to DEPT_MANAGER (Carlos) for approval. [Data: Invoice, PO, Confirmation]
    - [DEPT_MANAGER] Review the invoice.
    - [Data] Approved? -> No: Reject or hold.
    - If not approved:
        5.1. [DEPT_MANAGER] Reject and/or ask AP_CLERK to hold and investigate.
        5.2. [AP_CLERK] Investigate the issue.
        5.3. If resolved:
               - [AP_CLERK] Send the resolved invoice back to DEPT_MANAGER for approval (go to step 5, review again).
        5.4. If not resolved:
               - [AP_CLERK] Escalate to AP_SUPERVISOR (Rita) with the issue.

 6. [AP_CLERK] Schedule invoice for payment. [Data: Approved Invoice]
 7. [Event] End Event: Invoice scheduled.

 Exception Handling (by Rita):

   - When an exception is escalated to Rita (from steps: 2.1? Actually, step 2.1 is not a step number, we had step 2 as Check Invoice for PO and then step 2.1 to 2.3. Also, step 4.3 and 5.4 are escalation points. And also if the corrected invoice from Dan's contact (step 3.2.1.1) doesn't come? Then we don't have an escalation. We'll assume that if the corrected invoice never arrives, it becomes an exception and is escalated by AP_CLERK to Rita? But not specified. We'll only handle the explicit escalation points.)

   - Exception Handling Flow:

       E1. [AP_CLERK] Escalate issue to AP_SUPERVISOR (Rita). [This can happen at step 4.3, step 5.4, or after step 3.2 if the corrected invoice never arrives? We only cover the explicit ones.]

       E2. [AP_SUPERVISOR] Handle exception (may involve contacting SRM for supplier issues, or other departments). [Data: Issue]
           - If the issue involves the supplier:
               E2.1. [AP_SUPERVISOR] Contact SRM (Karen) for assistance.
               E2.2. [SRM] Contact supplier to resolve the issue (e.g., provide PO, correct pricing). [Data: Invoice details]
               E2.3. [SRM] Inform AP_SUPERVISOR of resolution (or providing corrected invoice).

       E3. [AP_SUPERVISOR] After resolution, send the invoice to PO_OFFICER (Dan) for verification (to start the normal flow). [Data: Resolved Invoice]
           - Then go to step 3: [PO_OFFICER] Verify invoice details against PO.

   - Note: This exception handling flow can be attached to the escalation points (step 4.3, step 5.4, and also if the corrected invoice from Dan's contact in step 3 never comes, we would assume AP_CLERK escalates to Rita? But we didn't model that. We'll note that any unresolvable issue at any step should be escalated, and we have covered the explicit ones.)

 Given the complexity, we have tried to capture the main flow and the exception handling. We note that there are ambiguities and uncertainties which we have tried to mark.

 This textual model should be detailed enough for a BPMN diagram.

 However, note that the process of waiting for a corrected invoice from the supplier is modeled as an intermediate catching event (which in BPMN is a none interrupting event if we don't want to break the current flow, or interrupting if we do). But in textual form, we have indicated with an event.

 But since the interviews are not fully detailed, we have made some assumptions.

 Let's write the final model in a structured way.

### BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

#### **Roles/Participants:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP_CLERK)**: Mary  
- **Purchasing Officer (PO_OFFICER)**: Dan  
- **Department Manager (DEPT_MANAGER)**: Carlos  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP_SUPERVISOR)**: Rita  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)**: Karen  

#### **Data Objects/Artifacts:**
- **Invoice**  
- **Purchase Order (PO)**  
- **Confirmation Email** (from Purchasing)  
- **Approval** (from Department Manager)  

---

### **Process Flow:**

1. **Start Event: Invoice Received**  
   - **Trigger:** Invoice arrives via email at Accounts Payable.  

2. **Task: Check for Valid PO**  
   - **Role:** AP_CLERK  
   - **Action:** Verify if the invoice includes a valid PO number.  
   - **Gateway: PO Present?**  
     - **Yes:** Proceed to *Log Invoice*.  
     - **No:**  
       - **Task:** Send invoice back to supplier requesting PO.  
       - **Exception:** Await supplier response. If unresolved, escalate to AP_SUPERVISOR.  

3. **Task: Log Invoice**  
   - **Role:** AP_CLERK  
   - **Action:** Enter invoice details into the accounting system.  

4. **Task: Forward to Purchasing for Verification**  
   - **Role:** AP_CLERK  
   - **Action:** Route invoice to PO_OFFICER.  

5. **Task: Verify Invoice Against PO**  
   - **Role:** PO_OFFICER  
   - **Action:** Confirm quantities, prices, and charges match the PO.  
   - **Gateway: Correct?**  
     - **Yes:** Send confirmation email to AP_CLERK.  Proceed to *Match Line Items*.  
     - **No:**  
       - **If PO is missing:**  
         - **Task:** Notify AP_CLERK to obtain PO.  
         - **Loop:** AP_CLERK re-subs to Purchasing upon PO receipt.  
       - **If pricing/quantity mismatch:**  
         - **Option 1:** Contact supplier directly for correction.  Await corrected invoice.  
         - **Option 2:** Ask AP_CLERK to hold invoice until corrected  Await corrected invoice.  
         - **Uncertainty:** If unresolved, PO_OFFICER may escalate to AP_SUPERVISOR.  

6. **Task: Match Line Items**  
   - **Role:** AP_CLERK  
   - **Action:** Cross-check invoice line items against PO in the system.  
   - **Gateway: Matched?**  
     - **Yes:** Proceed to *Request Manager Approval*.  
     - **No:**  
       - **Task:** Email PO_OFFICER to clarify discrepancy.  
       - **Exception:** If unresolved  Escalate to AP_SUPERVISOR.  

7. **Task: Request Manager Approval**  
   - **Role:** AP_CLERK  
   - **Action:** Submit invoice to DEPT_MANAGER via automated system email.  

8. **Task: Review Invoice**  
   - **Role:** DEPT_MANAGER  
   - **Action:** Validate invoice against PO, confirmation, and budget.  
   - **Gateway: Approve?**  
     - **Yes:** Provide approval in system.  Proceed to *Schedule Payment*.  
     - **No:**  
       - **Task:** Reject or request AP_CLERK to investigate.  
       - **Exception:** If unresolved  Escalate to AP_SUPERVISOR.  

9. **Task: Schedule Payment**  
   - **Role:** AP_CLERK  
   - **Action:** Add approved invoice to the next payment cycle.  

10. **End Event: Process Complete**  
    - **Trigger:** Invoice scheduled for payment.  

---

### **Exceptions & Escalations:**
- **Escalation Path (Handled by AP_SUPERVISOR):**  
  - **Trigger:** AP_CLERK escalates unresolved issues (e.g., missing PO, discrepancies).  
  - **Role:** AP_SUPERVISOR (Rita)  
    - **Task:** Coordinate resolution:  
      - Consult SRM (Karen) for supplier issues (e.g., missing PO, pricing errors).  
      - Facilitate inter-departmental talks for informal contracts.  
      - Create retrospective PO if needed.  
    - **Post-Resolution:** Return invoice to **Purchasing Verification** (Step 5) to restart normal flow.  

- **SRM Involvement (Handled by Karen):**  
  - **Trigger:** AP_CLERK or PO_OFFICER requests supplier intervention.  
  - **Role:** SRM  
    - **Task:** Contact supplier to:  
      - Provide/add PO number.  
      - Correct pricing/quantity errors.  
      - Resolve contractual disputes.  
    - **Outcome:** Supplier provides corrected invoice  Resubmit to **Log Invoice** (Step 3).  

---

### **Key Gateways/Decision Points:**
1. **PO Check:** After *Check for Valid PO* (Step 2).  
2. **Purchasing Verification:** After *Verify Invoice Against PO* (Step 5).  
3. **Invoice Matching:** After *Match Line Items* (Step 6).  
4. **Manager Approval:** After *Review Invoice* (Step 8).  

### **Visual Structure Summary for BPMN Diagram:**
- **Pools/Lanes:**  
  - AP_CLERK, PO_OFFICER, DEPT_MANAGER, AP_SUPERVISOR, SRM.  
- **Sequences:**  
  - Start (Invoice)  PO Check  Log  Purchasing  Match  Manager Approval  Payment  End.  
- **Alternate Paths:**  
  - PO Missing  Supplier Hold.  
  - Discrepancies  SRM/Supplier Resolution  Re-verify.  
  - Manager Reject  AP_CLERK Investigation  Supervisor Escalation  Re-verify.  
- **Annotations:**  
  - *"Supplier Hold"*  Loop to Purchasing on resolution.  
  - *"Escalation to Supervisor"*  Sub-process reconciles exception.  

This model consolidates all stakeholder accounts while explicitly noting ambiguities (e.g., Purchasing escalation paths) and exceptions. The output aligns with BPMN semantics and can be directly translated into a diagram.
