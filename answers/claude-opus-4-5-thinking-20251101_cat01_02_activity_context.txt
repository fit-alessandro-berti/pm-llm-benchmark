# Activity Renaming Analysis for Support Workflow Event Log

## 1. Identification of Recurring Activities

After analyzing the event log, I identified **three activities** that appear multiple times within the same case, each carrying different contextual meanings:

| Activity | Occurrences | Cases with Multiple Instances |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Verify Documents** | 5 times total | C001 (2x), C003 (2x) |
| **Call Customer** | 4 times total | C002 (2x) |
| **Initiate Request** | 3 times total | Different channels across cases |

## 2. Contextual Analysis and Renaming Logic

### **Verify Documents**
| Case | Position | Context | Renamed Activity |
|------|----------|---------|------------------|
| C001 | 1st occurrence | Initial identity check | **Initial Document Verification** |
| C001 | 2nd occurrence | Re-check after customer submitted missing ID | **Document Re-verification (Post-Submission)** |
| C002 | Only occurrence | Standard identity verification | **Initial Document Verification** |
| C003 | 1st occurrence | In-person physical ID check at branch | **Physical Document Verification (In-Branch)** |
| C003 | 2nd occurrence | Re-verification following account correction | **Document Re-verification (Post-Adjustment)** |

### **Call Customer**
| Case | Position | Context | Renamed Activity |
|------|----------|---------|------------------|
| C001 | Only occurrence | Request missing documents | **Outbound Call - Request Missing Documents** |
| C002 | 1st occurrence | Clarify account discrepancy | **Outbound Call - Clarify Discrepancy** |
| C002 | 2nd occurrence | Confirm adjustments were made | **Follow-up Call - Confirm Adjustments** |
| C003 | Only occurrence | Ask customer to return to branch | **Outbound Call - Request Customer Return** |

### **Initiate Request**
| Case | Channel | Context | Renamed Activity |
|------|---------|---------|------------------|
| C001 | WebPortal | Online submission | **Initiate Request (Online Portal)** |
| C002 | WebPortal | Online submission | **Initiate Request (Online Portal)** |
| C003 | BranchReception | Walk-in customer | **Initiate Request (Branch Walk-in)** |

## 4. Justification of Naming Choices

### **Verify Documents  Multiple Variants**

| New Name | Justification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Initial Document Verification** | First occurrence in the workflow; establishes baseline document check before any issues arise |
| **Document Re-verification (Post-Submission)** | Triggered *after* customer provides additional documents; the word "Re-" signals repetition, and "Post-Submission" indicates the trigger |
| **Physical Document Verification (In-Branch)** | Resource (BranchOfficer) and context indicate in-person verification of physical documents, distinct from back-office digital review |
| **Document Re-verification (Post-Adjustment)** | Occurs *after* an account adjustment; ensures documents still align with corrected account state |

### **Call Customer  Multiple Variants**

| New Name | Justification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Outbound Call - Request Missing Documents** | Context explicitly states the call's purpose: requesting missing documentation |
| **Outbound Call - Clarify Discrepancy** | Purpose is investigative—resolving an account discrepancy through customer communication |
| **Follow-up Call - Confirm Adjustments** | Temporal position (after adjustment) and purpose (confirmation) distinguish this as a follow-up rather than an initial outreach |
| **Outbound Call - Request Customer Return** | Unique branch scenario; the call serves a logistical purpose (recalling the customer) rather than information gathering |

### **Initiate Request  Channel-Based Variants**

| New Name | Justification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Initiate Request (Online Portal)** | Resource = WebPortal; indicates digital self-service channel |
| **Initiate Request (Branch Walk-in)** | Resource = BranchReception; indicates physical presence and different intake process |

## Summary of Key Insights

The renaming strategy focused on three contextual dimensions:

1. **Sequence Position**: Distinguishing first-time activities from repeated ones (e.g., "Initial" vs. "Re-verification")
2. **Triggering Event**: Identifying what caused the activity (e.g., "Post-Submission" vs. "Post-Adjustment")
3. **Channel/Mode**: Capturing how the activity was performed (e.g., "Physical," "Online Portal," "Branch Walk-in")

This approach ensures that process mining tools and analysts can correctly differentiate activities that share the same label but serve distinct process functions.
