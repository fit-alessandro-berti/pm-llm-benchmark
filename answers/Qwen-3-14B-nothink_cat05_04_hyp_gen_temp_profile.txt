### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R  P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Anomaly:** Average time of ~25 hours with a very low standard deviation (1 hour).  
   - **Observation:** This suggests a highly rigid and uniform approval process, which may not align with the complexity of different claim types or adjuster workloads.

2. **P  N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Anomaly:** Average time of 7 days with a high standard deviation (2 days).  
   - **Observation:** The large variation in time between approval and notification suggests inconsistency or potential bottlenecks in the notification process.

3. **A  C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Anomaly:** Average time of 2 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour.  
   - **Observation:** Claims are being closed very quickly after assignment, possibly skipping essential steps like evaluation or approval.

4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Anomaly:** Average time of 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1 minute.  
   - **Observation:** This extremely short interval may suggest that notification is happening too quickly after evaluation, possibly skipping steps or being automated without proper checks.

### Hypotheses for the Anomalies

1. **R  P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** This may indicate a system-level trigger or automated approval process that runs at a fixed interval, bypassing manual review for certain claim types or customers.

2. **P  N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** This could reflect a backlog in the notification process, possibly due to a lack of staff or inefficient communication systems, or alternatively, some claims are being notified immediately after approval, skipping a formal notification step.

3. **A  C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** Claims are being closed prematurely without going through the full evaluation or approval steps. This may be due to human error, system misconfiguration, or a lack of process enforcement.

4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Hypothesis:** The notification step may be automated and triggered immediately after evaluation, potentially skipping necessary approvals or quality checks. This could lead to premature or incorrect notifications.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

#### 1. Identify Claims with Unusual R  P Time (Receive to Approve)
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS receive_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_between_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'R' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 25*3600 - 2*3600
    OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 25*3600 + 2*3600;
```

#### 2. Identify Claims with Unusual P  N Time (Approve to Notify)
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_between_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'P' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 5*86400 - 2*86400
         OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 5*86400 + 2*86400);
```

#### 3. Identify Claims with Unusual A  C Time (Assign to Close)
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_between_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'A' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 2*3600 - 1*3600
         OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 2*3600 + 1*3600);
```

#### 4. Identify Claims with Unusual E  N Time (Evaluate to Notify)
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_between_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'E' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 5*60 - 1*60
         OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 5*60 + 1*60);
```

#### 5. Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters or Claim Types
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    ce1.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_between_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN 
    claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'R' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 25*3600 - 2*3600
         OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 25*3600 + 2*3600);
```

These queries can be adapted to other activity pairs and can help identify patterns or outliers in the claim handling process.
