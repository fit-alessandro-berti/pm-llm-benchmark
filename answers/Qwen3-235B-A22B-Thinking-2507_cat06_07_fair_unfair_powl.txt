<think>
We are going to create two POWL models as per the description.

First, we note the key activities from the description:
- ReceiveApplication: This would be the initial step where the application is received (including resume and questionnaire). However, note that the description starts with "Applicants first submit their resumes and are then prompted to fill out a detailed questionnaire", so we might consider the initial step as "ReceiveApplication" which includes both.

But note: the process description starts with:
"Applicants first submit their resumes and are then prompted to fill out a detailed questionnaire"

So we can break it down:
- Step 0: ReceiveApplication (which includes resume and then the questionnaire)

However, the POWL model steps we are to use are given in the instructions as:
'ReceiveApplication', 'DataCompletenessCheck', 'RequestMoreInfo', 'SkillAssessment', 'CulturalFitCheck', 'CommunityAffiliationCheck', 'ManagerialReview', 'FinalDecision'

But note the description:

1. Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check:
- This is an automated system that checks for missing info. If missing, it triggers a loop to ask for more info.

So we can model:
- DataCompletenessCheck: which is the check for missing information.
- RequestMoreInfo: the activity that is done in the loop to get the missing info.

The loop structure:
* ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )
But note: the description says "Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding."

Actually, the loop is:
First, we do DataCompletenessCheck. If it fails (i.e., missing info), then we do RequestMoreInfo and then go back to DataCompletenessCheck until it passes.

However, the POWL loop operator is defined as: * (A, B) meaning: execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again.

So we can model the loop as:
* ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )

But note: the DataCompletenessCheck is the condition check. Actually, the loop structure in POWL for such a scenario is:

We have:
A = DataCompletenessCheck (which, if fails, leads to RequestMoreInfo and then back to A)
B = RequestMoreInfo

So the loop is: * ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )

However, note that the DataCompletenessCheck must be done at least once. Then, if it fails, we do RequestMoreInfo and then DataCompletenessCheck again.

2. Preliminary Skill Assessment:
- This is a single activity: SkillAssessment

3. Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check:
- In the first model (with unfairness), we have an XOR branch:
One branch: standard CulturalFitCheck
Other branch: CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives a subtle advantage)

- In the second model (without unfairness), we only have the standard CulturalFitCheck.

4. Managerial Review & Final Decision:
- ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision.

Also note: the description says that after the skill assessment, if the score is below threshold, they are disqualified. But the POWL model we are to create is for the process that continues for those who pass the skill assessment? Actually, the problem states: "Applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified, while those above the threshold proceed."

However, the POWL model we are building is for the process that leads to the final decision (i.e., for the candidates who are not disqualified). But note: the problem says "the process includes loops (to ensure data completeness), XOR choices (to apply different evaluative paths), and sequential ordering of tasks."

We are to model the entire process until the final decision (for the candidates that are not disqualified in the skill assessment). But note: the disqualification in the skill assessment is a hard cutoff. So the process we model is only for those who passed the skill assessment.

Therefore, we assume that the SkillAssessment activity is successful (i.e., the candidate passed) and then we proceed to the next steps.

But note: the problem does not require us to model the disqualification path. We are modeling the process for candidates who are moving forward.

So the steps we model are:
- After the skill assessment (for those who passed), we have the cultural fit step.

Now, let's define the activities:

For both models:

- ReceiveApplication: This is the initial step. However, note that the description says the application is received and then the questionnaire is filled. But the POWL activity "ReceiveApplication" can encompass both.

- Then, we have the loop for data completeness: * ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )

- Then, SkillAssessment (which we assume is passed, so we proceed)

- Then, the cultural fit step (which differs between the two models)

- Then, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But note: the description says that the cultural fit step is where the XOR branch occurs.

Also note: the description says that the process is sequential until the cultural fit step.

So the structure for both models is:

ReceiveApplication -> [loop for data completeness] -> SkillAssessment -> [cultural fit step] -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

However, the loop for data completeness is actually after ReceiveApplication and before SkillAssessment? Let me check:

"Once the basic application data is received:
1. Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: ...
2. Preliminary Skill Assessment"

So the data check (and loop) happens after the application is received and before the skill assessment.

Therefore, the order is:

ReceiveApplication -> * ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo ) -> SkillAssessment -> ...

But note: the DataCompletenessCheck is part of the loop. The loop is:
* ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )

This loop will run until DataCompletenessCheck passes. Then we proceed to SkillAssessment.

Now, for the first model (with unfairness):

After SkillAssessment, we have an XOR branch:

X (
CulturalFitCheck, // standard cultural fit check
CommunityAffiliationCheck // which gives a subtle advantage
)

However, note the description: "either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments."

So the XOR is between two activities:
CulturalFitCheck (for those without the affiliation)
CommunityAffiliationCheck (for those with the affiliation)

But note: the description says that the CommunityAffiliationCheck is triggered by the presence of certain affiliations (like membership in the club or local resident). So the XOR choice is based on the data from the application.

However, in POWL, the XOR is a control flow operator that represents a choice. We don't model the condition (because POWL is about structure, not data). So we just have the XOR between the two activities.

But note: the description says it's an XOR choice in the process. So we model it as an XOR.

Then, after the XOR branch, we have ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

However, note: the ManagerialReview step is described as: "A human reviewer (hiring manager) examines borderline candidates."

So the ManagerialReview might be conditional? But the problem says: "The final decision is then made, either approving the candidate for hire or rejecting them."

We are modeling the process until the final decision. The ManagerialReview is a step that happens for all candidates? Or only for borderline? The description says "borderline candidates", but the process as described seems to have ManagerialReview as a standard step after the cultural fit.

Actually, step 4: "Managerial Review & Final Decision" is described as happening after the cultural fit step.

So we assume that after the cultural fit step (whether standard or the community one), we go to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision.

Therefore, the structure for the first model:

ReceiveApplication
-> * ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )
-> SkillAssessment
-> X ( CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck )
-> ManagerialReview
-> FinalDecision

However, note: the description says that in the ManagerialReview step, the reviewers may view candidates with implicit affiliations more favorably. But the bias is already introduced in the CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives a subtle advantage). The ManagerialReview step might be influenced by that, but we are not modeling the bias in the ManagerialReview step as a separate activity. The bias is already in the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity (which adjusts the score). Then the ManagerialReview step is the same for both.

So we model the CommunityAffiliationCheck as an activity that leads to a higher score (but we don't model the score, just the activity). The unfairness comes from the fact that some candidates take a different path that gives them an advantage.

Therefore, the first model (with unfairness) has the XOR branch.

For the second model (without unfairness):

We remove the CommunityAffiliationCheck branch. So after SkillAssessment, we have only the standard CulturalFitCheck.

Structure:

ReceiveApplication
-> * ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )
-> SkillAssessment
-> CulturalFitCheck
-> ManagerialReview
-> FinalDecision

But note: the problem says "You might still have a loop for data completeness and a sequence for skill checks, but no XOR branch providing selective advantages."

So we are good.

Now, we have to build the POWL models in code as per the pm4py example.

We'll create:

Model 1 (with unfairness):

activities:
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Steps:

1. Loop for data completeness:
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

2. Then, we have a sequence:
After the loop, we do SkillAssessment, then an XOR branch (between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck), then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

How to model the sequence? We use a StrictPartialOrder for the entire process.

The entire process is a sequence of:
ReceiveApplication,
loop,
SkillAssessment,
xor (which is the XOR branch),
ManagerialReview,
FinalDecision

So we create a StrictPartialOrder with these nodes and set the order:
ReceiveApplication -> loop -> SkillAssessment -> xor -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

But note: the loop is a single node (the loop structure). Similarly, the xor is a single node (the XOR structure).

Steps:

Step 1: Create the loop node (for data completeness)
Step 2: Create the XOR node for the cultural fit step (with two children: CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck)
Step 3: Create a StrictPartialOrder with nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
Step 4: Set the order:
ReceiveApplication -> loop
loop -> SkillAssessment
SkillAssessment -> xor
xor -> ManagerialReview
ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

However, note: the ReceiveApplication activity must happen first, then the loop, etc.

Model 2 (without unfairness):

Instead of the XOR, we have a single CulturalFitCheck activity.

So:

nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

And the order is the same sequence.

But note: the problem says that in the second model, we remove the XOR branch. So we don't have the CommunityAffiliationCheck at all.

Implementation:

We'll create two separate POWL models.

Let's code accordingly.

Important: The POWL model must be a StrictPartialOrder at the top level? Actually, the example given in the instructions uses a StrictPartialOrder as the root.

However, note the example:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

So we will build a StrictPartialOrder that contains all the top-level nodes (which are the activities and the operator nodes).

Steps for Model 1:

Step 1: Define all the transition activities (with labels).
Step 2: Create the loop node for the data completeness check.
Step 3: Create the XOR node for the cultural fit step (with two children: CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck).
Step 4: Create a StrictPartialOrder with nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
Step 5: Add the order edges:
ReceiveApplication -> loop
loop -> SkillAssessment
SkillAssessment -> xor
xor -> ManagerialReview
ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

Steps for Model 2:

Step 1: Same activities (but without CommunityAffiliationCheck, but we don't use it in the model).
Step 2: Create the loop node (same as model1).
Step 3: Instead of XOR, we have a single activity: CulturalFitCheck (so no operator node for the cultural fit step, it's just a transition).
Step 4: Create a StrictPartialOrder with nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
Step 5: Add the order edges:
ReceiveApplication -> loop
loop -> SkillAssessment
SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck
CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview
ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

However, note: the CulturalFitCheck in model2 is a single activity, so we don't need an operator for it.

But wait: the problem says "all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process". So it's a single activity.

Let's code accordingly.

Note: In model1, the cultural fit step is represented by an XOR operator node (which has two children). In model2, it's a single transition.

We'll now write the code for both models.

We assume we are to output the code that constructs the two models.

But note: the problem says "produce two POWL models", meaning we are to write the code that builds them.

We'll write two separate code blocks.

However, note: the problem says "You can use an approach similar to the example given in the instructions".

So we'll write the code as in the example.

Let's do it.

First, import the necessary modules.

Note: We are to use the classes from pm4py.objects.powl.obj.

But since we are only writing the model structure (and not running it), we can write the code as if we were in a Python script.

We'll write:

For Model 1 (with unfairness):

import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create the loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Create the XOR for cultural fit step
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Create the root partial order
nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add order edges
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

For Model 2 (without unfairness):

# Same activities as above, but we don't use CommunityAffiliationCheck in the model.

# Define activities (same as above, but we don't need to define CommunityAffiliationCheck for the model, but we can skip it)
# However, we'll define only the ones we use.

ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create the loop for data completeness (same as model1)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# In model2, we don't have an XOR, so we use CulturalFitCheck as a single activity.

# Create the root partial order
nodes = [ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add order edges
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

But note: the problem says that the second model should have no special community-based branch. We have achieved that by having only one cultural fit activity.

However, note: the description of the second model says "all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process". So we are using the same activity label "CulturalFitCheck" for all.

This is correct.

One more note: the problem says that the first model has the XOR branch that can create an unfair tilt. We have included the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity which is the biased branch.

Therefore, we have met the requirements.

Let's write the code for both models as requested.
</think>

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model includes an XOR branch after the skill assessment that introduces bias through the `CommunityAffiliationCheck` activity. Applicants with specific affiliations (e.g., "Global Business Leaders Club" membership or local residency) take this path, receiving a subtle advantage not available to others.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities from the process description
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Biased branch
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# 1. Data completeness loop: * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[
    DataCompletenessCheck, 
    RequestMoreInfo
])

# 2. XOR branch for cultural fit evaluation (bias point)
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    CulturalFitCheck,  # Standard path
    CommunityAffiliationCheck  # Biased path (gives implicit uplift)
])

# Root workflow: Sequential order with XOR branch
nodes = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    cultural_fit_xor,  # Unfair XOR choice here
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Enforce sequential execution order
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_xor)  # Leads to biased branch
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Key Unfairness Mechanism**:  
The `cultural_fit_xor` node creates an exclusive choice where applicants with privileged affiliations enter the `CommunityAffiliationCheck` path. This activity implicitly adjusts scores in their favor (e.g., through subjective "cultural alignment" interpretations), violating fairness. The bias propagates to `ManagerialReview`, where reviewers may unconsciously favor these candidates.

---

### POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model eliminates the biased XOR branch. All applicants undergo the **identical** `CulturalFitCheck` activity, ensuring equitable treatment. No community-based advantages exist.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities (no CommunityAffiliationCheck)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Single standard path
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# 1. Data completeness loop: * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[
    DataCompletenessCheck, 
    RequestMoreInfo
])

# Root workflow: Strict sequence with NO XOR branch
nodes = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,  # Only one path for all
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Enforce sequential execution order
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)  # Uniform evaluation
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Key Fairness Improvements**:  
- **No XOR branch**: The `CulturalFitCheck` activity is mandatory for all applicants, removing preferential paths.  
- **Standardized evaluation**: Cultural fit is assessed using consistent criteria (e.g., structured interviews/scoring rubrics), eliminating subjective "implicit uplifts" for affiliated candidates.  
- **Bias prevention**: The `ManagerialReview` step now operates on uniformly evaluated data, reducing unconscious bias risks.

### Critical Differences Highlighting Fairness
| **Element**               | **Unfair Model**                                     | **Fair Model**                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Cultural Fit Step**     | XOR branch (`CulturalFitCheck` OR `CommunityAffiliationCheck`) | Single `CulturalFitCheck` activity for all       |
| **Bias Mechanism**        | `CommunityAffiliationCheck` gives implicit advantages to privileged groups | No activity provides affiliation-based advantages |
| **Process Transparency**  | Opaque: Applicants unaware why some skip standard checks | Transparent: Identical steps for all candidates   |
| **Managerial Review**     | Biased input (some candidates pre-advantaged)        | Unbiased input (uniform evaluation data)          |

> **Why this fixes unfairness**: The fair model removes the *structural opportunity* for bias by eliminating the exclusive path that privileged applicants exploit. All candidates now face identical evaluation criteria at every stage, aligning with the principle of "fair process" in hiring.
