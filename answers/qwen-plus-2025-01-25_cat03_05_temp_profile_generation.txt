Below is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process described in the scenario. The dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs, capturing both direct and indirect relationships between activities. The average times and standard deviations are estimated based on typical delays and variability expected in such processes.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 17280),  # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: ~1 day avg, ±0.5 days std dev
    ('SS', 'RC'): (345600, 43200), # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: ~4 days avg, ±12 hours std dev
    ('SS', 'QI'): (432000, 57600), # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection: ~5 days avg, ±16 hours std dev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (259200, 36000), # Order Placement to Receive Components: ~3 days avg, ±1 day std dev
    ('OP', 'CA'): (604800, 72000), # Order Placement to Component Assembly: ~7 days avg, ±2 days std dev
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 17280),  # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: ~1 day avg, ±0.5 days std dev
    ('RC', 'PK'): (1209600, 144000), # Receive Components to Packaging: ~14 days avg, ±4 days std dev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 25920), # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: ~2 days avg, ±0.75 days std dev
    ('QI', 'WS'): (1814400, 259200), # Quality Inspection to Warehouse Storage: ~21 days avg, ±7 days std dev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 36000), # Component Assembly to Product Testing: ~3 days avg, ±1 day std dev
    ('CA', 'DT'): (2160000, 345600), # Component Assembly to Distribution: ~25 days avg, ±10 days std dev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 17280),  # Product Testing to Packaging: ~1 day avg, ±0.5 days std dev
    ('PK', 'WS'): (172800, 25920), # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: ~2 days avg, ±0.75 days std dev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (604800, 120960), # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: ~7 days avg, ±3 days std dev
    ('WS', 'AS'): (2419200, 432000), # Warehouse Storage to After-Sales Support: ~28 days avg, ±12 days std dev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 17280)   # Distribution to After-Sales Support: ~1 day avg, ±0.5 days std dev
}

### Explanation of Estimations:
1. **Direct Relationships**: 
   - For directly connected activities (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')` or `('RC', 'QI')`), the average time reflects the typical delay between these steps, with standard deviation accounting for variability due to external factors like supplier lead times or inspection complexity.
   
2. **Indirect Relationships**:
   - For indirectly connected activities (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')` or `('OP', 'CA')`), the average time incorporates the cumulative delays of intermediate steps. The standard deviation increases as more steps are involved, reflecting compounded variability.

3. **Long-Term Dependencies**:
   - Activities far apart in the process (e.g., `('SS', 'WS')` or `('OP', 'DT')`) have longer average times and higher standard deviations, capturing the extended durations and uncertainties across multiple stages.

This dictionary provides a comprehensive temporal profile for the global supply chain process, enabling anomaly detection and performance analysis by comparing observed times against these averages and thresholds.
