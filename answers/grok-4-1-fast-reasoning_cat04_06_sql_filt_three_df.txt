## Explanation

This query systematically identifies and excludes events from cases meeting both the specified sequence and timing criteria:

1. **ordered_events CTE**: Assigns a row number (`rn`) to each event within every `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp ASC`. This establishes the chronological sequence of events per case.

2. **potential_bad_sequences CTE**: Filters to events where the current activity is `'Approve Purchase Requisition'` (potential start of the sequence). Uses `LEAD` window functions to peek at the next two activities (`act2`, `act3`) and timestamps (`ts2`, `ts3`) in the sequence. This efficiently checks for direct succession without self-joins.

3. **bad_cases CTE**: Identifies "bad" cases by selecting distinct `case_id`s where:
   - The subsequent activities exactly match `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'`.
   - Both `ts2` and `ts3` are non-null (ensuring the full triplet exists).
   - The time difference `ts3 - ts2 > INTERVAL '5' DAY` (DuckDB interval syntax for more than 5 days).

4. **Main Query**: Returns all columns (`*`) from `event_log` for cases not in `bad_cases`. Includes `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` for a deterministic, readable result set ordered by case and event chronology.

This approach ensures only cases with **at least one** qualifying sequence (direct succession + >5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order') are excluded entirely, while returning all events from all other cases. It handles multiple sequences per case correctly by using `DISTINCT case_id`.
