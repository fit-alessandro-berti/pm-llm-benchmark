**Notes/Ambiguities:**

*   The time AP waits for receipt confirmation (Task 7) is unclear.
*   The exact flow after a rejected invoice (Task 16) is not detailed.
*   The Purchasing Officer (Dan) confirms details *before* the Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) matches the invoice, but the timing of this confirmation relative to logging the invoice is slightly ambiguous.
*   The Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is involved in resolving discrepancies but doesn't directly participate in the core process flow. Their involvement is triggered by issues identified by AP or Purchasing.
*   The interviews suggest a system-driven flow with automatic notifications, but the specifics of the system are not detailed.
