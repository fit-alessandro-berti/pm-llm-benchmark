The visualization depicts a flowchart illustrating a decision-making process related to handling requests. 

### Main Flowchart:
- **Nodes & Actions**: Each node in the flowchart represents a step or action, labeled with phrases like "register request," "examine thoroughly," "examine casually," "check ticket," "decide," "pay compensation," "reject request," and "end."
- **Flow**: The arrows between nodes indicate the flow of the process. The initial step starts with "register request" (node a), which leads to several examination options (nodes b and c). Depending on the decisions made at each examination stage, the process can branch out towards either checking the ticket (node d) or reinitiating the request (node f) before culminating in either paying compensation (node g) or rejecting the request (node h) before ending the process (node z).

### Subsection:
- **Join and Split Types**: At the bottom, there are symbols representing different types of splits and joins in the process:
  - **XOR-split**: Indicates a choice between paths.
  - **AND-split**: Indicates parallel actions occurring simultaneously.
  - **OR-split**: Similar to XOR, but multiple paths can be taken.
  - **XOR-join, AND-join, OR-join**: These indicate how multiple paths converge back into a single flow, maintaining the properties defined.

Overall, this visualization serves to clarify the sequence of operations and decisions in the request processing system, along with the mechanisms for branching and converging flows in business processes.
