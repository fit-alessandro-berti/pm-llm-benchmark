The provided visualization appears to be a flowchart illustrating a process related to handling requests. Here's a breakdown of the components:

### Main Flowchart
- **Nodes**: The main flowchart consists of several labeled nodes that represent stages in the process. The specific labels include:
  - **a**: "register request" — the starting point of the process.
  - **b**: "examine thoroughly" — a detailed examination step.
  - **c**: "examine casually" — a less rigorous examination.
  - **d**: "check ticket" — a verification step.
  - **e**: "decide" — a decision-making point.
  - **f**: "reinitiate request" — a step to restart the request process if needed.
  - **g**: "pay compensation" — a step for compensating the requester.
  - **h**: "reject request" — a step for denying the request.
  - **z**: "end" — the termination point of the process.

- **Arrows**: The arrows connecting the nodes indicate the flow of the process, showing how one step leads to another based on outcomes or decisions made at each stage.

### Additional Diagrams
- In the bottom section, various types of process splits and joins are illustrated:
  - **XOR-split**: Represents a choice where one and only one path can be taken.
  - **AND-split**: Indicates a situation where multiple paths are taken simultaneously.
  - **OR-split**: Suggests that at least one of several paths may be chosen.
  - **XOR-join**: Where only one incoming flow is allowed at this node.
  - **AND-join**: Indicates that all incoming flows must be satisfied to proceed.
  - **OR-join**: Means that if at least one incoming flow is satisfied, the process can continue.

Overall, the visualization effectively outlines a procedural flow for request management, detailing decision points and possible outcomes, along with various split and join mechanisms commonly used in process modeling.
