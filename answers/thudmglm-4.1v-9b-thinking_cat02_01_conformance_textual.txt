<answer>To address the task, we first analyze the **normative process** rules and then evaluate each case in the event log for violations.  


### Step 1: Understand Normative Process Rules  
From the textual description, the key rules are:  
1. **Order Flow for Sufficient Inventory**:  
   *Receive*  *Check Inventory*  *Authorize Payment*  *Package Items*  *Ship Order*  *Close Order*  
   - *Rationale*: "Authorize payment" must come before "Package items", and "Ship order" must come after "Package items".  

2. **Order Flow for Insufficient Inventory**:  
   *Receive*  *Check Inventory*  *Cancel Order*  *Close Order*  
   - *Rationale*: "Ship order" or "Package items" should not occur after a "Cancel order", and "Authorize payment" should not happen if inventory is insufficient.  

3. **Final Activity**: *Close order* must be the last activity.  


### Step 2: Evaluate Each Case for Violations  
We check each case’s activity sequence against the rules above.  


#### Case 1  
Sequence: *Receive  Check Inventory  Authorize Payment  Package Items  Ship Order  Close Order*  
- Follows the "sufficient inventory" flow (all rules are satisfied: Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close).  
- **No violation**.  


#### Case 2  
Sequence: *Receive  Check Inventory  Package Items  Authorize Payment  Ship Order  Close Order*  
- Violates the rule that *Authorize Payment* must occur **before** *Package Items* (here, Package comes before Authorize).  
- **Violates normative process**.  


#### Case 3  
Sequence: *Receive  Check Inventory  Authorize Payment  Cancel Order  Ship Order  Close Order*  
- Two violations:  
  1. *Ship Order* occurs **after** *Cancel Order* (the normative process prohibits shipping after cancellation).  
  2. *Authorize Payment* occurs before *Cancel Order*, implying authorization when inventory is insufficient (which should not happen).  
- **Violates normative process**.  


#### Case 4  
Sequence: *Receive  Check Inventory  Cancel Order  Close Order*  
- Follows the "insufficient inventory" flow (all rules are satisfied).  
- **No violation**.  


#### Case 5  
Sequence: *Receive  Check Inventory  Authorize Payment  Ship Order  Close Order*  
- Violates the rule that *Package Items* must occur **before** *Ship Order* (here, Ship occurs without Package).  
- **Violates normative process**.  


### Final Answer  
The cases violating the normative process are **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**. Here’s the breakdown of violations:  

1. **Case 2**:  
   The sequence *Package Items  Authorize Payment* violates the rule requiring *Authorize Payment* before *Package Items*.  

2. **Case 3**:  
   The sequence *Cancel Order  Ship Order* and *Authorize Payment  Cancel Order* violate the rules: (1) shipping cannot occur after cancellation; (2) authorization is unnecessary when inventory is insufficient.  

3. **Case 5**:  
   The sequence *Authorize Payment  Ship Order* (without *Package Items*) violates the rule requiring *Package Items* before *Ship Order*.
