Based on the provided event logs expressing a sequence of activities across multiple cases and orders, we model the process as a **Partially Ordered Workflow (POWL)** using:

- **SilentTransition** as implicit "no operation" transitions between events;
- **Transition** with labels as explicit process steps;
- **OperatorPOWL** with **X (XOR)** for exclusive choices between paths (simultaneous or mutually exclusive choices);
- **OperatorPOWL** with **\* (Loop)** for repeating subprocesses until a condition (implied by path completion) — applied in **AS (Assembly)** as a candidate repetitive path, though behavioral looping is not explicitly forced;  
- **StrictPartialOrder** to define the dependency ordering: before a step in a case can finalize, upstream subtasks (across different cases) must complete.

---

### Assumptions:
- Label ambiguity (e.g., identical "AS" with no differing node intent) presents concurrent execution unless ordered.
- **IQC** and **RT** occur only once per node; model as repeats only if explicitly recurring — here treated as single nested paths.
- **LB** is skipped in Case 2 and Case 4, treated as optional.
- Re-Testing (RT) after failure implies looping back from testing to testing: modeled as a loop **(*)** from **TST** to **TST**.
- Packaging (PK) and labeling (LB) are activities but no choice or loop; they appear sequentially; **no partial order constraint** unless nesting — none detected.
- **AS (Assembly)** shows repeated intelligence checks, but without clear iteration pattern — modeled linearly; hygienic to apply ordered **\* only if recurrence pattern exists. Here, no iterative trigger — omit loop.

### POWL Model Construction

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions:
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC_1 = Transition(label="IQC_1")  # first screening per case (unique per node)
IQC_2 = Transition(label="IQC_2")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

# * loop from TST back to TST: re-Testing after initial fail (or retry logic implied)
# But since no error flag is present, treat as path splitting with loop *(TST --> TST), ignoring RT strictly here  omit loop *(for now, RT is linear end)*
# Actually RT occurs *after* TST — if TST failure triggers RT, then the path branches:
# TST  RT  TST  RT  TST ...  so loop TST --> TST at RT
loop_tst_rt = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, TST])  # re-run TST and RT paths

# XOR choices: Cases 1 and 2 both trigger AS-like paths but downstream IQC paths diverge  but no actual choice in sequence.
# However, Case 1 and 2 share OR  MS  QS  AS — XOR symmetry not strong here. But between OR/MS, no conflict  just sequential.
# No forced choice — hence no XOR; all paths are linear per case.  
# If instead two mutually exclusive post-OR branches existed, use X. Not here. So X is omitted unless more contrast.

# Silent transitions between events — implicit in workflow graph; no explicit label needed.

# Define StrictPartialOrder:
# All NODE1 (OR, MS, QS) instances are independent  run concurrent  
# MS depends on OR (no pre condition), AS depends on MS and QS (both upstream)  
# PK and DP depend on AS (serial), D follows — all downstream  
# Strict order:  
# OR --> MS --> QS  
# MS  AS  
# QS  AS  
# AS  PK  DP  D

nodes = {OR, MS, QS, AS, TST, PK, DP, D}

# Add edges to define partial order:

order_edges = [
    OR.order.add_edge(MS),
    OR.order.add_edge(QS),
    MS.order.add_edge(AS),
    QS.order.add_edge(AS),
    AS.order.add_edge(PK),
    PK.order.add_edge(DP),
    DP.order.add_edge(D),
    # MS and QS have no mutual precedence  no edge
    # OR ends at TST, MS/QS  AS  deeper, so no explicit cross:
    # Since MS and QS run concurrently, no order constraint — safe to leave concurrent
    # TST followed by RT then TST, then RT — RT is post TST, re-test path, ends at TST
    # This RT path is exclusive: RT  TST, so RT must complete before next RT, but RT feeds back to TST
    # So: TST — RT — TST — RT  ... — loop:
    # TST.order.add_edge(loop_tst_rt, TST) ??? But loop is *TST*  *TST*, so TST depends on itself

    # Instead, loop *TST*  *TST* meaning: from end of TST (DT), go back to TST (as input) to retest
    # So recursive loop: **loop_tst_rt** from TST -> TST, enforcing repeat after failure

    # Make TST depend on loop_tst_rt: the deferred TST means reassessment — so order edge from loop_tst_rt  TST (completion triggering re-test run)

    # Let’s refine:

    loop_tst_rt.order.add_edge(TST)  # TST is output/end, looping back to TST input  requires looping via ##TST  TST## (labeled as loop_tst_rt)

    # Also: D follows DP, DP after AS; no constraint between D and earlier paths

    # Now build final StrictPartialOrder instance:

    root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)
    root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
    root.order.add_edge(OR, QS)
    root.order.add_edge(MS, AS)
    root.order.add_edge(QS, AS)
    root.order.add_edge(AS, PK)
    root.order.add_edge(PK, DP)
    root.order.add_edge(DP, D)

    root.order.add_edge(TST, loop_tst_rt)   # TST path loops through RT  TST

    # Optional: MS and QS share OR input, but no forward dependency; mutual exclusivity not warranted  concurrent

return root
```

### Final POWL Model Summary

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(OR, QS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, AS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, AS)
root.order.add_edge(AS, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
root.order.add_edge(TST, loop_tst_rt)

# Note: No XOR used because no mutually exclusive branching paths; choices are linear per case without conflict
# Silent transitions omit explicit labels; RT triggers loop back to TST execution point.
```

This model captures:
- Concurrency between OR  MS  QS instances across case IDs.
- Sequential dependencies: before AS runs, MS and QS finish.
- AS depends on MS and QS simultaneously.
- Test cycles **TST  RT  TST** looped via **loop_tst_rt**, capturing retest feedback.
- Packaging and labeling occur linearly after Assembly.
- No forced choice (XOR) since no explicit mutually exclusive later branching.

The partial order `PO` expresses concurrency near OR/MS/QS and seriality in Assembly, with a single feedback loop reinforcing testing reliability.
