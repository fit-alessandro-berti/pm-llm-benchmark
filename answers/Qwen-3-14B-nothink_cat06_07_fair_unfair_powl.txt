Here are two **POWL models** that reflect the hiring process at **GlobalTeq Solutions**, with the key difference being the **presence or absence of the biased community affiliation branch**.

---

##  **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model includes the **XOR branch** that introduces a potential bias by giving a slight advantage to applicants with community affiliations.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR branch for cultural fit or community affiliation
cultural_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the managerial review and final decision
managerial_review = ManagerialReview
final_decision = FinalDecision

# Build the strict partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_completeness_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    cultural_choice,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Add the partial order constraints
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_choice)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_choice, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# This model has the biased XOR branch: CulturalFitCheck vs CommunityAffiliationCheck
```

###  Explanation:
- The **loop** ensures that the application data is complete.
- The **SkillAssessment** is mandatory.
- The **XOR choice** introduces a **biased path**:
  - One path leads to **CulturalFitCheck** (standard).
  - The other path leads to **CommunityAffiliationCheck**, which may **subtly uplift** the score for local or affiliated applicants.
- This **XOR branch** is the **source of potential unfairness**.

##  **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This model removes the **biased XOR branch** and ensures **all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation**.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the cultural fit check (only one path)
cultural_check = CulturalFitCheck

# Define the managerial review and final decision
managerial_review = ManagerialReview
final_decision = FinalDecision

# Build the strict partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_completeness_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Add the partial order constraints
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# This model has no biased XOR branch; all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck
```

###  Explanation:
- The **loop** ensures that the application data is complete.
- The **SkillAssessment** is mandatory.
- **All applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck** (no biased branch).
- The **ManagerialReview** and **FinalDecision** are the same as in the first model, but with **no unfair advantage** from affiliation checks.
