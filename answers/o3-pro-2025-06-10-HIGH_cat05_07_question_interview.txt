Targeted, open-ended clarification questions

Initial contact & intake  
1. Through which channels (phone, web form, referral, etc.) do landlords typically approach you, and does the intake process differ by channel?  
2. What specific service-level or response-time goals do you aim for between the landlord’s first inquiry and the coordinator’s initial follow-up?  
3. What criteria help you decide whether a property is accepted into the portfolio or politely declined at this very first stage?

Documentation & compliance  
4. How do you decide which documents are deemed “current” or “outdated,” and who sets those standards?  
5. What happens if a landlord cannot supply a required document—do you assist them in obtaining it, or is the onboarding paused?  
6. Are there city- or state-specific compliance rules that change the documentation package, and if so, how is the coordinator alerted to those variations?  
7. Is there an internal checklist or gate that must be fully satisfied before the next step can begin, or can some tasks proceed in parallel?

Data capture  
8. Which data points are mandatory versus “nice to have” when the coordinator enters property details into the central database?  
9. How do you ensure data accuracy—do you use dual entry, automated validation, or later audits?

Assigning a property manager  
10. Can you describe the weighting or decision logic behind workload, geography, experience, and landlord requirements when choosing a manager?  
11. How often do you rebalance a manager’s portfolio if their workload changes after the initial assignment?  
12. Who has the final authority to approve or override a manager assignment?

Introductory meeting  
13. What specific outputs (e.g., summary of agreed policies, action items) are expected from the landlord–manager kickoff meeting, and where are they stored?  
14. How do you handle disagreements at this stage—for instance, if a landlord wants a pet policy the company usually avoids?

Photography, inspection & remediation  
15. What is the average lead time to schedule photographers and inspectors, and what factors cause delays?  
16. Who bears the cost of inspections and any required repairs?  
17. How do you track open remediation tasks, and what triggers a re-inspection?  
18. Are there conditions under which a property will be rejected entirely after inspection, and who makes that call?

Marketing & pricing  
19. Which teams or roles sign off on the final listing content and pricing before it goes live?  
20. How frequently are pricing models refreshed during the onboarding cycle, and can a landlord veto suggested price changes?  
21. If marketing assets are delayed, can the property still move forward in other streams, or is the entire process gated?

Activation & listing go-live  
22. What checklist determines that a property is “activated” in the portal, and who has the authority to flip that switch?  
23. Do you conduct any soft-launch or internal testing of the listing before it becomes publicly visible?

Tenant screening & lease negotiation  
24. How do you balance objective screening criteria with landlord preferences while staying within fair-housing laws?  
25. When multiple qualified applicants exist, what factors (lease length, move-in date, discount offers) tip the decision?  
26. Who drafts and approves any custom lease clauses requested by landlords or tenants?

Quality checks & internal audits  
27. How often do compliance officers and financial analysts perform their reviews—per property, weekly batches, or ad hoc?  
28. What happens if a late audit flags a problem after the lease is already signed?  
29. How does the IT team validate that listing data and financial fields are integrated correctly—manual spot checks or automated scripts?

Exception handling  
30. Could you share examples of exceptional cases (e.g., heritage buildings, student dorms) and how the standard workflow was adapted?  
31. What governance or escalation path exists when multiple exceptions occur simultaneously?

Communication & tools  
32. Which parts of the process rely primarily on email versus your CRM or project-management platform, and how do you avoid information silos?  
33. How is a single source of truth maintained for status updates when several stakeholders are interacting in parallel?

Timing, metrics & continuous improvement  
34. What is your average end-to-end onboarding duration, and which stages most often exceed their target time?  
35. Which KPIs or feedback loops (landlord satisfaction, vacancy days, compliance errors) drive process improvements?  
36. How do you capture lessons learned from completed onboardings and feed them back into training or SOP updates?

Post-onboarding handoff  
37. Once the tenant has moved in, how is responsibility formally transferred from the onboarding team to ongoing property management and maintenance teams?  
38. Are there follow-up checkpoints (e.g., 30-day quality audit) to confirm the onboarding was successful?

Scalability & regional variation  
39. How does this workflow change for high-volume seasons or new cities where you may lack an established vendor network?  
40. What future enhancements—automation, policy changes, additional roles—are you considering to streamline or scale the onboarding process further?
