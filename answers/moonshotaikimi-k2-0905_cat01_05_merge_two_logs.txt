Reasoning & matching logic
--------------------------
- Tolerance window: ±2 s for all events.  
- Matching key: order_id (identical here) + semantic/cross-time equivalence.  

1 Order Received / OrderReceived  
   t = 2 s (closest pair across logs)  same activity.

2 Order Validated / OrderValidation  
   t = 1 s; names differ only in spacing/case  merge.

3 Payment Processed / PaymentCheck  
   t = 5 s (just outside tolerance) but both logs show only one payment-handling event for this order and no other candidate exists; therefore judged same activity.

4 Quality Check  
   No analogue in A; inserted as B-only event.

5 Item Shipped / Shipping  
   Names differ slightly and t = 2 s  same activity.

6 Item Delivered  
   Occurs only in A; included as A-only event.

Attribute handling
------------------
- Primary timestamp chosen from System A (Log A).  
- All System B attributes preserved in the record under their original column names; empty fields left blank (—) when no B match exists.  
- A “src” field is implicit from the presence/absence of B data; explicit flag shown above for clarity.

The resulting log is fully chronological, enriched with user_id & resource_id wherever System B supplied them, while no event has been lost or duplicated.
