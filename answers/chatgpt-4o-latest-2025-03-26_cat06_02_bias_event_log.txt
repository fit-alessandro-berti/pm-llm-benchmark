**Bias Analysis of the Event Log**

The event log demonstrates **systematic biases** affecting the fairness and equity of application outcomes. By comparing how similar applicants are treated differently due to **non-performance-related attributes**, the following patterns emerge:

---

###  **Key Bias Indicators Identified:**

---

## 1. **Community Group Membership Bias**

###  Observation:
Applicants affiliated with the **"Highland Civic Darts Club"** receive a **+10 score adjustment** during the **PreliminaryScoring** step.

- **Case C001**: Starts with 710  adjusted to 720
- **Case C004**: Starts with 690  adjusted to 700
- **All other cases with no community group** receive **0 adjustment**

###  Implication:

- The adjustment influences the **final outcomes**, particularly for **borderline approval cases** such as C004.
- Case C004 was approved due to this +10 adjustment. Without it, at 690, it may have been rejected under the same rules used for similar non-local cases.

###  Bias Type:  
**Group Affiliation Bias / Favoritism Toward Specific Organizations**

###  Effect:
- Applicants not connected to a community group (e.g., C002 and C005) do not receive this benefit—even when they have strong scores.
- This introduces **inequity**, especially if group membership is not an objective indicator of creditworthiness or reliability.

---

## 2. **Local Residency Bias**

###  Observation:
All **non-local applicants (LocalResident = FALSE)** receive **no positive scoring adjustment**, and in one case (C003) with a decent score (715), were **rejected**, although a local applicant with **lower initial score (690  700)** was **approved** (C004).

- **C003**: Not local, no group, score 715  Rejected
- **C004**: Local, in group, adjusted score 700  Approved

###  Implication:

- Approval thresholds appear unequal:
  - Local applicants may be approved with lower scores due to adjustments.
  - Non-locals, even with higher scores, are rejected (C003 vs. C004).

###  Bias Type:
**Geographic Bias / Local Resident Preference**

###  Effect:

- Penalizes equally or better-qualified non-local applicants.
- Undermines consistency: approval should reflect applicant reliability, not geography.

---

## 3. **Bias in Score Adjustment Policies**

###  Observation:
All score adjustments are based **solely** on **CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"** (which correlates with being local as well). No one else receives any form of adjustment.

###  Implication:

- Non-group members are structurally disadvantaged.
- Score adjustments are not based on individual merit, risk, or financial data.

###  Bias Type:
**Structural Favoritism / Algorithmic Bias Due to Manual Rule Weighting**

###  Effect:

- Increases risk of favoring subjective factors over measurable fairness.
- Potentially excludes minorities, newcomers, or outsiders from approvals due to lack of embedded local connections.

#  Summary of Bias and Impacts

| **Bias Type**             | **Source Attribute**        | **Favored Group**              | **Disadvantaged Group**                     | **Impact on Fairness**                                          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Community Affiliation     | `CommunityGroup`            | Members of Highland Darts Club | Applicants without community memberships     | Preferential score boosts impacting final decisions              |
| Geographic Bias           | `LocalResident`             | Local residents                | Applicants outside the local jurisdiction    | Better chances of approval at equal or even lower base scores    |
| Opaque Score Adjustments  | `ScoreAdjustment` rules     | Those covered under rules      | Those not mapped to benefit rules            | Penalizes good-score applicants unfairly                          |

#  Recommendations to Improve Fairness:

1. **Review Score Adjustment Criteria**:
   - Base scoring strictly on **objective risk indicators** — not affiliations.

2. **Audit Rule Engine Logic**:
   - Ensure that **thresholds** for approval are applied consistently regardless of geographic or social indicators.

3. **Transparency in Adjustments**:
   - Applicants should understand what factors contribute to score changes and decisions.

4. **Introduce Bias Checks**:
   - Run fairness audits using tools to assess **disparate impact** across demographics.

5. **Diversify Adjustment Schemes**:
   - If non-technical traits are to be considered (e.g., community involvement), apply them **equitably** across varied groups, or use more inclusive eligibility criteria.

 **Conclusion**:

This event log highlights a scoring and decision framework where **subjective and potentially discriminatory attributes**—like local affiliation or group membership—directly affect outcomes. To ensure equity and transparency, the scoring system should be redesigned to prioritize **merit-based**, **data-driven** assessments that treat all applicants on equal footing.
