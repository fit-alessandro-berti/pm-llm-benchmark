Perfect — this is a classic "process mining without case ID" problem.  
We need to reconstruct the **patient journeys** (cases) based on matching attributes: `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, order of events, and medical logic.

### Step 1. Identify distinct potential patients
Looking across registration events (the natural case starts):

1. **Case A**: Registered at `08:05:13`, ER, age 45, male  
2. **Case B**: Registered at `08:07:02`, ER, age 62, female  
3. **Case C**: Registered at `08:07:15`, Surgery, age 28, male  

So, we expect **3 cases total**.

### Step 2. Assign subsequent events to appropriate patients

#### **Case A (ER, 45M, private insurance)**
- (1) Register patient (08:05:13)  
- (4) Initial triage by Nurse Joy (08:10:50), age 45M  
- (7) X-ray imaging, Radiology, same age/gender (08:15:42)  
- (12) Doctor consultation, Dr. Lee, ER, 45M, diagnosis=hairline fracture (08:23:10)  
- (15) Patient discharged, ER, 45M, follow-up outpatient clinic (08:30:05)  

**Case A sequence:** Register  Triage  Imaging  Consultation  Discharge

---

#### **Case B (ER, 62F, public insurance)**
- (2) Register patient (08:07:02)  
- (5) Initial triage, Nurse Mark, ER, 62F (08:12:29)  
- (8) Lab test requested by Dr. Smith (08:16:10)  
- (10) Lab test completed (08:20:27)  
- (11) Doctor consultation, ER, Dr. Smith, diagnosis=minor infection (08:22:54)  
- (14) Prescription created, ER, antibiotics (08:27:00)  
- (17) Patient discharged, ER, follow-up pharmacy pickup (08:35:29)  

**Case B sequence:** Register  Triage  Lab request  Lab complete  Consultation  Prescription  Discharge  

---

#### **Case C (Surgery, 28M, private insurance)**
- (3) Register patient (08:07:15), Surgery  
- (6) Doctor consultation, Dr. Lee, Surgery, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery (08:13:00)  
- (9) Surgery preparation, Surgical Nurse (08:16:45)  
- (13) Surgery performed, Dr. Lee (08:25:19)  
- (16) Recovery room, condition stable (08:31:37)  
- (18) Patient discharged, Surgery, follow-up physiotherapy sessions (08:40:13)  

**Case C sequence:** Register  Consultation  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge  

---

### Step 3. Summarize reconstructed cases

 **Case A (ER, 45M, private)**  
Events: 1  4  7  12  15  

 **Case B (ER, 62F, public)**  
Events: 2  5  8  10  11  14  17  

 **Case C (Surgery, 28M, private)**  
Events: 3  6  9  13  16  18  

---

### Final Answer (Grouping by inferred Case ID)

- **Case A (ER patient, 45M):** Events [1, 4, 7, 12, 15]  
- **Case B (ER patient, 62F):** Events [2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17]  
- **Case C (Surgery patient, 28M):** Events [3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18]

Would you like me to take the next step and **draw a visual event timeline / process model** for these 3 patient cases (like a sequence flow diagram), so you can more easily see the separation?
