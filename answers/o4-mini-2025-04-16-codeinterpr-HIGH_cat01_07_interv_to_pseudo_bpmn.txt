Below is a BPMN-style, textual description of the “Invoice Approval” process, distilled from the five interviews.  You can hand this off to a modeller to draw the Pools, Lanes, Tasks, Gateways, Data Objects and Sequence Flows.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
Process Name: Invoice Approval  
Pools & Lanes:  
  • AP Department  
    – Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
    – Lane: Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
  • Purchasing Department  
    – Lane: Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
  • Management  
    – Lane: Department Manager (Carlos)  
  • Supplier  
    – Lane: Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
  • System (ERP/email automation)  

Data Objects:  
  • Invoice  
  • Purchase Order (PO)  
  • Goods Receipt Confirmation  
  • Discrepancy Report / Clarification Request  
  • Retrospective PO  
  • Approval Request / Notification  

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
1. Start Event  
   – “Invoice Arrives” (email or paper)  
   – Performer: AP Clerk  

2. Exclusive Gateway [G1]: “Invoice linked to valid PO?”  
   Condition A (Yes)  Step 3  
   Condition B (No)  Step 2a  

2a. Exception Path: Missing PO  
   2a-1. Task: “Request PO number/details from Supplier”  
          – Performer: AP Clerk (may loop in Supplier Relationship Manager)  
   2a-2. Intermediate Catch: “Supplier provides PO or declines”  
   2a-3. Exclusive Gateway [G1] (re-evaluate)  
   Note:  
     • If invoice is for informal/contracted services (no PO), AP Clerk escalates directly to AP Supervisor to create retrospective PO or reject.  Then returns to G1.  

3. Task: “Log Invoice in Accounting System”  
   – Performer: AP Clerk  
   – Output: Logged Invoice record  

4. Task (automated): “Send ReceiptConfirmation Request”  
   – From System  Purchasing Officer  

5. Task: “Confirm Goods/Services Receipt”  
   – Performer: Purchasing Officer  
   – Output: Goods Receipt Confirmation  

6. Exclusive Gateway [G2]: “Goods Received?”  
   – If No  Step 6a  
   – If Yes  Step 7  

6a. Task: “Clarify delivery / follow up with supplier or warehouse”  
    – Performer: Purchasing Officer or AP Clerk  
    – Loop back to Step 5  

7. Task: “Match Invoice lineitems to PO”  
   – Performer: AP Clerk  

8. Exclusive Gateway [G3]: “Invoice matches PO exactly?”  
   – If Yes  Step 9  
   – If No  Step 8a  

8a. Task: “Report discrepancy to Purchasing”  
    – Performer: AP Clerk  
    – Output: Discrepancy Report  

8b. Exclusive Gateway [G4]: “Can Purchasing resolve discrepancy?”  
    – If Yes  loop back to Step 7 (re-match)  
    – If No  Step 8c  

8c. Task: “Escalate exception”  
    – Performer: AP Supervisor  
    – Subtasks:  
       • Contact supplier (via Supplier Relationship Manager if needed)  
       • Work with dept-heads to create retrospective PO or decide rejection  
    – Then loop back to Step 7  

9. Task (automated): “Trigger Manager Approval Request”  
   – System sends email/notification to Dept Manager  

10. Task: “Review & Approve Invoice”  
    – Performer: Department Manager  
    – System shows PO, invoice, receipt confirmation  

11. Exclusive Gateway [G5]: “Manager approves?”  
    – If Yes  Step 12  
    – If No  Step 11a  

11a. Task: “Hold invoice & investigate”  
     – Performer: AP Clerk  
     – Possible loops:  
        • Back to Step 8 (if discrepancy)  
        • Escalate to AP Supervisor (Step 8c)  
     – After resolution, loop to Step 9  

12. Task: “Schedule for Payment Run”  
    – Performer: AP Clerk  
    – Output: Payment scheduled  

13. End Event  
    – “Invoice scheduled for payment”

Notes & Ambiguities:  
• In some accounts (Dan vs. Carlos) the handoff after Manager approval feels reversed, but all agree AP Clerk ultimately schedules the payment.  
• The exact SLA for supplier follow-up or escalation isn’t specified.  
• Rare “informal service” invoices bypass PO and require retrospective PO—handled by Rita.  
• Email notifications and system tasks are assumed automated where interviewees referenced “system sends an email.”  

This textual model contains:  
• All key Activities/Tasks  
• Exclusive Gateways (G1–G5) showing diverging/looping logic  
• Roles/Lanes responsible for each step  
• Artifacts flowing (Invoice, PO, Receipt, etc.)  
• Exception and rework loops (missing PO, non-match, delivery issues, manager rejection)  

You can now convert each numbered step into BPMN shapes (Tasks, Gateways) and draw the sequence flows accordingly.
