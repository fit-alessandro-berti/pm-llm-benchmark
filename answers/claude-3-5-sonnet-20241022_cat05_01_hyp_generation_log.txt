I'll analyze the event logs for anomalies and propose investigations. Here are the key findings:

### 1. Activity Sequence Violations

**Anomaly**: Several orders show activities occurring out of expected sequence:
- Case 1002: "Confirm Shipment" and "Ship Goods" occur before "Credit Check" and "Validate Stock"
- Case 1003: "Ship Goods" occurs before "Validate Stock" (which is missing entirely)
- Case 1004: "Receive Payment" occurs before "Issue Invoice"

**Investigation Query**:
```sql
WITH expected_sequence AS (
  SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
         LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT case_id, prev_activity, activity, timestamp
FROM expected_sequence
WHERE (prev_activity = 'Ship Goods' AND activity = 'Validate Stock')
   OR (prev_activity = 'Receive Payment' AND activity = 'Issue Invoice')
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### 2. Missing Mandatory Steps

**Anomaly**: Some orders are missing crucial steps:
- Case 1003: Missing "Validate Stock"
- Case 1004: Missing "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock"

**Investigation Query**:
```sql
WITH required_steps AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_credit_check,
         MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_stock_validation
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT r.*, o.order_type, o.order_value
FROM required_steps r
JOIN orders o ON r.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE has_credit_check = 0 OR has_stock_validation = 0;
```

### 3. Unusual Time Patterns

**Anomaly**: Some activities happen suspiciously quickly after previous steps:
- Case 1002: Only 5 minutes between "Register Order" and "Confirm Shipment"
- Case 1004: Only 5 minutes between "Register Order" and "Receive Payment"

**Investigation Query**:
```sql
WITH time_differences AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         activity,
         timestamp,
         LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_timestamp,
         LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT case_id, 
       prev_activity,
       activity,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - prev_timestamp))/60 as minutes_between_activities
FROM time_differences
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - prev_timestamp))/60 < 10
  AND prev_timestamp IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY minutes_between_activities;
```

### 4. Resource Role Violations

**Anomaly**: Some activities might be performed by unauthorized roles:
- Need to verify if warehouse clerks should be handling shipments
- Need to verify if different finance team members should handle related financial transactions

**Investigation Query**:
```sql
SELECT oel.case_id,
       oel.activity,
       oel.resource,
       r.role,
       r.department
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE (oel.activity LIKE '%Payment%' AND r.department != 'Finance')
   OR (oel.activity LIKE '%Ship%' AND r.department != 'Logistics')
ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.timestamp;
```

### 5. Processing Time Analysis

**Anomaly**: Some orders are processed much faster than others, which might indicate corners being cut:

**Investigation Query**:
```sql
WITH order_times AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         MIN(timestamp) as start_time,
         MAX(timestamp) as end_time,
         COUNT(DISTINCT activity) as activity_count
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT case_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time))/3600 as processing_hours,
       activity_count,
       o.order_type,
       o.order_value
FROM order_times
JOIN orders o USING (case_id)
ORDER BY processing_hours;
```

### Potential Root Causes:

1. System Issues:
   - Lack of proper validation checks in the order processing system
   - Missing mandatory step enforcement
   - Timestamp recording issues

2. Process Issues:
   - Unclear standard operating procedures
   - Insufficient training on proper sequence
   - Pressure to expedite high-value orders
   - Lack of automated controls

3. Human Factors:
   - Staff trying to meet performance metrics by cutting corners
   - Inadequate understanding of compliance requirements
   - Insufficient supervision of critical steps

These findings suggest the need for:
- Implementation of system controls to enforce proper sequence
- Review of role-based access controls
- Additional staff training
- Process automation where possible
- Regular compliance audits
