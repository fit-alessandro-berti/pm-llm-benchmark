1. Normative rule compliance (hard-constraints)

Case 1 – COMPLIANT  
• The activities appear in the exact, required order.  
• Because the decision is “Approved”, “Finalize Documentation” is present before “Close Case”.  
• No prohibited action (e.g., finalizing after a rejection) occurs.  

Case 2 – VIOLATION  
a. Ordering error – “Risk Assessment” is executed before “Credit Check”.  
b. Mandatory step missing – “Inform Applicant” never occurs after the loan decision.  
c. Prohibited action – “Finalize Documentation” is performed even though the decision is “Rejected”.  
d. Sequence therefore ends in an illegal state (“Close Case” after a rejected-but-finalized application).  

Case 3 – COMPLIANT  
• All mandatory activities occur once and in the prescribed order.  
• “Finalize Documentation” is only done because the decision is “Approved”.  
• Case is closed correctly.  

Summary of normative status  
• Violating cases: Case 2  
• Compliant cases: Case 1, Case 3  

2. Desiderata (soft, recommended conditions)

Case 1 – Minor issues only  
• Credit Check within 24 h of application: Yes (0.5 h).  
• Applicant informed within 48 h of decision: Yes (2 h).  
• Follow-up Call before closing: Not present  desideratum missed.  

Case 2 – (In addition to hard violations)  
• Timing not assessed because the case is already non-compliant.  
• Follow-up Call not present  desideratum missed.  

Case 3 – Several soft deviations  
• Credit Check 49 h after application (24 h target exceeded).  
• Applicant informed 51 h after decision (48 h target exceeded).  
• Follow-up Call missing.  

Summary of desiderata status  
• All three cases miss at least one recommended practice (mainly the optional Follow-up Call).  
• Cases 1 & 2 have only the missing Follow-up Call; Case 3 additionally violates both timing recommendations.

3. Possible interpretations / justifications

Case 1  
• Process ran smoothly; the team may have considered a Follow-up Call unnecessary because they had immediate confirmation from the customer when the applicant was informed.

Case 2  
• The early “Risk Assessment” might reflect an emergency attempt to speed up processing or a data-entry mistake.  
• “Finalize Documentation” after a rejection could be a clerical error—perhaps a template was opened automatically and inadvertently logged.  
• Skipping “Inform Applicant” might mean the rejection notice was embedded in a batch message system that did not register as a separate event in the log.

Case 3  
• The credit bureau could not return data quickly, causing the >24 h delay.  
• The 48 h window for informing the applicant was missed, possibly due to weekend staffing or waiting for additional documentation.  
• The team may have judged a Follow-up Call unnecessary because they had already spoken with the applicant informally.

Operational takeaway  
• Focus immediate compliance effort on preventing the severe errors seen in Case 2 (ordering, missing mandatory step, and forbidden action).  
• For Cases 1 & 3, improvements should target the recommended timing goals and ensuring that a Follow-up Call (or a clear business justification for omitting it) is captured in the log.
