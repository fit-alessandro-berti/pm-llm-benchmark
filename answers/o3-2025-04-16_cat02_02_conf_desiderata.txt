  
1. Normativerule compliance (hard constraints)  
  
Case 1 – OK  
• All mandatory activities are present and appear in the correct order.  
• Branch “approved” is handled correctly (documentation finalized before closing).  
 No normative violation.

Case 2 – NOT OK  
a. Wrong order: “Risk Assessment” is logged before “Credit Check”.  
   – Breaks rule: Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.  
b. Missing activity: “Inform Applicant” never occurs although it is mandatory after the decision.  
c. Forbidden activity: “Finalize Documentation” is performed although the decision is “Rejected”.  
   – Rule: After rejection the case has to be closed without finalizing documentation.  
Result: Several hardrule violations; the trace is noncompliant.

Case 3 – OK  
• All mandatory activities are present and ordered correctly.  
• “Approved” branch followed (documentation finalized before closing).  
 No normative violation.

  
2. Desiderata compliance (soft, “nicetohave”)  
  
Timing guideline 1 – Credit Check  24 h after application  
Timing guideline 2 – Inform Applicant  48 h after decision  
Optional activity – Perform a Followup Call at some point before closing

Case 1  
• Credit Check in 0.5 h   OK  
• Inform in 2 h           OK  
• No Followup Call       Minor deviation (acceptable)  
 Minor suboptimality (missing followup), otherwise fine.

Case 2  
• Credit Check in 1 h     OK  
• No Inform Applicant     Already a hard violation; also fails the “prompt informing” desideratum.  
• No Followup Call       Minor deviation (secondary given the hard errors).

Case 3  
• Credit Check  49 h after application  Exceeds 24 h guideline.  
• Inform Applicant  51 h after decision  Exceeds 48 h guideline.  
• No Followup Call                        Minor deviation.  
 Only softrule breaches; the case is still normatively compliant but suboptimal.

  
3. Possible interpretations / justifications  
  
Case 1 – Smooth “happypath” execution; nothing to explain.

Case 2 –  
• The outoforder “Risk Assessment” could stem from a dataentry mistake or an employee trying to speedread the file before the formal credit score arrived.  
• Triggering “Finalize Documentation” for a rejected request might be a misclick or the system defaulting to the wrong template.  
• Omitting “Inform Applicant” suggests either an unlogged email/phone contact or an oversight that should be corrected because it breaches both legal and customerservice obligations.

Case 3 –  
• The application is received on a Friday (12 Jan) while the Credit Bureau responds only on Sunday the 14th; weekend or thirdparty delays could explain the >24 h gap.  
• The >48 h delay in informing the applicant may be due to waiting for a manager’s final signoff or high workload at the start of the week.  
• No followup call might be acceptable if the applicant indicated no further questions via email; still, logging such calls would document good customer care.

Summary  
• Normative violations occur only in Case 2.  
• Desiderata (timeliness / followup) are missed in Cases 1, 2, 3 to varying degrees but do not make the traces noncompliant.
