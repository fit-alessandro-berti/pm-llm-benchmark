To address the scenario described involving a complex global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics, we will create a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile based on typical industry practices and logical sequencing of activities. The goal is to estimate average times and standard deviations between pairs of activities that might follow each other in the process timeline, without relying on specific numerical data which should be estimated.

Here's how you might structure such a dictionary:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Supplier Selection (SS)', 'Order Placement (OP)'): (86400, 3600),
    ('Order Placement (OP)', 'Receive Components (RC)'): (43200, 1800),  # Adjusted for complexity between OP and RC
    ('Receive Components (RC)', 'Quality Inspection (QI)'): (10800, 1800),
    ('Quality Inspection (QI)', 'Component Assembly (CA)'): (5400, 900),
    ('Component Assembly (CA)', 'Product Testing (PT)'): (7200, 1200),  # More complex due to integration steps
    ('Product Testing (PT)', 'Packaging (PK)'): (3600, 600),
    ('Packaging (PK)', 'Warehouse Storage (WS)'): (43200, 1800),
    ('Warehouse Storage (WS)', 'Distribution (DT)'): (86400, 3600),
    ('Distribution (DT)', 'After-Sales Support (AS)'): (172800, 7200),  # Considering delivery times and support setup
    # Adding more pairs that might eventually follow each other in a long execution sequence:
    ('Supplier Selection (SS)', 'Quality Inspection (QI)'): (21600, 3600),
    ('Order Placement (OP)', 'Component Assembly (CA)'): (172800, 7200),  # Less frequent but possible with complex setups
    # ... additional pairs can be added based on potential sequences in the process chain
    
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Temporal Distances**: The values given are estimates based on typical industry practices. These times should be adjusted according to actual data from specific processes if available.
  - For shorter intervals like between inspection and assembly, smaller delays (e.g., 10800 seconds) might occur due to streamlined operations.
  - Longer gaps, such as after-distribution support or less frequent product testing steps, have higher standard deviations reflecting variability in these stages.
  
- **Complexity Considerations**: The complexity of the supply chain adds layers where activities might be out-of-sequence or delayed. For instance:
  - Moving from quality inspection to component assembly could be straightforward but involves integration checks that add some delay.
  - Distribution after warehouse storage has a broader range of variability due to external delivery dependencies.

- **Diverse Sequences**: The dictionary accounts for potential sequences where activities might not directly follow one another immediately, reflecting the non-linear nature of supply chain processes. For example:
  - Supplier selection could eventually lead to distribution indirectly through long-term supplier relationships affecting logistics and support strategies.
  
By creating such a temporal profile dictionary based on educated estimates, we can model the variability and average times within this complex global supply chain process effectively. This abstraction allows for analysis in scenarios where precise numerical data is not available or practical.
