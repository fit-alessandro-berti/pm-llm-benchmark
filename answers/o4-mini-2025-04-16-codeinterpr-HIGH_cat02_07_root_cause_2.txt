Here’s what the data tells us:

1. Which cases run unusually long?  
   • Case 2001 (Low, Region A): 1 h 30 m  
   • Case 2004 (Low, Region B): 1 h 25 m  
    “Low” complexity always closes in about 1½ hours.  
   • Case 2002 (Medium, Region B): 25 h 55 m  
   • Case 2003 (High, Region A): 48 h 20 m  
   • Case 2005 (High, Region B): 77 h 05 m  
    Medium and especially High complexity cases take days instead of hours.

2. Attribute correlation with lead-time  
   – Complexity:  
     • Low complexity  no documentrounds  1½ h.  
     • Medium  1 request for additional docs  26 h.  
     • High  multiple docrounds  48–77 h, proportional to number of rounds (2 in 2003, 3 in 2005).  
   – Region:  
     • Region A high-complexity (Case 2003) took ~48 h with 2 Doc-Request cycles.  
     • Region B high-complexity (Case 2005) took ~77 h with 3 cycles.  
     • Region B medium (Case 2002) still saw an overnight delay after the single doc-request (14:00next 10:00).  
   – Resource:  
     • Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) handles both Medium (2002) and High (2005) and generates all doc-requests for those, leading to longer queuing.  
     • Adjuster_Mike (Region A) handles the High (2003) and likewise issues doc-requests, but fewer rounds than Lisa.  
     • Manager_Bill approves all High cases (2003 & 2005) and does so only next businessmorning/late afternoon, adding to the gap.

3. Rootcause hypotheses & mitigation  
   A. Complexity  multiple backandforth with claimants  
     – Why: Highcomplexity claims need detailed evidence; adjusters issue piecemeal requests rather than a single comprehensive list.  
     – Mitigation:  
       • Prevalidate submissions at intake with a standardized high-complexity checklist.  
       • Train adjusters to bundle all information requirements into one “All-Docs Needed” request.  
       • Provide claimants an online “prefill” form guiding them through every document type.  
   B. Region B / Adjuster_Lisa overload  
     – Why: Lisa is handling both medium and high complexity in Region B, generating multiple rounds and queuing up approvals. Region B may also follow stricter local rules.  
     – Mitigation:  
       • Rebalance caseloads—assign a second high-complexity adjuster in Region B.  
       • Crosstrain a floating “Complexity Specialist” who can step in when doc requests pile up.  
       • Review Region B policy to see if some doc standards can be harmonized with Region A.  
   C. Approval batching / offhours gaps  
     – Why: Manager_Bill’s approvals occur only during “office hours” (e.g. nextmorning), so once the last doc arrives late in the day, the case sits until the next day.  
     – Mitigation:  
       • Implement a 24-hour SLA for managers on completionready cases, perhaps via mobile notifications or a small on-call team.  
       • Automate an “approval ready” queue that flags cases eligible for express handling.

By tackling these three dimensions—streamlining document handling for complex claims, rebalancing adjuster workloads (especially in Region B), and reducing approvalqueue wait times—you can bring Medium and High complexity cases down from days to under 24 hours.
