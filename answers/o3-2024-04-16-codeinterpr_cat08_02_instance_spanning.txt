====================================================================
1. IDENTIFYING INSTANCE-SPANNING CONSTRAINTS AND THEIR IMPACT
====================================================================

Step 1 – Enrich and structure the log  
• Convert the start/complete records into “sojourn time” (activity duration) and “idle time” (time-in-between activities) per order.  
• Add two derived objects that are *shared* by many cases:  
  – Resource-token (e.g., Cold-Packing-Station C1 … C5) with its busy/idle periods.  
  – Shipping-batch (Batch-ID, region, start time, close time, size).  

Step 2 – Discover the constraints formally  
(Using multi-instance DECLARE, MP-Declare or rule mining tools such as Celonis Multi-Variant Analysis, ProM ESC plug-ins, RuM, etc.)

1. Shared Cold-Packing stations  
   Rule: “No more than 5 orders can be in activity ‘Packing’ where Requires Cold Packing = TRUE at any moment.”  
   Metric set:  
   • Avg./95-percentile queue time *before* cold packing.  
   • Station utilisation, queue length distribution, % time all five stations are concurrently busy (= saturation).  
   • ‘Overtake’ events: how often an order that arrived later started earlier because it was Express.

2. Shipping batch formation  
   Rule: “An order may start ‘Shipping Label Generation’ only after the batch for its region is closed (Trigger: max-batch-size or max-wait-time).”  
   Metric set:  
   • Waiting time in “Completed-QC  Shipping label start”.  
   • Batch closure reasons (size reached vs. timeout).  
   • Batch lead-time variance and missed SLA due to late batch closure.

3. Priority / Express interruption  
   Rule: “If an Express order requests a resource, the current Standard order must finish or be paused within 2 min.”  
   Metric set:  
   • Number and duration of pre-emptions.  
   • Extra waiting time inflicted on Standard orders.  
   • Cycle-time gain for Express vs. cycle-time loss for Standard.

4. Hazardous-material concurrency cap  
   Rule: “At any time 10 HazMat orders may be in activities ‘Packing’ OR ‘Quality Check’.”  
   Metric set:  
   • Time share when the cap = 10 (bottleneck).  
   • Lead-time increase for HazMat vs. non-HazMat.  
   • Number of deferred starts caused by cap (can be mined by detecting orders whose planned start < actual start and reason = ‘cap’).

Step 3 – Separate *within*- vs *between*-instance waiting  
• Build a discrete-event timeline of resource occupancy.  
• For each idle period of an order, tag the main blocking factor:  
  – Resource busy?  between-instance (contention).  
  – Waiting for batch?  between-instance (synchronisation).  
  – None of the above?  within-instance (e.g., picking took long).  
• Use alignments: replay every case against a “no-interaction” reference model (that assumes infinite resources & immediate batching). The delta is precisely the waiting attributable to instance-spanning constraints.

====================================================================
2. ANALYSING CONSTRAINT INTERACTIONS
====================================================================

Examples of compound effects:

A. Express + Cold-Packing  
   Express orders pre-empt Cold-Packing stations. When the station count = 5, a single Express surge can freeze *all* Standard cold orders, inflating their queue length, which in turn delays batch formation for their regions.

B. HazMat cap + Shipping batches  
   If a South-region batch contains many HazMat orders, those orders are throttled at Packing/QC, so the batch remains open, thereby holding back *non-HazMat* South orders that have already cleared QC.

C. Express + HazMat  
   Express HazMat orders always consume part of the 10-order cap, leaving even less room for Standard HazMat. The cap therefore has different effective limits per priority class.

Quantifying these interactions (e.g., correlation between “cap saturation” and “batch delay”) reveals which combined situations hurt KPIs the most and where interventions should focus.

====================================================================
3. CONSTRAINT-AWARE OPTIMISATION STRATEGIES
====================================================================

Strategy 1 – Dynamic, priority-aware allocation for Cold-Packing stations  
Addresses: Shared Cold-Packing, Express priority, HazMat cap  
How:  
a. Introduce a short *time-slicing* policy instead of full pre-emption. Standard order is paused only at natural micro-milestones (e.g., after item is thermally sealed) so set-up waste is reduced.  
b. Implement a *token bucket* for Express: max 2 Express orders may occupy Cold-Packing simultaneously when queue depth of Standard > X.  
c. Predict hourly cold-pack demand with an LSTM model on the historical log; pre-shift staffing and open pop-up “flex stations” (portable cold tables) when a demand spike is predicted.  
Expected outcome: 20-30 % queue-time reduction for Standard without hurting Express SLAs; utilisation of specialised stations flattened over the day.

Strategy 2 – Adaptive shipping-batch closure rules  
Addresses: Shipping batching; mitigates HazMat interaction  
How:  
a. Mine historical travel-cost savings vs. batch wait-time curves per region.  
b. Replace fixed “batch size = 20 or 30 min timeout” by *marginal gain* logic: close the batch when the incremental saving from one more order < cost of extra wait (based on promised delivery date).  
c. Allow *split batches* for orders already delayed by other constraints (e.g., HazMat stuck in QC) so non-blocked orders proceed.  
Expected outcome: 10-15 % reduction in QCShipping idle time, more on congested regions; on-time-delivery uplift without major transport cost rise (<2 %).

Strategy 3 – Cap-aware, multi-class scheduling for HazMat  
Addresses: HazMat limit; interacts with Express & Cold-Packing  
How:  
a. Treat HazMat capacity (10 parallel tokens) as a shared resource in an optimisation model.  
b. Apply *earliest promised date / token* scheduling: allocate tokens first to orders with tighter SLA, then to Express, then to others.  
c. When token utilisation >80 %, proactively divert *non-hazardous* steps of those orders (e.g., insert a QC-preparation sub-activity that can be done outside the cap), shortening the subsequent capped activity.  
d. Evaluate possibility to raise the cap to 12 by installing two additional vented QC booths – cost/benefit derived from simulation (see next section).  
Expected outcome: 25 % shorter average wait for HazMat; overall flow time cut by 5 % thanks to fewer downstream blockages.

====================================================================
4. SIMULATION AND VALIDATION
====================================================================

Toolchain: export mined BPMN with resources + multi-instance constraints into a discrete-event simulator (e.g., AnyLogic, SimPy via PM4Py-Sim, or Celonis EMS Simulation).

Critical modelling details  
• Resources: 5 Cold-Packing stations (renewable); generic packing tables; QC staff; forklift drivers.  
• Pre-emption rule set parameterisable (pause points, setup loss).  
• Shipping batch object with closing policy variants (current vs. adaptive).  
• Hazardous token pool size and allocation rule.  
• Arrival process: replay the exact 3-month log or sample from fitted non-homogeneous Poisson model to preserve burstiness.  
• Performance KPIs: end-to-end lead-time distribution, due-time adherence, resource utilisation, #cap violations, transport cost.  
• Validation: first, reproduce historical KPI baseline with “as-is” parameters (5 % error). Then, run 1000 replications per what-if scenario and compare.

====================================================================
5. POST-IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING
====================================================================

Dashboards (near real-time, driven by continuous event streaming):

1. Cold-Packing Control Board  
   • Queue length & predicted wait (minutes) by priority.  
   • % time all stations busy.  
   • Express pre-emption counter, pause duration distribution.

2. Batch Health Monitor  
   • Open batches per region with age and current size.  
   • Orders waiting > threshold.  
   • Transport cost vs. theoretical minimum.

3. HazMat Capacity Tracker  
   • Live token usage (0-10).  
   • Orders deferred due to cap, SLA risk flag.  
   • Cap violation alerts (should be zero).

4. Global KPIs  
   • End-to-end lead-time percentile chart (overall, Express, Standard, HazMat).  
   • On-time-delivery ratio (daily, weekly).  
   • Throughput vs. forecast.

Automatic anomaly detection rules (e.g., Celonis Action Engine or ProM Stream Conformance) will raise tickets when:  
• Predicted wait for Cold-Packing > SLA buffer.  
• Batch older than recommended timeout still open.  
• HazMat token utilisation >90 % for >30 min.

The combination of these dashboards and alerts ensures the redesigned process keeps the instance-spanning constraints under control while sustaining performance gains.
