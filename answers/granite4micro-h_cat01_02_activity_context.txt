To tackle this task effectively, we must first examine each activity within the given event log to discern its role based on context, time stamps, resources involved, and subsequent actions. By doing so, we can rename the activities to reflect their unique purposes in different contexts.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Activity Identification & Renaming

1. **Initiate Request:**
   - **C001 (Case ID C001):** Initiated via online portal.
     - This activity represents a digital engagement where customers submit requests through an automated channel, marking the initial entry point for processing.
   - **C002 (Case ID C002):** Also initiated via online portal.
     - Indicates the same nature of interaction, consistent with digital submission. 
   - **C003 (Case ID C003):** Walk-in at branch reception.
     - This activity is distinct as it represents a face-to-face interaction at a physical location.

2. **Verify Documents:**
   - **C001:** Conducted by BackOfficeAgent after initial documents were uploaded, and again re-conducted post additional submission of ID scans.
     - The primary function is to verify the authenticity of submitted documents but occurs in different phases influenced by context (initial upload vs. subsequent verification).
   - **C002:** Performed by BackOfficeAgent initially, then revisited post-account adjustments due to discrepancies.
     - Similar to C001, yet here it's associated with addressing issues detected after initial checks—indicating an adaptive nature based on case progress and outcomes.
   - **C003:** Conducted by BranchOfficer both before and after account adjustments.
     - The context remains physical verification; however, the timing shifts between pre- and post-adjustment phases.

3. **Call Customer:**
   - **C001 & C002:** Both cases involve FrontlineAgent making outbound calls to verify information or follow up on discrepancies.
     - Commonly serves as a communication bridge when issues arise—clarifying details, confirming adjustments in other cases.
   - **C003:** Conducted by BranchOfficer after the customer steps out due to their walk-in nature.
     - Reflects an additional outreach attempt to encourage return and finalize processes.

4. **Adjust Account:**
   - **C002 & C003:** Both instances performed by BackOfficeAgent, with adjustments made post-call in case C002 and pre-adjustment followed by re-verification in C003.
     - The activity of adjusting accounts inherently ties into the broader context of resolving discrepancies or updating records—highlighting adaptability based on interaction nuances.

5. **Approve Request:**
   - Consistently authorized by Supervisor across all cases, indicating a final oversight step within each support workflow cycle.
   - This is uniform and context-independent given its universal applicability post-processing phases in every case.

### Justification of Naming Choices:

1. **Initiate Request:** 
   - Renamed to reflect the initial interaction mechanism (online or physical). This distinction is critical as it marks where the journey begins and differs significantly across cases.

2. **Verify Documents:**
   - Each instance retains this name but adds context-specific qualifiers (initial, post-adjustment) based on their occurrence relative to other activities within a case. The renaming clarifies that while the core function remains verification, its timing and triggers vary.

3. **Call Customer:** 
   - Distinguished by agent type in each case, emphasizing whether it’s an outbound call or follow-up after customer steps out. This captures the dynamic nature of communication driven by case outcomes rather than a static activity name.

4. **Adjust Account:**
   - Maintained as-is due to its context-dependent nature tied directly to resolution actions following calls or document verifications. The renaming reinforces that it’s an adaptive, corrective measure within each case's unique circumstances.

5. **Approve Request:** 
   - Retains the universal labeling since this activity consistently represents a final oversight, unaffected by contextual variations inherent in other activities. Its stability across cases highlights its role as a terminal validation step.

By systematically analyzing and renaming these activities based on their distinct contexts—initial engagement, verification phases post-submission or adjustment, communication channels utilized, corrective actions taken, and final approval—we've ensured clarity and precision in the event log. This structured approach facilitates easier tracking of workflows, enhances understanding for stakeholders, and aids in diagnosing issues efficiently within complex support processes.
