Based on the provided normative process description and the event log, let's analyze each case to identify any deviations from the intended process flow.

### Case 1:
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

**Evaluation**: This sequence follows the normative process as described. It includes all necessary steps in the correct order, and there are no violations.

### Case 2:
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violations Identified**:
1. **Authorizing Payment Before Packaging Items**: According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should occur after packaging items because items must be prepared before they can be shipped.
2. **Shipping After Authorization**: This is correct as per the normative process.

### Case 3:
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

**Violations Identified**:
1. **Shipping After Cancellation**: The sequence includes "Ship order" after "Cancel order," which is not allowed as per the normative process.
2. **Package Items Before Cancellation**: This step should have occurred before cancellation if it was necessary, but since it’s missing and an order was canceled, this indicates an issue with the process flow.

### Case 4:
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

**Violations Identified**:
1. **Cancellations Before Packaging Items**: According to the normative process, if there is insufficient inventory, the "Cancel order" step should occur directly after checking inventory and before any steps related to preparation or shipping.
2. **Close Order Before Package Items**: Since no packaging occurred, this close order step is premature.

### Case 5:
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Evaluation**: This sequence follows the normative process as described for normal fulfillment scenarios. There are no violations.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2** violates steps by authorizing payment before packaging items.
2. **Case 3** and **Case 4** both violate the normative process in a similar manner:
   - **Cancel order followed by ship order**: Both cases include a ship order after canceling an order, which is not allowed.
   - **Close order premature**: In Case 4, there’s no preparation (packaging) before closing the order.

These violations indicate that the processes in Cases 2, 3, and 4 do not adhere to the normative process flow as described. The correct sequence should ensure that payment authorization comes after packaging items and that cancellations precede any steps related to fulfillment (like shipping or package preparation).
