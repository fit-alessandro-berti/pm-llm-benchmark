# Procure-to-Pay Event Log Analysis

## Standard (Expected) P2P Sequence

For reference, the normative flow is:

> **Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Receive Invoice  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case**

Case **1001** follows this sequence exactly and serves as the **benchmark** for comparison.

## Anomalies Identified

### Case 1002 — Multiple Severe Control Violations

| Order | Activity | Problem |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Create Purchase Requisition | — |
| 2 | **Issue Purchase Order** |  Issued **before** requisition approval |
| 3 | Vendor Invoice Received |  Received before goods and before approval |
| 4 | **Release Payment** |  Released **before** approval, goods receipt, and invoice matching |
| 5 | Approve Purchase Requisition |  Retroactive approval — after PO and payment |
| 6 | Receive Goods |  Goods received **after** payment already made |
| 7 | Match Invoice to PO |  Matching performed **after** payment — entirely pointless as a control |
| 8 | Close Case | — |

**Why this is problematic:**
- **Skipped approval before PO issuance:** Issuing a purchase order without managerial approval bypasses the authorization control designed to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent spending.
- **Payment before goods receipt and 3-way match:** This is the most critical violation. The entire purpose of the match (PO  Goods Receipt  Invoice) is to confirm that what was ordered was actually received and correctly billed *before* money leaves the organization. Paying first eliminates leverage over the vendor and exposes the company to paying for goods never delivered, incorrect quantities, or inflated prices.
- **Retroactive approval:** Approving a requisition after the PO has been issued and payment released is a **rubber-stamp** — it provides no real control value and may indicate an attempt to cover an unauthorized transaction after the fact.
- This pattern is a strong **fraud indicator** or, at minimum, a serious breakdown of internal controls.

### Case 1003 — Payment Before Invoice, Goods, and Matching

| Order | Activity | Problem |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Create Purchase Requisition | — |
| 2 | Approve Purchase Requisition | — |
| 3 | Issue Purchase Order | — |
| 4 | **Release Payment** |  Paid **before** receiving invoice, goods, or performing any match |
| 5 | Vendor Invoice Received |  Invoice arrives after payment |
| 6 | Receive Goods |  Goods arrive after payment |
| 7 | Match Invoice to PO |  Retroactive match — no preventive control value |
| 8 | Close Case | — |

**Why this is problematic:**
- **Premature payment:** Payment is released immediately after the PO, with no evidence that the vendor has shipped anything or submitted a bill. The organization has no way to verify it is paying the correct amount for goods actually delivered.
- **Risk of overpayment or non-delivery:** Without goods receipt confirmation, the company could pay for items never received. Without an invoice, there's no agreed-upon amount — opening the door to disputes or loss.
- **Retroactive matching is meaningless:** If a discrepancy is found during the post-payment match (e.g., wrong quantity or price), recovering funds from the vendor is far more difficult than withholding payment would have been.
- This could indicate a **prepayment arrangement**, but even those typically require specific documentation and controls — none of which are evident here.

### Case 1004 — Goods Received Before Purchase Order Issued

| Order | Activity | Problem |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Create Purchase Requisition | — |
| 2 | Approve Purchase Requisition | — |
| 3 | **Receive Goods** |  Received **before** a PO was issued |
| 4 | **Issue Purchase Order** |  Retrospective / after-the-fact PO |
| 5 | Vendor Invoice Received | — |
| 6 | Match Invoice to PO | — |
| 7 | Release Payment | — |
| 8 | Close Case | — |

**Why this is problematic:**
- **Maverick purchasing / retroactive PO:** Receiving goods before a purchase order exists means a commitment was made to a vendor outside the formal procurement process. The PO was then created after the fact to "paper over" the transaction.
- **Loss of negotiation leverage and price control:** The PO is meant to establish agreed-upon terms (price, quantity, delivery) *before* the vendor ships. Accepting goods first eliminates the ability to enforce those terms.
- **Audit and compliance risk:** Retroactive POs are a red flag in audits because they circumvent spending controls and may disguise unauthorized purchases or conflicts of interest.
- **3-way match is compromised:** Although the downstream activities (invoice  match  payment) appear in order, the match is weakened because the PO was reverse-engineered to fit an already-completed receipt.

## Summary

| Case | Key Anomaly | Severity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **1001** | None — follows standard P2P flow |  Normal |
| **1002** | PO before approval; payment before goods, invoice, and match; retroactive approval |  Critical |
| **1003** | Payment before invoice, goods receipt, and matching |  Critical |
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issued (maverick buying) |  High |

Cases 1002 and 1003 represent the most serious risks — both involve **releasing payment without proper verification**, which is the single most important control in the P2P process. Case 1004, while less severe, still represents a significant procurement control failure that could enable unauthorized spending.
