Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the requirements thoroughly.

Starting with Part 1, the normative process rules. The strict sequence is: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case. The key constraints are the order of these steps, especially that Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment, and after Loan Decision, Inform Applicant has to happen. Also, if approved, finalize docs before closing; if rejected, don't finalize and close directly.

So for each case in the event log, I need to check if they follow this sequence strictly.

Looking at Case 1:
- The steps are in order: Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform, Finalize Docs, Close. That seems to follow the rules perfectly. No violations here.

Case 2:
- Application Received, then Risk Assessment without a Credit Check first. That's a violation of the ordering rule (Credit Check before Risk Assessment). Then they do Credit Check later, but that's out of order. Then Loan Decision (Rejected), then they Finalize Documentation which is not allowed after rejection. So two violations here: incorrect order and finalizing after rejection.

Case 3:
- Application, then Credit Check two days later. The desideratum says within 24 hours, but that's not a normative rule. So no normative violation there. Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant two days later (desideratum violation again, but not normative), then Finalize and Close. The sequence here seems okay: all steps in order, approved leads to finalize before close. So no normative violations here, just desiderata.

Now Part 2, desiderata. These are timing and the follow-up call. Case 2 might not have desideratum issues since the violations are normative. Case 3 has Credit Check delayed beyond 24 hours and Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48 hours. Also, no Follow-up Call.

So for task 1, normative violations: Case 2. Task 2, desiderata: Case 3 (and maybe check others). Task 3, justifications.

Wait, let me double-check Case 3's sequence. Application, then Credit Check on 14th (two days later), then Risk Assessment, Decision, Inform on 16th (two days after decision), then finalize and close. The order is correct. No skipped steps or wrong order. So only desiderata issues.

Case 2's steps: Application, Risk Assessment (without Credit Check), then Credit Check, Loan Decision, Finalize (after rejection), Close. So two normative issues: wrong order (RA before CC) and finalize after rejection.

For desiderata, Case 3's delays and missing follow-up. Also, maybe Case 1 is perfect, so no desiderata issues. Case 2's steps might have timing issues but since the main violations are normative, the desiderata might not be highlighted unless specified.

So summarizing:

1. Normative violations: Case 2.
2. Desiderata failures: Case 3 (delayed CC, delayed Inform, no Follow-up).
3. Justifications: For Case 2, maybe procedural error or mistake in ordering. For Case 3, delays could be due to workload or operational issues, follow-up call might have been done outside the log.

### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**

- **Case 2**  
  **Reasons for Violation**:  
  1. **Incorrect Activity Order**: "Risk Assessment" occurred before "Credit Check," violating the rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.  
  2. **Invalid Action After Rejection**: "Finalize Documentation" was performed after a "Loan Decision (Rejected)," which is strictly prohibited.  

  *Justification*: Human error or procedural oversight likely caused the misordering. The late Credit Check and erroneous documentation step may indicate rushed or poorly coordinated processes.

### **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata**

- **Case 3**  
  **Desiderata Violations**:  
  1. **Timing**:  
     - Credit Check occurred **48 hours** after application receipt (exceeds the recommended 24-hour window).  
     - Inform Applicant was delayed to **48 hours** after the Loan Decision (exceeds the suggested prompt notification).  
  2. **Missing Recommended Action**: No "Follow-up Call" was recorded before closing the case.  

  *Clarification*: These deviations reflect suboptimal timing and procedural gaps but do not violate strict rules.

### **3. Interpretations for Observed Behaviors**

#### **Case 2 (Normative Violations)**  
- **Misordered Activities**: The team may have mistakenly assumed Risk Assessment could precede Credit Check due to urgency or unfamiliarity with protocols.  
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection**: This could result from a template error (e.g., automatic triggers) or ignorance of rejection procedures.  

#### **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations)**  
- **Delays**: Operational bottlenecks (e.g., staff workload, system glitches) might have caused the Credit Check and notification delays.  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**: The call may have occurred informally (e.g., phone call not logged) or been deemed unnecessary for a straightforward approval.  

#### **Case 1 (Compliant)**  
- **Best Practice Alignment**: All steps and timelines adhered to both normative rules and desiderata, indicating efficient process execution.
