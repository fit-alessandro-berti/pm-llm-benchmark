This analysis examines the event log against standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) best practices, focusing on key control points: authorization (requisition approval, PO issuance), verification (goods receipt), and payment controls (invoice matching).

Case 1001 follows a standard, compliant P2P sequence (Requisition -> Approval -> PO -> Receipt -> Invoice -> Matching -> Payment). The remaining cases exhibit significant anomalies.

## Identified Anomalies and Process Control Violations

The most critical control points in P2P are the **authorization of the commitment** (PR/PO approval) and the **verification of the fulfillment** (Goods Receipt and 3-way match) before **payment release**.

### Case 1002 Anomalies: Complete Process Disregard

Case 1002 exhibits a severe breakdown in almost every standard control mechanism.

| Anomaly | Sequence Violation | Explanation of Problem |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A1: PO Issued Before Approval** | `Issue Purchase Order` (08:40) before `Approve Purchase Requisition` (08:00 on 02/03) | Issuing a Purchase Order commits the organization financially. Doing so before the Purchase Requisition is approved violates budgetary controls and segregation of duties. The commitment was made without the required sign-off. |
| **A2: Payment Before Verification** | `Release Payment` (07:15) occurs before `Approve Purchase Requisition`, `Receive Goods`, and `Match Invoice to PO`. | Payment was executed based only on a received invoice and an unauthorized PO. This is a massive internal control failure (bypassing the 3-way match). It risks paying for goods not yet delivered, goods that were never ordered, or goods that were defective. |
| **A3: Retroactive Approval/Verification** | `Approve Purchase Requisition`, `Receive Goods`, and `Match Invoice to PO` all occur *after* payment has been released. | The approval, receipt, and matching activities become meaningless administrative steps used to close the case, rather than true control steps used to validate the transaction. This suggests the payment was expedited improperly. |

### Case 1003 Anomalies: Prepayment Risk

Case 1003 shows issues related to premature payment, often indicating either highly unusual commercial terms or a system error where payment was triggered incorrectly.

| Anomaly | Sequence Violation | Explanation of Problem |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A4: Payment Before Documentation** | `Release Payment` occurs before `Vendor Invoice Received` and `Receive Goods`. | This constitutes an unverified prepayment. Without receiving the invoice, the organization doesn't know the exact amount due, and without receiving the goods, they have no proof of delivery. This puts the organization at risk of fraud or non-delivery, as payment leverage is lost before fulfillment. |

### Case 1004 Anomalies: Maverick Buying and Retroactive PO

Case 1004 demonstrates procurement actions (receiving goods) that occurred before the proper contractual documentation (Purchase Order) was in place.

| Anomaly | Sequence Violation | Explanation of Problem |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A5: Goods Received Without PO** | `Receive Goods` (09:00) occurs before `Issue Purchase Order` (09:15). | Standard P2P requires a formal Purchase Order (PO) to be issued and accepted by the vendor before any goods are shipped or services are rendered. Receiving goods without a PO indicates **"Maverick Buying"**—an off-system purchase initiated verbally or informally. This makes it impossible to verify the goods against a pre-approved contract, potentially leading to incorrect pricing or unauthorized purchases. |
| **A6: Retroactive PO Issuance** | The Purchase Order is issued *after* the goods have already been physically accepted. | This is often called a "confirming PO." The PO is created solely to satisfy administrative requirements and enable payment processing, but it defeats the primary purpose of the PO, which is to establish legal and financial control *before* the transaction takes place. |

## Summary of Findings and Implications

The anomalies highlight systemic failures in enforcing the sequential controls necessary for financial safeguarding:

| Case | Primary Control Failure | Risk/Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1002** | Lack of Authorization & Verification (Payment before everything) | High risk of financial loss, fraud, paying for non-existent items, and total failure of segregation of duties. |
| **1003** | Lack of Verification (Prepayment) | Risk of non-delivery, unnecessary working capital expenditure, and loss of leverage against the vendor. |
| **1004** | Lack of Authorization (Maverick Buying) | Procurement is performed outside of established contracts, potentially leading to suboptimal pricing, unauthorized spending, and compliance issues. |
