The provided information describes a workflow for processing declarations, which can be seen as requests or applications that need to go through various stages of approval and review. Each declaration goes through different states managed by distinct roles: EMPLOYEE (the person making the request), PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, ADMINISTRATION, and sometimes involves handling payment.

Here is a breakdown of the process based on the given data:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: An initial submission is made by an employee which triggers the workflow.

2. **First Approval Stages**:
   - The declaration can go to PRE_APPROVER or directly to SUPERVISOR for approval, depending on the nature and type of request.
   
3. **Approval Paths**:
   - If it reaches the PRE_APPROVER first:
     - It could be APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER.
     - It may require further SAVING back at EMPLOYEE’s side before resubmission if any changes are needed or if missing information is identified and requires a revision from the employee. This step can happen several times until the declaration meets all requirements.
   - The declaration might also face REJECTIONS at multiple stages: by PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, or MISSING (indicating that some essential data or information is lacking).
   
4. **Supervisor and Budget Owner Involvement**:
   - After being APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER or after necessary changes are made, the declaration then goes to SUPERVISOR for approval.
     - If APPROVED here, it moves towards the FINAL_APPROVED stage if all required checks have been completed successfully.
   - It might also pass through BUDGET OWNER before final approval, where similar paths of rejection and request for further information can occur.

5. **Final Approvals**:
   - The declaration finally reaches its FINAL_APPROVED state by SUPERVISOR, indicating it has been reviewed and approved at all necessary levels.
   
6. **Post-Approval Actions**:
   - After final approval, the declaration can move to Payment Handling or be marked as Request for Payment, suggesting that any required financial transactions are then initiated based on the approved request.
     - The process concludes with handling payment once it's requested and processed.

Throughout this workflow, there is a strong emphasis on ensuring all information is correct and complete at each stage. If any discrepancies or missing details are detected, the declaration may cycle back through earlier stages for correction before moving forward again.

In summary, the described process ensures comprehensive review of declarations by different stakeholders to ensure their integrity and compliance with necessary criteria, ultimately leading to final approval or rejection based on predefined rules and checks at each level.
