Let's proceed step by step: analyzing the models, identifying anomalies, and finally determining which model is closer to the normative Hire-to-Retire process.

---

## 1. **Normative Hire-to-Retire Process**
The expected steps, in strict or semi-strict order:
1. **Post_Job_Ad**
2. **Screen_Candidates**
3. **Conduct_Interviews**
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision**
5. **Onboard_Employee**
6. **Add_to_Payroll**
7. **Close_Case**

Generally:
- **Screening** must precede **Interview** (or run in parallel but only candidates passing screening get interviewed).
- **Interview** must precede **Decision**.
- **Onboarding** and **Payroll** only happen after a hiring decision.
- **Close_Case** is always last.

## 2. **Analysis of each Model and Identifying Anomalies**

---

### **POWL Model 1**

**Code Representation:**
```python
model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```

**Partial Order:**
- **Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates**
- **Screen_Candidates  Make_Hiring_Decision**
- **Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews**
- **Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case**

#### **What does this mean?**
- **After screening, you can either:**  
  - **Make a decision immediately** OR  
  - **Conduct interviews** (but these are not strictly ordered: either/both can come after screening)
- **Nothing requires that interviews occur before the hiring decision is made!**  
  (You could make a decision *before or even without* conducting interviews.)

#### **Severe anomaly:**
- **Deciding before interviewing.** In practice, hiring decisions made without interviewing candidates is a major process error.

#### **Other anomalies:**
- **Parallelism:** You may conduct interviews and make a decision independently after screening. There is no enforced dependency that interviews *must* occur before a decision.
- **You might skip interviews entirely, but still make a hiring decision** (because there's no edge Decide  Interview).

---

### **POWL Model 2**

**Code Representation:**
```python
# Pseudocode:
loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard_Employee, skip)
xor_payroll = XOR(Add_to_Payroll, skip)

model2 order:
Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates
Post_Job_Ad  Conduct_Interviews
Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision
Make_Hiring_Decision  loop_onboarding
loop_onboarding  xor_payroll
xor_payroll  Close_Case
```

#### **What does this mean?**
- **After posting a job ad, both screening and interviews can start in parallel.**  
  (i.e., screening and interviews can happen simultaneously, not in sequence.)
- **Screening and interviews are not strictly ordered.**  
- **Hiring decision strictly AFTER interviews** (good).
- **Onboarding may be repeated** (due to the loop), or skipped (silent transition in loop).
- **Adding to payroll is OPTIONAL** (XOR with skip).
- **Case can close even if no onboarding or no payroll entry occurred.**

#### **Anomalies:**
- **Screening can occur independently, in parallel with interviews.** There is no constraint that screening must be done before interviews, which is not typical.
- **Onboarding can be skipped or repeated multiple times** (due to the loop and skip node).
- **Payroll can be skipped entirely.** This allows hiring/onboarding someone without adding them to the payroll.
- **It is possible (if skip is chosen in both loop and XOR) for a case to close with no onboarding and no payroll.**
- **Screening and interviews are not causally related.**  
  - You could interview candidates who haven't been screened, or even skip screening altogether for all intents and purposes.

## 3. **Summary Table of Anomalies**

| Step                        | Norm | Model 1             | Model 2              |
|-----------------------------|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Screen before Interview     | Yes  | NO (Not enforced)   | NO (Not enforced)    |
| Interview before Decision   | Yes  | NO (Not enforced)   | YES (Strict order)   |
| Can skip Interview          | No   | YES                 | NO                   |
| Can decide before Interview | No   | YES                 | NO                   |
| Can skip Onboarding         | No   | No                  | YES (skip possible)  |
| Can skip Payroll            | No   | No                  | YES (skip possible)  |
| Multiple Onboarding         | No   | No                  | YES (loop possible)  |
| Close before Onboard/Payroll| No   | No                  | YES (if skips taken) |

## 4. **Which Model is Closer to Normative Process?**

### **Model 1**:
- **Allows making a hiring decision before interviews, or skipping interviews entirely.** This is severe, as interviews are generally a required step before any hiring decision.
- **Once a (potentially premature) hiring decision is made, the rest of the process runs sequentially in typical fashion (onboard, payroll, close).**
- **No mechanism for skipping onboarding/payroll; the process must reach those steps eventually.**

### **Model 2**:
- **Forces interview before decision (GOOD), but screening and interviews can occur in parallel, which is unusual.**
- **More severe: Onboarding and Payroll can both be skipped entirely** (via skip in the loop/XOR), which is a fundamental process integrity violation.
- **Unrealistically, the process can close *without any hiring or even payroll addition ever happening*, if skips are taken.**
- **Also, onboarding can repeatedly occur unnecessarily (loop), which is odd.**
- **Screening can be bypassed for interview, meaning unfiltered candidates may be interviewed, also a real-world inconsistency.**

## 5. **Conclusion – Which Model is Less Anomalous and Why?**

### **Model 1 aligns closer to the correct Hire-to-Retire process.**

#### **Justification:**
- The most severe process anomaly of **Model 2** is that you can finish the process with neither onboarding nor payroll, which undermines the essential goal of the process (successfully hiring and integrating an employee).
- **Model 1**, for all its faults, at least guarantees that when a hiring decision is made, onboarding and payroll will *definitely* happen.
- **Model 2 introduces more severe anomalies** (skipping essential steps, potentially closing cases with nothing accomplished) than **Model 1**.  
- **Model 1’s anomaly** (possible to decide before interviewing) is serious, but at least assumes that once you decide, the correct steps will follow.

## 6. **Summary Table: Anomaly Impact**

| Anomaly                                   | Model 1 | Model 2 | Which is worse   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------------|
| Decide before interview                   | Yes     | No      | Model 1 worse    |
| Onboarding/payroll can be skipped         | No      | Yes     | Model 2 worse    |
| Multiple onboarding / loop onboarding     | No      | Yes     | Model 2 worse    |
| Case closes with nothing accomplished     | No      | Yes     | Model 2 worse    |
| Interview without screening possible      | No      | Yes     | Model 2 worse    |

---

**In summary:**
- **Model 1's chief flaw** is allowing hiring decisions before interviews.
- **Model 2's issues** allow the process to skip crucial steps or accomplish nothing at all, which contradicts the essential goal of the process.
- **Model 1 more closely preserves process integrity.**

---

## **Final Answer**

> **Model 1 more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process.**
>
> While Model 1 allows a hiring decision before interviews (which is a significant process error), it guarantees that after hiring, onboarding and payroll must occur, and the case is only closed at the end. In contrast, Model 2 permits skipping onboarding and payroll entirely, closing the process without a hire, and allows multiple or zero onboarding steps, fundamentally undermining the purpose and outcome of the process. Thus, Model 1's deviations are less severe in terms of process correctness and integrity.
