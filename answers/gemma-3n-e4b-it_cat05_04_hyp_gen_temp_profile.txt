## Anomalies, Hypotheses, and Verification Queries

### Anomalies

The following anomalies are present in the temporal profile model:

*   **R to P (Receive to Approve):** Average time of 90000 seconds (25 hours) with a low standard deviation (3600 seconds - 1 hour).
*   **P to N (Approve to Notify):** Average time of 604800 seconds (7 days) with a high standard deviation (172800 seconds - 2 days).
*   **A to C (Assign to Close):** Average time of 7200 seconds (2 hours) with a standard deviation of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
*   **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** Average time of 300 seconds (5 minutes) with a low standard deviation of 60 seconds (1 minute).



### Hypotheses

1.  **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  The abnormally long average time with low standard deviation suggests a possible backlog or a manual bottleneck in the approval process. Perhaps a large number of claims are waiting to be reviewed by a single adjuster or a limited team.  The low standard deviation indicates that the delay is consistent, not random.

2.  **P to N (Approve to Notify):** The extremely long average time with a high standard deviation points to significant delays in notification. This could be due to a lack of automated notification systems, manual data entry errors delaying notification,  inconsistent customer contact information causing delays, or resource constraints in the notification team.  The high standard deviation suggests significant variation in these delays.

3.  **A to C (Assign to Close):**  A very quick closure after assignment (2 hours) could be due to several factors.  It may indicate that simple claims are being closed without further evaluation or approval.  Alternatively, it could mean some claims are being closed prematurely without proper documentation or validation, perhaps due to automated system errors.

4.  **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** An average of 5 minutes between evaluation and notification strongly suggests automation, potentially skipping necessary checks or reviews.  The low standard deviation supports the idea that this is a consistently executed automated step.  It's also possible that manual reviews are not required after the evaluation, streamlining the process.



### Verification Queries (SQL)

1.  **Identify claims with prolonged "Receive to Approve" time:**

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.submission_date,
    e.timestamp
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE
    e.activity = 'R'
    AND e.activity = 'P'
    AND e.timestamp - e.previous_timestamp > INTERVAL '24 hours'; -- Check if greater than 24 hours.  Adjust time frame as needed
```

2.  **Investigate "Approve to Notify" delays and their variation:**

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.submission_date,
    e.timestamp,
    (e.timestamp - LAG(e.timestamp, 1, e.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY c.claim_id ORDER BY e.timestamp)) AS time_since_previous_event
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE
    e.activity = 'P'
    AND e.activity = 'N';
```

3.  **Analyze claims closed immediately after assignment:**

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.submission_date,
    e.timestamp
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE
    e.activity = 'A'
    AND e.activity = 'C'
    AND e.timestamp - e.previous_timestamp < INTERVAL '2 hours'; -- Check if closure happened within 2 hours of assignment. Adjust as needed
```

4.  **Check for overly rapid "Evaluate to Notify" transitions:**

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.submission_date,
    e.timestamp,
    (e.timestamp - LAG(e.timestamp, 1, e.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY c.claim_id ORDER BY e.timestamp)) AS time_since_previous_event
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE
    e.activity = 'E'
    AND e.activity = 'N'
    AND (e.timestamp - e.previous_timestamp) < INTERVAL '5 minutes'; -- Check for less than 5 minute difference. Adjust the value as required.
```
