**Assumptions and Notes:**
- Case ID is `order_id`.
- Activity names are derived logically: "Order Created" from the Orders table; individual "Pick [ITEM-ID]" events from Order Lines (one per line item for granularity, as each has unique timestamps and resources); "Dispatch Shipment [DELIVERY-ID]" and "Delivery Arrived [DELIVERY-ID]" from Delivery table (one pair per delivery record); "Issue Invoice [INVOICE-ID]" from Invoice table; "Receive Payment [PAYMENT-ID]" from Payments table.
- Timestamps are used directly from the source tables, ensuring chronological order within each case (sorted by timestamp per case ID).
- Resources are mapped from the Resources table where applicable (sales person for order creation, picker for picking, carrier for dispatch/arrival, billing person for invoicing). No resource is assigned to payments, as none is specified.
- Order 1004 lacks delivery, invoice, and payment records, so its process ends at picking (possibly incomplete in data).
- No additional events inferred beyond the provided data; delivery notes (e.g., "Normal route") are not included as they are not core attributes for the event log.
- For order 1002, the second delivery arrival (2024-01-08T10:00:00Z) precedes the first invoice issuance (2024-01-08T10:15:00Z) chronologically, reflecting potential partial processing.
- No other attributes (e.g., amounts, quantities) are included in separate columns to maintain a concise log focused on process flow; they can be derived from source tables if needed for mining.
