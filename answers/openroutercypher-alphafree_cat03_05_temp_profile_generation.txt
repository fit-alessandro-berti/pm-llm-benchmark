Here is a representative Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the given global supply chain process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 43200),  # SS -> OP (2 days avg with 12 hours std dev)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 120960), # OP -> RC (1 week avg with 1.5 days std dev)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (10800, 1800),    # RC -> QI (3 hours avg with 30 minutes std dev)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 2880),    # QI -> CA (4 hours avg with 48 minutes std dev)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 17280),   # CA -> PT (1 day avg with 4.8 hours std dev)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),     # PT -> PK (2 hours avg with 30 minutes std dev)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (10800, 2700),    # PK -> WS (3 hours avg with 45 minutes std dev)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 21600),   # WS -> DT (1 day avg with 6 hours std dev)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1209600, 241920), # DT -> AS (2 weeks avg with 2.8 days std dev)
    
    # Skipped steps representative pairs
    ('SS', 'QI'): (622080, 155520), # SS -> QI (1 week and 1 day avg with 1.8 days std dev)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (653160, 155520), # OP -> CA (1 week and 1.3 days avg with 1.8 days std dev)
    ('RC', 'PT'): (100800, 20160),  # RC -> PT (1 day 4 hours avg with 5.6 hours std dev)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (98160, 19632),   # QI -> PK (1 day 3.4 hours avg with 5.45 hours std dev)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (185760, 37152),  # CA -> WS (2 days 3 hours avg with 10.32 hours std dev)
    ('PT', 'DT'): (95040, 19008),   # PT -> DT (1 day 2.4 hours avg with 5.28 hours std dev)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (1296000, 324000), # PK -> AS (2 weeks 2 days avg with 3.75 days std dev)
    ('WS', 'AS'): (1209600, 264600) # WS -> AS (2 weeks avg with 3.07 days std dev)
}

# Dictionary Explanation:
# Each tuple key represents a pair of activities.
# Each value tuple contains average time in seconds and standard deviation in seconds.
```

This dictionary includes pairs of activities that may be directly connected or separated by multiple process steps. The times are expressed in seconds, considering the average delays and possible variabilities between the activities.
