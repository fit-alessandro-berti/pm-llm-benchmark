# Step 6: Final Go-Live Approval (depends on QA and SA)
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Construct the loop for configuration:

loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Add final order edge for GLA depending on QA and SA
final_phase = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[final_tasks, GLA])
final_phase.order.add_edge(final_tasks, GLA)

# Because final_tasks is itself a StrictPartialOrder, 
# as nodes contain QA and SA concurrently

# Now prepare the partial order representing DA and ACI in parallel
parallel_setup = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
# No edges between DA and ACI: they are concurrent

# After SR and CS: SR --> CS
# Then CS --> parallel_setup

# Combine SR, CS and parallel_setup in a partial order
initial_phase = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, parallel_setup])
initial_phase.order.add_edge(SR, CS)                 # CS after SR
initial_phase.order.add_edge(CS, parallel_setup)     # parallel_setup after CS

# Now, since parallel_setup contains DA and ACI, tasks in parallel

# Now build the big partial order for the main flow:
# root nodes are: initial_phase, loop_config, deployment_choice, final_phase
# partial order edges:
#   parallel_setup must be completed before loop_config
#   loop_config must be completed before deployment_choice
#   deployment_choice must be completed before final_phase

# Because partial order nodes expect POWL models (StrictPartialOrder or OperatorPOWL or Transition),
# and initial_phase and final_phase already are StrictPartialOrders

root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[initial_phase, loop_config, deployment_choice, final_phase]
)

# Define the ordering constraints between these big phases:
# initial_phase --> loop_config
# loop_config --> deployment_choice
# deployment_choice --> final_phase

root.order.add_edge(initial_phase, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, deployment_choice)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, final_phase)

# The entire model hierarchy is now:
# root
#  |- initial_phase (SR -> CS -> parallel_setup(DA and ACI concurrent))
#  |- loop_config (* ( BNC, D&R ))
#  |- deployment_choice (XOR CD or MD)
#  |- final_phase (final_tasks(QA and SA concurrent) -> GLA)

# END of model construction

# For clarity, this can be used as the final step:
powl_model = root

### Explanation of Key Steps in the Code

- **SR and CS** are sequentially ordered within `initial_phase`.
- **DA and ACI** are children of a `StrictPartialOrder` with no order edges, making them concurrent.
- **initial_phase** orders SR -> CS -> parallel_setup task.
- **loop_config** models the loop of (BNC followed by optional D&R zero or more times).
- **deployment_choice** models the XOR choice between CD and MD.
- **final_tasks** models concurrent QA and SA.
- **final_phase** orders final_tasks -> GLA.
- **The root partial order** preserves the top-level sequencing: initial_phase -> loop_config -> deployment_choice -> final_phase.

This code fully encodes the complex telecom provisioning process as a POWL model.
