**Solution:**

To solve this problem using DuckDB, we can break it down into several steps. We'll first create a derived table that captures the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id`, then count the occurrences of each variant, and finally filter to return only the events from the top K variants.

Here's how you could write the SQL queries to achieve this:

### Step 1: Construct the Ordered Sequence for Each Case

First, we create a view or a temporary table that orders activities by their `timestamp` within each `case_id`.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ordered_activities AS
SELECT case_id, activity, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence
FROM event_log;
```

### Step 2: Aggregate and Count Variants

Next, we determine the unique process variants by grouping by the sequence of activities. We then count the occurrences of each variant.

```sql
CREATE VIEW variant_counts AS
SELECT string_agg(activity, ' -> ') as activity_sequence, COUNT(*) as variant_count
FROM ordered_activities
GROUP BY case_id, activity_sequence;
```

### Step 3: Determine Top K Variants by Frequency

Now, we identify the top K variants based on their frequency. Let's assume K is a parameter you define, for example, `K = 5`.

```sql
WITH top_variants AS (
  SELECT activity_sequence, variant_count
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY variant_count DESC
  LIMIT K
)
SELECT * FROM top_variants;
```

### Step 4: Return Events from Top K Variants

Finally, we filter the original event log to return only events belonging to cases that are part of these top K variants.

```sql
WITH top_cases AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM ordered_activities
  JOIN top_variants ON string_agg(activity, ' -> ') = activity_sequence
)
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases);
```

This query sequence ensures that we:
1. Construct the ordered sequence of activities per case.
2. Count the occurrences of each unique variant.
3. Filter to get the top K variants based on frequency.
4. Retrieve all events from cases that belong to these top K variants.

**Note:** Replace `K` with the actual number of top variants you wish to consider. The solution assumes `K` is defined or passed as a parameter depending on your application setup.
