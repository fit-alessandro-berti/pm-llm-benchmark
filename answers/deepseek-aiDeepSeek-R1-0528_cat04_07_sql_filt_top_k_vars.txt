We are going to break down the problem into steps:

 Step 1: For each case_id, we want to get the ordered sequence of activities (by timestamp). We can use string_agg to form a string representing the sequence. However, note that we need to preserve the order and also we might have the same activity names in different orders. We can use an array_agg to preserve the sequence? But then we cannot group by an array. Alternatively, we can form a string by concatenating the activities in order (with a delimiter) and then group by that string.

 Step 2: We want to count the number of cases per variant (the sequence string). Then we want to get the top K variants by frequency.

 Step 3: We want to return all events from the original event log that belong to cases which are in the top K variants.

 However, note: We are asked to return the events (all columns? the original events) for the cases that are in the top K variants.

 Approach:

 1. Create a CTE (or subquery) that for each case_id, aggregates the activities in order to form a variant string (or array? but grouping by array is not supported in DuckDB? Actually, DuckDB does support grouping by arrays, but let's be cautious: we can use a string). We'll use a delimiter that is unlikely to appear in the activity names, e.g., '~' or just use no delimiter? But if we use no delimiter, then sequences like ['A','B'] and ['AB'] would be the same. So we use a delimiter.

 2. Then, we count the cases per variant and rank the variants by frequency (count of cases). We can use ROW_NUMBER or RANK? We want top K by frequency. We can use ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC and then LIMIT K? But note: what if there are ties? The problem says "top K variants by their frequency". We'll assume we break ties arbitrarily? Or we can use RANK and then include all variants that are in the top K ranks? But the problem says "top K" meaning the K most frequent. So if we have ties at the K-th place, we might get more than K. The problem does not specify. We'll assume we want exactly K, so we break ties arbitrarily? Actually, the problem says "the top K variants", meaning the K most frequent. So if there is a tie at the K-th place, we might have to include all? But the problem does not specify. However, note that the requirement says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants". So if we have more than K variants because of ties, that's acceptable? But the problem says "top K", meaning we want exactly K? Let me re-read: "determine the top K variants by their frequency". We'll use RANK and then take all variants that have a rank <= K? But then we might get more than K. Alternatively, we can use DENSE_RANK? Actually, we can use the LIMIT clause with ties? DuckDB supports WITH TIES in LIMIT? Actually, DuckDB does support `FETCH FIRST K ROWS WITH TIES` but only if we specify an ORDER BY and then use WITH TIES. However, we are going to use a window function? Alternatively, we can do:

    WITH ranked_variants AS (
        ...,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as rn
    )
    and then take rn <= K -> this gives exactly K rows (if there are at least K) but breaks ties arbitrarily.

    But if we want to include ties, we can do:

        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as dr

    and then dr <= K? But note: DENSE_RANK would assign the same rank to ties, so if the top frequency has 10 variants, then they all get rank 1, then next distinct frequency gets rank 2, etc. So if we take dr<=K, we might get more than K variants? Actually, that's what we want: we want all variants that are in the top K by frequency? But note: the problem says "top K variants", meaning the K most frequent. However, if there are ties, we might have more than K. The problem does not specify. Since the problem says "the top K variants", I think we should return exactly K variants? But then we break ties arbitrarily? 

    The problem does not specify how to break ties. We'll assume we break ties arbitrarily and take exactly K. So we use ROW_NUMBER.

    Alternatively, we can use:

        ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant  -- but variant is a string, so we can break ties by the variant string? But that would be arbitrary.

    Actually, the problem does not specify, so we can choose arbitrarily.

    However, note: the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", meaning we order by frequency (descending) and then take the first K. So we can use:

        ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC
        LIMIT K

    But this will break ties arbitrarily? Actually, DuckDB's LIMIT without WITH TIES will return exactly K rows, even if there are ties? So if the K-th row has the same frequency as the next row, we skip the next row? That might not be what we want? 

    The problem says "top K variants by their frequency", meaning we want the K most frequent. So if there are ties at the K-th place, we should include all? But then we exceed K. The problem does not specify. We'll follow the specification: we want exactly K variants? Or we want all variants that are in the top K frequencies? 

    Since the problem says "the top K variants", I think we want exactly K. So we break ties arbitrarily? But note: the problem does not specify a tie-breaker. We can break ties by the variant string? Or by the first case_id? Actually, we don't care. We'll use ROW_NUMBER and then take the top K rows.

    However, the problem says "by their frequency", so we are ordering by frequency. We can break ties arbitrarily? Let's do:

        ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC, variant   -- variant is the string, so we break ties by the variant string? But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, we can break ties by the min(case_id) or max(case_id)? Actually, we don't need to. We can just use:

        ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC

        and then LIMIT K -> which will pick arbitrarily? Actually, without an order on the second column, the order of rows with the same frequency is arbitrary. So we might get different results on different runs? But we don't care as long as we get K.

    Alternatively, we can break ties by the variant string to have deterministic results? Let's do:

        ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC, variant

    Then we get the same result every time.

 3. We'll use:

        WITH variant_counts AS (
            SELECT 
                variant,
                COUNT(case_id) as frequency
            FROM (
                SELECT 
                    case_id,
                    string_agg(activity, '~' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
                FROM event_log
                GROUP BY case_id
            ) as cases
            GROUP BY variant
            ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant
            LIMIT K   -- K is a parameter? We'll assume we can use a placeholder? Or we can use a variable? In DuckDB, we can use a parameter. But for the benchmark, we can assume K is given as a constant? Let's say K=5? Actually, the problem says "top K", so we need to make it variable? But in the query, we can use a constant? The problem doesn't specify. We'll write the query for a fixed K=5.

        )

    But note: we need to return events for the cases that are in the top K variants. So we need to get the case_ids that have a variant that is in the top K.

 4. Then, we need to get the case_ids that have a variant that is in the top K. We can do:

        WITH case_variants AS (
            SELECT 
                case_id,
                string_agg(activity, '~' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
            FROM event_log
            GROUP BY case_id
        ),
        variant_counts AS (
            SELECT 
                variant,
                COUNT(case_id) as frequency
            FROM case_variants
            GROUP BY variant
            ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant
            LIMIT 5   -- let's say top 5
        ),
        top_cases AS (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM case_variants
            WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
        )
        SELECT event_log.*
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases)

 5. However, note: we are forming the variant by string_agg. But what if the event log has duplicate timestamps for the same case? Then the order might be arbitrary? The problem says "determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp". So if there are duplicate timestamps, the order is not defined? We can break ties arbitrarily? The problem doesn't specify. We'll break ties by the activity name? Or we can use the order of insertion? But DuckDB doesn't guarantee order without a deterministic sort. So we should break ties by activity? Or by another column? The problem doesn't specify. We'll assume timestamps are unique? If not, we can break ties arbitrarily? Actually, we can break ties by adding another column? But we don't have one. So we'll do:

        ORDER BY timestamp, activity   -- to break ties? But the problem says only by timestamp. So if two events have the same timestamp, then the order is arbitrary? Then our variant string might be non-deterministic? We need to make it deterministic. We'll break ties by activity? The problem doesn't specify, but for the sake of having a deterministic query, we break ties by activity.

    Alternatively, we can break ties by the rowid? But we don't have a rowid. So we'll break ties by activity? Let's do:

        string_agg(activity, '~' ORDER BY timestamp, activity)

    But note: the problem says "by timestamp", so we are allowed to break ties arbitrarily? And the problem doesn't specify how. So we choose arbitrarily? We'll break ties by activity.

 6. Let's write the full query for K=5.

    We'll use:

        WITH case_variants AS (
            SELECT 
                case_id,
                string_agg(activity, '~' ORDER BY timestamp, activity) as variant
            FROM event_log
            GROUP BY case_id
        ),
        variant_counts AS (
            SELECT 
                variant,
                COUNT(*) as frequency
            FROM case_variants
            GROUP BY variant
            ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant   -- break ties by variant string
            LIMIT 5
        ),
        top_cases AS (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM case_variants
            WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
        )
        SELECT event_log.*
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases)

 7. However, note: we are grouping by variant and then counting the number of cases per variant. Then we take the top 5 variants. Then we get the case_ids that have one of these variants.

 8. But what if the event log is huge? We are aggregating the entire log? That might be heavy, but the problem doesn't specify size.

 9. Also note: we are using a string_agg with a delimiter. If the case has a lot of events, the string might be long? But that's acceptable.

 10. Let me test with a small example? Not here, but we can assume it works.

 11. We are returning all events from the original log for the cases that are in the top K variants. The events are returned in the original order? The problem doesn't specify an order for the result. So we can return in any order? Or we should return in the same order as the original? The original log might not be ordered. We can order by case_id, timestamp? But the problem doesn't specify. We'll leave without ordering? Or we can order by case_id, timestamp? The problem says "return the corresponding events", so we don't need to change the order? But the original log might be unordered. We'll leave unordered? Or we can order by case_id, timestamp? The problem doesn't specify. We'll leave without ordering.

 12. However, note: the problem says "return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants". So we are returning the events as they are? Yes.

 13. But note: we broke ties by activity? The problem didn't specify, but we did it for determinism.

 14. We can also use an array instead of a string? DuckDB supports arrays and grouping by arrays? Let me check: DuckDB does support grouping by arrays? Yes, because arrays are comparable. So we can do:

        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp, activity) as variant_arr

    Then group by variant_arr? Then we don't need a delimiter? And it's safer? But then the variant representation is an array? And we can use it in GROUP BY? Yes.

    Alternatively, we can use the array for grouping? Then we don't have to worry about delimiters? But then the ORDER BY in the array_agg is important.

    Let me change to array_agg:

        WITH case_variants AS (
            SELECT 
                case_id,
                array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp, activity) as variant_arr
            FROM event_log
            GROUP BY case_id
        ),
        variant_counts AS (
            SELECT 
                variant_arr,
                COUNT(*) as frequency
            FROM case_variants
            GROUP BY variant_arr
            ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant_arr   -- arrays are comparable? Yes, lexicographically.
            LIMIT 5
        ),
        top_cases AS (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM case_variants
            WHERE variant_arr IN (SELECT variant_arr FROM variant_counts)
        )
        SELECT event_log.*
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases)

 15. This might be better? Because we avoid the delimiter issue? But arrays might be more expensive? But it's acceptable.

 16. However, note: the problem does not specify the representation of the variant. We are free to choose.

 17. We'll go with the array_agg version because it's more straightforward and avoids delimiter issues.

 18. But note: the problem says "the ordered sequence of activities", and an array is a natural representation.

 19. Also, breaking ties by activity: we do that in the array_agg as well.

 20. We'll write the query accordingly.

 21. However, note: the problem says "return the corresponding events from those filtered cases". We are returning the entire row? Yes, we select all columns from event_log.

 22. We assume that the table event_log has only the three columns? Or more? The problem says "with the following columns", so there might be more? But the problem says "return all events", meaning all rows? And the rows as they are? So we should return all columns? Yes.

 23. Therefore, we write:

        WITH case_variants AS (
            SELECT 
                case_id,
                array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp, activity) as variant_arr
            FROM event_log
            GROUP BY case_id
        ),
        variant_counts AS (
            SELECT 
                variant_arr,
                COUNT(*) as frequency
            FROM case_variants
            GROUP BY variant_arr
            ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant_arr
            LIMIT 5
        ),
        top_cases AS (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM case_variants
            WHERE variant_arr IN (SELECT variant_arr FROM variant_counts)
        )
        SELECT event_log.*
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases)

 24. But note: the IN (SELECT ...) might be inefficient? We can use a join? But DuckDB can optimize it.

 25. Alternatively, we can write:

        SELECT e.*
        FROM event_log e
        WHERE e.case_id IN (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM case_variants
            WHERE variant_arr IN (SELECT variant_arr FROM variant_counts)
        )

    But we defined case_variants and variant_counts in CTEs.

 26. We can also do:

        WITH top_cases AS (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM (
                SELECT 
                    case_id,
                    array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp, activity) as variant_arr
                FROM event_log
                GROUP BY case_id
            ) as case_variants
            WHERE variant_arr IN (
                SELECT variant_arr
                FROM (
                    SELECT 
                        variant_arr,
                        COUNT(*) as frequency
                    FROM (
                        SELECT 
                            case_id,
                            array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp, activity) as variant_arr
                        FROM event_log
                        GROUP BY case_id
                    ) as inner_case_variants
                    GROUP BY variant_arr
                    ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant_arr
                    LIMIT 5
                ) as variant_counts
            )
        )
        SELECT event_log.*
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases)

    But that repeats the case_variants definition? We can use CTEs to avoid repetition.

 27. We'll stick with the first CTE version.

 28. Let me set K=5? The problem says "top K", so we can replace 5 with a parameter? In DuckDB, we can use a parameter? But for the benchmark, we'll assume K is a constant? The problem doesn't specify. We'll write it as a constant.

 29. We'll write the query with LIMIT 5.

 30. Final query:

        WITH case_variants AS (
            SELECT 
                case_id,
                array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp, activity) as variant_arr
            FROM event_log
            GROUP BY case_id
        ),
        variant_counts AS (
            SELECT 
                variant_arr,
                COUNT(*) as frequency
            FROM case_variants
            GROUP BY variant_arr
            ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant_arr
            LIMIT 5
        ),
        top_cases AS (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM case_variants
            WHERE variant_arr IN (SELECT variant_arr FROM variant_counts)
        )
        SELECT event_log.*
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases)

 31. But note: what if there are no events? Then it returns nothing? That's acceptable.

 32. Also, what if there are less than 5 variants? Then we take all? Yes.

 33. We break ties in the ordering of the variant_arr? Yes, by the array itself? So two arrays are compared lexicographically? That's fine.

 34. We break ties in the timestamp by activity? Yes.

 35. We are done.

However, note: the problem says "maintaining the order imposed by timestamp". We broke ties by activity? But the problem doesn't specify how to break ties? So we did it arbitrarily? That's acceptable? Yes.

But if we don't break ties, then the order of events with the same timestamp is arbitrary? Then the variant_arr might be non-deterministic? So we break ties by activity to make it deterministic? That's a good practice.

We'll output the query accordingly.
</think>
Here is a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the specified tasks, including handling ties in timestamps deterministically and efficiently retrieving events for the top K variants:

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp, activity) AS variant_arr
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant_arr,
        COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_arr
    ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant_arr
    LIMIT 5 -- Replace 5 with desired K
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_variants
    WHERE variant_arr IN (SELECT variant_arr FROM variant_counts)
)
SELECT event_log.*
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Case Variants Calculation (`case_variants` CTE)**:
   - Groups events by `case_id`.
   - Uses `array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp, activity)` to create an ordered array of activities for each case. The `activity` in `ORDER BY` ensures deterministic ordering for events with identical timestamps.

2. **Variant Frequency Counting (`variant_counts` CTE)**:
   - Groups variants from `case_variants` by `variant_arr`.
   - Counts cases per variant (`frequency`).
   - Orders variants by frequency (descending) and `variant_arr` (for tie-breaking) and limits to top K (e.g., 5).

3. **Filter Top Cases (`top_cases` CTE)**:
   - Selects `case_id`s belonging to the top K variants identified in `variant_counts`.

4. **Retrieve Final Events**:
   - Joins back to the original `event_log` to return all events for cases in `top_cases`.

### Key Features:
- **Deterministic Order Handling**: Breaks timestamp ties using `activity` to ensure consistent variant identification.
- **Efficient Filtering**: Uses array-based grouping for accurate variant comparison and efficient lookups.
- **Top K Selection**: `LIMIT` with deterministic ordering ensures exactly K variants are selected (adjust K by changing the limit value).
- **Original Event Retention**: Returns all columns from `event_log` for cases matching the top variants.

This query efficiently processes the event log to identify process variants, ranks them by frequency, and retrieves all relevant events while maintaining DuckDB's performance optimizations.
