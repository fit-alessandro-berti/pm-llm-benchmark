To identify anomalies in the given event log, we need to understand the typical sequence of activities in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process. The standard sequence generally follows this order:

1. Create Purchase Requisition
2. Approve Purchase Requisition
3. Issue Purchase Order
4. Receive Goods
5. Vendor Invoice Received
6. Match Invoice to PO
7. Release Payment
8. Close Case

Let's analyze each case to identify any deviations from this standard sequence.

### Case 1001
- **Create Purchase Requisition** (08:00)
- **Approve Purchase Requisition** (08:15)
- **Issue Purchase Order** (09:00)
- **Receive Goods** (02-02 10:00)
- **Vendor Invoice Received** (02-02 11:30)
- **Match Invoice to PO** (02-05 09:00)
- **Release Payment** (02-06 10:00)
- **Close Case** (02-07 15:00)

This case follows the standard sequence correctly.

### Case 1002
- **Create Purchase Requisition** (08:30)
- **Issue Purchase Order** (08:40)  **Anomaly**
- **Vendor Invoice Received** (03-02 07:00)
- **Release Payment** (03-02 07:15)  **Anomaly**
- **Approve Purchase Requisition** (03-02 08:00)  **Anomaly**
- **Receive Goods** (04-02 09:00)
- **Match Invoice to PO** (05-02 08:00)
- **Close Case** (06-02 16:00)

**Anomalies:**
1. **Issue Purchase Order** before **Approve Purchase Requisition**: Normally, a purchase order should not be issued until the purchase requisition is approved.
2. **Release Payment** before **Vendor Invoice Received**: Payments should not be released until the vendor invoice is received.
3. **Approve Purchase Requisition** after **Issue Purchase Order**: This is out of the standard sequence and could lead to discrepancies in the records.

### Case 1003
- **Create Purchase Requisition** (09:00)
- **Approve Purchase Requisition** (09:10)
- **Issue Purchase Order** (10:00)
- **Release Payment** (08-02 11:00)  **Anomaly**
- **Vendor Invoice Received** (09-02 12:00)
- **Receive Goods** (10-02 13:00)
- **Match Invoice to PO** (11-02 14:00)
- **Close Case** (12-02 10:00)

**Anomaly:**
- **Release Payment** before **Vendor Invoice Received**: Payments should not be released until the vendor invoice is received.

### Case 1004
- **Create Purchase Requisition** (10:00)
- **Approve Purchase Requisition** (10:15)
- **Receive Goods** (06-02 09:00)  **Anomaly**
- **Issue Purchase Order** (06-02 09:15)  **Anomaly**
- **Vendor Invoice Received** (07-02 08:00)
- **Match Invoice to PO** (07-02 08:30)
- **Release Payment** (07-02 09:00)
- **Close Case** (08-02 11:00)

**Anomalies:**
1. **Receive Goods** before **Issue Purchase Order**: Goods should not be received until a purchase order is issued.
2. **Issue Purchase Order** after **Receive Goods**: This is out of the standard sequence and could lead to mismatches in inventory and procurement records.

### Summary of Anomalies and Potential Problems:
1. **Case 1002**:
   - **Issue Purchase Order** before **Approve Purchase Requisition**: This could lead to unauthorized purchases and financial discrepancies.
   - **Release Payment** before **Vendor Invoice Received**: This could result in overpayments or payments for goods/services not yet received.
   - **Approve Purchase Requisition** after **Issue Purchase Order**: This could lead to a lack of proper approval controls.

2. **Case 1003**:
   - **Release Payment** before **Vendor Invoice Received**: This could result in overpayments or payments for goods/services not yet received.

3. **Case 1004**:
   - **Receive Goods** before **Issue Purchase Order**: This could lead to mismatches in inventory and procurement records.
   - **Issue Purchase Order** after **Receive Goods**: This is out of the standard sequence and could lead to mismatches in inventory and procurement records.

These anomalies can be problematic because they can lead to financial discrepancies, lack of proper controls, and mismatches in records, which can affect the overall efficiency and accuracy of the Procure-to-Pay process.
