The chart is a parallel coordinates plot that visualizes the process of fines from issuance to collection over time. The x-axis represents the timeline from 2000 to 2013, while the y-axis lists different stages in the fine process: "Send Fine," 'Insert Fine Notification,' and 'Send for Credit Collection.' Each vertical line represents a fine, and the connections between these lines show the progression of each fine through the stages. The chart uses two colors: grey for fines that were not collected and red for fines that were collected. The grey lines dominate the chart, indicating that most fines did not progress to the credit collection stage. The red lines, though fewer, show fines that successfully moved through all stages, ultimately being collected. This visualization highlights the inefficiency in the fine collection process, with a significant number of fines not reaching the credit collection stage, suggesting potential areas for process improvement.
