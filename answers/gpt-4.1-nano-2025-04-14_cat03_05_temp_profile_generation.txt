Certainly! Here's an example of a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the described complex supply chain process. The estimates are based on typical durations and variabilities observed in such processes, covering both direct and more distant activity pairs. The values are approximate and illustrate plausible delays and uncertainties.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected activities with estimated times (in seconds)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 7200),        # Supplier selection to order placement (~1 day)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (43200, 5400),        # Order placement to receiving components (~12 hours)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (21600, 3600),         # Receiving to quality inspection (~6 hours)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (28800, 7200),        # Inspection to assembly (~8 hours)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (28800, 7200),        # Assembly to testing (~8 hours)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 3600),        # Testing to packaging (~4 hours)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 14400),        # Packaging to warehouse storage (~1 day)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 21600),       # Storage to distribution (~1 day)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (172800, 36000),      # Distribution to after-sales support (~2 days)

    # Pairs separated by multiple steps
    ('SS', 'RC'): (129600, 14400),      # Supplier selection to receiving components (~1.5 days)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (172800, 28800),      # Supplier selection to product testing (~2 days)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (129600, 18000),      # Order placement to testing (~1.5 days)
    ('RC', 'PK'): (43200, 7200),        # Receiving to packaging (~12 hours)
    ('QI', 'WS'): (86400, 14400),       # Quality inspection to storage (~1 day)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (86400, 14400),       # Assembly to storage (~1 day)
    ('PT', 'AS'): (259200, 57600),      # Testing to after-sales (~3 days)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (259200, 57600),      # Packaging to after-sales (~3 days)

    # Pairs involving distant activities
    ('SS', 'AS'): (345600, 86400),      # Supplier selection to after-sales (~4 days)
    ('OP', 'WS'): (172800, 43200),      # Order to storage (~2 days)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),      # Receiving to distribution (~2 days)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (207360, 51840),      # Quality inspection to distribution (~2.4 days)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (86400, 14400),       # Assembly to packaging (~1 day)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (172800, 28800),      # Packaging to distribution (~2 days)
}
```

### Explanation:
- The entries include pairs of activities that can occur in sequence or over different paths in the process.
- Times are estimated based on typical durations in supply chain workflows, with some variation to reflect complexity.
- For example:
  - Upstream activities like `SS` to `OP` take about 1 day, with a standard deviation of 2 hours.
  - Longer delays like from `SS` to `AS` (after-sales support) are around 4 days, considering multiple intermediate steps and delays.
  - The standard deviations capture the variability in each phase, accounting for delays, inefficiencies, or variability in real execution traces.

This structure supports analyzing the process's temporal behavior, identifying deviations, and potentially spotting bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
