The visualization represents a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** for an order handling workflow.  
It is divided into four swimlanes — **Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse** — indicating different departments or roles involved in the process.  

Here’s a breakdown of the workflow:

---

### **1. Sales Lane**
- **Start Event**: The process begins on "Monday morning."
- **Check order for completeness**.
- **Check if customer is in the database**:
  - **If not**: Add customer to the database.
  - **If yes**: Continue without adding.
- After order verification, the **Check customer’s order** subprocess ends.
- **Send order details** to the next relevant department.
- When the product is complete and sent, **draft an invoice**.

---

### **2. Production Lane**
- **Start Event**: Triggered when order details arrive.
- **Plan production**.
  - **Gateway decision**: If material is faulty, refer to procurement for materials; if material is not faulty, proceed.
- **Manufacture product**.
- Once complete, notify the Warehouse to send the product.

---

### **3. Procurement Lane**
- **Start Event**: Triggered when order details arrive (if material procurement is needed).
- **Material Compensation Subprocess**:
  - **Order materials**.
  - Possibly trigger a **Return material** activity.
- **Check materials**.
  - If materials fail inspection, trigger **Order Cancellation**.
  - If materials pass inspection, the Production lane activity continues.

---

### **4. Warehouse Lane**
- **Start Event**: Triggered when the product is complete.
- **Send product** to the customer.
- Notify the Sales department that the product is sent.

---

### **Message Flows and Data Objects**
- The diagram shows **message flows** (dotted arrows) to indicate communication between lanes.
- **Data storage symbol**: Represents the customer database in the Sales lane.
- Flow ends in Sales with **invoice drafting**.

---

 **Key Notes**:
- The diagram shows decision-making points with diamond icons (gateways).
- Subprocesses (like "Material Compensation Subprocess") group activities into collapsible blocks.
- The process is collaborative, with dependencies between departments.

If you want, I can also create a **simplified step-by-step textual workflow** from this diagram for easier readability.  
Would you like me to prepare that?
