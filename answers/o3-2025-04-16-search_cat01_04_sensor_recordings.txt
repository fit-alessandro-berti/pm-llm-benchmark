Inferred high-level activities for Machine M1  
(Events that belong to the same activity are written as a contiguous block of event numbers.)

1. Machine Idle / Initialization – Events 1-3  
   • All sensors at baseline: 20-21 °C, 1 bar, 0 Hz vibration, 0 flow, tool at 0 mm, 0.4-0.5 kWh.  
   • Characteristic of a machine powered on but waiting for work.

2. Cutting Metal – Events 4-6  
   • Temperature surges to 50-58 °C and vibration to 30-38 Hz as the cutting tool engages the work-piece.  
   • Material flow jumps to 5 units/s (chips or coolant) while the tool advances 510 mm.  
   • Energy consumption climbs to 3 kWh.  
   • These simultaneous rises in heat, vibration, flow and power are typical signals of a cutting / milling operation.

3. Assembling Parts (clamping & positioning) – Events 7-8  
   • Temperature begins to cool (40 °C) but pressure steps up to 2 bar, suggesting pneumatic clamping.  
   • Vibration drops to a steady 10 Hz and flow falls to 2 units/s (fasteners or adhesive feed).  
   • Tool reaches its assembly position and holds at 15 mm, energy steady at 2 kWh.  
   • The pattern fits a lower-energy, mechanically quieter “put-parts-together” phase after cutting.

4. Welding – Event 9  
   • A single, very distinctive spike: 80 °C, 50 Hz vibration, 0 material flow, pressure still 2 bar, energy peaks at 5 kWh.  
   • High temperature plus high-frequency vibration (arc chatter) with no feed stock is a textbook signature of spot or seam welding.

5. Quality Inspection – Event 10  
   • Sharp cool-down to 30 °C, vibration almost nil (1 Hz), no material flow, energy only 1 kWh.  
   • Indicates a non-intrusive sensor pass (vision or probe) checking the weld.

6. Packaging – Events 11-12  
   • Stable, room-like temperatures (25 °C), light vibration 5 Hz, small but non-zero flow (1 unit/s) as packaging film/tape dispenses.  
   • Tool retreats slightly to 20 mm to reach the packaging fixture, energy around 1.5 kWh.

7. Machine Idle / Reset – Events 13-15  
   • All readings settle back to the original idle baseline: 20-21 °C, 1 bar, 0 Hz, 0 flow, tool at home, <0.5 kWh—ready for the next product cycle.

Method used  
• Temporal clustering: events grouped when sensor values change together and stay within a limited range for 2 consecutive samples.  
• Signature matching: thresholds for “high heat,” “high vibration,” and “material flow” were set from the data’s own maxima/minima, then compared with known manufacturing signatures (e.g., welding = very high temperature + no flow).  
• Transition cues: a step change in two or more key variables (e.g., temperature + vibration) was treated as an activity boundary.
