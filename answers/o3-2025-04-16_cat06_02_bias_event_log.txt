Where bias shows up  
1. Explicit “ScoreAdjustment” step  
   • Every case that lists “Highland Civic Darts Club” receives “+10 (Community)” during PreliminaryScoring.  
   • No other CommunityGroup appears in the log, and applicants who list “None” always receive “0”.  
   • The adjustment is applied mechanically before the case reaches the underwriter, so it systematically changes the numeric basis on which later decisions are made.

2. Interaction with the approval threshold  
   • From the five cases, approval seems to require a final score  700.  
        – C004 starts at 690, is boosted to 700 and is approved.  
        – C003 starts 25 points higher (715) but, lacking the boost, is still rejected.  
   • Thus the +10 bonus can override otherwise higher credit quality.

3. Indirect use of “LocalResident”  
   • Although the column is not used in a visible rule, every applicant who receives the +10 bonus is also a local resident.  
   • If membership in the club is easier for local residents, the CommunityGroup field becomes a proxy for geographic status, creating locationbased disparity.

Why it is biased  
• The bonus is unrelated to the modelled risk of repayment and is only available to a subset of applicants who share a nonfinancial characteristic (membership in a specific club that is itself tied to locality).  
• People who are equally—or more—creditworthy but do not or cannot join that club (new movers, rural residents, people from different cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds) are treated less favourably.  
• The rule violates multiple fairness notions:  
   – Individual fairness: “similar applicants should be treated similarly.”  
   – Group fairness / disparate impact: the treatment correlates with residence and potentially with race, income or age if the club’s membership skews demographically.

Consequences  
• Denial of access to credit for nonclub members despite adequate scores.  
• Incentivises applicants to seek nominal affiliation merely to game the system.  
• Legal and reputational exposure: using placebased or socialaffiliation factors can contravene fairlending and antidiscrimination statutes.

Attributes driving the bias  
• CommunityGroup (triggers the numeric uplift).  
• LocalResident (correlated with CommunityGroup and therefore with the uplift).  
• ManualReview shows no evidence of correcting the bias—the reviewer simply inherits the adjusted score.

Equity implications  
1. Geographic disadvantage: nonlocal or newly arrived residents cannot accrue the bonus.  
2. Socioeconomic exclusion: club fees or social barriers may make membership unattainable for lowerincome or marginalized populations.  
3. Threshold effects: a seemingly small +10 translates into a binary difference (approved vs. rejected).

Summary  
The process embeds a systemic, nonriskbased preference for applicants who are both local and members of a particular community organization. The bias materialises in the ScoreAdjustment field, propagates through the workflow, and ultimately alters credit outcomes. To improve fairness, either remove the communitybased uplift or replace it with factors that demonstrably predict repayment and are equally available to all applicants.
