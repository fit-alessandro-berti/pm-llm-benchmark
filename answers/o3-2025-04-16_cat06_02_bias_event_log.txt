Observed sources of bias in the credit-decision workflow

1. Attributes that carry differential treatment  
   a. LocalResident (TRUE / FALSE)  
   b. CommunityGroup membership (Highland Civic Darts Club vs. None)

2. Step in which the bias first appears  
   PreliminaryScoring  the column “ScoreAdjustment”

3. How the adjustments are applied  
   • Any applicant who is BOTH a local resident AND a member of the named community group receives +10 points.  
   • Applicants who are local residents but do not belong to the group get no uplift.  
   • Non-residents never receive an uplift.

4. How the adjustments flow through to the decision rules  
   • After PreliminaryScoring, the adjusted score is carried unchanged through ManualReview to the Rules Engine.  
   • The Rules Engine appears to apply two different approval cut-offs:  

     – Local residents: Approved if adjusted score  700  
       (C004 is accepted at 700; C001 & C002 at 720)  

     – Non-residents: Approved only if score  740  
       (C005 approved at 740; C003 rejected at 715)

5. Resulting disparate outcomes in the sample log  
   • C004 (resident, club member) starts at 690, is lifted to 700 and is approved.  
   • C003 (non-resident, same general profile, higher raw score 715) receives no uplift and is rejected.  
   • The only difference between C003 and C004 that matters for the decision is geographic residency and club membership, not creditworthiness.  
   • 100 % of club members are approved; only 50 % of non-residents are approved.

6. Why these rules are problematic  
   a. Geographic bias (localism). A higher cut-off for non-residents functions like a red-lining rule: people who live outside the favored area need a higher score to obtain the same product.  
   b. Social-network bias. Membership in the “Highland Civic Darts Club” delivers an unearned 10-point bonus that can single-handedly flip a rejection to an approval (C004). Because social clubs often correlate with age, gender, race, or socioeconomic status, the rule risks indirect discrimination against protected classes that are under-represented in the club.  
   c. Lack of transparency. The decision letter will show only the final score, hiding the subjective uplift and the dual thresholds from the applicant.  
   d. Chilling effect. Applicants without the right postcode or social ties must over-perform on traditional credit signals to reach the higher bar, reducing access to credit for otherwise credit-worthy individuals.

7. Fairness and equity implications  
   • Two people with identical financial profiles face different outcomes solely because one plays darts at the local civic club and the other does not.  
   • Non-residents or people new to the area—often students, immigrants, or lower-income renters—are structurally disadvantaged.  
   • The process can amplify existing societal inequalities by rewarding those already embedded in privileged social networks.

8. Mitigation suggestions  
   • Remove or sharply limit non-credit attributes (LocalResident, CommunityGroup) from any stage that influences the score.  
   • Collapse to a single cut-off score that is applied uniformly to all applicants.  
   • If community incentives are a strategic goal, handle them post-decision as marketing rebates, not as credit-risk factors.  
   • Conduct regular disparate-impact testing to verify that approval rates do not differ significantly across protected classes.  
   • Provide applicants with clear, verifiable reasons for adverse actions, including disclosure of any non-financial factors used.

In summary, bias enters at PreliminaryScoring via a +10 “community” uplift and continues in the Rules Engine through dual score thresholds. These mechanisms confer systematic advantages on local club members and disadvantages on outsiders, undermining both fairness and regulatory compliance.
