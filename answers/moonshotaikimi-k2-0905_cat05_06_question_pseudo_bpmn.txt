1. What objective criteria are used to decide which components qualify for air-freight versus sea-freight, and how often are those criteria re-validated against real market volatility?

2. How does the 24/7 Malaysian assembly plant balance energy costs, labor-shift fatigue, and maintenance windows without creating a single point of failure?

3. When quality checks fail, what data is captured to determine whether a unit is reworked or scrapped, and who arbitrates that decision when suppliers blame each other?

4. How are geopolitical risks—such as Taiwan Strait tensions or South Korea–Japan trade disputes—quantified and then reflected in component-sourcing contracts?

5. What real-time information is shared between R&D, procurement, and assembly so that design changes can still be inserted after components have been ordered but before they are shipped?

6. If cargo-ship lead times stretch unexpectedly, what authority do regional distribution centers have to re-route air-freight capacity without violating annual carbon-emission targets?

7. How is the “VIP/Pre-Orders” channel prevented from cannibalizing retailer allocations, and what governance body settles conflicts when both claim the same finished-goods inventory?

8. What traceability technology (blockchain, serialized QR, etc.) is embedded during pack-and-label to enable end-to-end recalls without unpacking pallets at every hub?

9. How are customs-clearance delays modeled in the sales-forecast algorithm, and who is accountable for demurrage costs when the model is wrong?

10. What KPI threshold triggers the “adjust orders to suppliers” path, and how do suppliers negotiate penalties when forecasts swing from +30 % to –20 % within a single quarter?

11. How does the company measure the carbon footprint of each parallel distribution leg, and how are those metrics exposed to eco-conscious consumers at checkout?

12. What role do local Malaysian labor unions play in approving the 24/7 shift schedule, and how are cultural holidays reconciled with continuous production?

13. When market research signals a feature pivot (e.g., folding screens), what governance gate decides whether to consume already-secured rigid OLED inventory or write it off?

14. How are cyber-risks at foreign ports (e.g., compromised RFID readers) mitigated before containers are loaded onto cargo ships?

15. What financial hedging instruments are layered over component purchases denominated in TWD, JPY, KRW, EUR, and USD to protect margin volatility?

16. How is consumer-rights legislation (e.g., right-to-repair laws in the EU) fed back into design-for-assembly rules so that future rework loops are feasible in local markets?

17. What cross-functional team owns the “End-to-End Sales Cycle” performance scorecard, and how are bonuses clawed back if inventory write-offs exceed forecast error bands?

18. How do VIP customers receive real-time visibility of their direct shipments without exposing the same data to gray-market resellers?

19. What scenario-planning framework is used to test the resilience of the parallel gateway splits/joins when one leg (e.g., air freight) experiences a 70 % price spike overnight?

20. How is knowledge from post-sales monitoring (battery failures, drop-test returns) systematically looped back into both R&D prototype criteria and supplier scorecards?
