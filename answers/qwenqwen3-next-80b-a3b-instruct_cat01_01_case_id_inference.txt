To group the events into distinct **cases** (i.e., individual patient journeys), we need to identify sequences of events that logically belong to the same patient. Since there is no explicit case ID, we must rely on **consistent patient attributes** (age, gender) and **logical workflow progression** (activity sequence, department transitions, timing) to infer groupings.

---

### **Key Observations:**

1. **Patient identity is inferred** by matching:
   - `patient_age`
   - `patient_gender`
   - Consistent `department` transitions (e.g., ER  Radiology  ER  Discharge)
   - Logical activity sequence (e.g., Register  Triage  Consultation  Imaging  Discharge)

2. **Activities follow typical clinical pathways**:
   - **ER Pathway**: Register  Triage  Consultation  (Lab/X-ray)  Discharge
   - **Surgery Pathway**: Register  Consultation  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge
   - Lab/X-ray usually follow triage/consultation, not precede registration

3. **Timestamps** must be in chronological order within a case — events in a single case should not jump backward in time.

4. **Departments** help distinguish cases:
   - ER: Triage, lab requests, ER consultations, ER discharge
   - Surgery: Surgery prep, surgery, recovery, surgery discharge
   - Radiology/Lab: Support activities tied to a patient’s main pathway

### **Step-by-Step Grouping**

Let’s analyze the events in order and look for **repeating patterns of age + gender**.

#### **Event 1**: `Register patient`, age=45, M, ER  
 Candidate for **Case A**

#### **Event 2**: `Register patient`, age=62, F, ER  
 Candidate for **Case B**

#### **Event 3**: `Register patient`, age=28, M, Surgery  
 Candidate for **Case C**

Now we have 3 distinct patient profiles emerging early.

### **Grouping by Patient Attributes and Activity Flow**

---

####  **Case A: Patient Age 45, Male, ER Pathway**

| Event # | Timestamp           | Activity              | Department | additional_info               | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| 1      | 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z | Register patient       | ER         | insurance=private             | Start |
| 4      | 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z | Initial triage         | ER         | triage_code=3                 | Follows register |
| 7      | 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z | X-ray imaging          | Radiology  | body_part=left_leg            | After triage |
| 12     | 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z | Doctor consultation    | ER         | diagnosis=hairline_fracture   | After imaging |
| 15     | 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z | Patient discharged     | ER         | followup=outpatient_clinic    | End |

 **Logical flow**: Register  Triage  Imaging  Consultation  Discharge  
 All events match age=45, M  
 No conflicting events from other patients in between  
 **Confirmed Case A**

####  **Case B: Patient Age 62, Female, ER Pathway**

| Event # | Timestamp           | Activity               | Department | additional_info               | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| 2      | 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z | Register patient       | ER         | insurance=public              | Start |
| 5      | 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z | Initial triage         | ER         | triage_code=2                 | Follows register |
| 8      | 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z | Lab test requested     | ER         | test_type=blood_panel         | After triage |
| 10     | 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z | Lab test completed     | Laboratory | results=normal_levels         | Follows request |
| 11     | 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z | Doctor consultation    | ER         | diagnosis=minor_infection     | After lab results |
| 14     | 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z | Prescription created   | ER         | medication=antibiotics        | After diagnosis |
| 17     | 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z | Patient discharged     | ER         | followup=pharmacy_pickup      | End |

 **Logical flow**: Register  Triage  Lab Request  Lab Completion  Consultation  Prescription  Discharge  
 All events match age=62, F  
 No other patient has this exact sequence  
 **Confirmed Case B**

####  **Case C: Patient Age 28, Male, Surgery Pathway**

| Event # | Timestamp           | Activity               | Department | additional_info                     | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| 3      | 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z | Register patient       | Surgery    | insurance=private                   | Start |
| 6      | 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z | Doctor consultation    | Surgery    | reason=scheduled_knee_surgery       | Immediate — likely pre-op |
| 9      | 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z | Surgery preparation    | Surgery    | prep_type=general_anesthesia        | After consultation |
| 13     | 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z | Surgery performed      | Surgery    | procedure=arthroscopy               | Core event |
| 16     | 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z | Recovery room          | Surgery    | condition=stable                    | Post-op |
| 18     | 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z | Patient discharged     | Surgery    | followup=physiotherapy_sessions     | End |

 **Logical flow**: Register  Consultation  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge  
 All events match age=28, M  
 Surgery department throughout — no ER involvement  
 **Confirmed Case C**

---

### **Why No Other Cases?**

- All 18 events are accounted for in 3 cases.
- No event has conflicting age/gender that would suggest a 4th patient.
- All activity sequences are logically complete and internally consistent.
- No “orphaned” events (e.g., a lab result without a prior request, or discharge without prior consultation).

###  Final Case Groupings:

| Case ID | Patient Age | Patient Gender | Events (Event #s) |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Case A** | 45          | M              | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15   |
| **Case B** | 62          | F              | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 |
| **Case C** | 28          | M              | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 |

###  Bonus: Validation of Chronology Within Cases

- **Case A**: 08:05  08:10  08:15  08:23  08:30   Monotonic
- **Case B**: 08:07  08:12  08:16  08:20  08:22  08:27  08:35   Monotonic
- **Case C**: 08:07  08:13  08:16  08:25  08:27  08:40   Monotonic

All internal timestamps are strictly increasing — no anomalies.

###  Final Answer:

The 18 events belong to **3 distinct patient cases**, grouped as follows:

- **Case A (45M, ER pathway)**: Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
- **Case B (62F, ER pathway)**: Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
- **Case C (28M, Surgery pathway)**: Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

Each case forms a complete, chronologically consistent patient journey with matching demographic attributes and logical clinical workflow.
