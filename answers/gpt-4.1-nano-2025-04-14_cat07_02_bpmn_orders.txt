This visualization depicts a comprehensive business process workflow divided into four main departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. 

1. **Sales:**
   - Begins with checking the customer's order on Monday morning.
   - The process verifies the order's completeness and whether the customer is already in the database.
   - If the customer is new, they are added to the database.
   - The order details are then sent, followed by drafting and sending an invoice.

2. **Production:**
   - Starts with the arrival of order details.
   - Planning production and manufacturing the product follow.
   - The process checks if the product is complete and if materials are non-faulty before proceeding.
   
3. **Procurement:**
   - Initiated with the arrival of order details.
   - The process includes ordering materials, checking materials, and returning faulty materials if necessary.
   - It involves a sub-process called "Material Compensation Subprocess" for managing materials.

4. **Warehouse:**
   - Receives completed products from the production department.
   - Sends the finished product, completing the process.

Overall, the diagram illustrates the flow of orders from sales through production and procurement, culminating in product delivery from the warehouse, emphasizing checks, decision points, and subprocesses guiding each stage.
