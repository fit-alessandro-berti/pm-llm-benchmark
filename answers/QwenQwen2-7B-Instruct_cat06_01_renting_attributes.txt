Determining which attributes are sensitive for fairness in a given dataset typically depends on understanding the legal and contextual frameworks that define what counts as a protected characteristic, such as gender, race, disability, marital status, and so forth. These characteristics are often protected under anti-discrimination laws and should not influence outcomes in decisions or actions made based on data.

Looking at the provided data, the following attributes could potentially be sensitive depending on the legal and societal context:

1. **case:gender**: Gender could be a sensitive attribute if the analysis involves discrimination based on gender, as it aligns with protected characteristics in many jurisdictions.

2. **case:married**: Marital status might be sensitive, especially if the analysis implies or affects any form of discrimination or advantage conferred based on marital status. 

3. **resource**: Certain roles or links marked as 'resource' might be designated as sensitive if the analysis involves discriminatory practices within company hierarchies (for example, if the dataset tracks performance reviews, promotions, or hiring decisions).

4. **concept:name**: Depending on the application of the process described by these actions, one could consider Part R ("Reject Prospective Tenant") as having sensitive implications if it involves discriminatory decision-making in the context of renting or employment.

5. **case:citizen**: Depending on the local laws related to discrimination, citizenship or correct documentation could count as sensitive if it influences legal decisions or opportunities for services and rights within a country.

6. **start_timestamp** and **time** or **time:timestamp** might not be inherently sensitive, but if the grouping or utilization of these attributes can reveal patterns of discrimination in time (e.g., if discrimination is observed when data is analyzed by certain times or sequences of events), then they could indirectly reveal or exacerbate sensitive matters.

In general, the fairness of a system applied to this dataset would need to account for these potentially sensitive attributes and ensure that decision-making processes do not exhibit bias or discrimination. Techniques for ensuring fairness might include statistical testing for disparate impact, implementing transparency and accountability in algorithmic decision processes, and periodically reviewing policies to ensure they remain effective and equitable.
