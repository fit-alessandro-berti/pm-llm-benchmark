The provided visualization consists of three parts:

(a) Two product classes connected through two channels - This diagram shows how two different product classes (lab test and order entry) are connected via two channels (HIS and HL7).

(b) Class diagram containing the two product classes - This expanded diagram shows more details about the lab test and order entry classes, their attributes, and relationships. It includes elements like perform test, receive result, judge result, make report, etc.

(c) Example of a performative - This table provides an example of the information exchanged in a performative (a single communication) between the classes. It specifies the time, channel, sender, receivers, action, content, scope and direction of the communication.

Overall, the visualization illustrates how two related parts of a system (likely a healthcare information system) interact and exchange information using a formally defined protocol. The class diagram provides the structural view while the performative example demonstrates the dynamic communication aspect.
