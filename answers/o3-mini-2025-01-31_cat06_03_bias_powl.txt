The key point about the XOR branching in the model is that it creates two distinct pathways after the preliminary scoring (C): one that explicitly checks for local affiliation (D) and one that immediately skips this check. Although at first glance this may seem like a neutral design decision to allow flexibility in the decision process, it actually introduces a subtle advantage for applicants who fall into the “local affiliation” category. Here’s why:

1. Incremental Scoring Benefit: The pathway that includes the local affiliation check (D) may provide extra information that, when favorable, can positively affect the overall credit evaluation. In contrast, applicants who do not have local affiliation don’t get this additional step, which means they miss out on a potential score uplift. This generates an incremental benefit for those belonging to the non-protected group that is associated with the local community.

2. Procedural Bias: Even if local affiliation is not a legally protected attribute, embedding it as a branching criterion effectively signals that being a local has value in the decision process. The design may inadvertently prioritize applicants from certain social or economic backgrounds (for example, those with ties to established or dominant communities). Over time, this could reinforce existing imbalances by giving those with local association a systematic edge in borderline cases.

3. Impact on Fairness and Equity: When one branch of a process is designed to potentially “boost” the chances of favorable decisions (e.g., through a subtle score uplift or favorable consideration), it creates a scenario in which fairness is compromised. Applicants who do not benefit from this extra step—despite being equally qualified in other respects—may be unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. The process may, therefore, result in inequities in the final loan decisions.

4. Implications for the Decision Workflow: In practice, a decision-maker faces the XOR decision: check local affiliation or simply skip the step. Even if the rule is applied uniformly, the outcome will be that only those with the local affiliation benefit from review details like community membership. When this can tip the scales in close decisions, it means that even a non-legally protected characteristic is being used to decide financial outcomes, thus having the potential to perpetuate or amplify social and economic inequalities.

In summary, the XOR branch that offers the local affiliation check (D) introduces bias by providing an extra evaluative step only to a subset of applicants. Although the feature may seem benign at the outset, it carries substantial implications: it creates an incremental advantage for those with a local affiliation, raises questions about procedural fairness, and ultimately risks skewing the final loan decisions in favor of applicants who already belong to a more established or advantaged group. This poses serious challenges to maintaining equity in the decision process, even when the biased factor is not legally protected.
