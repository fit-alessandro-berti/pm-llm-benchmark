If you take a textbook “hiretoretire” as a straightthrough case, the controlflow is essentially linear:

```
Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close
```

There are no branches: you don’t pay or close before you’ve actually hired someone, and you don’t make a hiring decision before you’ve gathered enough information.

Against that yardstick:

- In `model1` all seven activities are present and, because it is a `StrictPartialOrder`, all of them must occur exactly once. The post–screen–decide/onboard–payroll–close chain is intact. However, the only constraints on `Conduct_Interviews` are “after Post_Job_Ad” via `Screen`. There is no edge `InterviewDecide`, so `Make_Hiring_Decision` can be interleaved with, or even precede, the interviews. In an extreme linearisation you can even close the case and only then perform `Conduct_Interviews`, because `Interview` is not related to `Close` at all. That breaks the normal logic that you interview before deciding and certainly before onboarding and closing.

- In `model2` the decision is correctly ordered after `Conduct_Interviews` (`InterviewDecide`), and interviews must therefore precede onboarding and closure. But `Screen_Candidates` is not in that chain at all: it is only constrained to follow `Post_Job_Ad`, so screening can be done in parallel with or after interviewing, after the decision, or even after closure. There are two additional structural deviations: onboarding sits in a loop, so you can reonboard the same hire, and the payroll step is under an XOR with a silent “skip”, making salary setup optional. That allows a case to be closed without ever adding the employee to the payroll, which fundamentally contradicts the “toretire” part of the process.

Both models thus diverge from the normative flow, but in different ways. Model1’s main anomaly is the missing precedence between interviews and the decision, which can lead to premature decisions or belated interviews. Model2 loosens the early stages even further and, more seriously, makes payroll optional and onboarding repeatable.

On balance, model1 is closer to the standard hiretoretire: it retains all of the essential activities as mandatory and keeps payroll and case closure at the end of the chain. Model2 allows you to skip paying the new employee and to perform screening after closure, which is a more fundamental integrity violation despite correctly ordering the decision after interviews.
