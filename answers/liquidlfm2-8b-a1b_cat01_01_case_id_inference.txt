The sequence consists of 18 events from multiple distinct patient cases. Each case follows a coherent clinical trajectory involving Emergency Room (ER) registration, diagnostic evaluation, department-specific care (Surgery or ER follow-up), diagnostic testing, diagnosis, intervention, and discharge. We infer case groupings by analyzing **patient consistent clinical arcs, overlapping resources within departments, temporal progression, and shared attributes**, even without direct case IDs.

### **Methodology for grouping:**

- **Register patient events** begin each case and are marked as initial entry into the system.  
- **Activities** are processed in logical sequence per patient.  
- **Department membership** isolates cases into ER or Surgery.  
- **Patient age and gender** help distinguish distinct individuals.  
- **Activity/timewise flow** supports grouping (e.g., surgical cases occur after ER registration and imaging).  
- **Shared intermediary events** (e.g., triage, diagnosis, procedure) help confirm same-case continuity.

### **Summary of Inferred Case Groupings:**

| Case ID | Patient(s)                          | Department (per dominant activity) | Clinical Focus               |
|---------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Case 1  | Patient 45M                        | ER  Surgery                       | Trauma  Surgical repair     |
| Case 2  | Patient 62F                        | ER  Surgery (knee arthroscopy)    | Surgical intervention + recovery laparem |
| Case 3  | Patient 28M                        | ER  Surgery (knee arthroscopy)    | Surgical intervention + recovery |  
| Case 4  | Patient 62F                        | ER (lab work + infection)          | Lab diagnostics, minor infection |

> Despite differing triage codes and one diagnostic shift in Case 4, all identifiable individuals in **similar temporal and departmental clusters** and sharing core clinical events are grouped under dedicated case IDs.

---

### **Conclusion:**

The data represents **4 major case streams**, each corresponding to a distinct patient trajectory with clear clinical timelines. No interleaving across cases is evident, and events are appropriately clustered by:  
- **Same patient**: Shared timestamps, overlapping departments, similar resources.  
- **Logical clinical progression**: Registration  Triage  Testing  Diagnosis  Treatment  Discharge.  
- **Shared departmental logic**: ER vs. Surgery.

Thus, the **inferred case groupings are 4 exclusive cases** labeled Case 1–4 by chronological segmentation based on event sequences.
