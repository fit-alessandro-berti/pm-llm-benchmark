The two logs differ not because of differing score ranges or rulesengine thresholds, but because of who gets a “community boost.”  In Group A (Protected), nobody ever receives a non-zero ScoreAdjustment.  In Group B (Unprotected), every applicant who (a) is a LocalResident and (b) belongs to a CommunityGroup gets +10 points.  That single policy decision creates a systematic advantage:

1. ScoreAdjustment patterns  
   – Group A (Protected): all adjustments are 0.  
   – Group B (Unprotected): U001 and U003 get +10 “Community Boost,” U002 (no group) gets 0.

2. Downstream effects on final decisions  
   – In Group A, P002 with raw 710 is rejected, even though 710<720 would have been boosted if the rule existed.  
   – In Group B, U003 starts at 695 but is boosted to 705 and still approved—despite having a lower raw score than P002.  
   – U001 (raw 720730) sails through even more comfortably.

3. Role of LocalResident & CommunityGroup  
   – All Group B cases are LocalResident=TRUE; none in Group A are.  
   – Only those marked TRUE and tied to a community organization enjoy the +10.  
   – Those two attributes thus act as proxies to funnel preferential treatment exclusively to the unprotected group.

Because Protected-group applicants can never trigger the +10 boost, the algorithm systematically favors Unprotected applicants with identical or even worse raw scores.  That disparity in ScoreAdjustment—and the resulting shift in final approvals—constitutes clear bias against the protected group.
