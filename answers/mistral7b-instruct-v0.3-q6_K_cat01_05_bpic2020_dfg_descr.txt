 This data describes a business process workflow for financial approvals and payments, involving several roles such as Employee, Pre-Approver, Administrator, Budget Owner, Supervisor, and Missing. The workflow can be broken down into the following steps:

1. An employee declares a final approved status (FINAL_APPROVED) for some expense or claim. This declaration is reviewed by the supervisor.

   - Frequency: 5133 times, Performance: 164330.770
   - Employee -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR

2. If the declaration is rejected by the supervisor, the employee resubmits it (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

   - Frequency: 60 times, Performance: 56000.033
   - Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE

3. If the declaration is rejected by an employee, they resubmit it for their own approval (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

   - Frequency: 7 times, Performance: 17.143
   - Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE

4. An employee can save a declaration (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE), which then initiates a request for payment (Request Payment).

   - Frequency: 1 time, Performance: 1471681.000
   - Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment

5. If a declaration is rejected, it can be resubmitted as a request for approval (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, or ADMINISTRATION).

   - Frequency: Multiple times (unclear), Performance varies
   - Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE or Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR/PRE_APPROVER/ADMINISTRATION

6. After a declaration is approved, a payment can be handled (Payment Handled). However, this step has an inconsistent relationship with the workflow, as it's shown both as a direct result of a declaration and also as a consequence of a rejected declaration by an employee.

   - Frequency: Multiple times (unclear), Performance varies
   - Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled or Request Payment -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Payment Handled or Payment Handled -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Payment Handled

7. If a request for payment is rejected, it can be resubmitted (Request Payment).

   - Frequency: 1 time, Performance: 598089.000
   - Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment

8. During the workflow, there are situations where a declaration or payment is not processed for some reason (Declaration REJECTED by MISSING). In these cases, the employee resubmits the declaration or request (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

   - Frequency: Multiple times (unclear), Performance varies
   - Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR/PRE_APPROVER/ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE or Request Payment -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Request Payment

9. If a payment is handled, the employee can mark it as rejected (Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE). In this case, the workflow doesn't specify further actions.

   - Frequency: 1 time, Performance: 140424.000
   - Payment Handled -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE

This workflow demonstrates a process where employees submit expense or claim declarations for approval by various roles (Supervisor, Pre-Approver, Administrator, and Budget Owner). After approval, payments are handled. Rejections can lead to resubmissions, and there are instances where declarations/payments are not processed for unknown reasons.
