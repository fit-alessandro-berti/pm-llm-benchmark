 The provided data represents a workflow process involving multiple stages and decision points, primarily focused on the approval of declarations and the subsequent request for payment. Here's a simplified description of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The supervisor reviews the declaration and either approves it (Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR) or rejects it (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR). If approved, the declaration moves to the next step; if rejected, the employee can resubmit the declaration.
3. If the declaration is approved, it proceeds through a series of approval stages:
   - Administration (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION)
   - Budget Owner (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER)
   - Pre-approver (Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER)
4. Once the declaration receives final approval from the supervisor, it proceeds to payment handling (Payment Handled).
5. If the declaration is rejected at any stage, it returns to the employee for revision or resubmission.
6. During the payment handling step, a request for payment is made (Request Payment).
7. In some cases, a declaration may be saved by the employee before submission (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE) and can be later submitted when ready.
8. The data also indicates that there's an intermediate state called Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by [Supervisor/Pre-approver/Administration], which may represent a pending approval status before final decision making.
9. It seems that there are some exceptions in the process:
   - A missing party (DECLARATION REJECTED by MISSING) can also reject the declaration, and in some cases, it may return to the employee for resubmission.
   - In one instance, a request for payment is initiated directly from the rejected declaration by the supervisor (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment).
10. There's an additional flow where an employee requests payment, and then the payment is handled without any prior approval of declarations (Request Payment -> Payment Handled). However, it seems that this specific flow has a single occurrence in the data provided.
