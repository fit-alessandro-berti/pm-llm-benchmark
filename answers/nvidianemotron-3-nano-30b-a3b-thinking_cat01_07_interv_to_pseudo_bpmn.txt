We need to produce a BPMN-like textual process model based on these interview excerpts. Should include activities, sequence flow, gateways, roles, artifacts, exceptions/variations, and note uncertainties. Provide clear structured textual representation that could be turned into diagram. So output should be textual description of process, like using BPMN elements: Start Event -> Tasks, Exclusive Gateway, etc. Include participants: Purchase Dept, Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen). Artifacts: Invoice, Purchase Order (PO), Confirmation, Approval, etc. Also include inputs/outputs.

We should consolidate contradictory accounts: Maybe differences about who triggers manager approval, who can approve, handling of missing PO, etc. Indicate uncertainty where needed.

We should produce a step-by-step textual BPMN model. Could use notation like:

[Start] -> (Receive Invoice) -> Exclusive Gateway (PO present?) -> (Check PO) -> (Log Invoice) -> (Forward to Purchasing) -> (Confirm Receipt) -> Exclusive Gateway (Match PO?) -> ... etc.

Let's craft a thorough answer.

**BPMNlike textual model of the “InvoicetoPayment” process**  
*(derived from the five stakeholder interviews above)*  

---

### 1.  Participants (Pools / Lanes)

| Role / Department                     | Typical System / Tool mentioned |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **AP Clerk (Mary)** – Accounts Payable| Accounting / Invoicecapture system |
| **Purchasing Officer (Dan)** – Purchasing | PO lookup & validation tool |
| **Department Manager (Carlos)** – Finance/Budget | Approval workflow in the ERP |
| **AP Supervisor (Rita)** – Accounts Payable Management | Exceptionhandling console |
| **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** – Procurement/Procurement Services | Supplierportal / contract database |
| **System** – ERP / AP system (triggers emails, runs workflow) | – |

---

### 2.  Core Activities (Tasks) – textual BPMN elements  

| BPMNstyle label (suggested) | Description (who does what) | Primary artifacts involved |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Start Event**                | Invoice receipt (usually by email) | Invoice (electronic) |
| **Task: Validate PO Reference** | AP clerk checks whether invoice contains a valid PO number. <br> *If **no PO***  **Task: Return to Supplier (via email)** (restart loop). | Purchase Order (PO) reference |
| **Task: Log Invoice in ERP**   | AP clerk records invoice in the accounting system. | Logged invoice record |
| **Task: Forward to Purchasing**| AP clerk forwards logged invoice to Purchasing for receipt confirmation. | Forwarded invoice (systemgenerated notification) |
| **Task: Confirm Goods/Services Received** | Purchasing officer opens PO, validates that the ordered items were actually received. <br> *If receipt not confirmed*  **Task: Escalate to AP Supervisor** (optional). | Receipt confirmation (internal status) |
| **Task: Match Invoice  PO**   | AP clerk (or Purchasing) compares invoice lineitems with PO lineitems (quantity, price, delivery charges). | Invoice, PO, lineitem match |
| **Gateway: Match Outcome?**    | **Exclusive Gateway** – outcome of the match. | – |
| **Path A – Match Success**  **Task: Route to Manager for Approval** | System autoemails Department Manager with request for signoff. | Approval request (ERP workflow) |
| **Path B – Match Failure**  **Task: Create Discrepancy Ticket** | AP clerk emails Purchasing (or Supervisor) to request clarification / correction. | Email / discrepancy ticket |
| **Task: Escalate (if needed)**| If discrepancy cannot be resolved quickly, AP clerk escalates to AP Supervisor. | Escalation notice |
| **Task: Manager Approval**    | Department Manager reviews matched invoice, PO, and confirmation. <br> *If suspicious*  **Task: Reject or Hold** (loop back to AP Supervisor). | Approval action (system “Approve” click) |
| **Gateway: Approve?**         | **Exclusive Gateway** – manager’s decision. | – |
| **Path Approve  Task: Schedule Payment** | After approval, invoice is added to the next payment run (AP clerk schedules payment). | Scheduled payment entry |
| **Path Reject/Hold  Task: Exception Resolution** | Invoice goes to AP Supervisor (or Karen) for special handling (create PO, contact supplier, etc.). | Exception case file |
| **Task: Exception Resolution** | AP Supervisor contacts supplier (via Karen), creates a retrospective PO, or decides to reject. | New PO / supplier clarification |
| **Task: Return to Normal Flow**| After exception resolution, invoice reenters the normal flow at “Match Invoice  PO”. | – |
| **End Event**                | Payment is executed (payment run). | Payment transaction |

---

### 3.  Sequence Flow (order of execution)

1. **Start** – Invoice arrives.  
2. **Validate PO Reference?**  If **no PO**, send back to supplier (loop).  
3. **Log Invoice** in ERP.  
4. **Forward to Purchasing** for receipt confirmation.  
5. **Purchasing confirms receipt** (via PO status).  
6. **Match Invoice  PO** (quantity & price).  
7. **Exclusive Gateway – Match Result?**  
   - **Success**  Continue to **Manager Approval**.  
   - **Failure**  **Discrepancy Ticket  Email Purchasing** (or directly to Supervisor).  
8. **Manager Approval Request** (system autoemail).  
9. **Manager Approval?**   
   - **Approve**  **Schedule Payment**.  
   - **Reject/Hold**  **Exception Resolution** (to AP Supervisor).  
10. **Exception Resolution** (contact supplier, create PO, etc.).  
11. **Resume at “Match Invoice  PO”** after exception cleared.  
12. **End** – Payment scheduled and executed.

---

### 4.  Gateways / Decision Points (BPMNstyle)

| Gateway name | Type (suggested) | Trigger condition | Description |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **G1 – PO Reference** | Exclusive | Invoice received | Determines whether invoice has a valid PO. |
| **G2 – Match Result** | Exclusive | After POinvoice lineitem comparison | Decides if the match succeeded or a discrepancy exists. |
| **G3 – Manager Approval** | Exclusive | After successful match & manager notification | Determines manager’s decision (approve vs. reject/hold). |
| **G4 – Exception Escalation** | Exclusive | When discrepancy cannot be resolved by Purchasing or manager | Routes to AP Supervisor for special handling. |

*Note*: The interview data sometimes treats **Purchasing** as the gatekeeper for the “hold” decision (Dan says he can tell Mary to “hold” the invoice) while Mary mentions the **manager** as the trigger point. The model therefore places **G2** after the match, with two possible outflows: a normal path to the manager or an escalated path to the supervisor. The exact ownership of the “hold” task is fuzzy and is marked as uncertain.

---

### 5.  Artifacts / Data Objects (Inputs / Outputs)

| Artifact | Origin / Destination | Description |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Invoice (electronic)** | External (supplier email)  AP Clerk | Primary input to the process. |
| **Purchase Order (PO) reference** | Created by Purchasing; used by AP & Purchasing | Validation key. |
| **Receipt confirmation** | Purchasing  AP Clerk | Needed before matching. |
| **Logged invoice record** | AP Clerk  ERP | State of the invoice. |
| **Matching result (Match / Discrepancy)** | AP Clerk / Purchasing | Outcome of lineitem comparison. |
| **Approval request email** | System  Department Manager | Triggers manager decision. |
| **Approval decision (Approve / Reject)** | Manager  System (or AP Clerk) | Moves the invoice forward. |
| **Payment scheduling entry** | AP Clerk  Finance/Payment run | Endofprocess output. |
| **Exception ticket / Hold notice** | AP Clerk  Purchasing / Supervisor | Triggers exception handling. |
| **Suppllier clarification / Corrected invoice** | Supplier (via Karen)  AP / Purchasing | Resolution input for exceptions. |
| **Retrospective PO / Adjusted PO** | AP Supervisor / Karen  AP Clerk | May be created during exception resolution. |
| **Payment execution record** | Finance  Accounting | Final output. |

---

### 6.  Roles / Participants (who performs each activity)

| Activity | Primary Owner(s) | Supporting / Secondary actors |
|----------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Validate PO Reference | **AP Clerk (Mary)** | Supplier (if PO missing). |
| Log Invoice | **AP Clerk** | – |
| Forward to Purchasing | **AP Clerk** | – |
| Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services | **Purchasing Officer (Dan)** | – |
| Match Invoice  PO | **AP Clerk** (often) & **Purchasing Officer** (verification) | – |
| Manager Approval | **Department Manager (Carlos)** | – |
| Escalate / Create Discrepancy Ticket | **AP Clerk**  **Purchasing** or **Supervisor** | – |
| Escalation to Supervisor | **AP Clerk**  **AP Supervisor (Rita)** | – |
| Exception Resolution (supplier contact) | **AP Supervisor (Rita)** (coordinates) & **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** (provides contract info) | – |
| Schedule Payment | **AP Clerk** | – |
| Payment Execution | **Finance / Payment Run Team** | – |

---

### 7.  Exception / Variation paths (as described in the interviews)

| Exception scenario | How it is handled (according to interview excerpts) | Where the flow diverges |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Missing PO number** | Invoice is sent back to supplier requesting a PO; process loops until a PO is provided. | **G1** – “no PO” path leads back to Start. |
| **InvoicePO mismatch (price/quantity)** | AP clerk notifies Purchasing; if not resolved quickly, the issue is escalated to the AP Supervisor. | **G2 – Failure**  “Discrepancy Ticket”  possible **Exception Escalation** to Rita. |
| **Discrepancy cannot be resolved** | Supervisor Rita contacts supplier, may create a retrospective PO, or decides to reject. | **G4 – Exception**  “Exception Resolution”, then reenter at **Match** step. |
| **Manager rejects or flags suspicious amounts** | Invoice is held; AP clerk must either obtain clarification or route to supervisor. | **G3 – Reject**  “Exception Resolution”. |
| **Serviceonly invoices without PO** | No PO exists; AP Supervisor works with department head to create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice. | **G1 – no PO** but handled by Supervisor rather than simple loop. |
| **Supplier fails to provide corrected invoice** | Issue stays in “exception” state; may eventually be rejected or escalated further (not detailed). | End of normal flow; possible **process stop**. |

*Uncertainty note*: The interviews do not provide a single consistent sequence for **who initiates the “hold”** (Dan says he can tell Mary to hold; Mary says she receives a systemgenerated email requesting manager approval; Carlos says he gets a notification after Purchasing confirms). The model therefore shows both possibilities and flags the ownership of the “hold” decision as ambiguous.

### 8.  Consolidated textual BPMN representation  

Below is a concise, structured description that can be copied directly into a diagramming tool (e.g., Camunda Modeler, Signavio, Bizagi) as **BPMN XMLcompatible element names** or as a narrative for manual drawing.

```
Process Start Event: Receive Invoice
   |
   v
Task: Validate PO Reference
   |
   +--Exclusive Gateway: PO Present?
        |--No --> Task: Return to Supplier (Email) --> (Loop back to Receive Invoice)
        |--Yes --> Task: Log Invoice in ERP
               |
               v
               Task: Forward to Purchasing (Notification)
               |
               v
               Task: Confirm Goods/Services Received (Purchasing)
               |
               v
               Task: Match Invoice  PO (Quantity, Price, Charges)
               |
               +--Exclusive Gateway: Match Successful?
                    |--Yes --> Task: Route to Manager for Approval (System Email)
                    |          |
                    |          +--Task: Manager Approval?
                    |                |
                    |                +--Exclusive Gateway: Approve?
                    |                |      |--Yes --> Task: Schedule Payment (Add to Payment Run) --> Process End
                    |                |      |--No  --> Task: Reject / Hold --> Exception Resolution (see below) --> (Loop back to Match step after resolution)
                    |                |
                    |                +--Reject/Hold --> Exception Resolution
                    |
                    |--No (Match Failure) --> Task: Create Discrepancy Ticket
                                         |
                                         +--Task: Email Purchasing / Hold Request (may be done by AP Clerk)
                                         |
                                         +--Optional: Escalate to AP Supervisor (if unresolved) --> Exception Resolution
                                         |
                                         -> (Connector to Exception Resolution) --> (Loop back to Match step after PO creation / supplier clarification)
```

**Exception Resolution Subprocess** (executed when the flow follows the “No” or “Reject/Hold” branch):

```
Task: Contact Supplier (via Supplier Relationship Manager) for clarification
Task: Retrieve / Create Retrospective PO (AP Supervisor)
Task: Resolve Discrepancy (email exchange, contract check)
   |
   +--If resolved --> Reenter Process at "Match Invoice  PO"
   |
   +--If unresolved --> Remain in Exception state (possible rejection)
```

---

### 9.  Points of Uncertainty / Ambiguity (to be documented in the diagram)

| Symbol | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **** next to “Manager Approval?” gateway | Interview accounts differ: Mary receives a systemgenerated email requesting manager signoff; Dan says he can “hold” the invoice himself; Carlos says he only sees the request after Purchasing confirms. The authority to **hold** the invoice is not fully consistent. |
| **** next to “Match Invoice  PO” step | Both AP clerk and Purchasing claim responsibility for the matching; occasional mention of “lineitem verification” by Dan without explicit AP involvement. |
| **** on “Exception Escalation” path | It is unclear whether the escalation always goes to the Supervisor first or can bypass directly to Karen (Supplier Manager). The flow assumes a supervisor step but the interview does not state this is mandatory. |
| **** on “Retrospective PO creation” | Only Rita mentions creating a PO for nonPO invoices; Karen says she can only advise. The exact ownership of PO creation is uncertain. |

These ambiguities are noted in the model so that a BPMN designer can decide how to represent them (e.g., using **eventbased gateways**, **manual tasks**, or **subprocesses** with appropriate annotations).

### 10.  Summary (what you can handoff to a BPMN modeler)

- **Pools/Lanes:** AP Clerk, Purchasing, Department Manager, AP Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager, System.
- **Main tasks** (with suggested BPMN IDs): *Receive Invoice*, *Validate PO*, *Log Invoice*, *Forward to Purchasing*, *Confirm Receipt*, *Match Invoice  PO*, *Gateway: Match Outcome*, *Gateway: Manager Approval*, *Schedule Payment*, *Exception Resolution*, *Contact Supplier*, *Create PO*, *Reject*.
- **Gateways:** Four exclusive gateways (PO present?, Match success?, Manager approval?, Exception escalation?).
- **Artifacts:** Invoice, PO, Receipt confirmation, Matched record, Approval request, Scheduled payment, Exception ticket.
- **Roles:** Explicitly map each task to the stakeholder(s) quoted.
- **Variations:** Document the three exception paths (missing PO, discrepancy, manager rejection) and note where the process loops back to matching or terminates.

The textual model above captures all activities, flows, decision points, participants, data objects, and exception branches identified in the interview excerpts, while flagging the areas where stakeholder accounts diverge or lack clarity. It should enable a BPMN designer to produce a precise diagrammatic representation without major ambiguities.
