# Process Mining and Queue Mining Approach to Improve Patient Throughput in a Multi-Specialty Outpatient Clinic

---

## 1. Queue Identification and Characterization

### **1.1 Calculating Waiting Times Between Activities**
In the context of outpatient clinic operations, **"waiting time"** is defined as the time elapsed between the **completion of one activity** and the **start of the next activity** in the patient's journey. This represents the idle time a patient spends waiting for the next step in their visit.

Using the event log data, waiting times can be calculated as follows:

For each patient visit (Case ID), and for each consecutive pair of activities (A1  A2):

```
Waiting Time (A1  A2) = Timestamp(START of A2) - Timestamp(COMPLETE of A1)
```

This approach ensures that we capture **inter-activity delays**, which are not caused by the activity itself but by queuing or coordination issues.

### **1.2 Key Metrics to Characterize Queues**

To analyze and compare the severity of different queues, the following metrics are calculated for each activity pair:

- **Average Waiting Time**: Provides an overall view of the typical delay.
- **Median Waiting Time**: Less sensitive to outliers, shows the central tendency.
- **Maximum Waiting Time**: Highlights worst-case scenarios.
- **90th Percentile Waiting Time**: Indicates the experience of the worst 10% of patients.
- **Queue Frequency**: How often a particular queue occurs (e.g., how many patients encounter this wait).
- **Number of Cases with Excessive Waits**: Patients waiting longer than a defined threshold (e.g., >30 minutes).

### **1.3 Prioritizing Critical Queues**

To identify the **most critical queues**, we apply a **multi-criteria prioritization framework**:

- **Severity**: Long average or high percentile waiting times (e.g., 90th percentile > 25 minutes).
- **Frequency**: High number of patients affected by the queue.
- **Impact on Patient Type or Urgency**: Queues that disproportionately affect urgent patients or new patients (who may be more sensitive to satisfaction issues).
- **Process Position**: Queues early in the process (e.g., after registration) can compound delays for downstream steps.

**Example:** If the queue between "Nurse Assessment" and "Doctor Consultation" has a 90th percentile waiting time of 45 minutes and affects 80% of patients, it would be flagged as a high-priority bottleneck.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### **2.1 Potential Root Causes of Queues**

#### **Resource Bottlenecks**
- **Staff Shortages**: For example, only one nurse on duty during peak hours leads to long waits for Nurse Assessment.
- **Room or Equipment Constraints**: Diagnostic equipment (e.g., ECG machine) may be overused or under-maintained, causing delays.

#### **Activity Dependencies and Handovers**
- Poor coordination between staff roles (e.g., doctor not ready when nurse finishes) leads to idle patient time.
- Lack of standardized handover protocols between departments.

#### **Variability in Activity Durations**
- High variability in service times (e.g., doctor consultation times ranging from 10 to 45 minutes) causes unpredictable delays.

#### **Appointment Scheduling Policies**
- Fixed time slots not aligned with actual service duration needs (e.g., 15-minute slots for 25-minute average consultations).
- No buffer between appointments for variability.

#### **Patient Arrival Patterns**
- Clustering of patient arrivals at the start of the day or after lunch leads to temporary overloading.

#### **Patient Type and Urgency Differences**
- Urgent patients may be prioritized, causing delays for others.
- New patients may take longer to register or require more assessments, affecting throughput.

### **2.2 Process Mining Techniques to Diagnose Root Causes**

- **Resource Utilization Analysis**: Identify overutilized or underutilized staff/rooms.
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Highlight steps with high waiting times and low throughput.
- **Variant Analysis**: Compare different patient flow paths to identify deviations from standard processes.
- **Conformance Checking**: Compare actual process with ideal model to detect deviations.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Identify communication or coordination inefficiencies between staff roles.

## 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### **3.1 Strategy 1: Dynamic Staff Scheduling Based on Patient Flow Patterns**

**Targeted Queue:** Between "Registration" and "Nurse Assessment", and "Nurse Assessment" and "Doctor Consultation".

**Root Cause Addressed:** Resource bottlenecks and mismatched staffing levels during peak hours.

**Data Support:**
- Analysis of hourly patient arrival rates and staff utilization shows under-resourcing during peak hours (e.g., 9–11 AM).
- Nurse utilization peaks at 95%, while doctor utilization is at 80%, indicating imbalance.

**Action:**
- Introduce **flexible shift scheduling** where additional nurses and clerks are scheduled during high-demand periods.
- Use **historical data** to model optimal staff-to-patient ratios.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce average waiting time between registration and nurse assessment by 30–40%.
- Improve throughput by 15–20%.

---

### **3.2 Strategy 2: Redesign Appointment Slotting with Variable Durations**

**Targeted Queue:** Between "Nurse Assessment" and "Doctor Consultation", especially for new patients.

**Root Cause Addressed:** Inflexible appointment scheduling and variability in consultation times.

**Data Support:**
- Analysis shows that new patients take 25% longer in consultations than follow-up patients.
- Standard 15-minute slots are insufficient for specialists like cardiologists (average 28 minutes).

**Action:**
- Implement **adaptive scheduling**:
  - Allocate longer slots for new patients and specialists.
  - Introduce **buffer slots** after complex cases.
- Use **machine learning models** to predict consultation duration based on patient type, specialty, and historical data.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce waiting time before doctor consultations by 25%.
- Decrease overtime or delays by 35%.

---

### **3.3 Strategy 3: Parallelize Non-Dependent Activities and Introduce Pre-Visit Tasks**

**Targeted Queue:** Between "Doctor Consultation" and "Diagnostic Tests".

**Root Cause Addressed:** Sequential dependencies and lack of parallel processing.

**Data Support:**
- Process mining reveals that diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG) often start only after the doctor's order, creating a dependency.
- Some tests could be **pre-scheduled** or initiated **before** the doctor's decision, especially for high-probability cases.

**Action:**
- Redesign the workflow to allow **pre-ordering of tests** for patients with predictable conditions (e.g., chest pain  ECG).
- Introduce **parallel activities** where possible (e.g., nurse can prepare blood draw while doctor consults).

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce post-consultation waiting time by 20–30%.
- Shorten overall visit duration by 15%.

## 4. Trade-offs and Constraints

### **4.1 Potential Trade-offs**

- **Shifting Bottlenecks**: Adding more nurses may move the bottleneck to doctors or diagnostic departments.
- **Cost Implications**: Hiring or scheduling additional staff increases labor costs.
- **Staff Workload**: Increased demand on peak-hour staff may lead to burnout.
- **Quality of Care**: Rushing processes to reduce wait times could compromise patient safety or satisfaction.

### **4.2 Balancing Conflicting Objectives**

- **Use Simulation Models**: Test proposed changes in a simulated environment to predict impact on throughput, cost, and quality.
- **Staggered Implementation**: Roll out changes gradually and monitor KPIs to catch unintended consequences early.
- **Staff Involvement**: Engage frontline staff in redesign to ensure realistic and sustainable changes.
- **Patient Feedback Loop**: Use post-visit surveys to ensure that reductions in wait times do not come at the expense of perceived care quality.

## 5. Measuring Success

### **5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

To evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization strategies:

| KPI | Description | Target Improvement |
|-----|-------------|--------------------|
| Average Waiting Time (per queue) | Avg. time between activity completion and next activity start | Reduce by 25–40% |
| 90th Percentile Waiting Time | Worst 10% of patient experiences | Reduce by 30% |
| Total Visit Duration | From registration to check-out | Reduce by 15–20% |
| On-Time Start Rate | % of appointments starting on time | Increase by 20% |
| Resource Utilization (e.g., nurse, doctor) | % of time staff are busy | Optimize to 80–85% |
| Patient Satisfaction Score | Based on post-visit survey | Improve by 15% |
| Staff Overtime | Hours worked beyond scheduled | Keep stable or reduce |

### **5.2 Ongoing Monitoring and Sustained Improvement**

- **Automated Process Mining Dashboards**: Use tools like Celonis, Disco, or ProM to continuously analyze new event logs and track KPIs.
- **Monthly Queue Reports**: Visualize top queues, trends, and outlier cases.
- **Feedback Loop**: Integrate patient and staff feedback into process models to refine workflows.
- **Periodic Bottleneck Reassessment**: Every 3–6 months, re-run bottleneck analysis to catch new issues or shifts in process flow.
