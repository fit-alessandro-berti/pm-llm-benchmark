The picture is a **BPMNstyle swimlane process diagram** for handling a customer order.  
It is divided horizontally into four lanes: **Sales**, **Production**, **Procurement**, and **Warehouse**, and uses tasks, gateways, and message flows (dashed lines) to show how the departments interact.

**Sales lane (top):**
- The process starts with a **timer event (“Monday morning”)**.
- Inside a subprocess titled **“Check customer’s order”**, Sales:
  - checks the order for completeness,
  - checks whether the customer exists in the **database**,
  - adds the customer if needed (with a data store symbol).
- After this check, Sales **sends order details** to other departments (message flows).
- Sales then waits for a **“Product sent”** message from Warehouse and finally **drafts the invoice** before ending.

**Production lane:**
- Begins when **order details arrive** (message start event).
- A **parallel gateway** allows:
  - **planning production**, and
  - waiting for confirmation that materials are not faulty (message from Procurement).
- Once both are complete, **manufacture product** occurs.
- When finished, a **“Product complete”** message is sent to Warehouse.

**Procurement lane:**
- Starts with **order details arriving**.
- Runs a **Material Compensation Subprocess** (ordering materials and returning them if needed).
- Then **checks materials**.
- If materials are OK, sends **“Material not faulty”** to Production.
- If faulty, triggers **order cancellation** and ends.

**Warehouse lane (bottom):**
- Begins when **product complete** arrives from Production.
- **Sends product** to customer.
- Sends **“Product sent”** message back to Sales, ending the process.

Overall, the visualization shows the endtoend order fulfillment workflow, with decision points, parallel work, compensation/return logic, and interdepartment messaging.
