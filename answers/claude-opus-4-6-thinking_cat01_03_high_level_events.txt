# High-Level Process Step Abstraction

## Overview

After analyzing the event sequences across cases A1 and B2 (which follow an identical pattern), I identified **five** coherent high-level process stages. The grouping logic relies on a combination of:

- **Temporal proximity** (tight clusters of timestamps with gaps between phases)
- **Functional/logical coherence** (events that serve a shared purpose)
- **Resource affinity** (events performed by the same or same-type resource)
- **Process phase boundaries** (natural transition points in a manufacturing workflow)

## Proposed High-Level Activities

### 1. Material Preparation

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Included Low-Level Events** | `Retrieve raw metal sheet`  `Scan barcode`  `Place metal sheet on table`  `Align metal sheet`  `Preheat metal sheet` |
| **Timestamps (Case A1)** | 08:00:05 – 08:00:20 (15-second window) |
| **Resources Involved** | Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1 |

**Rationale:**
These five events collectively represent everything needed to get the raw material *ready* for the core manufacturing operation. No permanent transformation of the product occurs yet. The logic follows a clear intake sequence:

- **Retrieval & identification** (retrieve, scan barcode): The raw material enters the workflow and is logged/tracked.
- **Positioning** (place on table, align): The material is physically staged in the correct location and orientation for downstream work.
- **Conditioning** (preheat): The material is brought to the required thermal state for welding.

All five events are temporally tightly clustered (within ~15 seconds), and there is a **notable 40-second gap** between the last preparation event (08:00:20) and the first assembly event (08:01:00), signaling a clear phase transition. Even though three different resource types are involved, they all serve the singular goal of preparing the workpiece.

### 2. Welding Assembly

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Included Low-Level Events** | `Pick up welding tool`  `Weld corner A`  `Weld corner B` |
| **Timestamps (Case A1)** | 08:01:00 – 08:01:10 (10-second window) |
| **Resources Involved** | Operator B |

**Rationale:**
These three events represent the **core value-adding transformation** of the manufacturing process — the actual assembly via welding. Grouping logic:

- **Tool pickup is inseparable from welding:** Picking up the welding tool is not an independent activity; it is the direct setup action for the welding operations that immediately follow. It would be meaningless to analyze it in isolation.
- **Single resource:** All three events are executed by Operator B, indicating a single responsibility boundary.
- **Tight temporal cluster:** All events occur within 10 seconds.
- **Shared purpose:** The goal is to structurally join parts of the metal sheet.

The phase is bounded on both sides by transitions — a gap before it (from preparation) and a shift to a different resource type (Quality Sensor) after it.

### 3. Post-Weld Quality Inspection

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Included Low-Level Events** | `Measure weld integrity` |
| **Timestamps (Case A1)** | 08:01:20 |
| **Resources Involved** | Quality Sensor #1 |

**Rationale:**
This is a dedicated **inline quality gate** that evaluates the output of the preceding assembly step before the process continues. It is kept as its own high-level step rather than merged with assembly or final inspection for the following reasons:

- **Distinct purpose:** It specifically validates weld integrity (structural soundness), not general product quality or aesthetics.
- **Distinct resource type:** It is performed by an automated sensor (Quality Sensor #1), not by the assembly operator or a human inspector — indicating an organizationally separate function.
- **Process gate function:** In manufacturing, inline inspections serve as go/no-go checkpoints. If the `IntegrityScore` were below threshold, the process would likely diverge (rework or scrap). This decision point merits its own visibility in a process model.
- **Temporal separation:** It occurs 10 seconds after the last weld and 10 seconds before the coating step — it sits in its own time window.

### 4. Protective Coating Application

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Included Low-Level Events** | `Apply protective coating`  `Dry coating` |
| **Timestamps (Case A1)** | 08:01:30 – 08:01:45 (15-second window) |
| **Resources Involved** | Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2 |

**Rationale:**
These two events form a self-contained **surface finishing sub-process**. They are grouped because:

- **Logical dependency:** Drying is not an independent step — it is the mandatory curing/completion of the coating application. You cannot have one without the other; they are a single two-phase operation.
- **Shared functional goal:** Both events serve the purpose of applying and setting a protective surface layer (polyurethane) to the finished weld assembly.
- **Distinct from assembly and inspection:** Neither event involves structural joining (assembly) or measurement (inspection). They represent a separate manufacturing discipline — surface treatment/finishing.
- **Equipment-driven phase:** Both are performed by automated units (not human operators), and the shift from Coating Unit to Heating Unit represents a handoff within the same functional domain.

### 5. Final Visual Inspection

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Included Low-Level Events** | `Visual check` |
| **Timestamps (Case A1)** | 08:02:00 |
| **Resources Involved** | Operator C |

**Rationale:**
This is the **end-of-line quality gate** — a holistic human inspection of the finished product. It is separated from the post-weld inspection (Step 3) because:

- **Different scope:** The post-weld inspection measured a specific quantitative metric (weld integrity score). This visual check assesses the *overall finished product*, including the coating, appearance, and any visible defects.
- **Different resource:** Performed by Operator C — a dedicated inspector who has not been involved in any prior step, ensuring independence and objectivity (separation of duties).
- **Different position in the process:** This occurs *after* all manufacturing operations are complete. It is the final gate before the product exits the process.
- **Pass/fail outcome:** The `Check: Passed` result suggests a binary release decision, characteristic of a final inspection gate.

```

## Summary of Grouping Criteria Applied

| Criterion | How It Was Used |
|---|---|
| **Temporal clustering** | Events within tight time windows (5–15 sec) grouped together; gaps of 30–40 sec treated as phase boundaries |
| **Resource affinity** | Events by the same operator (e.g., Operator A for intake, Operator B for welding) naturally clustered |
| **Functional coherence** | Events serving the same manufacturing purpose grouped (e.g., coating + drying = surface finishing) |
| **Process logic / domain knowledge** | Manufacturing workflows follow a standard pattern: prepare  transform  inspect  finish  final check |
| **Dependency chains** | Inseparable event pairs (pick up tool  weld; apply coating  dry coating) kept together |

This abstraction reduces a 12-event trace to a **5-step process model**, making it far easier to analyze cycle times per phase, identify bottlenecks, compare cases, and detect process deviations at a meaningful level of granularity.
