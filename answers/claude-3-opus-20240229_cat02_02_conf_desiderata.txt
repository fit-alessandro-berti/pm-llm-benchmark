Based on the given normative rules, desiderata, and the event log, here is my analysis:

1. Cases violating normative rules:

Case 2 violates two normative rules:
a) Risk Assessment is performed before Credit Check, which is not allowed according to the strict sequence.
b) Finalize Documentation activity occurs after the loan has been rejected. The rules state that if the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation.

2. Cases not meeting desiderata conditions:

Case 3 fails to meet two desiderata conditions, although these are not severe violations:
a) The Credit Check is performed more than 24 hours after the Application Received event, which is longer than the recommended time window.
b) The applicant is informed of the decision after more than 48 hours (around 75 hours later), exceeding the suggested prompt notification.
Additionally, Case 3 does not include a Follow-up Call before closing the case. While not a strict requirement, it is an encouraged best practice.

It's important to note that the desiderata conditions in Case 3, while not ideal, do not represent serious violations of the process. They are suboptimal behaviors that should be improved but do not invalidate the process execution.

3. Possible interpretations or justifications:

Case 2: It's possible that the Credit Check was initially overlooked and then performed out of order to rectify the mistake. However, this doesn't justify Finalize Documentation after the rejection decision.

Case 3: The delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant could be attributed to a high workload or resource constraints. The absence of a Follow-up Call might indicate that it was deemed unnecessary in this specific case, or simply forgotten.

In general, Case 1 demonstrates a proper execution of the loan application process, adhering to all normative rules and desiderata. Cases 2 and 3 showcase deviations that should be addressed to ensure consistent compliance with the defined process standards.
