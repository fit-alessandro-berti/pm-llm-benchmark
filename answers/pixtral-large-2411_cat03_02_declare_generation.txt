Certainly! Below is an example of a DECLARE model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. The P2P process typically involves activities such as `Create Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods`, `Approve Invoice`, `Pay Invoice`, and `Reject Invoice`.

Here's how you might define the DECLARE model in pm4py:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Approve Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Pay Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'absence': {
        'Reject Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        'Pay Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Approve Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Approve Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'coexistence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},

        ('Pay Invoice', 'Reject Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Existence**: `Create Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods`, `Approve Invoice`, and `Pay Invoice` must occur at least once.
- **Absence**: `Reject Invoice` should not occur.
- **Exactly One**: `Pay Invoice` should occur exactly once.
- **Initialization**: The process starts with `Create Purchase Order`.
- **Responded Existence**: If `Create Purchase Order` occurs, then `Receive Goods` must occur. If `Receive Goods` occurs, then `Approve Invoice` must occur. If `Approve Invoice` occurs, then `Pay Invoice` must occur.
- **Co-Existence**: Similar to responded existence but ensures that both activities occur in the trace.
- **Response**: Ensures that if `Create Purchase Order` occurs, then `Receive Goods` must occur in the future. Similar for other pairs.
- **Precedence**: Ensures that if `Receive Goods` occurs, then `Create Purchase Order` must have occurred before. Similar for other pairs.
- **Succession**: Combines response and precedence constraints.
- **Alternate Response, Alternate Precedence, Alternate Succession**: Ensures that the activities must alternate without repetitions.
- **Chain Response, Chain Precedence, Chain Succession**: Ensures the directly-follows relation between activities.
- **Non Co-Existence**: Ensures that if `Create Purchase Order` occurs, then `Reject Invoice` should not occur. Similar for other pairs.
- **Non Succession and Non Chain Succession**: Ensures that `Reject Invoice` should not follow any of the other activities.

This model captures the typical flow and constraints of a Purchase-to-Pay process.
