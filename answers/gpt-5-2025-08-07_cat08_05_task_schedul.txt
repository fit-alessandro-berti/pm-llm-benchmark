Below is a cohesive plan that turns your MES event data into actionable scheduling intelligence and a set of advanced strategies for markedly better performance. It ties process mining, scheduling science, and simulation into one continuous-improvement loop tailored to high-mix/low-volume, sequence-dependent setups, and frequent disruptions.

1) Analyze historical scheduling performance and dynamics

A. Reconstruct the actual process and resource behavior
- Data model:
  - Case = Job ID; Activity = operational steps (Queue Entry, Setup Start/End, Task Start/End, Inspection, Rework, Hold, etc.).
  - Resources = machines and operators; add attributes (material, tooling, part family, thickness, program ID).
  - Link events to routing positions (Op1 Cutting  Op2 Milling  …) using timestamps and known routings.
- Process discovery:
  - Use Inductive Miner to discover the control-flow and routing variants (robust to noise in job shops). Heuristics Miner for frequency-based views of common paths.
  - Build resource-centric timelines: per-machine event sequences; per-operator sequences.
- Performance enhancement:
  - Annotate the discovered model and resource timelines with durations from the log: waiting, setup, processing, blocked/starved, rework.

B. Core metrics and how to compute them from the log
- Job-level
  - Flow time per job: completion time (last Task End or Inspection End) minus release time (Job Released).
  - Lead time distribution: flow time; report mean, median, 75th/90th/95th percentiles.
  - Makespan per day/week: span from first start to last finish per planning bucket.
- Station/machine-level
  - Queue/waiting time: Queue Entry to Setup Start (or Task Start if no setup).
  - Setup time: Setup Start to Setup End (sequence-dependent).
  - Run time: Task Start to Task End.
  - Idle time: gap between prior Task/Setup End and next Setup/Task Start when queue is empty (starvation) vs when queue exists (idle due to policy/priority).
  - Utilization: run time / available time; add setup ratio = setup time / available time; effective utilization = (run + setup)/available.
- Sequence-dependent setup analysis
  - Build a setup matrix per machine: expected setup time for transition (previous job’s family/features  next job’s family/features). Estimate by grouping on key drivers (e.g., material, thickness range, fixture/tooling family, tolerance class), not only job ID. Compute mean, median, and 80th/95th percentile per pair.
  - Augment with predictive model: regress setup time using features of both jobs (prev and next), machine, operator, time-of-day; include interaction terms. This yields E[setup | sequence] used later for scheduling.
- Schedule adherence and due-date performance
  - Lateness L = completion  due date; Tardiness T = max(0, L); Weighted tardiness T_w = priority weight × T.
  - OTIF (on-time-in-full) %; earliness %; average and 90th percentile tardiness; proportion of hot jobs meeting due dates.
  - If planned schedule timestamps exist, use alignment-based conformance checking to quantify deviations; if not, compare to planned durations to compute plan error by operation.
- Disruptions impact
  - Mark breakdown intervals and priority-change events on machine timelines; tag all affected jobs.
  - Compute delta KPIs for affected vs matched control jobs (propensity score matching by priority, routing, release date).
  - Estimate lost capacity: integral of blocked/starved during breakdown windows; quantify tardiness uplift attributable to breakdowns.
  - Survival analysis: hazard of becoming tardy as a function of queue length, breakdown proximity, and priority changes.

C. Visual analytics
- Dotted chart: job progress over time; visualize rework loops and stalls.
- Bottleneck analysis: shifting bottleneck detection via the longest active queue and highest effective utilization over rolling windows.
- Variant analysis: compare routes, resources, and setup footprints for on-time vs late jobs.

2) Diagnose scheduling pathologies with evidence

Likely issues and how to verify with the log:

- Chronic and shifting bottlenecks
  - Evidence: near-saturated effective utilization (run+setup)/available > 85–90% for MILL-03, HEAT-01, GRIND-02; long queues; high waiting/flow-time percentiles; large share of job lateness attributable to waiting on these resources.
- Poor prioritization
  - Evidence: hot or near-due jobs waiting behind lower-impact work; compute priority inversions (instances where a job with higher priority and lower slack waited while a lower-priority job ran). Quantify excess tardiness from inversions.
- Setup-inefficient sequencing
  - Evidence: frequent long setup transitions (from setup matrix) chosen over short ones; sum of realized setup time vs minimal achievable if local sequence had followed shortest-changeover-first. Report gap as % avoidable setup.
- Starvation and blocking
  - Evidence: downstream machines idle while upstream queues/bottlenecks grow; cross-correlation of upstream queue spikes leading to downstream starvation windows.
- WIP bullwhip
  - Evidence: high variability in queue lengths across stations; large swings after disruptions or hot-job inserts; increased flow-time variance with WIP peaks.
- Rework/quality loops amplifying lead times
  - Evidence: variant analysis showing late jobs more likely to traverse rework; quantify rework frequency and added time.

Process mining tools to support evidence:
- Bottleneck miner and throughput analysis on resource timelines.
- Variant comparator (on-time vs late) including resource assignment differences and setup footprints.
- Organizational/resource miner to detect contention between operators and machines (e.g., scarce operator OP-105 gating multiple machines).
- Conformance checking to detect policy violations (e.g., EDD rule overridden) if a policy log exists.

3) Root cause analysis of scheduling ineffectiveness

- Static local rules in a turbulent environment
  - FCFS/EDD ignore downstream load, sequence-dependent setups, and real-time breakdowns; myopic decisions at one center harm the system.
- Lack of real-time visibility/coordination
  - No shop-wide optimization; bottleneck queues balloon while non-bottlenecks idle.
- Inaccurate duration and setup estimates
  - Planned vs actual error distributions show bias and high variance by machine/operator/material; schedules made on averages fail under high variability.
- Sequence-dependent setups not modeled
  - High-frequency long-changeover transitions chosen; no explicit penalty in priority calculation.
- No structured response to disruptions
  - Breakdowns and hot jobs cause frequent rescheduling shocks; without lookahead, schedules whipsaw queues.
- Capacity vs scheduling logic: how to distinguish
  - If effective utilization on key machines is <80% yet tardiness is high, causes are scheduling/coordination/policy.
  - If effective utilization is >90% with high variability, capacity is constraining; even optimal scheduling yields long queues. Process mining plus queueing analysis (Kingman’s formula proxies) can quantify the minimum achievable flow times at current variability and load.
  - Simulation calibrated from logs can separate what’s structural (capacity/variability) from what’s policy-driven.

4) Advanced data-driven scheduling strategies

Strategy 1: Dynamic composite dispatching (ATCS-plus) with WIP control and bottleneck awareness
- Core logic
  - At each machine decision point, compute a dynamic priority index for each waiting job that blends: due-date urgency, remaining processing including downstream, predicted processing time, predicted sequence-dependent setup time if this job follows the current one, job priority, and downstream congestion risk.
  - Example index (higher is better):
    - Score = w1 × exp(Slack/kt) × w_priority × exp(E[Setup_next]/ks) × exp(DownstreamLoad/kd) × 1/(E[Proc]^)
    - Slack = due date  now  E[remaining process time to go]; DownstreamLoad = predicted queue time at next bottleneck station; E[Setup_next] from the learned setup matrix/model; parameters kt, ks, kd,  tuned via simulation-based optimization.
  - Add WIP control: cap release into the system or into bottleneck loops (CONWIP/POLCA-like). Hold jobs upstream if WIP limits reached to prevent queue explosions.
  - Bottleneck first: for the identified bottlenecks, run the same index but give higher ks weight so the policy heavily discourages long changeovers unless due-date risk outweighs it.
- Data inputs from process mining
  - E[setup | sequence], E[proc | machine, operator, job features], remaining-route time distributions, real-time queue lengths, current and predicted machine states.
- Pathologies addressed
  - Reduces priority inversions; balances tardiness risk against setup penalties; aligns choices system-wide via downstream load term; prevents WIP bullwhip via caps.
- Expected impact
  - 20–40% reduction in average tardiness; 25–35% reduction in 90th-percentile flow time; 15–30% reduction in total setup time at bottlenecks; lower WIP variance.

Strategy 2: Predictive, risk-aware finite-capacity scheduling with rolling horizon and disruption-aware re-optimization
- Core logic
  - Train predictive models from the log:
    - Processing time model per operation: gradient boosting regression using machine, operator, material, thickness, part complexity, time-of-day, program ID.
    - Setup time model: features of current-next pair; plus operator and time-of-day.
    - Breakdown risk: survival model for time-to-failure and time-to-repair per machine; derive short-term failure probability over the next horizon.
  - Rolling-horizon schedule:
    - Every 30–60 minutes (or event-triggered), generate a finite-capacity schedule over H hours (e.g., 8–16 hours) using predicted durations and setup times; include breakdown risk by:
      - Avoiding placing long, tight-deadline jobs just before high-risk windows; or
      - Reserving contingency buffers; or
      - Proactively scheduling maintenance if risk > threshold and workload allows.
    - Solve via metaheuristics (e.g., iterated local search or genetic algorithm) or MILP for bottleneck machines; objective: minimize total weighted tardiness +  × expected setup time +  × risk of disruption.
  - Risk projections:
    - Monte Carlo sample durations and breakdowns to compute each job’s tardiness risk distribution; flag at-risk jobs for proactive expediting or resequencing before the risk materializes.
- Data inputs from process mining
  - Empirical and modeled duration distributions; breakdown/repair distributions; route variants; operator performance effects.
- Pathologies addressed
  - Anticipates bottlenecks; cushions breakdowns; prevents late discovery of lateness; improves due-date reliability.
- Expected impact
  - 30–50% reduction in weighted tardiness; improved due-date promise accuracy (P80 lead time error cut by 30–40%); less schedule volatility through informed reschedules.

Strategy 3: Setup-time optimization via intelligent family batching and sequence planning at bottlenecks
- Core logic
  - Build campaign schedules on bottleneck machines:
    - Cluster jobs into setup families (from mining: minimize expected intra-family setup times).
    - Two-level decision:
      1) Batch formation within lookahead window W (e.g., next 6–12 hours of arrivals) with constraints on max wait per job and due-date slack.
      2) Family sequence selection to minimize sum of sequence-dependent setups + weighted tardiness (single-machine SDST problem). Use nearest-neighbor with lookahead or metaheuristic with due-date penalties.
  - Pre-stage tooling/fixtures (SMED): using the predicted next family, externalize as much setup as possible while current job runs; orchestrate operator allocation accordingly.
  - Controlled release to batch: if a job’s due date allows, delay release into the bottleneck queue until its family campaign window to reduce changeovers; override if due-date risk crosses threshold.
- Data inputs from process mining
  - The setup transition matrix and predicted setup model; due-date slack distributions; historical family-level queue dynamics; operator-tool availability.
- Pathologies addressed
  - Slashes avoidable changeovers; stabilizes bottleneck flow; reduces starvation elsewhere by smoothing campaign starts/ends.
- Expected impact
  - 25–50% reduction in setup time at the targeted machines; 10–20% throughput gain at the bottleneck; 15–25% lower WIP around those centers; reduced lead-time variability.

Implementation notes for all strategies
- Begin with bottleneck machines; expand to others.
- Parameters (weights, horizons, WIP caps) tuned by simulation against your demand and disruption profile.
- All strategies operate in a rolling, event-driven manner integrated with MES; decisions reevaluated upon significant events (job release, job completion, breakdown start/end, hot-job arrival).

5) Simulation, evaluation, and continuous improvement

A. Discrete-event simulation to de-risk and tune
- Model scope
  - Entities: jobs with full routings and due dates; resources (machines with calendars, operators), sequence-dependent setups, tool/fixture constraints, queue priorities.
  - Stochastic elements from mining:
    - Processing and setup time distributions (per feature segment); breakdown and repair distributions per machine; arrival process of jobs and hot jobs; rework probabilities and loops; priority changes.
  - Policies to compare: baseline (current dispatching), Strategy 1, Strategy 2, Strategy 3, and hybrid variants (e.g., Strategy 1 + partial batching).
- Experiments
  - Load scenarios: nominal, high load (bottleneck at 90–95% effective utilization), and surge weeks.
  - Disruption scenarios: elevated breakdown frequency; clustered hot jobs; operator shortages; setup-heavy mixes.
  - Sensitivity: due-date tightness; variability inflation (e.g., +20% variance).
- KPIs and statistical rigor
  - Mean/median/90th/95th of flow time and tardiness; percent tardy; weighted tardiness; WIP and queue distributions; setup share of time; throughput; OTIF; schedule stability (reschedules per day).
  - Warm-up removal, multiple replications, confidence intervals; paired comparisons; choose champion strategy by robust dominance, not single-point means.
- Output
  - Tuned parameter sets (e.g., ks, kd, WIP caps, horizon H).
  - What-if playbook: which policy to activate under which shop conditions.

B. Continuous monitoring and adaptive control via ongoing process mining
- Real-time data pipeline
  - Stream events from MES; maintain live machine and queue states; recompute job slacks, predicted durations, and E[setup_next].
- KPI dashboards with alerting
  - Rolling OTIF, tardiness distribution, bottleneck effective utilization, queue thresholds, setup time share at bottlenecks, hot-job on-time %, prediction error of duration models.
- Drift detection and auto-tuning
  - Monitor prediction residuals; trigger model retraining when error drifts (CUSUM/ADWIN).
  - Periodic re-mining of setup matrices and family clusters as product mix changes.
  - Auto-tune strategy weights via Bayesian optimization on a fast surrogate simulator or off-peak DES runs; apply guarded updates.
- Decision governance
  - Daily production control meeting: review predicted late jobs, bottleneck campaigns, maintenance windows.
  - Weekly: parameter review; top loss analysis (setup transitions causing most loss); operator cross-training opportunities from resource miner.
  - Monthly: revalidate due-date quoting rules using updated flow-time percentiles and demand profile.

What you will get, concretely
- A mined, validated digital twin: routings, time models, breakdown risks, setup matrices.
- Evidence-backed diagnosis of bottlenecks, priority failures, setup waste, and WIP dynamics.
- Three deployable, data-driven scheduling policies integrated with MES:
  1) Dynamic composite dispatching with WIP control and bottleneck awareness.
  2) Predictive, risk-aware rolling finite-capacity scheduling with proactive disruption handling.
  3) Setup-optimized batching and sequencing at bottlenecks with SMED pre-staging.
- A simulation-verified operating envelope and a monitoring/tuning loop to sustain gains.

Expected outcome after phased deployment on bottlenecks then shop-wide
- 20–50% reduction in weighted tardiness; 20–40% lower WIP; 15–30% shorter 90th-percentile lead time; 10–20% throughput increase at critical machines; significantly improved due-date reliability and schedule stability.
