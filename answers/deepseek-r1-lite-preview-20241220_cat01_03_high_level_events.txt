To group the low-level events into meaningful high-level process steps, we analyze the sequence of activities, the resources involved, and the logical flow of the manufacturing process. Here's the structured representation of the proposed high-level activities:

---

### 1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Activities:**
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet
     - Scan barcode
     - Place metal sheet on table
     - Align metal sheet
     - Preheat metal sheet
   - **Rationale:** These actions are preparatory steps to ready the raw material for further processing. They ensure the correct material is selected, positioned, and prepared for assembly.

### 2. **Assembly**
   - **Activities:**
     - Pick up welding tool
     - Weld corner A
     - Weld corner B
     - Measure weld integrity
   - **Rationale:** This step involves the core assembly operations, where components are joined together, followed by an immediate quality check to ensure the assembly is correct.

### 3. **Finishing**
   - **Activities:**
     - Apply protective coating
     - Dry coating
   - **Rationale:** Post-assembly steps to protect the product and prepare it for final inspection. These activities enhance the product's durability and appearance.

### 4. **Final Inspection**
   - **Activities:**
     - Visual check
   - **Rationale:** The final step to ensure the entire product meets the required quality standards before it is deemed complete.

---

### **Rationale for Groupings:**

- **Material Preparation** captures the initial steps needed to prepare the material for manufacturing.
- **Assembly** includes the physical construction of the product, followed by a quality check to validate the assembly.
- **Finishing** involves protective and final treatment steps after assembly is complete.
- **Final Inspection** ensures the product is fully compliant with quality requirements.
