## 1. Cases with Significant Delays

By computing the elapsed time from **Submit Claim** to **Close Claim** for each case, we find:

| Case ID | Start                      | End                        | Duration                | Classification      |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00           | 2024-04-01 10:30           | 1 h 30 m                | Fast                |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05           | 2024-04-02 11:00           | 25 h 55 m (~1 day)      | Moderate            |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10           | 2024-04-03 09:30           | 48 h 20 m (~2 days)     | Delayed             |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20           | 2024-04-01 10:45           | 1 h 25 m                | Fast                |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25           | 2024-04-04 14:30           | 77 h 05 m (~3 days + 5 h)| Severely Delayed    |

**Key observations:**
- **Normal**: Lowcomplexity cases (2001, 2004) close within ~1½ hours.
- **Moderate**: One mediumcomplexity case (2002) spans ~26 hours.
- **Problematic**: Both highcomplexity cases (2003, 2005) exceed two days.

## 2. Correlation of Attributes with Delays

1. **Complexity**  
   - Low-complexity claims close rapidly (~1–1.5 h).  
   - Medium-complexity (2002) requires a single “Request Additional Documents” step, extending to ~26 h.  
   - High-complexity (2003, 2005) involve **multiple** documentrequest cycles (2 for 2003, 3 for 2005), pushing total throughput past 48 h and 72 h respectively.  

2. **Region**  
   - Region A (Cases 2001, 2003): low complexity is fast; high complexity takes ~48 h.  
   - Region B (Cases 2002, 2004, 2005): low complexity is fast; medium complexity ~26 h; high complexity ~77 h.  
   - **Insight**: Region B’s highcomplexity case (2005) is slower than Region A’s (2003) primarily due to **one extra** documentrequest iteration. Region alone isn’t the root cause but can amplify delays if combined with repetitive handoffs.

3. **Resource Roles**  
   - **Adjusters** (Mike vs Lisa): both request additional documents for non-low complexity, but Lisa’s highcomplexity case (three requests) incurs more roundtrips than Mike’s (two requests).  
   - **Managers** (Ann vs Bill): for low/medium complexity, Ann approves within 30 minutes (low) to 20 hours (medium); Bill approves high complexity in 19–23 hours. Manager workload and SLAs likely affect approval turnaround.  
   - **Finance** (Alan vs Carl): payment follows approval after 15 minutes (Alan, low), 45 minutes (Carl, medium), but several hours for high complexity—again reflecting waiting on document completeness and managerial sign-off.

## 3. Root Causes & Mitigation Suggestions

### A. Root Causes
1. **Multiround Document Requests**  
   - Highcomplexity claims often lack all required evidence initially, triggering successive requests that incur overnight waits (especially when requests are issued late in the day).

2. **Handoff Delays & Working Hours**  
   - When a request is made after business hours (e.g., 17:00), the next step can only occur the following day, adding ~12–24 hours per handoff.

3. **Approval Bottlenecks for Complex Cases**  
   - Managers handling highcomplexity caseloads appear to average ~20 hours to approve once all docs are in — a window that compounds after document loops.

### B. Recommendations
1. **Enhanced Prescreening at Submission**  
   - Implement an **automated checklist** or customer-facing form that validates required documents before “Submit Claim.”  
   - Provide applicants with dynamic guidance (e.g., “If your claim is >\$10 K, also upload invoices X, Y, Z”).

2. **Tiered Claim Routing**  
   - **Segment** claims by complexity at intake and route high-complexity straight to a **specialist team** trained to gather all needed information in one interaction.

3. **SLAdriven Escalation & Notifications**  
   - Set strict internal SLAs (e.g., documentrequest responses within 4 h during business hours).  
   - Send automated reminders to both claimants and adjusters if a hand-off exceeds a threshold (e.g., 6 h), ensuring faster follow-through.

4. **Extended or Flexible Working Windows**  
   - For adjusters and managers, allow a brief **evening shift** (e.g., until 19:00) or a rotating “on-call” schedule so lateday requests aren’t left hanging until next morning.

5. **Process Automation for Routine Checks**  
   - Use RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to validate simple document criteria (e.g., file type, size, date), freeing adjusters to focus on substantive reviews.

By focusing on **reducing back-and-forth document loops**, **tightening approval SLAs**, and **front-loading complexity management**, the insurer can cut multi-day high-complexity cycle times down to under 48 hours and bring medium-complexity workflows closer to the one-day mark.
