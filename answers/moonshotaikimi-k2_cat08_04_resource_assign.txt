# Process Mining-Based Resource Assignment Optimization Plan for TechSolve Solutions

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1 Agent and Tier Performance Metrics

Using the event log data, I would extract the following key performance indicators for both individual agents and support tiers:

**Agent-Level Metrics:**
- **Workload Distribution**: 
  - Tickets handled per agent per week/month
  - Average active ticket count per agent
  - Utilization rate (time spent on tickets vs. available time)
  
- **Processing Efficiency**:
  - Average handling time by ticket priority (P1/P2/P3/P4)
  - First-call resolution rate (for L1 agents specifically)
  - Average time to first assignment per agent
  
- **Skill Utilization**:
  - Percentage of tickets requiring agent's specialized skills
  - Over/under-utilization index: (tickets requiring agent's skills)/(total tickets handled)
  - Percentage of tickets escalated after assignment to agent

**Tier-Level Metrics:**
- **Resolution Rates by Tier**:
  - L1 completion rate by category/priority
  - Escalation rates from L1 to L2, L2 to L3
  
- **Queue Performance**:
  - Average queue time per tier by priority
  - Queue length distribution by tier

### 1.2 Process Mining for Actual Assignment Patterns

**End-to-End Process Discovery:**
Apply process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner) to extract the complete incident lifecycle:
- Focus on resource assignment activities (Assign L1, Assign L2, Escalate, Reassign)
- Identify typical patterns vs. exceptions

**Resource Handover Analysis:**
- Extract resource-resource handovers using directly follows relations
- Build a handover matrix showing frequency of transitions between agents/tiers
- Visualize as a Social Network showing communication patterns

**Skill-Based Routing Discovery:**
- Correlate required skills column with assigned agent skills
- Create decision rules for assignment decisions by analyzing:
  - What skill combinations lead to which agent assignments
  - Success rates of different assignment patterns

### 1.3 Skill Utilization Visibility

**Skill Heat Map Creation:**
- Develop a matrix showing:
  - Required skills per ticket (from Required Skill column)
  - Available skills per agent (from Agent Skills column)
  - Actual utilization rates for each skill

**Skill Efficiency Analysis:**
- For each skill type, calculate:
  - Average resolution time when assigned to matching-skilled agent
  - For specialists: percentage of tickets handled that DIDN'T require their expertise
  - Gap analysis between available skills and required skills

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### 2.1 Bottleneck Detection Strategies

**Performance Spectrum Analysis for Queues:**
- Visualize queue lengths over time for each tier
- Identify peak periods where queues build up
- Correlate queue spikes with:
  - Ticket priority (highlighting SLA risk periods)
  - Required skill availability

**Reassignment Impact Quantification:**
Create metrics to measure reassignment overhead:
- **Reassignment Frequency Index**:
  - Percentage of tickets reassigned after initial assignment
  - Average reassignments per ticket
  
- **Reassignment Delay Calculation**:
  - For tickets with >1 reassignment: Average time between "Assign*" and "Reassign" events
  - Contribution to total resolution time: (reassignment_delay)/(total_time)
  - SLA breach correlation: Breach probability vs. reassignment count

### 2.2 Skill-Bottleneck Analysis

**Skill Demand vs. Supply Matching:**
- Create a daily/weekly series showing:
  - Incoming tickets requiring each skill
  - Available agent-hours for each skill
  - Identify skill shortfalls (supply < demand)

**Critical Path Analysis:**
For tickets exceeding SLAs:
- Trace their complete path through agents
- Identify which resource assignments/availability caused delays
- Build a "delay cause" classification:
  - Skill-unavailable delay
  - Queue-waiting delay
  - Reassignment-processing delay

### 2.3 Impact Correlation with SLAs

Create a regression model to predict SLA breach probability based on:
- Initial assignment tier
- Required skill specificity
- Agent skill match percentage
- Reassignment count pre-resolution
- Queue position at assignment

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Decision Mining for Assignment Rules

**Trace Clustering by Assignment Outcome:**
Cluster tickets based on:
- Those with 1 assignment vs. those with >1 reassignment
- Each cluster: analyze characteristics (category, required skill, initial agent)

**Decision Tree Mining:**
Learn decision trees for:
- What leads to successful first assignment (no reassignment needed)?
- What characteristics predict eventual escalation?
- Required data features: ticket category, priority, required skill, initial agent tier, skill match ratio

### 3.2 Variant Analysis for Assignment Patterns

**Complete Case Fragment Analysis:**
Extract complete case variants focusing on resource assignments:
- Compare "ideal" flows (L1Resolved) with "problematic" flows (L1L2ReassignL3)
- For each variant:
  - Calculate impact on resolution time
  - Identify common factors (same category? same required skills? same initial agents?)

**Agent-Level Root Causes Investigation:**
For high-reassignment agents:
- Extract tickets they initially received
- Compare characteristics with successful-first-assignment agents:
  - Are they being assigned tickets above their skill level?
  - Are they appropriately escalating or creating reassignment chains?

### 3.3 Systematic Root Cause Categorization

After analysis, categorize root causes:
1. **Assignment Logic Issues**:
   - Skill-mismatch assignments
   - Workload-ignoring round-robin
2. **Information Issues**:
   - Incorrect required skill identification
   - Outdated agent skill profiles
3. **Process Issues**:
   - Unclear escalation criteria
   - Lack of real-time skill availability check
4. **Resource Issues**:
   - Specialist underutilization
   - L1 training gaps

## 4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### 4.1 Strategy 1: Intelligent Skill-Based Routing

**Issue Addressed**: Unnecessary reassignments due to initial skill mismatch

**How it works**:
- Pre-mine historical associations between ticket characteristics (category, keywords, priority) and actual skills required
- Create an "intelligent routing engine" that considers:
  - Ticket requirements  converts to required skills
  - Agent available skills and proficiency levels
  - Agent current workload (queue position + estimated remaining time)
  - Historical success rates for each agent-skill combination

**Implementation Data Requirements**:
- Agent skill database with proficiency scores (1-5 scale)
- Ticket categorization rules with skill requirements
- Real-time agent availability (from currently active tickets + calendar)
- Historical performance database per agent-skill combination

**Expected Benefits**:
- 40-50% reduction in reassignments
- 15-20% improvement in first-assignment resolution rate
- Corresponding SLA compliance improvement

### 4.2 Strategy 2: Dynamic Tier-Crossing Assignment

**Issue Addressed**: Specialists handling simple tickets and L1 agents escalating unnecessarily

**How it works**:
- Analyze success rates by substantially simplifying ticket details
- Implement "tier-jumping" algorithm for tickets with:
  - Very clear/standard required skill (e.g., DB-SQL for specific error type)
  - Historical pattern of direct L2/3 resolution
- Allow qualified L1 agents to "tag" tickets for direct escalations based on specific keywords/triggers

**Implementation Data Requirements**:
- Rule-based tagging system for direct escalation
- Performance tracking for tier-jumping cases
- Feedback loop: reinforcement learning to adjust rules based on outcomes

**Expected Benefits**:
- 25-30% reduction in unnecessary escalations
- 20% time savings for specialist skills
- More efficient resource utilization overall

### 4.3 Strategy 3: Predictive Workload Management

**Issue Addressed**: Uneven workload distribution and queue balancing

**How it works**:
- Use process mining to predict incoming ticket volumes by category/skill requirement
- Implement a "floating resource" system:
  - Identify agents with multi-skilled capabilities with >30% idle time
  - Proactively reassign/reserve these agents for expected peak skill demands
- Create real-time dashboard showing:
  - Projected demand by skill for next 2-4 hours
  - Queue length predictions
  - Recommendations for resource reallocation

**Implementation Data Requirements**:
- Historical ticket arrival patterns by hour/day/week
- Agent schedule flexibility data
- Skill proficiency matrix for multi-skilled agents
- Real-time queue management system

**Expected Benefits**:
- 30-35% improvement in SLA compliance during peak periods
- 15-20% reduction in average wait time
- Better agent satisfaction through distributed stress

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1 Business Process Simulation

**Pre-Implementation Validation via Digital Twin**:
- Model the complete incident management process in a simulation environment
- Parameter input:
  - Current ticket arrival patterns (from event log mining)
  - Agent availability and skills (from HR system)
  - Proposed assignment algorithms (Strategies 1-3)
- Run Monte Carlo simulations for:
  - 1-week period with current assignment logic
  - Same period with each proposed strategy
- Key simulation metrics:
  - SLA breach rates by priority
  - Average resolution time distribution
  - Agent utilization levels
  - Queue length predictions
  - Cost analysis (considering specialist hourly rates)

### 5.2 Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan

**Dashboard Creation - Real-Time Monitoring**:

**Resource Assignment KPIs**:
```
1. First-Assignment Success Rate: % tickets resolved by initial assigned agent
2. Reassignment Reduction: Current vs. baseline count
3. Skill Utilization Score: ((skill_match × proficiency) / total_tickets) × 100
4. Queue Efficiency: (average_queue_time_target) / (actual_average_queue_time)
5. SLA Breach Root Cause: Breakdown of breaches by category (skill mismatch, queue, etc.)
```

**Process View Monitoring**:
- **Cumulative Flow Diagrams**: Track tickets by status with controls for agent/resource pools
- **Circular Dependency Charts**: Visualize reassignment patterns (Agent A  Agent B  Agent A)
- **Resource Calendar Views**: Combined visualization of agent schedules, current tickets, predicted queue
- **Failure Mode Analysis**: Drill-down reporting for tickets with specific failure patterns

**Alerting System**:
- Predefined thresholds for all KPIs
- Severity-based escalation to operational managers
- Weekly ML-based anomaly detection on assignment patterns

**Continuous Improvement Loop**:
- Monthly re-mining of assignment logs
- Quarterly refinement of assignment algorithms
- Semi-annual strategy review based on business changes

### 5.3 Implementation Roadmap
