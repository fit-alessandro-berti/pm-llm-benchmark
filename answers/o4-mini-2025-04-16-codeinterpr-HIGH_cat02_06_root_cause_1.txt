Here’s a high-level summary of what the data reveals:

1. Total Cycle Times  
  • Case 101: 08:00–10:15 on Mar 1  2 h 15 min  
  • Case 103: 08:10–09:30 on Mar 1  1 h 20 min  
  • Case 102: 08:05 on Mar 1–09:15 on Mar 2  ~25 h 10 min  
  • Case 104: 08:20 on Mar 1–08:30 on Mar 2  ~24 h 10 min  
  • Case 105: 08:25 on Mar 1–09:30 on Mar 3  ~49 h 05 min  

“Quick” tickets (101, 103) close in under 2½ hours. The other three (102, 104, 105) take roughly one to two days.

2. Root-Cause Patterns  
  a) Escalations to Level-2  
    – Cases 102 and 105 both escalate to Level-2. After the “Escalate” event they sit in queue:  
      • 102 waits from 11:30 to 14:00 before L-2 starts investigating, then overnight until 09:00 next day to resolve.  
      • 105 waits ~28 h (10:00 Mar 1  14:00 Mar 2) before L-2 picks it up, then overnight again.  
    – Each escalation adds a hand-off plus long “no-work” windows.  
  b) Overnight/Shift Boundaries  
    – Case 104 never formally “escalates,” but after L-1 investigation at 13:00 on Mar 1 it isn’t resolved until 08:00 next morning—likely waiting for next-day shift or another team.  
  c) Dependency Delays  
    – Whether it’s a specialized L-2 queue or an engineering/deployment team, any cross-team dependency introduces multi-hour or overnight waits.  

3. How These Factors Inflate Cycle Time  
  – Every escalation duplicates the routing/triage overhead and then sits unaddressed until the specialist team picks it up.  
  – Overnight shift hand-offs effectively “freeze” tickets until the next business period.  
  – Lack of explicit SLAs or alerts on “time since escalation” means no one intervenes when a ticket has sat 10+ hours.  

4. Recommendations to Reduce Bottlenecks  
  • Define and monitor SLAs for Escalation Response: e.g. “specialist must begin investigation within 2 hours of escalation,” with automated alerts if breached.  
  • Introduce extended-hours or follow-the-sun coverage for critical escalations so they don’t sit overnight.  
  • Empower Level-1 agents with additional troubleshooting scripts or “swivel-chair” tools to reduce the volume of escalations.  
  • Streamline hand-offs—automate routing so that the moment a ticket is flagged for L-2 (or engineering), it hits the specialist’s queue with high priority.  
  • Report and visualize “queue time” between activities (e.g. Escalate  Investigate, Investigate  Resolve) to surface slow spots and drive continuous improvement.  

By focusing on tighter SLAs around escalations, better shift-coverage for specialist teams, and more robust triage at Level-1, you can eliminate the long “waiting windows” that today stretch some tickets to 24–48 hours.
