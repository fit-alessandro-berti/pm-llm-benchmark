This visualization appears to be a workflow or process diagram with logical operators. The main diagram shows a process flow starting from node 'a' labeled "register request" and ending at node 'z' labeled "end". The process includes various steps such as examining thoroughly (node b), examining casually (node c), checking ticket (node d), making decisions (node e), reinitiating requests (node f), paying compensation (node g), and rejecting requests (node h).

At the bottom right of the image, there's a legend or reference box showing different types of logical operators:
- XOR-split and XOR-join
- AND-split and AND-join
- OR-split and OR-join

The nodes are connected by arrows and dots indicating the flow and logic of the process. The diagram appears to represent a business process, possibly for handling some kind of request or claim system, with different paths depending on the examination and decision outcomes.

The workflow shows multiple possible paths and loops, particularly around the examination and reinitiation steps, suggesting an iterative process with different possible outcomes.
