### Analysis and Labeling of Manufacturing Activities

To infer the activities being performed on the manufacturing assembly line, we will analyze the patterns in the sensor readings and group related events accordingly. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:

### **Step 1: Identify Distinct Patterns in Sensor Readings**
We observe the following patterns in the sensor data:

1. **Idle State:**
   - **Characteristics:** 
     - Temperature ≈ 20°C
     - Pressure ≈ 1 bar
     - Vibration Level ≈ 0 Hz
     - Material Flow ≈ 0 units/s
     - Tool Position ≈ 0 mm
     - Energy Consumption ≈ 0.5 kWh
   - **Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
   - **Interpretation:** These events represent periods when the machine is likely idle or in a standby state, as all sensor readings are at their baseline levels.

2. **Cutting Operation:**
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Temperature increases from 20°C to 55-58°C
     - Vibration Level increases from 0 Hz to 30-38 Hz
     - Material Flow increases to 5 units/s
     - Tool Position increases from 0 mm to 5-10 mm
     - Energy Consumption increases to 2.0-3.0 kWh
   - **Events:** 4, 5, 6
   - **Interpretation:** These readings suggest a cutting operation, as the increase in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption indicates mechanical work being performed on the material.

3. **Welding or High-Energy Operation:**
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Temperature spikes to 80°C
     - Vibration Level spikes to 50 Hz
     - Material Flow drops to 0 units/s
     - Tool Position remains at 15 mm
     - Energy Consumption spikes to 5.0 kWh
   - **Events:** 9
   - **Interpretation:** The significant spike in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption, coupled with a halt in material flow, suggests a high-energy operation such as welding or a similar process.

4. **Cooling or Reset Phase:**
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Temperature decreases to 30-40°C
     - Vibration Level decreases to 10 Hz
     - Material Flow decreases to 2 units/s
     - Tool Position remains at 15 mm
     - Energy Consumption decreases to 2.0 kWh
   - **Events:** 7, 8
   - **Interpretation:** These readings suggest a cooling or reset phase following a high-energy operation, as the temperature and vibration levels are decreasing.

5. **Assembly or Preparation Phase:**
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Temperature remains low at 20-25°C
     - Vibration Level is low at 0-5 Hz
     - Material Flow is low at 1 unit/s
     - Tool Position increases to 20 mm
     - Energy Consumption is moderate at 1.5 kWh
   - **Events:** 10, 11, 12
   - **Interpretation:** These readings suggest an assembly or preparation phase, as the low temperature, low vibration, and steady material flow indicate a controlled process of joining or preparing components.

### **Step 2: Assign Labels to Each Group of Events**
Based on the patterns identified, we assign the following labels:

1. **Idle State:**
   - **Label:** "Idle"
   - **Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
   - **Rationale:** All sensor readings are at baseline levels, indicating no active manufacturing processes.

2. **Cutting Operation:**
   - **Label:** "Cutting Metal"
   - **Events:** 4, 5, 6
   - **Rationale:** The increase in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption, along with steady material flow, suggests a cutting process.

3. **Welding or High-Energy Operation:**
   - **Label:** "Welding"
   - **Events:** 9
   - **Rationale:** The significant spike in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption, with halted in material flow, indicates a high-energy operation such as welding.

4. **Cooling or Reset Phase:**
   - **Label:** "Cooling"
   - **Events:** 7, 8
   - **Rationale:** The decrease in temperature and vibration levels suggests a cooling or reset phase following a high-energy operation.

5. **Assembly or Preparation Phase:**
   - **Label:** "Assembling Parts"
   - **Events:** 10, 11, 12
   - **Rationale:** The low temperature, low vibration, and steady material flow indicate a controlled process of joining or preparing components.

| Activity Label       | Events | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Idle                 | 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15 | Machine is in a standby or idle state.                                     |
| Cutting Metal        | 4, 5, 6 | Machine is performing a cutting operation, as indicated by increased temperature, vibration, and energy consumption. |
| Welding              | 9      | Machine is performing a high-energy operation, likely welding, as indicated by a significant spike in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption. |
| Cooling              | 7, 8   | Machine is in a cooling or reset phase, following a high-energy operation. |
| Assembling Parts     | 10, 11, 12 | Machine is performing an assembly or preparation process, as indicated by low temperature, low vibration, and steady material flow. |

### **Step 4: Rationale for Label Assignments**
- **Idle:** The baseline readings indicate no active processes.
- **Cutting Metal:** The increase in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption suggests mechanical work being performed on the material.
- **Welding:** The significant spike in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption, with halted in material flow, indicates a high-energy operation.
- **Cooling:** The decrease in temperature and vibration levels suggests a cooling or reset phase.
- **Assembling Parts:** The low temperature, low vibration, and steady material flow indicate a controlled process of joining or preparing components.
