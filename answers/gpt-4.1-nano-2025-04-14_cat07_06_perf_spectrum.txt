This visualization appears to be a data flow or process diagram, likely a Sankey diagram, illustrating two types of transaction activities over time:

- The **top section** (gray) represents "Send Fine," indicating transactions related to fines being issued or sent.
- The **bottom section** (reddish) represents "Send for Credit Collection," indicating transactions related to credit collection efforts.

The horizontal timeline spans from January 25, 2000, to April 24, 2013. 

Vertical lines (or flows) connecting the two sections show the transitions or relationships between these two transaction types over the given period. The thickness and color intensity of the flows may indicate the volume or frequency of activities at different points in time, with darker or thicker flows representing higher activity.

Overall, the diagram visualizes how certain financial or administrative activities (fines and credit collections) evolved and interconnected across the specified timeframe.
