Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a DuckDB SQL query that filters out certain cases from an event log. The goal is to exclude events from cases that have a specific sequence of activities with a time gap greater than 5 days between two of them. Then return all other events.

First, I need to understand the requirements clearly. The main steps are:

1. Identify cases with the exact sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order', with no other events in between.
2. Among those cases, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. Exclude these cases from the final result. So, return all events except those from the cases that meet both conditions.

Let me break it down.

For step 1: Finding the sequence. Since the events must be in direct succession, I need to look for consecutive events in each case. For example, in a case, the first event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order', with no other events in between.

How can I find such sequences in DuckDB? Maybe using window functions to track the previous activity and the one before that. Alternatively, using self-joins or lateral joins to check the sequence.

Another approach: For each case, order the events by timestamp, then check if there's a triplet where activity1 is 'Approve...', activity2 is 'Create...', activity3 is 'Confirm...', and the timestamps are in order with no gaps.

But how to do that in SQL? Let's think about using window functions. For each event in a case, I can look at the previous two events. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, for each case, find all instances where 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' with no events in between.

Alternatively, for each case, order the events by timestamp, then check for the sequence. For example, for each event that is 'Create Order', check if the previous event in the same case is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and the next event is 'Confirm Order'. But that might not capture all cases where the sequence is in order with no other events in between.

Wait, the problem says the three activities must be in direct succession. So, for a case, the events must be ordered such that after 'Approve Purchase Requisition' comes 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order', with no other events in between. So, the timestamps of these three events must be in order, and the 'Create Order' must immediately follow 'Approve', and 'Confirm' immediately follows 'Create'.

But how to check that? For each case, we need to find events where:

- There exists an event A with activity 'Approve...', then an event B with 'Create Order' that is the next event in the case, and then an event C with 'Confirm Order' that is the next after B.

Alternatively, for each case, order the events by timestamp, then check for the sequence.

Another approach is to use window functions to assign row numbers and check the activities in each row. For example, for each case, order by timestamp, then for each row, check if the current activity is 'Create Order', the previous activity is 'Approve...', and the next activity is 'Confirm...'.

But how to do that in SQL. Let's think about using a CTE with row numbers.

Let me outline the steps:

First, for each case, order the events by timestamp. Then, for each event, check if it's the second in a triplet where the previous is 'Approve...', and the next is 'Confirm...'.

But how to get the previous and next activity for each event?

In DuckDB, we can use the LAG and LEAD functions. For example, for each event in a case, ordered by timestamp, we can get the previous activity (LAG) and the next activity (LEAD). However, that would only check if the current event is 'Create Order', and the previous is 'Approve...', and the next is 'Confirm...'.

Wait, that would capture the case where in the ordered list of events for a case, there's a sequence like Approve, Create, Confirm with no other events in between. Because if the current event is Create Order, the previous is Approve, and the next is Confirm, then those three are consecutive.

Yes, that seems right. So for each event in the case, ordered by timestamp, if:

- The current activity is 'Create Order'

- The previous activity (LAG) is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

- The next activity (LEAD) is 'Confirm Order'

Then this case has the required sequence.

So, first, I can write a CTE that for each event in the event_log, ordered by case_id and timestamp, compute the previous and next activities.

But how to order by case_id and timestamp? Let's think: For each case, we need to order events by timestamp. So, we can use a window function to assign a row number per case, ordered by timestamp.

But for LAG and LEAD, we need to partition by case_id and order by timestamp. So, for each case, the events are ordered by timestamp. Then, for each event, LAG(activity, 1) over (partition by case_id order by timestamp) gives the previous activity, and LEAD(activity, 1) gives the next activity.

So, the first step is to find all events where:

- activity is 'Create Order'

- previous activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

- next activity is 'Confirm Order'

These events are part of the sequence. Then, for those events, we can get their case_id.

But then, we need to check the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. How to get that?

For the 'Create Order' event, we can get its timestamp, and for the next event (which is 'Confirm Order'), get its timestamp. Then, compute the difference.

So, in the same CTE, we can also get the previous timestamp (LAG(timestamp, 1)), current timestamp, and next timestamp (LEAD(timestamp, 1)).

Once we have that, for each 'Create Order' event that is part of the sequence, we can compute the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. Then, if that time is more than 5 days, we need to exclude the case.

So, the steps are:

1. For each event in the event_log, ordered by case_id and timestamp, compute LAG(activity, 1), LEAD(activity, 1), LAG(timestamp, 1), LEAD(timestamp, 1).

2. Find all events where activity is 'Create Order', previous activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and next activity is 'Confirm Order'. These are the middle events of the sequence.

3. For these events, calculate the time between the current event (Create Order) and the next event (Confirm Order). If that time is more than 5 days, then the case should be excluded.

4. Collect all case_ids that meet this condition.

5. Finally, return all events from the event_log that are not in these case_ids.

But how to implement this in SQL?

Let me structure this.

First, create a CTE that finds the cases that meet the sequence and time condition.

WITH sequence_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LAG(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence_events
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Create Order' 
        AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
        AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_timestamp - prev_timestamp) > interval '5 days'
)

Then, the final result is all events not in filtered_cases.

Wait, but the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is next_timestamp - current timestamp? Because the current event is Create Order, and the next event is Confirm Order. So, the time between Create and Confirm is next_timestamp - timestamp.

But in the CTE, the current event's timestamp is timestamp, and the next_timestamp is the Confirm Order's timestamp.

So, the difference is next_timestamp - timestamp.

But how to compute that in DuckDB? DuckDB uses standard SQL interval arithmetic. So, if the timestamps are in a datetime format, then subtracting them would give an interval.

So, the condition would be:

(next_timestamp - timestamp) > interval '5 days'

But need to make sure that the timestamps are in the correct format. Assuming that the timestamp column is a datetime type, this should work.

But in the CTE, the current event is 'Create Order', and the next activity is 'Confirm Order'. So, for each such event, we can compute the time between the current timestamp and the next_timestamp.

So, in the filtered_cases CTE, we select case_ids where that difference is more than 5 days.

Once we have those case_ids, we exclude all events from those cases.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases)

But need to make sure that the filtered_cases is correctly calculated.

But wait, in the sequence_events CTE, for each event, we have the prev and next activities. However, for the 'Create Order' event, the next_activity is 'Confirm Order', and the next_timestamp is the timestamp of that event. So, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is next_timestamp - current timestamp.

But in the code above, the condition is (next_timestamp - prev_timestamp) > interval '5 days' — that's incorrect. Because prev_timestamp is the timestamp of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event, and next_timestamp is the 'Confirm Order' event. So the difference between prev_timestamp and next_timestamp is the time between the first and third event. But the problem requires the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' to be more than 5 days. So, the correct difference is next_timestamp - timestamp (current event's timestamp).

So the condition should be (next_timestamp - timestamp) > interval '5 days'.

Therefore, in the filtered_cases CTE, the WHERE clause should be:

activity = 'Create Order' 
AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
AND (next_timestamp - timestamp) > interval '5 days'

But how to handle the case where the next_timestamp is NULL? For example, if the 'Confirm Order' is the last event in the case. But in that case, the next_activity would be NULL, so the condition next_activity = 'Confirm Order' would not be met. Therefore, the code should handle that.

But since we are checking next_activity = 'Confirm Order', then next_timestamp would not be NULL in those cases.

So, the CTE should work.

Now, putting it all together.

But what about cases where there are multiple instances of the sequence? For example, a case might have the sequence twice. But the filtered_cases uses SELECT DISTINCT case_id, so even if there are multiple instances, the case_id is only listed once.

Now, the final query would be:

WITH sequence_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LAG(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence_events
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Create Order' 
        AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
        AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_timestamp - timestamp) > interval '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases)

But wait, in DuckDB, the interval syntax might be different. For example, in some databases, you might use '5 days' as an interval, but in DuckDB, it's possible that you need to use a specific format. Let me check.

In DuckDB, the interval can be written as interval '5 days', but I need to confirm. Alternatively, you can calculate the difference in days using date_part or extracting days. However, the problem says "more than 5 days", which is a time duration, not a calendar day. So, if the timestamps are datetime, then subtracting them gives an interval, and comparing to interval '5 days' should work.

But I need to make sure that the timestamps are in a format that allows subtraction. If they are stored as TIMESTAMP, then yes.

Another point: the LAG and LEAD functions in DuckDB. Are they available? Yes, DuckDB supports window functions including LAG and LEAD.

Now, possible edge cases. For example, if a case has the sequence but the time between Create and Confirm is exactly 5 days. Then it's not excluded. Only if it's more than 5 days.

Another edge case: if the sequence is part of a longer sequence. For example, Approve, Create, Confirm, then another activity. But in this case, the next_activity for Create is Confirm, so it's still captured.

But if the sequence is Approve, Create, Confirm, then another activity, then the Create event's next_activity is Confirm, and that's correct.

Now, testing this query.

Let me think of a sample case.

Case 1:

Events:

Approve (t1), Create (t2), Confirm (t3), other (t4)

Here, for the Create event, prev_activity is Approve, next_activity is Confirm. The time between Create and Confirm is t3 - t2. If that's more than 5 days, then this case is excluded.

Another case where the sequence is part of a longer chain, but the time between Create and Confirm is within 5 days. Then it's not excluded.

Now, what about cases where the sequence occurs multiple times? For example, Approve, Create, Confirm, Approve, Create, Confirm. Each Create event would be checked. If any of them has the time between Create and Confirm more than 5 days, then the case is excluded.

The DISTINCT in filtered_cases ensures that even if multiple instances in the same case meet the condition, the case is only excluded once.

Now, the final query returns all events except those in the filtered_cases.

I think this should work.

But let me check for possible errors.

One thing: the LAG and LEAD functions are applied over the entire event_log, partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp. That's correct.

Another thing: the filtered_cases CTE selects case_ids where the sequence exists and the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days. Then, all events from these cases are excluded.

Yes.

So, the final query should be as written above.

Now, translating that into DuckDB SQL.

But DuckDB uses the standard SQL syntax for intervals. So, the interval '5 days' should be correct. However, in some SQL dialects, you might need to use a different syntax. For example, in PostgreSQL, it's interval '5 days', which is what I used.

But I need to make sure that DuckDB accepts this. According to DuckDB documentation, interval literals are supported. For example, '5 days' is valid.

Another thing: the subtraction of two timestamps in DuckDB returns an interval. So, next_timestamp - timestamp would give the interval between the two events, and comparing that to interval '5 days' should work.

So, the query should be correct.

Another possible issue: if the timestamps are not in the same timezone or have time components. However, the problem states that the timestamps are datetime values, so assuming that the difference is calculated correctly as per the datetime values.

Another thing: the 'interval' keyword. In some SQL versions, you might need to use a different syntax. But DuckDB should support it.

Therefore, the final query should be as written.
</think>

To solve the problem of identifying and excluding events from specific process instances (`case_id`) that follow a certain sequence of activities and meet a time constraint, we can use a structured SQL query with DuckDB's window functions and filtering capabilities.

###  **Objective Recap**

We are given a table `event_log` with the following columns:

- `case_id`: Identifies the process instance.
- `activity`: Name of the executed activity.
- `timestamp`: Datetime of the event.

We must:

1. Identify any `case_id` that contains the **exact sequence** of activities:
   - `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`
   - `'Create Order'`
   - `'Confirm Order'`
   in **direct succession** (i.e., no other event between them).

2. Among those cases, **filter further** to only those where the time **between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is **more than 5 days**.

3. **Exclude** all events from these specific `case_id`s from the final output.

---

###  **Implementation Plan**

We'll proceed in three main steps:

1. **Identify the problematic cases** using window functions (`LAG` and `LEAD`) to detect the exact sequence and time condition.
2. **Filter out the identified `case_id`s** from the final result.
3. **Return all events not associated with these cases**.

---

###  **SQL Query**

```sql
WITH sequence_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence_events
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Create Order' 
        AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
        AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_timestamp - timestamp) > interval '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```

---

###  **Explanation**

- **`sequence_events` CTE**:
  - For each event, we compute the **previous** and **next** activity and timestamp using `LAG` and `LEAD` functions.
  - This allows us to identify events that are **directly preceded by** `'Approve Purchase Requisition'` and **directly followed by** `'Confirm Order'`.

- **`filtered_cases` CTE**:
  - Filters only those events where the current activity is `'Create Order'`, and the sequence is correct.
  - It then checks if the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is **more than 5 days** using the difference of the timestamps.
  - `DISTINCT` ensures each `case_id` is only listed once, even if the sequence appears multiple times within the same case.

- **Final Query**:
  - Returns all events **except** those from the `case_id`s identified in `filtered_cases`.

---

###  **Time Calculation Notes**

- The difference between two `TIMESTAMP` values in DuckDB returns an `INTERVAL`, which can be directly compared to `interval '5 days'`.
- This ensures we are measuring **elapsed time**, not calendar days, which is the correct interpretation of the requirement.

---

###  **Edge Cases Considered**

- Cases with **multiple instances** of the sequence: Only one `case_id` is excluded, even if the condition is met multiple times.
- Cases where the **sequence is not complete**: These are ignored (e.g., missing the `'Confirm Order'` event).
- Cases with **correct sequence but within 5 days**: These are **not excluded** and remain in the final output.

---

###  **Conclusion**

This query effectively filters out the unwanted `case_id`s that match the specified sequence and time condition, while returning all other events from the `event_log` as required. It is efficient and leverages DuckDB's window function capabilities for clarity and performance.
