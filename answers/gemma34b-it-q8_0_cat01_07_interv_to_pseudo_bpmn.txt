Okay, here’s a BPMN-like textual process model derived from the provided interview transcripts. I’ve aimed for clarity, consistency, and representation of potential variations.

**Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

**1. Start:** Invoice Received (via email)

**2. Activity: Initial Validation**
   * **Participant:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   * **Description:** Mary checks for a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
   * **Decision:** Does Invoice have a PO number?
      * **Yes:** Proceed to Activity 3.
      * **No:**  Activity 4 (Request PO Details from Supplier).

**3. Activity: PO Confirmation**
   * **Participant:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   * **Description:** Log invoice into accounting system.
   * **Flow:** Forward invoice to Purchasing Department for goods/services receipt confirmation.

**4. Activity: Supplier Confirmation**
   * **Participant:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
   * **Description:** Dan checks PO details (quantities, prices, delivery charges).
   * **Decision:** Do PO details match invoice?
      * **Yes:** Proceed to Activity 5.
      * **No:** Activity 6 (Contact Supplier or Hold Invoice).

**5. Activity: PO Confirmation (Purchasing)**
   * **Participant:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
   * **Description:** Send confirmation email to Accounts Payable.

**6. Activity: Supplier Issue/Discrepancy**
   * **Participant:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
   * **Description:** Contact supplier directly or request a corrected invoice from Mary.

**7. Activity: Manager Notification & Review**
   * **Participant:** Department Manager (Carlos)
   * **Description:** Carlos receives notification with invoice details, PO, and confirmation.
   * **Decision:** Are invoice details acceptable?
      * **Yes:** Proceed to Activity 8.
      * **No:** Activity 9 (Reject/Investigate Invoice).

**8. Activity: Manager Approval**
   * **Participant:** Department Manager (Carlos)
   * **Description:** Carlos approves invoice in the system.

**9. Activity: Invoice Investigation/Rejection**
   * **Participant:** Department Manager (Carlos)
   * **Description:** Carlos rejects invoice or requests further investigation from Mary.

**10. Activity: Exception Handling (Escalation)**
    * **Participant:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
    * **Description:** Rita handles invoices that cannot be matched to a PO or have unresolved discrepancies.
    * **Flow:**  Contact suppliers or coordinate between departments.  May involve creating a retrospective PO or rejecting the invoice.

**11. Activity: Normal Flow Continuation**
    * **Participant:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
    * **Description:**  Once exceptions are resolved, the invoice returns to the normal flow.

**12. Activity: Payment Scheduling**
   * **Participant:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   * **Description:** Schedule invoice for payment.

**13. Activity: Supplier Involvement (Indirect)**
    * **Participant:** Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
    * **Description:** Karen is involved when invoices don’t match agreed-upon terms.  Provides PO numbers or corrects pricing based on contracts.

**14. End:** Invoice Scheduled for Payment

**Notes & Uncertainties:**

*   **Manager Approval Timing:** The timing of Manager approval is somewhat fluid.  It’s triggered after PO confirmation and invoice matching, but can be delayed if issues arise.
*   **Retrospective POs:** The creation of retrospective POs is a specific exception handling scenario.
*   **System Notifications:** The system automatically sends notifications to the Manager.
*   **Supplier Loop-in:**  The involvement of the Supplier Relationship Manager is primarily reactive – triggered by discrepancies.

This textual model provides a structured representation of the invoice approval process, incorporating the key insights from the interview transcripts.  It’s designed to be easily converted into a BPMN diagram.  Further refinement could be achieved with more detailed data from the process mining study.
