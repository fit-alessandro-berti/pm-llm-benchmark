We are going to break this down into steps:

 1. For each case_id, we want to get the ordered sequence of activities (by timestamp). We can use string_agg to form the variant string, but note: we must order by timestamp.
    However, note: the problem says to group by the complete activity sequence. We can form a string that represents the sequence (e.g., using string_agg with a delimiter) and then use that for grouping.

 2. We then count the number of cases per variant and determine the top K variants. We'll use the variant string as the grouping key.

 3. We want to return all events from the original event log that belong to cases that are in the top K variants.

 However, note: we are to return the events, not just the case counts. So we need to first compute the top K variants, then get the case_ids that have those variants, and then select all events for those case_ids.

 Steps in the query:

 Step 1: Compute the variant for each case.
   We can do:
     SELECT case_id, 
            string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id

 Step 2: Count the cases per variant and get the top K variants (let's say K=3 for example, but we can make it a parameter).
   We can do:
     WITH variants AS (
         SELECT case_id, 
                string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
         FROM event_log
         GROUP BY case_id
     )
     SELECT variant, count(*) as case_count
     FROM variants
     GROUP BY variant
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 3

 Step 3: Now, we want to get the case_ids that have these top variants. We can do that by joining the variants CTE with the top variants.

 Step 4: Finally, we select all events from the original event_log for the case_ids that are in the top variants.

 However, note: we must be cautious because if we use the string_agg without any ordering, we might get the same string for the same sequence, but note that the problem says the order is by timestamp.

 Let's write the full query:

 We assume K=3 for the top variants.

 Alternatively, we can use a window function to rank the variants by frequency and then filter by rank.

 Let me structure the query:

 WITH case_variants AS (
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
 ),
 variant_counts AS (
   SELECT
     variant,
     COUNT(*) as case_count,
     RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rank_val
   FROM case_variants
   GROUP BY variant
 )
 SELECT event_log.*
 FROM event_log
 WHERE case_id IN (
   SELECT case_id
   FROM case_variants
   WHERE variant IN (
     SELECT variant
     FROM variant_counts
     WHERE rank_val <= 3  -- top 3 variants
   )
 )
 ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

 However, note: the RANK function will assign the same rank to variants with the same count, so if we have more than 3 variants with the same count as the third one, we might get more than 3 variants.
 But the problem says "top K variants", meaning if there are ties we might want to include them? The problem does not specify, but typically in top K we might want to include ties.

 Alternatively, we can use DENSE_RANK or just use LIMIT with a subquery that gets the top K by count, but then we have to handle ties arbitrarily.

 Since the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", and if we want exactly K variants (breaking ties arbitrarily) we can do:

   SELECT variant
   FROM variant_counts
   ORDER BY case_count DESC
   LIMIT 3

 But if we want to include all variants that are in the top K by frequency (so if there are ties at the K-th place, we include all of them) then we can use:

   WITH variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant
   ),
   ranked_variants AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       case_count,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) as rank_val
     FROM variant_counts
   )
   SELECT variant
   FROM ranked_variants
   WHERE rank_val <= 3

 But note: DENSE_RANK will assign the same rank to ties, and then the next distinct count will get the next rank. So if we have:
   Counts: 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8
   DENSE_RANK: 1,1,2,2,3,3 -> so if K=3, we get all 6.

 Alternatively, if we want to get the top 3 distinct counts (so the top 3 counts, and then all variants having any of these top 3 counts) then we can do:

   WITH variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant
   ),
   top_counts AS (
     SELECT DISTINCT case_count
     FROM variant_counts
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 3
   )
   SELECT variant
   FROM variant_counts
   WHERE case_count IN (SELECT case_count FROM top_counts)

 This will get all variants that have counts that are in the top 3 distinct counts.

 The problem does not specify the behavior in case of ties, so we must choose one.

 Since the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", I think the intended meaning is to get the K most frequent variants (so if there are ties at the K-th place, we might get more than K). 
 However, the problem also says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

 Let me re-read: "determine the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)."

 I think the typical interpretation is to get the K variants with the highest counts, and if there are ties at the K-th place, we include all of them. So we want to use DENSE_RANK or a method that includes ties.

 But note: the problem says "top K", which might be ambiguous. However, in many contexts, top K includes ties.

 Alternatively, we can use:

   WITH variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant
   ),
   ranked_variants AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       case_count,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) as rank_val
     FROM variant_counts
   )
   SELECT variant
   FROM ranked_variants
   WHERE rank_val <= 3

 This will assign the same rank to ties, and then skip the next rank? Actually, RANK will do: 
   Counts: 10, 10, 9, 9, 8 -> RANK: 1,1,3,3,5. So if we take rank<=3, we get the first two and the two with count 9.

 But note: the problem does not specify whether we want the top 3 distinct counts or the top 3 variants (by rank, which may include more than 3 if there are ties).

 Let me assume we want the top 3 variants by frequency, meaning we want the 3 variants with the highest counts, and if there are ties at the third place, we include all that are tied.

 However, note: the problem says "the top K variants", which might be interpreted as the K variants with the highest counts (so if there are ties, we might have to break them arbitrarily to get exactly K). 
 But the problem does not specify how to break ties, so it's safer to include ties.

 Since the problem says "Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants by their frequency", I think we want to include all variants that are in the top K when ordered by frequency (so if K=3, we want the 3 most frequent variants, but if there are multiple variants with the same frequency as the third one, we include them too).

 How to do that? We can use:

   WITH variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant
   ),
   min_count_in_top_k AS (
     SELECT case_count
     FROM variant_counts
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET K-1
   )
   SELECT variant
   FROM variant_counts
   WHERE case_count >= (SELECT case_count FROM min_count_in_top_k)

 But note: if there are less than K variants, then OFFSET K-1 will return nothing, so we need to handle that.

 Alternatively, we can use the window function PERCENT_RANK or something else, but I think the above method is simpler.

 However, DuckDB might not allow OFFSET in a subquery like that without a row? We can use:

   SELECT case_count
   FROM variant_counts
   ORDER BY case_count DESC
   LIMIT 1 OFFSET K-1

 If there are less than K rows, then we get nothing, and then the condition `case_count >= NULL` will be NULL, so we won't get any rows. So we need to handle that.

 Alternatively, we can use:

   WITH variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant
   ),
   ranked_variants AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       case_count,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) as rank_val
     FROM variant_counts
   )
   SELECT variant
   FROM ranked_variants
   WHERE rank_val <= K

 This will give us all variants that have a rank (by distinct count) less than or equal to K. Note: DENSE_RANK will assign the same rank to the same count, and then the next distinct count gets rank+1.

 Example: 
   Counts: 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8
   DENSE_RANK: 1,1,2,2,3,3
   If K=3, we get all 6.

 This matches the requirement of including all variants that are in the top K distinct counts.

 But note: the problem says "top K variants", which might be interpreted as the K most frequent variants (so if there are 6 variants, but we want top 3, we might only want 3). 
 However, the problem does not specify, so I think including all variants that are in the top K distinct frequency groups is acceptable.

 Alternatively, if the problem means to return exactly K variants (breaking ties arbitrarily) then we would use:

   SELECT variant
   FROM variant_counts
   ORDER BY case_count DESC, variant  -- to break ties consistently, we order by variant as well
   LIMIT K

 Since the problem does not specify, I will assume we want to include all variants that have a frequency that is at least the frequency of the K-th variant (so including ties). 

 I think the intended meaning is to include ties, so I will use the DENSE_RANK method.

 Let's write the full query with K=3:

 WITH case_variants AS (
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
 ),
 variant_counts AS (
   SELECT
     variant,
     COUNT(*) as case_count
   FROM case_variants
   GROUP BY variant
 ),
 ranked_variants AS (
   SELECT
     variant,
     case_count,
     DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) as rank_val
   FROM variant_counts
 )
 SELECT event_log.*
 FROM event_log
 WHERE case_id IN (
   SELECT case_id
   FROM case_variants
   WHERE variant IN (
     SELECT variant
     FROM ranked_variants
     WHERE rank_val <= 3
   )
 )
 ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

 However, note: we are using DENSE_RANK, which ranks by distinct case_count in descending order. This will give us all variants that are in the top 3 distinct frequency groups.

 Let me test with an example:

   Suppose we have:
     Variant A: 10 cases
     Variant B: 10 cases
     Variant C: 9 cases
     Variant D: 9 cases
     Variant E: 8 cases
     Variant F: 8 cases
     Variant G: 7 cases

   We want top 3 variants by frequency. The distinct frequencies are: 10, 9, 8 (top 3 distinct counts). So we would include variants A, B, C, D, E, F.

   But note: the problem says "top K variants", which might be interpreted as the K variants with the highest counts (so we would want A, B, C, D, E, F if we include ties at the third place (8) but note that 8 is the third distinct count, but we have 6 variants). 

   Alternatively, if we want exactly 3 variants (so we break the tie at the second rank and take only 3), we would take A, B, and then we have to choose one of C or D for the third? But that doesn't make sense.

   I think the problem intends to include all variants that are in the top K by frequency, meaning if we have multiple variants with the same frequency, we include them. So we want to include all variants that have a frequency that is at least the K-th highest frequency.

   How to get the K-th highest frequency? We can use:

     SELECT case_count
     FROM variant_counts
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET K-1

   Then we get the K-th highest frequency (if there are less than K, then we get nothing). Then we take all variants with case_count >= that value.

   Let's do that:

   WITH case_variants AS (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
   ),
   variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant
   ),
   top_k_threshold AS (
     SELECT case_count
     FROM variant_counts
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET K-1
   )
   SELECT event_log.*
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
     SELECT case_id
     FROM case_variants
     WHERE variant IN (
       SELECT variant
       FROM variant_counts
       WHERE case_count >= (SELECT COALESCE((SELECT case_count FROM top_k_threshold), 0))
     )
   )
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

   But note: if there are less than K variants, then top_k_threshold will be empty, and we want to include all variants? Actually, if there are less than K variants, then we want to include all because we are taking the top K and there are less than K.

   We can handle that with COALESCE: if the subquery returns NULL, then we set the threshold to 0, so we include all variants (because every variant has case_count>=0).

   However, if we have K=3 and only 2 variants, then the OFFSET 2 will return nothing, so we set threshold to 0 and then we include all 2 variants.

   This method includes all variants that have a frequency at least the K-th highest frequency (which is the frequency of the variant at offset K-1). This method includes ties.

   Example: 
     Variants: A (10), B (10), C (9), D (9), E (8)
     K=3: we want to get the top 3 frequencies: the third highest frequency is 9 (because we have 10,10,9,9,8 -> the third distinct frequency is 9, but the third highest frequency in the ordered list is 9). 
     We want to include all variants with frequency>=9, so A, B, C, D.

   But note: the problem says "top K variants", and in this example, we are including 4 variants. This is because we are including all variants that are at least as frequent as the K-th variant.

   This is the typical way to do "top K with ties".

   So I will use this method.

   Let's write the query with K=3:

   WITH case_variants AS (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
   ),
   variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant
   ),
   top_k_threshold AS (
     SELECT case_count
     FROM variant_counts
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2  -- because K=3, so offset = K-1 = 2
   )
   SELECT event_log.*
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
     SELECT case_id
     FROM case_variants
     WHERE variant IN (
       SELECT variant
       FROM variant_counts
       WHERE case_count >= (SELECT COALESCE((SELECT case_count FROM top_k_threshold), 0))
     )
   )
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

   But note: if there are multiple variants with the same case_count, and we are using OFFSET, we are taking the third highest case_count (which might be the same as the second if there are many ties). 

   Example: 
     case_count: 10,10,10,9,9,8
     We want the top 3 variants. The third highest distinct count is 10 (because the first three are 10). So we take all variants with case_count>=10, which are the first three.

   This is correct.

   Another example: 
     case_count: 10,10,9,9,8,8
     We want the top 3. The third highest case_count (using OFFSET 2) is 9 (because we skip two 10s and then take the next, which is 9). Then we take all variants with case_count>=9, which are the first four.

   This is the behavior we want: we are including all variants that are at least as frequent as the third most frequent variant.

   So I think this is the correct approach.

   However, note: the problem says "top K variants", and in the example above we got 4 variants for K=3. This is standard for including ties.

   Let's write the final query with a parameter K. We can use a prepared statement or we can set a variable. In DuckDB, we can use a macro or we can just replace K with a number.

   Since the prompt does not specify how to parameterize, we'll just use a literal number.

   Let me set K=3.

   Final query:

   WITH case_variants AS (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
   ),
   variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant
   ),
   top_k_threshold AS (
     SELECT case_count
     FROM variant_counts
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2
   )
   SELECT event_log.*
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
     SELECT case_id
     FROM case_variants
     WHERE variant IN (
       SELECT variant
       FROM variant_counts
       WHERE case_count >= (SELECT COALESCE((SELECT case_count FROM top_k_threshold), 0))
     )
   )
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

   But note: if there are no events, then the top_k_threshold will be empty and we set the threshold to 0, which is safe.

   However, we might want to use a more efficient method if the event log is large. The string_agg might be expensive, but we are grouping by case_id and then again by variant.

   Alternatively, we can avoid the string_agg for the entire log by using a window function to get the variant for each case and then use that to compute the counts, but I think this is acceptable.

   Let me test with a small example.

   Example event_log:

   case_id | activity | timestamp
   --------+----------+----------
   1       | A        | 1
   1       | B        | 2
   2       | A        | 1
   2       | B        | 2
   3       | A        | 1
   3       | C        | 2

   Then for case_variants:
     case1: 'A->B'
     case2: 'A->B'
     case3: 'A->C'

   variant_counts:
     'A->B': 2
     'A->C': 1

   Now, for top K=2:
     We want the top 2 variants. The second highest count (offset 1) is 1.
     So we take all variants with count>=1, which are both variants.

   So we return all events for case1, case2, case3.

   If we set K=1:
     The first highest count (offset 0) is 2.
     So we take variants with count>=2 -> only 'A->B'
     Then we return events for case1 and case2.

   This matches.

   So the query is correct.

   However, note: the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

   We are doing that.

   One more note: the string_agg uses '->' as delimiter. This is arbitrary and must be chosen such that it does not appear in the activity names. If it might appear, we can use a different delimiter or a method that does not require string aggregation (like array_agg and then compare arrays). But the problem does not specify, so we assume that '->' is safe.

   Alternatively, we can use array_agg to form an array of activities and then use that for grouping? But then we cannot use string_agg for the variant representation, but we can use the array for grouping.

   However, the problem says "group cases by their complete activity sequence", so we can use the array as the variant representation.

   But note: DuckDB supports grouping by arrays? Let me check: yes, DuckDB supports arrays and they are comparable. So we can do:

     WITH case_variants AS (
       SELECT 
         case_id,
         array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as variant_array
       FROM event_log
       GROUP BY case_id
     )

   Then we can group by variant_array.

   This might be more robust if activities contain the string '->'. But the problem does not specify, so we can use either.

   Since the problem says "ordered sequence of activities", using an array is more natural.

   Let me change to array_agg:

   WITH case_variants AS (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as variant_array
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
   ),
   variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant_array,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant_array
   ),
   top_k_threshold AS (
     SELECT case_count
     FROM variant_counts
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2
   )
   SELECT event_log.*
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
     SELECT case_id
     FROM case_variants
     WHERE variant_array IN (
       SELECT variant_array
       FROM variant_counts
       WHERE case_count >= (SELECT COALESCE((SELECT case_count FROM top_k_threshold), 0))
     )
   )
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

   This is better because it does not depend on a delimiter.

   However, note: the problem does not specify the representation of the variant, but we are only using it for grouping, so the array is fine.

   But the problem says "return all events", so we don't need to output the variant, we just use it for filtering.

   So I will use the array method.

   Final query:

   WITH case_variants AS (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as variant_array
     FROM event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
   ),
   variant_counts AS (
     SELECT
       variant_array,
       COUNT(*) as case_count
     FROM case_variants
     GROUP BY variant_array
   ),
   top_k_threshold AS (
     SELECT case_count
     FROM variant_counts
     ORDER BY case_count DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2
   )
   SELECT event_log.*
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (
     SELECT case_id
     FROM case_variants
     WHERE variant_array IN (
       SELECT variant_array
       FROM variant_counts
       WHERE case_count >= (SELECT COALESCE((SELECT case_count FROM top_k_threshold), 0))
     )
   )
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

   This should work.

   However, note: the array_agg might be more expensive than string_agg, but it is more robust.

   We'll go with the array_agg.

   Let me set K=3, so offset is 2.

   If we want to make K configurable, we can use a prepared statement with a parameter, but since the prompt does not specify, we hardcode.

   Alternatively, we can use a variable in DuckDB. But the prompt does not specify, so we leave it as OFFSET 2 for K=3.

   If we want to change K, we change the OFFSET to K-1.

   So for the purpose of this benchmark, we write the query for K=3.

   Final answer.
</think>
To solve this problem, we need to identify the top K process variants based on their frequency in the event log and then retrieve all events associated with cases that follow these variants. The solution involves constructing sequences of activities per case, counting occurrences of each variant, and filtering the original events accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Construct Activity Sequences per Case**: Use `array_agg` to aggregate activities for each case in timestamp order, forming a sequence representing the process variant.
2. **Count Variant Frequencies**: Group cases by their activity sequences to count how many cases follow each variant.
3. **Identify Top K Variants**: Determine the top K variants by frequency using a window function to rank variants and filter based on the rank.
4. **Filter Events by Top Variants**: Retrieve all events from cases whose variants are among the top K, ensuring the output includes only relevant events.

### Solution Code
```sql

    SELECT
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence
    FROM event_log

),
variant_ranks AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS variant_rank
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
)
SELECT event_log.*
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_variants
    WHERE variant_sequence IN (
        SELECT variant_sequence
        FROM variant_ranks
        WHERE variant_rank <= 3  -- Replace 3 with K for top K variants
    )
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **case_variants CTE**: Aggregates activities for each case into an array ordered by timestamp, representing the process variant.
2. **variant_ranks CTE**: Counts cases per variant and assigns a rank to each variant based on frequency using `DENSE_RANK`, ensuring ties are handled correctly.
3. **Final Query**: Filters the original event log to include only events from cases whose variants are in the top K (rank  K). The results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain the sequence of events.

This approach efficiently identifies the most common process variants and retrieves all related events, ensuring correctness through proper aggregation and ranking. The use of `DENSE_RANK` ensures that all variants with frequencies matching the top K are included, even if there are ties.
