To solve this problem, we need to identify the top K process variants based on their frequency and return all events from cases that belong to these top variants. The solution involves constructing the activity sequence for each case, determining the frequency of each variant, ranking them, and then filtering the original event log to include only those cases that belong to the top K variants.

### Approach
1. **Extract Activity Sequences**: For each case, generate the ordered sequence of activities by sorting events by timestamp.
2. **Count Variant Frequencies**: Group the cases by their activity sequences to count how many cases follow each variant.
3. **Rank Variants by Frequency**: Use a ranking function to order variants by their frequency in descending order, ensuring ties are handled correctly.
4. **Filter Top K Variants**: Select the top K variants based on their rank.
5. **Retrieve Relevant Events**: Join back to the original event log to retrieve all events for cases belonging to the top K variants.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    LIST(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    case_count,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS variant_rank
  FROM variant_counts
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM ranked_variants
  WHERE variant_rank <= K
),
cases_in_top_k AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM case_variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_k_variants)
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN cases_in_top_k c
  ON el.case_id = c.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **case_variants CTE**: This CTE generates the ordered sequence of activities (variant) for each case by using the `LIST` function with an `ORDER BY` clause on the timestamp.
2. **variant_counts CTE**: This CTE groups the variants by their activity sequence and counts the number of cases for each variant.
3. **ranked_variants CTE**: This CTE assigns a rank to each variant using the `RANK()` window function, ordered by the count of cases in descending order. `RANK()` ensures that ties in counts receive the same rank, and subsequent ranks are adjusted accordingly.
4. **top_k_variants CTE**: This CTE filters the variants to include only those with a rank within the top K, effectively handling ties by including all variants with the same count as the K-th variant.
5. **cases_in_top_k CTE**: This CTE retrieves the case IDs that belong to the top K variants identified in the previous step.
6. **Final SELECT**: The final query joins the original event log with the filtered case IDs to retrieve all events for cases in the top K variants, ensuring the result includes only the relevant events ordered by case ID and timestamp.

This approach efficiently handles the identification of top process variants and ensures all relevant events are returned while maintaining the correct order of activities within each case.
