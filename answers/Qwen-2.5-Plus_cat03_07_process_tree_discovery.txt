To construct the process tree model based on the given event log, we need to identify the main flow of activities and account for optional repetitions such as requesting missing information and re-validation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the process tree should be structured:

1. **Main Flow**: The primary sequence involves receiving an application, validating the form, assessing eligibility, making an approval decision, sending confirmation, and archiving the case.
2. **Optional Loop**: There is an optional loop where "Request Missing Info" can occur multiple times, followed by re-validation before continuing with the main flow.

Based on this understanding, here is the final process tree structure:

```plaintext
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
    A = ProcessTree(label="Receive Application (RA)", parent=root)
    B = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
        C = ProcessTree(label="Validate Form (VF)", parent=B)
        D = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=B)
            E = ProcessTree(label="Validate Form (VF)", parent=D)
            F = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=D)
                G = ProcessTree(label="Request Missing Info (RMI)", parent=F)
                H = ProcessTree(label="Validate Form (VF)", parent=F)
            D.children.append(E)
            D.children.append(F)
        B.children.append(C)
        B.children.append(D)
    I = ProcessTree(label="Assess Eligibility (AE)", parent=root)
    J = ProcessTree(label="Approval Decision (AD)", parent=root)
    K = ProcessTree(label="Send Confirmation (SC)", parent=root)
    L = ProcessTree(label="Archive Case (AC)", parent=root)
    
    root.children.append(A)
    root.children.append(B)
    root.children.append(I)
    root.children.append(J)
    root.children.append(K)
    root.children.append(L)

# Setting parents explicitly for all children nodes
C.parent = B
E.parent = D
F.parent = D
G.parent = F
H.parent = F
I.parent = root
J.parent = root
K.parent = root
L.parent = root
```

### Explanation:
- **Root Node (`root`)**: This is a sequence operator that ensures the main flow of activities happens in order.
- **Node `A`**: Represents the activity "Receive Application (RA)" which starts the process.
- **Node `B`**: An XOR choice node that decides whether to directly validate the form or enter the loop for handling missing information.
  - **Node `C`**: Directly validates the form if no missing information is detected.
  - **Node `D`**: Represents the loop where validation might be repeated after requesting missing information.
    - **Node `E`**: Exit condition of the loop (validating the form).
    - **Node `F`**: Sequence inside the loop that includes requesting missing information and then validating the form again.
      - **Node `G`**: Activity "Request Missing Info (RMI)".
      - **Node `H`**: Activity "Validate Form (VF)" after requesting missing info.
- **Nodes `I`, `J`, `K`, `L`**: These represent the remaining activities in the main flow: "Assess Eligibility (AE)", "Approval Decision (AD)", "Send Confirmation (SC)", and "Archive Case (AC)" respectively.

This structure captures the main sequence while allowing for optional loops for handling missing information and re-validation, ensuring both fitness and simplicity.
