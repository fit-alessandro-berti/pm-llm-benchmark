The provided pseudo-BPMN (Business Process Model Notation) representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests which can be either "Standard" or "Custom". Here's a detailed explanation of each step in the process:

### Starting Point

- **Start Event**: This marks the beginning of the entire process, signaling that a customer has initiated a request.

### Request Type Verification

- **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**: This is a decision point where the system evaluates whether the incoming request is "Standard" or "Custom". The XOR (exclusive OR) gateway indicates there are two mutually exclusive paths forward based on this assessment:
  - If the request type is identified as Standard, the process follows one path.
  - If it's Custom, another distinct path is taken.

### Handling of Standard Requests

- **Task B1: Perform Standard Validation**: Once a request is confirmed to be Standard, standard validation procedures are applied. This could involve verifying information accuracy or ensuring compliance with predefined criteria necessary for proceeding without further custom checks.

- **Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks** (after Task B1):
  - The AND gateway signifies that multiple subtasks must all complete successfully before the process moves forward. These parallel tasks are:
    - **Task C1: Credit Check**: Verifies whether the customer has a good credit history.
    - **Task C2: Inventory Check**: Ensures there is sufficient stock to fulfill the request.

- **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**: Once all subtasks under this AND gateway have been completed, control moves forward. The join point indicates that both checks passed without needing any rework or further intervention.

### Task Completion and Delivery Date Calculation

- **Task D: Calculate Delivery Date**: After all parallel tasks are successfully completed, the next step is to calculate when the customer can expect their request to be fulfilled, based on inventory availability and other logistical considerations.

### Handling of Custom Requests

- **Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis**: If the initial assessment identifies a request as Custom, this task involves evaluating whether custom solutions are feasible given current resources or market conditions. This might include technical feasibility assessments or resource allocation planning.

### Determining Need for Approval

- **Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Needed?** Following either path (Standard or Custom), another decision is made to determine if further managerial approval is required before proceeding.
  - **If Yes**: The process moves to Task F and then an additional approval check:
    - **Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation** or **Task E2: Send Rejection Notice**
      - If approval is granted, the task involves generating a quotation for custom solutions (Task E1) or rejecting the request outright (Task E2).
  - **If No**: The process skips to Task G and directly generates the Final Invoice.

### Approval Outcomes

- **Task F: Obtain Manager Approval**:
  - If approval is obtained, it allows moving forward with further steps.
  - If not, a loop back occurs to either prepare for custom quotation (for Custom requests) or calculate delivery date (for Standard requests), prompting reassessment and potential rework before resuming.

### Final Steps

- **Task G: Generate Final Invoice**: This task is reached if all approvals are secured or automatically after fulfilling the conditions without requiring managerial approval.
  
- **Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer**: Regardless of the preceding steps, once invoicing is complete, a confirmation notification is sent to the customer confirming their request has been processed.

### Convergence and Loop Back

- The process design incorporates various gateways that serve as decision points where paths converge or diverge based on specific outcomes. These include:
  - **Parallel Checks** (AND) ensuring all necessary subtasks for Standard requests are completed.
  - **Approval Requirement** checks (XOR), which can loop back to either prepare custom quotations or recalculate delivery dates based on feedback from these checks.

### Purpose of Tasks and Conditions

- The process is structured to handle varying complexities in customer requests, ensuring that the right tasks are executed according to whether a request is standard or customized.
- Gateways determine when further actions (like approvals) are required, allowing for dynamic handling of exceptions without disrupting the main flow.
- Approvals ensure alignment with business policies and resource availability before proceeding with fulfillment.

Overall, this pseudo-BPMN model outlines a comprehensive workflow designed to efficiently manage customer requests by differentiating between standard and custom processes while ensuring that all necessary validations, approvals, and logistical planning are completed accurately.
