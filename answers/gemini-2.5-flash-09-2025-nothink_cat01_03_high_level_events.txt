## Aggregation of Low-Level Manufacturing Events into High-Level Process Steps

The goal is to transform the granular, machine-level event log into a concise and meaningful high-level process map. This transformation relies on identifying logical boundaries, shared objectives, and sequential dependencies among the low-level activities.

### Proposed High-Level Process Steps and Rationale

Based on the provided sample log, the manufacturing process for a single product (CaseID) can be segmented into four distinct, sequentially ordered stages:

| High-Level Step Name | Low-Level Activities Included | Rationale for Grouping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Material Intake & Setup** | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet | These events are preparatory and focus on getting the raw material (metal sheet) into the correct physical and thermal state before the main transformation (welding) begins. They involve initial handling, identification, positioning, and pre-conditioning. |
| **2. Core Assembly (Welding)** | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B | These events represent the primary value-add and transformation step. They are characterized by the use of specialized tools (welding tool) and the creation of the final structural form of the component. The activity 'Pick up welding tool' acts as a clear initiation point for this phase. |
| **3. Initial Quality Check & Surface Treatment** | Measure weld integrity, Apply protective coating, Dry coating | This grouping combines the immediate verification of the structural work (weld integrity measurement) with the necessary protective finishing steps (coating application and curing/drying). These steps are required to finalize the physical and protective properties of the component before final release. |
| **4. Final Inspection & Release** | Visual check | This represents the final human- or automated-based assessment that determines if the finished product meets all aesthetic and functional criteria before being moved to the next stage (e.g., packaging or delivery). It acts as the final gate in this segment of the process. |

### Application of Grouping (Mapping the Sample Log)

Applying the defined rules to the sample log demonstrates how the low-level events are aggregated:

#### Case A1 Aggregated Log

| CaseID | Timestamp (Start) | Timestamp (End) | High-Level Activity | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A1 | 2024-03-01 08:00:05 | 2024-03-01 08:00:20 | **1. Material Intake & Setup** | 15s |
| A1 | 2024-03-01 08:01:00 | 2024-03-01 08:01:10 | **2. Core Assembly (Welding)** | 10s |
| A1 | 2024-03-01 08:01:20 | 2024-03-01 08:01:45 | **3. Initial Quality Check & Surface Treatment** | 25s |
| A1 | 2024-03-01 08:02:00 | 2024-03-01 08:02:00 | **4. Final Inspection & Release** | 0s |

#### Case B2 Aggregated Log

| CaseID | Timestamp (Start) | Timestamp (End) | High-Level Activity | Duration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| B2 | 2024-03-01 08:00:05 | 2024-03-01 08:00:25 | **1. Material Intake & Setup** | 20s |
| B2 | 2024-03-01 08:01:03 | 2024-03-01 08:01:12 | **2. Core Assembly (Welding)** | 9s |
| B2 | 2024-03-01 08:01:22 | 2024-03-01 08:01:50 | **3. Initial Quality Check & Surface Treatment** | 28s |
| B2 | 2024-03-01 08:02:05 | 2024-03-01 08:02:05 | **4. Final Inspection & Release** | 0s |

### Conclusion

By aggregating the 12 distinct low-level activities into 4 high-level process steps, the complexity of the event log is significantly reduced, moving from micro-level machine details to macro-level process stages. This aggregated view allows process analysts to focus on throughput, bottlenecks, and efficiency at the stage level (e.g., how long does the average **Core Assembly** take?), rather than being overwhelmed by individual component actions.
