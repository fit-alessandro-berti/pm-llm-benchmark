To construct a temporal profile for the global supply chain process, we need to consider the average and standard deviation of the times between various pairs of activities. Here's a representative subset of the activity pairs and their estimated average times and standard deviations:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (1200, 600),  # Average time between Supplier Selection and Order Placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (2400, 1200),  # Average time between Order Placement and Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (1800, 900),   # Average time between Receive Components and Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (1440, 720),   # Average time between Quality Inspection and Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (1080, 540),   # Average time between Component Assembly and Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (900, 450),    # Average time between Product Testing and Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (720, 360),    # Average time between Packaging and Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (480, 240),    # Average time between Warehouse Storage and Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (360, 180)     # Average time between Distribution and After-Sales Support
}
```

This dictionary provides a snapshot of the temporal relationships between various activities in the supply chain process. Each key is a tuple representing a pair of activities, and the value is a tuple containing the estimated average time and standard deviation for the time between those activities.
