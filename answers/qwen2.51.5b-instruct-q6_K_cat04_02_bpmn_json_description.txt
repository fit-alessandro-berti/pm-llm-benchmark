In the provided BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) file, there is a flow of events that starts at an initial activity "Create Order" which branches out into several subprocesses. Each subroutine will have its own set of actions or sequences related to different parts of creating or processing an order. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Activity**:
   - The process starts with the creation of an order.
  
2. **Subprocess 1: Create Customer Details**:
   - Processes in this scenario will involve creating customer ID, name, address, and contact information specific to each new order.

3. **Subprocess 2: Product Selection**:
   - This subprocess involves selecting appropriate products for the created order based on predefined criteria or user input.
  
4. **Subprocess 3: Order Processing**:
   - In this sequence of events, once products are selected, an order is processed (likely meaning placing it in inventory), and possibly shipping details are noted.
  
5. **Subprocess 4: Product Tracking Updates**:
   - Upon completion or failure to fulfill the order according to conditions like late delivery or product shortage during manufacturing process, tracking information about specific items will be updated and reported.

6. **Final Activity**: 
   - The end point is a verification node with no outgoing links, meaning it represents an activity that doesn't branch further after this check and might close the case without moving on to create another order.

**Diagram Explanation:**

- The diagram shows flows of activities (SequenceFlows) from one subprocess to another.
  - **32F24C95-E993-4D5A-91B8-7455E8B44A55 -> 6B044BFB-9D4D-407B-B367-51B7EBB8F8F6** is the main starting point.
- **2D1B8919-8079-448E-BC69-5B221F27C793 -> 1EAEE740-44AA-46AA-8FED-02111C03184E** is where the creation of a new order may terminate, indicating that even if one route does not successfully run as intended (failed Order Processing or similar), it can return back.

This process demonstrates a sequential approach to processing customer orders and updating relevant data about each step for accuracy in inventory management.
