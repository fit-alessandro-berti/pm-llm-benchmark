## Bias Analysis of Event Logs: Protected vs Unprotected Groups

**Analysis:**

The event logs clearly demonstrate a bias favoring the "Unprotected Group" (Group B) over the "Protected Group" (Group A). This bias is primarily driven by the influence of the **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** attributes, along with the **Score Adjustment** column.

**Bias Manifestation:**

1. **LocalResident:** The Protected Group (Group A) consistently has a "FALSE" value for LocalResident, indicating non-local residents. In contrast, the Unprotected Group (Group B) frequently has "TRUE" values, meaning local residents receive different treatment based on residency status. This bias can be systemic if local residents are perceived as more favorable by the system, leading to higher scores and approvals.

2. **CommunityGroup:** The CommunityGroup column reveals a clear pattern: the Unprotected Group (Group B) benefits from community affiliations. "Highland Civic Darts Club" consistently results in positive score adjustments (e.g., +10 points) in both preliminary scoring and manual review, boosting their final scores. This suggests that being associated with a specific community group may provide an advantage, even without explicitly stated criteria for such adjustments.

3. **Score Adjustment:** The Score Adjustment column plays a crucial role in the bias. Group A generally receives no score adjustments (+0), while Group B often experiences positive adjustments (e.g., +10) related to community affiliation and potentially other factors not clearly defined. This direct manipulation of scores directly contributes to the overall disparity in final decisions.

**Potential Impact:**

This bias could lead to unfair outcomes for non-local residents or individuals associated with underrepresented communities. The system may inadvertently favor those with local connections or belonging to specific community groups, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.

**Recommendations:**

* **Transparency:** Clearly define the criteria and weights assigned to LocalResident, CommunityGroup, and Score Adjustment columns to ensure fairness and transparency.
* **Audit and Review:** Regularly audit the system's decisions to identify and address any biases based on these attributes.
* **Diverse Representation:** Ensure that decision-making processes include diverse perspectives from various communities to mitigate potential biases.
