Targeted, open-ended follow-up questions:

Intake & Documentation  
1. How does the property coordinator initially receive and log a new landlord inquiry, and what information is captured at that very first touchpoint?  
2. What specific criteria or checklist do coordinators use to validate that deeds, compliance certificates, and inspections are up-to-date?  
3. When documentation is incomplete, how do you track outstanding items and ensure timely follow-up with the landlord?  
4. Are there service-level targets (e.g., number of business days) for completing the documentation review, and how are delays escalated?

Property Details & Data Entry  
5. Who has authority to enter or edit property attributes in the central database, and how is data accuracy verified before it is considered “final”?  
6. What level of detail is captured about amenities or unique features, and how do you standardize those descriptions across regions?

Assignment of a Property Manager  
7. How do you measure a property manager’s current workload, and what thresholds trigger rebalancing or reassignment?  
8. Which factors carry the most weight—geographic proximity, experience, landlord profile, or something else—and how are trade-offs handled when criteria conflict?  
9. If no manager meets the preferred criteria, what contingency plans are in place?

Kick-off Meeting with the Landlord  
10. What agenda or template guides the initial call/meeting, and how are action items documented and distributed afterward?  
11. How do you handle disagreements at this stage—such as pets vs. no-pets policies or custom lease clauses—before moving forward?

Photography, Inspection, and Repairs  
12. How are photographers and inspectors sourced and scheduled, especially for properties in remote locations?  
13. What is the typical turnaround time from inspection completion to issue resolution, and how do you prioritize multiple repair tasks?  
14. Who bears the cost of repairs, and how is that negotiated or documented with the landlord?

Marketing & Pricing  
15. Which internal teams sign off on the final rental price, and what data inputs (e.g., market comps, seasonality) influence that decision?  
16. How do you decide when a listing is “market-ready,” and what quality checks occur before activation on the rental portal?

Tenant Screening & Lease Negotiation  
17. What screening criteria are non-negotiable versus flexible, and who can grant exceptions?  
18. How do you handle situations with equally qualified applicants—does the landlord have final say, or is there a company policy?  
19. When promotional discounts are offered, who approves them and how are they tracked for ROI?

Quality Checks & Internal Audits  
20. How often do compliance officers sample or review leases, and what happens if they detect a violation?  
21. What financial metrics (e.g., target yield, payback period) must a new property meet before full go-live?  
22. How does the IT team confirm that listing data is correctly synced across all systems, and what monitoring exists post-activation?

Exception & Escalation Handling  
23. Can you describe a recent example of a property requiring special insurance or custom lease clauses, and how that was managed?  
24. What formal escalation paths exist when milestones are missed or stakeholders disagree?  
25. How do you document and learn from exceptions to improve the standard process?

Timing, Sequencing & Dependencies  
26. On average, how long does each major phase take—from initial inquiry to first tenant move-in—and which steps most commonly cause bottlenecks?  
27. Are any tasks allowed to run in parallel (e.g., marketing prep while repairs are still underway), and how do you manage dependencies?  
28. What triggers the official handoff from onboarding to ongoing property management?

Roles, Responsibilities & Communication  
29. How are responsibilities divided among regional offices, property coordinators, managers, and support teams to avoid overlap or gaps?  
30. What communication tools (email, CRM, PM software) are considered the single source of truth, and how is information redundancy minimized?  
31. How are landlords kept informed during onboarding—scheduled updates, dashboards, or ad-hoc communication?

Metrics & Continuous Improvement  
32. Which KPIs do you track to judge onboarding success (e.g., time-to-market, tenant satisfaction, landlord retention), and how are they reported?  
33. How often do you review the onboarding workflow for process improvements, and who drives those initiatives?  
34. If new regulations emerge (e.g., local rent caps, safety standards), how is the onboarding process updated and communicated to staff?

Post-Onboarding Feedback  
35. After the first tenant has moved in, do you conduct any retrospective with the landlord or internal team to capture lessons learned?  
36. How is feedback from tenants during their initial occupancy fed back into refining the onboarding process?

By exploring these areas, we can clarify decision points, responsibilities, timing, and exception management within your end-to-end property onboarding workflow.
