We are given an event log for 5 cases (tickets 101 to 105). The task is to:
1. Identify cases with significantly longer total resolution times.
2. Determine potential root causes of the performance issues.
3. Explain how these factors lead to increased cycle times and propose insights or recommendations.

First, we need to calculate the total resolution time for each case. The resolution time is the time from "Receive Ticket" to "Resolve Ticket". Note that the last event is "Close Ticket", but the resolution happens at "Resolve Ticket". So we will measure from the first event (Receive Ticket) to the event "Resolve Ticket".

However, note that the problem says: "the first event of each ticket marks when the ticket was received, and the last event marks the closure of the ticket." But for resolution time, we are interested in the time until the ticket is resolved (which is the "Resolve Ticket" activity). The closing is a subsequent step.

So for each case, we will:
- Find the timestamp of the first event (Receive Ticket)
- Find the timestamp of the "Resolve Ticket" event
- Calculate the difference in time (in hours or days) between these two.

Let's extract the events for each case:

Case 101:
  Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:00
  Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:00
  Resolution time: 2 hours.

Case 102:
  Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05
  Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:00
  Resolution time: From 08:05 on 2024-03-01 to 09:00 on 2024-03-02 -> 25 hours (since 24 hours from 08:05 to 08:05 next day, then 1 hour to 09:00 -> 25 hours).

Case 103:
  Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:10
  Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:15
  Resolution time: 1 hour 5 minutes (approx 1.083 hours).

Case 104:
  Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20
  Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:00
  Resolution time: From 08:20 on 2024-03-01 to 08:00 on 2024-03-02 -> 23 hours 40 minutes (approx 23.67 hours).

Case 105:
  Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25
  Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:00
  Resolution time: From 08:25 on 2024-03-01 to 09:00 on 2024-03-03 -> 
      Day1: 08:25 to 24:00 -> 15h35m
      Day2: 24 hours
      Day3: 00:00 to 09:00 -> 9 hours
      Total: 15h35m + 24h + 9h = 48h35m (approx 48.58 hours).

Now, let's list the resolution times in hours:

Case 101: 2 hours
Case 102: 25 hours
Case 103: ~1.08 hours
Case 104: ~23.67 hours
Case 105: ~48.58 hours

We can see that Cases 102, 104, and 105 are taking much longer than the average. The average resolution time is (2 + 25 + 1.08 + 23.67 + 48.58) / 5 = 100.33 / 5 = 20.066 hours. So Cases 102, 104, and 105 are above average, but we are looking for "significantly longer". 

Looking at the distribution, Cases 101 and 103 are very quick (around 1-2 hours). Cases 102, 104, and 105 are taking 25, 24, and 48 hours respectively. So all three are significantly longer.

But note: Case 105 is the longest, then Case 102, then Case 104.

Now, we need to determine potential root causes. We are to consider:
- Presence of escalations
- Long waiting times between activities
- Unnecessary delays before investigation and resolution steps.

Let's break down each case:

Case 101:
  Activities: 
    08:00: Receive
    08:10: Triage (10 min wait)
    08:20: Assign to Level-1 (10 min wait)
    09:00: Investigate (40 min wait) -> then immediately resolved at 10:00 (1 hour investigation)
  No escalation. Total time: 2 hours.

Case 102:
  Activities:
    08:05: Receive
    08:30: Triage (25 min wait)
    09:00: Assign to Level-1 (30 min wait)
    11:30: Escalate to Level-2 (2.5 hours wait) -> note: after assignment, they waited 2.5 hours before escalating?
    14:00: Investigate (2.5 hours wait after escalation) -> then resolved next day at 09:00 (which is 19 hours after investigation started? Actually, the investigation started at 14:00 on day1 and then resolved at 09:00 on day2 -> 19 hours later? But note: the investigation step is done by Level-2 agent and it took from 14:00 day1 to 09:00 day2? That seems like a long investigation time? Or is there a wait? Actually, the log shows:
        2024-03-01 14:00: Investigate Issue
        2024-03-02 09:00: Resolve Ticket
    So the investigation step started at 14:00 on day1 and ended at 09:00 on day2? That is 19 hours? But note: the investigation step might be active during non-working hours? However, we don't have information about working hours. We must assume 24/7? Or maybe the process stops at night? The problem does not specify. We will assume continuous time.

    However, note that the escalation happened at 11:30 and then the investigation started at 14:00 the same day (so 2.5 hours wait after escalation). Then the investigation took 19 hours? That seems very long.

    Alternatively, the investigation step might be interrupted? But the log only shows the start of investigation and then the resolution. So we don't know if there were other activities in between? But the log is as provided.

    So for Case 102, we have:
        - Escalation to Level-2
        - Long wait after escalation (2.5 hours) before investigation started
        - Then a very long investigation time (19 hours) from start to resolution? But note: the resolution event is the next day. So the investigation step took 19 hours? Or maybe the agent worked on it intermittently? Without more data, we note the long gap.

Case 103: Quick, no escalation.

Case 104:
  Activities:
    08:20: Receive
    09:00: Triage (40 min wait)
    09:30: Assign to Level-1 (30 min wait)
    13:00: Investigate (3.5 hours wait) -> then resolved next day at 08:00 (which is 19 hours after investigation started? Again, from 13:00 day1 to 08:00 day2 is 19 hours).

    So we have:
        - Long wait before investigation: 3.5 hours after assignment
        - Then a long investigation time: 19 hours

    No escalation.

Case 105:
  Activities:
    08:25: Receive
    08:35: Triage (10 min)
    09:00: Assign to Level-1 (25 min)
    09:10: Investigate (10 min after assignment)
    10:00: Escalate to Level-2 (after 50 minutes of investigation? Or wait? Actually, the investigation started at 09:10 and then at 10:00 they escalated. So they investigated for 50 minutes and then escalated? Maybe they found it too complex? Then:
        2024-03-02 14:00: Investigate Issue (by Level-2 agent? But note: the activity is the same "Investigate Issue". How do we know it's by Level-2? The escalation step is to Level-2, so the next investigation is by Level-2? But the log doesn't explicitly say. However, we can assume that after escalation, the investigation is done by Level-2. Then:
        2024-03-03 09:00: Resolve Ticket (which is 19 hours after the investigation started on day2? From 14:00 day2 to 09:00 day3 is 19 hours? Actually, 14:00 day2 to 14:00 day3 is 24 hours, then 5 hours earlier? So 19 hours?).

    So breakdown:
        - Escalation to Level-2
        - After escalation, there was a long wait: from 10:00 day1 to 14:00 day2 -> 28 hours wait? (from 10:00 to 24:00 is 14 hours, then 14:00 next day is 14 hours? Actually, 10:00 day1 to 10:00 day2 is 24 hours, then 4 more hours to 14:00 -> 28 hours) before the Level-2 agent started investigation.
        - Then the investigation took 19 hours (from 14:00 day2 to 09:00 day3).

    So total resolution time: 48.58 hours.

Now, let's identify patterns:

1. Escalations: Cases 102, 105 had escalations. Case 104 did not. But Case 104 also had a long resolution time. So escalation is a factor but not the only one.

2. Long waiting times:
   - Case 102: 
        After assignment: 2.5 hours wait before escalation.
        After escalation: 2.5 hours wait before investigation started.
        Then investigation took 19 hours? (or was there a wait? The log doesn't show any event in between, so we assume the investigation step took 19 hours? Or maybe the agent started and then paused? Without more data, we note the long gap from the start of investigation to resolution.)

   - Case 104:
        After assignment: 3.5 hours wait before investigation started.
        Then investigation took 19 hours? (from 13:00 day1 to 08:00 day2).

   - Case 105:
        After escalation: 28 hours wait before the Level-2 agent started investigation.
        Then investigation took 19 hours.

3. Unnecessary delays: 
   - In Case 102, why did they wait 2.5 hours after assignment to escalate? 
   - In Case 104, why did they wait 3.5 hours after assignment to start investigation?
   - In Case 105, why did they wait 28 hours after escalation to start the investigation by Level-2?

Also note that in Cases 102, 104, and 105, the investigation step itself took a long time (19 hours). This might indicate that the issue was complex, but also note that in Case 101 and 103, the investigation was done by Level-1 and took 1 hour (Case 101: from 09:00 to 10:00) and 30 minutes (Case 103: from 08:45 to 09:15). So the Level-1 agents were able to resolve without escalation in a short time.

Potential root causes:

- Escalations: Cases that escalate take longer. But note that escalation might be necessary for complex issues. However, the process after escalation seems to have long delays (waiting for Level-2 agent to start) and then long investigation times.

- Resource unavailability: 
    - In Case 102: After escalation, the Level-2 agent started investigation only after 2.5 hours? That might be because the Level-2 agent was busy? 
    - In Case 105: The Level-2 agent started investigation after 28 hours? That is a very long wait. It could be that the Level-2 agent was not available or the ticket was not prioritized.

- Long investigation times: The investigation step in the delayed cases took 19 hours. This could be due to the complexity of the issue, but also might be because the agent did not work on it continuously? Or the issue required more research? However, without more data, we note that the investigation step in the quick cases was short.

- Delays between steps: There are significant waiting times between activities. For example, in Case 104, after assignment, they waited 3.5 hours before starting investigation. Why? Maybe the agent was busy with other tickets? Or the customer did not provide enough information? But the log doesn't show any such activity.

Proposed insights and recommendations:

1. Escalation handling: 
   - The process after escalation seems to have long delays. We should ensure that when a ticket is escalated, it is immediately assigned to an available Level-2 agent. In Case 105, the wait was 28 hours. This is unacceptable. We need to set a service level agreement (SLA) for escalation response time.

2. Resource allocation: 
   - The long waits might be due to unavailability of agents. We should monitor the workload of agents and ensure that there is enough coverage, especially for Level-2 agents who are specialized. Maybe we need more Level-2 agents or better distribution of tickets.

3. Investigation time: 
   - The long investigation times (19 hours) might be due to complex issues, but also might be due to inefficiencies. We should analyze what kind of issues take so long. It could be that the agents are waiting for information from the customer or other teams. We might need to set time limits for investigation steps or provide better tools for agents.

4. Process optimization: 
   - In Case 104, there was a 3.5-hour wait after assignment before investigation. This might be because the assigned agent was not available or the ticket was not picked up promptly. We should ensure that once a ticket is assigned, the agent starts working on it immediately. We might set a timer for the agent to start.

5. Monitoring and alerts: 
   - We should monitor the time between steps and set alerts if a ticket is waiting too long at any step. For example, if a ticket is assigned and the agent hasn't started investigation within 30 minutes, an alert should be triggered.

6. Training and tools: 
   - The long investigation times might be reduced by better training of Level-1 agents so that they can handle more complex issues without escalation. Also, providing better knowledge base or tools might help agents resolve issues faster.

Conclusion:

The cases with significantly longer resolution times are 102 (25 hours), 104 (24 hours), and 105 (49 hours). The main factors are:
   - Escalations (in Cases 102 and 105) and the subsequent long delays in starting investigation by Level-2 agents.
   - Long waiting times between activities (especially after assignment and after escalation).
   - Long investigation times (19 hours) in the delayed cases.

Recommendations focus on improving the escalation process, ensuring resource availability, reducing waiting times, and improving investigation efficiency.

### Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

#### 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times
**Total resolution time** is calculated as the duration from "Receive Ticket" to "Resolve Ticket". The results are:

| Case ID | Resolution Time | Notes                                  |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 101     | 2 hours         | Quick resolution, no escalation        |
| 102     | **25 hours**    | Escalation to Level-2; long delays     |
| 103     | 1.08 hours      | Quick resolution, no escalation        |
| 104     | **23.67 hours** | No escalation; long investigation lag |
| 105     | **48.58 hours** | Escalation; extreme delays in Level-2  |

**Cases 102, 104, and 105** exhibit significantly longer resolution times (23.67–48.58 hours) compared to the average (20.07 hours) and the efficient cases (1.08–2 hours). Case 105 is exceptionally slow (48.58 hours).

#### 2. Root Causes of Performance Issues
Key factors causing delays:

| Case ID | Root Cause                                                                 | Supporting Evidence from Event Log |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **102** | **Escalation delays** + **long investigation lag**                         | - 2.5-hour wait before escalation after assignment.<br>- 19-hour investigation phase (14:00 day1  09:00 day2). |
| **104** | **Excessive wait before investigation**                                    | - 3.5-hour wait after assignment (09:30  13:00).<br>- 19-hour investigation phase (13:00 day1  08:00 day2). |
| **105** | **Escalation bottlenecks** + **extreme Level-2 inactivity**                | - 28-hour gap after escalation (10:00 day1  14:00 day2).<br>- 19-hour investigation (14:00 day2  09:00 day3). |

**Common Patterns Across Delayed Cases:**
- **Escalations (Cases 102, 105):**  
  Delays occur post-escalation due to:
  - Unavailability of Level-2 agents (e.g., 28-hour gap in Case 105).
  - Inefficient handoffs (e.g., 2.5-hour wait before escalation in Case 102).
- **Long Investigation Lags (All delayed cases):**  
  Investigation phases span 19+ hours, suggesting:
  - Resource constraints (agents overwhelmed or unavailable).
  - Complex issues requiring prolonged effort.
- **Inactivity Gaps (Cases 102, 104, 105):**  
  Idle time between activities (e.g., 3.5-hour wait in Case 104 after assignment) indicates:
  - Poor workload balancing.
  - Lack of proactive monitoring for stalled tickets.

---

#### 3. How Factors Increase Cycle Times & Recommendations
**Impact of Identified Factors:**
- **Escalation Delays:**  
  Manual handoffs and unavailability of specialized agents add 10–28+ hours.
- **Investigation Lags:**  
  Extended investigation phases (19+ hours) dominate resolution time, often due to agent unavailability or complex issues.
- **Inactivity Gaps:**  
  Idle periods between steps (e.g., assignment  investigation) waste hours, compounding delays.

**Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks:**
1. **Optimize Escalation Workflow:**  
   - Implement automated escalation routing to available Level-2 agents.  
   - Set SLAs for Level-2 response time (e.g., 1 hour).  
   *Impact:* Reduces handoff delays (e.g., Case 105’s 28-hour gap).

2. **Improve Resource Allocation:**  
   - Use workload dashboards to balance ticket distribution.  
   - Hire/train more Level-2 agents to handle complex cases faster.  
   *Impact:* Cuts investigation lags (e.g., Case 104’s 19-hour investigation).

3. **Proactive Ticket Monitoring:**  
   - Flag tickets idle >1 hour (e.g., after assignment) for agent follow-up.  
   - Automate reminders for stalled cases.  
   *Impact:* Eliminates unnecessary waits (e.g., Case 104’s 3.5-hour gap).

4. **Enhance Agent Tools & Training:**  
   - Provide Level-1 agents with better troubleshooting guides to reduce escalations.  
   - Offer Level-2 agents access to advanced diagnostics to shorten investigation.  
   *Impact:* Reduces need for escalations and speeds resolution.

**Expected Outcome:**  
These changes could reduce resolution times by 50–70% for delayed cases, bringing them closer to the 1–2 hour benchmark of efficient cases.
