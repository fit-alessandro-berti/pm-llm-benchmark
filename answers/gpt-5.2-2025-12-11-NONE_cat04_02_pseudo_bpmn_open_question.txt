### 1) Redesign goals and high-level shape
To cut turnaround time and handle non-standard requests more flexibly, redesign around three ideas:

1. **Early classification + risk/complexity scoring (predictive analytics)** to decide *how* the request should flow (straight-through vs assisted vs custom).
2. **Parallelization + automation-by-default** for validations, checks, pricing, and document generation.
3. **Dynamic work allocation** (skill-based routing, load balancing, and SLA-driven escalation) so humans intervene only where needed.

Structurally, replace the single “Standard vs Custom” fork with a **triage subprocess** that computes:
- `RequestTypeConfidence` (probability standard/custom)
- `ComplexityScore` (how hard/custom it will be)
- `RiskScore` (credit/fraud/compliance)
- `SLA urgency`

Then route into **lanes** such as *Straight-through (STP)*, *Assisted Standard*, *Custom Engineering*, or *Exception Handling*.

### 2) Proposed BPMN-level changes by step

#### Start  Task A “Receive Customer Request” (upgrade to intake + normalization)
**Changes**
- Add an **automated “Capture & Normalize Request”** step:
  - Parse email/PDF/forms via OCR/NLP.
  - Validate required fields; auto-enrich customer/account data (CRM/ERP).
- Add a **“Self-service clarification”** micro-loop:
  - If data missing, automatically request clarification from customer with a structured form rather than sending it to an agent.

**Effect**
- Fewer back-and-forth cycles, faster time-to-first-decision, higher data quality.

---

#### New Subprocess: “Intelligent Triage & Pre-Checks” (replaces early XOR “Check Request Type”)
Insert immediately after intake:

1) **Task: “Predict Request Path” (ML scoring)**
- Model outputs:
  - likelihood of customization
  - expected lead time
  - margin risk
  - probability of approval requiring manager sign-off

2) **Task: “Policy & Eligibility Rules Check” (rules engine)**
- Deterministic checks: customer tier, contract terms, product constraints, restricted destinations, etc.

3) **Gateway (XOR or OR): “Select Processing Track”**
Suggested routing:
- **Track 1: STP Standard** (high confidence standard + low risk)
- **Track 2: Assisted Standard** (standard but needs human review due to risk/ambiguity)
- **Track 3: Custom Fast-Path** (likely custom but within known patterns/templates)
- **Track 4: Custom Deep Analysis** (novel or high complexity)
- **Track 5: Reject Early** (policy violation or infeasible constraints detected early)

**Effect**
- Stops treating “custom” as a monolith; many “custom-like” requests can be handled via templates quickly.
- Early rejection reduces wasted downstream effort.

---

#### Standard path: Task B1 “Perform Standard Validation” (automate + make asynchronous)
**Changes**
- Convert to **automated validations** (schema checks, contract price eligibility, shipping constraints).
- If ambiguity remains, open a **“Validation Clarification” user task** but keep everything else queued/ready (do not block other checks).

**Effect**
- Shorter cycle times; humans only resolve exceptions.

---

#### Parallel checks: Gateway (AND) “Run Parallel Checks” (expand and add timeouts)
Current parallel checks are good; improve them:

**Changes**
- Keep **Credit Check** and **Inventory Check** parallel, but:
  - Add **“Supplier/ATP Check”** (available-to-promise) and **“Fraud/Compliance Screen”** where relevant.
  - Make checks **event-driven** (callbacks/webhooks) so process doesn’t idle.
  - Add **timer boundary events**:
    - If inventory check exceeds X minutes, trigger **“Provisional Options”** (alternative warehouse, partial shipment, substitute SKU).
- Add **gateway: “Can proceed with provisional data?”**
  - If yes, continue with provisional delivery estimate and mark “subject to confirmation”.
  - If no, route to exception handling.

**Effect**
- Prevents long stalls; gives customer faster, transparent responses.

---

#### Task D “Calculate Delivery Date” (upgrade to predictive ETA + optimization)
**Changes**
- Replace with **“Predict & Optimize Delivery Commit Date”**:
  - Use historical fulfillment data, carrier performance, seasonality, backlog, and location.
  - Compute *confidence intervals* (e.g., P50/P90 delivery dates).
- Add **gateway: “Delivery SLA met?”**
  - If not met, automatically explore:
    - expedited shipping cost options
    - split shipments
    - alternate fulfillment nodes

**Effect**
- More accurate promises, fewer missed ETAs, better customer trust.

---

#### Custom path: Task B2 “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis” (split into fast vs deep)
**Changes**
- Add a **Custom “Pattern Match” task** first:
  - Map request to known customization templates (pre-approved variants).
- Gateway: “Matches Known Custom Template?”
  - **Yes  “Auto-Feasibility + Auto-Quote”** (fast path)
  - **No  “Engineering Feasibility Subprocess”** (deep path)

**Engineering Feasibility Subprocess**
- Dynamic resource allocation:
  - skill-based routing (materials engineer vs design engineer)
  - WIP limits and load balancing
- Add **collaboration task**: request clarifications from customer early with guided questions.
- Add **timeboxed spike**: if feasibility not resolved within N hours, escalate or propose alternatives.

**Effect**
- Many “custom” requests become near-standard; truly novel work gets structured handling without clogging the system.

---

#### Gateway “Is Customization Feasible?” (add partial feasibility + alternatives)
**Changes**
Replace binary feasibility with more nuanced outcomes:

- **Gateway (XOR): Feasibility Outcome**
  - Feasible as requested
  - Feasible with modifications (propose alternative spec)
  - Not feasible (reject)
  - Requires paid discovery (offer consulting/engineering fee)

**Effect**
- Higher conversion rate and satisfaction by offering options instead of hard rejects.

---

#### Task E1 “Prepare Custom Quotation” (automate configuration/pricing)
**Changes**
- Implement a **CPQ-style quoting** task:
  - automated BOM/config rules
  - margin guardrails
  - recommended price bands based on similar deals
- Generate quote drafts automatically; human approves only exceptions (e.g., margin below threshold).

**Effect**
- Faster quotes; more consistent pricing; fewer rework loops.

---

#### Approval section: Gateway “Is Approval Needed?” (make it predictive and risk-based)
**Changes**
- Instead of a simple rule, use **risk-based approval**:
  - approval triggered by predicted margin erosion, high discount, high risk, SLA breach, customer tier, etc.
- Add **Gateway (XOR): “Auto-approve?”**
  - If within guardrails  auto-approve and log for audit.
  - If not  manager approval.

**Manager Approval (Task F) improvements**
- Provide a **decision cockpit**: recommended action, risk explanation, comparable deals, what-if options.
- Add **timer escalation**: if no decision within X hours, escalate to backup approver.

**Effect**
- Less waiting on approvals; managers spend time only on true exceptions.

---

#### Task H “Re-evaluate Conditions” (replace loop-back with controlled rework and versioning)
Current loop goes back to Task E1 or D, which can create unclear cycles.

**Changes**
- Create a **“Controlled Rework Subprocess”**:
  - Track versioning of quote/commit date.
  - Record reason codes (pricing, capacity, risk).
  - Limit number of rework iterations; after N loops trigger an “Executive Decision” or propose alternatives automatically.
- Add **Gateway: “Can we propose alternative?”** (instead of full redo)
  - Alternative delivery date, partial shipment, modified spec, revised price.

**Effect**
- Prevents endless loops; clearer accountability; faster convergence.

---

#### Task G “Generate Final Invoice” (make it a “Generate Order Pack” automation)
**Changes**
- Expand to **“Generate Final Order Pack”**:
  - invoice + order confirmation + SLA/ETA statement + change policy
  - automatic posting to ERP
- Add **Event Subprocess: “Customer changes request”** (message event)
  - If customer updates after quote, route to “Change Impact Analysis” rather than restarting manually.

**Effect**
- Lower operational friction; better customer experience with clear documentation.

---

#### Task I “Send Confirmation to Customer” (personalize + proactive updates)
**Changes**
- Replace with **“Omnichannel Confirmation + Proactive Notifications”**:
  - customer chooses email/SMS/portal
  - include ETA confidence, options chosen, and next steps
- Add **Event-based gateway** for post-confirmation:
  - shipment delay prediction triggers proactive communication and mitigation offers.

**Effect**
- Higher satisfaction and fewer inbound “status check” contacts.

---

### 3) New gateways/subprocesses to add (summary)
- **Subprocess:** Intelligent Triage & Pre-Checks
- **Gateway:** Select Processing Track (STP / Assisted / Custom Fast / Custom Deep / Reject)
- **Gateway:** Proceed with provisional data? (for slow dependencies)
- **Gateway:** Delivery SLA met? (with optimization alternatives)
- **Gateway:** Matches Known Custom Template?
- **Gateway:** Feasibility Outcome (feasible / feasible-with-mods / discovery / reject)
- **Gateway:** Auto-approve? (guardrails)
- **Subprocess:** Controlled Rework (versioned, timeboxed)
- **Event Subprocess:** Customer change request
- **Event Subprocess:** Predicted delay/exception  proactive mitigation

---

### 4) Impact assessment

**Performance (turnaround time)**
- Big gains from:
  - early triage (right work to right path)
  - automation of validations/quoting/invoicing
  - event-driven parallel checks with timeouts and provisional progression
  - reduced approval bottlenecks via auto-approval within guardrails

**Customer satisfaction**
- Faster initial response and clearer commitments (ETA confidence ranges).
- More “yes, but…” outcomes for custom requests (alternatives) rather than rejections.
- Proactive communication reduces uncertainty and inbound inquiries.

**Operational complexity (trade-offs)**
- Increases upfront complexity:
  - ML models, rules engines, CPQ integration, event-driven orchestration
  - monitoring/model governance (drift, bias, explainability)
- Mitigation:
  - phase rollout (start with rules + simple scoring, then ML)
  - keep “human override” lanes
  - instrument everything (cycle time by path, rework rate, approval latency, prediction accuracy)
