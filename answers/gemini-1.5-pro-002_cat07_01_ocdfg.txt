The visualization depicts a flowchart of an order fulfillment and related processes, likely within an enterprise resource planning (ERP) or similar system. It breaks down the steps involved in various scenarios, including sales orders, purchase orders, purchase requisitions, return orders, and vendor invoices.

Each process starts with a "Start" node and ends with an "End" node. Rectangular boxes represent process steps, and the arrows connecting them show the flow of operations.  The numbers on the arrows indicate the time taken for that specific step (in milliseconds). Each process step box also shows the total number of objects processed and the overall time taken for that step.

Here's a breakdown of the processes visualized:

* **Sales Order:**  Starts with "Create Order," then "Pack Goods," "Ship Goods," "Confirm Delivery," and finally "Close Order." This flow represents the typical lifecycle of a sales order.

* **Purchase Order:** Initiated by "Create Requisition," followed by "Approve Requisition." Once approved, the process seemingly merges with elements of the sales order process, although this visualization doesn't explicitly detail the purchase order fulfillment beyond requisition approval.

* **Purchase Requisition:**  Contained within the purchase order process, involving "Create Requisition" and "Approve Requisition" steps.

* **Return Order:** Starts with "Check Stock" and then goes to "Process Return."  This flow merges with other processes at the "Approve Payment" stage.

* **Vendor Invoice:** Starts with "Send Order," and, similar to return orders, converges at "Approve Payment."

* **Common Steps:** "Approve Payment" and "Create Invoice" seem to be common points of convergence for several processes, suggesting these are shared services or steps that occur regardless of the originating process.

The visualization also provides statistics:

* **Number of Objects:** Each initial rectangle lists the number of objects (presumably transactions or items) handled within that process. For instance, SalesOrderltem has 3.5M objects.
* **Overall Time:** Each process step box shows the overall time spent in that stage, likely accumulated across all objects processed.  For instance, "Create Order" takes 8.5M (milliseconds) overall.
* **Step Time:** The time taken for each individual transition between steps is displayed on the connecting arrows.

The color-coding of the arrows may suggest different departments or systems involved, though there's no key to explain the color scheme. This visualization aims to give an overview of the duration and sequence of operations in this order management system, highlighting potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement based on the time taken at each stage.
