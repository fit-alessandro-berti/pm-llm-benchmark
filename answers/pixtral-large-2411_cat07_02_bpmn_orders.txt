The provided visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that outlines the process flow from receiving a customer's order to the final delivery of a product. The diagram is divided into four main swimlanes, each representing different stages of the process: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. 

Here is a detailed description of each swimlane and the activities within them:

### 1. Sales
- **Start Event:** The process begins every Monday morning.
- **Check order for completeness:** Validates if the order is complete.
- **Check if customer is already in the database:** Determines if the customer's information already exists in the database.
    - **If not, add customer to the database:** If the customer is not found, their details are added to the database.
    - **Send order details:** The order details are then sent to the next stage.
- **Product sent:** Confirmation that the product has been sent.
- **Draft invoice:** An invoice is drafted once the product is sent.

### 2. Production
- **Start Event:** This stage begins when order details arrive.
- **Plan production:** Preparation and planning for the production of the ordered product.
- **Manufacture product:** The actual manufacturing process.
    - If the material is faulty, the process moves to the procurement stage for material compensation.
- **Product complete:** Confirmation that the product has been successfully manufactured.

### 3. Procurement
- **Start Event:** This stage may be triggered if the material is faulty during the production process.
- **Material Compensation Subprocess:**
    - **Order materials:** New materials are ordered.
    - **Return materials:** Faulty materials are returned.
    - **Check materials:** The materials are checked upon arrival.
        - If the materials are not satisfactory, the order can be canceled, and the process might loop or return to a previous stage.

### 4. Warehouse
- **Start Event:** The process begins once the product is complete.
- **Send product:** The product is sent to the customer.
- **Product sent:** Confirmation that the product has been dispatched.

### Connections and Interactions
- **Interactions between stages:**
    - There is a back-and-forth interaction between Production and Procurement if materials are faulty.
    - Order details are passed from Sales to Production.
    - The completed product is sent from Production to Warehouse.
    - Confirmation of product dispatch from Warehouse triggers the drafting of the invoice in Sales.

This BPMN diagram effectively illustrates the flow of activities, decision points, and interactions between different departments involved in fulfilling a customer's order.
