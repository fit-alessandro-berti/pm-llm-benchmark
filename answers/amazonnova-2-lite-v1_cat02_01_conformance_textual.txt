### **Analysis of Deviations from Normative Process**

---

## **Overview of Normative Process Flow**

Based on the **normative process description**, the correct sequences are:

### **Sufficient Inventory Scenario:**
1. **Receive order**
2. **Check inventory**
3. **Authorize payment**
4. **Package items**
5. **Ship order**
6. **Close order**

### **Insufficient Inventory Scenario:**
1. **Receive order**
2. **Check inventory**
3. **Cancel order**
4. **Close order**

---

## **Key Constraints Recap:**

- **“Check inventory”** must occur **after “Receive order”** and **before** any decisions about payment or fulfillment.
- **“Authorize payment”** must occur **after “Check inventory”** and **before “Package items.”**
- **“Package items”** must occur **after “Authorize payment”** and **before “Ship order.”**
- **“Ship order”** must **never occur after “Cancel order.”**
- **“Close order”** must be the **final** activity in **all** cases.
- Any activity from the fulfillment path (e.g., **Authorize payment**, **Package items**, **Ship order**) **must not occur after a cancellation.**

## **Case-by-Case Evaluation**

---

### **Case 1:**

**Sequence:**
1. Receive order  
2. Check inventory  
3. Authorize payment  
4. Package items  
5. Ship order  
6. Close order  

 **Valid.**  
- Follows the exact normative flow for sufficient inventory.
- All constraints are respected:  
  - `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  
  - Ends with `Close order`.

**Conclusion:**  **No violation.**

---

### **Case 2:**

**Sequence:**
1. Receive order  
2. Check inventory  
3. **Package items**  
4. **Authorize payment**  
5. Ship order  
6. Close order  

 **Violation(s):**

- **Problem 1:** `"Package items"` occurs **before** `"Authorize payment"`.  
  - **Constraint violated:**  
    > _“Package items” should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped._  
    This case reverses the correct order: packaging happens **before** payment is authorized, which is illogical and violates the normative process.

- **Problem 2:** While the sequence continues to `Ship order` and `Close order`, the **sequence is invalid** due to the incorrect ordering of `Package items` and `Authorize payment`.

**Conclusion:**  **Violation detected** — Incorrect ordering of `Authorize payment` and `Package items`.

---

### **Case 3:**

**Sequence:**
1. Receive order  
2. Check inventory  
3. Authorize payment  
4. Cancel order  
5. **Ship order**  
6. Close order  

 **Violation(s):**

- **Problem 1:** `"Ship order"` occurs **after** `"Cancel order"`.  
  - **Constraint violated:**  
    > _“Ship order” should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation._  
    Once an order is canceled, **no fulfillment activities** (like shipping) should occur.

- **Problem 2:** `"Authorize payment"` occurred **before** cancellation. This may be questionable, but **not necessarily invalid**.  
  - The normative process does not **explicitly forbid** authorizing payment before cancellation, **but it does imply** that once cancellation occurs, fulfillment should stop.  
  - However, authorizing payment **may** be an administrative step to refund or verify payment, depending on interpretation.  
  - **But** since **shipping follows cancellation**, this **clearly violates the normative logic**.

**Conclusion:**  **Violation detected** — Shipping after cancellation is invalid.

---

### **Case 4:**

**Sequence:**
1. Receive order  
2. Check inventory  
3. Cancel order  
4. Close order  

 **Valid.**  
- Follows the normative cancellation path:  
  `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order`  
- No fulfillment activities occur after cancellation.

**Conclusion:**  **No violation.**

---

### **Case 5:**

**Sequence:**
1. Receive order  
2. Check inventory  
3. Authorize payment  
4. Ship order  
5. Close order  

 **Violation(s):**

- **Problem:** Missing **`Package items`** step.  
  - **Constraint violated:**  
    > _“Package items” should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped._  
    In this case, **`Ship order`** occurs **directly after `Authorize payment`**, skipping **`Package items`**, which contradicts the normative sequence.

- **Additional issue:**  
  Even if packaging was implied or assumed to have occurred off-log, the **recorded trace** must reflect the normative sequence. Since `Package items` is missing from the trace, **the log does not conform** to the normative model.

**Conclusion:**  **Violation detected** — Missing required `Package items` step before shipping.

## **Summary of Deviations**

| Case ID | Violation(s)                                                                 | Status   |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1       | None                                                                         |  Valid |
| 2       | `Package items` occurs before `Authorize payment`                            |  Invalid |
| 3       | `Ship order` occurs after `Cancel order`                                     |  Invalid |
| 4       | None                                                                         |  Valid |
| 5       | Missing required `Package items` before `Ship order`                         |  Invalid |

## **Conclusion**

**Cases 2, 3, and 5** violate the normative process:

- **Case 2** reverses the required order of `Authorize payment` and `Package items`.
- **Case 3** attempts to ship after an order has been canceled, which is illogical and invalid.
- **Case 5** skips the required `Package items` activity before shipping.

These violations contradict the normative flow described in the process guidelines, which require strict sequencing of activities based on inventory availability and logical dependencies between steps.
