This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process of handling a credit scoring request between a bank and a scoring service.

### Swimlanes:
- The process is divided into two main swimlanes: "Credit Scoring (Bank)" and "Scoring Service."

### Key Components:

1. **Credit Scoring (Bank):**
   - **Start Event:** The process begins with the receipt of a scoring request.
   - **Request Credit Score:** The bank requests a credit score from the external scoring service.
   - **Event-based Gateway:** The process waits for a response which could be either delay information or a credit score.
   - **Report Delay:** If delay information is received, the bank processes this delay.
   - **Receive Credit Score:** Once the credit score is received, it proceeds to send the credit score.
   - **Send Credit Score:** The credit score is sent back, completing the process.
   - **End Event:** Scoring request is marked as handled.

2. **Scoring Service:**
   - **Start Event:** The process begins with the receipt of a scoring request.
   - **Compute Credit Score (Level 1):** The scoring service computes the credit score initially.
   - **Exclusive Gateway (Score Available?):** Checks if the score is available.
   - **Yes Path:** If the score is available, it's sent to the bank.
   - **No Path:** If the score isn't available, a delay is reported, and a second computation is triggered (level 2).
   - **Send Credit Score:** Sends the computed credit score back to the bank.
   - **End Event:** Marks the request handling as complete.

### Other Elements:
- **Messages and Communication:** The diagram shows message flows (dashed lines) between the bank and the scoring service for sending/receiving requests and reports.

Overall, this BPMN diagram details the interaction between a bank and a scoring service to process credit score requests, including how delays and multiple computation levels are handled.
