### Step 1: Identify Recurring Activities and Contextual Differences

From the event log, the following activities appear multiple times **within the same case** and carry different meanings depending on context:

- **`Verify Documents`** — Appears twice in C001 and C003.
  - In C001: First verification fails due to missing docs; second occurs after customer uploads missing ID.
  - In C003: First is initial physical ID check; second is re-verification after internal account adjustment.
   *Meaning changes based on whether it’s initial verification or re-verification after correction.*

- **`Call Customer`** — Appears twice in C002 and once in C003 (but only C002 has two calls).
  - In C002: First call is to clarify discrepancy; second is to confirm resolution.
   *Meaning changes based on intent: investigative vs. confirmatory.*

> Note: Although `Call Customer` appears in C001 and C003, it only recurs *within the same case* in C002. We will focus on renaming only those that recur *within a single case* to avoid overcomplicating names for single-occurrence events.

### Step 2: Renamed Activities Based on Context

| Original Activity     | New Name (Contextual)           | Justification |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| `Verify Documents` (first occurrence) | `Initial Document Verification` | First check, often incomplete or triggering follow-up. |
| `Verify Documents` (second occurrence) | `Re-verify Documents After Update` | Occurs after customer or system update; confirms resolution. |
| `Call Customer` (first in C002) | `Call to Clarify Issue` | Purpose is to gather missing info or resolve ambiguity. |
| `Call Customer` (second in C002) | `Call to Confirm Resolution` | Purpose is to validate that corrective action was understood/accepted. |

> Note: We do not rename `Call Customer` in C001 or C003 because they occur only once per case and their context is clear from the log (e.g., “request missing docs” or “customer stepped out”). Renaming is only applied where ambiguity arises from recurrence.

### Step 4: Justification of Naming Choices

- **`Initial Document Verification` vs `Re-verify Documents After Update`**  
  The first verification is often the trigger for follow-up actions (e.g., requesting more docs or adjusting accounts). The second occurs after a change — either customer-supplied documents or internal system updates — and serves as a quality gate before approval. The new names reflect this causal relationship and prevent ambiguity in process mining or auditing.

- **`Call to Clarify Issue` vs `Call to Confirm Resolution`**  
  In C002, the first call is investigative — seeking to understand a discrepancy. The second is confirmatory — ensuring the customer is satisfied with the fix. These are fundamentally different intents, and renaming them supports better process analytics (e.g., measuring time-to-clarify vs time-to-confirm).

- **No renaming for single-instance `Call Customer` in C001/C003**  
  Since these calls occur only once per case and their context is clearly described in the “Additional Context” column, renaming them would add unnecessary verbosity without improving clarity.

### Summary

The revised log now clearly distinguishes between semantically different instances of the same activity name by incorporating contextual cues into the activity labels. This improves traceability, supports accurate process modeling, and enables better performance analysis (e.g., measuring rework loops or confirmation cycles). The naming is grounded in event order, resource behavior, and explicit context from the log.
