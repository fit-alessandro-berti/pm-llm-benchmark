### Analysis and Renaming of Activities

Upon reviewing the event log, three activities appear multiple times **within the same case** and exhibit **contextual differences**:

1. **`Verify Documents`**  
   - Occurs early in the process (initial verification) and later (re-verification after corrections or additional submissions).  
   - **Contextual difference**: First instance = *initial validation*; second instance = *re-validation after changes or new info*.  
   - **Renaming**:  
     - **`Verify Documents (Initial)`** for the first occurrence.  
     - **`Verify Documents (Re-verification)`** for the second occurrence.

2. **`Call Customer`**  
   - In C001: Call to **request missing documents**.  
   - In C002: First call to **clarify discrepancy**, second call to **confirm adjustments**.  
   - In C003: Call to **ask customer to return to branch**.  
   - **Contextual difference**: Purpose varies—*information request*, *clarification*, *confirmation*, or *logistical coordination*.  
   - However, across all cases, the **first call** is **proactive outreach to resolve an issue** (missing info, discrepancy, or customer absence), while the **second call** (in C002) is a **confirmation/follow-up**.  
   - **Renaming**:  
     - **`Call Customer (Request Info/Clarify)`** for calls seeking input or resolving gaps.  
     - **`Call Customer (Confirm Resolution)`** for follow-up calls verifying actions taken.

3. **`Adjust Account`**  
   - Appears only once per case, but **not repeated within a case**, so **no renaming needed**.  
   - (Note: Only `Verify Documents` and `Call Customer` recur within individual cases.)

>  **Only `Verify Documents` and `Call Customer` require renaming** to reflect intra-case contextual shifts.

### Justification of Renaming Choices

1. **`Verify Documents (Initial)` vs. `Verify Documents (Re-verification)`**  
   - The **first verification** always occurs right after request initiation and represents the **baseline check**.  
   - The **second verification** follows either a customer submission (`Submit Additional`) or an internal correction (`Adjust Account`), indicating a **validation of updated or corrected information**.  
   - The "Additional Context" column explicitly states “re-checks” or “after adjustment,” confirming the re-verification intent.

2. **`Call Customer (Request Info/Clarify)` vs. `Call Customer (Confirm Resolution)`**  
   - In **C001 and C003**, the call aims to **obtain missing input** (docs or physical presence)—classified as *requesting info or clarifying*.  
   - In **C002**, the **first call** seeks to **clarify a discrepancy** (still fits "Request Info/Clarify"), while the **second call** occurs **after an action** (`Adjust Account`) and **confirms the fix**—hence "Confirm Resolution".  
   - This distinction aligns with process semantics: **pre-action outreach** vs. **post-action validation**.
