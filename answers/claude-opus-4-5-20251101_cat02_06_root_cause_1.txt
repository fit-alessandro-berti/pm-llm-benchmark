# Customer Support Ticket Resolution Analysis

## 1. Case Duration Analysis

Let me first calculate the total resolution time for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | Status |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| 101 | 2024-03-01 08:00 | 2024-03-01 10:15 | **2h 15min** |  Fast |
| 102 | 2024-03-01 08:05 | 2024-03-02 09:15 | **25h 10min** |  Slow |
| 103 | 2024-03-01 08:10 | 2024-03-01 09:30 | **1h 20min** |  Fast |
| 104 | 2024-03-01 08:20 | 2024-03-02 08:30 | **24h 10min** |  Slow |
| 105 | 2024-03-01 08:25 | 2024-03-03 09:30 | **49h 5min** |  Very Slow |

**Average Resolution Time:** ~20.4 hours  
**Significantly Longer Cases:** Cases **102, 104, and 105** (all exceed 24 hours)

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### Factor A: Escalations to Level-2 Agent

| Case | Escalation? | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 101 | No | 2h 15min |
| 102 | **Yes** | 25h 10min |
| 103 | No | 1h 20min |
| 104 | No | 24h 10min |
| 105 | **Yes** | 49h 5min |

**Finding:** Both escalated cases (102 & 105) are among the slowest. Case 105 with escalation is the longest at 49+ hours.

### Factor B: Waiting Time Analysis (Activity-to-Activity Gaps)

#### Case 102 (Escalated - 25h 10min)
| Transition | Wait Time | Issue |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Triage  Assign | 30 min | Normal |
| Assign  Escalate | **2h 30min** |  Delay before escalation |
| Escalate  Investigate | **2h 30min** |  L2 agent availability |
| Investigate  Resolve | **19h** |  Overnight delay |

#### Case 104 (No Escalation - 24h 10min)
| Transition | Wait Time | Issue |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Receive  Triage | **40 min** |  Slow triage |
| Assign  Investigate | **3h 30min** |  Agent idle time |
| Investigate  Resolve | **19h** |  Overnight delay |

#### Case 105 (Escalated - 49h 5min)
| Transition | Wait Time | Issue |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Escalate  Investigate (L2) | **28h** |  Critical L2 bottleneck |
| Investigate (L2)  Resolve | **19h** |  Overnight delay |

#### Comparison with Fast Cases (101 & 103)
- Maximum wait between activities: **40 minutes**
- No escalations
- All resolved within same business day

## 3. Key Findings & Recommendations

###  Root Cause 1: Level-2 Escalation Bottleneck

**Problem:** When tickets are escalated to Level-2, there's a significant delay before investigation begins.
- Case 102: 2.5 hours wait after escalation
- Case 105: **28 hours wait** after escalation

**Recommendations:**
1. **Increase Level-2 capacity** or implement on-call L2 support
2. **Define SLAs for escalated tickets** (e.g., L2 must begin investigation within 1 hour)
3. **Implement priority queuing** for escalated tickets

---

###  Root Cause 2: Long Gaps Between Assignment and Investigation

**Problem:** Significant idle time after ticket assignment before work begins.
- Case 104: 3.5 hours between assignment and investigation
- Case 102: 2.5 hours at L1 before escalation decision

**Recommendations:**
1. **Workload balancing** - ensure agents aren't overloaded
2. **Real-time dashboards** showing aging tickets
3. **Auto-assignment based on agent availability**, not just queue order

---

###  Root Cause 3: Overnight/Cross-Day Delays

**Problem:** Tickets that aren't resolved same-day incur ~19-hour overnight delays.
- Cases 102, 104, 105 all have overnight gaps

**Recommendations:**
1. **Prioritize near-completion tickets** before end of shift
2. **Consider extended support hours** for critical tickets
3. **Implement shift handoff procedures** to continue work on pending tickets

## Summary Table

| Root Cause | Affected Cases | Impact | Priority |
|------------|----------------|--------|----------|
| L2 Escalation Delays | 102, 105 | +25-28 hours | **HIGH** |
| Assignment-to-Investigation Gap | 102, 104 | +2.5-3.5 hours | MEDIUM |
| Overnight Delays | 102, 104, 105 | +19 hours each | **HIGH** |
| Slow Initial Triage | 104 | +40 min | LOW |

**Key Insight:** The combination of escalation + overnight delay creates a compounding effect. Case 105 experienced both, resulting in the longest resolution time (49+ hours vs. the benchmark of ~1.5 hours for straightforward cases).
