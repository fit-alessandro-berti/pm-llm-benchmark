Based on the provided event log, the low-level events can be aggregated into five distinct high-level process steps. These groupings are based on the logical transition of the product through the manufacturing line, the resource types involved, and the specific goals of each phase.

### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

| High-Level Activity Name | Included Low-Level Activities | Primary Resource(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Material Loading & Preparation** | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet | Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1 |
| **2. Core Assembly (Welding)** | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B | Operator B |
| **3. In-Process Quality Validation** | Measure weld integrity | Quality Sensor #1 |
| **4. Surface Treatment & Finishing** | Apply protective coating, Dry coating | Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2 |
| **5. Final Inspection & Sign-off** | Visual check | Operator C |

### Justification for Groupings

#### 1. Material Loading & Preparation
*   **Rationale:** This group encompasses all activities required to move a raw component from inventory into a "work-ready" state. 
*   **Justification:** The sequence begins with physical retrieval and identification (scanning), followed by positioning (placing/aligning) and environmental conditioning (preheating). These events are temporally clustered at the start of the CaseID and are performed by a mix of logistics operators and setup machinery.

#### 2. Core Assembly (Welding)
*   **Rationale:** This represents the primary value-added transformation where the product is physically altered or joined.
*   **Justification:** These events are performed by a single resource (Operator B) using a specific toolset (Tool ID: W-12). The activities (picking up the tool and performing multiple welds) are functionally inseparable; the "Pick up tool" event is a necessary precursor to the welding actions.

#### 3. In-Process Quality Validation
*   **Rationale:** This is an automated checkpoint designed to ensure the integrity of the previous assembly step before proceeding to irreversible finishing steps.
*   **Justification:** While brief, this step is distinct because it involves a specialized resource (Quality Sensor #1) and generates a data output (IntegrityScore) rather than a physical change to the part. Separating this allows the manufacturer to identify if defects are occurring specifically during the welding phase.

#### 4. Surface Treatment & Finishing
*   **Rationale:** These events focus on the protection and aesthetics of the product rather than its structural assembly.
*   **Justification:** The activities—application of polyurethane and subsequent drying—are chemically and logically linked. They involve specialized finishing equipment (Coating Unit and Heating Unit #2) and occur after the structural integrity has been verified but before the product is cleared for release.

#### 5. Final Inspection & Sign-off
*   **Rationale:** This is the final gatekeeping step performed by a human to ensure the finished product meets all standards.
*   **Justification:** This event is performed by a new resource (Operator C) and serves as the terminal point of the process. It differs from the "In-Process" check because it is a holistic "Visual check" rather than a specific sensor measurement of a weld.

### Process Summary View
By aggregating the data this way, the complex 12-line event log for Case A1 is reduced to a clean 5-step workflow:

1.  **Preparation** (08:00:05 – 08:00:20)
2.  **Welding** (08:01:00 – 08:01:10)
3.  **Validation** (08:01:20)
4.  **Finishing** (08:01:30 – 08:01:45)
5.  **Sign-off** (08:02:00)

This high-level view makes it significantly easier to perform bottleneck analysis (e.g., seeing if the "Finishing" stage takes longer than "Assembly") and improves the readability of the manufacturing lifecycle.
