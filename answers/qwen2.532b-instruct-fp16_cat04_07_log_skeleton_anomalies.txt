Based on the provided activity occurrences and directly-follows constraints, we can identify several anomalies or inconsistencies in the process. Here are a few:

1. **Directly-Follows Constraints with Limited Activity Occurrences:**
   - The constraint `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')` suggests that after a declaration is for approval by the supervisor, it can be rejected due to missing information. However, there are very few occurrences of "FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" (only 2) and similarly limited occurrences of "REJECTED by MISSING". This makes it difficult to validate if this directly-follows constraint occurs frequently enough to be considered a regular part of the process.
   
   - The same applies to `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')`. Again, there are only limited occurrences for "FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER" (only 2).

2. **Unusual Activity Sequences:**
   - There is a constraint `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')`, which suggests that after the administration has approved a declaration, it can revert back to being submitted by the employee. This seems counterintuitive and may indicate an anomaly in the process model.

3. **Inconsistent Activity Counts:**
   - There are more occurrences of certain activities (e.g., "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" or "REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION") compared to others, suggesting that some steps might be skipped or repeated frequently.
   
4. **Missing Transitions:**
   - It appears there is no directly-follows constraint for transitions where a declaration moves from being saved to approved/rejected stages (e.g., `('Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER')`). This could indicate a missing link in the process.

5. **Process Flow Issues:**
   - There is no clear path or constraint for transitioning directly from "APPROVED" to "FINAL_APPROVED" states (e.g., `('Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')`). This suggests a potential gap in the process flow.

6. **Activity Occurrences Imbalance:**
   - There is an imbalance in activity occurrences, with some activities having significantly more instances than others, which might suggest inefficiencies or bottlenecks within certain stages of the process.
   
7. **Potential Loops and Reversals:**
   - Some constraints imply reversals or loops (e.g., `('Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER', 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE')`) that may not represent a typical workflow, indicating potential anomalies.

These inconsistencies suggest that the process model might need to be reviewed for accuracy and completeness. It is important to ensure all valid transitions are captured correctly and any unusual patterns or missing links are addressed.
