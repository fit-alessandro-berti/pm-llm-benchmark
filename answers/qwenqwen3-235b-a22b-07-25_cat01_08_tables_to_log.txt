# Process Mining Event Log

Below is the integrated event log derived from the provided ERP tables. Each row represents a single event in the lifecycle of an order, with events sequenced chronologically by `order_id`. The log includes the required fields: **Case ID**, **Activity Name**, **Timestamp**, **Resource/Actor**, and additional relevant attributes.

---

## Assumptions Made

1. **Case ID**: `order_id` is used as the case identifier, as specified.
2. **Activity Derivation**:
   - "Order Created" from `Orders.order_date`.
   - "Item Picked" for each line in `Order Lines`, with one event per item picked.
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" for each delivery shipment (multiple events per order if split shipments exist).
   - "Invoice Issued" for each invoice in the `Invoice` table.
   - "Payment Received" for each payment in the `Payments` table.
3. **Resource Mapping**:
   - Used the `Resources` table to map IDs (e.g., `WH-001`  "David Lin") to real names and roles.
   - For carriers, the carrier company name is used as the resource.
   - Billing and sales persons are mapped accordingly.
4. **Timestamps**:
   - All timestamps are taken directly from source fields.
   - For multi-shipment orders, dispatch and arrival events are treated separately.
5. **Chronological Order**:
   - Events are sorted per `order_id` by timestamp to reflect actual process flow.

## Notes

- **Order 1004** has no delivery, invoice, or payment records. This may indicate an incomplete order (e.g., not yet shipped or invoiced), but all available events are included.
- **Payment Resource**: The `Payments` table does not specify a person who received the payment. Hence, "Resource/Actor" is left as "—" (unknown).
- **Item Category**: Enriched using the `Products` table to add context to picking events.
- **Multiple Deliveries/Invoices**: Order 1002 had two deliveries and two invoices, both captured as separate events.
- **Event Granularity**: Each item pick is treated as a distinct event since different warehouse staff may be involved and timestamps differ.

This event log is now suitable for process mining analysis (e.g., discovery of process models, bottleneck detection, compliance checking).
