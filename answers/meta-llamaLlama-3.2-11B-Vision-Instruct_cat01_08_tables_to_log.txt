### Activity Derivation Logic

1.  **Order Created**: Directly identified from the `Orders` table with order creation dates.
2.  **Item Pick**: Identified from the `Order Lines` table based on item pickup dates, linking the `item_id` back to different process steps where applicable.
3.  **Order Dispatch**: Through the `Delivery` table, specifically focusing on dispatch dates, which imply the delivery process initiation.
4.  **Order Arrived**: Utilizing the `Delivery` table for arrival dates, signaling the end of the delivery process for each order.
5.  **Invoice Issued**: Found in the `Invoice` table, where the issue date marks the creation and issuance of an invoice for each order.
6.  **Payment Received**: Extracted from the `Payments` table, focusing on payment dates to track all payment instances against invoices.

### Assumptions and Logic Choices

-   The first `Order Created` and `Order Arrived` events were chosen for representativeness.
-   Payment logic tracks each payment date, acknowledging that some orders might have multiple payments without requiring a new event for each as the timestamp represents the payment's completion.
-   The `Item Pick` events include only the initial picking of each item type for simplicity, though you could track pickings individually or cumulatively based on the specific requirements of the data.

Each row in the final event log corresponds to a single event within the process instance, ensuring that every order instance (case ID) is comprehensively recorded from initial creation through completion. This structured table is now ready for analysis in a process mining tool.
