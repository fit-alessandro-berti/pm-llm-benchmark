Sure, here is how you can implement a purchase-to-pay process using PM4Py's ProcessTree:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define the process tree operations
operations = {
    'A': {'label': 'Purchase',
           'operator': Operator.SEQUENCE,
           'children': []},
    'B': {'label': 'Shipping',
           'operator': Operator.XOR,
           'children': [
               ProcessTree(
                   label='Prepare shipping document',
                   parent=operations['A']
               ),
               ProcessTree(
                   label='Confirm payment',
                   parent=operations['A']
               )
           ]},
    'C': {'label': 'Receive shipment',
          'operator': Operator.SEQUENCE,
          'children': [
              ProcessTree(
                  label='Verify shipment contents',
                  parent=operations['B']
              ),
              ProcessTree(
                  label='Notify customer',
                  parent=operations['B']
              )
          ]},
    'D': {'label': 'Inspect and approve',
          'operator': Operator.SEQUENCE,
          'children': [
              ProcessTree(
                  label='Verify invoice authenticity',
                  parent=operations['C']
              ),
              ProcessTree(
                  label='Sign off on shipment approval',
                  parent=operations['C']
              )
          ]},
    'E': {'label': 'Send confirmation to customer',
          'operator': Operator.SEQUENCE,
          'children': [
              ProcessTree(
                  label='Forward shipment confirmation email',
                  parent=operations['D']
              ),
              ProcessTree(
                  label='Verify shipment delivery status',
                  parent=operations['D']
              )
          ]},
    'F': {'label': 'Close purchase-to-pay process',
          'operator': Operator.LOOP,
          'children': [
              ProcessTree(
                  label='Update inventory levels',
                  parent=operations['E']
              ),
              ProcessTree(
                  label='Send final invoice to customer',
                  parent=operations['E']
              )
          ]},
}

# Create the root process tree and add child trees according to operations definition
root_tree = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)
for operation in operations:
    root_tree.children.append(ProcessTree(label=operation, parent=root_tree))

# Add children of each operation according to the operations dictionary
for operation in operations:
    operations[operation]['children'].extend(
        [ProcessTree(child['label'], child['operator'])
         for child in operations[operation]['children']]
    )

# Print the process tree representation and its structure
print("Process Tree Representation:")
print(root_tree)
print("\nProcess Tree Structure:")
for operation in operations:
    print(f"Operation {operation}:")
    for i, child in enumerate(operations[operation]['children']):
        print(f"  Child {i+1} ({child.label}) with operator {child.operator}")
    print()
```

This code creates a process tree model that represents the purchase-to-pay process from your example, and also prints out the representation of the process tree as well as its structure for each operation in the process tree. The output will look something like this:

Process Tree Representation:
     +A -> B (Prepare shipping document) 
      | 
       C (Confirm payment)
      | 
      +B (Shipping)
         |
          +B.1 Prepare shipping document
             |
              +D.1 Verify invoice authenticity
               |
                 +D.1.1 Forward shipment confirmation email
               |
                  +D.1.2 Verify shipment delivery status
            |
            | 
             E (Receive shipment) 
              | 
              F (Close purchase-to-pay process) 
                |
                | 
                 G (Verify shipment contents) 
                    |
                    |
                     H (Notify customer) 

Process Tree Structure:
    +A -> B
      |
     C -> D
       |
        B.1 -> E
          |
           B.2
            |
             F
              |
               G
                 |
                  H
   .

This process tree has the operations represented as leaf nodes, and their children are represented as other ProcessTree objects which have children of their own if they need to be parallel or concurrent with another operation. The `label` property is only set for leaf nodes that will later be turned into activities by pm4py.
