Based on the provided normative process description, the following cases deviate from the intended process flow:

**Deviant Cases:** Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5.

## Detailed Analysis of Deviations

### Case 1 (Compliant)

Case 1 follows the expected sequence for sufficient inventory: Receive $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ Package items $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order. All ordering constraints (Check before Authorize, Authorize before Package, Package before Ship) are satisfied.

### Case 2 (Deviant)

**Sequence:** Receive $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ **Package items** $\rightarrow$ **Authorize payment** $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.

**Violation:** **Incorrect Ordering of Authorization and Packaging.**

The normative description clearly sets a sequential constraint between authorization and packaging:
1. "Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and **before packaging**."
2. "'Package items' should only occur **after authorization** and before shipping..."

In Case 2, "Package items" (10:00) precedes "Authorize payment" (10:30). This violates the principle that items must be authorized for payment before they are prepared for shipment.

### Case 3 (Deviant)

**Sequence:** Receive $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Cancel order** $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close order.

**Violation:** **Shipping After Cancellation.**

The normative description establishes that cancellation is a termination point for fulfillment activities: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)... 'Ship order' should ... **never after a cancellation**."

In Case 3, the "Ship order" activity occurs after the "Cancel order" activity. This is a fundamental violation of the process logic, as a canceled order should not proceed to fulfillment steps.

*(Note on Ambiguity: While it is unusual to authorize payment and then immediately cancel, this sequence (Authorize $\rightarrow$ Cancel) is not explicitly forbidden. However, the subsequent shipment is a clear and direct violation.)*

### Case 4 (Compliant)

Case 4 follows the expected sequence for insufficient inventory: Receive $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Cancel order $\rightarrow$ Close order. No fulfillment activities are performed, and the order closes correctly after cancellation.

### Case 5 (Deviant)

**Sequence:** Receive $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close order.

**Violation:** **Skipping Mandatory Packaging Step Before Shipping.**

The normative description requires a specific sequence for fulfillment steps: "Package items should only occur after authorization and **before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped**."

In Case 5, the "Package items" activity is entirely missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." Shipping an order without first packaging the items violates the explicit requirement that preparation (packaging) must precede the actual shipment.
