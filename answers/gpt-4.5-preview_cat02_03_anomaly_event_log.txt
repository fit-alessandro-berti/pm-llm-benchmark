Upon reviewing the provided event log, several anomalies stand out based on general knowledge of the standard "Procure-to-Pay" (P2P) business process. The standard sequence of a well-defined P2P process typically includes:

**Standard P2P sequence (for reference):**  
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Receive Goods  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO / Goods Receipt (3-way match)  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case

Below are the anomalies identified, along with explanations of why they represent problematic practice:

---

### Anomaly #1: Case ID 1002 - Approval step occurs after issuing PO and payment release prematurely

**Observed sequence (Case 1002):**  
- Create Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  Vendor Invoice Received  Release Payment  Approve Purchase Requisition  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO  Close Case

**Problem Explanation:**  
- **Issuing PO before approval**: The Purchase Order was issued prior to the approving the requisition, indicating a bypass of internal controls. Typically, a purchase requisition must be fully approved before a formal commitment occurs (issuing a PO).
- **Early release of payments before goods receipt and invoice matching**: Releasing funds prior to receiving the goods and verifying correctness via matching is a critical internal control breach, increasing risk of fraud, financial loss, or payment for undelivered or incorrect items.

### Anomaly #2: Case ID 1003 - Release of payment prior to receiving goods and invoice verification

**Observed sequence (Case 1003):**  
- Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  Release Payment  Vendor Invoice Received  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO  Close Case

**Problem Explanation:**  
- **Payment released prematurely**: Typically, payment should always follow the verification that goods have been actually received and that the invoice matches the goods receipt and the purchase order ("three-way match"). Releasing payment significantly before goods and invoice validation makes the organization susceptible to risks such as non-delivery, misdelivery, fraud, or disputes with the vendor.

### Anomaly #3: Case ID 1004 - Receiving goods before the Purchase Order is issued

**Observed sequence (Case 1004):**  
- Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Receive Goods  Issue Purchase Order  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case

**Problem Explanation:**  
- **Receiving goods prior to formal issuance of PO**: Receiving goods without an official purchase order poses significant operational challenges and compliance risks. Normally, the vendor should not fulfill deliveries without an official purchase order. This practice complicates internal controls, accounting, budgeting, and supplier relationships. It may also indicate an underlying informal or unauthorized arrangement, which may create compliance and audit issues.

### Overall Impact of these Anomalies:  
The anomalies identified above all represent deviations from internal control systems central to standard "Procure-to-Pay" operations. Common internal controls include:

- Ensuring proper authorization chain (Approval before purchase commitment).  
- Verifying physical receipt of ordered goods (Goods Receipt step).  
- Conducting a three-way match among PO, invoice, and actual goods received before payment.

**Risk implications of anomalies:**  
- Financial mismanagement due to early/unverified releases of payment.  
- Possible fraudulent activities or loss of funds.  
- Increased difficulty in audit trails and compliance monitoring.  
- Weakening of supplier management and vendor relationships due to unclear, conflicting or non-standard procedures.

Organizations following best practices adhere strictly to the approved standardized sequence to mitigate risks, ensure operational efficiency, financial accuracy, compliance, and accountability. The anomalies identified above violate established business standards, posing risks and control problems for the organization.
