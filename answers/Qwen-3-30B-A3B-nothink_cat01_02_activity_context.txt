### **Analysis and Renaming of Activities**

#### **Step 1: Identify Recurring Activities with Contextual Differences**

Several activities appear multiple times across different cases, but their **contextual meaning changes** based on the **stage in the process**, the **resource involved**, or the **nature of the action**.

Here are the key activities that recur and require renaming:

| Original Activity      | Case ID | Contextual Differences |
|------------------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Verify Documents**   | C001, C002, C003 | - First time: Initial verification of documents<br>- Second time: Re-verification after additional documents are provided or after account adjustments |
| **Call Customer**      | C001, C002, C003 | - First call: To request missing documents or clarify info<br>- Second call: Follow-up to confirm actions or adjustments |
| **Adjust Account**     | C002, C003 | - Internal correction of account details after a call or issue |

### **Step 2: Rename Activities to Reflect Context**

Here are the renamed activities, along with the reasoning:

| Original Activity      | Renamed Activity                          | Reasoning |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Verify Documents**   | **Initial Document Verification**         | First-time check of documents. |
| **Verify Documents**   | **Re-Verify Documents**                   | Second-time check, often after additional info is provided or after account changes. |
| **Call Customer**      | **Request Missing Documents**             | First call to ask customer for missing info. |
| **Call Customer**      | **Confirm Adjustments**                   | Second call to confirm that actions have been completed. |
| **Adjust Account**     | **Internal Account Adjustment**           | Refers to internal correction of account details. |

### **Step 3: Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities**

| Case ID | Activity                          | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

### **Step 4: Justification of Naming Choices**

- **Initial Document Verification** / **Re-Verify Documents**:  
  - **Initial** refers to the first time documents are checked.  
  - **Re-Verify** indicates that the verification is being repeated, often after additional information is provided or after a correction.

- **Request Missing Documents** / **Confirm Adjustments**:  
  - **Request Missing Documents** is used when a call is made to get additional or missing information.  
  - **Confirm Adjustments** is used when a follow-up call is made to ensure that changes or corrections have been made.

- **Internal Account Adjustment**:  
  - This clarifies that the action is performed internally and not by the customer, avoiding ambiguity with other account-related activities.

### **Conclusion**

By renaming the recurring activities based on their **context and purpose**, the event log becomes more **readable and semantically precise**. This helps in better process analysis, monitoring, and automation, as each activity now clearly reflects its role in the workflow.
