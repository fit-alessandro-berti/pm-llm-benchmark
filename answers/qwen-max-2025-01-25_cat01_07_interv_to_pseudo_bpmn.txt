### BPMN-like Textual Process Model for Invoice Approval Process

#### **Participants/Roles:**
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**  
2. **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**  
3. **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**  
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**  
6. **Supplier**  

---

### **Process Flow Description**

#### **Start Event:**  
- **Invoice Received**: An invoice is received via email by the Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

---

#### **Activities/Tasks and Sequence Flow:**

1. **Check for Purchase Order (PO) Number**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Description:** Mary checks if the invoice has a valid PO number.  
   - **Sequence Flow:**  
     - If **no PO number**, Mary sends the invoice back to the supplier requesting more details. The process ends here until a corrected invoice is received.  
     - If **valid PO number**, proceed to the next step.

2. **Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Description:** Mary logs the invoice into the accounting system.  

3. **Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Description:** Mary forwards the logged invoice to the Purchasing Officer (Dan) for confirmation of receipt of goods/services.  

4. **Verify Invoice Details Against PO**  
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - **Description:** Dan compares the invoice line items with the PO in terms of quantities, prices, and delivery charges.  
   - **Gateways/Decision Points:**  
     - If **details match**, Dan sends a confirmation email back to Mary. Proceed to the next step.  
     - If **discrepancy exists**:  
       - Dan contacts the supplier directly or asks Mary to hold the invoice until the supplier provides corrections.  
       - In some cases, if the discrepancy cannot be resolved easily, Dan escalates the issue to Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager).  
         - **Sub-process (Exception Handling):**  
           - Karen resolves discrepancies by consulting contracts or contacting suppliers. Once resolved, the process resumes from "Verify Invoice Details Against PO."  

5. **Match Invoice Line Items Against PO**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Description:** After receiving confirmation from Dan, Mary matches the invoice line items against the PO in the system.  
   - **Gateways/Decision Points:**  
     - If **everything matches**, proceed to the next step.  
     - If **discrepancy exists**:  
       - Mary emails Dan for clarification.  
       - If the discrepancy cannot be resolved easily, Mary escalates the issue to Rita (Accounts Payable Supervisor).  
         - **Sub-process (Exception Handling):**  
           - Rita coordinates between departments or contacts suppliers to resolve issues. For informal contracts without a PO, Rita works with department heads to create retrospective POs or decide on rejection. Once resolved, the process resumes from "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO."

6. **Send Invoice for Manager Approval**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Trigger:** Automatic email notification sent to Carlos (Department Manager) after confirming receipt of goods and matching invoice to PO.  

7. **Manager Review and Approval**  
   - **Role:** Department Manager (Carlos)  
   - **Description:** Carlos reviews the invoice details, PO, and confirmation.  
   - **Gateways/Decision Points:**  
     - If **all looks good**, Carlos approves the invoice in the system. Proceed to the next step.  
     - If **issues arise** (e.g., budget discrepancies or unexpected items), Carlos rejects the invoice or asks Mary to investigate further.  
       - **Sub-process (Exception Handling):**  
         - Mary investigates and resolves the issue, potentially escalating to Rita if necessary. Once resolved, the process resumes from "Send Invoice for Manager Approval."

8. **Schedule Payment**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Description:** After manager approval, Mary schedules the invoice for payment.  

---

#### **End Event:**  
- **Payment Scheduled**: The invoice is added to the next payment cycle.

---

### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
1. **Input:** Invoice (received via email).  
2. **Intermediate Artifacts:**  
   - Logged invoice in the accounting system.  
   - Purchase Order (PO) reference.  
   - Confirmation of receipt of goods/services.  
3. **Output:** Approved and scheduled invoice ready for payment.

---

### **Exceptions/Variations:**
1. **Missing PO Number**:  
   - Invoice is sent back to the supplier for correction.  
   - Alternatively, Rita creates a retrospective PO for informal contracts.  

2. **Discrepancies in Invoice Details**:  
   - Handled by Dan, Karen, or Rita depending on complexity.  
   - Process loops back to verification steps until resolved.  

3. **Manager Rejection**:  
   - Investigated by Mary, potentially escalating to Rita.  
   - Process loops back to manager review after resolution.

---

### **Ambiguities/Conflicting Accounts:**
1. **Uncertainty in Escalation Paths**:  
   - While Mary mentions escalating unresolved discrepancies to her supervisor (Rita), Dan does not explicitly mention this in his account. Clarification may be needed on whether all unresolved discrepancies go through Rita or only specific cases.  

2. **Informal Contracts Without POs**:  
   - Rita’s role in handling these cases is mentioned but lacks detailed steps. Further clarification on how retrospective POs are created would improve the model.
