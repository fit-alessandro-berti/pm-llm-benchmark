Sure! Below is the Python implementation of a Process Tree using `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTree`:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define root node with operator 'PARALLEL'
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Create process tree objects for each step in the Purchase-to-Pay process
order = ProcessTree(label="Order")
invoicing = ProcessTree(label="Invoicing", parent=root)
payment = ProcessTree(label="Payment")

# Define children connections
order.parent = root  
root.children.append(order)
invoice_branch = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, label="Invoice")  
order.children.append(invoice_branch)         

invoice_branch.children.append(invoice1)  
invoice_branch.children.append(invoice2)

payment_parent = ProcessTree(label="Payment")
invoice_branch_0 = ProcessTree(label="Cash", parent=payment_parent)
invoice_branch_1 = ProcessTree(label="Check", parent=payment_parent)
payment.children.extend([invoice_branch_0, invoice_branch_1])
payment.parent = payment_parent

payment.parent = root

print(root)
```

### Explanation:
- **`root`** is a root `ProcessTree` node with the operator `'PARALLEL'`. A parallel process tree will execute all its branches simultaneously.
  
- **`order`, `invoice`, and `invoice1`, `invoice2`** are nodes created for each activity in the Purchase-to-Pay process (e.g., `Order`). These nodes have their parent set to `root`.

- The **`invoice_branch`** serves as a container for activities within an invoice branch. It is set as a child of the order node.

- The `Payment` node has two activities: Cash and Check, which are children of `payment_parent`.

### Note:
- Each activity (e.g., Orders), Invoice branches (Invoice1 and 2) should be defined independently similarly to how the Purchase-to-Pay process is modeled.
  
- Setting the parent for each child explicitly ensures that the structure of the process tree fits your model.

Running this script will create a Process Tree representing the hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process with specified activities in parallel.
