Below is a structured approach to aggregating the given low-level events into meaningful, higher-level process steps, along with the rationale and suggested naming conventions.

### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

**1. Material Preparation**  
   **Events Included:**  
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet  
   - Scan barcode  
   - Place metal sheet on table  
   - Align metal sheet  
   - Preheat metal sheet

   **Rationale:**  
   These events focus on getting the raw material ready for the core manufacturing operations. They occur at the beginning, involve basic handling tasks performed by operators and alignment by a robot, and are clearly preparatory in nature. All these steps transform the raw material into a state suitable for further processing.

---

**2. Welding Setup & Execution**  
   **Events Included:**  
   - Pick up welding tool  
   - Weld corner A  
   - Weld corner B

   **Rationale:**  
   Once the material is ready, the process transitions into assembly, starting with the preparation (picking up the welding tool) and the actual welding operations. These events are grouped because they represent a cohesive unit of work related to joining parts together, performed by the same resource type (an operator with a welding tool). The temporal proximity and the focus on structural assembly justify grouping them into one high-level step.

---

**3. Weld Integrity Check**  
   **Events Included:**  
   - Measure weld integrity

   **Rationale:**  
   Immediately following the welding operations, there is a quality assurance step that specifically checks the quality of the weld. Although this is a single event, it is distinct enough—both in function (quality verification) and resource type (a quality sensor)—to warrant its own high-level category. It provides a clear, measurable checkpoint separating the welding phase from subsequent steps.

---

**4. Surface Treatment (Coating & Drying)**  
   **Events Included:**  
   - Apply protective coating  
   - Dry coating

   **Rationale:**  
   After ensuring the welded structure’s integrity, the item undergoes a surface treatment stage. The application of protective coating and its subsequent drying are functionally related to improving the finished product’s durability and appearance. Grouping these two events together under "Surface Treatment" makes sense because they form a logical sub-process focused on surface finishing.

---

**5. Final Inspection**  
   **Events Included:**  
   - Visual check

   **Rationale:**  
   The final stage involves a visual inspection by an operator. This step is separate and final in nature—it confirms that the product meets the required standards before it moves on to the next process (e.g., packaging or shipment). By isolating this step, we clearly define the endpoint of the production process for each item.

### Example Structured Representation

**Case A1:**
```
High-Level Step        | Included Low-Level Events
---------------------------------------------------
Material Preparation   | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, 
                       | Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet

Welding Setup & Exec.  | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B

Weld Integrity Check   | Measure weld integrity

Surface Treatment      | Apply protective coating, Dry coating

Final Inspection       | Visual check
```

**Case B2:**
```
High-Level Step        | Included Low-Level Events
---------------------------------------------------
Material Preparation   | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, 
                       | Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet

Welding Setup & Exec.  | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B

Weld Integrity Check   | Measure weld integrity

Surface Treatment      | Apply protective coating, Dry coating

Final Inspection       | Visual check
```

### Summary

The high-level activities—**Material Preparation**, **Welding Setup & Execution**, **Weld Integrity Check**, **Surface Treatment**, and **Final Inspection**—provide a meaningful segmentation of the complex, low-level event log. Each grouping is justified by logical function, resource specialization, and a natural progression of the manufacturing process. This abstraction helps stakeholders quickly identify the main phases of production and assess process performance at a higher level of detail.
