 To create a comprehensive event log, we will integrate the data from the provided tables. Here's how the final event log might look, with each row representing a single event:

```markdown

**Assumptions Made**:
- The "Items Picked" activity is recorded for each item individually, as it represents a distinct event in the process.
- The "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" activities are linked to the delivery ID, but since they are part of the same shipment, they are associated with the order ID.
- For the "Payment Received" activity, the resource/actor is not specified in the Payments table, so it is left as `(null)`.
- The "Other Attributes" column includes additional relevant information from the joined tables, such as item descriptions from the Products table and invoice amounts from the Invoice table.
- The chronological order is maintained based on the timestamps provided for each activity.
- The event log reflects all the data provided, and no events are missing or ambiguous.

This structured table can be used for process mining to analyze and improve the business process.
