Based on the provided normative process description and event log, here is the analysis:

**Cases Violating the Normative Process:**

The cases that violate the normative process are:

1.  **Case 2**
2.  **Case 3**
3.  **Case 5**

**Explanation of Violations:**

Here's a detailed explanation for each violating case:

1.  **Case 2:**
    *   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.
    *   **Violation:** This case violates the expected sequence for the sufficient inventory path regarding the "Authorize payment" and "Package items" activities. The normative description states that "Authorize payment" should occur *after* "Check inventory" and *before* "packaging", and "Package items" should occur *after* authorization.
    *   In Case 2, "Package items" happens *before* "Authorize payment". This contradicts the rule that "Package items should only occur after authorization" and "Authorize payment should only occur... before packaging".

2.  **Case 3:**
    *   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order.
    *   **Violations:** This case exhibits multiple violations:
        *   **Ship after Cancel:** The normative description explicitly states that "Ship order" must "never after a cancellation" and lists "shipping after cancellation" as a clear violation. In Case 3, "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
        *   **Ship without Package:** The description states that "Ship order" should "only occur after packaging". In Case 3, "Package items" never occurs, yet "Ship order" does.
        *   **Contradictory Branching (Implied):** While not explicitly forbidden sequentially, having "Authorize payment" (suggesting sufficient inventory) followed immediately by "Cancel order" (suggesting insufficient inventory) indicates a process flow that deviates from the intended clean branch based on the inventory check outcome. The text suggests *either* continuing with fulfillment *if* sufficient, *or* proceeding to cancellation *if* insufficient. However, the explicit rules about subsequent steps (like not shipping after cancellation) are clearer violations.

3.  **Case 5:**
    *   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.
    *   **Violation:** This case violates the required sequence for the sufficient inventory path by skipping the "Package items" step before shipping. The normative description states that "Package items" should occur *after* authorization and *before* shipping, and "Ship order" should "only occur after packaging".
    *   In Case 5, "Ship order" happens immediately after "Authorize payment" without the intermediate "Package items" activity ever taking place, violating the rule that shipping requires prior packaging.

**Cases Adhering to the Normative Process:**

*   **Case 1:** Follows the full, sufficient inventory path exactly as described (Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close).
*   **Case 4:** Follows the insufficient inventory path exactly as described (Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close).

These two cases demonstrate the two expected, compliant sequences outlined in the normative description.
