1. Throughout the entire cycle, which single hand-off or communication point is most vulnerable to delays or miscommunication, and what early indicators warn you that it’s slipping?  
2. When a document comes back after revision, can you walk me through who actually signs off on it as “complete” and what criteria they apply before the process resumes?  
3. How often do two or more properties for the same landlord arrive in parallel? How does your process handle capacity contention on photographers, inspectors, or marketing resources in those cases?  
4. How exactly do you aggregate the multiple factors—workload, geography, specialization, and landlord complexity—into the final property-manager assignment decision? Is the process fully algorithmic, partly subjective, or gateway-reviewed by a person each time?  
5. How far in advance do you lock in the move-in date relative to publishing the listing? Can other steps accelerate or decelerate to keep that date, and what criteria determine whether the move-in date is ever moved?  
6. When the property manager and landlord cannot agree on a maintenance or repair issue surfaced in inspection, what escalation path exists, and who makes the final go/no-go decision for underwriting the cost?  
7. Describe a scenario in which a landlord supplied a fully-compliant inspection report from another certified agency. How do you validate or reject that third-party report within your workflow?  
8. What feedback loops exist between tenant screening and marketing quality? If you consistently receive “wrong fit” applications, how is that information channeled back to the marketer and photographer?  
9. How are custom lease clauses documented so that downstream compliance, IT, and customer-service teams know they exist and can enforce them without having to re-read the full contract?  
10. What is the clearest example you can recall where an exception (special insurance requirement, furnished-unit insurance rider, HOA approval) significantly reshaped the timeline or team involvement, and how did you communicate that ripple effect to all parties?
