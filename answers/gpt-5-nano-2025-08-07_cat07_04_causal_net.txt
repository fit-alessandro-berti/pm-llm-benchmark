This is a workflow/process diagram (a Petrinet style model) of a request-handling procedure.

- Left side: The main flow starts at a = “register request” and moves through activities b, c, d, f, and e, with multiple branches and loops, eventually leading to g (pay compensation) or h (reject request), and finishing at z = “end.”
- Each rounded rectangle is an activity/action; the small black circles are the control places (tokens) that route flow through the diagram via directed edges.
- The arrows show the precedence/flow and there are loops that allow rework (reinitiate or re-examine, etc.).

Inset (bottom-right): Illustrates common control-flow patterns:
- Top row: XOR-split, AND-split, OR-split
- Bottom row: XOR-join, AND-join, OR-join
These show how the main diagram can branch or synchronize multiple paths.

In short, it’s a visual model of a processing workflow with conditional and parallel routing, plus a legend of the split/join types used.
