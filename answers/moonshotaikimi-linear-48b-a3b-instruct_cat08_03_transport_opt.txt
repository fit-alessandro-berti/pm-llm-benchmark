# Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels Optimization

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Integration and Preprocessing

**Data Integration Strategy:**

1. **Unified Event Model Creation:**
   - Define a standardized event schema combining all data sources
   - Map GPS events (vehicle status changes) to delivery milestones using timestamps
   - Link scanner events to vehicle GPS data via time proximity and location matching
   - Correlate maintenance logs with vehicle operations by Vehicle ID

2. **Key Integration Challenges:**

   **Temporal Misalignment:**
   - GPS data at 1-5 minute intervals vs. scanner events at delivery moments
   - Maintenance logs recorded in separate systems
   
   **Location Matching:**
   - GPS coordinates vs. customer addresses require geocoding and spatial matching
   - Different coordinate systems and accuracy levels
   
   **Case ID Definition:**
   - GPS: Vehicle-ID + Date (e.g., V12-20241205)
   - Scanner: Vehicle-ID + Date + Route-Stop sequence
   - Dispatch: Route-ID + Date
   
   **Resolution:** Create flexible case ID patterns recognizing multiple groupings

3. **Data Quality Handling:**
   - Filter out impossible events (negative travel times, unreasonable speeds)
   - Handle missing data through interpolation or case exclusion
   - Validate against operational constraints (e.g., max daily driving hours)

### Process Discovery Visualization

**End-to-End Process Model:**

1. **High-Level Activity Nodes:**
   - Depot Operations (shift start, load vehicles)
   - Route Execution (travel segments, delivery stops)
   - Exception Handling (maintenance, failed deliveries)
   - Return Operations (arrive depot, shift end)

2. **Process Graph Construction:**
   - Use Alpha+ or Heuristic Miner for initial discovery
   - Apply Inductive Miner for accurate models with noise
   - Generate multiple perspectives (directly follows, causality, response)

3. **Process Variants Identification:**
   - Separator-based approach to identify common vs. rare paths
   - Sequence clustering to find typical vs. atypical execution patterns
   - Quantify frequency and duration of each variant

### Conformance Checking Against Planned Routes

**Deviation Analysis Framework:**

1. **Sequence Conformance:**
   - Map planned route order vs. actual delivery sequence
   - Identify replanning events (route deviation, emergency reordering)
   - Calculate route efficiency: (planned distance - actual distance)/planned distance
   
2. **Temporal Conformance:**
   - Compare actual vs. planned timestamps at each milestone
   - Identify cases: actual start - planned start > threshold
   
3. **Specific Deviation Types:**
   - Added Detours: Locations visited out of route sequence
   - Unplanned Maintenance: Vehicle stopped for repairs outside scheduled maintenance
   - Customer Service Extensions: Time spent per customer exceeding estimated service time
   - Rerouting Events: Significant course changes mid-route
