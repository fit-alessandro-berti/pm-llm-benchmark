Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative rules and the desiderata. The user provided two parts: Part 1 is the strict rules, and Part 2 are the recommended but not strict guidelines. The event logs for three cases are given, and I need to check which ones violate the strict rules and which ones just miss the recommendations.

Starting with the first task: identifying violations of normative rules. Let's look at each case one by one.

Case 1:
- The steps are in order: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Doc  Close. That follows the sequence exactly. The approved path requires finalize before closing, which they did. So no violations here. All steps in order, no skips. So Case 1 is okay.

Case 2:
Looking at the events here. The first step after application is Risk Assessment at 08:20, but before that, there should be a Credit Check. The next event after application is Risk Assessment, but the Credit Check comes later at 08:30. Wait, the order here is wrong. The Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Here, Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check. That's a violation of the ordering rule (Credit Check before Risk Assessment). So that's a normative violation. Then, after the Loan Decision (Rejected), they did Finalize Documentation. But according to the rules, if rejected, you can't finalize before closing. The steps here: after rejection, they go to Finalize Doc and then close. That's another violation. So two violations here: first the Credit Check after Risk Assessment, and second finalizing after rejection.

Case 3:
Application received on the 12th. Then Credit Check on the 14th, which is 48 hours later (since 12th to 14th is two days, so 48 hours). The desideratum says Credit Check should be within 24 hours. So that's a desideratum violation, but not a normative one. Then the Inform Applicant happens on the 16th, which is 4 days after the loan decision (since loan decision was on 14th at 12 PM, then informed on 16th at 3 PM. Wait, the loan decision was on 14th 12pm, so the inform should be within 48 hours. Let's calculate the time between 14th 12pm and 16th 3pm. That's 2 days and 3 hours, which is 57 hours. So that's over 48, so that's a desideratum violation. Also, there's no Follow-up Call mentioned, which is a desideratum but not required. So the normative rules here are followed: the steps are in order. Credit Check before Risk Assessment, then decision, inform, then finalize and close. Since it's approved, they did finalize before closing. So the steps are correct. So the violations here are only desiderata.

Now, moving to the second task: desiderata violations. For Case 3, the Credit Check took 48+ hours (so over 24h, which is a violation of the first desideratum). The informing was after 48h (actually longer), so that's another. Also, missing the follow-up call. But those are all desiderata, so not strict. 

Now, for the third part: possible justifications. For Case 2's first violation (Risk before Credit Check), maybe there was an error in the process, like a staff member forgot to do the credit check first. Alternatively, maybe the system allowed the Risk Assessment to proceed without checking? But according to the rules, that's a strict violation. The second violation (finalize after rejection) could be a mistake in the process, like an employee thought the rejection still needed docs, but the rules say no. 

For Case 3's desiderata issues: maybe the Credit Check was delayed due to some issue (like processing time), but it's still a violation of the recommendation. The late inform could be due to administrative delays. The missing follow-up call might be an oversight but not a critical error.

Wait, let me check Case 2 again. The events for case 2:

Application on 11th 8am. Then Risk Assessment at 8:20, then Credit Check at 8:30. So the order is wrong. The Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So that's a clear violation. Then after Loan Decision (Rejected at 9:30), they do Finalize Doc at 10:00, then close. Since it's rejected, they can't finalize before closing. So that's another violation. So two normative violations here.

Case 3's steps are all in order, so no normative issues. Only the desiderata.

Another thing to check: in Case 2, after the Loan Decision (Rejected), they did Finalize Documentation. The rule says if rejected, you must close without finalizing. So the Finalize here is between the decision and closing, which is not allowed. So that's a violation. So yes, two violations in case 2.

Now, the answer should list which cases violate the normative rules (Case 2), and which have desiderata issues (Case 3 and maybe others? Let's see. The other cases: Case1 is okay. Case2's desiderata? The timing for case 2: the Credit Check was done at 8:20? Wait no, in case 2, the Credit Check was done after the Risk Assessment. Wait the first event after application is Risk Assessment at 8:20, then Credit Check at 8:30. So the Credit Check is done 10 minutes after the Risk Assessment. But the Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So the timing for Credit Check in case 2 is actually after the Risk Assessment, so the time between application and Credit Check is 20 minutes (from 8:00 to 8:20? Wait no. Wait the application is at 8:00, then Risk at 8:20, then Credit Check at 8:30. So the Credit Check is 30 minutes after application, but the Risk was done before that. So the Credit Check is after the Risk, which violates the order. The time window for Credit Check (within 24h) is not the issue here because the problem is the order, not the timing. So the desiderata for case 2: maybe the Credit Check was done quickly (within 24h), but since the order is wrong, that's a normative issue. The other desiderata for case 2? The informing time? Let's see. The loan decision was at 9:30 (Rejected), then they finalized (which is invalid), then closed at 10:30. The informing was not listed here. Wait looking back at case 2's events:

Wait the events for case 2:

After Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30), then Finalize Doc (10:00), then Close (10:30). Wait, but where is the "Inform Applicant" step? The steps should be Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  then either finalize or close. In case 2, after the Loan Decision (Rejected), they went to Finalize Doc, but according to the rules, after the decision, you must inform the applicant first. Wait, the normative constraints say: "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision." So in case 2, after the Loan Decision (Rejected), they didn't inform the applicant before finalizing or closing? Let me check the events again:

Looking at case 2's events:

The steps are:

Application, then Risk (wrong order), then Credit Check (after Risk, which is wrong), then Loan Decision (Rejected), then Finalize Doc, then Close. Wait, but where is the "Inform Applicant" step? The Loan Decision must be followed by informing the applicant. In case 2, after the Loan Decision (at 09:30), the next step is Finalize Documentation at 10:00. So they skipped informing the applicant. That's another violation! Because the Inform Applicant must come after Loan Decision. So that's a third violation in case 2. Oh right! Because the process requires that after the loan decision, you inform the applicant. So in case 2, they went from Loan Decision (Rejected) to Finalize Doc, skipping informing. That's a violation of the ordering rule (Inform must be after Loan Decision). So that's another issue. So case 2 has three violations:

1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order wrong)
2. Finalize Documentation after rejection (not allowed)
3. Skipped Inform Applicant after Loan Decision (since Inform must come after decision, but they went to Finalize instead)

Hmm, that's a problem. Let me check the event log again for case 2:

Looking at the table:

Case 2's events:

- 2024-01-11 08:00: Application

- 08:20: Risk Assessment (no prior Credit Check)  violation 1

- 08:30: Credit Check (after Risk, so violation 1 continues)

- 09:30: Loan Decision (Rejected)

Then next is 10:00: Finalize Documentation  but according to the rules, after Loan Decision, must inform applicant first. So the Inform Applicant step is missing here. So that's violation 3. Then they did Finalize, which is not allowed for rejection, so violation 2. So three violations here. 

So that's important. The user's event log for case 2 shows that after the Loan Decision, they went to Finalize, skipping Inform. So that's a problem. 

Therefore, case 2 has three normative violations. 

Now, moving to the desiderata. Let's check all cases again for desiderata:

Case1: 

- Credit Check was done 30 minutes after application (within 24h: yes, so okay.

- Inform Applicant was at 13:00, which is 2 hours after loan decision (decision at 11:00, inform at 13:00  2 hours, which is within 48h. So that's okay. 

- Follow-up call? Not mentioned, but it's a desideratum, so not required. So no desiderata issues here.

Case2:

- Credit Check was done at 08:30, which is 30 minutes after application (so within 24h  okay for that desideratum. But the order was wrong, so that's a normative issue, not desiderata.

- The Inform Applicant was skipped entirely. Since the desiderata includes informing promptly (within 48h), but here they didn't inform at all. That's a violation of the desideratum? Wait, the desideratum says "it is preferred that ... the applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision)". Since they didn't inform at all, that's a violation of the desideratum. But since the normative requires informing after the decision, not informing is a normative violation. Wait, the normative constraints say "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision." So skipping that step is a normative violation. Therefore, in case 2, the lack of Inform Applicant is a normative violation (since it's required), not just a desideratum. So that's part of the first task's answer.

Therefore, the desiderata violations are only in case3. Let me confirm:

Case3's desiderata issues:

- Credit Check took 48 hours (from 12th 9am to 14th 10am: that's 48 hours exactly? Let's see: from Jan 12 9am to Jan 14 9am is 48h, then to 10am is 49h. So over 24h, so violates the first desideratum (Credit Check within 24h).

- Inform Applicant was on Jan 16 15:00. The loan decision was on Jan14 12:00. The time between is 2 days and 3 hours (45 hours?), which is over 48? Wait, from 14th 12pm to 16th 3pm: 2 days and 3 hours. 2*24=48 +3 =48h30m. So over 48h, so violates the second desideratum (inform within 48h). 

- No Follow-up Call: that's a desideratum, so that's another. 

So case3 has three desiderata violations. 

Other cases: case2's desiderata? The only possible is the Follow-up Call, but since they didn't do the Inform step at all, maybe they also didn't do a follow-up. But the main issue is that the missing Inform is a normative violation. 

So summarizing:

Normative violations (must be fixed):

Case 2:

1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order violation)
2. Skipped Inform Applicant after Loan Decision (required step missing)
3. Finalize Documentation after rejection (not allowed)

Desiderata violations (suboptimal but allowed):

Case3:

- Credit Check delayed over 24h
- Inform Applicant after 48h+
- No Follow-up Call

Now, the third part: suggest interpretations or justifications. 

For Case2's errors:

- The Risk before Credit Check: Maybe the system allowed the Risk Assessment to proceed without checking if Credit Check was done. Or an error in the process flow. 

- Skipped Inform: Perhaps the staff thought that since it's a rejection, they didn't need to inform? But the rules say you must inform regardless. Or maybe an oversight.

- Finalize after rejection: Maybe the staff misunderstood the rules, thinking that even rejections need some doc processing, but the rules say no.

For Case3's desiderata:

- Credit Check delay: Maybe the credit bureau was slow, or the application was complex. 

- Late notification: Maybe administrative delays or high workload.

- No follow-up: Maybe oversight or not prioritized, but not critical.

Now, putting all this into the answer as per the user's request.
</thought>

### 1. **Normative Rule Violations**  
**Case 2** violates the normative constraints in three ways:  
- **Violation 1:** Risk Assessment (08:20) occurred **before Credit Check (08:30)**, breaching the requirement that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.  
- **Violation 2:** After the Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30), the process skipped the **"Inform Applicant"** step entirely. The rule mandates informing the applicant *after* the decision.  
- **Violation 3:** Finalize Documentation (10:00) was performed *after a rejection*, which is prohibited. Rejected cases must close without finalizing documentation.  

**Cases 1 and 3** adhere to all normative rules.  

---

### 2. **Desiderata (Recommended Practice) Violations**  
**Case 3** fails to meet recommended guidelines:  
- **Credit Check Delay:** The Credit Check (Jan 14, 10:00) occurred **49 hours after application submission** (Jan 12, 09:00), exceeding the 24-hour recommendation.  
- **Delayed Notification:** The applicant was informed **51 hours after the Loan Decision** (Jan 14, 12:00  Jan 16, 15:00), violating the 48-hour prompt notification guideline.  
- **Missing Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call was recorded, though it is encouraged.  

**Cases 1 and 2** do not violate desiderata (Case 2’s issues are normative).  

---

### 3. **Interpretations/Justifications**  
**For Case 2’s Normative Violations:**  
- **Risk  Credit Order:** Possible workflow automation error (e.g., Risk Assessment trigger activated prematurely) or human error.  
- **Skipped Inform Step:** Staff may have assumed rejection notifications were optional or misinterpreted the rules.  
- **Finalize After Rejection:** Misunderstanding the process, such as believing documentation was still required for rejections.  

**For Case 3’s Desiderata Issues:**  
- **Credit Check Delay:** External factors (e.g., delayed credit bureau response) or resource constraints.  
- **Late Notification:** Administrative backlog or misprioritization of communications.  
- **No Follow-up Call:** Resource constraints or oversight, though not critical to compliance.
