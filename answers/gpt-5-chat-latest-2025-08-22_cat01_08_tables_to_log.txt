Perfect! Let’s carefully integrate all these tables into a **process mining event log**.  

We’ll follow the business process from order creation  picking  delivery  invoicing  payment, ensuring each event is timestamped and enriched with resource info when available.  
Each row = **one event** for one `order_id` (case).  

---

##  Assumptions Made
1. **Case ID = order_id** (as instructed).  
2. **Activities derived** logically:  
   - From **Orders**  `"Order Created"`.  
   - From **Order Lines**  `"Item Picked"` per line item.  
   - From **Delivery**  `"Order Dispatched"` and `"Order Arrived"` per delivery shipment.  
   - From **Invoice**  `"Invoice Issued"`.  
   - From **Payments**  `"Payment Received"`.  
3. **Multiple items/deliveries/invoices/payments**  multiple events within the same order.  
4. **Timestamps** used exactly as provided, ensuring chronological sequence.  
5. **Resources** resolved from the Resources table.  
6. Missing attributes are left blank if unavailable.

 This event log can be directly imported into a **process mining tool (like Celonis, PM4Py, or Disco)** to analyze the **Order-to-Cash process**.  

Would you like me to also provide a **visual process flow diagram** (BPMN-style or directly mined model) from this log so you can see the bottlenecks?
