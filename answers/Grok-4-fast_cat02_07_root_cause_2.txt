### 1. Identification of Cases with Performance Issues

To identify performance issues, I calculated the lead time (duration) for each case as the time difference in hours between the "Submit Claim" event (start) and the "Close Claim" event (end). With only five cases, "significantly longer" is defined here as durations exceeding 10 hours—well above the low-complexity benchmarks of ~1.5 hours, capturing clear outliers while accounting for minor variations.

| Case ID | Duration (Hours) | Status                  |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 2001   | 1.50            | Normal (fast completion)|
| 2002   | 25.92           | **Performance issue**  |
| 2003   | 48.33           | **Performance issue**  |
| 2004   | 1.42            | Normal (fast completion)|
| 2005   | 77.08           | **Performance issue**  |

The cases with issues (2002, 2003, and 2005) account for over 90% of the total process time across all cases, indicating bottlenecks that could scale poorly.

### 2. Analysis of Attributes and Root Causes

I analyzed correlations between case attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) and durations, including the number of "Request Additional Documents" events per case (a key driver of delays). Key findings:

- **Complexity as Primary Driver**: Higher complexity strongly correlates with longer durations and more document requests. Low-complexity cases complete in under 2 hours with zero requests, while medium and high cases involve 1–3 requests, each adding multi-day waits (e.g., customer response times).

| Complexity | Avg. Duration (Hours) | Avg. # Doc Requests | Example Cases |
|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Low       | 1.46                 | 0                  | 2001, 2004   |
| Medium    | 25.92                | 1                  | 2002         |
| High      | 62.71                | 2.5                | 2003, 2005   |

- **Number of Document Requests**: This has a near-perfect correlation (0.999) with total duration, as each request introduces sequential delays (e.g., end-of-day requests in 2003 and 2005 spill over to the next business day).

- **Region**: Region B shows a moderately higher average duration (34.8 hours vs. 24.9 hours in A), driven by its mix of medium/high cases and potentially higher workload (3/5 cases). However, low-complexity cases in B (2004) perform comparably to A, suggesting region alone isn't the root cause but amplifies complexity issues.

| Region | Avg. Duration (Hours) | # Cases | Notes |
|--------|-----------------------|---------|-------|
| A     | 24.92                | 2      | Balanced (1 low, 1 high) |
| B     | 34.81                | 3      | Skewed by medium/high cases |

- **Resources**:
  - **Adjusters**: Adjuster_Lisa (handling 2002, 2004, 2005) has a higher average duration (34.8 hours) than Adjuster_Mike (24.9 hours), possibly due to handling more medium/high cases and multiple requests per case. However, both perform well on low complexity.
  - **Managers**: Manager_Bill (approving 2003 and 2005, both high complexity) correlates with much longer durations (62.7 hours avg.) vs. Manager_Ann (9.6 hours avg. across low/medium). This may reflect assignment patterns rather than individual performance, as Bill only handles high-complexity approvals.
  - CSR and Finance roles show minimal variance, as they handle routine steps without delays.

Overall, **Complexity** is the dominant root cause (explaining ~80% of variance via doc requests), with **Region B** and **Adjuster_Lisa/Manager_Bill** as secondary factors tied to case assignment.

### 3. Explanations and Mitigation Suggestions

- **Explanation for Complexity**: High-complexity claims inherently involve more verification steps, leading to iterative document requests. Each request creates a "handover" delay (e.g., waiting for customer uploads), compounded by business hours—seen in 2003 (2 requests over 2 days) and 2005 (3 requests over 3 days). Medium complexity (2002) shows even a single request can cause overnight spillover if not resolved same-day. This aligns with process design, where incomplete initial submissions in complex cases bottleneck evaluation/approval.

- **Explanation for Region**: Region B's higher average may stem from geographic factors like higher claim volumes, slower inter-team coordination, or customer demographics (e.g., remote areas delaying document submission). It's not causal alone but exacerbates complexity delays.

- **Explanation for Resources**: Adjuster_Lisa's higher average reflects overload on medium/high cases, where repeated requests tie up capacity. Manager_Bill's correlation is likely due to selective assignment to complex approvals, delaying sign-off (e.g., late-day approvals in 2003/2005).

**Mitigation Suggestions**:
- **For Complexity/Doc Requests**: Implement upfront validation tools (e.g., AI checklists during "Submit Claim") to reduce initial gaps by 30–50%. Prioritize high-complexity cases with expedited customer portals for faster document turnaround. Set SLAs (e.g., resolve requests within 24 hours) and track per-adjuster to prevent iteration loops.
- **For Region**: Conduct region-specific audits to balance workloads (e.g., route some B cases to A for overflow). Cross-train teams to handle peak volumes, targeting a 20% reduction in B's average via shared resources.
- **For Resources**: Rotate high-complexity assignments evenly among adjusters/managers to avoid burnout (e.g., cap Lisa at 2 high cases/week). Provide targeted training for Bill/Lisa on rapid doc triage, potentially cutting approval waits by 1 day. Monitor via dashboards linking resources to request counts.

These changes could reduce average durations by 40–60%, focusing on prevention over reaction.
