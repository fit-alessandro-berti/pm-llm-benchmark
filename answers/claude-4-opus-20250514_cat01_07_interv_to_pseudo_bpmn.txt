Based on the interview transcripts, here is a BPMN-like textual process model for the Invoice Approval Process:

## Invoice Approval Process Model

### Process Participants/Swimlanes:
- **Supplier** (External)
- **Accounts Payable Clerk** (Mary)
- **Purchasing Officer** (Dan)
- **Department Manager** (Carlos)
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor** (Rita)
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Karen)

### Process Flow:

**Start Event:** Invoice received (typically by email)

**1. Initial Invoice Receipt and Validation** (Accounts Payable Clerk)
- Receive invoice from supplier
- **Gateway 1 (Exclusive):** Check if invoice has valid PO number
  - *No PO:* Send invoice back to supplier requesting PO details  End Event (Invoice Rejected)
  - *Has PO:* Continue to next step

**2. Invoice Logging** (Accounts Payable Clerk)
- Log invoice into accounting system

**3. Receipt Confirmation Request** (Accounts Payable Clerk  Purchasing Officer)
- Forward invoice to Purchasing Department for goods/services receipt confirmation

**4. Receipt Verification** (Purchasing Officer)
- Open PO in system
- Compare invoice details against PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges)
- **Gateway 2 (Exclusive):** Are invoice details correct?
  - *Details match:* Send confirmation email to Accounts Payable  Continue to step 5
  - *Discrepancy found:* Two possible paths:
    - Contact supplier directly for correction
    - Request Accounts Payable to hold invoice  **Sub-process: Discrepancy Resolution**
  - *Missing PO (edge case):* Notify Accounts Payable that PO is required  Return to Gateway 1

**5. Invoice-PO Matching** (Accounts Payable Clerk)
- Match invoice line items against PO in system
- **Gateway 3 (Exclusive):** Does invoice match PO?
  - *Match confirmed:* Continue to step 6
  - *Discrepancy found:* Email Purchasing team for clarification
    - **Gateway 4 (Exclusive):** Can discrepancy be resolved?
      - *Yes:* Return to matching after resolution
      - *No:* Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor  **Sub-process: Exception Handling**

**6. Manager Approval Request** (System/Accounts Payable Clerk)
- System sends automatic email to Department Manager requesting approval
- Invoice details, PO, and confirmation are presented to manager

**7. Manager Review and Approval** (Department Manager)
- Review invoice details, PO, and confirmation
- **Gateway 5 (Exclusive):** Approve invoice?
  - *Approve:* Hit approve in system  Continue to step 8
  - *Reject/Hold:* Request investigation from Accounts Payable
    - Return to appropriate earlier step or escalate to supervisor

**8. Payment Scheduling** (Accounts Payable Clerk)
- Schedule invoice for payment in next payment cycle
- Add to payment run

**End Event:** Invoice approved and scheduled for payment

### Exception Handling Sub-processes:

**Discrepancy Resolution Sub-process:**
- Involves: Accounts Payable Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager
- Activities:
  - Supervisor contacts suppliers or coordinates between departments
  - Supplier Relationship Manager may verify contract terms
  - Supplier may send corrected invoice
  - Once resolved, return to main flow at step 4 or 5

**Exception Handling Sub-process (No PO Match):**
- Involves: Accounts Payable Supervisor
- Activities:
  - Investigate invoices without matching PO
  - Work with department heads to create retrospective PO if needed
  - **Gateway:** Can exception be resolved?
    - *Yes:* Return to main flow at step 4
    - *No:* Reject invoice  End Event

### Key Business Rules:
1. No invoice is approved without a confirmed PO reference
2. Both receipt confirmation and PO matching must be complete before manager approval
3. Manager approval is required for all invoices after verification
4. Discrepancies must be resolved before proceeding to approval
5. Escalation to supervisor occurs when standard resolution attempts fail

### Data Objects/Artifacts:
- Invoice (email/document)
- Purchase Order (PO)
- Confirmation email from Purchasing
- System notifications
- Corrected invoices (when applicable)

### Notes on Process Variations:
- Some invoices may be for services contracted informally, requiring retrospective PO creation
- Supplier corrections may occur at multiple points in the process
- The exact system used for logging and approval is not specified but appears to be integrated with email notifications
