The events clearly separate into **three distinct patient journeys** based on consistent patient attributes (age/gender), department flow, and logical medical sequence.  
Below are the inferred cases:

---

### **Case 1 – ER patient (45yearold male, hairline fracture)**
**Events:** 1  4  7  12  15  
- **1** Register patient (ER)  
- **4** Initial triage  
- **7** Xray imaging (left leg)  
- **12** Doctor consultation (diagnosis hairline fracture)  
- **15** Patient discharged  

---

### **Case 2 – ER patient (62yearold female, infection)**
**Events:** 2  5  8  10  11  14  17  
- **2** Register patient (ER)  
- **5** Initial triage  
- **8** Lab test requested  
- **10** Lab test completed  
- **11** Doctor consultation (minor infection)  
- **14** Prescription created (antibiotics)  
- **17** Patient discharged  

---

### **Case 3 – Surgery patient (28yearold male, knee arthroscopy)**
**Events:** 3  6  9  13  16  18  
- **3** Register patient (Surgery)  
- **6** Doctor consultation (scheduled knee surgery)  
- **9** Surgery preparation  
- **13** Surgery performed (arthroscopy)  
- **16** Recovery room  
- **18** Patient discharged

 **Final inference:**  
There are **three cases**, corresponding to three distinct patients with consistent age/gender/department flows.
