This visualization displays a process flow diagram, likely representing a business process or workflow, along with a legend explaining the notation used for various types of splits and joins.

The main part of the visualization is the **process flow diagram**:
*   **Nodes (Activities)**: Rectangular boxes labeled with letters (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, z) and corresponding descriptive text. These represent distinct activities or steps in the process.
    *   `a`: register request
    *   `b`: examine thoroughly
    *   `c`: examine casually
    *   `d`: check ticket
    *   `e`: decide
    *   `f`: reinitiate request
    *   `g`: pay compensation
    *   `h`: reject request
    *   `z`: end
*   **Edges (Flows)**: Lines connecting the nodes, indicating the sequence of activities. These lines often pass through small black circles, which appear to represent control flow points (splits and joins).
*   **Splits and Joins**: The black circles act as gateways, directing the flow based on specific logic.
    *   From `a` (register request), there are multiple outgoing paths to `b`, `c`, and `d`. The way the lines converge before splitting suggests an OR-split or AND-split.
    *   Activities `b`, `c`, `d`, and `f` all converge towards `e` (decide), indicating a join.
    *   From `e` (decide), there are two outgoing paths to `g` (pay compensation) and `h` (reject request).
    *   Activities `g` and `h` converge towards `z` (end).
    *   There's a feedback loop from `e` (decide) to `f` (reinitiate request), and from `d` (check ticket) to `f`.

The **legend (gray box)** in the bottom right corner clarifies the meaning of the control flow points:
*   **Split Types (top row)**:
    *   **XOR-split**: One incoming flow, multiple outgoing flows, where exactly one path is taken (exclusive OR). Represented by a single line entering a node, and multiple lines exiting, all passing through the same control point.
    *   **AND-split**: One incoming flow, multiple outgoing flows, where all paths are taken concurrently (parallel execution). Represented by a single line entering a node, and multiple lines exiting, all passing through the same control point, with the lines slightly separated at the split.
    *   **OR-split**: One incoming flow, multiple outgoing flows, where one or more paths can be taken (inclusive OR). Represented by a single line entering a node, and multiple lines exiting, where the control point has curved arcs connecting the outgoing lines.
*   **Join Types (bottom row)**:
    *   **XOR-join**: Multiple incoming flows, one outgoing flow, where the join synchronizes exclusive paths. Represented by multiple lines entering a node, and a single line exiting, all passing through the same control point.
    *   **AND-join**: Multiple incoming flows, one outgoing flow, where the join synchronizes parallel paths, requiring all incoming paths to complete before proceeding. Represented by multiple lines entering a node, and a single line exiting, all passing through the same control point, with the lines slightly separated at the join.
    *   **OR-join**: Multiple incoming flows, one outgoing flow, where the join synchronizes one or more incoming paths. Represented by multiple lines entering a node, and a single line exiting, where the control point has curved arcs connecting the incoming lines.

By cross-referencing the main diagram with the legend, one can infer the specific logic at each split and join point in the process flow. For instance, the split after `a` appears to be an OR-split, allowing the process to proceed to `b`, `c`, or `d` (or some combination thereof). The join before `e` would likely be an OR-join, as multiple paths can lead to it. The split after `e` would be an XOR-split, as the process either pays compensation or rejects the request, but not both.
