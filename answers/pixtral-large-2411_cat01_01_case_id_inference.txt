To infer the case IDs from this complex interleaved sequence of hospital process events, we need to group the events based on attributes such as `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and the logical sequence of activities. Here is the breakdown of how the events can be grouped into separate cases:

### Case Grouping Analysis:

1. **Case 1: Male, Age 45**
   - Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
   - Sequence:
     1. Register patient (ER)
     2. Initial triage (ER)
     3. X-ray imaging (Radiology)
     4. Doctor consultation (ER)
     5. Patient discharged (ER)

2. **Case 2: Female, Age 62**
   - Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
   - Sequence:
     1. Register patient (ER)
     2. Initial triage (ER)
     3. Lab test requested (ER)
     4. Lab test completed (Laboratory)
     5. Doctor consultation (ER)
     6. Prescription created (ER)
     7. Patient discharged (ER)

3. **Case 3: Male, Age 28**
   - Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
   - Sequence:
     1. Register patient (Surgery)
     2. Doctor consultation (Surgery)
     3. Surgery preparation (Surgery)
     4. Surgery performed (Surgery)
     5. Recovery room (Surgery)
     6. Patient discharged (Surgery)

6. `2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, Patient discharged, Ward Clerk, Surgery, 28, M, followup=physiotherapy_sessions`

### Summary:

- **Case 1:** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 (Male, Age 45)
- **Case 2:** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 (Female, Age 62)
- **Case 3:** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 (Male, Age 28)

This grouping is based on the logical sequence of activities and the consistency of patient attributes across different events.
