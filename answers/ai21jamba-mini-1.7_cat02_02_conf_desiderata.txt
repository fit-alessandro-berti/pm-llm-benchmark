### Analysis of Normative Violations and Desiderata Deviations:

#### **1. Identification of Cases with Normative Violations**

Case ID

Activity Order/Timing Violation Reason

**Reason Explanation**

**2**

Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check.

Normative rules require Credit Check to occur before Risk Assessment. This sequence violation is a strict rule breach.

**2**

Finalize Documentation performed after rejection.

Normative rules prohibit Finalize Documentation after a loan rejection. Serious violation of normative rules.

#### **2. Identification of Cases with Desiderata Deviations**

Case ID

Desiderata Violation Reason and Description

**Reason Explanation**

**3**

Credit Check completed after 24 hours of Application Received.

While the Credit Check was delayed beyond the recommended 24-hour window, this does not violate the strict process rules. It is a desiderata deviation.

**3**

Inform Applicant occurred 48 hours after Loan Decision.

The timing for informing the applicant (2 days after decision) is later than the recommended 48-hour window, constituting a desiderata violation.

**3**

No Follow-up Call recorded.

Failing to perform a Follow-up Call is not strictly required but is encouraged. This constitutes a desiderata deviation.

### **3. Justifications and Interpretations**

#### **Normative Rule Violations**

- Case **2** violated two critical normative rules. First, performing **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** directly contradicts the required sequence. This action disrupts the logical flow of the process. Second, conducting **Finalize Documentation after a rejection** is explicitly not allowed. These violations indicate a misunderstanding of the strict rules, potential process control issues, or system errors.

#### **Desiderata Deviations**

- Case **3** presents deviations that, while not ideal, do not breach the core process integrity:
	- The delay in performing the **Credit Check (>24 hours)** is suboptimal, possibly caused by resource unavailability, volume of applications, or prioritization issues. It does not invalidate the process but may impact response times and customer satisfaction.
	- The **Inform Applicant delay (>48 hours)** and lack of **Follow-up Call** are not severe issues. These actions are aimed at improving customer experience and ensuring alignment, but their absence does not compromise the process's validity or completeness.

### **Key Takeaways:**

1. **Normative Rule Violations (Case 2):** These violations necessitate immediate process review and corrective measures, as they compromise the structural integrity of the loan application process.
2. **Desiderata Deviations (Case 3):** These deviations suggest areas for process improvement, particularly in optimizing timelines and enhancing follow-up practices to align with best practices.
