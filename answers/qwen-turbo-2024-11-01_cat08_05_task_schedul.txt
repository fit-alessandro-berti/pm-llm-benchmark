### Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

#### 1.1 Reconstructing and Analyzing the Actual Flow of Jobs

To reconstruct and analyze the actual flow of jobs, we will leverage process mining techniques such as **Process Discovery**, **Conformance Checking**, and **Performance Analysis**. Specifically, we will use the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the MES event logs to ensure consistency and completeness. This includes handling missing values, standardizing timestamps, and ensuring all relevant attributes are captured.

2. **Process Discovery**: Use **Inductive Miner** or **Alpha Algorithm** to discover the process model from the event logs. This will help us understand the actual workflow and task sequences across different machines.

3. **Conformance Checking**: Apply conformance checking techniques to verify if the actual behavior matches the expected process model. This helps identify deviations and anomalies in the production process.

4. **Performance Analysis**: Use performance analysis tools to quantify various metrics related to job flow, task execution, and resource utilization.
