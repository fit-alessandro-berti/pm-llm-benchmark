To identify the main differences between the treatment process variants of the "protected" and "unprotected" groups, we need to analyze the steps involved, their frequency, and the overall performance times. Here are some key observations:

### Key Differences:

1. **Initial Registration Point**:
   - **Protected Group**: Registration can occur at the Emergency Room (ER) or the Diagnostic Facility (FD).
   - **Unprotected Group**: Registration almost always occurs at the FD, with a few exceptions.

2. **Expert Examination**:
   - **Protected Group**: Expert Examination is performed in about 36.0% (103/284) of the cases.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Expert Examination is performed in about 87.0% (1269/1466) of the cases.
   - This suggests that the unprotected group is more likely to undergo an expert examination.

3. **Thorough Examination**:
   - **Protected Group**: Thorough Examination is performed in about 23.3% (66/284) of the cases.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Thorough Examination is performed in about 44.8% (661/1466) of the cases.
   - The unprotected group is significantly more likely to undergo a thorough examination.

4. **Examination Steps**:
   - **Protected Group**: Sometimes skips direct examination steps.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Always follows a more structured sequence, starting with the expert or thorough examination.

5. **Diagnosis and Treatment Steps**:
   - **Protected Group**: Sometimes skips the diagnosis step directly after registration.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Always has a clear sequence of diagnosis followed by treatment.

6. **Discharge**:
   - **Protected Group**: More frequent occurrences of direct discharge without thorough treatment processes.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Discharge is typically only done after thorough diagnosis and treatment.

7. **Treatment Unsuccessful Pathways**:
   - **Protected Group**: Rarely involves multiple unsuccessful treatment attempts (about 2.1%).
   - **Unprotected Group**: More frequent occurrence of multiple unsuccessful treatments (about 7.5%).

### Summary of Main Differences:

1. **Initial Registration Point**: Protected group has more flexibility in registration (ER or FD), while the unprotected group primarily registers at the FD.
2. **Expert Examination**: The unprotected group undergoes expert examinations more frequently.
3. **Thorough Examination**: The unprotected group is more likely to undergo thorough examinations.
4. **Structured Pathways**: The unprotected group follows more structured, comprehensive pathways involving thorough examinations and sequential diagnosis-treatment steps.
5. **Multiple Unsuccessful Treatments**: The unprotected group experiences more instances of multiple unsuccessful treatment attempts.

### Implications:
The differences in the treatment processes might indicate systemic biases or inefficiencies in how the "unprotected" group is managed. The more thorough and structured approach in the unprotected group's processes could suggest a higher level of scrutiny or complexity in their cases, possibly due to more severe conditions or additional complications.

### Recommendations:
- **Standardization of Processes**: Ensure that both groups follow similar structured pathways to reduce variability and potential biases.
- **Review of Expert Examination Criteria**: Assess why the unprotected group is more frequently subjected to expert examinations and whether this can be balanced.
- **Evaluate Unsuccessful Treatment Pathways**: Investigate the higher frequency of unsuccessful treatment attempts in the unprotected group to identify underlying issues and implement corrective measures.

This analysis provides a foundation for identifying and addressing potential unfair differences in treatment processes between the two groups.
