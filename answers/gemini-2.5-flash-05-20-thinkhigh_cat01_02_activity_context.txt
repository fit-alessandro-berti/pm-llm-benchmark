The provided event log demonstrates how a single activity name can have different meanings and purposes depending on its preceding events, state of the case, and specific context. By analyzing the "Additional Context" and the sequence of activities within each case, we can disambiguate these recurring activities.

### 1. Activities Identified for Renaming:

The activities that appear multiple times within the same case, and whose meaning changes contextually, are:

*   **`Verify Documents`**: Appears twice in C001 and C003, with different purposes based on the preceding actions. Appears once in C002, but its *initial* meaning is consistent across cases.
*   **`Call Customer`**: Appears once in C001 and C003, and twice in C002, each time serving a distinct purpose.

Activities like `Initiate Request`, `Submit Additional`, `Adjust Account`, and `Approve Request` appear only once per case and thus do not require disambiguation within a *single* case, although their *overall* definition might vary slightly in source (e.g., WebPortal vs. BranchReception for Initiate Request). The prompt specifically asks about activities appearing "multiple times within a single case."

### 3. Justification for Naming Choices:

Here's a breakdown of the renamed activities and the contextual clues that led to these changes:

*   **Original Activity: `Verify Documents`**
    *   **New Name: `Initial Document Verification`**
        *   **Justification:** This renaming applies to the first instance of "Verify Documents" in all cases (C001, C002, C003). The "Additional Context" ("Agent checks identity documents.", "Identity verification.", "Physical verification of ID.") consistently indicates that this is the first attempt at verifying the customer's identity documents right after the request initiation.
    *   **New Name: `Re-verify Submitted Documents`**
        *   **Justification:** Seen in C001. This activity occurs *after* the customer has performed "Submit Additional" (renamed to `Submit Additional Documentation`). The context "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided" signifies that this is a subsequent verification prompted by new information provided by the customer, aiming to complete an previously incomplete verification.
    *   **New Name: `Post-Adjustment Document Re-verification`**
        *   **Justification:** Seen in C003. This instance occurs *after* an "Adjust Account" (renamed to `Adjust Account Details`) activity. The context "Re-verify docs after account adjustment" implies a need to re-confirm document validity or consistency in light of internal account corrections or updates.

*   **Original Activity: `Call Customer`**
    *   **New Name: `Request Missing Information Call`**
        *   **Justification:** Seen in C001. The context "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs" clearly defines the specific purpose of this call: to solicit necessary, missing information from the customer required for the ongoing verification process.
    *   **New Name: `Clarify Account Discrepancy Call`**
        *   **Justification:** Seen as the first "Call Customer" in C002. The context "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy" precisely identifies the reason for the call as addressing an inconsistency or issue with the customer's account details.
    *   **New Name: `Confirm Account Adjustment Call`**
        *   **Justification:** Seen as the second "Call Customer" in C002. Occurring *after* "Adjust Account" (renamed to `Adjust Account Details`), the context "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made" highlights its role as a confirmatory step, ensuring the customer is aware of and agrees with the changes made to their account.
    *   **New Name: `Request Customer Return Call`**
        *   **Justification:** Seen in C003. The context "Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return" specifies a unique scenario where the customer physically left the branch, and the call's purpose is to request their return to complete an in-person process.

*   **Original Activity: `Submit Additional`**
    *   **New Name: `Submit Additional Documentation`**
        *   **Justification:** Although it appears only once per case (in C001), the original name is slightly ambiguous. Renaming it to "Submit Additional Documentation" adds clarity and specificity about *what* is being submitted (documents, specifically an ID scan, as per context), which is crucial for the preceding and subsequent "Verify Documents" steps.

*   **Original Activity: `Adjust Account`**
    *   **New Name: `Adjust Account Details`**
        *   **Justification:** Similar to "Submit Additional", this activity appears once per case (in C002 and C003). Renaming it to "Adjust Account Details" provides more precision about the nature of the adjustment, implying specific data or configurations within the account, aligning with the context of "Adjust account details internally" or "Internal correction due to missing info."

These refined activity names provide a much clearer and more precise understanding of the workflow, making process analysis, bottleneck identification, and compliance checks significantly more effective.
