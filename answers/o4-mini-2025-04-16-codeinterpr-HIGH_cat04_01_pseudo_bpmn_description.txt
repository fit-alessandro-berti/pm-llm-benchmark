Here’s a step-by-step “walk-through” of what your pseudo-BPMN is modeling, why each element is there, how decisions and parallels work, and how the two major branches (Standard vs. Custom) converge, loop, and re-work.

1. Start Event  
   – The trigger that kicks off the entire process (e.g. a new order or request arriving).

2. Task A: “Receive Customer Request”  
   – Capture all the basic info from the customer (order form, specs, contact details).  
   – Outputs a structured request record for the next step.

3. Gateway (XOR) “Check Request Type”  
   – An exclusive (mutually-exclusive) branch: only one path can be taken.  
   – Decision criterion: is this a “Standard” request or a “Custom” request?

4. Standard Path  
   4.1 Task B1: “Perform Standard Validation”  
       – Run routine checks against pre-defined rules/packages.  
       – Examples: Is the part number valid? Does the customer have a standing contract?  
   4.2 Gateway (AND) “Run Parallel Checks”  
       – A true parallel split: both checks happen at the same time.  
       – Task C1: “Credit Check”  
            • Verify customer’s credit status or payment terms.  
       – Task C2: “Inventory Check”  
            • Confirm that standard item(s) are in stock or can be reserved.  
   4.3 Join (AND-Join) “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
       – Wait until both Credit Check and Inventory Check finish.  
   4.4 Task D: “Calculate Delivery Date”  
       – Based on stock availability and lead times, compute the promised ship/delivery date.

5. Custom Path  
   5.1 Task B2: “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
       – Examine engineering effort, tooling, special materials, etc.  
   5.2 Gateway (XOR) “Is Customization Feasible?”  
       – Exclusive decision: can we build it to spec?  
       – If No  Task E2  “Send Rejection Notice”  End Event  
            • Customer is informed we can’t fulfill; process terminates.  
       – If Yes  Task E1  “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
            • Calculate custom price, lead time, any special conditions.

6. Convergence of Standard & Custom (pre-Approval)  
   – Both Task D (Std) and Task E1 (Custom) feed into the same next gateway.  
   – Implicit Merge: “We have either a delivery date (Std) or a quotation (Cust).”

7. Gateway (XOR) “Is Approval Needed?”  
   – Decision rule might be based on order value, margin thresholds, policy exceptions, etc.  
   – Two possible paths: Yes  manager must sign off; No  skip to invoicing.

8. If Approval Is Needed  
   8.1 Task F: “Obtain Manager Approval”  
         – Route the quote/order details to a manager or oversight committee.  
   8.2 Gateway (XOR) “Is Approval Granted?”  
         – Manager either approves or rejects.  
         – If Approved  proceed to Task G.  
         – If Not Approved  Task H: “Re-evaluate Conditions”  
             • Re-pricing, adjust delivery date, tweak specs, renegotiate terms.  
             • From H there is a loop back edge to:  
                – Task D for Standard orders (re-compute delivery date under new terms)  
                – Task E1 for Custom orders (re-issue a revised quotation)  
             • After the rework you again hit the “Is Approval Needed?” decision.

9. If No Approval Needed  
   – Bypass Steps F/H entirely and go straight to Task G.

10. Task G: “Generate Final Invoice”  
    – Produce the official billing document.  
    – Contains final price, payment terms, delivery date, etc.

11. Task I: “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
    – Email or portal message that attaches the invoice, confirms order details.  
    – Could also trigger downstream logistics or production systems.

12. End Event  
    – The process instance concludes once the customer has been informed.

Gateways in Detail  
• XOR (Exclusive) Splits (“Check Request Type,” “Is Customization Feasible?,” “Is Approval Needed?,” “Is Approval Granted?”)  
  – Only one outgoing branch is taken, based on a simple yes/no or case value.  

• AND (Parallel) Split & Join (“Run Parallel Checks”)  
  – Both Credit Check and Inventory Check fire simultaneously.  
  – The process waits at the join until *both* branches finish before moving on.

Convergence & Looping  
• After the Standard branch (Task D) and the Custom branch (Task E1) complete, they implicitly merge at the “Is Approval Needed?” gateway.  
• If a manager rejects, the “Re-evaluate Conditions” Task H feeds back into the appropriate earlier task (D for standard; E1 for custom), forming a loop until approval is obtained (or the customer withdraws).

Key Differences: Standard vs. Custom  
• Standard  
  – Linear validation  parallel credit & inventory checks  compute delivery date.  
  – Usually faster, uses fixed rule sets and stock data.  
• Custom  
  – Feasibility study first  either scrap request or build a unique quotation.  
  – More iterative (you may need multiple quote revisions under manager oversight).

Approval & Rework Conditions  
• Approval is driven by business rules (e.g. order size, margin impact, non-standard terms).  
• A “No” at “Is Approval Granted?” triggers the only looping/rework path in the entire process.  
• Rework returns you exactly to the point where a new calculation or quotation makes sense, then you retry approval.

Taken together, this pseudo-BPMN describes a robust order-management process that handles routine (“standard”) and bespoke (“custom”) requests, performs all necessary checks, ensures managerial oversight when thresholds are hit, and loops intelligently to handle rejections or re-pricing—all before producing an invoice and confirming to the customer.
