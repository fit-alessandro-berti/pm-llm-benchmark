### **Analysis of Ticket Resolution Delays**  

#### **1. Identifying Cases with Longer Resolution Times**  
The total resolution time for each ticket is calculated from the "Receive Ticket" timestamp to the "Close Ticket" timestamp.

| Case ID | Start Time           | End Time             | Total Resolution Time |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00     | 2024-03-01 10:15     | **2 hours 15 minutes** |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05     | 2024-03-02 09:15     | **25 hours 10 minutes** |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10     | 2024-03-01 09:30     | **1 hour 20 minutes** |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20     | 2024-03-02 08:30     | **24 hours 10 minutes** |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25     | 2024-03-03 09:30     | **49 hours 5 minutes** |

Clearly, **Cases 102, 104, and 105** take significantly longer than Cases 101 and 103.

#### **2. Identifying Root Causes of Delays**
A closer look at the activity timelines suggests the following delay factors:

- **Escalations Increase Resolution Time:**  
  - **Case 102** was escalated to Level-2 at 11:30 AM but was not investigated until 2:00 PM. The resolution then only happened the next day at 9:00 AM, indicating a long delay post-escalation.  
  - **Case 105** was escalated at 10:00 AM but was not investigated until 2:00 PM the next day (over 24 hours later).  
  - **Case 104**, although not escalated, shows an extremely long delay before the investigation step.

- **Delays Before Investigation and Resolution:**  
  - **Case 104:** The ticket was assigned to Level-1 at 9:30 AM, but the investigation did not start until 1:00 PM, a delay of 3.5 hours.  
  - **Case 102:** There was a 2.5-hour gap between assignment and escalation, followed by another 2.5-hour delay before the Level-2 agent investigated.  
  - **Case 105:** A massive delay of almost **29 hours** between escalation and investigation caused a major bottleneck.

- **No Delay in Closing Tickets Once Resolved:**  
  - In all cases, the "Close Ticket" step follows immediately after "Resolve Ticket" (within 15-30 minutes), indicating that closure is **not** a bottleneck.

#### **3. Insights and Recommendations**
##### **Key Insights:**
- **Escalation to Level-2 is a major delay factor.** Cases that were escalated (102, 105) took significantly longer to resolve, especially when there was a long delay before the Level-2 agent investigated.  
- **Delays between assignment and investigation prolong resolution times.** Cases with slow investigations (e.g., 104 with a 3.5-hour delay) show inefficient workflows.  
- **Once an issue is investigated, resolution happens quickly.** The actual resolution and closure steps are generally fast.

##### **Recommendations:**
1. **Improve Escalation Handling:**  
   - Ensure that Level-2 agents are notified **immediately** when a case is escalated.  
   - Implement an SLA (Service Level Agreement) requiring Level-2 agents to begin investigation within a set time (e.g., **within 2 hours of escalation**).  

2. **Reduce Delays Before Investigation:**  
   - Automate ticket routing to ensure quick assignment to agents.  
   - Set clear guidelines for Level-1 agents to start investigating within a fixed timeframe after assignment (e.g., **within 30 minutes**).  

3. **Better Workload Distribution:**  
   - If delays are due to agent availability, consider redistributing workload across shifts to balance high-traffic periods.  
   - Increase staffing for Level-2 agents if escalations are frequently delayed.  

By addressing these inefficiencies, the overall resolution time can be improved, reducing delays for high-priority support tickets. ðŸš€
