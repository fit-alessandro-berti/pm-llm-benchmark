Here is the DuckDB SQL query that meets the requirements:
```
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT case_id,
           COUNT(*) as event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
  )
  WHERE event_count <= 6
)
```
Let me explain how this query works:

1. The subquery in the `WHERE` clause counts the number of events per `case_id` using `COUNT(*)`.
2. It groups the results by `case_id` using `GROUP BY`.
3. The outer query uses `IN` to filter the `case_id` values to include only those where the count of events is six or fewer using `WHERE event_count <= 6`.
4. Finally, the `SELECT *` statement returns all columns from the `event_log` table for the filtered `case_id` values.

This query should give you the desired result: all events from cases with six or fewer events in total.
