Below is one way you could represent the DECLARE model for the endtoend productdesignandlaunch process described.  
The keys that require **declarative rules** (support=1.0, confidence1.0) are:

* `existence` – “A product idea exists.”
* `absence` – “A product does not exist.”
* `exactly_one` – “There is exactly one approved design per project.”
* `init` – “The process starts with Idea Generation.”

The other keys that also accept declarative rules (the activities) are grouped together:

```python
declare_model = {
    # 1. Rules about the existence/absence of artifacts
    "existence": {"IG": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "absence":   {"CE", "LT", "UT", "AG", "MP", "FL": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "exactly_one":{"DD": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "init":       {"IG": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},

    # 2. Rules about the activities (the same support/confidence values)
    "responded_existence": {"IG": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "coexistence":         {"DD": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "response":           {"TFC": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "precedence":         {"CE": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "succession":        {"PC", "LT", "UT", "AG", "MP", "FL": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "altresponse":       {"CE": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "altprecedence":     {"TFC": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "altsuccession":     {"PC", "LT", "UT", "AG", "MP", "FL": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "chainresponse":     {"CE", "PC", "LT", "UT", "AG", "MP", "FL": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "chainprecedence":   {"CE", "TFC", "PC": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    "chainsuccession":   {"CE", "PC", "LT", "UT", "AG", "MP", "FL": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    # No noncoexistence, nonsuccession or nonchain succession rules are needed
}
```

### How to read the dictionary

* **Each key** (`'existence'`, `'absence'`, …) maps to a **set of activities** that must (or must not) be present in order for the rule to hold.
* The value for each activity is a **subdictionary** containing:
  * `support`: how many times the activity occurs in traces (`1.0` means it always appears).
  * `confidence`: the proportion of traces where the rule holds given that activity (here all are `1.0`, indicating perfect confidence).

### What this model tells you

* **Existence** – The product idea is only considered “existent” after an Idea Generation event.
* **Absence** – Any other stage (`CE, LT, UT, AG, MP, FL`) being absent would imply the product does not exist.
* **Exactly one design** – Only a single Design Draft activity can be recorded for any given project (the rule is supported everywhere it appears).
* **Initial trigger** – The process begins with an Idea Generation event.

All other activityspecific rules (`responded_existence`, `coexistence`, etc.) simply restate the same support/confidence values, reinforcing that each step behaves deterministically when its predecessor has occurred. This structure can be fed directly into any PM4Py analysis pipeline that works with DECLARE models.
