# Laboratory Testing Process Visualization

This image shows a detailed visualization of a laboratory testing workflow using a process modeling approach called "proclet classes." The diagram is divided into three main parts:

## (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels
The left side depicts the "Lab visit" process flow:
- Starting with "Order entry" performed by a doctor
- Followed by "Take blood sample" done by an assistant
- Then "Receive result" and "Judge results" by a lab assistant
- If "Everything fine," the process continues to "Send report"
- Otherwise, it branches to "Do tests again"

The right side shows the "Lab test" process:
- "Perform test" conducted by a chemical analyst
- "Make report" following the test
- "Finish lab test" marks completion
- Alternative paths include "Perform test again" and "Prepare updated report"

Both processes are interconnected through communication channels (dashed lines) with message exchanges labeled as T1S, T1R, etc.

## (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes
Shows the relationship between "Lab visit" and "Lab test" entities, indicating that a lab visit requires one or more lab tests (1:* relationship).

## (c) Example of a performative
A table showing communication details:
- Time: 11:00
- Channel: Order system
- Sender: Lab visit - John
- Receiver: Lab test - HGB John
- Action: Create
- Content: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
- Scope: Private
- Direction: OUT

This visualization illustrates the coordination between clinical visits and laboratory testing processes in a healthcare setting.
