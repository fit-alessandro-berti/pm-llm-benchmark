Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the database schema and the temporal profile model provided. The database has three tables: claims, adjusters, and claim_events. The claim_events table tracks each activity in the claim handling process with timestamps. The temporal profile model shows average times and standard deviations between different activity pairs.

Looking at the anomalies mentioned in the example, I need to identify the same or any additional anomalies based on the temporal profile. The example already points out four anomalies: R to P, P to N, A to C, and E to N. But maybe there's more to check. Wait, the user wants me to generate similar anomalies. Let me go through each activity pair in the model.

Starting with ('R', 'A'): 1h avg, 10min stdev. That seems normal. Then ('R', 'E'): 1 day avg, 8h stdev. Maybe okay. ('R', 'P'): 25h avg, 1h stdev. The low stdev here is suspicious. High stdevs could indicate variability, but low stdev might mean automation or rigid scheduling without considering actual processing time. Then ('A', 'C'): 2h avg with 1h stdev. If a claim is closed 2 hours after assignment, but the process should go through Evaluate and Approve first, so this might indicate claims being closed too quickly without proper steps. 

('E', 'N'): 5 minutes between Evaluate and Notify. That seems too fast. Maybe notifications are automated right after evaluation, but maybe skipping steps. ('E', 'C'): 1h avg, 50min stdev. Not sure if that's an issue, but maybe if some claims close quickly and others take longer. ('P', 'N'): 7 days avg with 2 days stdev. That's a long time between approval and notification. Maybe a backlog, manual processes, or errors. ('N', 'C'): 30 minutes avg, 5min stdev. Seems okay.

So the main anomalies are R-P, P-N, A-C, E-N. Now, hypotheses for why these exist. For R-P with low stdev, maybe automated approval without proper checks. For P-N long delay, maybe manual steps, backlog, or notifications batched. A-C could be adjusters closing claims without evaluation. E-N being too fast could be automation but maybe missing steps.

For SQL verification, need to find claims where time between these activities is outside the avg ± zeta*stdev. Let's say zeta is, for example, 3. So for R to P, look for claims where (time between R and P) is between avg ± 3*stdev and see if all are tightly clustered. Or check if they always take almost exactly 25 hours. Also, check if certain adjusters or claim types are involved in A-C anomalies. For P-N, see if there's a pattern in regions or adjusters causing delays. For E-N, check if it's always exactly 5 minutes, possibly automated. Also, see if there are claims that go from Assign to Close without Evaluate and Approve steps.

Possible SQL queries: 

1. For R to P: Select claims where time between R and P is outside avg (90000 sec) ± 3*3600. But how to calculate? Maybe get the time difference between R and P events for each claim. Then see if it's outside the expected range.

2. For A to C: Find claims where Assign to Close is quick but missing intermediate steps. Check if there are E or P steps between A and C. If not, those claims were closed without evaluation.

3. For P to N: Look for claims where time between P and N exceeds 7 days + 2 days, or is much less. Also, see if certain regions or adjusters have more delays.

4. For E to N: Check if the time is consistently around 5 minutes. Also, check if Notify happens right after Evaluate without Approve, but according to the process flow, it should be Evaluate -> Approve -> Notify. Wait, the intended steps are R, A, E, P, N, C. So after Evaluate should be Approve, then Notify. So if E to N is 5 minutes, maybe skipping the Approve step? That's a possibility. So check if claims go from E directly to N without P.

So, the SQL queries need to join events for the same claim, calculate time diffs, and filter based on thresholds. Also, check sequences of activities to see if steps are skipped.

### Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **R  P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - *Anomaly:* 25-hour average with a very low standard deviation (1 hour) suggests rigid timing inconsistent with typical manual approval processes.  
2. **P  N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - *Anomaly:* 7-day average delay with high variability (2-day STDEV) indicates inconsistent notification practices.  
3. **A  C (Assign to Close):**  
   - *Anomaly:* 2-hour average between assignment and closure, bypassing expected intermediate steps (Evaluate/Approve).  
4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - *Anomaly:* 5-minute average transition suggests possible skipped steps (e.g., missing approval) or unrealistic automation.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R  P Rigid Timing:**  
   - Automated approval systems may be overriding manual checks, or claims are pre-approved without evaluation.  
2. **P  N Delays:**  
   - Manual notification processes could cause bottlenecks, or approvals trigger secondary reviews that delay notifications.  
3. **A  C Premature Closure:**  
   - Adjusters might close claims erroneously or bypass evaluation for specific claim types (e.g., low-value claims).  
4. **E  N Rapid Notification:**  
   - Notifications could be auto-generated post-evaluation, even if approvals are missing, or the process skips validation.

### Verification SQL Queries

#### 1. Identify Claims with Rigid Receive-to-Approve Timing
```sql
WITH receive_approve_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
    FROM 
        claim_events ce1
    JOIN 
        claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE 
        ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    time_diff
FROM 
    receive_approve_times
WHERE 
    time_diff NOT BETWEEN 90000 - (3 * 3600) AND 90000 + (3 * 3600);  -- ±3 STDEV from avg
```

#### 2. Detect Claims Closed Too Quickly After Assignment
```sql
SELECT 
    a.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS assign_to_close_seconds,
    COUNT(e.event_id) AS intermediate_steps
FROM 
    claim_events a  -- Assign event
JOIN 
    claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN 
    claim_events e ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id 
    AND e.activity IN ('E', 'P') 
    AND e.timestamp > a.timestamp 
    AND e.timestamp < c.timestamp
WHERE 
    a.activity = 'A'
GROUP BY 
    a.claim_id, assign_to_close_seconds
HAVING 
    assign_to_close_seconds < 7200  -- Less than 2-hour avg
    AND COUNT(e.event_id) = 0;      -- No intermediate Evaluate/Approve steps
```

#### 3. Investigate Long Approval-to-Notify Delays
```sql
SELECT 
    p.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS approve_to_notify_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    adj.region
FROM 
    claim_events p  -- Approve event
JOIN 
    claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN 
    claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN 
    adjusters adj ON JSON_EXTRACT_PATH_TEXT(p.resource, 'adjuster_id')::INT = adj.adjuster_id
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 604800 + (2 * 172800);  -- Exceeds avg + 2 STDEV
```

#### 4. Validate Evaluate-to-Notify Automation/Skipped Steps
```sql
SELECT 
    e.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS evaluate_to_notify_seconds,
    CASE WHEN p.event_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing Approval' ELSE 'Approval Present' END AS approval_status
FROM 
    claim_events e  -- Evaluate event
JOIN 
    claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
LEFT JOIN 
    claim_events p ON e.claim_id = p.claim_id 
    AND p.activity = 'P' 
    AND p.timestamp > e.timestamp 
    AND p.timestamp < n.timestamp
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 300 + (3 * 60);  -- Below avg + 3 STDEV
```
