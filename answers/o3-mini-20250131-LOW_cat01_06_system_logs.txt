Below is one transformation of the raw Windows system log into a “processmining friendly” event log. One way to do this is to view the user’s work as a series of document or application–centred sessions (cases). In our interpretation, each “case” is a contiguous work session on one specific document or email thread. We have also “translated” lowlevel system actions into higherlevel activities such as “Edit Document”, “Reply Email”, “Review Document”, “Edit Spreadsheet”, etc.

For example, we group all interactions on Document1.docx (even if they occur in separated periods) into one case when the user is working on that document; similar groupings apply for email processing, for the PDF report and for the other document. (A session “restart” is inferred when the user switches context across applications/documents and when periods of direct user work on a document occur in a block.) In the final event log each row contains a Case ID, a standardized Activity Name, and the timestamp from the raw log. (Additional attributes – such as the application name or window title – could be added later if desired.)

Explanation

1. Grouping into Cases (Case Identification):  
• We treat each work session on a particular document or email thread as a separate case. For instance, all activities for Document1.docx (opening, typing, saving, and closing) are grouped under Case “DOC1”.  
• Similarly, the interactions in the email application—starting from the context switch from Document1 to email—are grouped into “EMAIL1”.  
• The PDF report review actions form “PDF1”, and active work in Excel forms “XLSX1”.  
• The document “Quarterly_Report.docx” is treated as a separate case “DOC2”. (Note that its first observed focus at 08:59:50 is linked with later editing actions. Although there is a gap, we assume the same session reopens later.)

2. Activity Naming (Activity Translation):  
• Low-level actions (e.g., FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, CLICK, SCROLL) are translated into higher-level descriptors such as “Open Document”, “Edit Document”, “Send Email”, and so on.  
• The names include the document or email subject when appropriate so that an analyst can easily tell which artifact the event refers to.

3. Coherent Narrative:  
• The event log tells the story of one work session by capturing the switching between different work tasks (document editing on Word, email replying on Chrome, PDF review on Acrobat and spreadsheet work on Excel).  
• Each event is given a timestamp that preserves the original order, so process mining tools can automatically reconstruct the process flow.

This transformation makes the log easier for analysts to apply standard process mining techniques such as process discovery, performance analysis, and conformance checking.
