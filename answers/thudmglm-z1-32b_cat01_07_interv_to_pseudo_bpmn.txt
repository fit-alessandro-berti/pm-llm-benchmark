**BPMN-Like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **Activities/Tasks**  
1. **Receive Invoice (Email)**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Input:* Invoice (email attachment)  

2. **Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Artifact Interaction:* Cross-reference invoice with PO database  

3. **Return Invoice to Supplier**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Output:* Request for PO or revised invoice (email to supplier)  

4. **Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Artifact Interaction:* System log entry  

5. **Forward to Purchasing Department for Goods Received Confirmation**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Artifact Transfer:* Email with invoice and PO details to Purchasing (Dan)  

6. **Validate Invoice Against PO (Quantity, Price, Delivery Charges)**  
   - *Role:* Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - *Artifact Interaction:* System PO/invoice line-item comparison  

7. **Resolve Discrepancy (Supplier/Retrospective PO)**  
   - *Roles:* Purchasing Officer (Dan) + *Indirect:* Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
     - Contact supplier for revised invoice.  
     - *Exception:* Unresolved discrepancies escalated to Rita.  
   - *Additional Path:*  
     - *Role:* Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
       - Coordinate departments, create retrospective PO, or reject invoice.  
       - *Artifact Interaction:* Retrospective PO approval (department heads)  

8. **Confirm Invoice Matched to PO**  
   - *Role:* Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - *Output:* Automatic system email to AP (Mary)  

9. **Match Invoice Line Items to PO in System**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Artifact Interaction:* System validation (auto/match)  

10. **Escalate Discrepancy to Supervisor**  
    - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
    - Triggered if line-item mismatch persists after Purchasing confirmation.  

11. **Manager Approval**  
    - *Role:* Department Manager (Carlos)  
    - *Input:* System notification with invoice/PO details.  
    - *Decision Path:* Approve  Schedule Payment; Reject  Escalate to AP for resolution.  

12. **Schedule Payment**  
    - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
    - *Output:* Payment scheduled into accounting system (auto process).

### **Sequence Flow**  
1. **Primary Path:**  
   ```  
   Receive Invoice  Check Valid PO   
     No  Return to Supplier  (Loop back to Start if PO is resubmitted)  
     Yes  Log Invoice  Forward to Purchasing   
         Validate Invoice  Confirm Match  Match Line Items   
           Match  Manager Approval  Schedule Payment  
           No Match  Escalate to Supervisor  
                Resolve Discrepancy  Forward to Purchasing (re-validate)  
   ```  

2. **Exception Path (Supplier Involvement):**  
   ```  
   Validate Invoice (Dan)  Discrepancy   
     Resolve via Karen (Supplier Contact)  Confirm Match  
     Unresolved  Escalate to Rita   
         Retrospective PO Approval  Forward to Purchasing  
         Reject  Return to Supplier  
   ```  

3. **Manager Decision Flow:**  
   ```  
   Manager Approval   
     Approve  Schedule Payment  
     Reject  Escalate to AP Clerk (Mary)   
           Forward discrepancy details to Rita for resolution  
   ```

### **Gateways/Decision Points**  
1. **Gateway 1: PO Validity**  
   - *Condition:* Invoice contains a valid PO number (system-checked).  
   - *Yes  Log Invoice | No  Return to Supplier.*  

2. **Gateway 2: Invoice vs. PO Match**  
   - *Condition:* Purchasing confirms invoice matches PO (line items, pricing).  
   - *Yes  Confirm Match | No  Resolve Discrepancy.*  

3. **Gateway 3: Line-Item Match Post-Confirmation**  
   - *Condition:* AP confirms invoice line items align with PO.  
   - *Yes  Manager Approval | No  Escalate to Supervisor.*  

4. **Gateway 4: Manager Decision**  
   - *Condition:* Manager’s approval/rejection.  

---

### **Roles/Participants**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Initiates workflow, logs invoices, escalates unresolved issues.  
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Validates invoices against PO, resolves discrepancies, confirms receipt.  
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Final approver (system-triggered).  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Mediates exceptions (missing PO, historic invoices, escalations).  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Acts as intermediary for supplier resolution.  

---

### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**  
1. **System-Facing Artifacts:**  
   - PO Database  
   - Invoice Log  
   - Payment Schedule  

2. **Physical/Email Artifacts:**  
   - Invoice (email attachment)  
   - Revised Invoice Request (Mary  Supplier)  
   - Confirmation Email (Dan  Mary)  
   - System Approval Triggers (auto-emails to Carlos)  

---

### **Exceptions/Variations**  
1. **Missing PO at AP Step:**  
   - Invoice returned to supplier; process restarts post-submission.  
   - *Uncertainty:* Mary may occasionally proactively request POs, but interviews imply strict decline.  

2. **Pricing Discrepancy During Purchasing Validation:**  
   - Dan/Karen loop to resolve; unresolved issues  Rita.  
   - *Variation:* Retrospective POs for informal agreements.  

3. **Unmatched Line Items Post-Purchasing Confirmation:**  
   - Mary escalates to Rita  resolution loops back to Purchasing.  

4. **Manager Rejection:**  
   - Rare but triggers AP clerk to Rita for deeper investigation.  

---

### **Ambiguities and Notes**  
1. **Rita’s Escalation Path:**  
   - After resolving an exception, the process restarts at Purchasing’s confirmation step, but unclear if AP relogs the invoice. Assumed to transfer seamlessly.  

2. **Direct Supplier Communication:**  
   - Both Dan and Karen mention contacting suppliers; the model prioritizes Dan as the primary handler (Purchasing’s responsibility).  

3. **System Automation:**  
   - Manager approval is triggered automatically post-Purchasing confirmation, but no details on rejection workflows (assumed manual rework).

### **Visualizable Logic (Simplified)**  
```plaintext  
[Start]  Receive Invoice  
            Check PO Validity (No  Return to Supplier)  
            Log Invoice  Forward to Purchasing  
                Validate Invoice (Discrepancy  Resolve (Karen/Dan))  
                Confirm Match  Match Line Items (No match  Rita)  
                    Manager Approval  Schedule Payment  
                                 
                       [End]  
```  
*Exceptions loop back to respective validation steps (PO, line items) via Rita or Karen.*  

This model consolidates stakeholder inputs, highlights critical decision points, and accounts for both standard and exception paths. Ambiguities are minimized but noted where process boundaries remain unclear.
