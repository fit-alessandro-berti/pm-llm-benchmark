In the field of process mining, "process enhancement" is a technique that aims to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of a given business process. It involves identifying areas for improvement by analyzing the process's behavior and then proposing changes to enhance its performance.

Process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking in the following ways:

1. Objective:
   - Process Discovery: The main objective of process discovery is to understand the existing process and its underlying structure. It focuses on uncovering the sequence of activities and their relationships, often by using event logs or process models.
   - Process Enhancement: The primary objective of process enhancement is to improve the performance of the existing process. It focuses on identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement, with the goal of optimizing the process and achieving better outcomes.

2. Approach:
   - Process Discovery: Process discovery techniques often involve analyzing event logs to extract information about the process structure, such as the sequence of activities, parallel execution, or loops. This information is used to create a visual representation of the process, known as a process model.
   - Process Enhancement: Process enhancement techniques involve analyzing the process behavior to identify opportunities for improvement. This can include techniques such as process simulation, bottleneck analysis, and performance metrics calculation. Based on the analysis, recommendations are made to enhance the process's efficiency, effectiveness, and quality.

3. Output:
   - Process Discovery: The output of process discovery is a process model that represents the existing process structure. The model can be used for various purposes, such as process documentation, training, or compliance verification.
   - Process Enhancement: The output of process enhancement is a set of recommendations or improvements to enhance the process's performance. This can include suggestions for process redesign, automation, resource allocation, or workflow optimization.

In summary, process enhancement focuses on improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of a given business process by identifying opportunities for improvement and proposing changes. It differs from process discovery, which aims to understand the existing process structure, and conformance checking, which aims to verify whether the process is being executed correctly according to a given model.
