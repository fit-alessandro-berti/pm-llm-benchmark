Based on the order fulfillment process described, here's the Log Skeleton represented as a Python dictionary. The constraints capture the linear sequence of activities and ensure each step occurs in the correct order with the specified frequency:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No activities must occur the same number of times
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),    # Check Availability must occur after Receive Order
        ('RI', 'CA'),    # Reserve Items must occur after Check Availability
        ('PI', 'RI'),    # Pick Items must occur after Reserve Items
        ('QC', 'PI'),    # Quality Check must occur after Pick Items
        ('PO', 'QC'),    # Pack Order must occur after Quality Check
        ('GSL', 'PO'),   # Generate Shipping Label must occur after Pack Order
        ('D', 'GSL'),    # Dispatch must occur after Generate Shipping Label
        ('IC', 'D'),     # Invoice Customer must occur after Dispatch
        ('RP', 'IC')     # Record Payment must occur after Invoice Customer
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # Receive Order must be followed by Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # Check Availability must be followed by Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # Reserve Items must be followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # Pick Items must be followed by Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # Quality Check must be followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # Pack Order must be followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # Generate Shipping Label must be followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),     # Dispatch must be followed by Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')     # Invoice Customer must be followed by Record Payment
    },
    'never_together': set(),  # No activities are mutually exclusive
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},  # Receive Order occurs exactly once
        'CA': {1},  # Check Availability occurs exactly once
        'RI': {1},  # Reserve Items occurs exactly once
        'PI': {1},  # Pick Items occurs exactly once
        'QC': {1},  # Quality Check occurs exactly once
        'PO': {1},  # Pack Order occurs exactly once
        'GSL': {1}, # Generate Shipping Label occurs exactly once
        'D': {1},   # Dispatch occurs exactly once
        'IC': {1},  # Invoice Customer occurs exactly once
        'RP': {1}   # Record Payment occurs exactly once
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # Receive Order immediately followed by Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # Check Availability immediately followed by Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # Reserve Items immediately followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # Pick Items immediately followed by Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # Quality Check immediately followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # Pack Order immediately followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # Generate Shipping Label immediately followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),     # Dispatch immediately followed by Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')     # Invoice Customer immediately followed by Record Payment
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Constraints:
1. **Always Before/After**:  
   - Ensures activities follow the strict sequence:  
     `RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP`.  
   - `always_before` defines mandatory predecessors (e.g., `CA` must happen after `RO`).  
   - `always_after` defines mandatory successors (e.g., `RO` must happen before `CA`).

2. **Activity Occurrences (`activ_freq`)**:  
   - Each activity occurs exactly once per order (set to `{1}`), reflecting a linear, single-instance process.

3. **Directly-Follows**:  
   - Specifies immediate transitions (e.g., `RO` is immediately followed by `CA`), enforcing step-by-step execution.

4. **Exclusions**:  
   - **Equivalence**: No activities share identical occurrence counts.  
   - **Never Together**: No activities are mutually exclusive (all can coexist in an order).

This model assumes a successful order fulfillment without parallel activities, backtracking, or skipped steps. Adjustments may be needed if exceptions (e.g., unavailable items) are common.
