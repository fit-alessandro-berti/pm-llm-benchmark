Based on the attributes provided, the following attributes are sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether a person is a citizen or not. This is a sensitive attribute because it has the potential to influence the outcome of the loan application process unfairly. For example, loan decisions might be biased against non-citizens.
2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the applicant. Similar to the citizen attribute, this could lead to unfair outcomes if loan decisions are biased against certain genders.
3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant speaks German or not. This could be a sensitive attribute if loan decisions are biased against non-German speakers.
4. **case:resource**: This attribute indicates the resource (e.g., loan officer) that is handling the loan application. This could be a sensitive attribute if different resources have different biases or handling styles, leading to unfair outcomes.
5. **concept:name**: This attribute is essentially the same as the activity attribute, but it's possible that the concept name is being used to encode sensitive information indirectly (e.g., using a specific concept name to indicate a certain demographic group).

**Attributes that might be sensitive but are not explicitly mentioned:**

1. **activity**: While not explicitly mentioned as a sensitive attribute, certain activities (e.g., "Application Rejected") might be related to sensitive outcomes. However, the provided data does not explicitly indicate that the activities themselves are sensitive.
2. **time** and **time:timestamp**: These attributes are timestamp-based and could potentially be used to capture sensitive information (e.g., time of day, day of the week). However, there is no explicit indication that the timestamps themselves are sensitive.

**Attributes that are unlikely to be sensitive:**

1. **activity** (except for specific activities that might be related to sensitive outcomes)
2. **resource** (if the resources are not inherently biased or discriminatory)

Keep in mind that the sensitivity of attributes can depend on the specific context and the goals of the analysis. It's essential to evaluate the sensitivity of attributes based on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
