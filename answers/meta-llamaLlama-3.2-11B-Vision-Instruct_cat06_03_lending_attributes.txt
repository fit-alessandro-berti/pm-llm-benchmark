Based on the provided attributes, the following can be considered sensitive for fairness analysis:

1. **case: citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the borrower is a citizen, and is binary in nature. Fairness analysis may need to consider how the process treats citizens versus non-citizens.
2. **case: gender**: This attribute represents the gender of the borrower, also binary. Fairness analysis should examine how the process treats men and women differently.
3. **case: german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the borrower speaks German, and is binary. Fairness analysis should investigate how the process treats German-speaking borrowers compared to non-German-speaking borrowers.
4. **resource**: This attribute indicates which resource (e.g., Loan Officer, Hotline) is handling the process. Fairness analysis may need to consider how different resources treat borrowers fairly.

These attributes are sensitive because they have the potential to introduce bias into the process. For instance:

* A process might be unfairly biased towards citizens or men, resulting in poorer outcomes for non-citizens or women.
* The use of a specific resource might lead to unequal treatment of borrowers, even if the same process is applied.
* The handling of German-speaking borrowers might differ from non-German-speaking borrowers, leading to unfair outcomes.

Fairness analysis would help identify such biases and suggest potential improvements to ensure fairness in the process.
