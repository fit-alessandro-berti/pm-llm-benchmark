The provided data details a series of transactions in a financial system, organized chronologically and categorizing each transaction based on whether it is approved by various administrative tiers (`ADMINISTRATION`, `BUDGET OWNER` and `SUPERVISOR`) or if any action results in a request for payment. For each entry:

- When a declaration has been passed through multiple approvers with no rejection, the "Performance" field reveals how frequently (and thus, overall efficiency) such approval processes occurred.
- Any time that an exception occurs at the end of any process – e.g., missing a required action like request for payment – the subsequent frequency and performance are displayed prominently.

This structured data stream allows analysis on areas like:
1. Performance: Tracking how often approval stages completed successfully without interruptions across different levels, revealing potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
2. Effort Impact: Understanding which actions take more time compared to others due to exceptions.
3. Compliance Strengths: Identifying if a certain level of approval has fewer rejection outcomes than others.

It provides insights into operational efficiency and areas that may need optimization for enhanced transaction processing times and throughput.
