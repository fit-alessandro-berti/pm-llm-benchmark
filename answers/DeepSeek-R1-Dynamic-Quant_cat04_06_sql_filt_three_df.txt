<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So I need to write a DuckDB SQL query that does several things.

First, identify cases (case_ids) where there's a sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order'. No other events from the same case should be between them. So those three have to come one after another without any gaps.

Second, among those cases that have this sequence, I need to find ones where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Then exclude all events from such cases from the final result.

The final query should return all events except those belonging to these excluded cases. So, events from cases not meeting both criteria are kept, others are removed.

Hmm. Let's break it down.

First step: Identify case_ids with the sequence in order. How do I check for a consecutive sequence? For each case_id, we need to look at their activities ordered by timestamp and see if there's an instance where 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed immediately by 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order'.

One approach: Use window functions to partition the data by case_id, order them by timestamp. Then for each row with activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check the next two activities in the same case.

But maybe a better way would be to find cases where these three activities are consecutive. So perhaps using LEAD or LAG functions?

For example, for each event in a case_id ordered by timestamp, if an activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and the next one is 'Create Order', and then the third is 'Confirm Order'. Then that's the sequence.

So maybe something like:

With a windowed view (partition by case_id order by timestamp), for each row where current activity is 'Approve...', check if the lead(activity,1) over ... is 'Create Order' and lead(activity,2) is 'Confirm Order'.

Alternatively, using LAG but similar idea. So when an event's previous two are in that sequence.

Wait, perhaps create a query where for each case_id we assign row numbers ordered by timestamp, then look for three consecutive rows with those specific activities.

But the problem states they must be in direct succession, so no other events between them. So if there are any other activity between 'Approve' and 'Create', that would break the sequence.

So maybe using LEAD function:

For each row where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check if the next event (lead 1) in same case_id is 'Create Order' and then lead 2 is 'Confirm Order'.

Then collect all such case_ids. So we can select distinct case_ids from that.

But how to implement this?

Alternatively, using a self-join approach where for each case_id, find an event e1 (Approve), e2 next which is Create, e3 next which is Confirm.

So maybe:

SELECT
    e1.case_id,
    ...
FROM event_log e1
JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
JOIN event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'

But how to ensure that there are no other events between them? Because if a case has more than three events, the joins might pick up any sequence where those three exist in order but with gaps. Hmm.

Alternatively, using window functions. For each row, look at the next two activities. If for a given case_id and ordered by timestamp, there's a point where activity is 'Approve', followed by 'Create Order' then 'Confirm Order'.

So:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act
    FROM event_log
)
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND next_act = 'Create Order'
AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order';

Yes, this would work. Because for each row in the event log where there's an Approve followed by Create and Confirm as the next two events, that case is selected.

So step 1: Find all cases with at least one occurrence of these three activities consecutively. That gives us a list of case_ids to consider.

Then step 2: Among those cases, further filter down to those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' (which are consecutive) is more than 5 days.

So for each such sequence in a case_id, find the Create event's timestamp and Confirm event's timestamp. Compute their difference, if it exceeds 5 days then include that case_id into exclusion list.

How to get those timestamps? Well, perhaps using another window approach. For cases where we have the three activities consecutively, for each of these sequences in a case (since there might be multiple such sequences), but I think per problem statement, if any sequence exists with more than 5 days between Create and Confirm, then exclude that case.

So how to get those timestamps?

In addition to finding the three consecutive events, we can also retrieve their respective timestamps. So in the first step (using window functions):

SELECT
    case_id,
    timestamp as approve_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (... ) as create_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (... ) as confirm_ts

Then for cases where activity is 'Approve...', and next two are Create and Confirm. Then compute (confirm_ts - create_ts) > interval 5 days.

So expanding the subquery:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp as current_timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
)
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND next_act = 'Create Order'
AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAYS;

Wait, but in DuckDB, how to handle date differences? The timestamp is a datetime. So the difference between two timestamps would be in days perhaps.

But assuming that next_timestamp and next_next_timestamp are from 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', their difference must be greater than 5 days.

So (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > interval 5 days: so check if this time delta is more than 5 days. In DuckDB, to get the interval between two dates as a duration, we can use date_part or similar functions.

Wait, perhaps using DATEDIFF function? Like:

DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) >5

Yes. Because Create is followed by Confirm, so create_ts is earlier than confirm_ts, and the difference between them should be more than 5 days.

So incorporating that into the query: DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) >5 would give true if the duration exceeds 5 days.

Thus, putting it all together:

First part of the problem is to identify case_ids which have at least one sequence where those three activities are consecutive and also the time between Create and Confirm is over five days. Then exclude such cases from the final result.

So now we need to generate a list of case_ids that meet both criteria, then select all events not in these case_ids.

The challenge here is to first find all such case_ids efficiently, possibly using subqueries or CTEs.

Once I have those case_ids, the main query will be:

SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN ( ... )

So putting it together. Let's structure this with a Common Table Expression (CTE) for readability.

WITH excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e.case_id
    FROM (
        -- The subquery to find sequences and time condition
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
        FROM event_log
    ) e
    WHERE e.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e.next_act = 'Create Order'
      AND e.next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
      AND DATEDIFF('day', create_ts, confirm_ts) >5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases);

Wait, but wait: in the subquery above, when we partition by case_id and order by timestamp, for each row where activity is 'Approve...', then next act should be Create Order. But if there's a different sequence elsewhere in the same case, maybe? For example, the first three events are correct, but another set of these activities later.

But I think even with multiple sequences in one case, as long as any such sequence meets both criteria (sequence and time), then that case_id is included in excluded_cases. So it's okay to find all cases where at least once this happens.

Thus the query should work.

Testing:

Let me check step by step.

In the CTE:excluded_cases, we process each event in a case ordered by timestamp. For each row (which could be any activity), look ahead two steps. If current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next_act is Create Order, and next_next_act is Confirm Order, then check if the time between create_ts (next_timestamp) and confirm_ts (after that) is more than 5 days.

Then distinct case_id selected because a single occurrence would suffice to exclude the entire case. So yes.

So when these conditions are met for any such trio of events in the same case, the case is added to excluded_cases.

The main query then selects all event_log entries where case_id is not in this list.

But does DuckDB allow using DATEDIFF? Let me confirm the syntax: according to DuckDB's documentation, yes. DATEDIFF function exists and can compute day difference between two timestamps.

Also, LEAD functions are available with PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clauses.

Therefore, this approach should work.

Potential edge cases:

1. A case has multiple sequences of these three activities. If at least one sequence meets the time condition, then exclude all events from that case.
2. The same activity occurs in different orders but not consecutive: no problem because we are only looking for exact consecutive sequence.
3. Timestamps with NULLs? But timestamp is a column here; assuming they are non-null since it's an event log.

Another thing to consider: the ordering within the window function (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp). That's correct, as events must be ordered by their timestamps for the sequence check.

So this query should correctly identify all cases that have at least one such trio of consecutive activities with time between Create and Confirm over 5 days. Then exclude them from the results.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to filter out specific cases (`case_id`) from an event log based on two criteria: a sequence of three consecutive activities and a timing condition between two of those activities. The final result should include all events except those from cases that meet both criteria.

### Approach
1. **Identify Cases with the Specific Sequence**: We need to find cases where the activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' occur consecutively without any intervening events.
2. **Check Timing Condition**: Among these cases, we further filter those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events exceeds 5 days.
3. **Exclude Cases Meeting Both Criteria**: Finally, exclude all events from these identified cases from the result set.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        e.case_id 
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
        FROM 
            event_log
    ) e
    WHERE 
        e.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND e.next_act = 'Create Order'
        AND e.next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
        AND DATEDIFF('day', e.create_ts, e.confirm_ts) > 5
)
SELECT 
    * 
FROM 
    event_log 
WHERE 
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases);
```

### Explanation
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `excluded_cases`**:
   - This CTE identifies cases that meet both the sequence and timing conditions.
   - Using window functions (`LEAD`), we check for consecutive activities ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order') within each case ordered by timestamp.
   - The `DATEDIFF` function is used to calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. If this difference exceeds 5 days, the case is included in the exclusion list.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Selects all events from the `event_log` table excluding those cases identified in the `excluded_cases` CTE.
   - The result set includes only events from cases that do not meet both the specified sequence and timing conditions, thus ensuring compliance with the problem requirements.

This approach efficiently filters out undesired cases using window functions for sequence detection and date arithmetic to enforce the timing constraint.
