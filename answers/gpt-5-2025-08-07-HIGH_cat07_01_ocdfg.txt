Here’s what the visualization shows:

- What it is: An objectcentric process map that combines procuretopay, ordertocash, and returns. Activities are boxes; Start/End are ovals. Arrows show the flow between activities, annotated with typical delays (e.g., 300–400 ms). Numbers inside boxes are total event counts.

- Object types and colors (shown by the colored dots/links):
  - PurchaseOrderItem (blue, 5.0M objects)
  - SalesOrderItem (orange, 3.5M)
  - PurchaseRequisitionItem (purple, 2.0M)
  - VendorInvoiceItem (green, 1.2M)
  - ReturnOrderItem (red, 0.8M)

- Main flows and volumes:
  - Requisition branch (center/left): Start  Create Requisition  Approve Requisition (Overall ~5.7M). From there, cases split to Send Order (5.2M) and Check Stock (1.0M), and also toward Approve Payment (1.5M)  Create Invoice (2.0M).
  - Sales fulfillment branch (right): Start  Create Order (8.5M)  Pack Goods (2.0M)  Ship Goods (1.8M)  Confirm Delivery (1.7M)  Close Order (1.7M).
  - Returns branch (centerright): Process Return (0.8M) connects around Approve Requisition and interacts with Confirm Delivery and invoicing/payment.
  - Multiple End nodes indicate different termination points across branches.

- Timing cues:
  - Edges carry delays such as 300–400 ms between early steps, ~200–350 ms across logistics steps, up to ~800 ms into Approve Payment, and as low as ~10 ms around returns.

Overall, the chart summarizes how five related object types move through requisitioning, ordering, fulfillment, invoicing/payment, and returns, showing both the volumes per activity and the typical time between them.
