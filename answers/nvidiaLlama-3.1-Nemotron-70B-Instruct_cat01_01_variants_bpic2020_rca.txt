Analyzing the provided process variants with their frequencies and performances, we can identify potential root causes for performance issues specific to this process and data. Keep in mind that without additional contextual information (e.g., task durations, resource utilization, or specific performance metrics like wait times, processing times, etc.), the analysis will focus on observable patterns within the data:

### 1. **Rejection and Re-submission Loops**
- **Observation**: Variants with higher performance (i.e., longer processing times) often involve rejection and re-submission loops (e.g., `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE ->...` repeated sequences).
- **Root Cause**: Inefficient approval/rejection handling leading to prolonged process lifecycles. Each rejection and subsequent re-submission significantly increases the overall process time.
- **Actionable Insight**: Streamline approval processes, improve initial submission quality, or implement more efficient rejection feedback loops to reduce re-submissions.

### 2. **Additional Approval Steps**
- **Observation**: Variants requiring approvals from multiple stakeholders (e.g., `ADMINISTRATION` followed by `BUDGET OWNER` before `SUPERVISOR`) tend to have higher performances (longer times).
- **Root Cause**: Increased dependency on multiple approvals can introduce waiting times and bottlenecks, especially if these stakeholders have limited availability or capacity.
- **Actionable Insight**: Analyze if all approval steps are necessary. Consider parallel approvals where possible, or ensure that approvers have sufficient resources and incentives to respond promptly.

### 3. **Pre-Approval vs. Final Approval Efficiency**
- **Observation**: Variants involving `PRE_APPROVER` roles sometimes exhibit high performance metrics, similar to those with multiple approval stages.
- **Root Cause**: Potential inefficiency in the pre-approval stage, leading to delays similar to those seen with multi-step approvals.
- **Actionable Insight**: Examine the pre-approval process for bottlenecks. Ensure that pre-approvers have clear guidelines and sufficient support to make timely decisions.

### 4. **Missing or Incomplete Information**
- **Observation**: The presence of `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` in some variants with high performance metrics.
- **Root Cause**: Delays due to awaiting or resolving missing information, indicating potential issues with initial submission completeness or communication breakdowns.
- **Actionable Insight**: Enhance the submission process to ensure completeness (e.g., mandatory fields, clearer guidelines). Implement a more efficient process for handling missing information.

### 5. **Frequency vs. Performance**
- **Observation**: There is not a direct inverse correlation between frequency and performance, suggesting that high-frequency variants do not always have the lowest performances (times).
- **Root Cause**: This might indicate that the frequency of a variant does not directly dictate its efficiency, pointing to task-specific or resource-related bottlenecks.
- **Actionable Insight**: For high-frequency variants with unexpectedly high performances, delve into task durations, resource allocation, and potential for process optimization despite (or because of) their high frequency.

### Next Steps:
1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: For each identified root cause, conduct a detailed analysis to quantify the impact.
2. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Engage with process participants to validate findings and gather insights on potential solutions.
3. **Simulation and Modeling**: Use process simulation tools to test the impact of proposed changes before implementation.
4. **Pilot Implementations**: Roll out changes in a controlled environment to measure effectiveness and make adjustments as needed.
5. **Monitor and Evaluate**: Continuously assess the process post-changes to ensure that the desired performance improvements are sustained.
