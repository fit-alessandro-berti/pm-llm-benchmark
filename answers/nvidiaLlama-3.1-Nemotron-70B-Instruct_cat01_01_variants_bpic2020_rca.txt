Analyzing the provided process variants with their frequencies and performances, we can identify some potential root causes for performance issues specific to this process and data. Please note, without additional context (e.g., what each step entails, resource availability, and specific performance metrics like wait times, execution times, etc.), these insights are based on the patterns and anomalies observed within the provided data.

### 1. **Rejection and Re-submission Loops**
- **Observation**: Variants with higher frequencies of rejection (by ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, or BUDGET OWNER) followed by re-submission show significantly higher performance times (e.g., frequencies 5, 6, 11, 29, 36).
- **Potential Root Cause**: The iterative process of rejection and re-submission indicates potential issues with the initial submission quality, approval criteria clarity, or a lack of upfront validation. This back-and-forth increases the overall process time.
- **Actionable Insight**: Enhance submission guidelines, implement stricter upfront validation, or provide more detailed feedback upon rejection to reduce re-submission rates.

### 2. **Approval by BUDGET OWNER Adds Complexity**
- **Observation**: Process variants that include "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" before final approval by SUPERVISOR generally show higher performance times (e.g., frequencies 2, 6, 10, 29) compared to those without this step (e.g., frequency 1).
- **Potential Root Cause**: The additional approval layer might introduce delays due to the BUDGET OWNER's availability, the complexity of budget approvals, or stringent budget controls.
- **Actionable Insight**: Assess the necessity of this approval step for all cases. Consider streamlining the budget approval process or providing more resources/support to the BUDGET OWNER to expedite decisions.

### 3. **Direct Final Approval by SUPERVISOR**
- **Observation**: The variant where the declaration is directly "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" after submission (frequency 3) shows a relatively lower performance time compared to most other variants with additional approval steps.
- **Potential Root Cause**: This suggests that minimizing approval layers, when feasible, can significantly reduce overall process time.
- **Actionable Insight**: Identify scenarios where direct final approval by SUPERVISOR is feasible without compromising process integrity, and implement a streamlined process for such cases.

### 4. **Missing Approvals and Re-submissions**
- **Observation**: Variants involving "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" followed by re-submission (frequencies 10, 21, and notably 7 with a very high performance time) indicate potential systemic or communication issues.
- **Potential Root Cause**: The "MISSING" approval step rejection might point to a lack of clarity in the process, inadequate resource allocation, or technical glitches leading to a "missing" status.
- **Actionable Insight**: Investigate the "MISSING" approval instances to determine the root cause (technical, communicational, or procedural) and rectify it to prevent unnecessary delays.

### 5. **High Performance Times for Infrequent Variants**
- **Observation**: Some low-frequency variants (e.g., frequencies 4, 7, 35, and especially 25 with "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION") exhibit exceptionally high performance times.
- **Potential Root Cause**: These might indicate edge cases with unique challenges or a lack of optimized handling procedures for less common process paths.
- **Actionable Insight**: Even though these occur less frequently, their significant impact on performance warrants specific investigation to ensure that the process can efficiently handle all plausible scenarios.

**Next Steps**:
- **Detailed Investigation**: For each identified area, conduct in-depth analyses involving stakeholders, process owners, and potentially, targeted surveys to validate these insights.
- **Pilot Interventions**: Based on the actionable insights, design and implement pilot projects to test the effectiveness of proposed solutions before scaling up.
- **Monitoring and Feedback Loop**: Establish a monitoring system to track the impact of changes and maintain a feedback loop to continuously refine the process.
