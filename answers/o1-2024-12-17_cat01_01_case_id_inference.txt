**Reasoning Process:**

1. Each patient case typically begins with a "Register patient" event and ends with a "Patient discharged" event.
2. Patients can be distinguished by a combination of consistent attributes across events: patient_age, patient_gender, and the logical sequence of their clinical journey.
3. The events for different patients are interleaved, but by comparing the attributes and the flow of activities (e.g., triage → consultation → diagnostics → treatment → discharge), we can separate them.

Let's go through the events step-by-step:

- **Event 1:** "Register patient" in ER for a 45-year-old male.  
  - Let's call this **Case #1**.  
  Patient attributes: 45 M, in ER.

- **Event 2:** Another "Register patient" in ER, this time a 62-year-old female.  
  - This must be a new patient since the attributes differ. This is **Case #2**.  
  Patient attributes: 62 F, in ER.

- **Event 3:** "Register patient" in Surgery, a 28-year-old male.  
  - Different age/gender/department start from the previous ones, so it's a new case. This is **Case #3**.  
  Patient attributes: 28 M, in Surgery.

Now we have three ongoing cases:
- Case #1: 45 M (ER)
- Case #2: 62 F (ER)
- Case #3: 28 M (Surgery)

Continue matching events to these cases based on attributes and logical flow:

- **Event 4:** "Initial triage" in ER, 45 M.  
  Matches Case #1 (45 M, ER).

- **Event 5:** "Initial triage" in ER, 62 F.  
  Matches Case #2 (62 F, ER).

- **Event 6:** "Doctor consultation" in Surgery, 28 M.  
  Matches Case #3 (28 M, Surgery).

- **Event 7:** "X-ray imaging" in Radiology, 45 M.  
  Patient matches Case #1 again.

- **Event 8:** "Lab test requested" in ER, 62 F.  
  Matches Case #2.

- **Event 9:** "Surgery preparation" in Surgery, 28 M.  
  Matches Case #3.

- **Event 10:** "Lab test completed" in Laboratory, 62 F.  
  Matches Case #2.

- **Event 11:** "Doctor consultation" in ER, 62 F.  
  Matches Case #2 again.

- **Event 12:** "Doctor consultation" in ER, 45 M.  
  Matches Case #1.

- **Event 13:** "Surgery performed" in Surgery, 28 M.  
  Matches Case #3.

- **Event 14:** "Prescription created" in ER, 62 F.  
  Matches Case #2.

- **Event 15:** "Patient discharged" in ER, 45 M.  
  This concludes Case #1.

- **Event 16:** "Recovery room" in Surgery, 28 M.  
  Matches Case #3.

- **Event 17:** "Patient discharged" in ER, 62 F.  
  Concludes Case #2.

- **Event 18:** "Patient discharged" in Surgery, 28 M.  
  Concludes Case #3.

**Final Groupings:**

- **Case #1 (45-year-old Male, ER):**  
  Events: 1 (register), 4 (initial triage), 7 (X-ray imaging), 12 (doctor consultation), 15 (patient discharged)

- **Case #2 (62-year-old Female, ER):**  
  Events: 2 (register), 5 (initial triage), 8 (lab test requested), 10 (lab test completed), 11 (doctor consultation), 14 (prescription created), 17 (patient discharged)

- **Case #3 (28-year-old Male, Surgery):**  
  Events: 3 (register), 6 (doctor consultation), 9 (surgery preparation), 13 (surgery performed), 16 (recovery room), 18 (patient discharged)

These assignments maintain consistent patient attributes and follow a logical medical workflow.
