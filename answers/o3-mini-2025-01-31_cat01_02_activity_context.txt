Below is one way to disambiguate the activities by renaming the recurring ones so that their context is evident. Note that only those activities that appear more than once with different roles in a case (or across similar cases) were adjusted. The changes are driven by clues in the Additional Context field. For example, when “Verify Documents” occurs the first time it is an initial check, and the later occurrence is a recheck after additional material is provided. Similarly, “Call Customer” gets a qualifier that indicates why the customer is being called.

Justification for Naming Choices:
1. “Verify Documents”  Split into “Initial Document Verification” and “Re-Verification After Additional Documents” (or “Initial In-Person Document Verification” and “Post-Adjustment Document Re-verification” for the branch case) because the first check is the primary assessment and the subsequent one is done after extra information is provided.
2. “Call Customer”  Expanded to “Call Customer for Missing Documents,” “Initial Customer Call for Account Discrepancy,” “Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments,” and “Call Customer to Return to Branch” to clarify the purpose of each call (requesting documents, clarification of discrepancies, confirmation after adjustments, or retrieving a walk-in customer).
3. “Submit Additional”  Changed to “Submit Additional Documents” to clearly indicate what is being submitted.
4. “Adjust Account”  Adjusted to “Adjust Account Details” or “Internal Account Correction” so the activity purpose is explicit.
5. “Initiate Request”  For the branch case, it is renamed “In-Person Request Initiation at Branch” to highlight the channel difference.

These renaming choices are based on the contextual clues (such as who performs the action, when it occurs, and what additional information is given) and help in mapping out the process flow more transparently.
