### **Exception Handling & Variations**

- **Missing PO Number:**  
  - Invoice returned to Supplier for more details. Supplier Relationship Manager may assist for key vendors.
  - For informal service contracts, AP Supervisor may work with department head to create a retrospective PO or make reject decision.

- **Discrepancies (Prices, Quantities, Missing/Extra Items):**  
  - Resolution attempted between AP Clerk and Purchasing Officer; Supplier may be contacted for corrections (Supplier Relationship Manager often assists).
  - For persistent/unresolvable issues, AP Supervisor steps in to coordinate across departments and with Supplier.

- **Manager Rejection:**  
  - Usually due to suspicious totals or items outside budget. Trigger investigation by AP Clerk and, if needed, escalation.

- **Loopbacks:**  
  - After exception resolution, Invoice resumes at appropriate earlier step (as clarified in the gateways).

- **Ambiguity Note:**  
  - The handoff after discrepancy resolution may cycle through clarifications and escalations multiple times before process proceeds.
