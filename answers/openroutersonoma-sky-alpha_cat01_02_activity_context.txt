### Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities

Below is the revised version of the event log. I have kept the structure similar to the original (separate tables per case for clarity), but renamed the activities that appear multiple times within the same case (or have recurring names across cases with varying contexts) to disambiguate them. Non-recurring activities (e.g., Initiate Request, Submit Additional, Adjust Account, Approve Request) remain unchanged, as they do not recur within cases and have consistent meanings. For recurring activities:

- **Verify Documents** (recurs in C001 and C003): Renamed based on sequence and purpose (initial vs. follow-up after an update).
- **Call Customer** (recurs in C002; appears once in others but with distinct purposes): Renamed based on the specific intent derived from the additional context, to highlight differences even in single-occurrence cases.

The timestamps, resources, and additional context remain unchanged for fidelity to the original log.

### Justification of Naming Choices

1. **Verify Documents (recurs in C001 and C003)**:
   - Renamed to "Initial Verify Documents" for the first occurrence in each case. **Contextual clues**: This is always the immediate post-initiation step focused on primary identity or physical checks (e.g., "Agent checks identity documents" in C001; "Physical verification of ID" in C003; "Identity verification" in C002, where it appears only once). It reflects the starting verification without prior updates.
   - Renamed to "Follow-up Verify Documents" for the second occurrence. **Contextual clues**: This happens after an intervening action (e.g., additional document submission in C001 or account adjustment in C003), emphasizing re-checking based on new information ("Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided"; "Re-verify docs after account adjustment"). This disambiguates it from the initial check by highlighting the iterative, update-dependent nature.

2. **Call Customer (recurs in C002; appears once in C001 and C003)**:
   - Renamed to "Call to Request Missing Documents" in C001. **Contextual clues**: The call addresses incomplete verification and specifically requests docs ("Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs"), distinguishing it as a proactive outreach for supplementation.
   - Renamed to "Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy" for the first occurrence in C002. **Contextual clues**: This is an outbound call tied to resolving a specific issue ("Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy"), positioning it as diagnostic rather than confirmatory.
   - Renamed to "Call to Confirm Adjustments" for the second occurrence in C002. **Contextual clues**: This follows an adjustment and verifies changes ("Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made"), making it a closure-oriented follow-up, distinct from the initial clarification call.
   - Renamed to "Call to Recall Customer" in C003. **Contextual clues**: The call is logistical, prompted by the customer leaving temporarily ("Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return"), differentiating it as a retention/recall action rather than content-related clarification.

These renames ensure that activity names are self-descriptive, reducing ambiguity in process mining or analysis by embedding positional (e.g., initial vs. follow-up) and purpose-driven (e.g., request vs. clarify) details from the additional context. This highlights workflow variations, such as iterative verification loops or multi-purpose customer interactions, without altering the log's factual content.
