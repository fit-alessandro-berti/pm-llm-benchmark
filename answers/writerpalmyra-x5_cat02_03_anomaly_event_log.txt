After reviewing the provided Procure-to-Pay (P2P) event log, several **anomalous sequences** stand out across Cases **1002**, **1003**, and **1004**. While Case 1001 follows a standard and logical P2P flow, the others exhibit clear deviations from best practices in procurement process governance, control, and risk management.

---

###  **Case 1002 – Critical Order Violations & Control Failures**
Key anomalies:
- **“Issue Purchase Order” occurs before “Approve Purchase Requisition”**
  - Timestamp: Issue PO (2024-02-01 08:40)  Approve Requisition (2024-02-03 08:00)
- **Payment is released before goods are received and before invoice matching**
  - “Release Payment” at 2024-02-03 07:15 — **before** receiving goods (02-04), invoice matching (02-05), and even requisition approval (02-03 08:00, just 30 minutes later)

 **Why this is problematic:**
1. **Bypassing approval controls** undermines budgetary governance — purchase orders should only be issued after formal approval of the need.
2. **Paying before receiving goods** creates **significant financial risk** — the company pays without verifying delivery or quality, opening doors to fraud or supplier errors.
3. The payment was released **before the invoice was even matched to the PO**, violating the three-way match principle (PO, goods receipt, invoice). This weakens audit trails and increases overpayment risk.

 This case suggests **process circumvention** or a **system error**, possibly indicating urgent or manual overrides used inappropriately.

###  **Case 1003 – Dangerous Premature Payment**
Key anomaly:
- **Payment released on 2024-02-08** — **before**:
  - Vendor invoice received (02-09)
  - Goods received (02-10)
  - Invoice matched to PO (02-11)

 **Why this is problematic:**
- Paying **before receiving the invoice or goods** is a **severe control failure**.
- There is **no basis for payment** — no verification of amount owed, quantity delivered, or price accuracy.
- This could indicate **fraud**, **duplicate payments**, or a **major system misconfiguration**.

 This is one of the most red-flagged behaviors in P2P: **payment without supporting documentation or delivery confirmation**.

---

###  **Case 1004 – Misordered Process Steps**
Key anomaly:
- **Goods are received before the Purchase Order is issued**
  - Receive Goods: 2024-02-06 09:00
  - Issue PO: 2024-02-06 09:15

 **Why this is problematic:**
- Receiving goods **before issuing a PO** means the supplier delivered without a formal, agreed-upon contract.
- This makes it difficult to **verify pricing, terms, or quantities** — increasing dispute risk.
- It may lead to **maverick spending** and weak supplier management.
- While sometimes seen in emergency scenarios, it should be rare and require justification.

 This indicates **poor planning or reactive procurement**, undermining procurement efficiency and compliance.

---

###  Case 1001 – Normal & Healthy Flow
- Follows ideal P2P sequence:
  - Requisition  Approval  PO  Goods Receipt  Invoice Receipt  Match  Payment  Close
- All steps occur in logical order with reasonable timing.
- Represents **best practice**.

###  Summary of Anomalies and Risks

| Case | Anomaly | Risk Type | Business Impact |
|------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1002 | PO issued before approval; Payment before receipt & matching | Control failure, fraud risk | Financial loss, audit failure |
| 1003 | Payment released before invoice, goods, or matching | Severe process violation | High fraud risk, accounting errors |
| 1004 | Goods received before PO issued | Process misordering | Maverick spend, supplier disputes |

---

###  Recommendations:
1. **Enforce system controls** to prevent PO issuance and payment without prior approvals and document matching.
2. **Flag cases** where payment occurs before goods receipt or invoice matching for audit.
3. **Investigate overrides** in Cases 1002 and 1003 — were these emergency purchases? Were proper justifications documented?
4. **Train procurement and AP teams** on the importance of process sequence and the three-way match.
