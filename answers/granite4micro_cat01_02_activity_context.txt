To address this task, we need to identify which activity occurs more than once within each case, then determine how these occurrences are distinguished by context or additional actions before and after them. We will rename these activities accordingly.

### Activity Identification

- **Initiate Request**: Appears multiple times across all cases with different contexts (e.g., submitted via online portal vs. walk-in at branch). 
  - Renaming: This activity remains as is because it serves a clear, consistent purpose across the process regardless of context.

- **Verify Documents**: Appears multiple times within each case to check identity documents or verify account documentation.
  - Contextual Variations:
    - First verification might be for ID authenticity (before customer calls).
    - Second verification could occur after additional information is provided (e.g., a document scan, account adjustment).

- **Call Customer**: Appears twice in each case with different reasons: initially to request missing documents or follow-up to confirm adjustments.
  - Renaming:
    - Initial Call for Missing Docs: "Request Missing Documents Call"
    - Follow-Up Call: "Confirm Adjustments"

- **Submit Additional**: Similar to the first verification of documents but specifically related to submitting additional information like ID scans.
  - Renaming: This becomes "Submit Additional Information."

### Justification for Naming Choices

- **Request Missing Documents Call**: Renamed to highlight the specific reason for the call, which is to gather missing documents.
- **Confirm Adjustments**: The follow-up action was renamed to reflect its purpose of confirming any changes made during account adjustments.

These renaming decisions aim to clarify each activity's role within the process and differentiate them based on their subsequent actions or reasons. This helps in understanding how these activities fit into the broader workflow without ambiguity.
