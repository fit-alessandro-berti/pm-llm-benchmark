# DuckDB SQL Query for Top K Process Variants

To accomplish this task, I'll create a DuckDB SQL query that extracts the ordered sequence of activities for each case, identifies unique process variants, counts their frequency, and returns events belonging only to the top K variants.

```sql
WITH case_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM 
        case_activities
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
    ORDER BY 
        case_count DESC
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM 
        variant_counts
    LIMIT K  -- Replace K with the actual value, e.g., 5 for the top 5 variants
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        ca.case_id
    FROM 
        case_activities ca
    JOIN 
        top_k_variants tkv ON ca.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
)
SELECT 
    e.*
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    top_cases tc ON e.case_id = tc.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.case_id, e.timestamp
```

## Explanation:

1. **First CTE (case_activities)**:
   - For each case, it extracts the sequence of activities ordered by timestamp
   - The `string_agg` function concatenates the activities into a comma-separated string while preserving the temporal order

2. **Second CTE (variant_counts)**:
   - Groups cases by their activity sequence
   - Counts how many cases follow each unique sequence pattern
   - Orders variants by frequency (descending)

3. **Third CTE (top_k_variants)**:
   - Selects the top K variants based on their frequency
   - The 'K' should be replaced with the actual number (e.g., 3, 5, 10)

4. **Fourth CTE (top_cases)**:
   - Identifies all case IDs that belong to one of the top K variants

5. **Final query**:
   - Joins the original event log with the filtered top cases
   - Returns all events from cases that follow one of the top K variants
   - Orders results by case_id and timestamp to maintain the process flow

Note that this implementation handles cases with repeated activities correctly, as the ordered sequence preserves all occurrences of activities according to their timestamps.
