To identify unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group based on the provided process variants, let's analyze each aspect:

### Process Variants Frequency Analysis

1. **Higher Denial Rate in Protected Group:**
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of loan denials compared to sign-offs for agreements.
   - Specifically, variants ending with "Loan Denied" are more frequent and numerically dominant in the protected group (e.g., `960` instances vs `31` instances for successful sign-offs).
   
2. **Lower Successful Outcome Frequency:**
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of successful outcomes like signing loan agreements (`1856` total) compared to the protected group (`74` total).

### Process Variants Performance Analysis

- **Application Rejection and Appointment Denial Times:** 
  - Both groups experience similar initial rejections but with slightly different timings:
    - Protected: `90,000.623`
    - Unprotected: `80,000.108`

- **Extended Process Delays for the Protected Group:**
  - The protected group shows a more complex and extended path to rejection or denial (often involving multiple steps like visits for collateral assessment).
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied [Performance = 349,977.30]
    ```
    This variant is observed more frequently in the protected group compared to similar variants in the unprotected group.

- **Multiple Visits for Collateral Assessment:**
  - The protected group undergoes multiple visits for collateral assessment before denial (`Make Visit to Assess Collateral` repeated), suggesting a stricter scrutiny.
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied [Performance = 369,971.64]
    ```

### Summary of Differences

- **Higher Rejection Rates:** The protected group has a higher frequency of application rejections and loan denials compared to the unprotected group.
  
- **Complexity and Delays in Processes:**
  - Protected group often experiences more complex sequences with multiple steps before denial, indicating potential biases or discriminatory practices that add unnecessary burdens.
  - For instance, the need for repeated collateral assessments could be an indicator of increased scrutiny or bias.

### Conclusion

The main differences highlight a disparity where the protected group faces higher rejection rates and more intricate, time-consuming processes compared to the unprotected group. This suggests possible unfair treatment in the loan application process, warranting further investigation into these systemic discrepancies.
