I知 considering adding several constraints like "RequestAdditionalInfo," "ManualReview," and "FinalDecision," possibly adding a "BiasMitigationCheck." I need to be careful not to step outside DECLARE semantics. Ensuring fairness is key! For any decision involving sensitive applicants, I want to require "ManualReview" to always be present in the trace. This means I should add a coexistence constraint that ensures both "FinalDecision" and "ManualReview" coexist. I値l also need to use "altsuccession" for additional constraints to avoid bias.

I'm thinking about avoiding chained "FinalDecision" right after "CheckApplicantRace" without "BiasMitigationCheck" in between. A "nonchainsuccession" from "CheckApplicantRace" to "FinalDecision" seems like the perfect solution. The idea is to ensure that if there's a chain of two events, it can't go from the sensitive attribute to the decision event directly. It痴 important to follow the requirement about not having immediate succession without checks. I believe the distinction between "chain" and "normal succession" here could be key.

I'm diving into DECLARE, focusing on how "chain_succession" requires an event A to be directly followed by B. On the other hand, "succession" allows for any event in between them. The "nonchainsuccession" constraint ensures that A can't directly precede B, but it can still precede it if another event is in the mix. This gives me a way to prevent immediate transitions from "CheckApplicantRace" to "Reject" or "Approve." Plus, it's essential to require "ManualReview" to coexist with "FinalDecision" for sensitive demographics.

I realize the "coexist" constraint might not be specific enough to sensitive activities like "Approve_Minority" since DECLARE uses specific activity tokens. If I'm not using data-aware variables, I could add tokens like "Approve_Minority" or "Reject_Minority." However, I should introduce "DecisionStep_Minority" instead. I might also consider using "altcoexistence" or "responded_existence" to ensure that if "FinalDecision" happens for minority applicants, "ManualReview" must also occur. This way, we can effectively enforce the needed processes in my model.

I'm outlining constraints for the model, starting with ensuring that any sensitive activities like "CheckApplicantRace" or "CheckApplicantAge" have "ManualReview" coexist with them. I need to add unary existence constraints for new activities and some binary response constraints to prevent direct transitions to "FinalDecision." Specifically, I値l introduce "nonchainsuccession" to ensure that "BiasMitigationCheck" happens between sensitive checks and decisions. Finally, I want to solidify coexistence and existence relationships to avoid bias and enhance fairness in the loan process. This will create a robust framework.

I知 outlining constraints to ensure fairness and mitigate bias in the process. I値l add "existence" and "coexistence" constraints for "BiasMitigationCheck," ensuring it coexists with "CheckApplicantRace." For every sensitive activity, like "Approve_Minority," "ManualReview" must also exist. I知 planning to include a "response" constraint that guarantees a "BiasMitigationCheck" follows any sensitive checks. This structure aims to prevent immediate decision events following sensitive checks, ensuring a fair process throughout. Finally, I want to document my additions clearly.

I知 adding a "nonchainsuccession" constraint to prevent sensitive checks from directly leading to decisions. This means if a sensitive check occurs, there must be at least one other event in between before any decision is made. I値l also set up a "coexistence" constraint between "CheckApplicantRace" and "ManualReview" to ensure that any sensitive check triggers a manual review for fairness. I want to emphasize these changes help maintain a structured and fair decision-making process overall.

I知 adding several constraints to ensure fairness in the decision-making process. Firstly, I値l establish existence constraints for "ManualReview" and "BiasMitigationCheck". Next, I値l implement coexistence rules so that these checks occur together with sensitive checks, like "CheckApplicantRace." There will also be response and precedence constraints ensuring any sensitive checks trigger necessary reviews. Finally, I値l incorporate non-succession rules to prevent direct decisions right after sensitive activities, which enhances the overall fairness of the process.

I'm working on updating the 'declare_model' by adding several constraints to ensure fairness in decision-making. For instance, I'll include existence constraints for "ManualReview" and "BiasMitigationCheck" to guarantee they appear in every trace. Next, I値l implement coexistence rules to ensure these checks coexist with sensitive checks, and I'll set response and precedence constraints for appropriate activity flows. Additionally, I'll incorporate non-succession and nonchainsuccession rules to prevent biased decisions right after sensitive activities. Finally, I値l document everything in a clean format.

## Rationale for added constraints

- Existence of fairness steps:
  - existence for ManualReview and BiasMitigationCheck ensures every application trace includes these checks, providing baseline oversight and bias evaluation.

- Coexistence of sensitive checks with fairness steps:
  - coexistence between CheckApplicantRace/Age/Gender and ManualReview ensures that sensitive-attribute checks are always accompanied by a manual review.
  - coexistence between CheckApplicantRace/Age/Gender and BiasMitigationCheck guarantees that each sensitive check triggers a bias-mitigation review in the same trace.

- Response from sensitive checks to fairness steps:
  - response from CheckApplicantRace/Age/Gender to BiasMitigationCheck enforces that a bias check happens after any sensitive attribute event.
  - response from CheckApplicantRace/Age/Gender to ManualReview enforces that a manual review follows any sensitive attribute event.

- Precedence ensuring decisions occur after fairness:
  - precedence BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision and ManualReview  FinalDecision ensures any final decision is made only after a bias check and manual review.

- Succession tying fairness steps to decisions:
  - succession BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision and ManualReview  FinalDecision bind these fairness steps to the outcome within each trace.

- Blocking immediate, biased decisions:
  - nonchainsuccession prevents FinalDecision from directly following CheckApplicantRace/Age/Gender (no events in between), reducing the chance of immediate biased outcomes and forcing at least one intervening step (e.g., a review or other activity).
  - optionally, nonchainsuccession also blocks RequestAdditionalInfo  FinalDecision to avoid hurried approvals/rejections without adequate oversight.
