### Justification of Renaming Choices:

1. **Call Customer**:
   - Renamed to **Follow-up Call for Missing Documents** (C001) to indicate the purpose of the call.
   - Renamed to **Clarification Call** (C002) reflecting its use for clarifying account discrepancies.
   - Renamed to **Return Notification Call** (C003) as it's to notify a customer to return to the branch.
   - Renamed to **Confirmation Call** (C002) to confirm adjustments made after clarification.

2. **Verify Documents**:
   - **Initial Document Verification** and **Final Document Verification** in C001 to signify the progression of verification.
   - Retained as **Initial Document Verification** in other cases where the single verification task was essential.
   - **In-Person Document Verification** in C003 to indicate the physical presence of the customer.
   - **Re-verification of Documents** in C003 to denote the secondary verification after account adjustments.

3. **Submit Additional** (Renamed to **Submit Missing Document** in C001) to better reflect the activity's purpose in the context.

4. **Adjust Account**:
   - Retained in its original form for direct account adjustments (C002 and C003).
   - The difference in context is primarily related to the timing and necessity of the adjustment.

5. **Initiate Request**:
   - Differentiated between initiation channels by renaming to **Initiate Online Request** for online submissions and **Initiate Branch Request** for in-branch submissions.

These renaming choices aim to enhance clarity on the specific roles of activities within the overall process flow, leveraging contextual clues such as the activity's position, the associated resource, and the additional context provided.
