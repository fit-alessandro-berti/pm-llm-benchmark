Based on the provided object-centric event log and directly follows graph, here are some potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

1. **Long duration of certain activities:**
   - "Drive to Terminal" (Truck): The average duration is 10999.07 minutes (~183 hours), which is significantly longer than other activities.
     - Root cause: Long driving distances or inefficient routing could be causing this delay.

   - "Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart" (Container): The average duration is 1007066.16 minutes (~52 days).
     - Root cause: There might be a bottleneck in the process of ordering and receiving empty containers, leading to significant delays.

   - "Book Vehicles" activities for both Vehicle and Transport Document object types have high durations (ranging from 283101.01 minutes to 43935.45 minutes).
     - Root cause: Inefficient vehicle booking processes or resource unavailability could be causing these delays.

2. **High frequency of certain activities with significant duration:**
   - "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" (Container): High frequency (1989) and long average duration (10999.07 minutes).
     - Root cause: This activity might be a bottleneck due to high demand and the time-consuming nature of driving.

   - "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (Container): High frequency (1794) and very long average duration (743380.51 minutes).
     - Root cause: Inefficient stock management or resource allocation could be causing this delay.

3. **High frequency of loops:**
   - "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" (Handling Unit, Truck, Container): High frequencies (ranging from 6 to 1896) and non-negligible durations.
     - Root cause: These loops might indicate inefficiencies in the process, such as unnecessary rework or incorrect routing.

   - "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" (Vehicle, Transport Document): High frequencies (ranging from 585 to 124) and long durations.
     - Root cause: Frequent rebooking of vehicles might indicate a lack of availability or inefficient scheduling.

4. **Low frequency of certain activities with significant duration:**
   - "Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle" (Vehicle): Low frequency (7) but high average duration (152433.14 minutes).
     - Root cause: Although the frequency is low, these delays might still impact overall process performance.

To address these root causes, consider investigating and improving the specific activities mentioned above, as well as optimizing resource allocation, routing, scheduling, and stock management processes.
