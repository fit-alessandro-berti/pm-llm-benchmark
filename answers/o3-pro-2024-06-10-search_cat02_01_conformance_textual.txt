Below is an evaluation of each case against the constraints that can be distilled from the normative description.

Key rules derived from the text  
R1. “Receive order” must be followed by “Check inventory” before anything else.  
R2. When inventory is sufficient (“happy-path” branch):  
Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.  
R3. When inventory is insufficient (“cancellation” branch):  
Receive  Check  Cancel order  Close order.  
R4. Additional cross-cutting constraints  
• Authorize payment may occur only after Check inventory and before Package items.  
• Package items may occur only after Authorize payment and before Ship order.  
• Ship order may occur only after Package items and never after Cancel order.  
• Close order must be the last activity in every case.

Case-by-case assessment

Case 1  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
All activities respect R1–R4.  
 Conforms to the normative process.

Case 2  
Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  
Violation: “Package items” occurs before “Authorize payment,” breaking R2 and R4 (package must follow authorization).  
 Deviates from the normative process.

Case 3  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  
Violations:  
• A cancellation path should not include “Authorize payment” (breaches R3 & R4).  
• “Ship order” occurs after “Cancel order,” directly contradicting R4.  
 Deviates from the normative process.

Case 4  
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
This is exactly the prescribed cancellation branch (R3) and respects all constraints.  
 Conforms to the normative process.

Case 5  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  
Violations:  
• “Package items” is missing; “Ship order” happens without prior packaging, violating R2 & R4.  
• Shipping immediately after authorization skips an obligatory step.  
 Deviates from the normative process.

Summary of non-conforming cases  
• Case 2 – Packaging performed before payment authorization.  
• Case 3 – Payment authorized and shipping performed despite cancellation.  
• Case 5 – Shipping performed without preceding packaging.
