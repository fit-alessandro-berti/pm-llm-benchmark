      'VF' ,                     # Validate Form (first time)
      'AE' ,                     # Assess Eligibility
      * (  tau ,                  # silent “exit” part of the loop
            -> ( 'RMI' , 'VF' )   # Request Missing Info    Validate Form
          ) ,
      'AD' ,                     # Approval Decision
      'SC' ,                     # Send Confirmation
      'AC' )                     # Archive Case

**Explanation of the structure**

| Part | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-> ( … )` | A **sequence** – the activities must occur in the order shown (except for the optional loop). |
| `'RA'  'VF'  'AE'` | The mandatory first three steps that appear in every case. |
| `* ( tau , -> ( 'RMI' , 'VF' ) )` | A **loop**. The first child (`tau`) is a silent step that lets the loop be skipped (i.e., zero repetitions). If the loop is entered, the second child (`-> ( 'RMI' , 'VF' )`) is executed, after which the loop returns to the first child (`tau`). Because the first child does nothing, the loop can be repeated any number of times, producing the pattern *RMI  VF**RMI  VF*… before exiting. This captures the observed repetitions of “Request Missing Info” followed by a revalidation of the form. |
| `'AD'  'SC'  'AC'` | The final mandatory steps: approval, sending the confirmation and archiving the case. |

The tree is **simple** (a single toplevel sequence with one loop), **precise** (it reproduces exactly the traces seen in the log – cases with no missinginfo loop, with one iteration, or with several iterations), and **fit** (all observed traces are accepted by the model).
