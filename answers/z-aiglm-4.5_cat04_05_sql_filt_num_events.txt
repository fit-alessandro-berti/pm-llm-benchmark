To solve this problem, we need to filter out cases (groups of events sharing the same `case_id`) that contain more than six events. The solution involves identifying cases with six or fewer events and returning all events from those cases. Here's the optimized DuckDB SQL query:

```sql
WITH filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING count(*) <= 6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN filtered_cases f ON e.case_id = f.case_id;
```

### Explanation:
1. **CTE (`filtered_cases`)**:
   - Groups events by `case_id` and counts events per case.
   - Uses `HAVING count(*) <= 6` to retain only cases with six or fewer events.

2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins the original `event_log` table with the `filtered_cases` CTE.
   - Returns all columns (`e.*`) for events where the `case_id` exists in `filtered_cases`.

### Key Advantages:
- **Efficiency**: The CTE computes case counts once, avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Clarity**: Explicit separation of case filtering and event retrieval.
- **Correctness**: Guarantees all events from valid cases are returned, regardless of the number of events per case (as long as 6).

### Alternative Approach (Window Function):
While less efficient for large datasets due to per-row computation, this version is also valid:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           count(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
) AS subquery
WHERE event_count <= 6;
```

### Why the CTE/Join Approach is Preferred:
- **Performance**: Aggregates data first (reducing rows) before joining back to the full table.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently by minimizing intermediate data size.
- **Readability**: Clearly separates the filtering logic from the final output selection.
