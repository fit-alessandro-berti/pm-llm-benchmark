We are given an event log for orders and we are to identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors.

 Steps:
 1. Understand the normal process flow:
    Register Order -> Perform Credit Check -> Validate Stock -> Confirm Shipment -> Ship Goods -> Issue Invoice -> Receive Payment

 2. Look at the provided event logs for each case:

    Case 1001: 
        Events: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment.
        This follows the normal flow.

    Case 1002:
        Events: Register Order, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment.
        Anomaly: 
          - Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods happened before Credit Check and Stock Validation.
          - This is out of order.

    Case 1003:
        Events: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Receive Payment.
        Anomaly:
          - Ship Goods happened before Validate Stock and Confirm Shipment? 
          - Actually, Validate Stock is missing? But wait, we have:
            event 16: Credit Check -> event 17: Ship Goods -> event 18: Issue Invoice -> event 19: Confirm Shipment -> event 20: Receive Payment.
          - Missing "Validate Stock" activity? But note: event 17 is Ship Goods and then event 19 is Confirm Shipment? 
          - The normal flow says: Validate Stock -> Confirm Shipment -> Ship Goods.
          - Here, Ship Goods happened before Confirm Shipment? And Validate Stock is missing? 
          - Actually, looking at the events: 
            We have no Validate Stock event. And Confirm Shipment is after Ship Goods? That is reversed.

    Case 1004:
        Events: Register Order, Receive Payment, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods.
        Anomaly:
          - Receive Payment happened right after Register Order and before Issue Invoice? 
          - Also missing Credit Check, Validate Stock? 

 3. We can categorize anomalies:

    a) Missing activities: 
        - Case 1003: Missing Validate Stock? 
        - Case 1004: Missing Credit Check, Validate Stock? 

    b) Out-of-order activities:
        - Case 1002: Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods before Credit Check and Validate Stock.
        - Case 1003: Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment? And also, we have Issue Invoice before Confirm Shipment? 
        - Case 1004: Receive Payment before Issue Invoice? And also before Ship Goods? 

    c) Additional anomalies:
        - Case 1004: Received payment without even issuing an invoice? And without shipping? 

 4. Hypothesize reasons:

    a) Case 1002: 
        - Why would they confirm shipment and ship goods before credit check? 
        - Hypothesis: 
            * The order was marked as "priority" (check orders table: order_type='priority' for case 1002) and they tried to expedite shipping? 
            * But then credit check failed? Actually, credit check was done later and passed (credit_score=650). 
            * Policy violation: shipping before credit check? 

    b) Case 1003:
        - Missing Validate Stock? Why? 
          * Maybe the system didn't require it? Or it was skipped? 
        - Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment? 
          * This is reversed. Normally, shipment should be confirmed before shipping. 
          * Why? Maybe the warehouse clerk shipped without waiting for confirmation? 
        - Also, Confirm Shipment happened after Ship Goods? And after Issue Invoice? 

    c) Case 1004:
        - Receive Payment before Invoice? 
          * Maybe the customer paid in advance? But then why issue an invoice after? 
        - Also, missing activities: Credit Check and Validate Stock? 
          * Why? Maybe it's a trusted customer? Or an error? 

 5. We can also look at the resources and departments:

    Case 1002: 
        - Confirm Shipment by LogisticsMgr_2 and Ship Goods by WarehouseClerk_1: 
          This is in the Logistics department. They performed these steps without waiting for Finance (Credit Check) and Warehouse (Validate Stock)? 

    Case 1003:
        - Ship Goods by WarehouseClerk_3: without Validate Stock? And without Confirm Shipment? 
        - Then later Confirm Shipment by LogisticsMgr_2: which is after shipping? 

    Case 1004:
        - Receive Payment by FinanceTeam_02: without an invoice? 

 6. Propose SQL queries to investigate:

    a) Missing Activities:

        We can check for each case which activities from the standard set are missing.

        Standard activities: 
          'Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment'

        Query to find cases missing at least one of these activities:

        ```sql
        WITH expected_activities AS (
          SELECT unnest(ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment']) AS activity
        ),
        case_activities AS (
          SELECT case_id, activity
          FROM order_event_log
        )
        SELECT DISTINCT ca.case_id
        FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) ca
        CROSS JOIN expected_activities ea
        LEFT JOIN case_activities c 
          ON ca.case_id = c.case_id AND ea.activity = c.activity
        WHERE c.case_id IS NULL;
        ```

        But note: Case 1003 has no 'Validate Stock'. Case 1004 is missing 'Perform Credit Check' and 'Validate Stock'. 

    b) Out-of-order activities:

        We can check the sequence of events. For example, we expect:

          'Perform Credit Check' to come before 'Ship Goods'
          'Validate Stock' to come before 'Ship Goods'
          'Confirm Shipment' to come before 'Ship Goods'
          'Issue Invoice' to come before 'Receive Payment'

        We can check for violations:

        Example: Check for cases where 'Ship Goods' happens before 'Perform Credit Check':

        ```sql
        WITH events AS (
          SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as event_order
          FROM order_event_log
        ),
        credit_check AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as credit_check_time
          FROM events
          WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
        ),
        ship_goods AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as ship_goods_time
          FROM events
          WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
        )
        SELECT s.case_id, s.ship_goods_time, c.credit_check_time
        FROM ship_goods s
        LEFT JOIN credit_check c ON s.case_id = c.case_id
        WHERE s.ship_goods_time < c.credit_check_time OR c.credit_check_time IS NULL;
        ```

        Similarly, for 'Ship Goods' before 'Validate Stock':

        ```sql
        WITH events AS (
          SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as event_order
          FROM order_event_log
        ),
        validate_stock AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as validate_stock_time
          FROM events
          WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock'
        ),
        ship_goods AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as ship_goods_time
          FROM events
          WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
        )
        SELECT s.case_id, s.ship_goods_time, v.validate_stock_time
        FROM ship_goods s
        LEFT JOIN validate_stock v ON s.case_id = v.case_id
        WHERE s.ship_goods_time < v.validate_stock_time OR v.validate_stock_time IS NULL;
        ```

        And for 'Ship Goods' before 'Confirm Shipment':

        ```sql
        WITH events AS (
          SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as event_order
          FROM order_event_log
        ),
        confirm_shipment AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as confirm_shipment_time
          FROM events
          WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
        ),
        ship_goods AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as ship_goods_time
          FROM events
          WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
        )
        SELECT s.case_id, s.ship_goods_time, c.confirm_shipment_time
        FROM ship_goods s
        LEFT JOIN confirm_shipment c ON s.case_id = c.case_id
        WHERE s.ship_goods_time < c.confirm_shipment_time OR c.confirm_shipment_time IS NULL;
        ```

        And for 'Receive Payment' before 'Issue Invoice':

        ```sql
        WITH events AS (
          SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as event_order
          FROM order_event_log
        ),
        issue_invoice AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as issue_invoice_time
          FROM events
          WHERE activity = 'Issue Invoice'
        ),
        receive_payment AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as receive_payment_time
          FROM events
          WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
        )
        SELECT r.case_id, r.receive_payment_time, i.issue_invoice_time
        FROM receive_payment r
        LEFT JOIN issue_invoice i ON r.case_id = i.case_id
        WHERE r.receive_payment_time < i.issue_invoice_time OR i.issue_invoice_time IS NULL;
        ```

    c) Additional investigations:

        - Check if priority orders (from `orders` table) are more likely to have out-of-order or missing steps:

          ```sql
          SELECT 
            o.case_id,
            o.order_type,
            (CASE WHEN oa.missing_activities > 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END) AS has_missing_activities,
            (CASE WHEN oo.out_of_order > 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END) AS has_out_of_order
          FROM orders o
          LEFT JOIN (
            -- For missing activities: count per case
            WITH expected_activities AS (
              SELECT unnest(ARRAY['Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment']) AS activity
            ),
            case_activities AS (
              SELECT case_id, activity
              FROM order_event_log
            ),
            missing_per_case AS (
              SELECT ca.case_id, COUNT(*) AS missing_activities
              FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) ca
              CROSS JOIN expected_activities ea
              LEFT JOIN case_activities c 
                ON ca.case_id = c.case_id AND ea.activity = c.activity
              WHERE c.case_id IS NULL
              GROUP BY ca.case_id
            )
            SELECT case_id, missing_activities
            FROM missing_per_case
          ) oa ON o.case_id = oa.case_id
          LEFT JOIN (
            -- For out-of-order: we define at least one violation? 
            -- We can use a flag if any of the violations above exist.
            WITH violations AS (
              -- Violation 1: Ship Goods before Credit Check
              SELECT s.case_id, 1 AS violation
              FROM ... [one of the above queries] ... 
              UNION
              -- Violation 2: Ship Goods before Validate Stock
              ...
              -- We can do multiple unions, but for simplicity, let's not do a huge union here.
              -- Alternatively, we can create a summary per case by checking each condition.
            )
            SELECT case_id, 1 as out_of_order
            FROM violations
            GROUP BY case_id
          ) oo ON o.case_id = oo.case_id;
          ```

          However, this might be too heavy. Instead, we can run separate queries for priority vs standard.

        - Check if the same resource is doing activities in the wrong department? 

          We have the `resources` table that tells the department. 

          Example: In Case 1002, the Logistics department did Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods without waiting for Finance. 
          But that's not necessarily a resource issue. However, we can check if resources are performing activities outside their department? 

          Actually, the `order_event_log` has a `resource` column and the `resources` table has `department`. 

          We can check if the activity is typically done by a department and then see if the resource is from that department? 

          But note: the problem doesn't specify which activity belongs to which department. However, we can infer:

            Register Order: Sales
            Perform Credit Check: Finance
            Validate Stock: Logistics (Warehouse)
            Confirm Shipment: Logistics
            Ship Goods: Logistics
            Issue Invoice: Finance
            Receive Payment: Finance

          We can join with `resources` and then check if the resource's department matches the expected department for the activity.

          How? We need a mapping of activity to department. We can create a CTE:

          ```sql
          WITH activity_department AS (
            SELECT 
              unnest(ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment']) AS activity,
              unnest(ARRAY['Sales', 'Finance', 'Logistics', 'Logistics', 'Logistics', 'Finance', 'Finance']) AS expected_department
          )
          SELECT 
            log.case_id, 
            log.event_id, 
            log.activity, 
            log.resource,
            r.department as actual_department,
            ad.expected_department
          FROM order_event_log log
          JOIN resources r ON log.resource = r.resource_id
          JOIN activity_department ad ON log.activity = ad.activity
          WHERE r.department <> ad.expected_department;
          ```

          But note: the example data shows that SalesRep are in Sales, FinanceTeam in Finance, WarehouseClerk and LogisticsMgr in Logistics. 
          So this should be consistent. However, let's check:

          Case 1002: 
            'Confirm Shipment' by LogisticsMgr_2 -> expected Logistics -> matches.
            'Ship Goods' by WarehouseClerk_1 -> expected Logistics -> matches.

          So that's not the issue.

        - Another idea: Check the time between events? 

          For example, in Case 1002, the time between Register Order and Confirm Shipment is 5 minutes? And then Ship Goods 15 minutes after that? 
          Then Credit Check 45 minutes after Register Order? 

          We can compute the time between Register Order and Credit Check for priority orders vs standard? 

          But that might be for performance, not necessarily anomaly.

 7. Focus on the anomalies we found:

    a) Case 1004: 
        - Received payment without invoice? And without shipping? 
        - Also, the payment was received very quickly (5 minutes after order) and the order_value is 3000.00.

        Hypothesis: 
          - This might be a test order? Or a fraudulent order? 
          - Or perhaps a prepaid order? 

        Query: 
          ```sql
          SELECT 
            log.case_id,
            o.order_value,
            log.activity,
            log.timestamp,
            log.additional_info
          FROM order_event_log log
          JOIN orders o ON log.case_id = o.case_id
          WHERE log.case_id = 1004
          ORDER BY log.timestamp;
          ```

        But we want to find similar cases? 

        Query for cases that have 'Receive Payment' without having an 'Issue Invoice' event? 

        We can do:

        ```sql
        SELECT 
          log.case_id
        FROM order_event_log log
        WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
          AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 
            FROM order_event_log inv 
            WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id 
              AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
              AND inv.timestamp < log.timestamp
          );
        ```

        This would return case 1004.

        Similarly, we can check for 'Receive Payment' without 'Ship Goods'? 

        ```sql
        SELECT 
          log.case_id
        FROM order_event_log log
        WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
          AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 
            FROM order_event_log ship 
            WHERE ship.case_id = log.case_id 
              AND ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
              AND ship.timestamp < log.timestamp
          );
        ```

        This would also return case 1004.

    b) Case 1002: 
        - Out-of-order: Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods before Credit Check.

        Query: Find cases where 'Confirm Shipment' or 'Ship Goods' occur before 'Perform Credit Check':

        ```sql
        WITH credit_check AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as credit_check_ts
          FROM order_event_log
          WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
        ),
        early_shipment_events AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp, activity
          FROM order_event_log
          WHERE activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods')
        )
        SELECT e.case_id, e.activity, e.timestamp, c.credit_check_ts
        FROM early_shipment_events e
        LEFT JOIN credit_check c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
        WHERE e.timestamp < c.credit_check_ts OR c.credit_check_ts IS NULL;
        ```

        This would return:
          Case 1002: Confirm Shipment (2024-02-01 08:25:00) and Ship Goods (2024-02-01 08:40:00) before Credit Check (2024-02-01 09:10:00)

        Also, we can check if these cases are priority orders:

        ```sql
        SELECT 
          o.case_id,
          o.order_type,
          e.activity,
          e.timestamp,
          c.credit_check_ts
        FROM orders o
        JOIN early_shipment_events e ON o.case_id = e.case_id
        LEFT JOIN credit_check c ON o.case_id = c.case_id
        WHERE e.timestamp < c.credit_check_ts OR c.credit_check_ts IS NULL;
        ```

    c) Case 1003: 
        - Missing Validate Stock? 
        - Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment? 

        For missing Validate Stock:

        ```sql
        SELECT case_id
        FROM orders
        WHERE case_id NOT IN (
          SELECT case_id 
          FROM order_event_log 
          WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock'
        );
        ```

        This returns case 1003 and 1004.

        For Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment:

        ```sql
        WITH confirm_shipment AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as confirm_ts
          FROM order_event_log
          WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
        ),
        ship_goods AS (
          SELECT case_id, timestamp as ship_ts
          FROM order_event_log
          WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
        )
        SELECT s.case_id, s.ship_ts, c.confirm_ts
        FROM ship_goods s
        LEFT JOIN confirm_shipment c ON s.case_id = c.case_id
        WHERE s.ship_ts < c.confirm_ts OR c.confirm_ts IS NULL;
        ```

        This returns:
          Case 1002: Ship Goods at 08:40:00 and Confirm Shipment at 08:25:00? -> Wait, 08:40 is after 08:25? So not before? 
          Actually, in 1002: Confirm Shipment at 08:25:00 and Ship Goods at 08:40:00 -> correct order.

          Case 1003: Ship Goods at 2024-02-01 09:10:00 and Confirm Shipment at 2024-02-01 09:45:00 -> Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment? 
          So this case would be returned.

        Also, case 1004: 
          Confirm Shipment at 09:25:00 and Ship Goods at 09:50:00 -> correct.

        So only case 1003 has Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment.

 8. Summary of anomalies and proposed queries:

    Anomaly 1: Missing activities (especially 'Validate Stock', 'Perform Credit Check')
        Query: 
          ```sql
          WITH expected_activities AS (
            SELECT unnest(ARRAY['Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock']) AS activity
          ),
          case_activities AS (
            SELECT case_id, activity
            FROM order_event_log
          )
          SELECT ca.case_id, ea.activity AS missing_activity
          FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) ca
          CROSS JOIN expected_activities ea
          LEFT JOIN case_activities c 
            ON ca.case_id = c.case_id AND ea.activity = c.activity
          WHERE c.case_id IS NULL;
          ```

    Anomaly 2: Out-of-order activities:

        a) 'Confirm Shipment' or 'Ship Goods' before 'Perform Credit Check'
        b) 'Ship Goods' before 'Validate Stock'
        c) 'Ship Goods' before 'Confirm Shipment'
        d) 'Receive Payment' before 'Issue Invoice'

        We can write separate queries for each.

    Anomaly 3: Receiving payment without an invoice or without shipping? 

        Query for payment without invoice (before the payment):
          ```sql
          SELECT 
            log.case_id,
            log.timestamp as payment_time,
            (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log inv WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice') as invoice_time
          FROM order_event_log log
          WHERE log.activity = 'Receive Payment'
            AND (NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log inv WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice')
                 OR (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log inv WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice') > log.timestamp);
          ```

        Similarly, for payment without shipping (before the payment):
          ```sql
          SELECT 
            log.case_id,
            log.timestamp as payment_time,
            (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log ship WHERE ship.case_id = log.case_id AND ship.activity = 'Ship Goods') as ship_time
          FROM order_event_log log
          WHERE log.activity = 'Receive Payment'
            AND (NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log ship WHERE ship.case_id = log.case_id AND ship.activity = 'Ship Goods')
                 OR (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log ship WHERE ship.case_id = log.case_id AND ship.activity = 'Ship Goods') > log.timestamp);
          ```

    We can also combine these to see if there is a pattern (e.g., high value orders? priority orders?).

    Example: 
      ```sql
      SELECT 
        o.case_id,
        o.order_type,
        o.order_value,
        (CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = o.case_id AND activity = 'Perform Credit Check') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_credit_check,
        (CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = o.case_id AND activity = 'Validate Stock') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_validate_stock,
        ... 
      FROM orders o;
      ```

 9. Let's write the queries accordingly.

 Note: We are to propose SQL queries without hints. So we list the queries that can be run to detect the anomalies.

 However, note that the event log might be large, so we might want to focus on the anomalies we found in the sample.

 But the goal is to write queries that can be run on the entire log to find similar cases.

 We'll write:

 Query 1: Missing mandatory activities (for each case, check if all expected activities are present)

   We can focus on the core activities: 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment'

   But note: 'Register Order' is always there? And the others? 

   We'll check for the ones that are critical: Credit Check and Validate Stock? 

   However, the sample shows that even if an activity is missing, the case might have been completed? 

   We can do:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     case_id,
     bool_and(activity = 'Perform Credit Check') as has_credit_check,
     bool_and(activity = 'Validate Stock') as has_validate_stock,
     bool_and(activity = 'Issue Invoice') as has_issue_invoice,
     bool_and(activity = 'Receive Payment') as has_receive_payment
   FROM (
     SELECT case_id, 
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as "Perform Credit Check",
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as "Validate Stock",
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as "Issue Invoice",
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as "Receive Payment"
     FROM order_event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
   ) t
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING NOT (bool_and("Perform Credit Check" = 1) AND 
               bool_and("Validate Stock" = 1) AND 
               bool_and("Issue Invoice" = 1) AND 
               bool_and("Receive Payment" = 1));
   ```

   Actually, the above won't work because we are grouping by case_id and then having per case. We can do:

   ```sql
   SELECT case_id,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_credit_check,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_validate_stock,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_issue_invoice,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_receive_payment
   FROM order_event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
      OR MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
      OR MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
      OR MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
   ```

   But note: we don't require all? We require at least these? Actually, we want to know which ones are missing? 

   Alternatively, we can use the earlier method with cross join to list missing per case and activity.

   However, for simplicity, we can do:

   ```sql
   SELECT case_id,
          CASE WHEN has_credit_check = 0 THEN 'Missing Credit Check' END as missing_credit,
          CASE WHEN has_validate_stock = 0 THEN 'Missing Validate Stock' END as missing_validate,
          CASE WHEN has_issue_invoice = 0 THEN 'Missing Issue Invoice' END as missing_invoice,
          CASE WHEN has_receive_payment = 0 THEN 'Missing Receive Payment' END as missing_payment
   FROM (
     SELECT case_id,
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_credit_check,
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_validate_stock,
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_issue_invoice,
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_receive_payment
     FROM order_event_log
     GROUP BY case_id
   ) t
   WHERE has_credit_check = 0 OR has_validate_stock = 0 OR has_issue_invoice = 0 OR has_receive_payment = 0;
   ```

   But note: we don't require 'Receive Payment'? Actually, the process includes it, but if it's missing then the order is not completed? 
   We are interested in anomalies, so we can include.

 Query 2: Out-of-order activities

   We'll check for specific pairs:

   a) 'Ship Goods' after 'Perform Credit Check'? -> We want to find when it's not.

   We can do:

   ```sql
   WITH events AS (
     SELECT 
       case_id,
       activity,
       timestamp,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as event_order
     FROM order_event_log
   ),
   credit_check AS (
     SELECT case_id, timestamp as credit_check_time
     FROM events
     WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
   ),
   ship_goods AS (
     SELECT case_id, timestamp as ship_goods_time
     FROM events
     WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
   )
   SELECT s.case_id, 
          s.ship_goods_time, 
          c.credit_check_time,
          (s.ship_goods_time < c.credit_check_time) as ship_before_credit
   FROM ship_goods s
   LEFT JOIN credit_check c ON s.case_id = c.case_id
   WHERE s.ship_goods_time < c.credit_check_time OR c.credit_check_time IS NULL;
   ```

   Similarly for other pairs.

   We can create a function or a general query for any two activities? But for now, we write separate.

   Alternatively, we can use lag/lead to get the order of events? But the events are not contiguous.

   We can also compute the sequence of events and then check for the order of specific activities.

   However, given the complexity, we stick to the above method.

 Query 3: Payment without invoice or without shipping

   We already provided above.

 10. We'll now write the queries as per the prompt.

 Note: The prompt says "without any hints or guidance provided here", so we just write the SQL queries.

 But note: we are to propose queries to investigate the hypotheses. We can write:

   Hypothesis 1: Some orders are missing critical activities (like credit check) because they are priority orders? 
        Query: 
          ```sql
          SELECT 
            o.case_id,
            o.order_type,
            (CASE WHEN MAX(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN 'Missing' ELSE 'Present' END) as credit_check_status
          FROM orders o
          LEFT JOIN order_event_log log ON o.case_id = log.case_id
          GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type
          HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
          ```

   Hypothesis 2: Some orders have out-of-order activities because of priority handling? 
        Query for orders that are priority and have 'Ship Goods' before 'Perform Credit Check':

          ```sql
          WITH credit_check AS (
            SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as credit_check_ts
            FROM order_event_log
            WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
            GROUP BY case_id
          ),
          ship_goods AS (
            SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as ship_goods_ts
            FROM order_event_log
            WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
            GROUP BY case_id
          )
          SELECT o.case_id, o.order_type, s.ship_goods_ts, c.credit_check_ts
          FROM orders o
          JOIN ship_goods s ON o.case_id = s.case_id
          LEFT JOIN credit_check c ON o.case_id = c.case_id
          WHERE (s.ship_goods_ts < c.credit_check_ts OR c.credit_check_ts IS NULL)
            AND o.order_type = 'priority';
          ```

   Hypothesis 3: Payment received without an invoice might be due to prepaid orders? 
        But then why issue an invoice after? 

        We can check the additional_info for these cases? 

        Query:
          ```sql
          SELECT log.*, o.order_type, o.order_value
          FROM order_event_log log
          JOIN orders o ON log.case_id = o.case_id
          WHERE log.activity = 'Receive Payment'
            AND NOT EXISTS (
              SELECT 1 
              FROM order_event_log inv 
              WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id 
                AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
                AND inv.timestamp < log.timestamp
            );
          ```

        And then look at the additional_info for these cases? 

        Also, we can check if the payment amount equals the order_value? 

        In the additional_info of 'Receive Payment', we have 'amount=...'. We can extract that and compare with order_value.

        How to extract? We can use:

          substring(additional_info from 'amount=([0-9.]+)') 

        But note: the format might vary.

        Example for case 1004: additional_info is 'amount=3000.00'

        Query:

          ```sql
          SELECT 
            log.case_id,
            log.timestamp,
            log.additional_info,
            o.order_value,
            (substring(log.additional_info from 'amount=([0-9.]+)'))::DECIMAL as payment_amount
          FROM order_event_log log
          JOIN orders o ON log.case_id = o.case_id
          WHERE log.activity = 'Receive Payment'
            AND NOT EXISTS (
              SELECT 1 
              FROM order_event_log inv 
              WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id 
                AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
                AND inv.timestamp < log.timestamp
            );
          ```

        Then compare payment_amount and order_value? 

        We can add:

          AND (substring(log.additional_info from 'amount=([0-9.]+)'))::DECIMAL = o.order_value

        But if they are equal, it might be prepaid. If not, then it's an anomaly.

        However, in case 1004, they are equal (3000.00). So maybe it's prepaid? 

        But then why was an invoice issued after? That might be for record keeping.

        So this might be acceptable? 

        But the process flow says: Issue Invoice then Receive Payment. 

        So even if prepaid, the invoice should be issued first? 

        Or perhaps the payment is received and then the invoice is issued as a receipt? 

        This might be a process variation.

        However, the anomaly is that the payment was received without an invoice being issued first.

        We can also check the time between Register Order and Receive Payment: very short? 

        Query:

          ```sql
          SELECT 
            log.case_id,
            (log.timestamp - reg.timestamp) as time_to_payment
          FROM order_event_log log
          JOIN order_event_log reg ON log.case_id = reg.case_id AND reg.activity = 'Register Order'
          WHERE log.activity = 'Receive Payment'
            AND NOT EXISTS (
              SELECT 1 
              FROM order_event_log inv 
              WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id 
                AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
                AND inv.timestamp < log.timestamp
            );
          ```

        For case 1004: 5 minutes.

        This is very fast. So it might be an automated payment? 

        But without an invoice, it's still an anomaly in the process.

 11. We have provided several queries. We can choose the most relevant ones.

 Given the instructions, we'll list the queries that can be used to detect the anomalies we found.

 But note: the prompt says "propose relevant SQL queries ... to investigate these hypotheses". So we can list:

   Query for missing activities:

      ```sql
      SELECT 
        case_id,
        string_agg(missing_activity, ', ') as missing_activities
      FROM (
        WITH expected_activities(activity) AS (
          VALUES ('Perform Credit Check'), ('Validate Stock'), ('Issue Invoice'), ('Receive Payment')
        ),
        case_activities AS (
          SELECT case_id, activity
          FROM order_event_log
        )
        SELECT 
          ca.case_id,
          ea.activity AS missing_activity
        FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) ca
        CROSS JOIN expected_activities ea
        LEFT JOIN case_activities c 
          ON ca.case_id = c.case_id AND ea.activity = c.activity
        WHERE c.case_id IS NULL
      ) t
      GROUP BY case_id;
      ```

   Query for out-of-order: Ship Goods before Credit Check:

      ```sql
      WITH credit_check AS (
        SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as credit_check_ts
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
        GROUP BY case_id
      ),
      ship_goods AS (
        SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as ship_goods_ts
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
        GROUP BY case_id
      )
      SELECT s.case_id, s.ship_goods_ts, c.credit_check_ts
      FROM ship_goods s
      LEFT JOIN credit_check c ON s.case_id = c.case_id
      WHERE s.ship_goods_ts < c.credit_check_ts OR c.credit_check_ts IS NULL;
      ```

   Query for out-of-order: Ship Goods before Validate Stock:

      ```sql
      WITH validate_stock AS (
        SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as validate_stock_ts
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Validate Stock'
        GROUP BY case_id
      ),
      ship_goods AS (
        SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as ship_goods_ts
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
        GROUP BY case_id
      )
      SELECT s.case_id, s.ship_goods_ts, v.validate_stock_ts
      FROM ship_goods s
      LEFT JOIN validate_stock v ON s.case_id = v.case_id
      WHERE s.ship_goods_ts < v.validate_stock_ts OR v.validate_stock_ts IS NULL;
      ```

   Query for out-of-order: Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment:

      ```sql
      WITH confirm_shipment AS (
        SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as confirm_shipment_ts
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
        GROUP BY case_id
      ),
      ship_goods AS (
        SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as ship_goods_ts
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
        GROUP BY case_id
      )
      SELECT s.case_id, s.ship_goods_ts, c.confirm_shipment_ts
      FROM ship_goods s
      LEFT JOIN confirm_shipment c ON s.case_id = c.case_id
      WHERE s.ship_goods_ts < c.confirm_shipment_ts OR c.confirm_shipment_ts IS NULL;
      ```

   Query for out-of-order: Receive Payment before Issue Invoice:

      ```sql
      WITH issue_invoice AS (
        SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as issue_invoice_ts
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Issue Invoice'
        GROUP BY case_id
      ),
      receive_payment AS (
        SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as receive_payment_ts
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
        GROUP BY case_id
      )
      SELECT r.case_id, r.receive_payment_ts, i.issue_invoice_ts
      FROM receive_payment r
      LEFT JOIN issue_invoice i ON r.case_id = i.case_id
      WHERE r.receive_payment_ts < i.issue_invoice_ts OR i.issue_invoice_ts IS NULL;
      ```

   Query for payment without invoice (before payment):

      ```sql
      SELECT 
        log.case_id,
        log.timestamp as payment_time,
        (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log inv WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice') as invoice_time
      FROM order_event_log log
      WHERE log.activity = 'Receive Payment'
        AND (NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log inv WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice')
             OR (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log inv WHERE inv.case_id = log.case_id AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice') > log.timestamp);
      ```

   Query for payment without shipping (before payment):

      ```sql
      SELECT 
        log.case_id,
        log.timestamp as payment_time,
        (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log ship WHERE ship.case_id = log.case_id AND ship.activity = 'Ship Goods') as ship_time
      FROM order_event_log log
      WHERE log.activity = 'Receive Payment'
        AND (NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log ship WHERE ship.case_id = log.case_id AND ship.activity = 'Ship Goods')
             OR (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log ship WHERE ship.case_id = log.case_id AND ship.activity = 'Ship Goods') > log.timestamp);
      ```

 12. We can also combine with the orders table to see if order_type or order_value correlates.

   Example for missing activities:

      ```sql
      SELECT 
        o.case_id,
        o.order_type,
        o.order_value,
        missing.missing_activities
      FROM orders o
      JOIN (
        -- The missing activities query above
        SELECT 
          case_id,
          string_agg(missing_activity, ', ') as missing_activities
        FROM (
          WITH expected_activities(activity) AS (
            VALUES ('Perform Credit Check'), ('Validate Stock'), ('Issue Invoice'), ('Receive Payment')
          ),
          case_activities AS (
            SELECT case_id, activity
            FROM order_event_log
          )
          SELECT 
            ca.case_id,
            ea.activity AS missing_activity
          FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) ca
          CROSS JOIN expected_activities ea
          LEFT JOIN case_activities c 
            ON ca.case_id = c.case_id AND ea.activity = c.activity
          WHERE c.case_id IS NULL
        ) t
        GROUP BY case_id
      ) missing ON o.case_id = missing.case_id;
      ```

 13. We have provided a set of queries. The user can run these to detect anomalies and then investigate further.

 Note: The above queries are written for PostgreSQL.

 Let me know if you need any adjustments.

### Anomalies Identified and Hypotheses

Based on the event log data, several anomalies and undesirable behaviors were identified:

1. **Out-of-Sequence Activities**  
   - Case 1002: `Confirm Shipment` and `Ship Goods` occur *before* `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`  
   - Case 1003: `Ship Goods` occurs *before* `Confirm Shipment`  
   - Case 1004: `Receive Payment` occurs *before* `Issue Invoice` and `Ship Goods`  

   **Hypothesis**:  
   - Priority orders bypassing checks (1002)  
   - Manual process overrides or system logic errors (1003)  
   - Prepaid orders or system synchronization issues (1004)  

2. **Missing Critical Activities**  
   - Case 1003: Missing `Validate Stock` activity  
   - Case 1004: Missing `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`  

   **Hypothesis**:  
   - Policy exceptions for high-value orders (1004)  
   - Automation failures or manual process gaps  

3. **Resource Role Violations**  
   - `WarehouseClerk_3` performed `Ship Goods` without `Validate Stock` (1003)  
   - `FinanceTeam_02` received payment before invoice creation (1004)  

   **Hypothesis**:  
   - Insufficient training or policy enforcement  
   - Cross-departmental coordination failures

### SQL Queries to Investigate Anomalies

#### 1. Detect Orders with Out-of-Sequence Activities
```sql
WITH event_sequence AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT 
  o.case_id,
  o.order_type,
  es.activity,
  es.prev_activity,
  es.timestamp,
  r.role,
  r.department
FROM event_sequence es
JOIN orders o ON es.case_id = o.case_id
JOIN resources r ON es.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE 
  (es.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND es.prev_activity NOT IN ('Validate Stock', 'Perform Credit Check')) OR
  (es.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND es.prev_activity NOT IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Validate Stock')) OR
  (es.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND es.prev_activity <> 'Issue Invoice');
```

#### 2. Identify Missing Critical Activities
```sql
SELECT 
  o.case_id,
  o.order_type,
  o.order_value,
  BOOL_OR(activity = 'Perform Credit Check') AS has_credit_check,
  BOOL_OR(activity = 'Validate Stock') AS has_stock_validation,
  BOOL_OR(activity = 'Confirm Shipment') AS has_shipment_confirmation
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log log ON o.case_id = log.case_id
GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value
HAVING 
  NOT BOOL_OR(activity = 'Perform Credit Check') OR 
  NOT BOOL_OR(activity = 'Validate Stock') OR 
  NOT BOOL_OR(activity = 'Confirm Shipment');
```

#### 3. Find Resource-Department Policy Violations
```sql
SELECT 
  log.case_id,
  log.activity,
  log.timestamp,
  log.resource,
  r.role,
  r.department,
  CASE 
    WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' AND r.department <> 'Logistics' THEN 'Non-Logistics Shipping'
    WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department <> 'Finance' THEN 'Non-Finance Credit Check'
    WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' AND r.role NOT LIKE 'Cashier%' THEN 'Non-Cashier Payment'
  END AS violation_type
FROM order_event_log log
JOIN resources r ON log.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE 
  (activity = 'Ship Goods' AND r.department <> 'Logistics') OR
  (activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department <> 'Finance') OR
  (activity = 'Receive Payment' AND r.role NOT LIKE 'Cashier%');
```

#### 4. High-Value Orders with Shortcutted Processes
```sql
SELECT 
  o.case_id,
  o.order_value,
  o.order_type,
  MIN(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Register Order' THEN log.timestamp END) AS register_time,
  MIN(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN log.timestamp END) AS payment_time,
  BOOL_OR(log.activity = 'Perform Credit Check') AS credit_check_done,
  (MIN(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN log.timestamp END) - 
   MIN(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Register Order' THEN log.timestamp END)) AS process_duration
FROM orders o
JOIN order_event_log log ON o.case_id = log.case_id
WHERE o.order_value > 2000
GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_value, o.order_type
HAVING 
  NOT BOOL_OR(log.activity = 'Perform Credit Check') OR 
  (MIN(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN log.timestamp END) < 
   MIN(CASE WHEN log.activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN log.timestamp END));
```

#### 5. Cross-Department Activity Timing Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
  case_id,
  activity,
  resource,
  timestamp,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER w)) / 60 AS mins_since_prev,
  LEAD(activity) OVER w AS next_activity
FROM order_event_log
WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Key Investigation Focus Areas

1. **Priority Order Handling**:  
   - Use Query 1 to identify if `order_type = 'priority'` correlates with sequence violations  
   - Check if high-value orders (Query 4) systematically bypass checks  

2. **Resource Training Gaps**:  
   - Query 3 results will show departments/roles performing incorrect activities  
   - Correlate with `additional_info` for manual override indicators  

3. **System Logic Validation**:  
   - Query 2 will reveal missing critical steps requiring automation audits  
   - Query 5 exposes timing anomalies between process steps  

4. **Payment Process Risks**:  
   - Query 4 identifies prepaid orders violating invoice-payment sequence  
   - Validate against `additional_info->'amount'` vs `orders.order_value` for mismatches
