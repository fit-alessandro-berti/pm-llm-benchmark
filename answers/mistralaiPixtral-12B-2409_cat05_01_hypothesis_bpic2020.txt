   - **Confidence Score: 9/10**

2. **Which process variant has the highest performance value?**
   - **Confidence Score: 9/10**

3. **What is the average time taken for each process variant to be completed?**
   - **Confidence Score: 8/10**

4. **How often do declarations get rejected by the administration?**
   - **Confidence Score: 8/10**

5. **What percentage of declarations are ultimately approved and handled for payment?**

7. **What is the average number of rejections before a declaration is finally approved?**
   - **Confidence Score: 7/10**

8. **How does the performance value change when a declaration involves a budget owner?**
   - **Confidence Score: 7/10**

9. **What is the frequency of declarations saved by the employee without further action?**

13. **What is the most common reason for rejection by the supervisor?**
    - **Confidence Score: 6/10**

14. **How does the involvement of a missing document affect the performance value?**
    - **Confidence Score: 6/10**

15. **What is the average time taken for declarations that involve multiple rejections?**
    - **Confidence Score: 6/10**

16. **How does the frequency of different process variants compare to each other?**
    - **Confidence Score: 6/10**

17. **What is the impact of budget owner rejection on the overall process?**
    - **Confidence Score: 6/10**

18. **How often do declarations get rejected by the pre-approver?**
    - **Confidence Score: 6/10**

19. **What is the average performance value for declarations involving the pre-approver?**
