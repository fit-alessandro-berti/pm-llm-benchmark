Okay, I'm trying to figure out which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process described. Let me go through each case one by one to see if they follow the correct sequence.

Starting with Case 1. The activities are Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order. That looks exactly like the ideal flow when inventory is sufficient. So Case 1 seems fine.

Now, Case 2. The activities are Receive, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship, Close. Wait, after Check inventory, it goes to Package items, then Authorize payment. But according to the normative process, after checking inventory, if it's sufficient, the next step should be Authorize payment, then Package, then Ship. So in Case 2, Packaging happens before Authorization, which is out of order. That's a violation because payment should be authorized before packaging.

Moving on to Case 3. The sequence is Receive, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship, Close. After Authorize payment, it goes to Cancel order. But the normative process says that if inventory is insufficient, after Check inventory, it should go directly to Cancel, then Close. Also, after Cancel, you shouldn't proceed to Ship. So here, after Cancel, it's trying to Ship, which doesn't make sense. So two violations here: shipping after cancellation and not closing immediately after cancellation.

Case 4 is Receive, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order. That's the correct sequence when inventory is insufficient. It goes from Check to Cancel to Close, which is exactly what the normative process outlines. So Case 4 is fine.

Case 5 has Receive, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close. Wait, after Authorize payment, it goes directly to Ship without Packaging items. The normative process says that after Authorization, you should Package, then Ship. So missing the Package step is a violation.

So summarizing the issues:
- Case 2: Packaging before Authorization.
- Case 3: Shipping after Cancellation and not closing after Cancellation.
- Case 5: Shipping without Packaging.

I think that's all the deviations. Each of these cases breaks the sequence set by the normative process as described.

**Identification of Deviant Cases and Explanation of Violations**

After analyzing the event log against the normative process, the following cases deviate from the expected process flow:

1. **Case 2**  
   - **Violation:** The activities occur in the sequence: Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment.  
   - **Explanation:** According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items." Packaging items before payment authorization violates this rule.  

2. **Case 3**  
   - **Violation:** The activities occur in the sequence: Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order.  
   - **Explanation:** After canceling an order, the process should proceed directly to "Close order." Shipping an order after cancellation is illogical and violates the normative process. Additionally, the order should not be shipped if it has been canceled.  

3. **Case 5**  
   - **Violation:** The activities occur in the sequence: Authorize payment  Ship order.  
   - **Explanation:** According to the normative process, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items." Skipping the packaging step before shipping violates the expected process flow.  

**Summary of Violations:**

- **Case 2:** Packaging occurs before payment authorization.  
- **Case 3:** Shipping occurs after order cancellation, and the order is not closed immediately after cancellation.  
- **Case 5:** Shipping occurs without the prior packaging of items.  

These deviations indicate that Cases 2, 3, and 5 do not adhere to the normative process as described.
