To infer the case IDs from the given sequence of events, we need to consider several factors such as timestamps, activities, departments, patient ages, and genders. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how these events can be grouped into separate cases:

1. **Identify Unique Patients:** Each unique combination of `patient_age` and `patient_gender` likely represents a different patient.
2. **Follow Logical Sequences:** The order of activities should follow a logical sequence for each patient journey (e.g., registration, triage, consultation, treatment, discharge).
3. **Consider Timestamps:** Events happening closely in time and involving the same patient attributes are likely part of the same case.

Let's analyze the events based on these criteria:

### Case 1:
- **Patient Attributes:** Age: 45, Gender: M
- **Events:**
  1. Register patient (ER)
  4. Initial triage (ER)
  7. X-ray imaging (Radiology)
  12. Doctor consultation (ER) - diagnosis=hairline_fracture
  15. Patient discharged (ER)

### Case 2:
- **Patient Attributes:** Age: 62, Gender: F
- **Events:**
  2. Register patient (ER)
  5. Initial triage (ER)
  8. Lab test requested (ER)
  10. Lab test completed (Laboratory)
  11. Doctor consultation (ER) - diagnosis=minor_infection
  14. Prescription created (ER)
  17. Patient discharged (ER)

### Case 3:
- **Patient Attributes:** Age: 28, Gender: M
- **Events:**
  3. Register patient (Surgery)
  6. Doctor consultation (Surgery)
  9. Surgery preparation (Surgery)
  13. Surgery performed (Surgery)
  16. Recovery room (Surgery)
  18. Patient discharged (Surgery)

By grouping the events based on the patient attributes and their logical sequences, we get the following inferred case groupings:
