Okay, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to figure out which cases took longer than usual. The event log shows each case with timestamps from start to close. So for each case, I need to calculate the total time from Receive Ticket to Close Ticket.

Looking at the table, let's start with Case 101. The first event is 2024-03-01 08:00 and the last is 10:15 the same day. So from 08:00 to 10:15 is 2 hours and 15 minutes. Then Case 102 starts at 08:05 and closes on March 2nd at 09:15. That's over a day later, so definitely longer. Case 103 is from 08:10 to 09:30 same day, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Case 104 starts at 08:20 and closes next day at 08:30, so around 24 hours. Case 105 starts at 08:25 and closes on March 3rd at 09:30, which is two days later. 

So the average might be around a few hours, but Cases 102, 104, and 105 are taking much longer. Let's quantify the times:

- Case 101: 2h15m
- Case 102: ~25h10m (from 08:05 to next day 09:15)
- Case 103: 1h20m
- Case 104: ~24h10m
- Case 105: ~48h5m

So 102, 104, 105 are significantly longer. Now, looking at their activities. 

Case 102 has an escalation to Level-2. The time between Assign to Level-1 (09:00) and Escalate (11:30) is 2.5 hours. Then from Escalate to Investigate (14:00) same day, 2.5 hours. Then Resolve next day at 09:00, which is 19 hours later. That's a big wait. Maybe the Level-2 agent took time to pick it up or investigate.

Case 104: After Assign to Level-1 at 09:30, Investigate at 13:00 (3.5 hours wait), then Resolve next day at 08:00 (19 hours wait). No escalation, but long waits before investigate and resolve.

Case 105: Assigned at 09:00, then Investigate at 09:10 (quick), then Escalate at 10:00. Then a long wait until March 2nd 14:00 to investigate again (over 24 hours), then Resolve on March 3rd. So the escalation led to a very long delay in Level-2 investigation.

Potential root causes: Escalations (cases 102, 105) leading to longer processing times, possibly because Level-2 agents are busy or take longer. Also, in cases without escalation (like 104), there are long waits between steps, maybe due to agent availability or workload.

Wait times between activities: For example, in Case 102, after escalation, the investigation happens same day but then resolve is next day. In Case 104, after investigation, resolve is next day. Maybe agents are not working on weekends or evenings? Or maybe there's a handoff delay.

Proposals: Improve escalation process efficiency, ensure Level-2 agents have capacity, reduce waiting times by better scheduling or prioritization. Maybe automate triage to quicker assign complex cases to Level-2 sooner. Analyze agent workload and add more resources if necessary.

| 102         | ~25h 10m                               | **Delayed** (escalation, overnight wait)          |
| 103         | 1h 20m                                 | Normal timeframe                                     |
| 104         | ~24h 10m                               | **Delayed** (no escalation, prolonged investigation/resolution gaps) |
| 105         | ~48h 5m                               | **Severely Delayed** (escalation, multi-day gaps)  |

**Significant Delays**: Cases 102, 104, and 105 (resolution times 24 hours).

| **Long Waiting Times Between Activities**          | - Case 104: 3.5-hour wait for investigation, 19-hour wait for resolution. |  
|                                                   | - Case 102: 2.5-hour wait post-assignment, 19-hour wait post-escalation. |
| **Agent Capacity/Availability**                   | - Cases 102/105: Delays align with potential overnight/next-day handoffs. |
| **Inefficient Escalation Process**                 | - Case 105 required escalation despite quick initial investigation. |

### **3. Analysis and Recommendations**

#### **Root Causes Explained**
1. **Escalations**:  
   - Escalated cases (102, 105) faced significant delays due to **Level-2 agent unavailability** or heavy workload.  
   - **Example**: Case 105 waited 24+ hours after escalation for Level-2 investigation, suggesting bottlenecks in specialized teams.

2. **Waiting Times**:  
   - Non-escalated Case 104 experienced delays due to **gaps in agent activity** (e.g., 19-hour wait for resolution after investigation).  
   - **Nighttime/Next-Day Gaps**: Activities often stalled overnight (e.g., Case 102 resolved at 09:00 the next day), implying **inadequate 24/7 support**.

3. **Process Inefficiencies**:  
   - Case 105 was escalated despite a quick initial investigation, suggesting **poor triage** in identifying complex issues early.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Optimize Escalation**:
   - **Prioritize Escalated Tickets**: Ensure Level-2 agents dedicate fixed slots for escalated cases.
   - **Automate Triage**: Use AI-driven triage to flag high-risk tickets for immediate escalation.

2. **Reduce Waiting Times**:
   - **Agent Scheduling**: Stagger shifts to minimize overnight gaps (e.g., dedicated night-shift agents).
   - **SLA Enforcement**: Mandate <4-hour response times for investigation/resolution steps.

3. **Analyze Agent Workload**:
   - **Capacity Planning**: Allocate more resources to Level-2 teams if backlog persists.
   - **Feedback Loops**: Train Level-1 agents to preemptively identify cases requiring escalation.

#### **Key Insight**
Delays are primarily driven by **escalation bottlenecks** and **inefficient handoffs**. Addressing these through process streamlining and resource optimization can significantly reduce cycle times.
