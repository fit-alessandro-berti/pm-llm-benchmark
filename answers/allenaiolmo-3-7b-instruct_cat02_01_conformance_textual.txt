Let's analyze the event logs against the normative process description to identify deviations and explain the rule violations.

### **Normative Process Key Rules (Summary)**

1. **Always start with "Receive order".**
2. **Next: "Check inventory".**
   - After receiving, check inventory before moving to payment or fulfillment.
3. **If inventory sufficient:**
   - Then "Authorize payment".
   - Then "Package items".
   - Then "Ship order".
   - Finally, "Close order".
4. **If inventory insufficient:**
   - After checking inventory, immediately "Cancel order".
   - Do **not** proceed to fulfillment activities (package, ship).
   - Then "Close order".
5. **Forbidden sequences:**
   - Authorize payment before checking inventory.
   - Package or ship before inventory check or payment authorization.
   - Ship order after a cancellation (i.e., after an order is canceled).
   - Close order before all required steps are completed (should always be last).

### **Case Analysis**

#### **Case 1**
**Sequence:**  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

**Assessment:**  
This follows the *sufficient inventory* path exactly as described.  
- Check inventory before payment (OK).
- Payment authorized after inventory check (OK).
- Packaging after payment (OK).
- Shipping after packaging (OK).
- Closing last (OK).

**Conclusion:**  
No violation. This case is compliant.

---

#### **Case 2**
**Sequence:**  
Receive  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Issues:**
- After "Check inventory", the next step is "Package items" **before** authorizing payment.
- According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" must occur **before** packaging (since payment authorization is a prerequisite for preparing and shipping).
- Also, "Ship order" occurs before authorization—another violation.

**Explanation:**  
The process requires that payment authorization must happen **before** packaging and shipping, since payment needs to be confirmed before goods are processed for shipment. In this case, the order is being packaged and shipped before the customer's payment is verified, which is a logical and process-control violation.

**Rule Violated:**  
- "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items" and "Ship order" (per the normative description).
- Sequencing "Package" before "Authorize payment" is not allowed.

**Conclusion:**  
**Case 2 is non-compliant.** It skips the required payment authorization step before packaging/shipping, violating the dependency flow described in the normative process.

---

#### **Case 3**
**Sequence:**  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

**Issues:**
- After authorization and before closing, the process "Cancel order" is performed.
- Once an order is canceled, all fulfillment steps (package, ship) should not occur.
- More critically, "Ship order" occurs **after** cancellation, which is clearly a violation. Once an order is canceled, it should not be shipped, and shipping is only appropriate for fulfilled orders.

**Explanation:**  
Cancelling an order should end the process with "Close order", and no further fulfillment or shipping activities should take place. Shipping after cancellation is illogical and not covered by the normative description.

**Rule Violated:**  
- "Ship order" must only occur after fulfillment (i.e., after packaging), and only if the order is not canceled.
- Shipping after a cancellation is not allowed.

**Conclusion:**  
**Case 3 is non-compliant.** The "Ship order" activity occurs after the order has been canceled, which is invalid.

---

#### **Case 4**
**Sequence:**  
Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

**Assessment:**  
This follows the "insufficient inventory" branch correctly:
- Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
- No unauthorized movement to fulfillment steps.
- Closing is last.

**Conclusion:**  
**Compliant.** This matches the expected insufficient inventory path.

---

#### **Case 5**
**Sequence:**  
Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Issues:**
- Similar to Case 2, but skips packaging.
- According to the normative process, after authorization, the next step should be packaging before shipping.
- "Ship order" appears before packaging, which is a violation.
- Also, packaging is missing before shipping, which is required per the process (since you can't ship without preparing the items).

**Explanation:**  
The process mandates "Package items" immediately before shipping. Skipping packaging and shipping directly after payment authorization is a violation of the required sequence.

**Rule Violated:**  
- "Package items" must occur before "Ship order".
- Packaging is omitted before shipping.

**Conclusion:**  
**Case 5 is non-compliant.** Packaging must precede shipping, but it is missing in this sequence.

---

### **Summary of Violations**

| Case | Violation(s) | Explanation |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 2 | - Packaging and shipping before payment authorization.<br>- Incorrect sequencing of payment, packaging, and shipping. | Payment must be authorized before packaging and shipping, per the normative process. |
| 3 | - Shipping an order after it has been canceled.<br>- Continuing fulfillment activities after cancellation. | Once an order is canceled, fulfillment and shipping are not permitted. |
| 5 | - Shipping without prior packaging.<br>- Omission of required packaging step before shipping. | Packaging must occur before shipping as part of the fulfillment workflow. |

### **Final Answer**

**Non-compliant cases and explanations:**

1. **Case 2**:  
   *Violation*: The process skips authorizing payment before packaging and shipping. According to the normative description, payment authorization must occur **before** packaging and shipping, as these activities depend on payment confirmation.  
   *Rule broken*: "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items" and "Ship order".

2. **Case 3**:  
   *Violation*: The order is canceled, but the process then ships the order. The normative process only allows shipping after fulfillment and before cancellation.  
   *Rule broken*: "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order".

3. **Case 5**:  
   *Violation*: The order is shipped without first being packaged. The process mandates that items be packaged before shipping.  
   *Rule broken*: "Package items" must occur before "Ship order".

**Compliant cases:**  
- Case 1 (full fulfillment path)
- Case 4 (cancellation path)
