# Process Mining Event Log

Below is the comprehensive event log derived from the provided ERP tables. Each row represents a single event in the order-to-cash process.

**Key Assumptions & Design Decisions:**
- **Case ID**: `order_id` as the process instance identifier.
- **Picking Events**: One event per order line (granular, reflects individual picker actions).
- **Delivery Events**: Separate "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events per delivery record (handles split shipments).
- **Invoice & Payment Events**: One event per invoice and per payment (reflects billing/payment installments).
- **Resources**: Mapped using the Resources table where available (sales_person_id, picker_id, carrier_id, billing_person_id).
- **Chronological Order**: Events sorted by `order_id` then `Timestamp` within each case.
- **Missing Data**: Order 1004 has no delivery/invoice/payment records (process incomplete).
