This visualization appears to be a complex diagram showing the workflow and interaction between lab visits and lab tests. It consists of three main parts:

1. A detailed process flow diagram (part a) showing two interconnected "proclet classes" with various activities and transitions. The workflow includes steps like order entry, taking blood samples, receiving results, judging results, and potentially redoing tests. The diagram uses symbols like circles, rectangles, and arrows to show the flow and connections.

2. A simplified class diagram (part b) showing the relationship between "Lab visit" and "Lab test" components, connected by a "requires" relationship.

3. A table (part c) labeled as "Example of a performative" that shows communication details including Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, and Direction. The example shows a lab test order request.

The diagram uses dotted lines to show communication channels between different parts of the process, and solid lines to show the main process flow. Various roles are indicated, including lab assistant, doctor, and chemical analyst. The overall visualization appears to be documenting a healthcare laboratory testing process and its associated communication patterns.
