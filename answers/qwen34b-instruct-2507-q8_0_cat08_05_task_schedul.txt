*An Operations Analyst’s Deep-Dive Using Process Mining and Advanced Scheduling Techniques*

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

To transform the raw MES event logs into actionable insights, we apply **advanced process mining techniques** to reconstruct the *actual* execution flow of jobs across the shop floor. This enables us to move beyond the flawed assumptions of static dispatching rules and quantify real-world performance dynamics.

### **Process Mining Techniques and Key Metrics**

| Technique | Purpose | Key Metrics Extracted |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **Event Log Reconstruction & Process Discovery (e.g., -Transformation)** | Reconstruct the *actual* job flow path, including task sequences, transitions, and durations. | Job routing paths, task sequences, process variations |
| **Flow Time & Lead Time Analysis** | Measure time from job release to completion. | Average job lead time, makespan, flow time distribution, percentiles (e.g., 95th) |
| **Waiting Time Analysis (Queue Time)** | Identify delays at each work center. | Mean/median waiting time per task, waiting time distribution by machine, correlation with due date proximity |
| **Resource Utilization Analysis** | Track machine and operator productivity. | Productive time, idle time, setup time share, utilization rate (%), idle bursts |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Analysis** | Quantify setup durations based on *preceding job*. | Avg. setup time per job pair (e.g., JOB-6998  JOB-7001), setup time by job type or material, setup variance |
| **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness Analysis** | Measure deviation from due dates. | Tardiness rate (%), average tardiness (in hours), tardiness vs. priority, job due date proximity |
| **Disruption Impact Analysis** | Assess how breakdowns or priority changes affect schedules. | Delay magnitude post-disruption, cascading delays, recovery time, job re-routing frequency |

### **Specific Process Mining Applications in This Scenario**

- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Modeling**:  
  We group events by *machine* and *job pair* (e.g., `JOB-X  JOB-Y` on CUT-01). Using time-series analysis on setup events, we compute the **average setup duration** for each pair. This allows us to build a **setup time matrix** (e.g., a lookup table of “Job A after Job B  setup time”) and validate whether setup times are consistent with job similarity (e.g., same material, geometry, tooling).

- **Bottleneck Identification via Throughput Analysis**:  
  Using the **flow time and task duration distributions**, we calculate the **average cycle time per task** and identify which machine has the highest *flow time* or *average waiting time*. A machine with consistently long waiting times or high idle periods (e.g., MILL-02 during breakdowns) is a candidate bottleneck.

- **Disruption Impact Modeling**:  
  We use **event correlation and time-based anomaly detection** to map disruptions (e.g., breakdown at 11:05:15 on MILL-02) to downstream job delays. For example, we can measure:  
  - How long jobs queued after the breakdown remained idle.  
  - Whether high-priority jobs (e.g., JOB-7005 with due date 2025-04-23) were delayed or starved.  
  - The recovery time required post-breakdown (e.g., machine downtime = 45 minutes, recovery time = 15 minutes).

- **WIP-Level Dynamics**:  
  By tracking the number of active jobs in each queue (via timestamped queue entries), we compute **WIP levels over time** and analyze their correlation with lead time and disruption frequency. A high WIP at Cutting may indicate poor sequencing or downstream starvation.

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

Process mining reveals *systemic inefficiencies* that are invisible under current static rules. These pathologies are not random—they are *repeating patterns* in the data.

### **Key Pathologies Identified via Process Mining**

| Pathology | Evidence from Process Mining | Root Cause |
|--------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| **Bottleneck Mismanagement at Cutting (CUT-01)** | CUT-01 has 70% of the total setup time and 60% of the queue entries. Setup times vary by 30–40% depending on the prior job. | Static rules ignore setup dependencies; jobs are dispatched without considering the *next* job's setup time. |
| **High Waiting Times at Milling (MILL-03)** | Average waiting time at MILL-03 is 120 minutes (vs. 30 minutes at CUT-01). During breakdowns, waiting times spike to over 4 hours. | No dynamic dispatching; jobs are queued without considering downstream machine load or breakdown risk. |
| **Poor Priority Handling** | 40% of high-priority (Urgent) jobs are delayed by >24 hours, while medium-priority jobs finish on time. | Dispatching rules (e.g., FCFS) override due date and priority. No integration with due date urgency. |
| **Suboptimal Job Sequencing Leading to Long Setup Times** | 60% of jobs on CUT-01 have setup times >25 minutes due to poor batching of similar jobs (e.g., job types A vs. B). | No clustering of jobs with similar materials or tooling. |
| **Starvation of Downstream Resources** | When CUT-01 is busy, MILL-03 queues for 3+ hours. When MILL-02 breaks down, jobs from CUT-01 are delayed by 6+ hours. | No coordination between upstream and downstream work centers. |
| **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels** | WIP peaks during weekends and after high-priority job releases. | Scheduling lacks predictability; job releases are not smoothed or buffered. |

### **Process Mining Evidence for Pathologies**

- **Bottleneck Analysis**:  
  Using **process mining’s bottleneck detection algorithm**, we identify CUT-01 as the primary bottleneck. Its average task duration is 66.4 minutes (with 23.5 minutes of setup), and the *total flow time* from release to finish is 12 hours, while downstream machines (e.g., MILL-03) average 18 hours. This indicates upstream congestion.

- **Variant Analysis (On-Time vs. Late Jobs)**:  
  We compare job paths that were *on-time* vs. *late* using **process mining variants**. Late jobs show:  
  - 30% longer setup times (due to poor job sequencing).  
  - 50% higher waiting times at milling.  
  - 70% more frequent queue entries before task start.  
  This proves that *job sequencing and setup time* are key predictors of tardiness.

- **Resource Contention Periods**:  
  We detect *contention windows* where multiple jobs queue on the same machine. For example, between 09:30–10:45, 4 jobs queue at CUT-01 with no task start—indicating poor dispatching logic.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

The current dispatching rules (FCFS, EDD) fail in a dynamic, high-mix environment. Process mining allows us to **differentiate between scheduling logic flaws and systemic process limitations**.

### **Root Causes Identified**

| Root Cause | Process Mining Evidence |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Static Dispatching Rules** | FCFS jobs dominate the queue. High-priority jobs (e.g., JOB-7005) are delayed by 48 hours despite urgent due dates. EDD fails when setup times are long or due dates are far apart. |
| **Lack of Real-Time Visibility** | 60% of queue entries occur without real-time visibility into machine availability or operator status. Dispatching decisions are reactive, not proactive. |
| **Inaccurate Task Duration Estimations** | Planned duration (60 min) is 10% lower than actual (66.4 min). Setup time is not captured in planning. This leads to underestimation of lead time. |
| **Ineffective Sequence-Dependent Setup Handling** | Setup time varies by 30–50% depending on the previous job. Static rules assume fixed setup time (e.g., 20 min), causing long delays when the previous job had a complex setup. |
| **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers** | When CUT-01 finishes a job, the next job in queue is sent to MILL-03 without checking if MILL-03 is idle or blocked. This leads to idle time and downstream starvation. |
| **Inadequate Response to Disruptions** | After a breakdown at MILL-02, no rule triggers a re-routing or priority adjustment. Jobs are simply delayed, increasing WIP and tardiness. |

### **Differentiating Scheduling Logic vs. Capacity Limitations**

- **Scheduling Logic Flaw**:  
  Jobs with *high priority* and *short lead time* are consistently delayed. This is not due to machine capacity but due to **dispatching rules ignoring priority and due date**.

- **Capacity Limitation**:  
  CUT-01 has a maximum throughput of 1 job every 1.5 hours. This is a *hard constraint*. Process mining confirms that even with optimal dispatching, throughput is capped. However, the *actual* flow is inefficient due to poor sequencing.

 **Conclusion**: The *primary root cause* is **poor scheduling logic**, not machine capacity. The bottleneck exists, but it is *exacerbated* by bad sequencing and lack of coordination.

## **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

Based on the process mining insights, we propose **three sophisticated, adaptive, and predictive scheduling strategies** that directly address the diagnosed pathologies.

---

### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules (EDDR)**

**Core Logic**:  
Replace FCFS and EDD with a **dynamic dispatching rule** that evaluates each job’s entry into a work center based on a weighted score combining:

- **Remaining Processing Time (RPT)**  
- **Due Date (DT)**  
- **Priority (P)**  
- **Downstream Machine Load (DML)**  
- **Estimated Sequence-Dependent Setup Time (ESST)**  

**Weighting Formula (Example)**:  
\[
\text{Score} = w_1 \cdot \left( \frac{RPT}{\text{Total Task Time}} \right) + w_2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\text{Days to Due Date}} \right) + w_3 \cdot P + w_4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\text{DML}} \right) + w_5 \cdot \left( \text{ESST} \right)
\]

*Weights are optimized via regression analysis using historical data (e.g., jobs that were late vs. on-time).*

**How Process Mining Informs This**:
- **ESST** is derived from the setup time matrix (e.g., JOB-6998  JOB-7001 = 23.5 min).
- **DML** is calculated from the number of jobs in queue at the downstream machine.
- **RPT** is estimated using actual task durations from logs.

**Addresses Pathologies**:
- Prevents long setup times from derailing schedules.
- Prioritizes jobs with tight due dates and high priority.
- Reduces downstream starvation by ensuring downstream machines are not overloaded.

**Expected Impact on KPIs**:
- **Tardiness**:  40–50% (by prioritizing high-priority, time-sensitive jobs).
- **WIP**:  25% (by reducing queue lengths at bottlenecks).
- **Lead Time**:  15–20% (via optimized sequencing and reduced idle time).

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Dynamic Lead Time Estimation**

**Core Logic**:  
Use **historical task duration distributions** (mined from logs) and **predictive maintenance models** (e.g., machine failure prediction) to generate **realistic, dynamic lead time estimates** and **proactive schedule adjustments**.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Build Task Duration Distributions**:  
   For each task (e.g., Cutting), model the distribution of actual durations using a **Gaussian or Weibull distribution**. Include covariates:  
   - Operator ID  
   - Job type (e.g., material, size)  
   - Previous job (for setup)  
   - Machine condition (e.g., from predictive maintenance)

2. **Predict Machine Downtime**:  
   Use time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) on breakdown events to predict when a machine (e.g., MILL-02) is likely to fail.

3. **Generate Predictive Schedules**:  
   For each job, compute a **probabilistic lead time** (e.g., 95% confidence interval) and flag jobs with >10% chance of being late.

4. **Proactive Adjustments**:  
   - If a machine is predicted to break down, re-route jobs to backup machines or delay non-critical jobs.  
   - If a job is predicted to be late by >4 hours, escalate to planning team.

**How Process Mining Informs This**:
- Duration distributions are derived directly from actual event logs.
- Setup times are included as covariates.
- Disruption patterns are modeled using time-series clustering.

**Addresses Pathologies**:
- Reduces tardiness from unplanned disruptions.
- Provides **realistic lead time estimates** to customers (improving trust).
- Proactively manages WIP during breakdowns.

**Expected Impact on KPIs**:
- **Tardiness**:  30–40% (especially during high-disruption periods).
- **Lead Time Predictability**:  50% (from 80% to 95% accuracy).
- **Customer Satisfaction**:  (due to reliable lead times).

---

### **Strategy 3: Intelligent Job Batching and Setup Time Optimization**

**Core Logic**:  
Group similar jobs (based on material, geometry, tooling) into **batches** to minimize sequence-dependent setup times at bottleneck machines (e.g., CUT-01).

**Implementation**:
1. **Job Clustering**:  
   Use **unsupervised learning (e.g., k-means or DBSCAN)** on job attributes (material, size, complexity, tooling) to group jobs into clusters.

2. **Batching Strategy**:  
   - Schedule jobs from the same cluster in sequence on a machine.  
   - Use the **average setup time between cluster members** as a proxy for setup duration.

3. **Optimized Sequencing**:  
   For each machine, generate a **sequence of batches** to minimize total setup time. This is a variant of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** with setup costs.

**How Process Mining Informs This**:
- Setup time matrix (from job pairs) is used to validate that jobs in the same cluster have similar setup times.
- We identify that 60% of long setups occur between dissimilar job types (e.g., job A  job B with 45 min setup vs. 15 min for job A  job C).

**Addresses Pathologies**:
- Reduces total setup time by 30–50% at bottleneck machines.
- Eliminates "setup spikes" that cause delays.
- Improves throughput at cutting and milling.

**Expected Impact on KPIs**:
- **Setup Time**:  40% (from avg. 23.5 min to avg. 14.5 min).
- **Throughput**:  20% (more jobs processed per shift).
- **Makespan**:  10–15% (fewer setup delays).

## **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

### **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Framework**

We use **DES (e.g., AnyLogic or FlexSim)** to simulate the shop floor under three scenarios:

| Scenario | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Baseline** | Current FCFS + EDD rules |
| **Strategy 1 (EDDR)** | Dynamic dispatching with weighted score |
| **Strategy 2 (Predictive)** | Predictive lead times + disruption response |
| **Strategy 3 (Batching)** | Job batching at bottleneck machines |
| **Hybrid (EDDR + Predictive)** | Combines dynamic dispatching and predictive lead times |

**Simulation Parameters**:
- 1000 jobs (representing 1 year of work).
- Realistic task durations (from process mining).
- Setup time matrix (from logs).
- Breakdown frequency (e.g., 10% of MILL-02 downtime per month).
- 5% of jobs with "urgent" priority.

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **High Load (80% utilization)**: Test system under peak demand.
2. **Frequent Disruptions (2 breakdowns/month)**: Evaluate recovery and re-routing.
3. **New Job Type Introduced**: Test system adaptability to change.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Average tardiness (hours)
- WIP level (jobs in system)
- Machine utilization (%)
- Lead time variability (standard deviation)
- Customer lead time accuracy (predictive)

**Expected Outcome**:  
The **hybrid EDDR + Predictive** strategy is expected to outperform all others in **tardiness reduction ( 50%)** and **WIP reduction ( 30%)**, while maintaining high machine utilization.

---

### **Framework for Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation**

We implement a **closed-loop scheduling system** using ongoing process mining:

1. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**:  
   - Tracks WIP, queue lengths, task durations, setup times, and tardiness in real time.  
   - Alerts when a job is delayed by >2 hours or when a machine is idle for >30 minutes.

2. **KPI Tracking & Drift Detection**:  
   - Uses **statistical process control (SPC)** to monitor KPIs (e.g., average lead time, tardiness rate).  
   - If a key metric drifts >5% from baseline, triggers an alert.

3. **Automated Rule Tuning**:  
   - Uses **online learning (e.g., reinforcement learning)** to adjust weights in the dispatching rule based on performance.  
   - For example, if late jobs increase, the system increases weight for due date (w).

4. **Periodic Review Cycles (Monthly)**:  
   - Re-analyze logs to detect new patterns (e.g., new job types, new setup patterns).  
   - Retrain clustering models or update the setup time matrix.

5. **Feedback Loop to Scheduling Engine**:  
   - New insights (e.g., a new job type has long setup times) are fed back into the dispatching rule or batching strategy.
