To infer the case groupings (i.e., which events belong to the same patient journey), we can use the following attributes as clues:
1. **Patient demographics**: `patient_age` and `patient_gender` (since these are unique to each patient).
2. **Logical sequence of activities**: Events for a single patient should follow a coherent medical workflow (e.g., registration  triage  consultation  treatment  discharge).
3. **Department consistency**: While patients may move between departments, the sequence should be logical (e.g., ER  Radiology  ER for an ER case).
4. **Timing**: Events for the same patient should be close in time (though not strictly, as some steps may take longer).

### Step-by-Step Grouping:
1. **Identify unique patient combinations**:
   - Patient 1: `age=45, gender=M` (ER, private insurance)
   - Patient 2: `age=62, gender=F` (ER, public insurance)
   - Patient 3: `age=28, gender=M` (Surgery, private insurance)

2. **Trace each patient's journey**:
   - **Patient 1 (45, M)**:
     - Event 1: Register patient (ER)
     - Event 4: Initial triage (ER)
     - Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology)
     - Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosis)
     - Event 15: Patient discharged (ER)
     - *Note*: This patient's journey is entirely in ER/Radiology, with no overlap with other departments.

   - **Patient 2 (62, F)**:
     - Event 2: Register patient (ER)
     - Event 5: Initial triage (ER)
     - Event 8: Lab test requested (ER)
     - Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory)
     - Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosis)
     - Event 14: Prescription created (ER)
     - Event 17: Patient discharged (ER)
     - *Note*: This patient's journey is entirely in ER/Laboratory, with no overlap with other departments.

   - **Patient 3 (28, M)**:
     - Event 3: Register patient (Surgery)
     - Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery)
     - Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery)
     - Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery)
     - Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery)
     - Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery)
     - *Note*: This patient's journey is entirely in Surgery, with no overlap with other departments.

3. **Verify no overlaps or ambiguities**:
   - No two patients share the same `age` and `gender` combination.
   - No events are left unassigned (all 18 events are accounted for).
   - The sequences are logically consistent (e.g., no ER patient suddenly appears in Surgery without context).

### Final Case Groupings:
- **Case 1 (45, M, ER)**:
  Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- **Case 2 (62, F, ER)**:
  Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- **Case 3 (28, M, Surgery)**:
  Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

### Summary:
The events can be grouped into 3 distinct cases based on unique patient demographics and coherent workflows:
1. **ER Patient (45, M)**: Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15.
2. **ER Patient (62, F)**: Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17.
3. **Surgery Patient (28, M)**: Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18.
