It’s a BPMN swimlane diagram that maps how a shop prepares a shipment. There are three lanes: Logistics (top), Dispatch of goods/secretary (middle), and Warehouse (bottom).

Main flow
- Start: Ship goods.
- A parallel gateway splits the work:
  - Warehouse lane
    - Package goods.
    - A noninterrupting timer on this task (48 hours) triggers Notify customer about delay if packaging takes too long.
    - Packaging completion and the optional delay notification join at an inclusive gateway.
  - Dispatch/secretary lane
    - Clarify shipment method (uses Order details).
    - Decision: Special handling?
      - Yes: Get 3 offers from logistic companies  Select logistic company and place order.
      - No: Check if insurance is required (uses Customer information)  inclusive split:
        - If insurance necessary: Logistics lane performs Insure parcel.
        - Always: Write package label.
        - These two rejoin at an inclusive gateway.
    - The “special handling” path and the “no special handling” path merge at an exclusive gateway.

- When both the admin/logistics branch and the warehouse branch are finished, a parallel join leads to:
  - Fill out shipment paperwork  Move package to pickup area  End: Shipment prepared.

Gateway meanings used: plus = parallel, X = exclusive, O = inclusive.
