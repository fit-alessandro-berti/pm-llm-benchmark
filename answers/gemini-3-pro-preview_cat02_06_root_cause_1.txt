Based on the analysis of the provided event log, here are the findings regarding the performance issues within the Customer Support Ticket Resolution process.

### 1. Identification of Cases with Longer Resolution Times

To identify outliers, we first calculate the **Total Cycle Time** (duration from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket") for each case:

*   **Case 103:** ~1.3 hours (08:10 to 09:30 on Mar 1) — *Fastest*
*   **Case 101:** ~2.25 hours (08:00 to 10:15 on Mar 1) — *Fast*
*   **Case 104:** ~24.2 hours (08:20 Mar 1 to 08:30 Mar 2) — **Delayed**
*   **Case 102:** ~25.2 hours (08:05 Mar 1 to 09:15 Mar 2) — **Delayed**
*   **Case 105:** ~49.1 hours (08:25 Mar 1 to 09:30 Mar 3) — **Significantly Delayed**

**Conclusion:** Cases **102, 104, and 105** are taking significantly longer (24–49 hours) compared to the standard performance of roughly 1–2 hours seen in Cases 101 and 103.

### 2. Root Causes of Performance Issues

By examining the timestamps between activities, specific bottlenecks and root causes become apparent:

**A. The "Escalation Black Hole" (Level-2 Availability)**
*   **Pattern:** In **Case 105**, the ticket was escalated to a Level-2 Agent on March 1st at 10:00. However, the "Investigate Issue" activity did not begin until March 2nd at 14:00.
*   **Root Cause:** There was a **28-hour wait time** simply sitting in the Level-2 queue before anyone looked at it. This suggests the specialized team is understaffed or has a massive backlog.

**B. Inefficient Triage and "Double Handling"**
*   **Pattern:** In **Case 105**, the ticket was assigned to L1, investigated by L1, and *then* escalated.
*   **Root Cause:** The initial Triage phase failed to identify the complexity of the issue. Time was wasted by an L1 agent investigating a ticket they could not solve, adding unnecessary steps before the ticket eventually entered the delayed L2 pipeline.

**C. Queue Wait Times at Level-1**
*   **Pattern:** In **Case 104**, the ticket was assigned to an L1 agent at 09:30, but the investigation didn't start until 13:00.
*   **Root Cause:** There was a **3.5-hour delay** between assignment and action. This suggests that even Level-1 agents are juggling too many tickets or are not picking up assigned tickets promptly.

**D. Overnight Delays (Business Hour Limitations)**
*   **Pattern:** In Cases **102, 104, and 105**, the time between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" spans across different dates (e.g., Investigate at 14:00, Resolve next day at 09:00).
*   **Root Cause:** The process does not appear to have 24/7 coverage (or effective handovers). If a ticket is not resolved by the end of the work day, it sits idle for approximately 15–18 hours overnight, drastically inflating the total resolution time.

### 3. Insights and Recommendations

The data indicates that the process works efficiently for simple issues but breaks down when queues pile up or complexity increases.

**How these factors lead to increased cycle times:**
The combination of **wait times in queues** (specifically the 28-hour L2 wait) and **overnight holds** creates a compounding effect. A ticket delayed by a few hours in the morning (Case 104) misses the "resolution window" for that day, forcing it into the next day, which automatically adds 15+ hours of non-value-added time to the clock.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Review Level-2 Staffing and SLAs:** The 28-hour wait time for L2 investigation (Case 105) is the most critical bottleneck. Management should investigate if L2 is understaffed or if the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for internal escalations needs to be enforced more strictly.
2.  **Improve the Triage Phase:** Enhance the triage guidelines or implementation (perhaps using AI or more experienced staff at the triage step) to route complex tickets directly to Level-2. This avoids the "Double Handling" seen in Case 105, where L1 wastes time on issues they cannot fix.
3.  **Implement End-of-Shift Handovers:** To address the overnight delays (seen in Case 102 and 104), implement a "follow-the-sun" model or a handover process where unfinished tickets are passed to a team in a different time zone, rather than sitting idle for 15 hours.
4.  **Analyze L1 Workload Balancing:** For Case 104, an L1 agent sat on an assigned ticket for 3.5 hours. The assignment logic should be reviewed—tickets should not be assigned to agents who are already at capacity; instead, they should remain in a general pool until an agent is actually ready to "Investigate."
