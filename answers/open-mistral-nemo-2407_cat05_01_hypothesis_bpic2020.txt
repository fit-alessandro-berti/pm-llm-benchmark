8. **Why are there variants where the declaration is rejected by the supervisor after being approved by the administration? (70)**
   - Follow-up: Can we identify common reasons for these rejections and address them?

9. **What is the impact of involving a pre-approver in the process? (65)**
   - Follow-up: Does it increase or decrease the time taken for final approval, and how does it affect the payment amount?

10. **Why are there variants where the declaration is rejected by the budget owner after being approved by the administration? (65)**
    - Follow-up: Can we understand the reasons behind these rejections and address any underlying issues?

11. **What is the average time taken for a declaration to be handled after being final-approved by the supervisor? (60)**
    - Follow-up: How does this compare to the time taken for other process steps?

12. **Why are there variants where the declaration is rejected by the missing category? (55)**
    - Follow-up: Can we understand what this category refers to and address the underlying issue?

13. **What is the impact of the number of rejections on the final payment amount? (55)**
    - Follow-up: Is there a correlation between the number of rejections and the final payment amount?

14. **Why are there variants where the declaration is rejected multiple times before being final-approved? (50)**
    - Follow-up: Can we identify patterns or common issues leading to these multiple rejections?

15. **What is the average time taken for a declaration to be handled after being submitted by the employee? (45)**
    - Follow-up: How does this compare to the time taken for other process steps?

16. **Why are there variants where the declaration is saved and then submitted again? (40)**
    - Follow-up: Can we understand the reasons behind this and address any underlying issues?

17. **What is the impact of the declaration amount on the process variant taken? (35)**
    - Follow-up: Is there a correlation between the declaration amount and the process variant taken?

18. **Why are there variants where the declaration is rejected by the employee after being rejected by another role? (30)**
    - Follow-up: Can we understand the reasons behind these rejections and address any underlying issues?

19. **What is the average time taken for a declaration to be handled after being approved by the administration? (25)**
    - Follow-up: How does this compare to the time taken for other process steps?

20. **Why are there variants where the declaration is rejected by multiple roles before being final-approved? (20)**

These questions aim to help understand the process better, identify bottlenecks, and suggest improvements. The confidence scores are based on the assumption that more frequent and higher-performing variants are more relevant for process improvement. However, the actual relevance of these questions may vary depending on the specific context and goals of the organization.
