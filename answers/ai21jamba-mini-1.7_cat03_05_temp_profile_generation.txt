Here is a representative temporal profile dictionary for the global supply chain process described:

```python
{
    ('SS', 'OP'): (3 * 24 * 3600, 12 * 3600),  # Average 3 days, Standard deviation 12 hours
    ('OP', 'RC'): (2 * 24 * 3600, 4 * 3600),  # Average 2 days, Standard deviation 4 hours
    ('RC', 'QI'): (1 * 24 * 3600, 6 * 3600),  # Average 1 day, Standard deviation 6 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (10 * 3600, 2 * 3600),  # Average 10 hours, Standard deviation 2 hours
    ('CA', 'PT'): (5 * 3600, 1 * 3600),  # Average 5 hours, Standard deviation 1 hour
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3 * 3600, 30 * 60),  # Average 3 hours, Standard deviation 30 minutes
    ('PK', 'WS'): (4 * 3600, 1 * 3600),  # Average 4 hours, Standard deviation 1 hour
    ('WS', 'DT'): (2 * 24 * 3600, 6 * 3600),  # Average 2 days, Standard deviation 6 hours
    ('DT', 'AS'): (7 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Average 7 days, Standard deviation 3 days
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Activity Pairs**: Each key in the dictionary represents a pair of activities (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')` indicates the time between Supplier Selection and Order Placement).
2. **Average Time**: Represents the estimated average delay between activities based on observed process executions.
3. **Standard Deviation**: Denotes the dispersion of observed delays around the average.

This temporal profile accounts for the complex dependencies across multiple steps in the supply chain process, providing a basis for analyzing and optimizing process performance.
