Normative “Hire-to-Retire” backbone  
Post Job Ad  Screen Candidates  Conduct Interviews  Make Hiring Decision  Onboard Employee  Add to Payroll  Close Case

This order reflects the logical, legal and administrative dependencies of hiring an employee; each step must happen once and in that sequence, and none of the core steps may be skipped.

-------------------------------------------------
Model 1 – anomalies detected
1. Missing precedence Interview  Decision  
   • Screening precedes both Decision and Interview, but there is no relation between Interview and Decision.  
   • Result: the hiring decision can be taken before (or even without) interviewing anyone, or interviews may be conducted long after the person has been hired, onboarded and paid.
2. Orphan-style Interview  
   • Because Interview is not ordered with any activity that follows Decision, it can legally run after Onboard, Payroll or even Close, contradicting business reality.
3. Mandatory but misplaced, never skipped  
   • All seven activities are mandatory and Payroll cannot be omitted, so salary payment and case closure are at least guaranteed.

Except for the position of “Conduct Interviews”, the rest of the flow (Post  Screen  Decision  Onboard  Payroll  Close) is intact, and no essential step can disappear.

-------------------------------------------------
Model 2 – anomalies detected
1. Screening may happen too late  
   • Post  Screen and Post  Interview edges allow Interview to start immediately after posting; Screening is no longer a prerequisite for either Interview or Decision.  
   • Decision only depends on Interview, so it can be taken while candidates are still being screened.
2. Payroll can be skipped entirely  
   • xor_payroll = XOR{Payroll, }. Choosing the silent branch means the new hire is never added to payroll—an obvious breach of compliance and labour law.
3. Infinite or multiple Onboarding cycles  
   • loop_onboarding = *(Onboard, ) lets the process repeat onboarding any number of times (including zero extra iterations). While less critical, it is ill-fitting for a one-off HR onboarding.
4. Same “orphan” risk for Screening  
   • Screening has no outgoing edge; it can legally execute after Decision, Onboard, Payroll or even Close.

Which model is closer to the normative process?

Model 1 is the better approximation.

Reasoning

• It preserves every mandatory step in the canonical order except for the relative position of “Conduct Interviews”.  
• All indispensable activities (Decision, Onboard, Payroll, Close) are enforced and can each occur only once.  
• Although interviewing after hiring is a serious procedural flaw, the error concerns timing only; the act of interviewing is still compulsory.

Model 2, in contrast, allows two fundamental violations:

1. A hired employee might never be paid (Payroll branch may be skipped).  
2. Key vetting (Screening) can trail or even follow the hiring decision, undermining due-diligence obligations.

Additionally, the possibility of looping onboarding introduces needless complexity, whereas Model 1 remains single-pass.

Because Model 1 retains the essential “hire-then-pay-then-close” backbone and never drops activities, its anomalies are less severe than Model 2’s omissions of payroll and proper pre-hire checks.
