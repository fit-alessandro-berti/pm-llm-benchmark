```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS c
ON e.case_id = c.case_id
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

This subquery counts events per `case_id` and keeps only those with 6 or fewer events; the outer query then returns all events for those cases.
