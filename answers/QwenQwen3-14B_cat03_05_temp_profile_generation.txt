Okay, I need to create a temporal profile dictionary for the supply chain process described. Let me start by recalling the activities involved: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. The task is to find all possible pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in some execution, not just direct next steps. For each such pair, I need to estimate the average time and standard deviation between them.

First, I should list all possible pairs. Since there are 10 activities, the total number of ordered pairs (excluding same activity pairs) is 10*9=90. But the prompt says to provide a representative subset, so I don't need to include all 90. However, I should ensure that the pairs included are those that are likely to appear in the process, even if they are separated by multiple steps.

Let me think about the process flow. The typical order is SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS. But in reality, there might be variations. For example, after DT, AS might happen, but maybe sometimes AS is done after PK or even after WS. Also, some steps might be repeated or have different sequences. But for the sake of this task, I'll assume the main flow.

Now, considering pairs that are not directly connected. For example, SS and OP are directly connected, but SS and RC are separated by OP. Similarly, SS and QI are separated by OP and RC. So the pairs (SS, OP), (SS, RC), (SS, QI), etc., should be included.

I need to pick a subset that covers different stages. Let me think of some key pairs:

1. (SS, OP): Direct next step. Average time might be a few days for selection and order placement.
2. (SS, RC): SS to RC would involve OP and RC. Maybe a week or so, with higher variance.
3. (OP, RC): Direct next step, maybe 1-2 weeks for delivery.
4. (OP, QI): OP to QI would be after RC. So maybe after OP, RC takes time, then QI. So the average time between OP and QI would be the sum of OP to RC and RC to QI. But since these are averages, maybe OP to QI is around 2 weeks?
5. (RC, QI): Direct step, maybe a few days.
6. (RC, CA): RC to CA would involve QI and then CA. So maybe a few weeks.
7. (QI, CA): Direct step, maybe a few days.
8. (CA, PT): Direct step, maybe a few days.
9. (CA, PK): After CA, PT is done first, then PK. So CA to PK would be PT time plus PK time. Maybe a week or so.
10. (PT, PK): Direct step, a day or two.
11. (PK, WS): Direct step, maybe a day.
12. (WS, DT): Direct step, maybe a few days to a week for shipping.
13. (DT, AS): Direct step, maybe after delivery, a few days for support.
14. (SS, AS): This would be a long time, spanning all steps. Maybe months.
15. (OP, DT): OP to DT would involve RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT. So a long time, maybe a few weeks.
16. (RC, AS): Similarly, after RC, all steps until AS. Could be a couple of weeks.
17. (QI, AS): QI to AS would be after CA, PT, PK, WS, DT. Maybe a few weeks.
18. (CA, AS): After CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. Maybe 2-3 weeks.
19. (PT, AS): After PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. Maybe a couple of weeks.
20. (PK, AS): PK to AS would be WS, DT, AS. Maybe a few days to a week.
21. (WS, AS): After WS, DT and then AS. Maybe a few days.
22. (DT, AS): Direct step, maybe a few days.
23. (SS, DT): SS to DT would be all steps up to DT. Maybe a few weeks.
24. (SS, PK): SS to PK would be all steps up to PK. Maybe a few weeks.

But I need to make sure the pairs are those that actually follow each other in some trace. For example, SS might not follow AS, since AS is after DT. So the pairs need to be in the correct order.

Also, the standard deviation should be based on the variability. For example, if the average is a long time, the standard deviation might be larger. For example, SS to AS could have a higher standard deviation due to various factors like supplier delays, testing times, etc.

Let me start constructing the dictionary with these pairs, estimating the average times and standard deviations. I'll need to make sure the units are in seconds, as per the example. Let's convert days, weeks, etc., into seconds.

Assuming:

- 1 day = 86400 seconds
- 1 week = 604800 seconds
- 1 month  2,592,000 seconds (30 days)
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds

Now, let's assign values:

1. ('SS', 'OP'): Average might be 1 day (86400), standard deviation 1 day (86400). But maybe lower, like 1 day average with 12 hours (43200) SD.
Wait, the example given in the prompt had average 86400 and SD 3600. So for a 1-day average, SD could be 1 hour. Let me think.

For direct steps like SS to OP, which is a quick decision, maybe average is 1 day (86400), SD 12 hours (43200). But the example had SD as 3600 (1 hour). Maybe for direct steps, the SD is smaller. For steps with longer delays, the SD could be larger.

Alternatively, for SS to OP, maybe average is 1 day, SD 6 hours (21600). But I need to be consistent.

Alternatively, for direct steps, average time is 1 day, SD 1 day. For steps that are further apart, the average time is longer, and SD could be higher.

But I need to make sure that the values are realistic. Let me proceed with some estimates:

- ('SS', 'OP'): average 1 day (86400), SD 6 hours (21600)
- ('SS', 'RC'): SS to RC involves OP and RC. Let's say average is 7 days (604800), SD 3 days (259200)
- ('OP', 'RC'): average 7 days, SD 3 days
- ('OP', 'QI'): OP to QI is OP to RC (7 days) + RC to QI (say 1 day). So average 8 days (691200), SD maybe 4 days (345600)
- ('RC', 'QI'): average 1 day (86400), SD 6 hours (21600)
- ('RC', 'CA'): RC to CA involves QI and CA. Let's say average is 10 days (864000), SD 5 days (432000)
- ('QI', 'CA'): average 3 days (259200), SD 1 day (86400)
- ('CA', 'PT'): average 2 days (172800), SD 1 day (86400)
- ('CA', 'PK'): CA to PK is CA to PT (2 days) + PT to PK (1 day)  3 days (259200), SD 2 days (172800)
- ('PT', 'PK'): average 1 day (86400), SD 6 hours (21600)
- ('PK', 'WS'): average 1 day (86400), SD 6 hours (21600)
- ('WS', 'DT'): average 3 days (259200), SD 1 day (86400)
- ('DT', 'AS'): average 1 day (86400), SD 6 hours (21600)
- ('SS', 'AS'): SS to AS is the entire process, maybe 3 weeks (15 days)  1296000 seconds, SD 5 days (432000)
- ('OP', 'DT'): OP to DT is OP to RC (7 days) + RC to QI (1 day) + QI to CA (3 days) + CA to PT (2 days) + PT to PK (1 day) + PK to WS (1 day) + WS to DT (3 days)  total 18 days (1555200), SD maybe 7 days (604800)
- ('RC', 'AS'): RC to AS is RC to QI (1 day) + QI to CA (3 days) + CA to PT (2 days) + PT to PK (1 day) + PK to WS (1 day) + WS to DT (3 days) + DT to AS (1 day)  total 12 days (1036800), SD 5 days (432000)
- ('QI', 'AS'): QI to AS is QI to CA (3 days) + CA to PT (2 days) + PT to PK (1 day) + PK to WS (1 day) + WS to DT (3 days) + DT to AS (1 day)  total 11 days (950400), SD 4 days (345600)
- ('CA', 'AS'): CA to AS is CA to PT (2 days) + PT to PK (1 day) + PK to WS (1 day) + WS to DT (3 days) + DT to AS (1 day)  8 days (691200), SD 3 days (259200)
- ('PT', 'AS'): PT to AS is PT to PK (1 day) + PK to WS (1 day) + WS to DT (3 days) + DT to AS (1 day)  6 days (518400), SD 2.5 days (216000)
- ('PK', 'AS'): PK to AS is PK to WS (1 day) + WS to DT (3 days) + DT to AS (1 day)  5 days (432000), SD 2 days (172800)
- ('WS', 'AS'): WS to AS is WS to DT (3 days) + DT to AS (1 day)  4 days (345600), SD 1.5 days (129600)
- ('DT', 'AS'): already included, average 1 day
- ('SS', 'DT'): SS to DT is SS to OP (1 day) + OP to RC (7 days) + RC to QI (1 day) + QI to CA (3 days) + CA to PT (2 days) + PT to PK (1 day) + PK to WS (1 day) + WS to DT (3 days)  total 18 days (1555200), same as OP to DT? Wait, no, SS to DT would be all steps up to DT, which is 1+7+1+3+2+1+1+3 = 19 days? Let me recalculate:

SS to OP: 1 day

OP to RC: 7 days

RC to QI: 1 day

QI to CA: 3 days

CA to PT: 2 days

PT to PK: 1 day

PK to WS: 1 day

WS to DT: 3 days

Total: 1+7=8, +1=9, +3=12, +2=14, +1=15, +1=16, +3=19 days  19*86400 = 1,641,600 seconds. SD could be 6 days (518400).

So adding that as ('SS', 'DT'): (1641600, 518400)

Similarly, other pairs. I need to make sure that all pairs are in the correct order. For example, ('AS', 'SS') is not possible since AS comes after SS. So all pairs must be in the order they appear in the process.

Now, compiling all these into the dictionary. Let me list them out with the estimated values:

{
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 21600),  # 1 day avg, 6 hours SD
    ('SS', 'RC'): (604800, 259200),  # 7 days avg, 3 days SD

    ('RC', 'AS'): (1036800, 432000),  # 12 days
    ('QI', 'CA'): (259200, 86400),  # 3 days
    ('QI', 'PT'): (345600, 129600),  # 4 days
    ('QI', 'PK'): (345600, 129600),
    ('QI', 'WS'): (432000, 172800),
    ('QI', 'DT'): (777600, 345600),  # 9 days
    ('QI', 'AS'): (950400, 345600),  # 11 days
    ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 86400),  # 2 days
    ('CA', 'PK'): (259200, 172800),  # 3 days
    ('CA', 'WS'): (345600, 172800),  # 4 days

    ('WS', 'AS'): (345600, 129600),  # 4 days
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 21600),  # 1 day
}

Wait, but I need to check if all these pairs are valid and follow the order. For example, ('SS', 'QI') would require that in some trace, SS is followed by QI, which would mean that OP and RC are skipped? That's unlikely. So maybe that pair shouldn't be included. Because in reality, SS is followed by OP, then RC, then QI. So SS to QI would only occur if there's a trace where SS is followed by QI without OP and RC. But in the given process, that's not the case. So perhaps I should not include pairs that are not in the correct order. Wait, the prompt says "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution." So if in some execution, SS is followed by QI (maybe in a different process variation), then it's allowed. But in the standard process, that's not the case. However, the problem says to consider the pairs that appear in the event logs. So if the logs have such a pair, it's included. But since the user hasn't provided specific logs, I need to assume that some variations exist where steps are skipped or reordered.

But this is getting complicated. To keep it simple, I'll focus on the main flow and include pairs that are separated by a few steps. For example, SS to RC, SS to QI (assuming in some case, maybe a rush order where OP is skipped? Unlikely, but possible for the sake of the model). Alternatively, maybe some steps are done in parallel, but the problem says "eventually follow each other", so even if they are not directly connected but appear in order in some trace.

But given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the pairs I listed earlier, ensuring that the first activity in the tuple comes before the second in the process. For example, ('SS', 'QI') is allowed if there's a trace where SS is followed by QI, even if it's not the main flow.

Now, I'll check if the dictionary I have includes such pairs. For example, ('SS', 'QI') is included. Also, ('SS', 'CA'), etc. However, some of these may have very large averages. For example, ('SS', 'AS') is 15 days, which seems reasonable.

Another thing to note: the standard deviation should be a positive number, and for each pair, it's based on the variability of the time between those two activities. For example, for direct steps, the SD is smaller, while for steps that are further apart, the SD might be larger due to accumulated variations from intermediate steps.

I think this is a reasonable approach. Now, I'll compile the dictionary with these pairs, ensuring that the keys are tuples of the activity pairs and the values are tuples of (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds.

### **Explanation of Key Assumptions and Design Choices**
- **Time Estimation**: Times are estimated based on typical supply chain processes. For example, supplier selection to order placement might take a day, while receiving components could take a week.
- **Standard Deviation**: Variability increases for pairs separated by more steps due to accumulated uncertainties (e.g., delays in procurement, testing, or shipping).
- **Representative Subset**: The dictionary includes pairs from early to late stages of the process, ensuring coverage of direct and indirect relationships (e.g., `('SS', 'AS')` for end-to-end delays).
- **Units**: All values are in seconds for consistency with the example provided in the prompt.
