Where bias shows up  
1. Attribute selection  
   • CommunityGroup and LocalResident are included in the data that feeds the scoring / decision rules, even though they say nothing about the applicant’s ability to repay.  
   • All other variables in the log (PreliminaryScore, validation results, etc.) are neutral, but these two social-location attributes are not.  

2. How the bias is implemented  
   • Whenever CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club” **and** LocalResident = TRUE, the Scoring Engine adds “+10 (Community)” to the PreliminaryScore.  
   • No other group or geography receives a comparable uplift; all “None” values get “0”.  
   • The rules engine accepts scores as low as 700 if the +10 uplift is present (Case C004), but seems to require 720 when no uplift is present (compare C002 vs. C003).

3. Concrete evidence in the log  
   Case C003  
     – Non-resident, no group, score 715  Rejected.  
   Case C004  
     – Resident + darts club, raw score 690 (+10 = 700)  Approved.  
   • The only substantive difference between C003 and C004 is the presence of the favored community attribute.  
   • C001 (710  720) is also pushed over the informal 720 line by the same uplift.  
   • C002 (720, no uplift) scrapes through; if its underlying score had been 710 it would likely have been rejected, unlike C001.

4. Fairness implications  
   • Disparate impact on anyone who is  
     – Not a resident of the particular locality, or  
     – A resident but not part of the singled-out club (other clubs get no boost), or  
     – A non-resident with identical economic credentials.  
   • Because community membership and residency often correlate with race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic class, the rule can translate into indirect discrimination against protected groups.  
   • Applicants cannot realistically “opt in” to the benefit unless they move or join a particular social organization, which creates structural inequity.

5. Why it matters even when credit-worthiness is “similar”  
   • Applicants with virtually identical PreliminaryScores receive different outcomes solely due to a social affiliation.  
   • The adjustment overrides what appears to be the decision threshold (700 for the favored group, 720 for everyone else).  
   • This violates common fair-lending principles such as equal treatment and equal opportunity for equivalent risk.

6. Recommended mitigation  
   • Remove CommunityGroup (or any proxy) from the scoring inputs unless a demonstrably risk-predictive, legally permissible rationale exists.  
   • Re-train / calibrate the model and rule thresholds using only legitimate risk factors.  
   • Run disparate-impact tests (e.g., adverse-impact ratio, demographic parity) before deployment.  
   • Provide explainability reports to reviewers so they can spot and override unjustified boosts or penalties.
