The provided visualization is a flowchart that outlines a process or workflow. Here is a detailed description of the flowchart:

1. **Start Circle**: The process begins with a circle labeled "Start."

2. **Initial Decision**: The first decision point is a diamond shape with the text "New Project?" leading to two paths:
   - **Yes**: Leads to "Define Scope."
   - **No**: Leads to "Review Existing Project."

3. **Define Scope**: This step follows if the answer to "New Project?" is yes. It is represented by a rectangle.

4. **Identify Requirements**: After defining the scope, the next step is to identify requirements, represented by another rectangle.

5. **Decision - Requirements Complete?**: A diamond shape asking "Requirements Complete?" with two paths:
   - **Yes**: Leads to "Develop Project Plan."
   - **No**: Loops back to "Identify Requirements."

6. **Develop Project Plan**: This step follows if the requirements are complete. It is represented by a rectangle.

7. **Execute Project Plan**: The next step is to execute the project plan, represented by a rectangle.

8. **Decision - Project on Track?**: A diamond shape asking "Project on Track?" with two paths:
   - **Yes**: Leads to "Monitor and Control."
   - **No**: Leads to "Identify Issues."

9. **Monitor and Control**: This step follows if the project is on track. It is represented by a rectangle.

10. **Identify Issues**: If the project is not on track, issues need to be identified, represented by a rectangle.

11. **Resolve Issues**: After identifying issues, the next step is to resolve them, represented by a rectangle.

12. **Decision - Issues Resolved?**: A diamond shape asking "Issues Resolved?" with two paths:
    - **Yes**: Loops back to "Monitor and Control."
    - **No**: Loops back to "Identify Issues."

13. **Close Project**: Once the project is monitored and controlled successfully, the next step is to close the project, represented by a rectangle.

14. **End Circle**: The process ends with a circle labeled "End."

This flowchart provides a structured approach to managing a project, from initiation to closure, with decision points to ensure the project stays on track and issues are addressed promptly.
