This diagram is a BPMNstyle swimlane process map showing how a customer order moves through four departments—Sales, Production, Procurement and Warehouse—from Mondaymorning order receipt all the way to shipment and invoicing.  The key steps are:

1. Sales lane  
   • Start event (“Monday morning”)  
   • Task: Check order for completeness  
   • Exclusive gateway: Is the customer already in the database?  
     – If no, a task “Add customer to the database” writes to the DB.  
     – Either way, the flow rejoins.  
   • Task: Send order details (message) to Production and Procurement lanes  
   • Task: Draft invoice (end of Sales lane)  

2. Production lane  
   • Message start event: “Order details arrive” from Sales  
   • Parallel gateway: feed into “Plan production” task (and also into a materialcheck loop if needed)  
   • Exclusive gateway after planning: are materials faulty?  
     – If yes, notify Procurement (message flow) to trigger material replenishment  
     – If no, proceed to “Manufacture product”  
   • Message end event: “Product complete” sent to Warehouse  

3. Procurement lane  
   • Message start event: “Order details arrive” from Sales  
   • Subprocess (“Material Compensation”):  
     – Task “Order materials”  
     – (Possibly) Task “Return material” if a fault is discovered  
   • Task outside the subprocess: “Check materials”  
   • Exclusive gateway: are materials okay?  
     – If no, end the procurement flow via an “Order cancellation” end event  
     – If yes, send a message back to Production (“Material not faulty”)  

4. Warehouse lane  
   • Message start event: “Product complete” from Production  
   • Task: “Send product” to the customer (message end event “Product sent”)  
   • That “Product sent” message is also routed back up to Sales to inform the invoicing task  

Other notation highlights  
 • Solid arrows are sequence flows within each lane  
 • Dashed arrows are message flows between departments  
 • Circles with envelopes are message start/end events; plain circles are timer or normal start/end events  
 • Diamonds mark gateways (exclusive decision and parallel split/join)  
 • The dashed box in Procurement is an embedded subprocess for handling material compensation  

Overall, it’s an “OrdertoCash” workflow showing how an incoming order is validated, customer data is checked, production is scheduled (with material checks and potential procurement loops), the finished goods are shipped, and the invoice is drafted.
