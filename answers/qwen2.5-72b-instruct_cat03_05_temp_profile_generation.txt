Certainly! Below is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process. The dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs, considering pairs that may be separated by multiple steps. The average times and standard deviations are estimated based on typical lead times and variances in such processes.

### Explanation:
- **Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP)**: The initial step of selecting a supplier and placing an order typically takes around 1 day, with a standard deviation of 4 hours.
- **Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC)**: Receiving components from a supplier usually takes 4 days, with a significant standard deviation of 1 day.
- **Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI)**: Inspecting received components takes 8 hours on average, with a standard deviation of 2 hours.
- **Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA)**: The time from quality inspection to assembly is around 2 days, with a standard deviation of 12 hours.
- **Component Assembly (CA) to Product Testing (PT)**: Testing the assembled product takes 12 hours on average, with a standard deviation of 3 hours.
- **Product Testing (PT) to Packaging (PK)**: Packaging the final product takes 1 day, with a standard deviation of 6 hours.
- **Packaging (PK) to Warehouse Storage (WS)**: Storing the packaged product in the warehouse takes 12 hours on average, with a standard deviation of 3 hours.
- **Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT)**: Distribution from the warehouse takes 2 days, with a standard deviation of 12 hours.
- **Distribution (DT) to After-Sales Support (AS)**: Providing after-sales support after distribution takes 1 week on average, with a standard deviation of 1.75 days.

### Indirect Pairs:
- **Supplier Selection (SS) to Receive Components (RC)**: The total time from supplier selection to receiving components is estimated to be 5 days, with a standard deviation of 1.25 days.
- **Supplier Selection (SS) to Quality Inspection (QI)**: The time from supplier selection to quality inspection is around 5.33 days, with a standard deviation of 1.33 days.
- **Supplier Selection (SS) to After-Sales Support (AS)**: The total time from supplier selection to after-sales support is estimated to be 17.5 days, with a standard deviation of 4.375 days.
- **Order Placement (OP) to Product Testing (PT)**: The time from placing an order to product testing is around 6.375 days, with a standard deviation of 1.59375 days.
- **Component Assembly (CA) to Distribution (DT)**: The time from assembly to distribution is around 4.125 days, with a standard deviation of 1.03125 days.

These estimates provide a comprehensive temporal profile that captures the typical delays and variances in a complex global supply chain process.
