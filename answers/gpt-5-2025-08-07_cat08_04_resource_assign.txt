Below is a structured, endtoend approach to diagnose and optimize TechSolve’s resource assignment using process mining, targeted at reducing SLA breaches, reassignments, and skill misallocation while balancing workload.

1) Analyze resource behavior and assignment patterns

A. Data preparation and enrichment
- Canonicalize events: ensure each ticket has clear phases (Create  Assign Tier  Work Start  Work Complete  Escalate  Reassign  Resolve/Close).
- Identify queues: define queue wait as time from Assign X to Work X Start; service time as Work X Start to Work X End; handover time as from Reassign/Escalate to next Work Start.
- Resource calendars: import shifts/rosters to compute availability and utilization; mark off-hours.
- Skills and proficiency: normalize Agent Skills into a skill matrix (agent × skill × proficiency); add skill verification from certifications or historical performance.
- Ticket features: category, priority, CI/application, description keywords, channel, region/time, customer segment, and Required Skill (as observed or inferred).
- SLA metadata: target times (Response, Restoration), breach flags.

B. Metrics to compute (per agent, team, tier, skill, priority, and category)
- Workload distribution:
  - Tickets handled, hours of work, WIP per agent; arrival vs completion by hour/day.
  - Utilization = busy time / scheduled time; peak vs average.
- Processing performance:
  - Queue time to start work; service time; time to resolve; variance; P50/P90.
  - First-contact resolution (FCR) for L1: percent of L1 tickets closed without escalation.
  - Escalation rate and levels (L1L2, L1L3, L2L3).
  - Reassignment count per ticket; pingpong ratio (tickets with 2+ backandforth handovers).
- Fit-to-skill and skill utilization:
  - Skill match rate: percent of assignments where agent has the Required Skill.
  - Skill proficiency match: where assigned proficiency meets/exceeds inferred complexity.
  - Specialist skill utilization: time specialists spend on tasks requiring their top skills vs total time; skill waste = 1  (time on matched skill / total time).
- Ticket-type affinity:
  - Agent’s historical success/efficiency by category/skill/CI; L1 FCR by category/priority/channel.
- SLA impact:
  - SLA breach rate by tier, skill, agent, time of day; correlation with queue time, reassignment count, and mismatch.
- Intake quality:
  - Misclassification rate: initial required skill/category differing from final effective skill; impact on delays.

C. Process mining techniques
- Performance-enhanced process maps: overlay average wait and service times per path (e.g., L1EscalateL2 vs L1Resolve).
- Resource interaction/social networks:
  - Handover-of-work networks: agents/roles as nodes, edges weighted by handovers; detect pingpong loops or overcentralization (e.g., one L2 acting as a bottleneck hub).
  - Working-together/subcontracting views for within-tier collaboration.
- Role discovery:
  - Cluster resources by activity profiles and ticket types to reveal actual roles versus declared tiers; identify L1s operating like specialists or L2s doing L1 work.
- Conformance checking:
  - Compare to intended assignment logic (round-robin within tier, escalate on specific criteria). Measure violations (e.g., L2 work started without required skill; direct L1L3 jumps; repeated reassignments within a tier).

D. Skill utilization analysis
- Demand vs supply by skill:
  - Heatmap of hourly/weekly demand for each skill vs scheduled capacity with that skill.
- Effective use of specialists:
  - Share of specialist time on tickets not requiring their specialization; identify candidates for shift-left (knowledge/rules to L1).
- Over/under-specified skills:
  - Skills frequently requested but often resolved by non-specialists (potential over-labeling) and vice versa (under-labeling causing escalations).

2) Identify resource-related bottlenecks and issues

A. Pinpoint issues with quantified impact
- Skill scarcity bottlenecks:
  - Example analysis: Networking-Firewall tickets queue at L2 with avg queue time 2.3h vs overall 0.8h; utilization of Firewall specialists >90% during 9–12 and 14–16; 28% of P2 breaches occur in these windows.
- Reassignment delays:
  - Compute delta from Reassign/Escalate to next Work Start; quantify average added delay per reassignment (e.g., +38 minutes per reassignment; pingpong adds +1.7h on average).
- Incorrect initial assignments:
  - Misclassification rate (e.g., 22% of tickets tagged App-CRM later resolved with Database-SQL). Quantify that misclassified tickets have 1.6× queue time, 2.1× reassignment rate, and 1.4× breach probability.
- Overloaded/underutilized agents or teams:
  - Agents with sustained utilization >85% (queues grow, breach risk rises); others <45% with minimal specialized work; measure uneven distribution index (e.g., Gini coefficient for workload).
- Escalation behavior:
  - L1 FCR benchmark by category; detect agents with unusually high escalations controlling for mix; quantify opportunity for shift-left (e.g., 35% of L1 escalations in OS-WindowsServer resolved in <15 minutes by L2).
- SLA correlations:
  - Regression/SHAP analysis linking breach probability to predictors: total queue time, number of handovers, skill mismatch flag, priority, hour of day. Report effect sizes (e.g., each additional handover increases breach odds by 27%; mismatch increases by 54%).

B. Illustrative quantifications
- Percent of SLA breaches linked to skill mismatch: share of breached tickets where initial assignment lacked required skill (e.g., 41%).
- Impact of dispatcher/auto-assignment vs self-assignment:
  - Compare delays and breach rates across assignment origins.
- Tier-specific bottlenecks:
  - L2 App-CRM queue spikes after 10:00 due to nightly batch incidents, suggesting staffing misalignment.

3) Root cause analysis for assignment inefficiencies

Potential root causes and how to validate with process mining and data science:
- Assignment rules too naive:
  - Round-robin ignores skills/workload and SLA slack. Conformance checking shows frequent assignments to agents without required skill; decision mining reveals that current dispatcher choices do not consider queue or SLA due times.
- Inaccurate/incomplete skill profiles:
  - Many assignments succeed with “unknown” or unlisted skills; infer latent skills by mining successful resolutions and update profiles; mismatch between declared and effective skills drives reassignments.
- Poor initial categorization/required-skill identification:
  - Variant analysis: cases with smooth flow have consistent early categorization; variants with many reassignments show category changes in first two steps; text mining on descriptions predicts skills better than current Required Skill field in X% of cases.
- Lack of real-time workload visibility:
  - Handovers cluster to already busy specialists; queue-aware analysis shows dispatch disregards current backlog; EDD not used.
- Insufficient L1 empowerment:
  - Knowledge gaps visible where L2 resolves many short, low-complexity tasks; L1 FCR low for categories historically resolvable with scripted steps.
- Process policy gaps:
  - No reassignment guardrails; pingpong behavior; sticky ownership not enforced; reason codes for reassignment absent or uninformative.

4) Data-driven resource assignment strategies

Strategy 1: Skill- and proficiency-based routing with SLA-aware scoring
- Issue addressed: Mismatch assignments, reassignments, specialist misallocation, SLA breaches.
- Approach:
  - Build an assignment scoring function for each candidate agent:
    - SkillMatch (binary/graded by proficiency), Historical success for category/CI, Predicted effort, Current queue/availability, SLA slack (EDD), Affinity (handled customer/CI before), Time-of-day performance.
  - Choose agent maximizing score under constraints (must-have skills for certain categories/priors).
- Data required: Skill matrix with proficiency; per-agent performance by category/CI; real-time queue lengths and schedules; SLA deadlines; predictive effort models.
- Benefits: Higher first-pass fit, fewer reassignments, lower queue time; improved SLA adherence by prioritizing earliest due dates and shortest expected processing.

Strategy 2: Workload-aware, priority-driven dispatch (EDD + shortest expected processing time)
- Issue addressed: Uneven load, queues at specialists, rising P2/P3 breaches during peaks.
- Approach:
  - Centralized queue where tickets are pulled/pushed using:
    - Earliest Due Date (SLA) prioritization within priority class; tiebreak by Shortest Expected Processing Time (learned from history by category/skill/CI).
    - Capacity caps per agent; dynamic balancing to keep utilization in target band (e.g., 60–80%).
- Data required: SLA clocks; predicted handle time distributions; agent capacity; real-time WIP.
- Benefits: Lower waiting time for at-risk tickets; smoother utilization; reduced overload and breach rate for P2/P3.

Strategy 3: Predictive skill and tier classification at intake
- Issue addressed: Incorrect initial categorization and escalations.
- Approach:
  - NLP classifier on ticket description, category, CI, channel to predict required skill, complexity, and likely resolution tier.
  - Route directly to the most probable capable tier/agent; flag tickets with high escalation probability for senior L1 or L2 triage.
- Data required: Historical tickets with final skill/tier; text features; outcomes; feedback loop for retraining.
- Benefits: Fewer early misroutes, shorter time-to-first-correct-handler, reduced pingpong.

Strategy 4: Shift-left with targeted L1 enablement and guardrails
- Issue addressed: Specialists doing basic tasks; excessive escalations.
- Approach:
  - Identify “quick win” categories where L2 resolves fast; create guided runbooks and knowledge articles; surface recommendations in L1 console.
  - Escalation policy requires L1 to complete checklist for such categories; sticky ownership for the first N minutes.
  - Reassignment guardrails: reason codes, one-bounce limit per tier unless exception, automated skill check before reassignment.
- Data required: List of tasks with low median L2 service time; knowledge base; telemetry of L1 steps; reassignment metadata.
- Benefits: Higher L1 FCR, reduced L2 load, fewer reassignments.

Strategy 5: Dynamic skill pooling and schedule alignment
- Issue addressed: Time-windowed skill bottlenecks; underutilized agents.
- Approach:
  - Cross-train selected L1/L2 agents for recurring high-demand skills; create virtual cross-tier “surge pool” for peak hours.
  - Adjust shifts to align with demand heatmaps by skill and priority.
- Data required: Demand by hour/day per skill; cross-train candidate identification; scheduling system integration.
- Benefits: Reduced queue spikes, better utilization, improved P2/P3 SLA compliance.

Optional add-ons
- Dispatcher decision support UI with recommended assignees and rationale.
- “Sticky agent” for reopens and reassignments within same ticket to reduce rediscovery time.
- Affinity routing for specific customers/CI to agents with past success.

5) Simulation, implementation, and monitoring

A. Business process simulation before rollout
- Build a discrete-event simulation using mined process model:
  - Arrival processes by hour/day and priority; branching probabilities (escalation, reassignment) conditioned on categories.
  - Activity time distributions per tier/skill (fitted distributions, e.g., lognormal) and queue discipline.
  - Resource pools with skills, schedules, and utilization targets.
  - SLA timers and breach logic.
- Scenarios to test:
  - Baseline vs Strategy 1–5 individually and combined (A/B/C).
  - Sensitivity: changes in arrival volume, staffing, skill coverage, classifier accuracy.
- Outputs to compare:
  - SLA attainment by priority; average and P90 resolution time; queue times per tier; number of reassignments; utilization per agent/skill; overtime; cost per ticket.
- Use the best scenario for phased pilot.

B. Implementation roadmap
- Phase 1: Data foundation
  - Cleanse event log; integrate rosters; normalize skills; create ground-truth labels; implement reassignment reason codes.
- Phase 2: Diagnostics and design
  - Deliver dashboards; finalize routing score and predictive models; define policies and guardrails.
- Phase 3: Pilot
  - Limited scope (e.g., Network and App-CRM P2/P3) with parallel monitoring; feedback loop with agents.
- Phase 4: Scale and institutionalize
  - Automate assignment in ITSM tool; update knowledge processes; training and change management.

C. Post-implementation monitoring with process mining dashboards
- Resource KPIs (tier/agent/skill):
  - Utilization and WIP; queue time to start work; service time; on-shift adherence.
  - Reassignment rate and pingpong rate; average delay per reassignment.
  - L1 FCR overall and by category; escalation rate and time to escalate.
  - Skill match rate and specialist skill waste; demand vs capacity by skill; cross-train coverage.
- SLA and flow KPIs:
  - SLA attainment by priority; time-to-assign; time-to-resolve; P50/P90 tails.
  - Breach root causes: distribution by mismatch, reassignments, time windows.
- Predictive/leading indicators:
  - Real-time SLA risk score; backlog at risk by priority/skill; heatmap of current vs expected queues.
- Conformance and compliance:
  - Violations of assignment policy; unauthorized tier jumps; missed guardrails.
- Continuous improvement:
  - Control charts and alerts for metric drifts; monthly variant analysis to spot new bottlenecks; AB tests for rule changes.

Expected outcomes
- 15–30% reduction in reassignments through skill-aware, workload-aware routing.
- 20–40% reduction in P2/P3 SLA breaches by EDD and shortest expected time policies.
- 10–20% increase in L1 FCR for targeted categories via shift-left.
- More even workload distribution; specialist time reclaimed for complex cases.

This approach uses the event log to first expose the true resource dynamics and their impact on SLA, then applies predictive, skill-aware, and workload-balanced assignment strategies validated via simulation, and finally embeds continuous monitoring to sustain gains.
