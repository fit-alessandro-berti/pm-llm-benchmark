Absolutely, let's analyze the log and rename the ambiguous activities to clarify their different roles within each case. I'll focus on the activities that recur with different meanings across cases:  
- **Verify Documents**  
- **Call Customer**  
- **Submit Additional** (though this appears once per case, its meaning may differ depending on prior events)

Let's break down the context for each, then suggest clearer names.

---

## 1. **Verify Documents**

This activity appears in all three cases, but its meaning differs based on process stage and available context:

- **C001 (early in process)**:  
  *Context*: Initial verification of identity documents by a back office agent.  
  *Role*: Early-stage identity authentication.
- **C001 (later in process)**:  
  *Context*: Re-verification after the customer has submitted a scanned ID document (after an initial delay or missing document).  
  *Role*: Follow-up or secondary verification due to incomplete initial check.
- **C002 (early in process)**:  
  *Context*: Standard initial identity check.  
  *Role*: Standard first verification step.
- **C003 (first occurrence)**:  
  *Context*: Physical document verification at branch (officer checks ID in person).  
  *Role*: In-person, physical verification.
- **C003 (second occurrence, after adjustment)**:  
  *Context*: Re-verification following an account adjustment, possibly due to new or changed information.  
  *Role*: Post-adjustment verification to ensure compliance.

### Suggested Renamed Activity:  
**`Initial Identity Verification` / `Re-Verification of Documents` / `Physical Document Check` / `Post-Adjustment Document Validation`**

But for clarity in the log, we can use **contextual labels** per event. Since the log format doesn't support multi-value columns, let's use slightly different names for each distinct usage, but keep it concise.

**Proposed renaming for the log:**

| C001 | Initiate Request |  | | |  
|------|------------------|---|  
|      | Initiate Request |  
|      | **Initial Document Verification** | (Agent checks identity docs)  
|      | **Customer Call for Missing Docs** | (Agent calls to get missing docs)  
|      | **Submit Additional Document** | (Customer uploads ID scan)  
|      | **Re-Verification of Documents** | (Agent checks updated scan)  
|      | **Approve Request** |  

| C002 | Initiate Request |  |  
|------|------------------|---|  
|      | Initiate Request |  
|      | **Initial Document Verification** |  
|      | **Discrepancy Clarification Call** | (Outbound call to resolve account issue)  
|      | **Adjust Account Details** |  
|      | **Follow-up Customer Call** | (After adjustment to confirm)  
|      | **Approve Request** |  

| C003 | Initiate Request |  |  
|------|------------------|---|  
|      | Initiate Request |  
|      | **Physical ID Verification** | (At branch)  
|      | **Customer Left, Follow-up Call** | (Officer calls customer to return)  
|      | **Adjust Account Details (Internal)** |  
|      | **Re-Verification After Adjustment** | (After account update)  
|      | **Approve Request** |  

---

## 2. **Call Customer**

This activity appears in all cases, but its purpose changes:

- **C001**:  
  Made after initial verification failed (customer missing docs), so it's about requesting missing information.
- **C002**:  
  First call is to clarify a discrepancy found during verification.
  Second call is a follow-up after account adjustment to confirm changes.
- **C003**:  
  First call is due to the customer stepping out (requesting to return to re-verify).
  (No second call in this case.)

### Suggested Renamed Activity:

**`Request Information by Phone` / `Discrepancy Clarification Call` / `Follow-up Customer Call` / `Request to Return for Re-Verification`**

Again, for the log, let's tailor the names:

| C001 | ... |  
|------|-----|  
| ... | **Request Missing Document Details by Phone** |  
| C002 | ... |  
|      | **Discrepancy Clarification Call** |  
|      | **Follow-up Customer Call** |  
| C003 | ... |  
|      | **Customer Left, Follow-up Call** |  

## 3. **Submit Additional (Customer Submits Extra Document)**

This appears once per case, but the meaning depends on when it happens:

- In C001, it's after the agent requests more documents and the customer provides them.
- In C002 and C003, it's not present, but if it were, the context might differ (e.g., submitting extra supporting docs after a discrepancy was found).

Since it's only in C001, but to be thorough, we can rename it to make it clear it's "Customer Submits Additional Document" or "Upload Additional Supporting Document".

## 4. Final Revised Log with Contextual Activity Names

## **Justification of Renaming Choices**

- **Initial Document Verification / Re-Verification of Documents / Physical ID Verification:**  
  Distinguishes between the first check (either digital or in-person), the second check when information is incomplete, and the re-check after an adjustment.

- **Customer Call for Missing Documents / Discrepancy Clarification Call / Follow-up Customer Call / Customer Left, Follow-up Call:**  
  Highlights the purpose of the call—whether to request missing info, clarify a problem, follow up on changes, or prompt the customer to return for re-verification.

- **Upload Additional Supporting Document:**  
  Clarifies that this event is the customer providing extra evidence after being prompted.

These changes reduce ambiguity, making it clear what each activity accomplishes at its point in the process, even though the activity name is the same in the original log.
