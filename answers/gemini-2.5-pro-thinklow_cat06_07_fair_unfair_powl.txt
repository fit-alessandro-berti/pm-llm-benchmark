Here are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, as requested. The first model includes the potential for unfairness, while the second presents a revised, fairer process.

### Python Code for Generating POWL Models

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# --- 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness ---

# Define the individual activities (Transitions) based on the process description
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="PreliminarySkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_eval = Transition(label="CulturalFitEvaluation")
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck") # The biased activity
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Model the data completeness check as a loop
# The loop executes a DataCompletenessCheck (A). If it fails, it executes RequestMoreInfo (B) 
# and then repeats the check until it passes, at which point the loop is exited.
completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Model the biased evaluation stage as an XOR choice
# An applicant undergoes either a standard CulturalFitEvaluation OR a CommunityAffiliationCheck.
# This is the point where unfairness is introduced.
biased_evaluation_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_eval, community_check])

# Construct the top-level process as a StrictPartialOrder
# This defines the overall sequence of the hiring stages.
unfair_process_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_app,
    completeness_loop,
    skill_assessment,
    biased_evaluation_xor,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define the sequential order of execution for the unfair model
unfair_process_model.order.add_edge(receive_app, completeness_loop)
unfair_process_model.order.add_edge(completeness_loop, skill_assessment)
unfair_process_model.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, biased_evaluation_xor)
unfair_process_model.order.add_edge(biased_evaluation_xor, managerial_review)
unfair_process_model.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

print("--- POWL Model with Potential Unfairness ---")
print(unfair_process_model)
print("\nDescription: This model represents the described hiring process, including the XOR branch")
print("where 'CommunityAffiliationCheck' can provide an unfair advantage to certain applicants.")


# --- 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness ---

# We can reuse most of the activities defined earlier.
# The key change is removing the CommunityAffiliationCheck and the XOR operator.
# All applicants now go through the same 'CulturalFitEvaluation'.
fair_cultural_fit_eval = Transition(label="CulturalFitEvaluation") # Renamed for clarity, though it's the same activity

# Construct the fair process model as a StrictPartialOrder.
# Note that the 'biased_evaluation_xor' node is replaced with a single activity node.
fair_process_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_app,
    completeness_loop,
    skill_assessment,
    fair_cultural_fit_eval, # The single, fair evaluation step
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define the sequential order for the fair model
fair_process_model.order.add_edge(receive_app, completeness_loop)
fair_process_model.order.add_edge(completeness_loop, skill_assessment)
fair_process_model.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, fair_cultural_fit_eval)
fair_process_model.order.add_edge(fair_cultural_fit_eval, managerial_review)
fair_process_model.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

print("\n\n--- POWL Model Without Unfairness ---")
print(fair_process_model)
print("\nDescription: This model represents a revised, fair process where the biased XOR branch")
print("has been removed. All applicants undergo the same 'CulturalFitEvaluation'.")

```

### Explanation of the Models

#### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model accurately reflects the process described in the text, including its structural flaw.

*   **POWL Representation:**
    ```
    PO=(nodes={ ReceiveApplication, *( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo ), PreliminarySkillAssessment, X( CulturalFitEvaluation, CommunityAffiliationCheck ), ManagerialReview, FinalDecision }, order={ ReceiveApplication-->*( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo ), *( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )-->PreliminarySkillAssessment, PreliminarySkillAssessment-->X( CulturalFitEvaluation, CommunityAffiliationCheck ), X( CulturalFitEvaluation, CommunityAffiliationCheck )-->ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview-->FinalDecision })
    ```
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Loop:** The `*(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)` node models the initial data validation loop. An applicant's data is checked; if incomplete, more information is requested, and the check is repeated.
    *   **Sequence:** The overall process follows a strict sequence from application receipt to final decision.
    *   **Unfairness (XOR Branch):** The `X(CulturalFitEvaluation, CommunityAffiliationCheck)` node is the critical point of bias. It represents a choice where some candidates are routed to a standard evaluation while others receive preferential treatment via the `CommunityAffiliationCheck` path, thus creating an unfair process.

#### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model demonstrates how the process can be redesigned to eliminate the source of bias identified in the description.

*   **POWL Representation:**
    ```
    PO=(nodes={ ReceiveApplication, *( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo ), PreliminarySkillAssessment, CulturalFitEvaluation, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision }, order={ ReceiveApplication-->*( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo ), *( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )-->PreliminarySkillAssessment, PreliminarySkillAssessment-->CulturalFitEvaluation, CulturalFitEvaluation-->ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview-->FinalDecision })
    ```
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Bias Removed:** The `XOR` branch is eliminated. Instead of a choice, there is a single, mandatory `CulturalFitEvaluation` activity that all applicants must complete after the skill assessment.
    *   **Fairness by Design:** By removing the alternative path (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`), the model ensures that every applicant is assessed for cultural fit using the same standardized criteria, thereby designing the bias out of the process structure.
    *   **Shared Structure:** The model retains the necessary loop for data completeness and the overall sequential flow, demonstrating that fairness can be improved without overhauling the entire workflow.
