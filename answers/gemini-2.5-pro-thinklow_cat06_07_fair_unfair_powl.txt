Here are the two POWL models representing the described hiring process. The first model includes the potential for unfairness through an XOR branch, while the second model eliminates this bias by enforcing a single, standardized evaluation path.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model represents the hiring process where a subtle bias can be introduced. After the skill assessment, an XOR (exclusive choice) operator routes candidates to either a standard `CulturalFitEvaluation` or a biased `CommunityAffiliationCheck`. This biased path can give preferential treatment to certain applicants, creating an unfair advantage.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# --- Define the individual activities (Transitions) based on the description ---
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_evaluation = Transition(label="CulturalFitEvaluation")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck") # The biased path
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# --- Model the loop for ensuring data completeness ---
# The process executes a DataCompletenessCheck. If it fails, it requests more info
# and repeats the check. This is a classic loop structure.
# *(A, B) means: do A, then either exit or do B and repeat A.
loop_data_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# --- Model the XOR branch where bias is introduced ---
# After the skill assessment, the process branches.
# One path is the standard evaluation; the other is the biased check.
# This choice point is the source of the potential unfairness.
xor_bias_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_evaluation, community_affiliation_check])

# --- Construct the overall process flow using a StrictPartialOrder ---
# The nodes of our process are the activities and the complex operators (loop, xor).
nodes_unfair = [
    receive_application,
    loop_data_check,
    skill_assessment,
    xor_bias_check,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
]
powl_model_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_unfair)

# --- Define the sequence of execution by adding edges ---
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop_data_check)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_data_check, skill_assessment)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_bias_check)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_bias_check, managerial_review)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

print("--- 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness ---")
print(powl_model_unfair)
print("\nDescription: This model includes an XOR branch ('X') after the 'SkillAssessment'.")
print("This choice between a standard 'CulturalFitEvaluation' and a biased 'CommunityAffiliationCheck'")
print("is where unfair preferential treatment can occur.")

```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model represents a revised, fairer version of the hiring process. The biased XOR branch is removed. Instead, all applicants who pass the skill assessment proceed to a single, mandatory `CulturalFitEvaluation`. This ensures that every candidate is evaluated on the same criteria at this stage, eliminating the structural source of bias.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# --- Define the individual activities (Transitions) ---
# Note: CommunityAffiliationCheck is no longer needed as a separate, biased path.
receive_application_fair = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check_fair = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info_fair = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment_fair = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_evaluation_fair = Transition(label="CulturalFitEvaluation") # This is now the only path
managerial_review_fair = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision_fair = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# --- Model the loop for ensuring data completeness (same as before) ---
loop_data_check_fair = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check_fair, request_more_info_fair])

# --- Construct the overall process flow using a StrictPartialOrder ---
# The nodes no longer contain the XOR operator. The standard cultural fit
# evaluation is now a regular, sequential activity.
nodes_fair = [
    receive_application_fair,
    loop_data_check_fair,
    skill_assessment_fair,
    cultural_fit_evaluation_fair, # Replaces the XOR block
    managerial_review_fair,
    final_decision_fair
]
powl_model_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_fair)

# --- Define the sequence of execution for the fair process ---
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(receive_application_fair, loop_data_check_fair)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(loop_data_check_fair, skill_assessment_fair)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment_fair, cultural_fit_evaluation_fair)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_evaluation_fair, managerial_review_fair)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review_fair, final_decision_fair)


print("\n\n--- 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness ---")
print(powl_model_fair)
print("\nDescription: This model represents a fair process. The XOR branch has been removed.")
print("All candidates now follow the same path through a mandatory 'CulturalFitEvaluation',")
print("eliminating the structural opportunity for bias at this stage.")
