### Process Mining Analysis: Labeling Manufacturing Activities

Here, I analyze the event log to identify patterns and phases in the machine readings, grouping and labeling related events based on inferred high-level manufacturing activities.

### **Grouping and Labeling:**

#### **1. "Startup Phase" (Events 1–3)**

- **Patterns:** Little-to-no activity; stable and minimal sensor readings.
	- Temperature, Pressure, Vibration Level, Flow, and Energy consumption are all near baseline levels.
	- Machine is in standby or preparation state before actual operations begin.
- **Assigned Label:** **Startup**
- **Rationale:** Minimal readings across sensors suggest initialization or standby.

#### **2. "Cutting Metal" (Events 4–6)**

- **Patterns:** Rapid increase in Temperature, Pressure, Vibration Level, and Energy consumption.
	- Temperature rises sharply from 20°C to 58°C.
	- Vibration spikes (30–38 Hz) and Energy consumption increases (from 0.5 kWh to 3.0 kWh), indicating active mechanical work like cutting.
	- Pressure shows slight increases (1 bar to 1.5 bar) as the tool engages with material.
- **Assigned Label:** **Cutting Metal**
- **Rationale:** Elevated Vibration Level and Energy usage align with expected activity during cutting operations.

#### **3. "Assembling Parts" (Events 7–8)**

- **Patterns:** Stable moderate conditions; Material Flow is reduced but steady, and Energy usage is moderate.
	- Tool Position moves to 15 mm, suggesting controlled motion for assembly.
	- Vibration and Pressure stabilize, reflecting less intense activity.
- **Assigned Label:** **Assembling Parts**
- **Rationale:** Steady Material Flow and controlled Tool Position suggest precise maneuvering, consistent with clean assembly tasks.

#### **4. "Welding" (Event 9)**

- **Patterns:** Significant increase in Temperature (80°C) and Energy usage (5.0 kWh) with no Flow.
	- Tool Position remains at 15 mm, consistent with sustained pressure needed for welding.
	- Vibration Level significantly increases (50 Hz), indicating intense localized activity typical of welding.
- **Assigned Label:** **Welding**
- **Rationale:** High Temperature and Energy usage, combined with high Vibration Level and no Material Flow, suggest welding activity.

#### **5. "Quality Inspection" (Events 10–12)**

- **Patterns:** Temperature returns to a lower range (30°C, 25°C); Pressure, Flow, and Energy consumption decrease, yet moderate vibrations persist.
	- Moderate Vibration Level (5 Hz) may indicate sensors or instruments in use for inspection.
	- Energy consumption is lower compared to "Cutting" or "Welding."
- **Assigned Label:** **Quality Inspection**
- **Rationale:** Drop in intensity and moderate Vibration Level suggest inspection or quality checks.

#### **6. "Shutdown Phase" (Events 13–15)**

- **Patterns:** Return to near-baseline conditions after a brief increase in Vibration Level.
	- Vibration and Pressure stabilize at near-zero levels.
	- Energy usage decreases to initial values, indicating a shutdown.
- **Assigned Label:** **Shutdown**
- **Rationale:** Return to baseline readings suggests the machine is powered down or returning to an idle state.

### **Summary of Labels and Rationale:**

**Rationale**

1–3

08:00:00–08:00:10

**Startup**

Minimal activity indicates preparation.

4–6

08:00:15–08:00:25

**Cutting Metal**

Sharp increase in Vibration, Temperature, and Energy.

7–8

08:00:30–08:00:35

**Assembling Parts**

Stable Tool Position and consistent Material Flow.

9

08:00:40

**Welding**

High Temperature, Energy, and localized Vibration.

10–12

08:00:45–08:00:55

**Quality Inspection**

Moderate Vibration Level and reduced activity.

13–15

08:01:00–08:01:10

**Shutdown**

Return to baseline or near-zero conditions.

### **Conclusion:**

By analyzing sensor patterns and correlating changes in readings to logical manufacturing activities, the events were grouped into meaningful phases (Startup  Cutting Metal  Assembling Parts  Welding  Quality Inspection  Shutdown). This method of process mining from raw sensor data effectively highlights operational phases, even without explicit activity labels.
