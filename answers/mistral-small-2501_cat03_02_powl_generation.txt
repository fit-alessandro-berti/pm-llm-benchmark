To construct the POWL model for the described complex digital service provisioning process at a telecom company, we need to define the various activities, loops, choices, and partial orders using the appropriate classes and operators. Below is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual transitions
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification (SR)")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation (DA)")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization (ACI)")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration (BNC)")
DNR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment (CD)")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment (MD)")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance (QA)")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit (SA)")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")

# Define the loop for Base Network Configuration (BNC) and Debug & Reconfigure (DNR)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DNR])

# Define the choice for Containerized Deployment (CD) or Monolithic Deployment (MD)
choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Define the partial order for the entire process
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, choice, QA, SA, GLA])

# Adding order constraints
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, choice)
root.order.add_edge(choice, QA)
root.order.add_edge(choice, SA)
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Print the constructed POWL model
print(root)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Service Request Verification (SR)**: The process starts with verifying the service request.
2. **Contract Setup (CS)**: After SR, the contract setup must be done.
3. **Datacenter Allocation (DA) and Access Control Initialization (ACI)**: These two tasks can be done concurrently after CS.
4. **Loop for Base Network Configuration (BNC) and Debug & Reconfigure (DNR)**: This loop ensures that the base configuration is stable before proceeding.
5. **Choice for Deployment Method (CD or MD)**: After the loop, there is an exclusive choice between containerized deployment and monolithic deployment.
6. **Quality Assurance (QA) and Security Audit (SA)**: These tasks can be done in any order or concurrently after the deployment method is chosen.
7. **Go-Live Approval (GLA)**: This final step can only start after both QA and SA are completed.

The code constructs the POWL model by creating the necessary transitions, defining the loop and choice using `OperatorPOWL`, and adding the appropriate partial order constraints using `StrictPartialOrder`. The partial order ensures that the activities are executed in the correct sequence and allows for concurrent execution where specified.
