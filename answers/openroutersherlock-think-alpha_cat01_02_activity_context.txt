### Justification of Naming Choices
- **Verify Documents** (recurs in C001 and C003): Renamed to **Initial Document Verification** (first occurrence: always the early-stage check of identity/physical docs post-initiation, e.g., "Agent checks identity documents" or "Physical verification of ID"; positionally first, before interventions). **Follow-up Document Verification** (second occurrence: re-check after customer action or adjustment, e.g., "Agent re-checks... ID scan is provided" or "Re-verify... after account adjustment"; triggered by prior events like calls/submissions).
- **Call Customer** (recurs in C002; appears singly elsewhere): Renamed per instance to reflect purpose from context/resource/timing: **Call to Request Missing Documents** (C001: verification incomplete, explicitly requests docs). **Call to Clarify Discrepancy** (C002 first: "clarify account discrepancy," pre-adjustment). **Follow-up Confirmation Call** (C002 second: "follow-up... confirm adjustments," post-adjustment). **Call for Customer Return** (C003: customer absent, "calls to have them return"). This disambiguates the two in C002 and highlights role variations (e.g., request vs. confirm vs. recall).
Other activities (e.g., Initiate Request, Approve Request) do not recur within cases and have consistent roles, so unchanged. Names are concise, process-flow oriented, and directly derived from additional context, timestamps, and sequence.
