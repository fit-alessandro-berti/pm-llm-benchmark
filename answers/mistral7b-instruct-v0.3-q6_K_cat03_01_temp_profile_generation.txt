 Creating a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process involves making assumptions about the average times and standard deviations between different activities in the process. Here's an example of such a profile based on common steps in a P2P process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Request for Payment': 'Purchase Order Approval'): (2, 1),  # average and standard deviation in hours
    ('Purchase Order Approval': 'Goods Receipt'): (3, 2),
    ('Goods Receipt': 'Invoice Approval'): (1, 0.5),
    ('Invoice Approval': 'Payment Processing'): (2, 1),
    ('Payment Processing': 'Payment Completion'): (1, 0.5)
}
```

This temporal profile suggests the following average times and standard deviations between the activities in a P2P process:
- Request for Payment to Purchase Order Approval: 2 hours on average with a standard deviation of 1 hour
- Purchase Order Approval to Goods Receipt: 3 hours on average with a standard deviation of 2 hours
- Goods Receipt to Invoice Approval: 1 hour on average with a standard deviation of 0.5 hours
- Invoice Approval to Payment Processing: 2 hours on average with a standard deviation of 1 hour
- Payment Processing to Payment Completion: 1 hour on average with a standard deviation of 0.5 hours
