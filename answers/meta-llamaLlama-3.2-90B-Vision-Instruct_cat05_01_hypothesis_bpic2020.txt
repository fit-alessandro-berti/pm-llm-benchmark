Based on the provided process variants, I've generated a list of 20 questions that could be relevant to improve understanding and identify potential issues. Each question is assigned a confidence score, which represents the likelihood that the question is relevant and useful, based on the provided data. Confidence scores range from 0 (low) to 1 (high).

1. **What is the average time taken for a declaration to be approved by administration?** (Confidence: 0.8)
2. **Which role is most responsible for rejecting declarations?** (Confidence: 0.9)
3. **What is the impact of having a pre-approver on the overall process performance?** (Confidence: 0.7)
4. **Can we identify any bottlenecks in the process by analyzing the frequency and performance of each variant?** (Confidence: 0.9)
5. **How often do declarations get rejected by supervisors, and what is the average time taken for this step?** (Confidence: 0.8)
6. **What is the effect of having multiple rejections on the overall process performance?** (Confidence: 0.85)
7. **Can we optimize the process by removing or streamlining any steps?** (Confidence: 0.8)
8. **Which variant has the highest frequency and performance, and what can we learn from it?** (Confidence: 0.9)
9. **How does the approval by budget owner impact the overall process performance?** (Confidence: 0.7)
10. **Are there any correlations between the number of rejections and the final approval time?** (Confidence: 0.8)
11. **Can we identify any patterns in the rejections by administration?** (Confidence: 0.8)
12. **What is the average time taken for a declaration to be final-approved by a supervisor?** (Confidence: 0.8)
13. **How does the presence of a missing role impact the process performance?** (Confidence: 0.6)
14. **Are there any differences in process performance between declarations submitted by employees and those submitted through other means?** (Confidence: 0.5)
15. **What is the impact of having multiple levels of approval on the overall process performance?** (Confidence: 0.8)
16. **Can we automate any parts of the process to improve efficiency?** (Confidence: 0.7)
17. **How do rejections by pre-approvers impact the overall process performance?** (Confidence: 0.7)
18. **Are there any correlations between the frequency of variants and their performance?** (Confidence: 0.8)
19. **Can we identify any trends in the data that might indicate areas for improvement?** (Confidence: 0.8)
20. **What is the impact of having a saved declaration on the overall process performance?** (Confidence: 0.6)

Please note that these questions are generated based on the provided data and might not cover all aspects of the process. The confidence scores are subjective and may vary based on the specific goals and objectives of the process analysis.
