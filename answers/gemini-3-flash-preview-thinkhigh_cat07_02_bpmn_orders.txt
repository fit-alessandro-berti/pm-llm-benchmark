This image is a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram** illustrating a cross-functional business process involving four departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. It details the flow of activities and information from receiving an order to drafting an invoice.

Here is a description of the process flow by department:

### 1. Sales (Top Lane)
*   **Trigger:** The process begins every **Monday morning** (indicated by a timer start event).
*   **Order Checking Subprocess:** The first step is an expanded subprocess called **"Check customer's order."**
    *   It starts by **Checking order for completeness**.
    *   Next, it **Checks if the customer is already in the database**.
    *   An exclusive gateway (the 'X' diamond) branches the path:
        *   If the customer is NOT in the database, the task **Add customer to the database** is performed (interacting with a database object).
        *   If the customer is already in the database, this step is bypassed.
*   **Communication:** After the order is checked, the Sales department performs the task **Send order details**. This triggers message flows (dashed lines) to both the Production and Procurement lanes.
*   **Wait State:** Sales then waits at a message catch event labeled **"Product sent"** (waiting for confirmation from the Warehouse).
*   **Completion:** Once confirmed, the final task is to **Draft invoice**, and the Sales process ends.

### 2. Production (Second Lane)
*   **Trigger:** Starts when **Order details arrive** via a message from Sales.
*   **Planning:** The process proceeds through a parallel gateway to **Plan production**.
*   **Manufacturing:** After planning, the task **Manufacture product** is performed.
*   **Coordination:** Once the product is finished, a message throw event **"Product complete"** is sent to the Warehouse.
*   **Feedback Loop:** There is an intermediate message catch event for **"Material not faulty"** coming from Procurement, which feeds back into the production cycle.

### 3. Procurement (Third Lane)
*   **Trigger:** Starts when **Order details arrive** via a message from Sales.
*   **Material Compensation Subprocess:** The department enters a subprocess to **Order materials**. This block includes a compensation boundary event linked to a **Return material** task if something goes wrong.
*   **Inspection:** After ordering, the task **Check materials** is performed.
*   **Pathways from Inspection:**
    *   If materials are verified, a message **"Material not faulty"** is sent back to Production.
    *   If an error occurs (indicated by the lightning bolt icon), a compensation event is triggered leading to an **Order cancellation** and the end of the procurement process.

### 4. Warehouse (Bottom Lane)
*   **Trigger:** Starts when a message is received from Production indicating **"Product complete."**
*   **Action:** The Warehouse performs the task **Send product**.
*   **Notification:** Once the product is dispatched, a message throw event **"Product sent"** is triggered, which sends a notification back to the Sales department so they can finalize the invoice.

### Summary of Interactions (Dashed Lines)
*   **Sales to Production/Procurement:** Sends initial order details to start their processes.
*   **Procurement to Production:** Sends notification that materials are ready and not faulty.
*   **Production to Warehouse:** Notifies that the manufacturing is complete.
*   **Warehouse to Sales:** Notifies that the product has been shipped, allowing for the final invoicing.
