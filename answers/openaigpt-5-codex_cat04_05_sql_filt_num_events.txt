**Planning SQL query with CTE count**
</think>
Here's a DuckDB SQL query that selects all events belonging to cases with six or fewer events:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN case_event_counts AS c
  ON e.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE c.event_count <= 6;
```

Explanation:

1. The CTE `case_event_counts` computes number of events per case.
2. We join back to `event_log` to return all events for cases meeting the constraint.
3. The `WHERE` clause filters out cases with more than six events.
