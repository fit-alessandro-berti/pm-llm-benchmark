1. How does the company decide which components should be single-sourced versus dual-/multi-sourced, and what trade-offs (cost, quality, resilience, IP risk) drive those choices?

2. What mechanisms are in place to detect early warning signs of supplier disruption (e.g., geopolitical events, capacity constraints, natural disasters), and how quickly can plans be adapted?

3. How are supplier quality metrics defined and audited across different countries, and how does the company ensure measurement consistency and comparability?

4. In what ways do contractual terms (MOQ, penalties, rebates, incoterms, warranty clauses) shape day-to-day procurement decisions and long-term supplier relationships?

5. How are lead time variability and demand uncertainty incorporated into safety stock policies for different regions and product variants?

6. What are the biggest bottlenecks in the Malaysia assembly plant (equipment, labor, test capacity, yield), and how do they influence product launch schedules?

7. How does the organization balance automation and human labor across shifts while maintaining consistent quality and minimizing operational risk?

8. What is the process for managing engineering changes (ECOs) after design freeze, and how are changes communicated and implemented across suppliers and factories without creating obsolescence?

9. How do quality checks and diagnostic tests determine pass/fail thresholds, and what is the impact of tighter or looser thresholds on yield, warranty rates, and customer satisfaction?

10. What criteria determine when to use air freight versus ocean freight, and how are carbon footprint targets weighed against speed-to-market and cost?

11. How do customs, regulatory compliance, and documentation requirements differ by region, and where do delays most frequently occur in cross-border movement?

12. What strategies are used to mitigate currency and commodity price volatility across this multinational network, and how do those hedging decisions affect pricing and margins?

13. How is the “just-in-time” replenishment model protected from shocks (port congestion, strikes, sudden demand spikes), and what contingency buffers exist?

14. For slower-moving markets using aggregated monthly shipments, how does the company prevent excess inventory and markdowns—especially during model transitions?

15. How are distribution centers optimized (location, capacity, automation, staffing) to balance last-mile speed, inventory holding cost, and service levels?

16. What governance and data standards ensure that purchase orders, invoices, customs declarations, and production schedules remain synchronized across all digital systems?

17. How are machine learning forecasts evaluated over time (bias, drift, accuracy by region/channel), and how does human planner judgment interact with model outputs?

18. When defects emerge in the field, how does the company trace issues back to specific suppliers, batches, or process steps, and how quickly can containment actions be executed?

19. How do environmental and labor compliance requirements influence supplier selection and auditing, and what are the practical challenges of enforcing standards across tiers (tier 2/3)?

20. What continuous improvement initiatives have delivered the largest reductions in lead time, cost, or emissions so far, and what organizational barriers limit scaling those improvements globally?
