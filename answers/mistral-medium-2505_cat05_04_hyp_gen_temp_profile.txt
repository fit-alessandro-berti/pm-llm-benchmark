### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive (R) to Approve (P):**
   - **Anomaly:** The average time (~25 hours) with a very low standard deviation (1 hour) suggests an unusually rigid approval process.
   - **Possible Reason:** This could indicate automated approvals with fixed delays or a bottleneck where approvals are batched at specific times.

2. **Approve (P) to Notify (N):**
   - **Anomaly:** The average delay is 7 days with a high standard deviation (2 days), indicating inconsistent notification timing.
   - **Possible Reason:** This may reflect manual notification processes, backlogs, or delays in customer communication.

3. **Assign (A) to Close (C):**
   - **Anomaly:** Claims are closed quickly (2 hours on average) after assignment, potentially skipping intermediate steps.
   - **Possible Reason:** Some claims may be auto-closed without proper evaluation, or adjusters may prematurely close claims.

4. **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N):**
   - **Anomaly:** The transition is extremely fast (5 minutes on average), which may not align with realistic business processes.
   - **Possible Reason:** This could indicate automated notifications triggered immediately after evaluation or missing intermediate steps.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Rigid Approval Process (R to P):**
   - Approvals may be scheduled in batches rather than processed individually.
   - Some claims may be auto-approved without proper review.

2. **Delayed Notifications (P to N):**
   - Manual notification processes or external dependencies (e.g., postal mail) may cause delays.
   - High workload or resource constraints may lead to inconsistent notification times.

3. **Premature Claim Closures (A to C):**
   - Adjusters may close claims too quickly due to workload pressures or system errors.
   - Some claims may be auto-closed without proper evaluation.

4. **Overly Fast Evaluation-to-Notification (E to N):**
   - Automated systems may trigger notifications immediately after evaluation.
   - Missing intermediate steps (e.g., approval) may cause unrealistic timing.

### SQL Queries for Verification

#### 1. **Identify Claims with Unusually Fast or Slow R-to-P Transitions**
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) -
                        MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS r_to_p_seconds
FROM
    claim_events ce
JOIN
    claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN
    adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE
    ce.activity IN ('R', 'P')
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.name
HAVING
    r_to_p_seconds < 32400 OR r_to_p_seconds > 93600;  -- Outside 9-26 hours
```

#### 2. **Check for Claims with Long P-to-N Delays**
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) -
                        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS p_to_n_seconds
FROM
    claim_events ce
JOIN
    claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN
    adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE
    ce.activity IN ('P', 'N')
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.name
HAVING
    p_to_n_seconds > 604800 + 172800;  -- More than 9 days (avg + 2*STDEV)
```

#### 3. **Find Claims Closed Too Quickly After Assignment (A to C)**
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) -
                        MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS a_to_c_seconds
FROM
    claim_events ce
JOIN
    claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN
    adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE
    ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.name
HAVING
    a_to_c_seconds < 3600;  -- Less than 1 hour (below avg - STDEV)
```

#### 4. **Identify Claims with Unrealistically Fast E-to-N Transitions**
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) -
                        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS e_to_n_seconds
FROM
    claim_events ce
JOIN
    claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN
    adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE
    ce.activity IN ('E', 'N')
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.name
HAVING
    e_to_n_seconds < 300 - 60;  -- Less than 4 minutes (avg - STDEV)
```

#### 5. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjuster or Claim Type**
```sql
SELECT
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) -
                            MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END)))) AS avg_r_to_p_seconds
FROM
    claim_events ce
JOIN
    claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN
    adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE
    ce.activity IN ('R', 'P')
GROUP BY
    a.name, c.claim_type
HAVING
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) -
                            MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END)))) < 32400 OR
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) -
                            MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END)))) > 93600;
```

These queries help identify claims with unusual timing patterns and correlate them with adjusters, claim types, or other factors to uncover potential process inefficiencies or errors.
