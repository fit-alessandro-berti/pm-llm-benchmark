To group the given events into separate cases, we need to look at the attributes that can help us distinguish between different patient journeys. Key attributes to consider are `timestamp`, `activity`, `department`, `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `additional_info`. Here’s how we can group them:

1. **Case 1:**
   - Event 1: `Register patient` for a 45-year-old male with private insurance.
   - Event 4: `Initial triage` for a 45-year-old male.
   - Event 7: `X-ray imaging` for a 45-year-old male.
   - Event 12: `Doctor consultation` for a 45-year-old male with a diagnosis of hairline fracture.
   - Event 15: `Patient discharged` for a 45-year-old male with follow-up instruction to an outpatient clinic.

2. **Case 2:**
   - Event 2: `Register patient` for a 62-year-old female with public insurance.
   - Event 5: `Initial triage` for a 62-year-old female.
   - Event 8: `Lab test requested` for a 62-year-old female.
   - Event 10: `Lab test completed` for a 62-year-old female with normal levels.
   - Event 11: `Doctor consultation` for a 62-year-old female with a diagnosis of minor infection.
   - Event 14: `Prescription created` for a 62-year-old female with antibiotics.
   - Event 17: `Patient discharged` for a 62-year-old female with follow-up instruction to pharmacy pickup.

3. **Case 3:**
   - Event 3: `Register patient` for a 28-year-old male with private insurance.
   - Event 6: `Doctor consultation` for a 28-year-old male with a scheduled knee surgery.
   - Event 9: `Surgery preparation` for a 28-year-old male.
   - Event 13: `Surgery performed` for a 28-year-old male with a procedure of arthroscopy.
   - Event 16: `Recovery room` for a 28-year-old male with a condition of stable.
   - Event 18: `Patient discharged` for a 28-year-old male with follow-up instruction for physiotherapy sessions.
