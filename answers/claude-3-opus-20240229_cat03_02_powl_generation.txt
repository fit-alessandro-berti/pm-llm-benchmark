Here's the Python code that constructs the POWL model for the given complex digital service provisioning process scenario:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the individual activities
SR = Transition(label="Service Request")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Define the partial order for DA and ACI (they can be done concurrently)
po_da_aci = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# Define the loop between BNC and D&R
loop_bnc_dr = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Define the exclusive choice between CD and MD
xor_cd_md = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Define the partial order for QA and SA (they can be done concurrently)
po_qa_sa = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# Define the overall partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, po_da_aci, loop_bnc_dr, xor_cd_md, po_qa_sa, GLA])

# Add the ordering constraints
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
root.order.add_edge(CS, po_da_aci)
root.order.add_edge(po_da_aci, loop_bnc_dr)
root.order.add_edge(loop_bnc_dr, xor_cd_md)
root.order.add_edge(xor_cd_md, po_qa_sa)
root.order.add_edge(po_qa_sa, GLA)
```

This code does the following:

1. It defines all the individual activities as `Transition` objects.

2. It defines a `StrictPartialOrder` for DA and ACI, allowing them to be executed concurrently.

3. It defines the loop between BNC and D&R using an `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP`.

4. It defines the exclusive choice between CD and MD using an `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR`.

5. It defines another `StrictPartialOrder` for QA and SA, allowing them to be executed concurrently.

6. It defines the overall `StrictPartialOrder` that includes all the activities and sub-models.

7. Finally, it adds the ordering constraints using `root.order.add_edge()`. These constraints ensure that:
   - CS can only start after SR is completed.
   - The partial order of DA and ACI can only start after CS is completed.
   - The loop of BNC and D&R can only start after the partial order of DA and ACI is completed.
   - The exclusive choice between CD and MD can only happen after the loop of BNC and D&R ends.
   - The partial order of QA and SA can only start after the choice between CD and MD is made and completed.
   - GLA can only start after the partial order of QA and SA is completed.

This POWL model faithfully represents the described digital service provisioning process scenario.
