Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process and the requirements. The strict rules outline a sequence for processing a loan application: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [Finalize Doc if Approved]  Close Case. There are specific ordering rules, like Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment, and Finalize Documentation can only happen if approved and before closing. Also, skipping steps, reversing order, or finalizing docs after a rejection are not allowed.

Then there are the desiderata: recommendations like completing Credit Check within 24 hours, informing within 48 hours of the decision, and a follow-up call before closing. These are best practices but not strict rules.

Looking at the event logs for cases 1, 2, and 3.

Starting with Case 1: All steps are in order, including Finalize Documentation after approval and closing. The timestamps show Step 1: 9:30 after 09:00 (within 24h), Step 2: 10 hours after 09:30 (which is 11:00, same day). Step 4: Loan Decision. Step 5: Inform Applicant at 13:00, three hours after. The criteria is within 48 hours of loan decision, which is ok. The follow-up call is missing, but that's a desideratum. So Case 1 is good for normative but missing the follow-up.

Case 2: Here, Risk Assessment happens before Credit Check. That's a no-no. Then after rejection, Finalize Documentation is done before closing. Also not allowed. So Case 2 violates both normative rules.

Case 3: Credit Check happens 24 hours after Application Received (Received 09:00, Credit Check at 10:00 same day? Wait, timestamp is 2024-01-14 10:00, which is 24h later. Wait, Application was on 2024-01-12 09:00, so 24h later would be 09:00 on 2024-01-13. Wait, the timestamp for Credit Check is 2024-01-14 10:00. Wait, 14th is two days later. Wait, maybe a miscalculation. Wait, Application received on 2024-01-12 09:00, Credit Check at 10:00 on 2024-01-14. That's 48 hours later, which exceeds the 24h window. Also, Inform Applicant is at 15:00 on 2024-01-16, which is 2 days after the decision. The loan decision was approved on 2024-01-14 12:00, so 48 hours later is 2024-01-16 12:00. The Inform Applicant is at 15:00 same day, which is within 48h but late if we consider 2 days. But the criteria says "within 48 hours of loan decision" so if the decision is at 12:00 on the 14th, 48h is 12:00 on the 16th. So 15:00 is within the window but on the edge. The follow-up call is missing again. So Case 3 misses the desiderata on timing but not normative. Wait, but the Advisor's Note says that deviations to desiderata like timing are not severe. Also, the Credit Check was done 24h after, which is a violation of the normative requirement. Wait, but wait: the normative rule doesn't mention timing as a strict rule. The normative is about the order. The Credit Check in Case 3 is on 2024-01-14, which is 48 hours after Application Received (02/12). The normative rule doesn't specify time windows, only order. The time for Credit Check is a desideratum, not normative. Wait, the problem says "Desiderata" are recommended timing, like Credit Check within 24h. But the Normative is only the order. Wait, looking back: "Identifying Cases That Fail the Normative Rules" No, the normative timing is not enforced. The step to check process time for Credit Check is a desideratum. Wait, the problem states that the mandates are strict with ordering, but the timing is part of desiderata. Wait, the key constraints in Normative Process Behavior specify the sequence but not time windows. The timing is part of the best practices. So in Case 3, the Credit Check happens 48h after Application Received, which violates desideratum but not normative. Similarly, Inform Applicant is at 15:00 on 16th, which is within 48h. Wait, 12:00 (decision) to 15:00 (inform) same day is within 48h. Wait, maybe a miscalculation. From 14th 12:00 to 16th 15:00 is two full days plus 3 hours, which is under 48h (48h is two days). Wait, 14th 12:00 is day 1. Day 2 12:00 is 24+24=48h. So 16th 15:00 is day 2, which is within 48h. Wait, but 14th 12:00 + 48h is 16th 12:00. So 15:00 is within. So Case 3's time violations are to desiderata. So the normative rules are satisfied. So Case 3 has time issues but not normative violations.

Case 2 has two normative violations: wrong order and Finalize after rejection.

Case 1 and 3 have desideratum deviations but not normative. Case 1 had a follow-up call missing. Case 3 same.

So summarizing:

Normative violations: Case 2. Two violations.

Desideratum failures: Case 1 (follow-up call missing), Case 3 (Credit Check 24h late and Inform after 48h might be edge but within, but wait, the Inform Applicant is at 15:00 on 16th, which is within 48h, but the time since decision is from 14th 12:00. So Inform is at 15:00 on 16th. 48h is 48 hours, which is 2 days. So 12:00 on 14th + 48h = 12:00 on 16th. So Inform at 15:00 is within 48h. But the Credit Check was started on 12th, done on 14th. That's 48 hours. The desideratum is "within 24 hours", so 48 is too late. Therefore Case 3's Credit Check is a partial time failure. Inform is ok. Also, the follow-up call isn't there, but that's another absence.

Therefore, the answer should list Case 1 and 3 for desideratum, Case 2 for normative. Also, for Case 2's undesideratum: the Finalize after rejection is bad. The other half is the wrong order and missing Credit Check. So the answer should break it down.

### Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance  

---

#### **1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Sequences and Constraints)**  
Cases **2** and **2** violate the normative standards defined in Part 1. Below is a breakdown:  

| **Case** | **Violation(s)** | **Explanation** |  
|----------|------------------|-----------------|  
| **Case 2 (Subcase 1)** | **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** | The normative sequence requires Credit Check  Risk Assessment. Here, Risk Assessment starts before Credit Check, violating the ordering rule. |  
| **Case 2 (Subcase 2)** | **Finalize Documentation after Rejection** | After a loan rejection, the normative rules explicitly prohibit documenting/finalizing actions. Case 2 performs "Finalize Documentation" before closing, violating the constraint against post-rejection finalization. |  
| **Case 2 (Subcase 3)** | **Missing Critical Steps / Reverses Order** | The case also skips no steps but performs "Risk Assessment" prematurely and then "Finalize Documentation" after rejection, which are both prohibited. |  

**Non-compliant Scenario in Case 2:**  
> `Application Received (2024-01-11 08:00)  Risk Assessment (08:20)  Credit Check (09:00)  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation (10:00)  Close Case (10:30)`  
>  
> **Issue**: Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check (invalid order) and Finalize Documentation happens after a rejection (explicitly forbidden).  

---

#### **2. Desideratum-Only Deviations (Recommended but Not Strict)**  
Cases **1** and **3** fail to meet best practice guidelines (desiderata), but these are non-violations since they are optional recommendations. Below is the analysis:  

| **Case** | **Deviation(s)** | **Impact/Justification** |  
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|  
| **Case 1** | **Missing Follow-up Call** | The process closes without a follow-up call to the applicant. While encouraged for alignment, it is not mandatory. |  
| **Case 3** | **Timing Deviations**:  
  1. Credit Check delayed by 48h (application at 09:00, CC at 10:00 on next day vs. req. 24h).  
  2. Inform Applicant late (decision at 12:00, text at 15:00 next day vs. req. 48h).  
  3. No follow-up call. |  
| **Case 1/3 Discrepancy Explanation** | Timing issues are minor and contextually excusable:  
- Credit Check delays can arise from processing bottlenecks.  
- Inform Applicant timing may align with operational windows (e.g., project-based approvals).  
  **However**, these are suboptimal and violate the spirit of best practices, though not regulatory rules. |  

---

#### **3. Contextual Interpretations and Justifications**  
| **Observation** | **Interpretation** |  
|-----------------|--------------------|  
| **Case 2's Order Reversal** | The program may have flagrantly processed inputs out of sequence without validation. This suggests a systemic flaw in workflow controls, as seen in the missing prior timestamp for Risk Assessment. |  
| **Case 3's Delays** | Applies to Timing: Incentives, staff shortages, or external dependencies (e.g., credit bureaus) could justify delays. Case 3’s 24+ hour Credit Check delay exceeds best practice but does not break rules. |  

---

### **Summary**  
- **Severe Violations**: Case 2 (Order reversal + post-rejection finalization).  
- **Minor Deviations**: Cases 1 and 3 (missing follow-up, timing missteps).  
- **No Critical Failures**: All cases completed due processes, even if suboptimal or non-compliant.  

**Recommendations**:  
1. Deploy rigorous validation to prevent order-sequence errors (e.g., Case 2).  
2. Monitor timing for credit checks and applicant updates (cases 1/3) to align with best practices.  
3. Document conditions justifying delays (e.g., IT outages, third-party dependencies) to prevent future penalties.
