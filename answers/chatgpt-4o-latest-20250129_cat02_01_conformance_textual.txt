### **Analysis of Event Log for Deviations**

The normative process description provides a structured sequence for handling orders based on inventory availability. The main constraints are:  
- **Inventory must be checked before authorization or packaging.**  
- **Payment must be authorized before packaging and shipping.**  
- **Orders should not be shipped if canceled.**  
- **"Close order" should be the final step.**  

Let's analyze each case:

---

### **✅ Case 1 (Correct)**
| Activity Sequence: | Receive → Check Inventory → Authorize Payment → Package → Ship → Close |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
**Analysis:**  
- All activities occur in the correct order.  
- Inventory is checked before authorizing payment.  
- Payment is authorized before packaging.  
- Items are packaged before shipping.  
- The order is closed last.  
✅ **This case follows the normative process correctly.**  

---

### **❌ Case 2 (Incorrect)**  
| Activity Sequence: | Receive → Check Inventory → Package → Authorize Payment → Ship → Close |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
**Violations:**  
1. **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."**  
   - Per the normative process, payment must be authorized before packaging.  
2. **"Authorize payment" occurs after packaging.**  
   - This suggests that items were prepared before confirming the payment, which is not allowed.  

❌ **This case violates the required order of authorization and packaging.**  

---

### **❌ Case 3 (Incorrect)**  
| Activity Sequence: | Receive → Check Inventory → Authorize Payment → Cancel → Ship → Close |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
**Violations:**  
1. **"Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order."**  
   - If an order is going to be canceled, payment should not be authorized.  
2. **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."**  
   - An order that has been canceled should not proceed to shipping.  

❌ **This case violates both the payment authorization rule and the cancellation rule.**  

---

### **✅ Case 4 (Correct - Cancellation Scenario)**  
| Activity Sequence: | Receive → Check Inventory → Cancel → Close |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
**Analysis:**  
- Inventory is checked first.  
- Order is canceled correctly after checking inventory.  
- No unauthorized steps (like payment authorization or shipping) occur after cancellation.  
- "Close order" is the final step.  
✅ **This case follows the expected cancellation sequence.**  

---

### **❌ Case 5 (Incorrect)**  
| Activity Sequence: | Receive → Check Inventory → Authorize Payment → Ship → Close |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
**Violations:**  
1. **"Ship order" occurs without "Package items."**  
   - Items should be packaged before shipping.  

❌ **This case violates the required packaging step before shipping.**  

---

### **Final Verdict**  
| Case ID | Correct? | Violations |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 1       | ✅ Yes  | None |
| 2       | ❌ No  | Packaging before payment authorization |
| 3       | ❌ No  | Payment authorized before cancellation, shipping after cancellation |
| 4       | ✅ Yes  | None |
| 5       | ❌ No  | Shipping without packaging |

### **Conclusion**  
Cases **2, 3, and 5** violate the normative process and do not adhere to the expected flow. Cases **1 and 4** follow the correct process structure.
