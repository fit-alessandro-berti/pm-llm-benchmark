**Explanation and Reasoning:**

1. **Timestamp Conversion:**  The code first converts the timestamp strings to `datetime` objects using `datetime.fromisoformat()`. This allows for accurate time difference calculations.  The `replace('Z', '+00:00')` handles the 'Z' timezone indicator correctly.

2. **Matching Logic:** The core of the merging process is the nested loop. It iterates through each event in Log A and attempts to find a matching event in Log B based on:
   - **Order ID:**  The `order_id` must be identical.
   - **Timestamp Proximity:** The absolute difference between the timestamps must be within the `timestamp_tolerance_seconds` (defaulting to 2 seconds).

3. **Event Merging:** When a match is found:
   - A new dictionary `merged_event` is created.
   - Attributes from both Log A and Log B are included in the merged event.
   - Log A's timestamp is chosen as the primary timestamp for the merged event. This is based on the requirement that Log A is the "primary" timeline.
   - A `source` attribute is added to indicate that the event is a merge of data from both logs.
   - `log_b_matched` list is used to prevent re-matching of Log B events.

4. **Handling Unmatched Events:**
   - If an event in Log A has no match in Log B, it's added to the `merged_log` as-is, with its `source` set to "Log A".
   - After processing Log A, the code iterates through Log B and adds any remaining unmatched events to the `merged_log`, with their `source` set to "Log B".

5. **Naming Variations:** The code handles event name variations by including both `event_type` (from Log A) and `event_name` (from Log B) in the merged event.  This preserves all available information.

6. **Timestamp Differences:** The `timestamp_tolerance_seconds` parameter allows for slight discrepancies in timestamps between the two logs.  The default value of 2 seconds is used, but this can be adjusted based on the expected level of synchronization between the systems.

7. **Chronological Order:** The `merged_log.sort(key=lambda x: x['timestamp'])` line sorts the final merged log by the primary timestamp (Log A's timestamp), ensuring chronological order.

8. **Attribute Handling:** The code uses `event_b.get('user_id')` to safely access attributes from Log B that might not be present in all events. This prevents errors if an event in Log B is missing a particular attribute.

This solution provides a robust and flexible approach to merging the two event logs, addressing the requirements of matching, merging, handling missing events, and maintaining chronological order.  The reasoning behind each decision is documented in the code and explanation.
