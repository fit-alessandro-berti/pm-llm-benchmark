### **Step 1: Identify Recurring Activities and Their Contextual Differences**

From the event log, the activities that recur within the same case and have different meanings based on context are:

---

#### **1. `Verify Documents`**
- **First occurrence (C001, C002, C003):** Initial document verification attempt.
- **Second occurrence (C001, C003):** Re-verification after additional information or corrections.

#### **2. `Call Customer`**
- **First occurrence (C001, C002, C003):** Initial contact to resolve issues or request missing info.
- **Second occurrence (C002):** Follow-up call to confirm resolution.

#### **3. `Adjust Account`**
- **C002:** Internal adjustment after first call.
- **C003:** Internal adjustment after document verification.

(Note: `Adjust Account` only appears once per case, but its context varies. It can still be renamed for clarity.)

### **Step 4: Naming Justifications**

- **`Initial Document Verification`:** Used for the first instance of document checking to indicate the start of the verification process.
- **`Re-Verify Documents After Update`:** Clearly reflects that this is a second verification following a document update or internal adjustment.
- **`Initial Customer Call`:** Identifies the first customer interaction to resolve an issue or request additional info.
- **`Follow-up Customer Call`:** Used for a second interaction to confirm that prior actions were effective or complete.
- **`Internal Account Adjustment`:** Renamed to emphasize that this is a backend system correction, not visible to the customer.

This renaming approach ensures that the activity names are semantically distinct, aiding process analysis, modeling, and automation.
