Based on the interview transcripts provided, I'll generate a BPMN-like textual process model for the invoice approval process:

Process: Invoice Approval

Start Event: Invoice Received (typically via email)

Activities:
1. Check for Valid PO Number (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - If no PO: Send back to supplier requesting more details
   - If PO present: Proceed to next step

2. Log Invoice in Accounting System (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)

3. Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)

4. Check Invoice Against PO (Role: Purchasing Officer)
   - If discrepancy found: Contact supplier or notify Accounts Payable to hold invoice
   - If correct: Send confirmation to Accounts Payable

5. Match Invoice Line Items to PO (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - If match: Proceed to next step
   - If discrepancy: Email Purchasing team for clarification

6. Request Manager Approval (Role: System - automatic email)

7. Review and Approve Invoice (Role: Department Manager)
   - If approved: Proceed to next step
   - If rejected or suspicious: Hold and investigate further

8. Schedule for Payment (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)

End Event: Invoice Approved for Payment

Gateways/Decision Points:
1. Is there a valid PO number? (After Step 1)
2. Does invoice match PO? (After Step 4)
3. Do invoice line items match PO? (After Step 5)
4. Manager approval decision (After Step 7)

Exceptions/Variations:
1. Missing PO Number: 
   - Accounts Payable sends back to supplier
   - Supplier Relationship Manager may be involved to obtain PO or revised invoice

2. Invoice Discrepancies:
   - If not easily resolved, escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor
   - Accounts Payable Supervisor attempts to resolve with supplier or coordinates between departments

3. Invoices Without PO:
   - Escalated to Accounts Payable Supervisor
   - May work with department heads to create retrospective PO or reject invoice

4. Pricing Discrepancies:
   - Supplier Relationship Manager may be involved to check contract terms and confirm correct pricing

5. Manager Rejection:
   - Invoice held for further investigation
   - May loop back to earlier steps for clarification or correction

Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:
1. Invoice (Input)
2. Purchase Order (Reference Document)
3. Goods Receipt Confirmation (Input from Purchasing)
4. System Notifications/Emails (For approvals and clarifications)

Notes:
- The process typically flows linearly but can loop back at various points if discrepancies or issues are found.
- Multiple roles are involved, with key handoffs between Accounts Payable, Purchasing, and Department Managers.
- The system plays a role in logging invoices and triggering approval requests.
- Exception handling, particularly for discrepancies or missing information, can involve additional roles like the Accounts Payable Supervisor or Supplier Relationship Manager.

This textual representation captures the main flow, decision points, roles, and exceptions described in the interviews, providing a basis for creating a detailed BPMN diagram.
