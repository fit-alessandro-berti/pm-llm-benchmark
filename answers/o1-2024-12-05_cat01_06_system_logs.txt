**Explanation of Case and Activity Grouping:**

In this transformed event log, each "case" represents a coherent unit of work focused on a particular artifact (e.g., a specific Word document, an email thread, a PDF, or a spreadsheet). The logic for case identification is as follows:

- **Word Documents (Document1.docx, Quarterly_Report.docx)**:  
  Each case corresponds to editing sessions tied to a single document. For example, all events related to "Document1.docx" from when it is first opened (focus gained) until it is finally closed are grouped into one case. Intermediate switching to other applications does not end the case, as long as the user returns to the same document and eventually closes it.

- **Email (Annual Meeting Email)**:  
  Events related to handling a specific email chain (opening the inbox, opening the email, reviewing its content, composing and sending a reply) form a single email-handling case.

- **PDF Review (Report_Draft.pdf)**:  
  Viewing, scrolling, and highlighting a PDF document is considered a single case that starts with opening the PDF and ends when the user switches to another application.

- **Spreadsheet Editing (Budget_2024.xlsx)**:  
  Similarly, focusing on the spreadsheet, editing values, and saving the file constitutes one case. The case ends when the user leaves the spreadsheet for another context.

**Activity Naming:**
Low-level actions (e.g., "TYPING," "SCROLL," "FOCUS") have been translated into higher-level process activities. For example, "TYPING" within a Word document becomes "Edit Document," and "SAVE" becomes "Save Document." Actions in the email application (CLICK, SCROLL, TYPING) are combined into activities like "Open Email," "Review Email Content," "Reply to Email," and "Send Email," presenting a more business-oriented view of the userâ€™s activities.

This approach provides a cleaner and more interpretable event log for process mining tools, focusing on meaningful units of user work rather than raw system-level interactions.
