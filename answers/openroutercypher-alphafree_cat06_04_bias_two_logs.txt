The two event logs provided show clear evidence of bias. 

**Log exhibiting bias: Group B (Unprotected Group)**

**How the bias manifests:**

1. **Community Boost Score Adjustment:** 
   - In Group B, certain applicants receive a "Community Boost" adjustment, which increases their preliminary scores. This does not occur in Group A.
   - CaseID U001 and U003 from Group B receive a +10 score boost merely for being members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club," which directly influences their preliminary scores and, consequently, the outcome of their applications.

2. **Influence of LocalResident Attribute:**
   - All applicants in Group B are marked as local residents (TRUE), whereas applicants in Group A are marked as non-local residents - The generated text has been blocked by our content filters.
