Merged Event Log for Order #1234  
(primary _ts = timestamp that will be used for ordering; we keep the partner_ts from the other log when a match exists)

| # | primary_ts | partner_ts | unified_event_name | order_id | origin | user_id | resource_id | notes | comment on merge |
|---|------------|-----------|--------------------|----------|--------|---------|-------------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | 2023-10-10 10:00:00 Z | 2023-10-10 09:59:58 Z | Order Received | Order#1234 | A & B | u45 | r10 | “Event captured at warehouse system” | Names “Order Received” (A) and “OrderReceived” (B) are obvious synonyms and the timestamps differ by only 2 s  merged. |
| 2 | 2023-10-10 10:01:30 Z | 2023-10-10 10:01:29 Z | Order Validated | Order#1234 | A & B | u12 | r10 | “Cross-check inventory” | “Order Validated” vs. “OrderValidation”; t = 1 s  merged. |
| 3 | 2023-10-10 10:02:00 Z | 2023-10-10 10:02:05 Z | Payment Processed | Order#1234 | A & B | u12 | r99 | “Payment gateway delay” | “Payment Processed” vs. “PaymentCheck”; t = 5 s (slightly >2 s) but same order, same actor, clearly the same phase; accepted and kept both timestamps. |
| 4 | 2023-10-10 10:03:00 Z | – | Quality Check | Order#1234 | B only | u45 | r11 | “Random inspection” | No counterpart in A  kept as-is with B timestamp, origin = B. |
| 5 | 2023-10-10 10:05:00 Z | 2023-10-10 10:05:02 Z | Item Shipped | Order#1234 | A & B | u45 | r10 | “Package handed to courier” | “Item Shipped” vs. “Shipping”; t = 2 s  merged. |
| 6 | 2023-10-10 10:20:00 Z | – | Item Delivered | Order#1234 | A only | – | – | – | No entry in B; kept from A. |

Chronological list (ordered by primary_ts)
1. 2023-10-10 10:00:00 Z – Order Received  
2. 2023-10-10 10:01:30 Z – Order Validated  
3. 2023-10-10 10:02:00 Z – Payment Processed  
4. 2023-10-10 10:03:00 Z – Quality Check  
5. 2023-10-10 10:05:00 Z – Item Shipped  
6. 2023-10-10 10:20:00 Z – Item Delivered  

How the matching was done:

1. Key fields used: order_id (exact match) + timestamp proximity ( 2 s preferred, but extended to 5 s when semantics are unambiguous) + semantic mapping of event names.  
   Mapping dictionary built during inspection:  
   • Order Received  OrderReceived  
   • Order Validated  OrderValidation  
   • Payment Processed  PaymentCheck  
   • Item Shipped  Shipping  

2. For every event in Log A we searched Log B for the first record that  
   • has the same order_id,  
   • whose event_name maps to the same business activity, and  
   • whose timestamp lies within the tolerance window.  
   If found, records were merged; otherwise the A-record stayed unpaired.  

3. Attributes retained:  
   • All columns from both logs.  
   • When both logs supply a timestamp we keep both, designate one (from A) as primary to preserve the original order of the “authoritative” system, but expose partner_ts so that the raw data are not lost.  

4. Events existing in only one log (“Quality Check”, “Item Delivered”) were inserted unchanged, with an “origin” flag indicating which system they came from.

Result: a single enriched event log that preserves the full set of attributes, resolves naming differences, documents timestamp discrepancies, and keeps every original event—either merged or standalone.
