**Analysis of Case Resolution Times and Performance Factors**

---

### 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

Let's calculate the total resolution time for each case, from **Receive Ticket** to **Close Ticket**:

| Case ID | Receive Time       | Close Time         | Total Duration                  |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00   | 2024-03-01 10:15   | 2 hrs 15 min                   |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05   | 2024-03-02 09:15   | ~25 hrs 10 min                 |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10   | 2024-03-01 09:30   | 1 hr 20 min                   |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20   | 2024-03-02 08:30   | ~24 hrs 10 min                 |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25   | 2024-03-03 09:30   | ~49 hrs 5 min                  |

**Significantly Longer Cases:**  
- Case 105 (~49 hrs)  
- Case 102 (~25 hrs)  
- Case 104 (~24 hrs)

These three cases take roughly an order of magnitude longer than the shortest cases (103 and 101).

### 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

Analyzing the timeline and activities, key factors emerge:

#### a) Presence of Escalations
- Cases 102 and 105 include escalation to Level-2 Agent.  
- Case 105 escalates even later during investigation, which implies repeated reassignment or unresolved complexity.  
- Case 104 **did not escalate** but still took long — suggests other causes exist.

#### b) Long Waiting Times Between Activities
- **Case 102:** After escalation at 11:30, investigation only starts at 14:00 (2.5 hr gap). Then resolution is only next day at 09:00 (approx. 19 hr gap).  
- **Case 104:** Very long delay between “Assign to Level-1 Agent” (09:30) and “Investigate Issue” (13:00) same day (3.5 hr), then large overnight gap from investigation (13:00) to resolution next day 08:00 (about 19 hr).  
- **Case 105:** Long idle gaps—after escalating at 10:00 on Day 1, investigation only resumes at 14:00 Day 2 (~28 hr wait), resolution on Day 3 (~19 hr after investigation start).

#### c) Delays Before Investigation and Resolution
- Assign to agent to investigation is sometimes delayed significantly (especially Cases 104 and 105).  
- Delays after escalation before investigation/resolution start indicate bottlenecks in the escalation or Level-2 agent availability.

### 3. How These Factors Lead to Increased Cycle Times & Recommendations

#### Why These Factors Lead to Delays
- **Escalation Overhead:** Escalation adds coordination overhead. If Level-2 agents have limited availability or there’s inefficient handoff, tickets wait longer before investigation resumes.  
- **Idle Waiting Periods:** Large waiting times indicate possible resource constraints or process inefficiencies (e.g., delayed triage, agent overload, or poor scheduling).  
- **Late Investigation Starts:** Delayed investigation postpones resolution, extending ticket lifetime drastically.  
- **Overnight Waiting:** Tickets paused overnight may indicate that work is stuck waiting for next workday, worsening resolution time.

#### Recommendations to Reduce Cycle Times
1. **Improve Escalation Workflow:**
   - Streamline Level-2 agent workload and response times.  
   - Automate or expedite handoff notifications and acknowledgments to minimize waiting.  
2. **Resource Pool Optimization:**
   - Balance workload to avoid agent bottlenecks, especially for investigation tasks.  
   - Possibly allocate dedicated agents or shifts to cover escalations and investigations promptly.  
3. **Monitor and Limit Idle Times:**
   - Set maximum thresholds for waiting periods between steps.  
   - Escalate internally if thresholds exceeded to avoid excessive delays.  
4. **Enable After-Hours Support or Faster Handoffs:**
   - Overnight pauses suggest work pending start of next day. Consider shift adjustments or asynchronous work handoffs to reduce downtime.  
5. **Process Automation & Transparency:**
   - Use a ticketing system dashboard to highlight aging tickets and flag those exceeding defined service levels, especially for escalations.  
   - Automate reminders to reduce human-induced delays.

### Summary

| Finding                       | Cases Affected     | Impact                    | Suggested Action                         |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Escalations to Level-2 agent   | 102, 105           | Longer waits post-escalation | Streamline Level-2 workflow, increase agent availability |
| Long idle gaps between activities | 102, 104, 105    | Extended cycle time       | Monitor waiting times, enforce SLAs between steps |
| Overnight waiting periods       | 102, 104, 105      | Unproductive waiting      | Adjust schedules, enable after-hours support |
| Delayed investigation starts   | 104, 105           | Delays in issue resolution | Prioritize investigations, improve scheduling |

By addressing these root causes, performance bottlenecks can be reduced, enabling faster ticket resolution and improved customer satisfaction.
