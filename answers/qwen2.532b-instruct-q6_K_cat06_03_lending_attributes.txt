In the context of process mining and event logs, certain attributes can be considered sensitive in terms of evaluating fairness. Sensitive attributes are those that might introduce bias or unfair treatment if they influence the outcomes or performance of activities within a process.

From the provided information, here's an analysis of which attributes could potentially be sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute divides cases into "True" (citizens) and "False" (non-citizens). If the process treats non-citizens differently from citizens, this would be a concern for fairness.

2. **case:gender**: The distinction between genders could indicate potential gender biases in how the process is conducted or outcomes are decided. For instance, if there's differential treatment based on gender, it violates principles of fairness.

3. **case:german speaking**: Similar to citizenship and gender, this attribute suggests a division that might lead to preferential treatment or discrimination against those who do not speak German. This could impact the fairness of how services are provided.

These attributes represent characteristics that should ideally be unrelated to how processes such as credit applications and loan agreements are handled. However, if these attributes show significant differences in outcomes (e.g., approval rates, performance times) between different categories within each attribute, it would suggest potential biases or unfair practices.

### How To Evaluate Fairness
To evaluate fairness using these sensitive attributes:
- **Compare Outcomes**: Look at the frequency and performance of key activities across different groups defined by these attributes. For example, compare loan approvals for citizens vs. non-citizens.
- **Analyze Trends Over Time**: Check if there are trends over time that suggest worsening or improving fairness based on these attributes.
- **Use Metrics**: Implement metrics such as disparate impact analysis to quantify the extent of any potential bias.

By focusing on these sensitive attributes, you can start to understand and address fairness issues within the process described by your event log.
