Here’s a concise walkthrough of the visualization:

a) Two procleT classes connected through two channels
- Depicts a workflow between “Lab visit” (left lane) and “Lab test” (right lane), coordinated via two communication channels: Order system (top dashed box) and HIS (middle dashed box).
- Lab visit lane (roles: doctor, lab assistant):
  1. Order entry  Take blood sample.
  2. Send an order via the Order system to the Lab test class.
  3. Receive result via HIS  Judge results.
  4. If results are fine, Send report; otherwise Do tests again and Receive updated result, then Send report.
- Lab test lane (roles: chemical analyst):
  1. Perform test  Make report  send result via HIS.
  2. If requested again, Perform test again  Provide updated report  send updated result via HIS.
- Start and end events are shown for both classes, with message flows connecting corresponding steps through the channels.

b) Class diagram
- Shows two procleT classes: Lab visit and Lab test.
- Relationship: Lab visit requires Lab test with multiplicities 1..1 (one Lab visit) requires 1..* (one or more Lab tests).

c) Example of a performative (message log entry)
- Time: 11:00
- Channel: Order system
- Sender: Lab visit – John
- Receivers: Lab test – HGB John
- Action: Create
- Content: “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”
- Scope: Private
- Direction: OUT

Overall, the figure models coordination between clinical workflow (patient visit) and laboratory processing using explicit communication channels and message semantics.
