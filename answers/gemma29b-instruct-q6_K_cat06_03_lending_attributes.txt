The following attributes in your event log could be sensitive for fairness, as they are often protected characteristics and could lead to biased outcomes if not carefully considered during process analysis:

* **case:citizen:** This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen.  Discrimination based on citizenship status is illegal and unethical.
* **case:gender:** This attribute represents the gender of the applicant. Gender bias is a known issue in many domains, and it's crucial to ensure fairness across genders.
* **case:german speaking:** This attribute indicates whether the applicant speaks German. Discrimination based on language can create barriers and unfair treatment.


It's important to remember that even seemingly benign attributes can sometimes be proxies for sensitive information or contribute to unintended bias.
