Certainly! Here are 20 relevant questions about the process, along with a confidence score for each. The confidence score is on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low confidence and 5 indicates high confidence.

1. **What is the most common variant of the declaration process?**
   - Confidence: 5
   - Rationale: This can be determined by looking at the frequency of each variant, which is provided in the data.

2. **Which variant has the highest performance time (in seconds)?**
   - Confidence: 5
   - Rationale: The performance times are given for each variant, so this can be directly identified.

3. **What is the average performance time across all variants?**
   - Confidence: 4
   - Rationale: This requires calculating the weighted average of the performance times based on their frequencies.

4. **How many variants involve a rejection by the Administration?**
   - Confidence: 5
   - Rationale: By counting the number of variants that include "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION," this can be determined.

5. **What is the most frequent variant involving a rejection by the Supervisor?**
   - Confidence: 4
   - Rationale: This requires identifying all variants with "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR" and comparing their frequencies.

6. **How many variants involve multiple rejections before final approval?**
   - Confidence: 5
   - Rationale: By counting the number of variants that include multiple rejection steps, this can be determined.

7. **What is the average frequency of all variants involving a Pre-Approver?**
   - Confidence: 4
   - Rationale: This requires identifying all variants with "Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" and calculating the average of their frequencies.

8. **Which variant has the lowest performance time (in seconds)?**
   - Confidence: 5
   - Rationale: The performance times are given for each variant, so this can be directly identified.

9. **How many variants involve a BUDGET OWNER in the approval process?**
   - Confidence: 5
   - Rationale: By counting the number of variants that include "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER," this can be determined.

10. **What is the total frequency of all variants involving a rejection by the Employee?**
    - Confidence: 4
    - Rationale: This requires summing the frequencies of all variants that include "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE."

11. **Which variant has the highest frequency but not the highest performance time?**
    - Confidence: 4
    - Rationale: By comparing the frequencies and performance times, this can be identified.

12. **How many variants involve a final approval without any rejections?**
    - Confidence: 5
    - Rationale: By counting the number of variants that do not include any rejection steps, this can be determined.

13. **What is the average frequency of all variants involving multiple approvals (e.g., both Administration and Budget Owner)?**
    - Confidence: 4
    - Rationale: This requires identifying all variants with multiple approval steps and calculating the average of their frequencies.

14. **Which variant has the highest performance time among those that are not the most frequent?**
    - Confidence: 4
    - Rationale: By excluding the most frequent variant, this can be identified by comparing the performance times of the remaining variants.

15. **How many variants involve a rejection by the Pre-Approver?**
    - Confidence: 5
    - Rationale: By counting the number of variants that include "Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER," this can be determined.

16. **What is the total performance time for all variants involving a final approval by the Supervisor?**
    - Confidence: 4
    - Rationale: This requires summing the performance times of all variants that include "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR."

17. **Which variant has the lowest frequency but not the lowest performance time?**
    - Confidence: 4
    - Rationale: By comparing the frequencies and performance times, this can be identified.

18. **How many variants involve a rejection by the Administration followed by a final approval?**
    - Confidence: 5
    - Rationale: By counting the number of variants that include "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" followed by "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR," this can be determined.

19. **What is the average performance time for all variants involving a rejection by the Supervisor?**
    - Confidence: 4
    - Rationale: This requires identifying all variants with "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR" and calculating the average of their performance times.

20. **How many variants involve a declaration being saved but not submitted?**
    - Confidence: 5
    - Rationale: By counting the number of variants that include "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE," this can be determined.

These questions cover various aspects of the process, including frequency, performance time, and specific steps in the approval and rejection flows.
