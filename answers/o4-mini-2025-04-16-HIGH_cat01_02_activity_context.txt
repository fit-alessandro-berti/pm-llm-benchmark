2. Justification of Renamings

- “Initiate Request”  “Online Request Submission” / “Branch Walk-In Request Submission”  
  • Distinguishes channel (web vs. in-branch).  
- “Verify Documents” (first occurrence)  “Initial Online ID Verification” / “Initial In-Branch Document Verification”  
  • Marks the first identity check and its channel.  
- “Verify Documents” (second occurrence)  “Re-Verification of Uploaded ID” / “Re-Verification of Documents Post-Adjustment”  
  • Clarifies that this is a follow-up check after the customer’s upload or after internal fixes.  
- “Call Customer” events  context-specific names:  
  • “Outbound Call: Request Missing Documents” (C001) – call to chase missing ID.  
  • “Outbound Call: Clarify Account Discrepancy” (C002, first) – call about an account mismatch.  
  • “Outbound Call: Confirm Account Adjustment” (C002, second) – call to validate completed correction.  
  • “Branch Call: Prompt Customer to Return” (C003) – in-branch call when customer steps away.  
- “Adjust Account”  “Internal Account Adjustment”  
  • Emphasizes that this is a back-office/system update, not a customer-facing step.  
- “Approve Request”  “Supervisor Approval”  
  • Makes explicit the role performing the final sign-off.  

These new names make each activity’s purpose, timing and channel immediately clear and remove ambiguity where the same generic label was being reused.
