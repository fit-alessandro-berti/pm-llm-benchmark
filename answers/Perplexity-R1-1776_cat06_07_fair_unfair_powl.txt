Okay, I need to create two POWL models based on the given hiring process description. Let me start by understanding the requirements. 

The first model should have potential unfairness due to an XOR branch in the cultural fit evaluation. The second model should remove that XOR and ensure all applicants go through the same cultural check. Both models need to include loops for data completeness and follow the sequence of steps described.

For the first model (with unfairness), after the skill assessment, there's an XOR between a standard cultural fit check and a community affiliation check that gives an advantage. So, I need to represent this XOR branch correctly. The loop for data completeness is in the initial step where missing info triggers a request for more details.

Let me outline the steps:

1. ReceiveApplication: This is the starting point.
2. ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck: This would involve a loop. If data is missing, go to RequestMoreInfo and loop back; else proceed.
3. PreliminarySkillAssessment: After resume check, do the skill test.
4. XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck: Here's where bias is introduced. Depending on some condition (like club membership or local residency), one path is taken over the other.
5. ManagerialReview and FinalDecision: After the cultural check, they proceed to managerial review and then final decision.

Wait, but in the description, after skill assessment comes the cultural fit/community check. So the structure would be sequential up to that point.

So for Model 1:

- Start with ReceiveApplication.
- Then a partial order that includes ResumeParsing (which has a loop) leading to SkillAssessment.
- Then an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.
- Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision in sequence.

But how to structure the loop in ResumeParsing? The resume parsing step checks if data is complete. If not, it loops back to request more info. So that's a loop between ResumeParsing (A) and RequestMoreInfo (B). So loop = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [ResumeParsing, RequestMoreInfo]).

Wait, but according to the example given in the problem statement, a loop between A and B means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So in this case, ResumeParsing is A, if data is missing, then RequestMoreInfo (B) is executed, then back to A.

So for Resume parsing step:

Loop = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [ResumeParsingActivity, RequestMoreInfoActivity])

Then after the loop comes SkillAssessment.

Then XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But need to structure this as partial orders.

So for Model 1:

The main nodes would be:

1. ReceiveApplication (Transition)
2. DataCompletenessLoop (the loop for resume parsing)
3. SkillAssessment (Transition)
4. XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck
5. ManagerialReview (Transition)
6. FinalDecision (Transition)

The process is sequential except for the XOR after SkillAssessment.

So structuring as StrictPartialOrder nodes with edges enforcing sequence.

Wait, but POWL allows partial orders with sequences via edges. So ReceiveApplication must come first, then DataCompletenessLoop (the resume parsing loop), then SkillAssessment, then XOR branch, then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision in sequence.

But how to represent this as partial orders?

Each step is a node in a partial order with edges enforcing the sequence.

So root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApp, DataLoop, SkillAssess, XORBranch, ManagerReview, FinalDecide])

Then add edges:

ReceiveApp -> DataLoop

DataLoop -> SkillAssess

SkillAssess -> XORBranch

XORBranch -> ManagerReview

ManagerReview -> FinalDecide

But also need to define what each node is. For example, DataLoop is a Loop operator between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo.

Similarly, XORBranch is an OperatorPOWL with XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Wait let me break it down step by step.

First model (with unfairness):

Activities:

- ReceiveApplication: Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

- ResumeParsing: Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")

- RequestMoreInfo: Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

- SkillAssessment: Transition(label="PreliminarySkillAssessment")

- CulturalFitCheck: Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

- CommunityAffiliationCheck: Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

- ManagerialReview: Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

- FinalDecision: Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Now, DataCompletenessLoop is a Loop between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo:

DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ResumeParsing, RequestMoreInfo])

Then after DataLoop comes SkillAssessment.

Then an XOR branch between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck:

XORBranch = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision in sequence.

So putting it all together as a StrictPartialOrder:

The root would be a StrictPartialOrder with nodes [ReceiveAppNode, DataLoopNode, SkillAssessNode, XORBranchNode, ManagerReviewNode, FinalDecideNode]

Edges:

ReceiveAppNode --> DataLoopNode

DataLoopNode --> SkillAssessNode

SkillAssessNode --> XORBranchNode

XORBranchNode --> ManagerReviewNode

ManagerReviewNode --> FinalDecideNode

But each of these nodes are transitions or operator POWLs.

Wait no: ReceiveApplication is a transition that starts the process. Then comes DataLoop (the loop operator). Then SkillAssessment transition. Then XORBranch operator. Then ManagerialReview transition. Then FinalDecision transition.

So building this as a partial order where each step must be executed in order.

So root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApp, DataLoop, SkillAssess, XORBranch, ManagerReview, FinalDecide])

root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApp, DataLoop)

root.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssess)

root.order.add_edge(SkillAssess, XORBranch)

root.order.add_edge(XORBranch, ManagerReview)

root.order.add_edge(ManagerReview, FinalDecide)

This would enforce the sequence from ReceiveApp all the way through to FinalDecide.

Now for Model 2 (without unfairness), we need to remove the XOR branch and have all applicants go through CulturalFitCheck only.

So instead of an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, there's just CulturalFitCheck for everyone.

Thus, after SkillAssessment comes CulturalFitCheck as a single activity.

So steps would be:

Same as Model 1 but replacing XORBranch with just CulturalFitCheck transition.

Thus:

root nodes would be [ReceiveApp, DataLoop, SkillAssess, CulturalFitCheckNode, ManagerReviewNode, FinalDecideNode]

Edges connecting them sequentially.

No CommunityAffiliationCheck activity here.

Therefore Model 2's POWL structure removes the XOR branch and has everyone go through CulturalFitCheck directly after SkillAssessment.

Now translating this into code using POWL constructs as per the example provided earlier.

Let me code each model step by step.

For Model 1 with potential unfairness:

First define all transitions:

ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

ResumeParsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")

RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

SkillAssessment = Transition(label="PreliminarySkillAssessment")

CulturalFit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

CommunityAffiliation = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Then create DataCompletenessLoop as LOOP between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo:

DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ResumeParsing, RequestMoreInfo])

Then create XOR branch after SkillAssessment:

XORBranch = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFit, CommunityAffiliation])

Now construct the main partial order:

root_model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication,

                                       DataLoop,

                                       SkillAssessment,

                                       XORBranch,

                                       ManagerialReview,

                                       FinalDecision])

Add edges in sequence:

root_model1.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)

root_model1.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)

root_model1.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment,XORBranch)

root_model1.order.add_edge(XORBranch, ManagerialReview)

root_model1.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview,FinalDecision)

That's Model 1.

For Model 2 without unfairness:

Same steps except no CommunityAffiliation activity or XOR branch; everyone goes through CulturalFitCheck after SkillAssessment.

Thus transitions are same except no CommunityAffiliation activity used here.

So steps are:

ReceiveApplication -> DataLoop -> SkillAssessment -> CulturalFit -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

Thus root_model2 is StrictPartialOrder with nodes [ReceiveApplication,

                                                DataLoop,

                                                SkillAssessment,

                                                CulturalFit,

                                                ManagerialReview,

                                                FinalDecision]

Edges added sequentially as before:

root_model2.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication,

                           DataLoop)

root_model2.order.add_edge(DataLoop,

                           SkillAssessment)

root_model2.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment,

                           CulturalFit)

root_model2.order.add_edge(CulturalFit,

                           ManagerialReview)

root_model2.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview,

                           FinalDecision)

So that's Model 2 without any branching into CommunityAffiliation check; everyone follows same path after skill assessment.

I need to make sure that in Model 1 there's an explicit XOR branch where either cultural fit or community affiliation check happens (but not both), whereas in Model 2 it's just cultural fit check for all.

**POWL Models**

**1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import Transition

# Define Activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck = Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="PreliminarySkillAssessment")
CulturalFitEvaluation = Transition(label="CulturalFitEvaluation")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationEvaluation")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for Resume Parsing
DataCompletenessLoop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck,
              RequestMoreInfo]
)

# Unfair Branch (XOR)
UnfairXORBranch = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[CulturalFitEvaluation,
              CommunityAffiliationCheck]
)

# Main Workflow Structure
model_with_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[ReceiveApplication,
           DataCompletenessLoop,
           SkillAssessment,
           UnfairXORBranch,
           ManagerialReview,
           FinalDecision]
)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication,
                                    DataCompletenessLoop)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessLoop,
                                    SkillAssessment)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment,
                                    UnfairXORBranch)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(UnfairXORBranch,
                                    ManagerialReview)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview,
                                    FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**  
The workflow introduces bias via an **XOR** gate after skill assessment:
- Applicants either undergo `CulturalFitEvaluation` *or* `CommunityAffiliationEvaluation`.
- The latter branch implicitly favors candidates with local affiliations (`Global Business Leaders Club` members/local residents).

---

**2. POWL Model Without Unfairness:**

```python
# Same activities except no CommunityAffiliationEvaluation
CulturalFitEvaluationAll = Transition(label="CulturalFitEvaluationAllCandidates")

# Loop remains identical
FairProcessSequence = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[ReceiveApplication,
           DataCompletenessLoop,
           SkillAssessment,
           CulturalFitEvaluationAll,
           ManagerialReview,
           FinalDecision]
)
FairProcessSequence.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication,
                                  DataCompletenessLoop)
FairProcessSequence.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessLoop,
                                  SkillAssessment)
FairProcessSequence.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment,
                                  CulturalFitEvaluationAll)
FairProcessSequence.order.add_edge(CulturalFitEvaluationAll,
                                  ManagerialReview)
FairProcessSequence.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview,
                                  FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**  
Bias is eliminated by:
- Removing **XOR branching**; all applicants follow a single path.
- Replacing `CommunityAffiliationEvaluation` with uniform `CulturalFitEvaluationAllCandidates`.
- No special treatment based on affiliations/residency; evaluations are standardized post-skill assessment.
