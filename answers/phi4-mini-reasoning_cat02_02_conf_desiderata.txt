Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand both parts of the question: identifying violations of normative rules (strict rules) and checking desiderata (recommended practices). Let's start with each case provided.

**Case 1:**  
Looking at Case 1's timeline:

- Application Received at 09:00.
- Then Credit Check at 09:30. That's fine, sequence followed.
- Risk Assessment next at 10:00. Still in order.
- Loan Decision (Approved) at 11:00. Correct after risk assessment.
- Inform Applicant at 13:00. After decision, okay.
- Finalize Documentation at 13:30. Since approved, this is allowed before closing.
- Close Case at 14:00. All steps followed properly here.

So no issues with Case 1. It adheres strictly to the sequence and doesn't skip any steps or do anything contradictory.

**Case 2:**  
Now, Case 2:

- Application Received on 2024-01-11 08:00.
- Then Risk Assessment at 08:20. Wait, that's immediately after receiving the application. But according to normative rules, Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Here, they did Risk Assessment first without a prior credit check. That's a clear violation of the sequence rule. The entry says "(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)" which is correct.

- Then at 09:00, Credit Check is done. But since risk assessment already happened earlier (08:20) before the credit check, that's another violation. So first error here is out-of-sequence Risk Assessment without Credit Check.

Next steps: Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30. After risk assessment and prior activities. Now, upon rejection, per normative rules, finalizing documentation isn't allowed. But in this case, they did Finalize Documentation after the decision. That's a second violation. So two issues here: incorrect sequence (Risk before Credit), and doing finalize post-rejection.

Then Close Case at 10:30. Even though they closed without following approval steps, but since it's rejected, that's correct per rules. However, they had prior violations in process.

**Case 3:**  
Case 3:

- Application Received on 09:00.
- Then Credit Check happens on 2024-01-14 at 10:00. That's 13 days and 10 hours later? Wait, from January 12 to January 14 is two days. From midnight on Jan 12 to midnight on Jan 14 is 48 hours. But the credit check occurs on the 14th at 10:00 AM, which is more than 24 hours after application (Jan 12 09:00). So this violates the desideratum timing recommendation of a credit check within 24 hours.

Next steps:

- Risk Assessment at 11:00 AM same day. Still within the same day but not sure about days count here. Wait, January 14 is two days after Jan 12? No, Application received on Jan 12, so application timestamp is 09:00 Jan 12. Credit check is next day, Jan 13 (date?), wait no: looking at Event Log:

Wait the Case ID 3 has entries up to Jan 17. Let me recheck.

Case 3's events:

- Application Received on 2024-01-12 09:00.

Then next event is Credit Check on 2024-01-14 10:00. So that's three days later? From January 12 noon to January 14 noon is two full days, but the credit check happens at 10 AM on Jan 14, which is more than 24 hours after application (Jan 12 09:00). Therefore, violates the desideratum timing for Credit Check within 24 hours.

Then Risk Assessment and Loan Decision all happen same day as credit check. Then Inform Applicant on January 16 15:00. The loan decision was at 12:00 PM Jan 14. Adding from Jan 14 noon to Jan 16 noon is two days, so informing the applicant more than 48 hours later violates the desideratum promptness for informing.

Loan Decision (Approved) followed by Finalize Documentation on Jan 17 09:00 and Close Case at 10:00 AM same day. So no follow-up call, which is a desideratum recommendation but not required. But since it's encouraged but not strict, missing it isn't a violation of the rules but just suboptimal.

**So summarizing violations:**

**Normative Violations (Strict Rules):**

- **Case 2:** Two main issues:
  1. Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check, violating the sequence where Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.
  2. After Loan Decision was Rejected at 09:00, they proceeded to Finalize Documentation at 10:00, which is not allowed as per rules (finalization only if approved).

**Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal but Not Severe):**

- **Case 3:** 
  1. Credit Check occurred more than 24 hours after application receipt.
  2. Applicant was informed over 48 hours after the loan decision.
  3. No Follow-up Call was made before closing, which is recommended but not required.

**Possible Interpretations/Justifications:**

- In Case 2, maybe there was an error in logging the sequence. Perhaps Risk Assessment was intended first, but that would still violate the normative rules unless there's a misunderstanding of requirements. But according to the given constraints, Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment unconditionally. So even if they thought otherwise, it's a violation.

- For Case 3's timing: The delay in credit check might be due to extenuating circumstances (like applicant not available), but that's beyond process control and still a suboptimal choice.

- Missing follow-up call could be an oversight or considered unnecessary by the team, even though recommended.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

**1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Rules):**
- **Case 2:**  
  - *Violates:* Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment and Loan Decision/Decision logic adherence.  
    - Conducted "Risk Assessment" at 08:20 before the required "Credit Check."  
    - Performed "Finalize Documentation" after a rejected decision (violation of rule).  

**2. Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal but Not Severe):**
- **Case 3:**  
  - *Violates:* Timeliness and completeness recommendations.  
    - Credit Check occurred **13 days + 10 hours** post-application (exceeding 24-hour desideratum).  
    - Applicant was informed **46+ hours** after the loan decision (beyond 48-hour recommendation).  
    - No "Follow-up Call" before closing, missing encouraged best practice.  

**3. Interpretations/Justifications:**
- **Case 2:** Log errors may indicate misordered activities due to process misunderstanding or oversight but still strictly violate rules.  
- **Case 3:** Delays might stem from applicant unavailability or systemic inefficiencies; however, these reflect suboptimal performance rather than rule-breaking.  

**Final Answer:**  
- **Normative Violations (Strict Rules):** Case 2 (\boxed{2}) has two violations: out-of-sequence Risk Assessment and finalizing documentation post-rejection.  
- **Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal Practices):** Case 3 (\boxed{3}) violates timing for credit check, applicant notification delay, and omits a follow-up call.
