**Summary:**

This process model delineates the steps involved in approving an invoice from receipt to payment scheduling, incorporating the roles of various participants, decision points, and exception handling mechanisms. It reflects the standard workflow while accommodating variations and exceptions as described by the stakeholders. The model is structured to be clear and logical, providing a comprehensive guide for converting it into a BPMN diagram without ambiguity.
