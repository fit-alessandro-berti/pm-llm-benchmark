Here’s a list of targeted, open-ended questions to clarify and deepen understanding of the property onboarding process:

### **Documentation & Initial Review**
1. What are the most common deficiencies in the initial documentation submitted by landlords? How do you handle disputes if they refuse to provide updates?
2. How do you ensure the property complies with local housing regulations? Are there specific compliance teams involved, or is this handled by the coordinator?
3. What criteria determine whether a property is accepted or rejected at the initial review stage?

### **Property Manager Assignment**
4. How is the workload of property managers assessed before assigning them to a new property?
5. What happens if no property manager has the right specialization (e.g., luxury units) in the property’s location? Are there backup protocols?
6. How do you handle landlord requests for specific property managers (e.g., if they’ve worked with someone before)?

### **Inspection & Marketing**
7. What are the most frequent inspection failures you encounter, and how are they typically resolved?
8. Who bears the cost if major repairs are needed before the property can be listed? Is there a threshold for what the company will cover vs. landlord responsibility?
9. How often are marketing materials (photos, listings) updated after initial onboarding? Is this triggered by tenant turnover, market shifts, or other factors?

### **Tenant Screening & Leasing**
10. What are the key factors in deciding between multiple qualified tenants (e.g., credit score vs. lease length)?
11. How do you handle tenants who fail screening but still want to rent? Are there alternative processes (e.g., guarantors)?
12. Who has final approval authority for lease terms—property managers, landlords, or a legal team?

### **Compliance & Audits**
13. How often are internal audits conducted on onboarding processes? Are there automated checks or manual reviews?
14. What’s the process if a lease clause violates fair housing rules? Who intervenes, and how is it corrected?
15. How do you ensure pricing aligns with market trends? Are there external tools used, or is it based on internal data?

### **Exceptions & Communication**
16. How do you handle landlords who insist on non-standard lease terms (e.g., unusual pet policies)?
17. What are the most common exceptions in this process (e.g., properties needing special insurance), and how are they resolved?
18. How do you track communication across different teams (CRM, email, etc.)? Are there bottlenecks in coordination between departments?

### **Timing & Handoffs**
19. What’s the typical timeframe from initial landlord contact to property activation in the rental portal?
20. Are there any steps in the process that often cause delays, and how do you mitigate them?
21. How do you ensure smooth handoffs between stages (e.g., from inspection to marketing)?

### **Technology & Tools**
22. What tools or systems are used to track the status of a property’s onboarding process? Is there visibility across teams?
23. How do property managers access and update property information in real time?

These questions aim to uncover gaps, clarify roles, and understand how the process adapts to variations—ultimately helping you map the workflow more accurately. Would any of these lead to follow-up questions based on their answers?
