1. **Normative rule violations (strict constraints)**

- **Case 1**  
  - Sequence:  
    Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
  - All ordering constraints are respected:  
    - Credit Check before Risk Assessment   
    - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision   
    - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision   
    - Approved  Finalize Documentation before Close Case   
  - **Conclusion:** Case 1 **does not violate** any normative rules.

- **Case 2**  
  - Actual sequence:  
    Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
  - Violations:
    1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  
       - Violates rule: *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment*.  
       - The process performs Risk Assessment at 08:20, then Credit Check at 09:00.
    2. **Finalize Documentation after a rejection**  
       - Violates rule: *If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case (in fact, not at all).*  
       - Here, Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30 is followed by Finalize Documentation at 10:00.  
  - The sequence also deviates from the prescribed normative pattern:  
    - It skips the required order “Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment” by doing Risk Assessment early.  
    - Perform a forbidden action after rejection (Finalize Documentation).
  - **Conclusion:** Case 2 **violates normative rules** in two ways:
    - Wrong order: Risk Assessment before Credit Check.  
    - Forbidden activity: Finalize Documentation after a rejection.

- **Case 3**  
  - Sequence:  
    Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
  - All ordering constraints are respected:  
    - Application Received first   
    - Credit Check before Risk Assessment   
    - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision   
    - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision   
    - Approved  Finalize Documentation before Close Case   
  - “Follow-up Call” is only a desideratum, not a strict requirement, so its absence is **not** a normative problem.  
  - **Conclusion:** Case 3 **does not violate** any normative rules.

**Summary for Part 1**  
- Norm-compliant: **Case 1, Case 3**  
- Norm-violating: **Case 2** (ordering error + forbidden documentation after rejection)


2. **Desiderata violations (non-strict recommendations)**

Desiderata (soft constraints):
- Credit Check within ~24 hours after Application Received.  
- Inform Applicant within ~48 hours after Loan Decision.  
- Perform Follow-up Call before Close Case (recommended but optional).

- **Case 1**
  - Application  Credit Check: 09:00  09:30 (same day, 30 minutes)   
  - Loan Decision  Inform Applicant: 11:00  13:00 (2 hours)   
  - No mention of Follow-up Call, but its absence is *allowed* and only suboptimal if valued.  
  - **Conclusion:** Case 1 **meets all timing desiderata**; at most, it may be seen as not using the optional Follow-up Call.

- **Case 2**
  - Application  Risk Assessment occurs quickly, but the recommendation is specifically about timing of **Credit Check** and **informing applicant**, not Risk Assessment.
  - Application  Credit Check: 08:00  09:00 (1 hour)  (within 24 hours).  
  - Loan Decision  Inform Applicant:  
    - There is **no explicit “Inform Applicant”** event in the log.  
    - Since the recommendation is to inform within ~48 hours, the lack of a recorded “Inform Applicant” can be viewed as a **desideratum violation** (suboptimal, not a strict breach).
  - No Follow-up Call present (again, only a recommendation).  
  - **Conclusion:** Case 2 likely **fails desiderata** by:
    - Not having an explicit “Inform Applicant” step within the recommended window (or at all).  
    - Possibly also by not performing a Follow-up Call (suboptimal but not wrong).

- **Case 3**
  - Application  Credit Check:  
    - 2024-01-12 09:00  2024-01-14 10:00  
    - This is > 48 hours (clearly beyond the recommended 24 hours).  
    - **Desideratum violation**: delayed Credit Check.
  - Loan Decision  Inform Applicant:  
    - 2024-01-14 12:00  2024-01-16 15:00  
    - About 2 days + 3 hours ( 51 hours), exceeding the recommended 48 hours.  
    - **Desideratum violation**: delayed informing of applicant.
  - Follow-up Call: not present. Since Follow-up Call is encouraged but optional, omission is **suboptimal but acceptable**.  
  - **Conclusion:** Case 3 **violates multiple desiderata**:
    - Late Credit Check.  
    - Late Inform Applicant.  
    - No Follow-up Call (only a soft omission).

**Summary for Part 2**  
- Clear desiderata violations:
  - **Case 3**: Late Credit Check; late Inform Applicant; no Follow-up Call.
  - **Case 2**: Likely missing or unlogged Inform Applicant; no Follow-up Call (suboptimal).  
- Compliant with recommendations:
  - **Case 1**: Within all recommended time windows; only lacks an optional Follow-up Call.


3. **Possible interpretations / justifications**

- **Case 1 (fully compliant, best practice)**  
  - This is an example of both normative and desiderata compliance.  
  - Efficient execution: quick Credit Check and timely communication.  
  - Could be seen as the “reference” or “ideal” behavior.

- **Case 2 (norm violation + soft deviations)**  
  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check:
    - Might indicate a procedural error, incomplete training, or a system that allowed an analyst to start evaluating risk based on partial data.  
    - Could also reflect a mis-logged event (e.g., timestamps or labels entered incorrectly).
  - Finalize Documentation after a rejection:
    - Might be an incorrect use of the “Finalize Documentation” activity to mean “record and archive rejection,” which conflicts with the intended semantics.  
    - Alternatively, it may reflect a misguided attempt to “clean up” the file, but under the given rules, it is not allowed.
  - Missing Inform Applicant:
    - Could be a documentation gap: applicant might have been informed via a channel that isn’t logged (e.g., automatic email outside this system).  
    - From a compliance perspective, it’s a desideratum issue, not a hard violation under the given rules.

- **Case 3 (normatively correct but operationally slow)**  
  - Late Credit Check and late Inform Applicant:
    - Could be due to workload, holidays/weekend gaps, or waiting for external data (e.g., credit bureau delays).  
    - The process remains legally/structurally correct but may hurt customer satisfaction or internal SLAs.
  - No Follow-up Call:
    - Might indicate this recommendation is not systematically integrated into the process or is only used in exceptional cases.  
    - Since the process is otherwise compliant, this case shows how the system satisfies core rules while sacrificing customer-experience-oriented best practices.

Overall:
- **Normative compliance** is strict and only Case 2 fails it.  
- **Desiderata compliance** is softer, with Cases 2 and 3 showing suboptimal behavior mainly in timing and optional communication, but only Case 2 is actually problematic in terms of rules.
