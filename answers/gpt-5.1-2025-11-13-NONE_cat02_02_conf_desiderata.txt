1. **Normative rule violations (strict rules)**

- **Case 1**  
  - Sequence followed exactly:  
    Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
  - No step is skipped, order is correct, documentation is finalized only after approval, and closing the case happens at the end.  
   **Case 1 does not violate any normative rule.**

- **Case 2**  
  - Problem 1: **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  
    - Required: Credit Check  Risk Assessment.  
    - Observed:  
      - 08:20 Risk Assessment  
      - 09:00 Credit Check  
    - This directly violates the ordering rule: “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.”

  - Problem 2: **Finalize Documentation after a rejection**  
    - Required:
      - If Approved  Finalize Documentation before Close Case.  
      - If Rejected  Close Case without finalizing documentation.
    - Observed:  
      - 09:30 Loan Decision (Rejected)  
      - 10:00 Finalize Documentation  
      - 10:30 Close Case  
    - This violates: “If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.”

  - Sequence logic also effectively broken:
    - Risk Assessment is done in the wrong place.
    - Documentation is finalized when the path should be “Reject  Inform Applicant (recommended but not stated as mandatory)  Close Case” without finalization.
  
   **Case 2 violates multiple normative rules:**
    - Wrong order: Risk Assessment before Credit Check.  
    - Prohibited action: Finalize Documentation after a rejection.

- **Case 3**  
  - Order and decision logic:
    - 09:00 Application Received  
    - 10:00 Credit Check  
    - 11:00 Risk Assessment  
    - 12:00 Loan Decision (Approved)  
    - 15:00 Inform Applicant  
    - 09:00 Finalize Documentation  
    - 10:00 Close Case  
  - All mandatory order relations are satisfied:
    - Credit Check before Risk Assessment.  
    - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision.  
    - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision.  
    - Approved  Finalize Documentation before Close Case.
  - No forbidden action (e.g., finalizing documentation after rejection) occurs.

   **Case 3 does not violate any normative rule.**

---

2. **Desiderata (recommended, not strict) violations**

These are not serious violations; they indicate suboptimal adherence to best practices.

- **Case 1**  
  - Timing:
    - Credit Check is 30 minutes after application  within the recommended 24 hours.  
    - Inform Applicant is 2 hours after decision  within the recommended 48 hours.  
  - Follow-up Call:
    - Not mentioned, but there is no requirement that it must happen; it's just encouraged.  
    - From the given log, we cannot say it *should* have happened or that its absence is a problem, since the example desiderata mention it as optional.
  
   **Case 1 does not clearly violate any stated desiderata.** It is fully compliant with both the strict rules and the recommendations we can evaluate from the data.

- **Case 2**  
  - Timing:
    - Risk Assessment happens very soon after Application Received.  
    - Inform Applicant is not shown at all, but this is not stated as mandatory or as a timing desideratum in the table. The given desiderata focus on:
      - Credit Check within ~24 hours of application.  
      - Inform Applicant within ~48 hours of decision.  
    - Credit Check is done 1 hour after application  within 24 hours, so no timing issue.
  - Follow-up Call:
    - Not present, but again, this is “encouraged—not strictly required.”  
    - Its absence is at most a minor desideratum deviation.

   **Case 2 may be seen as suboptimal for not including a Follow-up Call**, but its main problems are normative (not merely desiderata). No clear timing desideratum is violated.

- **Case 3**  
  - Timing desiderata clearly violated:
    - **Credit Check timing**  
      - Application: 2024-01-12 09:00  
      - Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00  
      - Gap: ~49 hours  exceeds the recommended “within 24 hours.”  
       This **violates the Credit Check timing desideratum** (but not a strict rule).
    - **Inform Applicant timing**  
      - Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00  
      - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00  
      - Gap: ~51 hours  exceeds the recommended “within 48 hours.”  
       This **violates the Inform Applicant timing desideratum** (slightly).
  - **Follow-up Call desideratum**:
    - No Follow-up Call is recorded.  
    - The description explicitly notes “*(No Follow-up Call)*” as a desideratum violation.  
     This **violates the recommendation to perform a Follow-up Call** before closing the case.

   **Case 3 violates multiple desiderata but remains fully compliant with the strict normative rules.**

3. Possible interpretations / justifications

- **Case 1 (fully compliant and aligned with desiderata)**  
  - Interpretation: This is a “model” case. It suggests a well-functioning process:
    - Automated or efficient Credit Check shortly after application.  
    - Prompt risk assessment and decision.  
    - Timely communication to the applicant and quick documentation handling.  
  - This could reflect a standard workflow for straightforward, low-risk applications.

- **Case 2 (normative violations)**  
  - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**:
    - Possible interpretation:  
      - A process deviation or staff error (starting qualitative risk assessment based on incomplete information).  
      - A mis-logged activity where the label “Risk Assessment” was used prematurely (e.g., initial risk screening recorded as full assessment).
    - From a governance perspective, this is a serious issue: the decision is being prepared on potentially incomplete or unverified credit data.
  - **Finalize Documentation after rejection**:
    - Possible interpretations:  
      - Misuse of the “Finalize Documentation” activity to mean “finalize rejection paperwork,” whereas the normative rule assumed it refers to finalizing loan contract documentation for an approved loan.  
      - An actual process violation where staff proceeded with preparation of loan documents even though the loan was rejected (likely an error or a misunderstanding of system status).
    - Under the given normative interpretation, this is clearly not allowed; the process logic around approved vs. rejected cases needs clarification and possibly system-enforced checks.
  - **Lack of Follow-up Call**:
    - As a desideratum, its absence could indicate workload pressure, low perceived value for rejected cases, or simply that follow-ups are reserved for approved or borderline cases.

- **Case 3 (normatively compliant but suboptimal timings and no follow-up)**  
  - **Late Credit Check (49 hours)**:
    - Possible justifications:
      - Backlog or resource constraints in the credit department.  
      - Suspicion requiring additional data from external bureaus or manual verification.  
      - Weekend or non-working days between application and processing.
  - **Late Inform Applicant (51 hours after decision)**:
    - Possible justifications:
      - Manual notification processes that depend on human availability.  
      - Additional internal approvals after the formal decision but before informing the applicant.  
      - Applicant requested a specific contact time or channel, causing delay.
  - **No Follow-up Call**:
    - Possible justifications:
      - Case considered straightforward; no need for further clarification.  
      - Time constraints or policy prioritizing follow-up calls only for high-value or complex loans.  
    - While not a serious issue, it reduces the quality of applicant engagement compared to the recommended best practice.

**Summary**

- **Normative violations:**  
  - **Case 2** only: wrong order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and prohibited action (Finalize Documentation after rejection).  
  - **Cases 1 and 3** fully respect the strict ordering and decision logic.

- **Desiderata violations (suboptimal but not severe):**  
  - **Case 1:** None clearly identifiable from the data.  
  - **Case 2:** Possibly no Follow-up Call (minor), but main issues are normative, not desiderata.  
  - **Case 3:**  
    - Credit Check much later than 24 hours after application.  
    - Inform Applicant more than 48 hours after decision.  
    - No Follow-up Call before closing.
