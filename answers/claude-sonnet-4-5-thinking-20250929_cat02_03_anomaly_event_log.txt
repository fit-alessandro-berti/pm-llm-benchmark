# Procure-to-Pay Anomaly Analysis

## Standard P2P Process Flow
For reference, the expected sequence is:
1. Create Purchase Requisition
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. Vendor Invoice Received
6. **Match Invoice to PO** (Three-way match)
7. **Release Payment**
8. Close Case

## Case-by-Case Analysis

### **Case 1001:  NORMAL**
This case follows the standard P2P process sequence correctly with proper controls in place.

---

### **Case 1002:  MULTIPLE CRITICAL ANOMALIES**

**Sequence Issues:**
1. **PO Issued Before Requisition Approval**
   - PO issued at 08:40 on Feb 1
   - Approval occurred at 08:00 on Feb 3
   - **Problem:** Bypasses authorization controls; violates segregation of duties

2. **Payment Released Before Receiving Goods**
   - Payment: Feb 3 at 07:15
   - Goods received: Feb 4 at 09:00
   - **Problem:** Company paid for goods not yet received; risk of fraud or non-delivery

3. **Payment Released Before Invoice Matching**
   - Payment: Feb 3 at 07:15
   - Matching: Feb 5 at 08:00
   - **Problem:** No three-way match validation; cannot verify price, quantity, or terms

4. **Payment Before Requisition Approval**
   - Payment: Feb 3 at 07:15
   - Approval: Feb 3 at 08:00
   - **Problem:** Complete bypass of authorization controls

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL - Multiple financial control violations

---

### **Case 1003:  CRITICAL ANOMALIES**

**Sequence Issues:**
1. **Payment Released Before Invoice Received**
   - Payment: Feb 8 at 11:00
   - Invoice received: Feb 9 at 12:00
   - **Problem:** Paying without documentation; no invoice to reference for payment justification

2. **Payment Released Before Goods Receipt**
   - Payment: Feb 8 at 11:00
   - Goods received: Feb 10 at 13:00
   - **Problem:** Prepayment without goods confirmation; high fraud risk

3. **Payment Before Three-Way Match**
   - Payment: Feb 8 at 11:00
   - Matching: Feb 11 at 14:00
   - **Problem:** Cannot validate accuracy of payment amount or terms

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL - Paying before any verification; potential fraud or error

---

### **Case 1004:  MAJOR ANOMALY**

**Sequence Issue:**
1. **Goods Received Before PO Issued**
   - Goods received: Feb 6 at 09:00
   - PO issued: Feb 6 at 09:15
   - **Problem:** This is "maverick buying" or unauthorized procurement; goods received without formal purchase commitment

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- No pre-negotiated pricing or terms
- Contract compliance issues
- Supplier relationship management problems
- Budget tracking failures
- Potential quality control bypasses
- Weakens negotiating position (already have the goods)

**Risk Level:** HIGH - Control bypass, but subsequent steps follow proper sequence

## Summary of Key Control Violations

| Case | Primary Violation | Business Impact |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1002 | Payment before approval, goods, and matching | Fraud risk, unauthorized spending, payment errors |
| 1003 | Payment before invoice, goods, and matching | Financial exposure, documentation gaps, audit failures |
| 1004 | Goods received before PO issued | Unauthorized procurement, contract non-compliance |

**Recommendations:**
- Implement system controls to enforce sequential dependencies
- Strengthen segregation of duties
- Add automated validation checkpoints before payment release
- Investigate Cases 1002 and 1003 for potential fraud
- Review authorization protocols for Case 1004
