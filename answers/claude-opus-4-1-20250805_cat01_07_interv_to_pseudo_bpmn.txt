# BPMN-Like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

## Process Overview
The invoice approval process involves multiple departments and roles to ensure proper validation, matching, and approval of supplier invoices before payment scheduling.

## Participants/Swim Lanes
- **Accounts Payable (AP)** - Primary: AP Clerk (Mary), Secondary: AP Supervisor (Rita)
- **Purchasing Department** - Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- **Department Management** - Department Manager (Carlos)
- **External Support** - Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
- **External** - Supplier

## Process Flow

### Main Process Path

**START EVENT:** Invoice Received (typically via email)

**TASK 1:** Check for PO Number [AP Clerk]
- Input: Invoice from supplier
- Output: Decision on PO presence

**GATEWAY 1 (Exclusive):** PO Number Present?
- **NO Path:**  TASK 2A: Request PO Details from Supplier [AP Clerk]
  - May involve Supplier Relationship Manager for assistance
  - Loops back to TASK 1 when revised invoice received
- **YES Path:**  Continue to TASK 3

**TASK 3:** Log Invoice in Accounting System [AP Clerk]
- Input: Invoice with valid PO number
- Output: System-logged invoice

**TASK 4:** Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation [AP Clerk]
- Output: Email/notification to Purchasing Department

**TASK 5:** Verify Goods/Services Receipt and PO Match [Purchasing Officer]
- Input: Invoice details, PO information
- Activities: Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges

**GATEWAY 2 (Exclusive):** Does Invoice Match PO and Receipt?
- **YES Path:**  TASK 7: Send Confirmation to AP [Purchasing Officer]
- **NO Path (Discrepancy):**  SUB-PROCESS: Discrepancy Resolution

### Discrepancy Resolution Sub-Process

**GATEWAY 2A (Exclusive):** Can Discrepancy Be Resolved at Department Level?
- **Simple Issues:** 
  - TASK 6A: Contact Supplier for Correction [Purchasing/AP Clerk]
  - May involve Supplier Relationship Manager
  - Returns corrected invoice to main flow at TASK 5
- **Complex Issues:**
  - TASK 6B: Escalate to AP Supervisor [AP Clerk]
  - TASK 6C: Investigate and Coordinate Resolution [AP Supervisor]
    - May create retrospective PO for informal services
    - May involve department heads
    - May result in invoice rejection
  - Returns to main flow at TASK 5 after resolution

### Approval and Payment Scheduling

**TASK 7:** Match Invoice Line Items Against PO [AP Clerk]
- Input: Purchasing confirmation
- Output: Matched invoice ready for approval

**TASK 8:** Send for Manager Approval [System/AP Clerk]
- Automatic email notification triggered
- Input: Matched and confirmed invoice

**TASK 9:** Review and Approve Invoice [Department Manager]
- Input: Invoice details, PO, confirmation from Purchasing
- Review: Quantities, pricing, budget alignment

**GATEWAY 3 (Exclusive):** Manager Decision?
- **APPROVE:**  TASK 10
- **REJECT/HOLD:**  Returns to TASK 6B (Escalation to AP Supervisor)
  - Note: Occurs approximately once every couple of months

**TASK 10:** Schedule for Payment [AP Clerk]
- Input: Approved invoice
- Output: Invoice added to payment cycle/run

**END EVENT:** Invoice Scheduled for Payment

## Key Business Rules
1. No invoice processing without valid PO number (except rare informal service contracts)
2. Purchasing confirmation required before manager approval
3. Manager approval required after matching and confirmation
4. AP Supervisor handles all complex exceptions and escalations

## Data Objects/Artifacts
- Invoice (electronic, typically email)
- Purchase Order (PO)
- Accounting System Records
- Confirmation Emails
- Payment Schedule

## Exception Handling Notes
- Missing PO scenarios may require retrospective PO creation
- Pricing discrepancies involve Supplier Relationship Manager for contract verification
- Unresolvable discrepancies escalate to AP Supervisor
- Manager rejections (rare) loop back through escalation process

## Process Variations/Ambiguities
- The exact trigger mechanism for manager approval notifications (automatic vs. manual) appears to be system-driven but may vary
- The role of Supplier Relationship Manager appears to be consultative and may be invoked at various discrepancy resolution points
- Some informal service contracts may bypass standard PO requirements but require special handling through AP Supervisor
