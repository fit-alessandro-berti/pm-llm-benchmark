### Comprehensive Event Log for Process Mining

Below is the integrated event log derived from the provided ERP system tables. Each row represents a single event associated with an `order_id`, capturing the activity, timestamp, responsible resource, and relevant attributes.

**Assumptions Made:**
- **Order Completion:** An order is considered complete after the final payment is received.
- **Items Picked:** Each item picking is treated as a separate "Items Picked" event.
- **Invoice Issuance:** Each invoice generation is a separate "Invoice Issued" event.
- **Payment Received:** Each payment installment is treated as a separate "Payment Received" event.
- **Resources:** Mapped using the `Resources Table` based on relevant IDs from other tables.
