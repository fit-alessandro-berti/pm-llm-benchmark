To diagnose the root causes of performance issues in your process based on the given directly follows graph for different object types, here are specific considerations focused on process and data:

### Container
1. **Order Empty Containers -> Pick Up Empty Container:**
   - **Duration:** 368943.92 seconds (~4.3 days)
   - **Insight:** This activity pair has an extremely high duration, suggesting significant delays between ordering and picking up empty containers.

2. **Pick Up Empty Container -> Load Truck:**
   - **Duration:** 38659.62 seconds (~10.7 hours)
   - **Insight:** Once containers are picked up, they also take considerable time to be loaded onto the truck.

3. **Place in Stock -> Bring to Loading Bay:**
   - **Duration:** 743380.51 seconds (~8.6 days)
   - **Insight:** Moving containers from stock to the loading bay is taking an exceptionally long time, indicating potential issues in inventory management or resource allocation.

4. **Order Empty Containers -> Depart:**
   - **Duration:** 1007066.16 seconds (~11.6 days)
   - **Insight:** The overall duration from ordering empty containers to departure is very high, highlighting inefficiencies through the full chain which includes ordering, picking up and loading.

### Truck
1. **Drive to Terminal -> Load Truck:**
   - **Duration:** 84119.09 seconds (~23.4 hours)
   - **Insight:** After driving to the terminal, trucks take a long time to return to loading, indicating potential routing or scheduling inefficiencies.

### Vehicle
1. **Book Vehicles -> Book Vehicles:**
   - **Duration:** 295965.56 seconds (~3.4 days)
   - **Insight:** Continuous booking of vehicles with this high duration suggests issues in vehicle availability or scheduling.

2. **Book Vehicles -> Load to Vehicle:**
   - **Duration:** 283101.01 seconds (~3.3 days)
   - **Insight:** Lag between vehicle booking and actual loading indicates an inefficiency in coordination between vehicle booking and the physical loading process.

3. **Reschedule Container -> Book Vehicles:**
   - **Duration:** 22237.92 seconds (~6.2 hours)
   - **Insight:** Rescheduling containers significantly impacts the vehicle booking process.

### Handling Unit
1. **Collect Goods -> Load Truck:**
   - **Duration:** 7820.93 seconds (~2.2 hours)
   - **Insight:** While not as high as other durations, this step still takes time which might be improved through better synchronization or more effective resource allocation.

### Forklift
1. **Place in Stock -> Bring to Loading Bay:**
   - **Duration:** 112600.53 seconds (~1.3 days)
   - **Insight:** This duration is also significantly high, indicating delays in moving items from stock to the loading bay via forklifts.

### Customer Order and Transport Document
1. **Register Customer Order -> Create Transport Document:**
   - **Duration:** 329005.22 seconds (~3.8 days)
   - **Insight:** Creating transport documents from customer orders takes a long time. This lag can affect subsequent processes.

2. **Order Empty Containers -> Depart (Transport Document):**
   - **Duration:** 1007066.16 seconds (~11.6 days)
   - **Insight:** Similar to the container object type, this step in the transport document process reveals extensive delays, indicating a systemic issue across the whole chain.

### Summary of Key Delays
- Ordering and picking up containers.
- Moving containers from stock to loading bay and relevant forklift operations.
- Use and scheduling of trucks and vehicles.
- Processing times for creating transport documents and rescheduling operations.

**Addressing these delays involves looking into specific inefficiencies such as:** 
- Inventory management strategies.
- Resource allocation and scheduling for trucks, forklifts, and vehicles.
- Coordination between booking, loading, and container handling.
- Optimization of document processing and rescheduling workflows.

Understanding and mitigating these specific delays can significantly improve the performance of your process.
