Based on the provided attributes, the sensitive attributes for fairness are:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether a person is a citizen or not. Fairness issues may arise if the process treats citizens and non-citizens differently.
2. `case:german speaking`: This attribute indicates whether a person speaks German or not. Fairness issues may arise if the process treats German-speaking individuals differently from non-German-speaking individuals.
3. `case:gender`: This attribute indicates the gender of a person. Fairness issues may arise if the process treats individuals of different genders differently.
4. `case:married`: This attribute indicates whether a person is married or not. Fairness issues may arise if the process treats married individuals differently from unmarried individuals.

These attributes are sensitive because they can be used to discriminate against certain groups of people. For example, if the process is less likely to approve a rental application for non-citizens or unmarried individuals, this could be considered unfair.

It's essential to analyze the process and its outcomes to ensure that these sensitive attributes are not being used to make unfair decisions. This can be done by applying fairness metrics and techniques, such as:

* Statistical parity: This metric measures the difference in outcomes between different groups (e.g., citizens vs. non-citizens).
* Equalized odds: This metric measures the difference in true positive rates and false positive rates between different groups.
* Calibration: This metric measures the difference in predicted probabilities of a positive outcome between different groups.

By analyzing these fairness metrics, you can identify potential biases in the process and take steps to address them, ensuring that the process is fair and unbiased.
