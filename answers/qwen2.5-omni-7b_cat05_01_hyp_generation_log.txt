To identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the given event log data, we need to analyze the sequence of events and compare them with the assumed normal process flow. Here are some potential anomalies that can be identified from the example data:

1. **Register Order  Confirm Shipment**: This step is missing between "Register Order" and "Ship Goods." It seems like there was an issue where the order was confirmed but not shipped.

2. **Perform Credit Check  Validate Stock**: There's no "Validate Stock" event after "Perform Credit Check," which suggests that the credit check might have been skipped or performed incorrectly.

3. **Issue Invoice  Receive Payment**: In one instance ("case_id": 1004), the payment was received before the invoice was issued. This could indicate a billing error or a different business process.

4. **Late Confirmation**: In "case_id": 1003, the confirmation of shipment occurred later than expected, suggesting a delay or issue in the logistics process.

Given these observations, let’s propose relevant SQL queries to investigate these hypotheses further:

### Query 1: Identify Missing Confirm Shipment Events
```sql
SELECT o.case_id, ol.event_id, ol.activity, ol.timestamp, ol.resource, ol.additional_info
FROM order_event_log ol
JOIN orders o ON ol.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE ol.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log ol2 
    WHERE ol2.case_id = o.case_id AND ol2.activity = 'Ship Goods'
);
```

### Query 2: Identify Missing Validate Stock Events After Credit Check
```sql
SELECT o.case_id, ol.event_id, ol.activity, ol.timestamp, ol.resource, ol.additional_info
FROM order_event_log ol
JOIN orders o ON ol.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE ol.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_event_log ol2 
    WHERE ol2.case_id = o.case_id AND ol2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
);
```

### Query 3: Identify Inverse Order of Invoice and Payment
```sql
SELECT o.case_id, ol.event_id, ol.activity, ol.timestamp, ol.resource, ol.additional_info
FROM order_event_log ol
JOIN orders o ON ol.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE ol.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND ol.event_id > (
    SELECT MAX(event_id) 
    FROM order_event_log 
    WHERE case_id = o.case_id AND activity = 'Issue Invoice'
);
```

### Query 4: Identify Late Confirmations
```sql
SELECT o.case_id, ol.event_id, ol.activity, ol.timestamp, ol.resource, ol.additional_info
FROM order_event_log ol
JOIN orders o ON ol.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE ol.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND ol.timestamp > (
    SELECT MIN(timestamp) 
    FROM order_event_log 
    WHERE case_id = o.case_id AND activity = 'Ship Goods'
);
```

These queries will help us pinpoint specific cases where anomalies may have occurred and provide insights into possible causes such as system errors, policy violations, or training issues. By analyzing the results of these queries, we can hypothesize about the underlying reasons behind each anomaly and take corrective actions if necessary.
