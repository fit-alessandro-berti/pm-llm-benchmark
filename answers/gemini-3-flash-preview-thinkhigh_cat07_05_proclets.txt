The provided image is a technical visualization, likely from a process modeling or computer science paper, depicting a workflow for laboratory procedures using "proclets." It is divided into three parts:

### (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels
This is the central part of the visualization, showing two concurrent workflows (proclets) and how they communicate.

*   **Lab Visit (Left):** This workflow begins when a patient visits. Steps include **Order entry** (by a doctor) and **Take blood sample** (by a lab assistant). After the sample is taken, a message is sent via the "Order system" to initiate a lab test. The workflow continues to **Judge results**, where it may branch depending on the outcome: **Everything fine**, **Receive result**, or **Do tests again**. It concludes with **Send report** (by a lab assistant).
*   **Lab Test (Right):** This workflow is triggered by the Order system. Steps include **Perform test** and **Make report** (both by a chemical analyst). Communication then occurs via the "HIS" (Hospital Information System) channel. This workflow can also branch into **Finish lab test** or **Perform test again** followed by **Provide updated report**.
*   **Communication Channels:** Two dashed boxes represent communication interfaces:
    *   **Order system:** Handles the initial request from the Lab Visit to start a Lab Test.
    *   **HIS (Hospital Information System):** Manages the exchange of results, re-test requests, and updated reports between the two processes.
*   **Notations:** The circles with triangles/squares represent start and end points. Small white arrows indicate the human actors (doctor, assistant, analyst) performing specific tasks. The small bubbles within the channel boxes (e.g., `1..1`, `*,1`) denote cardinality, or the number of instances involved in the exchange.

### (b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes
This is a simplified UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram showing the structural relationship between the two processes.
*   It indicates that a **Lab visit** "requires" a **Lab test**.
*   The multiplicity/cardinality markers show that one Lab visit (`1..1`) is associated with one or more Lab tests (`1..*`).

### (c) Example of a performative
This table provides a concrete example of a single communication event between the two proclets shown in diagram (a). 
*   It details a specific message sent at **11:00** via the **Order system** channel. 
*   The **Sender** is "Lab visit - John," and the **Receiver** is "Lab test - HGB John." 
*   The **Content** is a request: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?" 
*   The **Action** is "Create," indicating this message initiates the Lab test process instance.

Overall, the visualization illustrates how complex, interdependent medical processes are modeled, how they interact through information systems, and how individual data transactions occur within that framework.
