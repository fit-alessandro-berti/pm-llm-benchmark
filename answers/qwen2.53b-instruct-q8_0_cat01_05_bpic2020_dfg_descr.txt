Certainly! The data describes a complex workflow involving multiple steps and transitions between roles, including SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER (not defined in your provided flow but inferred), EMPLOYEE, and possibly an "MISSING" role. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

### Initial Steps
1. **EMPLOYEE SUBMISSION**:
   - The workflow starts with employees submitting declarations.
   - Each declaration then goes through multiple approval stages.

2. **Approval Stages**:
   - **ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL**: Declarations are first approved by an ADMINISTRATION role.
     - If the declaration passes, it moves on to SUPERVISOR for final approval.
     - If rejected at this stage, the employee may need to re-submit their request or resolve issues raised.

3. **Final Approval**:
   - **SUPERVISOR FINAL APPROVAL**: Declarations are then approved by a SUPERVISOR role.
     - This results in a `FINAL_APPROVED` status for the declaration and triggers the next steps: Request Payment or other possible actions (e.g., Handling of payment).

4. **Payment Workflow**:
   - When a declaration is `FINAL_APPROVED`, it triggers a request to process payment.
   - Once the payment is handled, certain statuses are updated.

### Transition Dynamics

1. **Rejections and Resubmissions**:
   - **EMPLOYEE REJECTION**: If an employee rejects their own submission, it gets resubmitted.
   - **ADMINISTRATION REJECTION**: Declarations may be rejected by an ADMINISTRATION role.
     - A rejected declaration can go to a different employee for further review or resolution.

2. **Miscellaneous Actions**:
   - Various actions such as `SUGGEST_REJECTION` and `REQUEST_PAYMENT` are mentioned, but specific details about these roles/conditions were not provided.

3. **Completion Points**:
   - **Payment Handled**: Once the payment is processed, certain final statuses (like `FINAL_APPROVED`) can trigger additional actions.
   - **Final Approvals**: The workflow culminates in `FINAL_APPROVED` which triggers further process steps.

### Summary Process
- An employee submits a declaration that goes through multiple approvals.
- If approved, it proceeds to the SUPERVISOR for final approval and then potentially payment processing.
- Various rejections lead back into earlier stages or trigger additional actions like resubmission.

This workflow is complex due to multiple approvals and potential cascading effects from different rejection points. Each step in the process influences subsequent steps based on outcomes of previous checks, leading to varied paths through the system.
