Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process behavior and the desiderata. The normative rules are strict and must be followed, while the desiderata are recommendations that are nice to have but not mandatory.

Starting with Part 1: Normative Process Behavior. The strict sequence is Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case. The key constraints are about the order of activities and specific conditions based on the loan decision.

Looking at the event log, there are three cases: 1, 2, and 3. Let's check each case against the normative rules.

Case 1:
- Activities in order: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. This seems to follow the sequence correctly. Since the loan was approved, they finalized documentation before closing. No issues here. So Case 1 is compliant.

Case 2:
- The first activity is Application Received. Then, the next activity is Risk Assessment at 2024-01-11 08:20. But according to the rules, Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Here, Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check, which is a violation. Then, Credit Check is done after Risk Assessment, which is out of order. Then Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. But the rules state that if the loan is rejected, you should not finalize documentation. Here, they did finalize documentation after rejection, which is another violation. So Case 2 has two normative violations: out-of-order activities and finalizing documentation after rejection.

Case 3:
- The sequence starts correctly with Application Received. Then Credit Check is on 2024-01-14, which is two days later. But the desiderata mention that Credit Check should be within 24 hours, but that's a desideratum, not a normative rule. So normatively, the order is correct: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. The order is correct. However, the timing between Application and Credit Check is a desideratum issue, not a normative one. Similarly, the time between Loan Decision and Inform Applicant is longer than recommended (48 hours), but again, that's a desideratum. Also, there's no Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum. So Case 3 doesn't violate any normative rules but fails on desiderata.

Now, for Part 2: Desiderata. These are the recommended best practices. For each case, check if they meet the timing recommendations and if a Follow-up Call was made.

Case 1:
- Credit Check was done 30 minutes after Application Received, which is within 24 hours. Good.
- Inform Applicant was 2 hours after Loan Decision, which is within 48 hours. Good.
- There's no mention of a Follow-up Call, but the log doesn't show it. However, the desiderata say it's encouraged but not required. So missing Follow-up Call is a desideratum failure, but not a serious issue. However, looking at the event log for Case 1, the activities listed don't include a Follow-up Call. So that's a desiderata violation.

Wait, but in the event log for Case 3, there's a note "(No Follow-up Call)". For Case 1, the log doesn't mention it either. So both Case 1 and 3 might be missing the Follow-up Call. But the problem statement says "it is encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case". So if the log doesn't show it, then it's a desiderata failure. But in the event log, only Case 3 has a note about no Follow-up Call. Maybe the other cases didn't have it either, but it's not annotated. Hmm, the event log for Case 1 doesn't list a Follow-up Call, so it's missing. Similarly, Case 2 also doesn't have it. But the problem might only mention Case 3's absence. Wait, looking at the event log:

For Case 3, the last line is "3       *(No Follow-up Call)* |                      " So that's explicitly mentioned. For Cases 1 and 2, there's no such note, but the activities listed don't include a Follow-up Call. So perhaps all three cases lack the Follow-up Call, but only Case 3 is noted. But according to the problem statement, the desiderata include the Follow-up Call as encouraged. So any case that doesn't have it is a desiderata failure. However, the event log for Cases 1 and 2 don't show a Follow-up Call, so they also fail that desideratum. But the problem might only mention Case 3's absence. Wait, the user's event log for Case 3 has a row with "(No Follow-up Call)", but Cases 1 and 2 don't have that. So maybe in the log, only Case 3 is noted as missing it, but in reality, all cases might be missing it. But according to the data provided, only Case 3 is explicitly mentioned as having no Follow-up Call. So perhaps the other cases did have it, but it's not listed? Or maybe the log is incomplete. This is a bit ambiguous. The problem says "it is encouraged... to perform a Follow-up Call... before closing the case". So if the log doesn't show it, then it's a desiderata failure. But in the given log, only Case 3 has a note about it. For Cases 1 and 2, the activities are listed, and there's no Follow-up Call activity. So they also didn't perform it. Therefore, all three cases might be missing the Follow-up Call, but only Case 3 is explicitly mentioned. However, the problem might expect us to consider that only Case 3 is noted as missing it. Alternatively, perhaps the log is accurate, and Cases 1 and 2 did have the Follow-up Call, but it's not listed. But that's unlikely. The log shows all activities, so if Follow-up Call isn't there, then it wasn't done. Therefore, all three cases would be missing the Follow-up Call, but the problem's event log only mentions it for Case 3. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the event log again.

Looking at the event log:

For Case 1, the activities are:

1. Application Received
2. Credit Check
3. Risk Assessment
4. Loan Decision (Approved)
5. Inform Applicant
6. Finalize Documentation
7. Close Case

No Follow-up Call. So it's missing.

Case 2:

1. Application Received
2. Risk Assessment (violates normative)
3. Credit Check (out of order)
4. Loan Decision (Rejected)
5. Finalize Documentation (violates normative)
6. Close Case

No Follow-up Call.

Case 3:

1. Application Received
2. Credit Check (delayed)
3. Risk Assessment
4. Loan Decision (Approved)
5. Inform Applicant (delayed)
6. Finalize Documentation
7. Close Case
8. (No Follow-up Call)

So all three cases lack the Follow-up Call. But the problem's event log only explicitly notes it for Case 3. However, since the log doesn't list the Follow-up Call for any case, all three are missing it. Therefore, all three cases fail the desideratum of having a Follow-up Call. But the problem might only mention Case 3's absence. Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is optional, and the log only shows it if it's present. Since none of the cases have it listed, they all fail that desideratum. But the problem's note for Case 3 says "(No Follow-up Call)", which might be a hint that the other cases might have it, but it's not shown. But that's unclear. To be safe, I'll assume that only Case 3 is noted as missing it, but in reality, all cases might be missing it. However, the problem's event log for Cases 1 and 2 don't mention it, so perhaps they did have it, but it's not logged. But that's unlikely. The log should include all activities. Therefore, all three cases are missing the Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum failure. But the problem's example for Case 3 explicitly mentions it, so maybe the others did have it. This is a bit ambiguous. To resolve this, perhaps the Follow-up Call is only mentioned as missing in Case 3, so the others might have it. But since it's not in the log, perhaps they didn't. This is a bit of a problem. Maybe the answer should note that all cases lack the Follow-up Call, but only Case 3 is explicitly mentioned. Alternatively, the problem might expect that only Case 3 is missing it. Given the note in the log for Case 3, I'll proceed under the assumption that only Case 3 is missing the Follow-up Call, and the others might have it (but it's not listed). But that's not logical. If the log doesn't show it, then it wasn't done. Therefore, all three cases are missing the Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum failure. But the problem's note for Case 3 says "(No Follow-up Call)", which might be a hint that the others did have it. But without that activity in the log, we can't assume it was done. So perhaps all three cases are missing it, but only Case 3 is explicitly called out. This is a bit confusing, but I'll proceed with the information given.

Now, for the desiderata:

Case 1:
- Credit Check was 30 minutes after Application: within 24 hours. Good.
- Inform Applicant was 2 hours after Loan Decision: within 48 hours. Good.
- Follow-up Call: Not present in log. So desideratum failure.

But the problem's desiderata mention that failing to do the Follow-up Call is a desideratum violation. So Case 1 would have that as a desiderata failure.

Case 2:
- Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, but normative violation already covered. For desiderata, the timing between Application and Credit Check: Application was at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00 (1 hour later). So within 24 hours. But since the Credit Check was out of order, but the timing is okay. However, the main issue here is the normative violation. For desiderata, the timing is okay. But the Inform Applicant was at 10:00, which is 30 minutes after Loan Decision (09:30). So within 48 hours. But since the loan was rejected, the process should have closed without finalizing documentation. But they did finalize, which is a normative violation. For desiderata, the timing is okay. Follow-up Call: Not present. So desiderata failure for missing Follow-up Call.

Case 3:
- Credit Check was on 2024-01-14 at 10:00, Application was on 2024-01-12 at 09:00. That's about 34 hours later (from 09:00 Jan 12 to 10:00 Jan 14 is 35 hours), which is more than 24 hours. So desiderata violation for timing.
- Loan Decision was at 12:00 on Jan 14, Inform Applicant at 15:00 on Jan 16. That's 27 hours later (from 12:00 Jan14 to 15:00 Jan16 is 27 hours), which is more than 48 hours. So another desiderata violation.
- No Follow-up Call (explicitly noted). So three desiderata violations.

So summarizing:

Normative violations:
- Case 2: Out-of-order activities (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and finalizing documentation after rejection.

Desiderata failures:
- Case 1: Missing Follow-up Call.
- Case 2: Missing Follow-up Call.
- Case 3: Credit Check delayed (>24h), Inform Applicant delayed (>48h), and missing Follow-up Call.

But wait, the problem's event log for Case 3 has a note "(No Follow-up Call)", but the other cases don't. However, since the log doesn't list the Follow-up Call for any case, perhaps all are missing it. But the problem might only consider Case 3 as missing it. Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is optional and not always logged. This is a bit ambiguous. To be precise, based on the log provided, only Case 3 is explicitly mentioned as missing the Follow-up Call. The other cases don't have that note, but their logs also don't show the activity. So perhaps the answer should state that all cases lack the Follow-up Call, but only Case 3 is annotated. However, the problem might expect that only Case 3 is considered as missing it. Alternatively, the presence of the note in Case 3 indicates that the absence is notable, while the others might have had it but it's not shown. But that's not logical. The log should include all activities. Therefore, the absence of the Follow-up Call in the log means it wasn't performed. So all three cases are missing it, leading to desiderata failures. But the problem's note for Case 3 might be emphasizing it. So in the answer, I should mention that all cases lack the Follow-up Call, but perhaps the problem only wants Case 3 mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is not required, so even if it's missing, it's just a desiderata failure. But the problem says "it is encouraged... to perform a Follow-up Call... before closing the case". So if it's not done, it's a desiderata failure. Therefore, all three cases have this failure. But in the event log, only Case 3 is noted. This is conflicting. To resolve, perhaps the answer should mention that all cases lack the Follow-up Call, but the problem's log only explicitly states it for Case 3. However, based on the data provided, since the activity isn't present in any case's log, all three are missing it. Therefore, all three have that desiderata failure. But the problem might expect that only Case 3 is mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is optional and not tracked unless done. But the log should include all activities. This is a bit of a puzzle. To proceed, I'll note that all cases are missing the Follow-up Call, but the problem's example for Case 3 explicitly mentions it. However, in the absence of explicit information, I'll assume that the log is accurate and the Follow-up Call was not performed in any case, leading to desiderata failures for all. But the problem might not expect that. Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is only required if certain conditions are met, but the problem states it's encouraged before closing. So regardless, if it's not done, it's a desiderata failure. Therefore, all three cases have that failure. But the problem's event log for Case 3 has a note, which might be a hint that the others did have it. But without that activity in the log, we can't assume it was done. Therefore, the answer should state that all cases lack the Follow-up Call, but the problem's log only mentions it for Case 3. However, this might be overcomplicating. Let's check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "it is encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case". So if the log doesn't show it, then it wasn't done, hence a desiderata failure. Therefore, all three cases are missing it, leading to desiderata failures. But in the event log, only Case 3 has a note about it. So perhaps the answer should mention that all cases failed to perform the Follow-up Call, but the problem's log only explicitly states it for Case 3. However, the user might expect that only Case 3 is considered as missing it. This is a bit of a dilemma. To be safe, I'll mention that all cases lack the Follow-up Call, but the problem's log only notes it for Case 3. Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is not present in any of the cases, so all three have that desiderata failure. But the problem's example for Case 3 might be highlighting it as an example. So in the answer, I'll list all three cases as missing the Follow-up Call, but the problem's log only mentions it for Case 3. However, since the log doesn't show the activity for any case, it's safe to assume all three are missing it. Therefore, all three cases have desiderata failures related to the Follow-up Call.

But let's look back at the problem's event log. For Case 3, there's a line: "3       *(No Follow-up Call)* |                      ". This indicates that the Follow-up Call was not performed. For Cases 1 and 2, there's no such note, but the activities listed don't include a Follow-up Call. So perhaps the log is incomplete, and the Follow-up Call might have been performed but not logged. However, in process mining, the event log is supposed to capture all activities. Therefore, if it's not in the log, it wasn't performed. Therefore, all three cases are missing the Follow-up Call, leading to desiderata failures. But the problem's note for Case 3 might be emphasizing it. So in the answer, I should mention that all cases failed to perform the Follow-up Call, but the problem's log only explicitly states it for Case 3. However, the user might expect that only Case 3 is considered. Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is optional and not required, so even if it's missing, it's just a desiderata failure. But the problem states it's encouraged, so missing it is a desiderata failure. Therefore, all three cases have that failure. But the problem's example for Case 3 might be the only one mentioned. This is a bit confusing, but I'll proceed with the information given.

Now, for the desiderata:

Case 1:
- Credit Check within 24h: Yes (30 minutes).
- Inform Applicant within 48h of decision: Yes (2 hours).
- Follow-up Call: Missing. So desiderata failure.

Case 2:
- Credit Check timing: Application at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00 (1 hour later). Within 24h. So okay.
- Inform Applicant: 30 minutes after decision. Within 48h. Okay.
- Follow-up Call: Missing. Desiderata failure.

Case 3:
- Credit Check: 34 hours after application. Desiderata violation.
- Inform Applicant: 27 hours after decision. Desiderata violation.
- Follow-up Call: Missing. Desiderata violation.

So all three cases have at least one desiderata failure related to the Follow-up Call. Additionally, Case 3 has two more desiderata violations (timing).

Now, for the task:

1. Identify cases violating normative rules and explain.

Case 2 is the only one with normative violations: doing Risk Assessment before Credit Check and finalizing documentation after rejection.

2. Identify cases failing desiderata.

All three cases fail to have a Follow-up Call. Additionally, Case 3 has timing issues for Credit Check and Inform Applicant.

3. Suggest interpretations or justifications.

For Case 2's normative violations: Maybe there was a misunderstanding of the process, or an error in the system that allowed out-of-order steps. For finalizing documentation after rejection, perhaps a mistake was made where the staff assumed approval but it was rejected.

For desiderata in Case 3: The delay in Credit Check could be due to high workload or system delays. The delay in informing the applicant might be due to holidays or weekends, but the timestamps are within the same week. The missing Follow-up Call could be due to oversight or time constraints.

For Cases 1 and 2 missing Follow-up Call: Possibly due to workload or the call being deemed unnecessary, but it's a best practice.

Now, putting this all together in the answer. 
</think>
### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**

**Case 2** violates the normative rules for the following reasons:  
- **Out-of-Order Activities**: The *Risk Assessment* was performed **before** the *Credit Check* (violating the rule that *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment*).  
- **Contradictory Action**: After a *Loan Decision (Rejected)*, *Finalize Documentation* was performed (violating the rule that *documentation must not be finalized after rejection*).  

**Case 1 and Case 3** comply with all normative rules.  

---

### **2. Cases Failing Desiderata Conditions**  

#### **Case 1**  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**: No *Follow-up Call* was performed before closing the case (a recommended but non-mandatory practice).  

#### **Case 2**  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**: No *Follow-up Call* was performed.  

#### **Case 3**  
- **Delayed Credit Check**: The *Credit Check* occurred **34 hours** after the application was received (violating the recommended 24-hour window).  
- **Delayed Inform Applicant**: The applicant was informed **27 hours** after the loan decision (violating the recommended 48-hour window).  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**: No *Follow-up Call* was performed.  

**Note**: While these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior. For example, delays might indicate inefficiencies, and missing follow-up calls could reduce applicant satisfaction.  

---

### **3. Interpretations or Justifications**  

#### **Case 2 Normative Violations**  
- **Out-of-Order Activities**:  
  - *Possible Cause*: Human error or system misconfiguration allowing activities to proceed out of sequence.  
  - *Justification*: Staff might have mistakenly prioritized *Risk Assessment* due to urgency or misinterpretation of rules.  
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection**:  
  - *Possible Cause*: Process confusion or automation error (e.g., a script automatically finalizing documentation regardless of decision).  
  - *Justification*: None valid under strict rules; this is a clear violation.  

#### **Case 3 Desiderata Failures**  
- **Delayed Credit Check**:  
  - *Possible Cause*: High workload, system downtime, or dependency on external credit bureaus.  
  - *Justification*: Unavoidable delays due to external factors (e.g., holiday backlog).  
- **Delayed Inform Applicant**:  
  - *Possible Cause*: Weekend/holiday delays or internal bottlenecks in communication.  
  - *Justification*: If the delay occurred over a non-working day, it might align with business hours.  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**:  
  - *Possible Cause*: Oversight, time constraints, or low prioritization of non-mandatory steps.  
  - *Justification*: Resource limitations or focus on higher-priority tasks.  

#### **General Justifications for Desiderata Failures**  
- Desiderata are flexible guidelines. For example, a *Follow-up Call* might be skipped if the applicant explicitly declined further communication.  
- Timing deviations (e.g., *Credit Check* delays) could reflect exceptional circumstances (e.g., system outages).

### **Summary Table**  

| **Case** | **Normative Violations** | **Desiderata Failures** |  
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|  
| **1**    | None                       | Missing *Follow-up Call* |  
| **2**    | Out-of-order activities, Finalize Documentation after rejection | Missing *Follow-up Call* |  
| **3**    | None                       | Delayed *Credit Check*, Delayed *Inform Applicant*, Missing *Follow-up Call* |  

This analysis ensures compliance with strict rules while highlighting areas for improvement in adherence to best practices.
