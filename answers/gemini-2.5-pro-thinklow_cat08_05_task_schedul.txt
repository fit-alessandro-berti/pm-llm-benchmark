Excellent. This is a classic and challenging scenario perfectly suited for a sophisticated, data-driven approach. As a Senior Operations Analyst, here is my detailed plan for Precision Parts Inc.

### **Executive Summary**

Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling challenges stem from the high complexity of its operations and reliance on outdated, localized dispatching rules. These rules fail to account for the dynamic, interconnected nature of the shop floor, particularly sequence-dependent setups and resource contention. This proposal outlines a five-stage methodology to transform the company's scheduling capabilities. We will first leverage process mining to create a "digital twin" of the actual production process, providing unprecedented visibility. This allows us to precisely diagnose performance issues and their root causes. Based on these data-driven insights, we will develop and evaluate three advanced scheduling strategies—ranging from enhanced dynamic dispatching to predictive simulation and setup optimization. Finally, we will establish a framework for simulation-based validation and continuous, automated improvement, ensuring the new scheduling system remains effective and adapts to future changes.

### **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

The foundation of any improvement is a deep, quantitative understanding of the current state. The MES event log is the "source of truth." We will use process mining to transform this raw data into actionable intelligence.

**Process Reconstruction:**
First, we will structure the event log by identifying the three core elements required for process mining:
*   **Case ID:** `Case ID (Job ID)`
*   **Activity:** A combination of `Activity/Task` and `Event Type` (e.g., 'Cutting_Start', 'Cutting_End', 'Milling_Queue_Entry'). This requires careful event correlation to link start and end events for the same task.
*   **Timestamp:** `Timestamp`

This allows us to automatically discover and visualize the end-to-end process flow for all jobs, creating a detailed process map that reflects what *actually* happens, not what is supposed to happen.

**Specific Techniques and Metrics:**

*   **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan:**
    *   **Technique:** Cycle Time Analysis. We will calculate the duration between the `Job Released` event and the final `Task End` event for each `Case ID`.
    *   **Metrics:** We will generate histograms and statistical distributions (mean, median, 95th percentile, standard deviation) for the overall job lead time. The makespan (total time to complete a specific set of jobs) can be calculated for daily or weekly batches. This will immediately quantify the unpredictability of lead times.

*   **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
    *   **Technique:** Bottleneck Analysis and Duration Analysis. The time between a `Queue Entry` event and the corresponding `Task Start` or `Setup Start` event is the queue time.
    *   **Metrics:** We will create a dashboard showing the average and maximum waiting time for each `Resource (Machine ID)`. The process map can be animated or color-coded to highlight activities with the longest preceding waiting times, instantly identifying the primary queues.

*   **Resource Utilization:**
    *   **Technique:** Resource-centric Analysis.
    *   **Metrics:** For each `Resource`, we will calculate:
        *   **Productive Time:** Sum of all `Task Duration (Actual)`.
        *   **Setup Time:** Sum of all actual setup durations (from `Setup Start` to `Setup End`).
        *   **Idle Time:** Total calendar time minus (Productive + Setup + Breakdown Time).
        *   **Utilization Rate:** (Productive Time + Setup Time) / (Total Available Time).
        This allows us to distinguish between resources that are true bottlenecks (high utilization) and those that are idle due to starvation.

*   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
    *   **Technique:** Contextual Data Analysis and Attribute Correlation. This is a critical and advanced analysis.
    *   **Method:** For each resource (e.g., `CUT-01`), we will parse the logs to create a transition matrix. We need to identify the job processed *before* `JOB-7001` on `CUT-01` (the log snippet notes `Previous job: JOB-6998`). By grouping jobs based on key properties (e.g., material type, part family, required tooling), we can build a matrix where:
        *   Rows = Previous Job Type
        *   Columns = Current Job Type
        *   Cell Value = Average/Distribution of `Actual Setup Duration` (`Setup End` - `Setup Start`)
    *   **Metric:** A setup time matrix (e.g., `SetupTime[Material_A][Material_B] = 45 min`) that quantifies the time penalty for specific job sequences on each machine.

*   **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
    *   **Technique:** Conformance Checking and KPI Monitoring.
    *   **Metrics:** For each job, we calculate `Tardiness = Job_Completion_Timestamp - Order Due Date`.
        *   **Frequency:** Percentage of jobs with `Tardiness > 0`.
        *   **Magnitude:** Average and distribution of positive `Tardiness` values.
        *   We can create a scatter plot of `Planned Duration` vs. `Actual Duration` to measure planning accuracy.

*   **Impact of Disruptions:**
    *   **Technique:** Filtering and Comparative Variant Analysis.
    *   **Method:**
        1.  **Breakdowns:** We will filter the process map to show only jobs that were active or in a queue for a machine during its `Breakdown` period. We then compare their lead times and tardiness against statistically similar jobs that were not affected.
        2.  **Hot Jobs:** We will isolate all jobs that had a `Priority Change` to "Urgent". We will trace their flow and measure the "ripple effect"—the increase in waiting time for other jobs that were in the same queues and were superseded by the hot job.

### **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

The analysis from step 1 will provide the evidence to diagnose the specific inefficiencies.

*   **Identification of Bottlenecks:**
    *   **Evidence:** The Bottleneck Analysis will clearly show which resources (`MILL-03`, `HEAT-TREAT-01`) have the longest average waiting times. The utilization analysis will confirm if this is due to high workload or other factors. We can quantify this: "The CNC Milling center (MILL-03) is the primary bottleneck, contributing to 45% of the total waiting time for an average job."

*   **Poor Task Prioritization:**
    *   **Evidence:** Using Variant Analysis, we will compare the process flows of on-time vs. late jobs. We can find specific instances where a low-priority job (or a job with a distant due date) was processed on a bottleneck resource while a high-priority, time-critical job was waiting in the same queue. This is a clear failure of the local EDD/FCFS logic.

*   **Suboptimal Sequencing and Excessive Setup Times:**
    *   **Evidence:** Using the setup time matrix from our analysis, we can retrospectively analyze the sequence of jobs on key machines. We can prove, for instance, that "On April 22nd, machine `CUT-01` incurred 3.5 hours of setup time. By re-sequencing the day's jobs based on material similarity, the total setup time could have been reduced to 1.2 hours, freeing up 2.3 hours of capacity."

*   **Resource Starvation:**
    *   **Evidence:** The resource utilization dashboard will show machines (e.g., `GRIND-02`, `INSPECT-01`) with low utilization rates (e.g., <40%). By viewing their position in the process map, we can see they are downstream from a major bottleneck. The data proves they aren't unnecessary; they are being starved of work.

*   **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:**
    *   **Evidence:** By plotting the number of active cases at each work center over time, we can visualize WIP levels. We will likely see that a small scheduling variation at an early stage (e.g., Cutting) creates progressively larger and more chaotic WIP fluctuations at downstream stations like Grinding and Inspection.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

This step connects the "what" (pathologies) to the "why" (root causes).

*   **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:** The current FCFS/EDD rules are the primary cause. They are myopic; they cannot see the sequence-dependent setup cost of picking the "next" job, nor can they see the load status of a downstream machine. Process mining will show high variability in performance even when these rules are followed, proving they are inadequate for this environment's complexity.

*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** The pathologies exist because schedulers and operators make local decisions without a global view. The process mining model provides exactly this missing holistic view, serving as a "control tower" that shows how a decision at one machine impacts the entire system.

*   **Inaccurate Estimations:** By comparing `Task Duration (Planned)` vs. `Task Duration (Actual)` in the log, we can quantify the estimation error. If the actual times have high variance, any schedule based on planned times is destined to fail. Process mining provides the *actual* distributions, which are essential for realistic planning.

*   **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** The current rules completely ignore this. Our analysis will show a strong correlation between certain job sequences and high setup times, which directly translates to lost capacity and longer lead times. This is a root cause that can be directly addressed.

*   **Differentiating Scheduling vs. Capacity Issues:**
    *   **Process mining is key here.** We can use simulation (see step 5) parameterized by our mined data.
    *   **Scenario A (Scheduling Issue):** If we simulate the current workload using an optimized scheduling logic (e.g., one that minimizes setups) and see a dramatic reduction in queues and tardiness while resource utilization remains below 90-95%, the root cause is poor scheduling.
    *   **Scenario B (Capacity Issue):** If even with the most advanced scheduling logic, a specific resource (`MILL-03`) consistently shows utilization >95% and queues continue to grow, it is a true capacity limitation. The data then supports a business case for investment (e.g., a new machine, an extra shift).

### **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

We will propose three complementary strategies that use our process mining insights to directly address the diagnosed pathologies.

#### **Strategy 1: Multi-Factor Dynamic Dispatching (Enhanced Rules)**

*   **Core Logic:** Replace the simple FCFS/EDD rule at each work center with a dynamic, weighted priority score calculated in real-time for every job in the queue. The job with the highest score is processed next.
    `PriorityScore = w1 * (Urgency) + w2 * (Setup_Savings) + w3 * (Critical_Ratio) + w4 * (Downstream_Load)`
*   **Data Usage:**
    *   `Urgency (w1)`: Combines `Order Priority` and a due-date factor.
    *   `Setup_Savings (w2)`: Uses the **sequence-dependent setup matrix** mined from the logs. It calculates the potential setup time saved by picking this job next compared to the average setup time.
    *   `Critical_Ratio (w3)`: (Time Remaining to Due Date) / (Total Remaining Processing Time). This is a classic rule, but our `Total Remaining Processing Time` will be based on the *mean actual processing times* mined from the log, not inaccurate estimates.
    *   `Downstream_Load (w4)`: A real-time check on the queue length of this job's *next* machine. This prevents a bottleneck from feeding a machine that is already starving.
*   **Pathologies Addressed:** Poor task prioritization, excessive setup times (partially), and resource starvation.
*   **Expected Impact:** Reduced tardiness by prioritizing critical jobs, increased throughput at bottlenecks by reducing setup time, and smoother flow by balancing WIP between stations.

#### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling and Risk Alerting**

*   **Core Logic:** This is a forward-looking strategy. Instead of just deciding what to do *now*, it predicts the future state of the shop floor. For every job currently in the system, we run a rapid Monte Carlo simulation using the data mined from the logs.
*   **Data Usage:**
    *   **Task Duration Distributions:** Instead of a single average time, the simulation samples from the *actual historical distribution* of task durations for that specific task/machine combination (mined from the log).
    *   **Breakdown Models:** Uses the `Breakdown` event data to model the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) for each machine, injecting realistic disruptions into the simulation.
    *   **Routing Probabilities:** Uses variant analysis from process mining to model the actual probabilities of different job routings.
*   **Pathologies Addressed:** Unpredictable lead times and ineffective response to disruptions.
*   **Expected Impact:**
    *   **Proactive Alerts:** The system can flag jobs that have a >80% probability of being late *days in advance*, allowing management to intervene early.
    *   **Accurate Quoted Lead Times:** When a new order arrives, it can be simulated to provide a customer with a realistic completion date range (e.g., "We are 90% confident your order will be ready between May 15th and May 17th").
    *   **"What-If" Analysis:** Enables managers to simulate the impact of taking on a new "hot job" to see its effect on all other orders before committing.

#### **Strategy 3: Global Setup Optimization via Intelligent Batching & Sequencing**

*   **Core Logic:** This strategy focuses purely on minimizing setup times at bottleneck machines, treating it as a primary objective. For a given planning horizon (e.g., the next 8 hours), it looks at all jobs waiting for a bottleneck resource and solves for the optimal processing sequence. This is analogous to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), where "cities" are jobs and "distances" are setup times.
*   **Data Usage:** The **sequence-dependent setup matrix** is the core input. The algorithm's objective function is to find the permutation of jobs in the queue that minimizes the sum of the setup times defined in this matrix.
*   **Pathologies Addressed:** Directly targets suboptimal sequencing and excessive setup times, which is a primary cause of lost capacity at bottlenecks.
*   **Expected Impact:** Significant increase in effective capacity and throughput of bottleneck resources without any capital investment. This leads to a direct reduction in overall lead times and WIP. It may occasionally process a less urgent job first if it unlocks a massive setup time saving, which benefits the entire system's throughput.

### **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

Deploying a new scheduling system is risky. We must rigorously test and de-risk it first.

**Discrete-Event Simulation for Evaluation:**
We will build a high-fidelity discrete-event simulation model of the entire job shop in a specialized tool (e.g., AnyLogic, Siemens Plant Simulation). This model will be parameterized with the rich data derived from our process mining analysis:
*   Job arrival patterns.
*   Actual task time distributions (not just averages).
*   The sequence-dependent setup time matrix.
*   Resource schedules, MTBF/MTTR for breakdowns.
*   Probabilistic job routings.

We will then run experiments comparing the following scenarios:
1.  **Baseline:** The current FCFS/EDD rules.
2.  **Strategy 1:** The dynamic dispatching rule.
3.  **Strategy 3:** The setup optimization logic at bottlenecks.
4.  **Hybrid:** A combination of Strategy 1 and 3.

We will test these under various conditions: `Normal Load`, `High Load (peak season)`, and `High Disruption (frequent breakdown simulation)`. The results will be compared on key KPIs (Tardiness, WIP, Lead Time, Throughput), allowing us to objectively select the best strategy and fine-tune its parameters (e.g., the weights in Strategy 1) before it impacts the real shop floor.

**Framework for Continuous Improvement:**
The job shop is not static; new materials, parts, and machines will be introduced. The scheduling system must adapt.
1.  **Automated Monitoring:** The process mining analysis will be automated to run nightly or weekly on the latest MES data.
2.  **KPI Dashboard:** A live dashboard will track the KPIs (tardiness, WIP, etc.) over time.
3.  **Conformance and Drift Detection:** The system will automatically compare the planned schedules against the actual execution data from the MES. It can detect "drift"—for example, if setup times for a certain material combination start increasing, indicating a process change or tool wear.
4.  **Model Re-tuning:** When a significant drift is detected, the system will flag it for an analyst. This triggers a re-analysis and a potential automatic or manual update to the scheduling model's parameters (e.g., updating the setup time matrix, re-calculating task time distributions).

This creates a closed-loop system where the scheduling strategy continuously learns and adapts from the real-world operational data, ensuring sustained performance gains for Precision Parts Inc.
