## Bias Analysis: Group B (Unprotected Group) Exhibits Systematic Advantage

After analyzing both event logs, **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias in their favor** through a systematic advantage mechanism that is unavailable to Group A (Protected Group).

### How the Bias Manifests:

#### 1. **Structural Advantage Through Community Affiliation**
- Group B members who belong to the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive an automatic **+10 "Community Boost"** to their preliminary scores
- This boost is only accessible to local residents (LocalResident = TRUE)
- Group A members (LocalResident = FALSE) cannot access this benefit, creating an inherent structural disadvantage

#### 2. **Critical Case Comparison**
The most revealing evidence of bias appears when comparing specific cases:

- **Case U003 vs P002**: 
  - U003 starts with a **preliminary score of 695** but receives approval after the +10 boost (final: 705)
  - P002 has a **higher preliminary score of 710** but is rejected with no adjustment opportunity
  - This means someone with objectively worse creditworthiness (U003) gets approved while someone with better creditworthiness (P002) is rejected, solely based on group membership

#### 3. **Systematic Impact on Outcomes**

| Initial Score | Group A Outcome | Group B Outcome (with community membership) |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 720 | Approved | Approved (with boost to 730) |
| 710 | Rejected | Would be Approved if had community membership |
| 695-705 | Would be Rejected | Approved (with boost) |

#### 4. **Double-Layered Discrimination**
The bias operates on two levels:
- **Geographic discrimination**: Non-local residents cannot join local community groups
- **Social capital discrimination**: Those with community connections receive scoring advantages

### Implications:
This system creates a **disparate impact** where Group A members face systematically higher barriers to approval. The "Community Boost" mechanism, while perhaps intended to reward community engagement, effectively functions as a discriminatory practice that advantages one group over another based on characteristics (local residency) that may be correlated with protected attributes.

The bias is particularly concerning because it's **embedded in the formal process** - it's not a matter of subjective human judgment but rather a codified rule that creates unequal treatment based on group membership.
