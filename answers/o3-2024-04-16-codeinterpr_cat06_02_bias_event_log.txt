Key observations from the event log

1. Only one variable ever changes the applicants’ “objective” credit score:  
   ScoreAdjustment = “+10 (Community)”.

2. The +10 bonus is granted only when BOTH of these are true:  
   a. LocalResident = TRUE, and  
   b. CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club”.  
   (Case C002 is a local resident but not in the club and receives no bonus.)

3. The 10-point lift is large enough to move applicants across the apparent approval cutoff of 700.

   • C003 (715, no bonus)  Rejected  
   • C004 (690  700 after bonus)  Approved  

   An applicant with the club affiliation was approved with a lower underlying score than an equally (or more) credit-worthy non-affiliated applicant.

Where bias is injected

Step: PreliminaryScoring  
Mechanism: Hard-coded +10 when CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club”.

Step: ManualReview  
Mechanism: The human underwriter “locks in” the same +10 instead of challenging it.  
(ManualReview could be a guardrail, but here it perpetuates the bias.)

Attributes creating the bias

• CommunityGroup – a social-affiliation field that acts as a gate to the bonus.  
• LocalResident – a prerequisite for the bonus that further narrows eligibility.

Why this is problematic

1. Disparate treatment: The system explicitly gives favourable treatment to a subset of applicants based on a non-credit-related characteristic (club membership/local residency). Those outside the club receive no equivalent pathway to the extra points.

2. Disparate impact: If club membership or locality correlates with protected-class status (race, ethnicity, national origin, age, etc.), protected classes will be systematically under-scored and more frequently rejected even when their underlying creditworthiness is equal or better.

3. Threshold distortion: A fixed +10 distorts the risk ranking. Lower-risk applicants without the affiliation (C003) are rejected while higher-risk but affiliated applicants (C004) are approved, undermining portfolio quality as well as fairness.

4. Transparency & contestability: Applicants have no obvious way to know that a community-club field is pivotal, so they cannot contest an adverse action or take steps to meet the hidden criterion.

Implications for those without the affiliation or locality

• They must achieve a higher raw score to clear the approval bar, effectively facing a tougher standard.  
• Even small communities or recent movers (e.g., students, immigrants, lower-income applicants who relocate for work) will be structurally disadvantaged.  
• Over time the approved pool will concentrate affiliated/local residents, reinforcing geographic and social homogeneity and potentially amplifying existing inequalities.

Recommendations to mitigate the bias

1. Remove or neutralise the CommunityGroup bonus unless a rigorous, business-related justification can be shown and defended under fair-lending rules.

2. Stress-test the scoring model for disparate impact using protected-class proxies (e.g., surname analysis, geocoding).

3. Require the ManualReview step to validate (or strip out) any non-credit-related adjustments rather than rubber-stamp them.

4. Adopt “fairness constraints” in the scoring engine that ensure applicants with equivalent credit merit receive equivalent scores regardless of locality or club membership.

5. Provide clear adverse-action notices that list only credit-related reasons, ensuring hidden social variables cannot influence outcomes in ways applicants cannot understand or contest.

In short, the +10 CommunityGroup adjustment skews both individual outcomes and the aggregate approval pattern, favouring a narrowly defined group and disadvantaging equally (or more) creditworthy applicants who lack that affiliation.
