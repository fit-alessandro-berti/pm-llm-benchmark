Based on the provided event log sample, I propose the following high-level activities and their justifications:

1. **Material Preparation**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

   *Justification:* These events are all related to preparing the raw material (metal sheet) for the subsequent processing steps. They are performed by the same resources (Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1) and occur consecutively at the beginning of each case.

2. **Assembly**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B

   *Justification:* These events represent the assembly process of the metal sheet, where the welding tool is used to join the corners. They are performed by the same resource (Operator B) and occur consecutively after the material preparation phase.

3. **Quality Inspection**
   - Measure weld integrity
   - Visual check

   *Justification:* These events are related to quality control and inspection of the assembled product. They involve measuring the weld integrity using a quality sensor and performing a visual check by an operator. These checks occur after the assembly phase to ensure the product meets the required standards.

4. **Surface Treatment**
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating

   *Justification:* These events represent the surface treatment process, where a protective coating is applied to the assembled product and then dried using a heating unit. They occur consecutively after the quality inspection phase.

By grouping the low-level events into these high-level activities, we can better understand the overall manufacturing workflow. The process starts with material preparation, followed by assembly, quality inspection, and surface treatment. This aggregation allows us to view the process at a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to analyze and optimize the manufacturing process.
