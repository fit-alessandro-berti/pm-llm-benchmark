Based on the event log, we can observe the following behavior:

- Every case starts with **Receive Application (RA)**.
- This is followed by **Validate Form (VF)**.
- Then **Assess Eligibility (AE)** is performed.
- **Optionally**, **Request Missing Info (RMI)** may occur (once or multiple times), **always followed by another Validate Form (VF)** before proceeding.
- After this optional loop, the process continues with **Approval Decision (AD)**, **Send Confirmation (SC)**, and **Archive Case (AC)**.

This pattern matches a **loop** structure where:
- The **main body** of the loop is **RMI  VF**
- The loop **exits** to continue with **AD  SC  AC**

Thus, the overall structure is:

```
-> (
    'RA',
    'VF',
    'AE',
    * (
        tau,
        -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' )
    ),
    'AD',
    'SC',
    'AC'
)
```

### Explanation:
- The initial sequence `RA  VF  AE` is always executed.
- Then a **loop** is entered:
  - The loop body is `RMI  VF`
  - The loop allows **zero or more** repetitions (since in Case 2, RMI never occurs)
  - The `tau` (silent step) as the first child of the loop operator `*` represents the **exit condition** (i.e., you can exit the loop immediately without executing the body)
- After exiting the loop, the process continues with the final sequence `AD  SC  AC`.

### Final Process Tree (in process tree syntax):

```
-> (
    'RA',
    'VF',
    'AE',
    * ( tau, -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ),
    'AD',
    'SC',
    'AC'
)
```
