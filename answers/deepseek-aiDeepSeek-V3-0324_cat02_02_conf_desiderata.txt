### **Analysis of the Event Log**

#### **1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Constraints)**

**Case 1:**  
- **Sequence:** Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
- **Assessment:** No violations. The process strictly follows the normative sequence and decision logic.  

**Case 2:**  
- **Sequence:**  
  - Application Received  
  → **Risk Assessment (before Credit Check - violates ordering rule)**  
  → Credit Check  
  → Loan Decision (Rejected)  
  → **Finalize Documentation (not allowed after rejection - violates decision logic)**  
  → Close Case  
- **Violations:**  
  1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** (violates the rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment).  
  2. **Finalize Documentation after rejection** (violates the rule that rejected cases should close without finalization).  

**Case 3:**  
- **Sequence:** Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
- **Assessment:** No normative violations. The order is correct, and the approved loan follows the required steps (finalization before closing).

#### **2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended but Not Strict)**  

**Case 1:**  
- **Desiderata Check:**  
  - Credit Check was done within **30 minutes** of application (well within 24 hours).  
  - Applicant was informed **2 hours** after the decision (well within 48 hours).  
  - No Follow-up Call was performed (but this is only a recommendation).  
- **Assessment:** No desiderata violations (timings are good, follow-up call is optional).  

**Case 2:**  
- **Desiderata Check:**  
  - Credit Check was done **20 minutes** after application (within 24 hours).  
  - Applicant was informed **30 minutes** after rejection (within 48 hours).  
  - No Follow-up Call was performed (but this is optional).  
- **Assessment:** No desiderata violations (timings are fine).  

**Case 3:**  
- **Desiderata Check:**  
  - **Credit Check was done ~48 hours after application** (violates the recommendation of completing it within 24 hours).  
  - **Applicant was informed ~51 hours after decision** (violates the recommendation of informing within 48 hours).  
  - **No Follow-up Call** (not a strict violation, but suboptimal).  
- **Assessment:**  
  - **Two desiderata violations** (delayed Credit Check and delayed Inform Applicant).  
  - Follow-up call was skipped (not a strict issue).

#### **3. Possible Justifications for Observed Behaviors**  

**Case 2 (Normative Violations):**  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**  
  - Possible human error (e.g., an employee skipped the Credit Check initially and had to backtrack).  
  - System error (e.g., Risk Assessment was mistakenly triggered early).  
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**  
  - Could be a clerical mistake (e.g., the employee started finalization before the decision was fully processed).  
  - May indicate a flaw in the workflow system (e.g., it allowed documentation even for rejections).  

**Case 3 (Desiderata Violations):**  
- **Delayed Credit Check and Notification:**  
  - Possible backlog in processing (e.g., high volume of applications).  
  - Manual handling delays (e.g., staff shortages or prioritization of other cases).  
- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  - May not be enforced due to resource constraints.  
  - Could be an intentional choice (e.g., not needed for approved cases).

### **Final Summary**  

| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? |  
|------|----------------------|------------------------|  
| **1** | **No** | **No** (Follow-up call missing, but optional) |  
| **2** | **Yes** (Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize after Rejection) | **No** |  
| **3** | **No** | **Yes** (Credit Check >24h; Inform Applicant >48h) |  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Case 2** is the most problematic due to **normative violations** (strict rules broken).  
- **Case 3** is non-compliant with **best practices** but does not break hard rules.  
- **Case 1** is fully compliant with both normative and desiderata expectations.  

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
- For **Case 2**, enforce **mandatory Credit Check before Risk Assessment** in the system.  
- For **Case 3**, investigate why delays occurred (e.g., workload, inefficiencies).  
- Consider automating reminders for **Follow-up Calls** to improve adherence to desiderata.
