The diagram presents a workflow process involving multiple activities and decision points, depicted using rectangles with rounded corners and connected by arrows indicating the flow of actions. The process begins with the activity 'register request (6)' followed by 'check ticket (9)', leading to a decision point labeled 'decide (9)'. From this decision point, several paths branch out to different activities such as 'examine thoroughly (3)', 'reject request (3)', 'pay compensation (3)', 'reinitiate request (3)', and 'examine casually (6)'. Each path is annotated with numbers indicating the frequency or weight of occurrences. The diagram illustrates a sequence of actions and decisions, showing how a request is processed, evaluated, and resolved through various steps, ultimately leading to different outcomes based on the decision made at the 'decide (9)' point. The overall concept conveys a structured approach to handling requests, emphasizing the importance of decision-making in determining the subsequent actions and their outcomes.
