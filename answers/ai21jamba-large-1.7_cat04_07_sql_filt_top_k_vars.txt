Here's the SQL query for the DuckDB benchmark task:

```sql
-- Step 1: Construct the sequence of activities per `case_id`
WITH OrderedActivities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),

-- Step 2: Group by activity sequences to find process variants
VariantCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM 
        OrderedActivities
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
    ORDER BY 
        variant_count DESC
    LIMIT K  -- Top K variants
),

-- Step 3: Filter the original event log to include only cases belonging to the top K variants
FilteredEvents AS (
    SELECT 
        el.*
    FROM 
        event_log AS el
    INNER JOIN 
        OrderedActivities AS oa
    ON 
        el.case_id = oa.case_id
    INNER JOIN 
        VariantCounts AS vc
    ON 
        oa.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
)

-- Final result
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    FilteredEvents
ORDER BY 
    case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Step 1**: Extract ordered activity sequences for each `case_id` using `STRING_AGG` combined with `ORDER BY timestamp`.
2. **Step 2**: Group by the aggregated activity sequence to determine unique process variants and count the number of cases per variant. The `LIMIT K` filters for the top K variants.
3. **Step 3**: Filter events from the original `event_log` table to include only those from cases that correspond to the top K variants using a combination of `INNER JOIN`.
4. **Final Result**: Output all the filtered events, ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp`.

Replace `K` with the desired number of top variants you wish to analyze.
