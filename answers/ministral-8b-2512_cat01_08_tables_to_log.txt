### **Key Assumptions and Notes**:
1. **Missing Data Handling**:
   - Order `1004` lacks delivery/invoice/payment records. If this is intentional (e.g., canceled order), it should be documented. Otherwise, assume data gaps.
   - For **multiple invoices per order** (e.g., `1002`), each invoice is treated as a separate event with its own timestamp and payment.

2. **Activity Naming**:
   - "Items Picked" is split per `item_id` to reflect granularity (though process mining may aggregate these if needed).
   - "Order Dispatched/Arrived" is tied to `delivery_id` for traceability.

3. **Resource Mapping**:
   - Used the `Resources` table to resolve IDs (e.g., `WH-001`  `David Lin`).

4. **Chronological Order**:
   - Events are sorted by timestamp. For orders with no delivery (e.g., `1004`), the log reflects missing steps.

5. **Optional Attributes**:
   - Added `customer_type`, `priority`, and `quantity` where relevant for context.
