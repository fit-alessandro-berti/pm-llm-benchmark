Here’s a list of open-ended questions designed to uncover gaps, clarify roles and decisions, and surface exception-handling in your property-onboarding workflow:

1. Can you walk me through each stakeholder’s responsibilities (coordinator, property manager, inspector, compliance officer, financial analyst, IT) at every major phase of onboarding?  
2. What specific criteria and weighting do you use when selecting which property manager to assign?  
3. How long does each step typically take—from initial document review to final activation—and where do you see the biggest bottlenecks?  
4. How do you track and escalate situations when landlords repeatedly submit incomplete or outdated documentation?  
5. What triggers the hand-off from the property coordinator to the property manager, and how is that transition documented?  
6. During the introductory meeting, how do you capture and record special landlord requirements or custom lease clauses?  
7. What are the most common inspection failures, and how do you decide when to hire contractors versus asking landlords to manage repairs?  
8. How do you keep your pricing models aligned with market trends—what data sources and review cadence drive your rent recommendations?  
9. Can you describe the process and decision points when multiple tenant applicants compete for the same unit?  
10. What rules or guidelines govern promotional discounts or lease-length incentives?  
11. How do you handle exceptions like furnished rentals, pet-friendly units, or properties requiring specialized insurance?  
12. Which internal tools (CRM, project manager, document repository) do you use at each step, and how are communications and approvals routed through them?  
13. How and when does your compliance officer intervene to review leases, and what happens if a lease fails that review?  
14. What financial controls ensure the agreed rental price meets profitability targets before lease signing?  
15. How does the IT team verify data integrity for new properties, and what happens if discrepancies are found post-activation?  
16. What metrics or KPIs do you monitor to evaluate the health of the onboarding pipeline?  
17. How do you manage urgent or fast-track onboarding requests (e.g., high-value luxury units)?  
18. In what scenarios would you loop in a regional manager or executive for approval during onboarding?  
19. How do you capture and learn from audit findings or post-mortems when an onboarding project encounters delays or compliance issues?  
20. If a landlord requests changes after activation (e.g., adjust pet policy, alter lease terms), how is that change process governed and tracked?  

These questions should help us drill into your decision criteria, roles, timing, exception-handling, and the systems that underpin the workflow.
