 To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to compare the process variants and their performance metrics. Here are some key differences based on the provided data:

1. **Frequency and Performance of Common Pathways:**
   - The pathway "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" is common in both groups but has a much higher frequency in the unprotected group (1466) compared to the protected group (73). The performance is similar, suggesting that this pathway is more frequently utilized by the unprotected group.
   - Similarly, "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" is also common and more frequent in the unprotected group (1418) compared to the protected group (78).

2. **Access to Expert and Thorough Examinations:**
   - The unprotected group seems to have more access to "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination" steps, as indicated by the higher frequencies of these pathways. This could suggest a disparity in the level of initial care provided.

3. **Treatment Success and Re-treatment:**
   - There are more instances of unsuccessful treatment followed by re-treatment in the unprotected group, as seen in the pathways involving "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge." This could indicate that the unprotected group is receiving more persistent and thorough care even after initial treatment failure.

4. **Discharge Without Treatment:**
   - The protected group has instances of "Register at ER" and "Register at FD" without subsequent treatment steps, indicated by a performance of 0.000. This could suggest that some individuals in the protected group are being registered but not receiving treatment, which is not observed in the unprotected group.

5. **Average Treatment Duration:**
   - The performance times (which represent the average duration of each pathway) are generally longer for the unprotected group, especially in pathways involving re-treatment due to unsuccessful initial treatment. This could imply that the unprotected group is experiencing longer
