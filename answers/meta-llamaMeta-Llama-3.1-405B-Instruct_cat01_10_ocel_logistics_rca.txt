Based on the provided directly follows graph, I've identified some potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

1. **High duration between "place order" and "confirm order"**: In the "orders" object type, the duration between "place order" and "confirm order" is relatively high (104218.54 units). This might indicate a bottleneck in the order confirmation process.
2. **Frequent reordering**: In the "items" object type, the frequency of "item out of stock" and "reorder item" is relatively high (1078 and 869, respectively). This could indicate issues with inventory management, leading to frequent reordering and potential delays.
3. **Long duration between "pay order" and "pick item"**: In the "items" object type, the duration between "pay order" and "pick item" is relatively high (429073.36 units). This might indicate a delay in processing payments or picking items after payment.
4. **High frequency of "pick item" loops**: In the "employees" object type, there is a high frequency of "pick item" loops (4545 events). This could indicate inefficiencies in the picking process or inadequate inventory management.
5. **Long duration between "create package" and "send package"**: In the "packages" object type, the duration between "create package" and "send package" is relatively high (68577.23 units). This might indicate a delay in packaging or shipping processes.
6. **Frequent payment reminders**: In the "items" object type, the frequency of "package delivered" and "payment reminder" is relatively high (859 events). This could indicate issues with payment processing or customer payment behavior.
7. **Complexity in the "products" object type**: The "products" object type has a large number of edges and high-frequency events, which might indicate complexity in the product management process. This could lead to performance issues or inefficiencies.

These potential root causes should be further investigated and analyzed to determine the actual impact on the process performance.
