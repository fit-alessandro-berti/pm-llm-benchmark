**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

**Activities/Tasks:**

1. **Receive Invoice**: Accounts Payable receives an invoice by email.
2. **Verify PO**: Check if the invoice is associated with a valid purchase order (PO) number.
	* **Gate out**: If no PO number, send to supplier for details and go back to **Receive Invoice**.
3. **Log Invoice**: If PO exists, log the invoice into the accounting system.
4. **Confirm Receipt**: Forward the logged invoice to the purchasing department for confirmation of goods or services receipt.
5. **Match Invoice**: Match the invoice line items against the PO in the system.
	* **Gateway Condition**: If discrepancies are found, send to Purchasing for resolution.
6. **Purchasing Resolution**: Purchasing team resolves discrepancies with the supplier.
7. **Manager’s Approval**: Manager approves the invoice after system confirmation and Purchasing’s resolution.
8. **Scheduling Payment**: Schedule the invoice for payment after manager’s approval.

**Sequence Flow:**

1. **Receive Invoice** -> **Verify PO** [unless PO missing]
2. **Verify PO** -> **Log Invoice** [if PO exists]
3. **Log Invoice** -> **Confirm Receipt** [move forward]
4. **Confirm Receipt** -> **Match Invoice** [move forward]
5. **Match Invoice** -> **Manager’s Approval** [if discrepancies resolved]
6. **Purchasing Resolution** -> **Match Invoice** [if discrepancies resolved]
7. **Manager’s Approval** -> **Scheduling Payment** [move forward]

**Gateways/Decision Points:**

1. **PO Missing**: If invoice lacks a PO number, go back to **Receive Invoice** and query supplier for details.
2. **Discrepancies Found**: If invoice does not match PO, go to **Purchasing Resolution**.

**Roles/Participants:**

1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**: Receives, logs, verifies PO, and schedules for payment under normal circumstances.
2. **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Confirms receipt and resolves discrepancies with supplier.
3. **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Approves invoices once discrepancies are resolved.
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**: Resolves issues not dealt with by standard process, including invoices without POs.
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**: Assists in resolving issues related to supplier information or alterations to invoices.

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**

1. **Invoices**: Electronically received invoices from suppliers.
2. **Purchase Orders (POs)**: Supporting documentation for approved purchases.
3. **Accounting System**: Platforms used to log, match, and schedule invoices for payment.
4. **Confirmation Emails**: Automated emails sent between departments for confirming receipt, discrepancies, and approvals.
5. **PO Numbers**: Unique identifiers required for billing purchases.
6. **Product/Service Receipt Notes**: Records of verification of goods or services receipts.

**Exceptions/Variations:**

1. **PO Missing**: Invoice lacks a valid purchase order number.
2. **Discrepancies**: Invoice does not match the purchase order or contains pricing issues.
3. **Informal Service Agreements**: In cases where the service was contracted without an official purchase order, AP consults with department heads to determine handling.
4. **Supplier Errors**: Inefficiencies or errors with the supplier’s invoicing process.

This process model is a clear representation of how different stakeholders in the organization perceive and execute the invoice approval process, including the activities involved, the sequence of these activities, and the decision points or gateways.
