### **Analysis and Labeling of Manufacturing Activities**

Based on the event log, we can identify distinct phases by observing patterns in sensor readings (temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption). Here’s how I grouped and labeled the events:

---

### **1. Idle / Standby (Events 1-3, 13-15)**
- **Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Low temperature (~20°C)  
  - Minimal pressure (1 bar)  
  - No vibration (0 Hz)  
  - No material flow (0 units/s)  
  - Tool position at 0 mm (default/resting position)  
  - Low energy consumption (~0.4–0.5 kWh)  
- **Rationale:**  
  - The machine is inactive, likely in a standby or warm-up state before/after operations.  
  - No significant sensor activity suggests no active manufacturing process.

### **2. Cutting / Machining (Events 4-6)**
- **Events:** 4, 5, 6  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Rising temperature (50°C → 58°C)  
  - Slight pressure increase (1 → 1.5 bar)  
  - High vibration (30–38 Hz)  
  - Moderate material flow (5 units/s)  
  - Tool position gradually increasing (5 → 10 mm)  
  - High energy usage (2–3 kWh)  
- **Rationale:**  
  - High vibration and rising temperature suggest mechanical cutting or grinding.  
  - Tool movement and material flow indicate active material removal.  
  - Energy spikes align with power-intensive cutting operations.

### **3. Assembly / Positioning (Events 7-8)**
- **Events:** 7, 8  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Temperature drops (40°C, stable)  
  - Pressure increases slightly (2 bar)  
  - Lower vibration (10 Hz)  
  - Reduced material flow (2 units/s)  
  - Tool position fixed at 15 mm  
  - Moderate energy (2 kWh)  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Stable conditions with moderate energy suggest assembly or part positioning.  
  - Lower vibration indicates no heavy machining, possibly aligning or fastening parts.  
  - Material flow could represent feeding components into place.

### **4. Welding / Joining (Event 9)**
- **Event:** 9  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Sharp temperature spike (80°C)  
  - Pressure stable (2 bar)  
  - Very high vibration (50 Hz)  
  - No material flow (0 units/s)  
  - Tool position unchanged (15 mm)  
  - Highest energy usage (5 kWh)  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Extreme temperature and vibration suggest a high-energy joining process (e.g., welding).  
  - No material flow implies no cutting or feeding, just fusion.  
  - Energy spike matches welding equipment demands.

### **5. Cooling / Post-Processing (Event 10)**
- **Event:** 10  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Temperature drops sharply (30°C)  
  - Pressure returns to baseline (1 bar)  
  - Minimal vibration (1 Hz)  
  - No material flow (0 units/s)  
  - Tool position unchanged (15 mm)  
  - Lower energy (1 kWh)  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Rapid cooldown after welding suggests a quenching or cooling phase.  
  - Minimal activity indicates a pause before the next step.

### **6. Quality Inspection / Finishing (Events 11-12)**
- **Events:** 11, 12  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Low temperature (25°C)  
  - Baseline pressure (1 bar)  
  - Slight vibration (5 Hz)  
  - Minimal material flow (1 unit/s)  
  - Tool position moves slightly (20 mm)  
  - Low energy (~1.5 kWh)  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Gentle tool movement and low energy suggest non-destructive testing or finishing.  
  - Could involve measuring, polishing, or inspecting the workpiece.

### **Summary of Inferred Process Flow:**
1. **Idle** (Events 1-3)  
2. **Cutting/Machining** (Events 4-6)  
3. **Assembly/Positioning** (Events 7-8)  
4. **Welding/Joining** (Event 9)  
5. **Cooling** (Event 10)  
6. **Quality Inspection/Finishing** (Events 11-12)  
7. **Idle** (Events 13-15)  

### **Key Insights:**
- The process starts and ends in an **Idle** state.  
- The main operations (**Cutting → Assembly → Welding → Inspection**) follow a logical manufacturing sequence.  
- Sensor spikes (temperature, vibration, energy) clearly differentiate high-intensity phases (cutting, welding) from lower-intensity ones (assembly, inspection).  

This approach demonstrates how raw sensor data can be mapped to meaningful manufacturing activities using process mining techniques.
