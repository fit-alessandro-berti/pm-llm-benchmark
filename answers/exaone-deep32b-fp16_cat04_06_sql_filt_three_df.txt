Okay, let's tackle this DuckDB SQL problem step by step. The goal is to write a query that first identifies certain case_ids based on a specific activity sequence and a time condition, then excludes those cases from the final result. The final output should be all events except those from the excluded cases. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the problem has three main parts. The first part is finding cases where the three activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' occur in direct succession. Then, among those cases, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Then, exclude those cases entirely from the final result. So the final query should return all events not in those excluded cases.

Starting with part 1: identifying the cases with the exact sequence. Since the activities need to be in direct succession with no other events in between, I need to look for three consecutive rows in the same case_id where the activities are in that exact order. 

How to do that in SQL? Maybe using window functions to assign row numbers partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp. Then, check if three consecutive rows have the right activities. Alternatively, perhaps using a self-join where for each 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event, there's a 'Create Order' event immediately after, and then a 'Confirm Order' after that. But ensuring they are consecutive might be tricky.

Alternatively, for each case, order the events by timestamp, then look for sequences where three consecutive rows match the activities in order. To do this, maybe using a CTE (Common Table Expression) where we assign a row number partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp. Then, for each row, check if the current row's activity is the first in the sequence, and the next row is the second, and the next next is the third. But how to get the next rows?

Wait, perhaps using the LEAD function. Let me think. For each row in the event_log, we can look ahead to the next two rows. So for each row, if the current activity is 'Approve...', then the next row's activity should be 'Create Order', and the one after that should be 'Confirm Order'. But we need to make sure that those next rows exist and are consecutive. 

Alternatively, using a window function with LEAD(2) to get the activity two rows ahead. Let's see:

Let me structure this. Let's first create a CTE that for each event, has the next two activities. For example:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp), 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity
    FROM event_log
),
Then, perhaps find rows where the current activity is 'Approve...', and the next is 'Create Order', and the next_next is 'Confirm Order'. But that would capture the first of the three. Wait, but the 'Approve' is the first, so the next two should be the next two activities. So the 'Approve' row would have next_activity as 'Create Order' and next_next_activity as 'Confirm Order'. So in that case, the current row (the Approve one) would be part of such a triplet. Then, the case_id of that row would be part of the cases that have the sequence. But we need to collect all case_ids that have at least one such triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the triplet can be found by checking for three consecutive rows in order. So for each case, after ordering by timestamp, check if there exists three consecutive rows with the activities in order. 

Another approach: For each case, generate a sequence of rows ordered by timestamp, then look for any trio where the first is Approve, second Create, third Confirm. To do this, perhaps using a window function to assign row numbers per case, then check for rows where the row number is n, n+1, n+2. But how to find that?

Alternatively, using a CTE where for each case, we have the events ordered, and then for each event, check if the next two events are the required. Let's try this:

First, create a CTE that orders the events by case_id and timestamp. Then, for each event, we can check if the current event is the first in the triplet. So:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
Then, for each case, the triplet would be when rn is x, x+1, x+2 where the activities are in order. So for each row where activity is 'Approve...', check if the next row (rn+1) has 'Create Order', and the next next (rn+2) has 'Confirm Order'. 

But how to get the next rows' activities? Maybe using LEAD functions again. Let's see:

In the ordered_events CTE, perhaps adding LEAD(activity, 1) as next_activity, and LEAD(activity,2) as next_next_activity. Then, for a row where activity is 'Approve...', if next_activity is 'Create Order' and next_next_activity is 'Confirm Order', then that row is part of a valid triplet. Then, the case_id of that row is part of the cases that have the sequence. 

So the first part would be to find all case_ids where such a triplet exists. So the CTE could be:

WITH activity_sequence AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        CASE 
            WHEN 
                activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
                AND LEAD(activity, 1, 'Create Order') = 'Create Order' 
                AND LEAD(activity, 2, 'Confirm Order') = 'Confirm Order' 
            THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END AS has_sequence
    FROM event_log
    WHERE 
        -- Maybe need to ensure that the LEADs exist? Because if there are not enough rows, LEAD would return NULL.
        -- So perhaps the condition should check that the next two activities are exactly those.
        -- So the LEAD functions would return the next activity, so for the third step, the third LEAD would be the third activity.
        -- Wait, perhaps the LEAD(activity,1) gives the next activity, and LEAD(activity,2) gives the one after that. 

        -- So the condition would be:
        -- current activity is 'Approve...', 
        -- LEAD(activity,1) over ... is 'Create Order', 
        -- LEAD(activity,2) over ... is 'Confirm Order'
        -- But in the WHERE clause, perhaps not. Wait, the LEAD functions are in the SELECT, so maybe the CASE is checking those conditions.

        -- Alternatively, perhaps the CASE is written as:

        ( 
            activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
            AND LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order' 
            AND LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order' 
        )
    GROUP BY case_id, ... ?

Hmm, maybe the LEAD approach is better. Let me structure this properly.

Let me create a CTE that for each row, checks if it is the start of the triplet. So:

WITH seq_check AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        -- Check if the current row is the first in the triplet
        CASE 
            WHEN 
                activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
                AND LEAD(activity, 1, 'Create Order') OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order' 
                AND LEAD(activity, 2, 'Confirm Order') OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order'
            THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
        END AS is_part_of_sequence
    FROM event_log
)
Wait, but the LEAD function with an offset of 1 would get the next row's activity. So for the current row (Approve), the next row (offset 1) must be Create, and the next next (offset 2) must be Confirm. So the condition would be correct here. However, the LEAD function with offset 2 would get the activity two rows ahead. So the CASE condition would check that. 

But in this case, the 'is_part_of_sequence' would be 1 for the Approve row, but the next two rows (Create and Confirm) would not have that. But we just need to know if the case has at least one such triplet. So perhaps we can select the distinct case_id from this CTE where is_part_of_sequence is 1. 

So the first part would be to get all case_ids where there exists at least one triplet. So:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id 
FROM seq_check 
WHERE is_part_of_sequence = 1 

But perhaps the CTE can be written as:

WITH seq_check AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act
    FROM event_log
),
Then, the cases with the sequence are those where there exists a row where activity is 'Approve...', next_act is 'Create Order', and next_next_act is 'Confirm Order'. 

So the first CTE can be:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM seq_check
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
        AND next_act = 'Create Order' 
        AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
    ) AS cases_with_sequence;

That's the first part. Now, the second condition is that the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence must be more than 5 days. 

Wait, the 'Create Order' is the second activity in the triplet, and 'Confirm Order' is the third. So their timestamps are the next row's timestamp and the next next row's timestamp. 

In the seq_check CTE, for the row that is the 'Approve' event, the next_act's timestamp would be the 'Create Order's timestamp, and the next_next_act's timestamp is the 'Confirm Order's timestamp. 

Wait, but in the current setup, the LEAD functions only give the activity, not the timestamp. So perhaps we need to also get the timestamps of the next events. 

Hmm, right. To calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' (which is the next row after Approve) and the 'Confirm Order' (the next next row), we need their timestamps. 

So modifying the CTE to include the timestamps of the next steps:

WITH seq_check AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act
    FROM event_log
),
Then, for the rows where activity is 'Approve...', and next_act is 'Create Order', and next_next_act is 'Confirm Order', we can compute the time between create_timestamp and confirm_timestamp. 

The time difference is confirm_timestamp - create_timestamp. We need that to be more than 5 days. 

So the cases that meet both conditions (the sequence exists and the time difference is >5 days) would be those where:

activity = 'Approve...' 
AND next_act = 'Create Order' 
AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order' 
AND (confirm_timestamp - create_timestamp) > interval '5 days'

Wait, but how to compute the interval in DuckDB? The timestamp difference can be calculated as (confirm_timestamp - create_timestamp) and then check if it's > 5 days. 

In DuckDB, the syntax for interval might be using INTERVAL '5 DAYS'. So the condition would be:

(confirm_timestamp - create_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 DAYS'

But need to make sure that the data types are correct. 

So putting this together, the CTE for the cases that have the sequence and the time condition would be:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM seq_check
WHERE 
    activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
    AND next_act = 'Create Order' 
    AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order' 
    AND (confirm_timestamp - create_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 DAYS'

Let me call this CTE as excluded_cases. 

Once we have the list of case_ids that need to be excluded, the final step is to return all events from event_log except those where case_id is in excluded_cases. 

So the final query would be:

SELECT * FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM excluded_cases)

Putting all together:

WITH seq_check AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act
    FROM event_log
),
excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM seq_check
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
        AND next_act = 'Create Order' 
        AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order' 
        AND (confirm_timestamp - create_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 DAYS'
)
SELECT * FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
ORDER BY ... ? 

Wait, the problem says "ensure proper grouping, ordering, and filtering". The final result should return all events except those from excluded cases. The ORDER BY isn't specified, but perhaps the user expects the events to be ordered in some way, maybe by case_id and timestamp. But the problem statement says "the result set consists solely of events from the cases that are not filtered out". So maybe the order isn't critical, but perhaps the original order is preserved. However, in DuckDB, when you select from the table without an ORDER BY, it's unordered. But the problem might expect the events to be ordered as per the original table, but perhaps the user just wants the filtering correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the events to be ordered by case_id and timestamp. Let me check the problem statement again. The third part says "exclude them from your final result. You should only return events from cases that do not meet the above criteria. Please ensure proper grouping, ordering, and filtering so that the result set consists solely of events from the cases that are not filtered out."

Hmm, perhaps the ordering is not specified, but to make it deterministic, maybe order by case_id and timestamp. But the problem may not require a specific order. The main thing is the filtering is correct.

Now, possible edge cases: 

- What if a case has multiple such triplets? For example, multiple sequences that meet the criteria. But the excluded_cases is selecting DISTINCT case_id, so even if there are multiple triplets in a case, the case is excluded once.

- Also, the LEAD functions may have NULLs if there are not enough rows. For example, if the Approve event is the last in the case's events, then create_timestamp and confirm_timestamp would be NULL, so those rows would not be included in the excluded_cases. That's correct.

Another thing: the sequence must be three activities in direct succession. So between the Approve and Create, there can't be any other events. The LEAD approach ensures that the next two events are exactly the next ones in the ordered list, so that's correct.

Now, putting all together, the query would be:

WITH seq_check AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp AS approve_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act
    FROM event_log
),
excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM seq_check
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
        AND next_act = 'Create Order' 
        AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order' 
        AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5 DAYS'
)
SELECT * FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

Wait, but in the WHERE clause of excluded_cases, the confirm_ts and create_ts must be non-null. Because if the Approve is the last event, then create_ts would be null, so the condition would not be met. So that's okay.

Another possible issue: the LEAD(activity, 1) must be 'Create Order' and LEAD(activity,2) must be 'Confirm Order'. So the next_act and next_next_act must exactly match those strings. So the conditions are correct.

Testing this logic with sample data:

Suppose a case has events in order:

Approve at time T, then Create at T+1, Confirm at T+6 days. Then the time difference is 5 days (since T+6 - T+1 is 5 days?), wait, let's see:

Wait, create_ts is the timestamp of the Create Order (the next row after Approve), and confirm_ts is the timestamp of Confirm (the next next row). So the difference between confirm_ts and create_ts is (T+6) - (T+1) = 5 days. So that's exactly 5 days. The condition is more than 5 days, so this would not be included. So to have more than 5 days, the confirm must be at T+7, for example.

Another example: Approve at day 0, Create at day 1, Confirm at day 7. Then the difference is 6 days, so that would be included in excluded_cases.

Now, the final SELECT returns all events not in those cases. So that's correct.

Another possible mistake: the LEAD(activity, 1) gives the next activity. So for the Approve row, the next_act is the next activity (Create), and next_next_act is the one after that (Confirm). So the conditions are correct.

I think this should work. Now, the final query should be written as such. Let me check the syntax again. 

Wait, in DuckDB, the INTERVAL syntax is supported? Let me confirm. DuckDB uses the standard SQL INTERVAL keyword. So INTERVAL '5 DAYS' should be okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the time difference can be calculated as (confirm_ts - create_ts) > 5. But since the timestamps are datetime, subtracting gives days? Or the difference in days. Wait, in DuckDB, the result of TIMESTAMP - TIMESTAMP is an INTERVAL. So comparing to INTERVAL '5 DAYS' is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps (confirm_ts - create_ts) > 5 would work if the difference is in days. But to be precise, using INTERVAL is better.

Another thing: the ORDER BY in the final SELECT. The problem says "proper ordering", so perhaps the user expects the events to be ordered by their original timestamp and case_id. Adding ORDER BY case_id, timestamp would make sense. 

So the final query would include that ORDER BY clause. 

Putting all together, here's the SQL:

WITH seq_check AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp AS approve_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act
    FROM event_log
),
excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM seq_check
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
        AND next_act = 'Create Order' 
        AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order' 
        AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5 DAYS'
)
SELECT 
    case_id, 
    activity, 
    timestamp 
FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

Wait, but the original table has more columns (like the three listed: case_id, activity, timestamp). The SELECT * would include all columns, but the problem says "return all events from event_log except those...", so using SELECT * is okay. However, perhaps the user expects explicit columns, but the problem says "return all events", so SELECT * is acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the columns to be listed, but the prompt says "your final query should return all events from event_log except...", so SELECT * is correct. 

But in the sample code above, I wrote SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp. But perhaps better to use SELECT * to include all columns. Let me adjust that.

So the final query would be:

WITH ... (same as before)

SELECT * FROM event_log 
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

Yes. That should do it.

Another possible optimization: the excluded_cases CTE could be written with a subquery that directly checks the conditions. Alternatively, perhaps using a GROUP BY, but the current approach seems okay.

Testing edge case where a case has the sequence but the time is exactly 5 days: it should not be excluded. Only when it's more than 5 days.

Another edge case: a case has the sequence but the time is 5 days and 1 second. Then the interval would be 5 days and 1 second, which is more than 5 days, so excluded.

I think this should handle all cases.
</thought>

Here is the DuckDB SQL query that meets the specified requirements:

```sql
WITH sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp AS approve_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act
    FROM event_log
),
excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence_check
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_act = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5 DAYS'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation:
1. **CTE `sequence_check`**:
   - Uses `LEAD` window functions to fetch the timestamps and activities of the next two events for each row, partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`.
   - Captures the current event's timestamp as `approve_ts`, the next event's timestamp as `create_ts`, and the second next as `confirm_ts`.
   - Also retrieves the activities of the next two events (`next_act` and `next_next_act`).

2. **CTE `excluded_cases`**:
   - Identifies `case_id`s where the sequence "Approve Purchase Requisition"  "Create Order"  "Confirm Order" occurs consecutively.
   - Filters cases where the time between "Create Order" (`create_ts`) and "Confirm Order" (`confirm_ts`) exceeds 5 days using interval comparison.

3. **Final Query**:
   - Selects all columns from `event_log` but excludes rows where `case_id` is in `excluded_cases`.
   - Orders results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for consistency.

This ensures only events from cases that **do not** meet the sequence and timing criteria are returned.
