As a Process Mining Consultant specializing in logistics, the objective is to transform Speedy Parcels’ raw operational data into actionable insights that directly address late deliveries and rising costs. The following comprehensive approach leverages the integrated event log to model, analyze, diagnose, and optimize the last-mile delivery process.

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

The effectiveness of process mining hinges on constructing a unified, high-fidelity event log that captures the temporal sequence of actions across all data silos.

### Data Preprocessing and Integration Challenges

To create the cohesive event log, we must normalize data formats and establish clear traceability:

**A. Defining the Event Log Structure:**
The core structure requires the mandatory fields (Case ID, Activity, Timestamp) and supplementary attributes derived from the sources:

| Field | Source Mapping | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Case ID** | Vehicle ID + Date (`V12-20241205`) | Used for overall daily operational analysis (shift length, utilization). **A secondary Case ID (Package ID)** nested within the daily case is necessary to track the end-to-end sequence for a single delivery. |
| **Activity** | Scanner Event Type, Dispatch Status, GPS Event Type | Standardized actions (e.g., 'Depart Depot', 'Arrive Customer P9876', 'Service Interrupted - Maintenance'). |
| **Timestamp** | All Sources | Precisely aligned timestamps are crucial. |
| **Resource** | Driver ID (D105), Vehicle ID (V12) | Allows segmentation based on personnel and assets. |
| **Attributes** | Location (Lat/Lon), Speed, Package ID, Planned Stop Sequence (from Dispatch) | Used for dimensional analysis and conformance checking. |

**B. Integration Challenges:**

1.  **Granularity Mismatch:** GPS trackers generate data every few seconds, while scanners generate events perhaps every few minutes. We must aggregate or interpolate the high-frequency GPS data (e.g., calculating total travel time between two scan points) or use machine learning techniques to infer meaningful activities (e.g., "Driving," "Idling") from GPS speed/status flags.
2.  **Linking Planned vs. Actual:** The Dispatch system provides the *intended* sequence (e.g., Stop 1, Stop 2, ..., Stop 35). We must map the actual delivery scan events to this intended sequence number using the Package ID and Dispatch data.
3.  **Integrating Maintenance:** Maintenance events must be linked to the specific operational day (Case ID) they interrupt, noting the duration of the interruption (using Maintenance Log start/end times).

### Process Discovery

We will use **Heuristic Mining** on the *actual* delivery sequence (Package ID level) to discover the dominant process flow variants. This will visualize:

1.  **The Ideal Path:** Depot departure $\rightarrow$ Travel $\rightarrow$ Service $\rightarrow$ Repeat $\rightarrow$ Depot Return.
2.  **Real Variants:** Paths showing failed attempts ($\rightarrow$ Depart Customer $\rightarrow$ Travel $\rightarrow$ Arrive Customer X $\rightarrow$ Delivery Success), unplanned stops ($\rightarrow$ Unscheduled Stop $\rightarrow$ Travel $\rightarrow$ Resume Route), and sequencing errors.
3.  **Frequency & Throughput:** The discovered model highlights which variants occur most often and the associated duration (throughput time) for each step.

### Conformance Checking

Conformance checking compares the discovered *As-Is* process model against the *To-Be* model derived from the Dispatch System’s planned routes.

*   **To-Be Model:** A sequential, linear path representing the expected order of 35 stops.
*   **Deviations Looked For:**
    *   **Sequence Deviations:** A stop sequence is found that bypasses planned stops or jumps ahead significantly (e.g., skipping Stop 5 to do Stop 15).
    *   **Activity Deviations:** The presence of unplanned activities like 'Unscheduled Stop' or 'Engine Warning Light' occurring *mid-route*.
    *   **Temporal Deviations:** Significant delta between the planned arrival time for Stop $N$ (derived from Dispatch ETA) and the actual 'Arrive Customer' timestamp. A consistent 20-minute delay on all morning routes suggests systemic planning flaws, not just random bad luck.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

To address the core goals (punctuality and cost), we must define quantifiable metrics based on the event log attributes.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Calculation

| KPI | Calculation Method | Relevant Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTD)** | Count of (Delivery Success where Arrival Time $\le$ Time Window End) / Total Successful Deliveries. | Punctuality |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | Sum of 'Travel Time' (between stops, inferred from GPS) / Sum of 'Service Time' (Time between 'Arrive Customer' and 'Depart Customer'). | Efficiency/Cost |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (Total Driving Time + Total Service Time) / Total Shift Duration (Start Shift to End Shift). | Efficiency/Cost |
| **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays** | Count and duration of events flagged as 'Low Speed Detected' or 'Traffic Jam' during travel phases. | Punctuality/Cost |
| **Rate of Failed Deliveries (RFD)** | Count of 'Delivery Failed' events / Total Package Scans. | Punctuality/Cost (rework) |
| **Cost Proxy: Idling Rate** | Total time where Speed = 0 km/h AND Status = Moving/Ignition On, divided by Total Shift Time. (High idling directly correlates with fuel waste). | Cost |

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

We apply performance analysis by overlaying time measures (e.g., average throughput time, variance) onto the discovered process model, segmented by relevant dimensions:

1.  **Activity Bottlenecks:** Identify activities with exceptionally long average durations or high variance. If the 'Service Time' activity consistently takes 15 minutes when the historical average is 5 minutes, the bottleneck is *at the customer location* (e.g., finding the entry, customer delay).
2.  **Route/Geographic Bottlenecks:** Filter the log by Location/Route Segment. If **Route Segment A** always adds 45 minutes to the planned travel time, regardless of the driver, the bottleneck is geographical (e.g., a poorly mapped road segment or chronic congestion hotspot).
3.  **Resource Bottlenecks (Driver/Vehicle):** Segment the performance KPIs by Driver ID or Vehicle ID. If Driver D105 has a significantly higher RFD or Service Time ratio than the fleet average, the issue lies in driver training or skill. If Vehicle V12 has frequent 'Unscheduled Stop' events, the bottleneck is asset reliability.

By quantifying the impact (e.g., "Bottleneck at Stop 12 adds an average of 18 minutes, impacting 40% of daily deliveries"), we prioritize remediation efforts.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Process mining allows us to move beyond *where* delays occur to hypothesize *why*.

| Potential Root Cause | Supporting Process Mining Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Suboptimal Static Route Planning** | **Conformance Check Results:** High deviation from the planned sequence. **Variant Analysis:** Comparing the performance (time/distance) of planned routes versus actual successful routes suggests the dispatch algorithm is ignoring real-world traffic patterns. |
| **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations** | **Time Delta Analysis:** Comparing Dispatch ETA vs. Actual Travel Time derived from GPS segments. If the delta is consistently positive during peak hours (7 AM – 9 AM), the underlying traffic model used for planning is outdated or too simplistic. |
| **High Variability in Service Time** | **Dwell Time Analysis:** Filtering service time by Package Type or Customer Type (if discernible from notes). High variability suggests inconsistency in finding parking, accessing buildings, or specific customer interaction protocols. |
| **Impact of Traffic Congestion** | **Correlation Analysis:** Overlaying GPS speed data points tagged as 'Low Speed' onto external map data (historical traffic patterns). If delays cluster geographically during known rush hours, the cause is external congestion not reflected in the plan. |
| **High Frequency of Failed Deliveries** | **Rework Analysis:** Tracing the path after a 'Delivery Failed' event. If the subsequent re-attempt is logged days later, it’s a logistical failure. If the re-attempt happens immediately within the same shift, it's a productivity drain that needs scheduling/routing intervention. |
| **Vehicle Maintenance Issues** | **Frequency Analysis:** Correlating 'Unscheduled Stop' events across the fleet. If specific Vehicle IDs consistently generate these events alongside specific error codes, the root cause is predictable asset failure. |

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Based on potential insights derived from the analyses above, here are three concrete, data-driven strategies:

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Sequencing and Time Window Refinement

*   **Targets:** Inaccurate delivery estimates and poor OTD rates.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** Outdated travel time estimations and static route planning that fails to adapt to real-time variables.
*   **Process Mining Support:** Use the **Time Delta Analysis** (Section 3) to build a highly localized, time-of-day-dependent travel time matrix for every road segment between planned stops.
*   **Action:** Implement a dynamic routing engine that adjusts the sequence and time windows *mid-shift* based on current location and newly calculated ETAs, prioritizing customers whose windows are tightest, rather than strictly adhering to the morning dispatch plan.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Significant improvement in **OTD Rate** (Target: 95%+); Reduced variability in **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio**.

### Strategy 2: Service Density Optimization via Territory Balancing

*   **Targets:** High workload variability and localized bottlenecks causing overtime.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** Static allocation of delivery territories that may over-commit certain areas (high stop density with complex service requirements) while under-utilizing others.
*   **Process Mining Support:** Use **Bottleneck Identification (Segmentation)**. Identify the top 10% of routes/territories that have the lowest average daily throughput (deliveries completed per hour). Analyze the *average service time* within these low-performing zones.
*   **Action:** Re-allocate low-performing sectors (high average service time) to drivers with historically lower service times, or split complex, high-density zones into two smaller routes for the next shift planning cycle.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Reduced **Overtime logged**; Improved **Vehicle Utilization Rate** across the fleet.

### Strategy 3: Proactive Asset Health Management

*   **Targets:** Unscheduled downtime interrupting customer commitments.
*   **Root Cause Addressed:** Reactive maintenance scheduling based on age rather than actual operational stress.
*   **Process Mining Support:** Correlate GPS data attributes (frequency of harsh braking/acceleration—proxies for aggressive driving affecting wear-and-tear) and high *idling time* (fuel inefficiency) with subsequent entries in the Maintenance Log ('Engine Warning Light' or repairs).
*   **Action:** Establish predictive maintenance triggers. If Vehicle V15 logs 15+ hours of excessive idling or shows abnormal acceleration patterns over two weeks, schedule preventative service immediately, rather than waiting for a breakdown during a route.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Drastic reduction in **Frequency/Duration of Unscheduled Stops**; Indirect reduction in **Fuel Consumption per km/package** due to less idling.

## 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

Optimization must remain grounded in practical logistics constraints.

### Accounting for Operational Constraints

1.  **Driver Working Hours & Capacity:** The initial process discovery (Section 1) defines the actual shift duration from 'Start Shift' to 'End Shift.' During strategy implementation (e.g., Strategy 1), conformance checking must actively monitor any variant path that results in a shift duration exceeding mandated limits. If a dynamic route adjustment violates the legal time constraint, the system must default to the next available driver or flag the route for manual review rather than auto-assigning.
2.  **Vehicle Capacity:** Capacity constraints should be integrated as a mandatory attribute linked to the 'Depart Depot' event. Analyses involving routing (Strategy 2) must be filtered to only consider packages assigned within the declared capacity boundary for that specific vehicle/shift.

### Continuous Monitoring Plan

After implementing optimizations, a real-time process mining dashboard will ensure sustainability and allow for rapid course correction:

1.  **Baseline Comparison Dashboard:** The primary view compares current KPIs (OTD, RFD, Overtime) against the **pre-optimization baseline** established in Section 2. Any significant negative drift triggers immediate alerts.
2.  **Conformance Monitoring View:** A live view tracking adherence to the *new* optimized routes (Strategy 1 and 2). Alerts are generated if drivers frequently deviate from the dynamically sequenced route by more than a threshold (e.g., skipping three consecutive optimized stops).
3.  **Exception Alerting:** Monitoring for high-frequency, high-impact events that were previously invisible:
    *   **Unplanned Stop Frequency:** Immediate alerts if any vehicle records an unscheduled stop for longer than 15 minutes, allowing dispatch to investigate potential safety or maintenance issues instantly.
    *   **Service Time Spikes:** Real-time flagging if service time at a customer location exceeds 2.5x the newly established *optimized* average for that zone.

By maintaining continuous process visibility, Speedy Parcels shifts from reactive problem-solving to proactive operational management, ensuring efficiency gains are realized and maintained.
