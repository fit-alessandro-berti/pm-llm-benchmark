Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation:
- The subquery identifies `case_id`s where the event count is six or fewer.
- The outer query filters the original `event_log` table to return only events from those cases.
