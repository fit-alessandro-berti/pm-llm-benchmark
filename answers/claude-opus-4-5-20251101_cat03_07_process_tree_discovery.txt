# Process Tree Analysis

## Observed Behavior from Event Log

Let me analyze the traces from the event log:

**Case 1:** RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC
**Case 2:** RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC
**Case 3:** RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

## Key Observations

1. **Fixed Start:** All cases begin with `RA` (Receive Application)
2. **Initial Validation:** Followed by `VF` (Validate Form)
3. **Assessment:** Then `AE` (Assess Eligibility)
4. **Optional Loop:** After assessment, there may be:
   - Zero iterations (Case 2): directly to AD
   - One or more iterations of requesting missing info (RMI) followed by re-validation (VF)
5. **Fixed End Sequence:** All cases end with `AD  SC  AC`

## Loop Pattern Analysis

The loop behavior shows:
- Case 2: No loop (0 iterations)
- Case 1: RMI  VF (1 iteration)
- Case 3: RMI  RMI  VF (multiple RMI before VF)

The pattern in Case 3 suggests RMI itself can repeat. So the loop body contains a sequence where RMI can occur one or more times, followed by VF.

## Final Process Tree Model

```
-> (
    'RA',
    'VF',
    'AE',
    * (
        tau,
        -> (
            * (
                'RMI',
                tau
            ),
            'VF'
        )
    ),
    'AD',
    'SC',
    'AC'
)
```

## Explanation

**In text notation:**
```
-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', * ( tau, -> ( * ( 'RMI', tau ), 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )
```

**Structure breakdown:**

1. **Main Sequence (->):** The overall process is a sequence of activities
2. **RA  VF  AE:** Fixed initial sequence
3. **Loop for Missing Info `* ( tau, -> ( * ( 'RMI', tau ), 'VF' ) )`:**
   - The outer loop has `tau` as the "do" part (allowing zero iterations = skip)
   - The loop body is a sequence of:
     - An inner loop `* ( 'RMI', tau )` allowing one or more RMI requests
     - Followed by `VF` (re-validation)
4. **AD  SC  AC:** Fixed final sequence

## Simplified Alternative (if RMI only occurs once per re-validation cycle)

If we interpret Case 3 as two separate loop iterations rather than multiple RMIs:

```
-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', * ( tau, -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )
```

This simpler model:
- Starts with RA  VF  AE
- Has an optional loop where each iteration does RMI  VF
- Ends with AD  SC  AC

**This simplified version is the recommended final model** as it balances fitness, precision, and simplicity effectively.
