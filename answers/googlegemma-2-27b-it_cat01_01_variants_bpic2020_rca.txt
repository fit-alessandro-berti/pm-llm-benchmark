Based on the data you provided, here's an analysis of potential performance bottlenecks in a process, considering the following:

* **High-Rejection Paths:**

Many paths show "REJECTED" or "REJECT" labelled steps highlighting instances where rework or unplanned steps are causing delays. Analyzing these paths and the reasons behind the rejections can pinpoint inefficiencies.

* **Frequent "BUDGET OWNER" Review:** 

The fact that **"Request APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION (BUDGET OWNER)"** appears as a significant reason for delays suggests a need to investigate this step further.

* **Rework Loops:**

  * **"Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION ->...".** Analyze the specific reasons for the rejections by ADMINISTRATION to see if there are any recurring issues or systemic issues leading to rejections. 

**Possible Data-Driven Root Causes for Performance Issues:**

While precise performance metrics (like total processing time) are missing from the data you provided, we can analyze the provided information to identify some potential bottlenecks.

1. **High Rejection Rate - Figure out why:**

    * The high "REJECTED" frequency suggests a potential bottleneck in the approval process.
    * Investigate the **"REJECTION"** path  to analyze potential reasons for the rejections. These could be anything from inconsistencies in data provided to limitations in the Mark of a process due to multiple roles needing to review and correct information.
    * Analyze the reasons for the highest " Häufigkeit" (between the "Rejected by ADMINISTRATION" and "BUDGET OWNER" 

* **"BUDGET OWNER" needs to be broken down:** The **"APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER"** step might also require analysis. It is a potential bottleneck since it involves steps that likely require an extra review (depending on the exact nature of the activity). It would be helpful to know:**
    * **How often is a "State Study" rejected compared to the average completion rate?**
    *  **What's the average time for a "REJECTED" process instance vs. approved ones?**

This is crucial information needed to identify potential rework and inefficiencies: 

* **Waiting Times:** Analyze the duration of each activity, focusing on those that involve manual tasks or external departments. Look for delays compared to the overall average time. Which paths suffer the most rejections? 

**Targeting Specifics for Improvement:**

The provided data isn't sufficient to identify the root causes of the performance issues directly. To diagnose the root causes effectively, you
