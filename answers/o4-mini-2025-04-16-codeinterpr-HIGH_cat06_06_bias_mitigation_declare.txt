Here is the updated `declare_model` with a set of bias-mitigating DECLARE constraints added. All new links use support = 1.0 and confidence = 1.0, in the same format as the original model.

```python

Rationale for the new constraints:

1. **coexistence (Sensitive Decision  ManualReview)**  
   Ensures that *whenever* a decision involving a sensitive subgroup (e.g. `Approve_Minority`) appears in a trace, a `ManualReview` also appears.  This forces a humanintheloop check to catch potential biases.

2. **response (Attribute Disclosure  BiasMitigationCheck)**  
   Guarantees that *after* any sensitive attribute is read (`CheckApplicantRace`, etc.), the system must execute a `BiasMitigationCheck` before moving on.  This prevents the process from proceeding without an explicit fairness check.

3. **precedence (BiasMitigationCheck  Sensitive Decision)**  
   Ensures that *any* sensitive decision event (e.g. `Reject_Female`) in a trace is only allowed if a `BiasMitigationCheck` has already occurred earlier.  Thus no biased decision can happen “out of the blue” without mitigation.

4. **nonsuccession (Attribute Disclosure  Decision)**  
   Forbids a *direct* handoff from a sensitiveattribute check to any decision (general or subgroup).  In other words, you cannot immediately jump from seeing an applicant’s race/gender/age to “Reject” or “Approve” without first doing the biascheck and/or manual review.

Together, these DECLARE constraints interpose fairness checks and human reviews around any use of sensitive attributes, thereby reducing the risk that the loanapproval process discriminates against protected groups.
