After reviewing the constraints provided, I have identified several potential anomalies and inconsistencies in the proposed process model:

1. **Inconsistent initialization**: The Initialization constraint specifies that the trace starts with one of the activities 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'. However, the Alternate response constraint includes a pair of ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled') which involves only 'Request Payment' as the starting activity. To resolve this inconsistency, the model should be modified to either remove one of these constraints or ensure that all starting activities from multiple constraints share a common element.

2. **Cyclic dependencies**: The Precedence constraint includes ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), and the Succession constraint also involves ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment') as well as the Response and Chain response constraints involving this sequence. There is a cyclic dependency in the form of an 'A B' relation that depends back on 'B'. Such cycles are generally avoided or managed using specific constructs like "infinite loops" or additional control states to manage them.

3. **Precedence for the chain**: The Precedence constraint includes ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment') and 'Chain precedence' includes this same pair, and then it gets included in the 'Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment"), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment)', which introduces ambiguity.

4. **Alternating precedence, Alternate response**: The model defines alternative constraints (like alternate response and alternate precedence). It is not obvious how these might be combined or if some pairs can be used instead of others.

5. **Missing Transitions between non Co-Exist entities**: As per the provided information for 'Non Co-existence', it should be checked whether there are also activities with ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled') in reverse relationship but is not present now which could lead to loss of transaction flow integrity during execution.

Here's a step-by-step summary of resolving or checking these inconsistencies within this provided model: 

1. Re-evaluate Constraints 
2. Re-calcuate the model using appropriate tools or graphviz to visualize and better identify potential cycle, redundancy.
