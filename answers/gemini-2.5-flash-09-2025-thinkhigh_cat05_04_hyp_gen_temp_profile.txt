### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile

The temporal profile reveals several deviations from what might be expected in a typical, stable claims processing workflow, suggesting systemic influences or skipped steps:

| Activity Pair | Average Time (Seconds) | Standard Deviation (Seconds) | Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R to P** | 90,000 (~25 hours) | 3,600 (1 hour) | **Suspiciously Low STDEV:** The standard deviation is only 4% of the mean. This highly rigid timing suggests the approval step is not triggered organically by human evaluation but is likely governed by a fixed schedule or batch process. |
| **P to N** | 604,800 (7 days) | 172,800 (2 days) | **Excessive Delay:** A 7-day average delay between final Approval (P) and Customer Notification (N) is highly unusual. This suggests a major systemic bottleneck, a regulatory waiting period, or reliance on a weekly batch process for customer communication. |
| **A to C** | 7,200 (2 hours) | 3,600 (1 hour) | **Premature Closure:** A quick average closure (C) after Assignment (A) bypasses the expected steps of Evaluation (E) and Approval (P). This strongly suggests administrative closures or immediate rejection/cancellation of certain claims. |
| **E to N** | 300 (5 minutes) | 60 (1 minute) | **Too Rapid Transition:** The near-instantaneous transition from Evaluation (E) to Notification (N) indicates a fully automated system handover, or potentially that the Notification step is merely a system flag triggered immediately upon completion of E, potentially skipping the human review associated with the P (Approve) step. |

### Hypotheses for Anomalous Behavior

| Anomaly | Primary Hypothesis | Supporting Factors |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R to P (Rigid Timing)** | **Scheduled Batch Processing:** Approvals are processed in periodic batches (e.g., daily at 2 AM) rather than immediately following evaluation. Claims wait until the next scheduled window, causing the average to stabilize around 25 hours regardless of when the claim was submitted. | Could be linked to resource constraints or nightly system synchronization requirements. |
| **P to N (7-Day Delay)** | **Regulatory/Administrative Waiting Period or External Dependency:** The claim requires a mandatory "cooling-off" period post-approval before the customer is notified, or the notification process is outsourced (e.g., weekly physical mailing service). | This large, specific delay suggests a known, planned constraint outside of typical processing time. |
| **A to C (2-Hour Closure)** | **Immediate Administrative Closure/Duplicate Rejection:** Adjusters or automated systems quickly identify claims that are invalid, duplicates, or fall outside policy scope immediately after assignment, leading to closure before any in-depth evaluation is required. | This pattern likely relates to specific claim types or low-value claims where initial checks are sufficient for rejection. |
| **E to N (5-Minute Transition)** | **Full Automation of Final Steps:** The Evaluation step (E) registers the data input, and the subsequent Approval (P, if it exists) and Notification (N) are automated system triggers that execute almost instantly upon the finalization of E. | Indicates a potential lack of human validation/review time between E and N, which is risky if E involves subjective judgments. |

### Proposed Verification Approaches (SQL Queries)

The following PostgreSQL queries are designed to test the hypotheses by isolating claims exhibiting the anomalous behavior and correlating them with resource or claim characteristics.

#### 1. Verifying Administrative Closure and Skipped Steps (A to C Anomaly)

**Goal:** Identify claims that closed quickly after assignment and explicitly confirm whether the Evaluation (E) or Approval (P) steps were entirely missed. Correlate these skipped claims with the responsible adjuster or claim type.

```sql
WITH AssignmentToClosure AS (
    SELECT
        a.claim_id,
        a.timestamp AS assign_time,
        c.timestamp AS close_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds,
        a.resource AS assigning_adjuster
    FROM claim_events a
    JOIN claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE a.activity = 'A' AND c.activity = 'C'
),
SkippedSteps AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        claim_id
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P')
)
SELECT
    atc.claim_id,
    atc.duration_seconds,
    cl.claim_type,
    adj.name AS adjuster_name
FROM AssignmentToClosure atc
JOIN claims cl ON atc.claim_id = cl.claim_id
JOIN adjusters adj ON atc.assigning_adjuster = adj.adjuster_id::text  -- Assuming resource stores adjuster_id
LEFT JOIN SkippedSteps ss ON atc.claim_id = ss.claim_id
WHERE
    atc.duration_seconds < 14400 -- Filter for claims closed in under 4 hours (2*STDEV beyond avg)
    AND ss.claim_id IS NULL       -- Filter where NO evaluation or approval event exists
ORDER BY
    atc.duration_seconds;
```

#### 2. Analyzing the P to N Bottleneck (7-Day Delay)

**Goal:** Calculate the duration for all P to N sequences. Analyze the distribution of this delay, specifically looking for clustering around 7 days (604,800 seconds) and check if specific claim types or regions are disproportionately affected by the long wait time.

```sql
WITH ApprovalToNotification AS (
    SELECT
        p.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events p
    JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
    WHERE
        p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
        -- Ensure N occurs after P chronologically
        AND n.timestamp > p.timestamp
)
SELECT
    cl.claim_type,
    adj.region,
    COUNT(apt.claim_id) AS total_claims,
    AVG(apt.duration_seconds) AS average_p_to_n_delay,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY apt.duration_seconds) AS p95_delay_seconds
FROM ApprovalToNotification apt
JOIN claims cl ON apt.claim_id = cl.claim_id
JOIN claim_events p_event ON apt.claim_id = p_event.claim_id AND p_event.activity = 'P'
JOIN adjusters adj ON p_event.resource = adj.adjuster_id::text
GROUP BY
    cl.claim_type, adj.region
ORDER BY
    average_p_to_n_delay DESC;
```

#### 3. Investigating Rigid R to P Timing (Low STDEV Anomaly)

**Goal:** Test the hypothesis of batch processing by analyzing when the 'P' (Approval) activity occurs relative to the 'R' (Receive) time. If approval is scheduled, the time difference should cluster tightly around specific intervals (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours).

```sql
WITH ReceiveToApprove AS (
    SELECT
        r.claim_id,
        r.timestamp AS receive_time,
        p.timestamp AS approve_time,
        EXTRACT(HOUR FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS duration_hours
    FROM claim_events r
    JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
    WHERE r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
    AND p.timestamp > r.timestamp
)
SELECT
    -- Group duration into 6-hour buckets to identify clustering patterns
    FLOOR(duration_hours / 6) * 6 AS duration_bucket_hours,
    COUNT(claim_id) AS claims_in_bucket,
    -- Analyze the time of day the approval actually happened
    TO_CHAR(approve_time, 'HH24') AS hour_of_approval
FROM ReceiveToApprove
GROUP BY
    1, 3
ORDER BY
    duration_bucket_hours,
    claims_in_bucket DESC;
```
