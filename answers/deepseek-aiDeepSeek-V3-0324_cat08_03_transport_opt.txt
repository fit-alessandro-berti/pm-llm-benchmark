# **Process Mining Analysis and Optimization for Speedy Parcels**  
### **Comprehensive Approach to Improve Last-Mile Delivery Efficiency**  

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**  

### **Data Preprocessing & Integration**  
**Challenges:**  
- **Heterogeneous Data Sources:**  
  - GPS (lat/lon, speed, ignition status)  
  - Scanner data (delivery milestones)  
  - Dispatch (planned routes, time windows)  
  - Maintenance logs (downtime, repairs)  
  - *Challenge:* Timestamp and event alignment across sources.  
- **Noise & Missing Data:**  
  - GPS gaps due to signal loss, incorrect scanner entries.  
  - *Challenge:* Missing events can distort process models.  

**Solution:**  
- **Case ID Definition:** `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., `V12-20241205`).  
- **Event Correlation:** Link `Package ID` to delivery stops for traceability.  
- **Timeline Alignment:** Merge GPS and scanner data using timestamps.  
- **Handling Missing Data:**  
  - Interpolate missing GPS tracking points.  
  - Use business rules to impute missing scanner events (e.g., if `Arrive Customer` missing but `Delivery Success` exists).  

### **Process Discovery (Actual vs. Planned)**  
- **Techniques:**  
  - **Directly Follows Graph (DFG):** Visualize common event sequences.  
  - **Petri Net / BPMN Model:** Show deviations (e.g., unexpected detours).  
  - **Variant Analysis:** Compare frequent vs. rare process paths.  

**Expected Discoveries:**  
- Common deviations (e.g., unplanned stops, re-attempts for failed deliveries).  
- Excessive idle time between `Depart Customer` and next `Arrive Customer`.  

### **Conformance Checking (vs. Dispatch Plans)**  
- **Alignment-Based Checking:** Compare GPS paths vs. planned routes.  
- **Deviations to Detect:**  
  - **Sequence Violations:** Stops performed out of order.  
  - **Unplanned Stops:** Fuel breaks, unscheduled maintenance.  
  - **Timing Gaps:** Delays due to traffic, long dwell times.  
  - **Failed Deliveries:** High re-attempt rates for certain zones.  

**Output:** Heatmaps of deviations and bottleneck detection.

## **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**  

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
| KPI | Calculation Method | Relevance |  
|-----|-------------------|-----------|  
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | `(Deliveries within window) / (Total deliveries)` | Punctuality |  
| **Avg. Time per Stop** | `((Depart Customer - Arrive Customer)) / (#Stops)` | Efficiency |  
| **Travel vs. Service Time Ratio** | `(Moving Time) / (Stop Time)` | Fuel & Labor Cost |  
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | `(Failed attempts) / (Total attempts)` | Customer Experience |  
| **Vehicle Utilization** | `(Active Delivery Time) / (Total Shift Time)` | Resource Efficiency |  
| **Traffic Delay Duration** | `(Speed < 10 km/h for >5 min)` | Route Optimization |  

### **Bottleneck Detection Techniques**  
- **Performance Spectrum Analysis:**  
  - Long dwell times at certain stops (parking issues? customer wait?).  
- **Resource Pool Analysis:**  
  - Compare driver/vehicle efficiency across routes.  
- **Spatial Bottleneck Detection:**  
  - GPS speed analysis  Traffic hotspots.  
- **Failed Delivery Correlation:**  
  - High frequency in specific areas  Bad customer time windows.  

**Example Findings:**  
- **Traffic hotspots** (recurring slow-speed zones).  
- **Driver Skill Gaps:** Some take longer per delivery than peers.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**  

| **Inefficiency** | **Potential Root Cause** | **Process Mining Validation** |  
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|  
| High Failed Deliveries | Inflexible time windows | Variant analysis: More failures in AM slots |  
| Excessive Fuel Costs | Suboptimal routing | Conformance: Frequent backtracking, detours |  
| Late Deliveries | Traffic delays + static routes | GPS-speed heatmaps over time |  
| Long Service Time | Driver inexperience | KPI comparison by driver |  
| Unscheduled Maintenance | Overutilization of older vans | Correlation: High-id vehicles = more breakdowns |  

**Methods:**  
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare fastest vs. slowest routes.  
- **Regression Analysis:** Predict delays based on traffic/weather.

## **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**  

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments**  
- **Targeted Issue:** Traffic delays, backtracking.  
- **Root Cause:** Static routes ignore real-time conditions.  
- **Data Support:** GPS-speed heatmaps + conformance deviations.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  -  Travel time by 15-20%.  
  -  On-time delivery rate.  

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**  
- **Targeted Issue:** Unscheduled breakdowns.  
- **Root Cause:** Overuse of certain vehicles.  
- **Data Support:** Maintenance logs + vehicle utilization KPIs.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  -  Downtime by 30%.  

### **Strategy 3: Customer Time Slot Optimization**  
- **Targeted Issue:** Failed deliveries.  
- **Root Cause:** Inflexible time windows.  
- **Data Support:** Failed delivery clustering by hour/area.  
- **Expected Impact:**  
  -  Failed attempts by 25%.

## **5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring**  

### **Constraints to Consider:**  
- Driver shifts (avoid overtime).  
- Vehicle load capacity (avoid overloading).  

### **Monitoring Dashboard KPIs:**  
- **Live Traffic Delay Alerts** (GPS speed thresholds).  
- **Failed Delivery Heatmaps** (updated daily).  
- **Driver Efficiency Rankings** (weekly reports).  

**Conclusion:** Process mining enables **root-cause visibility**, leading to targeted, efficient solutions.
