It’s a BPMN-style process diagram showing a multi-department workflow that starts in Sales on Monday morning. In the Sales lane, the order is checked for completeness and the customer is verified in the database; if the customer isn’t found, they’re added. Then the order details are passed to Production, which plans and manufactures the product. Meanwhile, Procurement may handle materials through a “Material Compensation Subprocess” that orders materials, checks them, and returns faulty items if needed; a problem at this stage can cancel the process. Once Production completes the product, the Warehouse sends it to the customer. Finally, Sales drafts an invoice after the product is sent.
