Below is a consolidated event log derived from the provided tables. Each row is one event; Case ID = order_id. Activities reflect the typical order-to-cash lifecycle. Resource names and roles are resolved where possible from the Resources table. Additional relevant attributes are included.

Assumptions (summary)
- Case ID = order_id.
- Item picking events: one event per order line (using item_picking_date).
- Delivery events: each dispatch and each arrival are separate events (one row each), using delivery_dispatch_date and delivery_arrival_date.
- Invoice events: one event per invoice issuance (invoice_issue_date).
- Payment events: one event per payment (payment_date). Payments are linked to invoices via invoice_id.
- Resource column shows resolved resource_name and role where available. For deliveries, the carrier (resource) is used.
- Times kept in the provided UTC timestamps (Z).
- If an order has no delivery/invoice/payment record in the input, those events are simply absent.

Notes on data completeness
- Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment records in the provided tables — only Order Created and Item Picked events are recorded.
- All resource name/role mappings use the Resources table. Where resource_name exists for an ID we used it; where a payment is a customer action, the Resource is shown as (Customer) with payment method details.
- If you prefer the Resource column to show resource IDs instead of resolved names (or to include both), I can provide a variant.

If you want this exported as CSV/XES or want additional attributes (e.g., item descriptions or item categories) added to item pick events, tell me which format/attributes and I’ll produce it.
