Based on the provided directly follows graph and the frequencies and durations of events, several process and data-specific considerations point to potential root causes for performance issues:

1. **High Durations for Specific Activities**:
   - **Container**: The duration for "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" is extremely high (368943.92). This suggests a significant delay in picking up empty containers after they are ordered.
   - **Container**: The duration for "Drive to Terminal" -> "Weigh" is also high (2559.54), indicating potential delays in the weighing process after driving to the terminal.
   - **Container**: The duration for "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" is very high (743380.51), suggesting a long wait time for containers to be brought to the loading bay after being placed in stock.
   - **Vehicle**: The duration for "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" is very high (295965.56), indicating potential inefficiencies in the booking process.
   - **Transport Document**: The duration for "Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart" is extremely high (1007066.16), suggesting significant delays in the departure process after ordering empty containers.

2. **Frequent Loops and Repetitions**:
   - **Truck**: The event "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" occurs frequently (8559 times) with a relatively high duration (5259.71), indicating repetitive loading activities that could be optimized.
   - **Vehicle**: The event "Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" occurs frequently (1827 times) with a duration of 1960.59, suggesting repetitive loading activities.
   - **Forklift**: The event "Place in Stock" -> "Weigh" occurs frequently (1326 times) with a high duration (26927.52), indicating repetitive weighing activities.

3. **Inefficient Transitions**:
   - **Container**: The transition from "Weigh" to "Place in Stock" has a high duration (1960.09), suggesting inefficiencies in the process of placing containers in stock after weighing.
   - **Container**: The transition from "Bring to Loading Bay" to "Reschedule Container" has a high duration (7110.06), indicating potential delays in rescheduling containers after bringing them to the loading bay.
   - **Vehicle**: The transition from "Book Vehicles" to "Reschedule Container" has a very high duration (371476.42), suggesting significant delays in rescheduling containers after booking vehicles.

4. **Low Frequency of Critical Events**:
   - **Handling Unit**: The transition from "Collect Goods" to "Load Truck" has a high frequency (10553) but a relatively high duration (7820.93), indicating potential delays in loading trucks after collecting goods.
   - **Customer Order**: The transition from "Register Customer Order" to "Create Transport Document" has a high duration (329005.22), suggesting delays in creating transport documents after registering customer orders.

5. **High Frequency with High Duration**:
   - **Container**: The transition from "Drive to Terminal" to "Load Truck" has a high frequency (1989) and a high duration (10999.07), indicating potential inefficiencies in the process of loading trucks after driving to the terminal.
   - **Transport Document**: The transition from "Depart" to "Depart" has a high frequency (142) and a very high duration (1051301.41), suggesting significant delays in the departure process.

Addressing these specific issues by optimizing the durations of high-delay activities, reducing repetitive tasks, and improving the efficiency of transitions could significantly enhance the overall performance of the process.
