Sure! Based on the constraints you provided, it appears that the process model describes a workflow for handling some kind of declaration, which may require payment. Here is a description of the process:

1. The process is initialized by an employee submitting a declaration (Initialization: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The declaration must be approved by a supervisor (Existence: Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
3. After the declaration is approved by the supervisor, payment may be required (Co-Existence: Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Payment Handled). If payment is required, it must be handled exactly once (Exactly 1: Payment Handled).
4. The declaration must be submitted by the employee before it can be approved by the supervisor (Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')).
5. The payment must be handled after the declaration is approved by the supervisor (Response: ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled')).
6. The payment must be handled after the declaration is submitted by the employee (Responded Existence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')).
7. The payment must be handled after a request for payment is made (Responded Existence: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')).
8. The payment must be handled before the declaration is approved by the supervisor (Alternate Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled')).
9. The payment must be handled before a request for payment is made (Alternate Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')).
10. The payment must be handled immediately after the request for payment is made (Chain Precedence: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')).
11. The declaration must be approved by the supervisor immediately after it is submitted by the employee (Chain Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')).
12. The declaration must be approved by the supervisor before it can be submitted again (Non Co-Existence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')).
13. The payment must not be handled before the declaration is submitted by the employee (Non Succession: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')).
14. The payment must not be handled before a request for payment is made (Non Succession: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')).
15. The declaration must not be approved by the supervisor before it is submitted by the employee (Non Chain Succession: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')).
