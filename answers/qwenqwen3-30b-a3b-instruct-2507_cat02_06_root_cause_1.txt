Let’s analyze the **Customer Support Ticket Resolution** event log step by step to identify performance bottlenecks, root causes of delays, and provide actionable recommendations.

---

##  **Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Time for Each Case**

We compute the time difference between **"Receive Ticket"** and **"Close Ticket"** for each case.

| Case ID | Receive Ticket (Start) | Close Ticket (End) | Total Duration |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 101    | 2024-03-01 08:00       | 2024-03-01 10:15   | 2h 15m         |
| 102    | 2024-03-01 08:05       | 2024-03-02 09:15   | 25h 10m        |
| 103    | 2024-03-01 08:10       | 2024-03-01 09:30   | 1h 20m         |
| 104    | 2024-03-01 08:20       | 2024-03-02 08:30   | 24h 10m        |
| 105    | 2024-03-01 08:25       | 2024-03-03 09:30   | 49h 5m         |

###  **Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

- **Case 105**: 49h 5m  **More than double the average**  
- **Case 102**: 25h 10m  
- **Case 104**: 24h 10m  

The average resolution time of the other three cases (101, 103) is around **1h 30m**, so **Case 105** stands out as **extremely delayed**.

>  **Conclusion**: Cases **102, 104, and especially 105** have significantly longer resolution times.

##  **Step 2: Identify Root Causes of Delays**

Let’s analyze each delayed case in detail.

---

###  **Case 105 – 49h 5m (Longest Delay)**

| Activity | Timestamp | Time Since Previous |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Receive Ticket | 2024-03-01 08:25 | — |
| Triage Ticket | 2024-03-01 08:35 | 10m |
| Assign to Level-1 Agent | 2024-03-01 09:00 | 25m |
| Investigate Issue | 2024-03-01 09:10 | 10m |
| **Escalate to Level-2 Agent** | 2024-03-01 10:00 | **50m** |
| **Investigate Issue (Level-2)** | 2024-03-02 14:00 | **38h**  |
| Resolve Ticket | 2024-03-03 09:00 | 39h |
| Close Ticket | 2024-03-03 09:30 | 30m |

####  Key Observations:
- **Massive gap between escalation and Level-2 investigation**:  
  - Escalated at **2024-03-01 10:00**, but Level-2 investigation didn’t start until **2024-03-02 14:00**  **38 hours** delay.
- This is likely due to **lack of immediate follow-up** after escalation.
- The ticket was **not resolved until 2 days later**, despite being escalated.

>  **Root Cause**: **Long waiting period after escalation** — likely due to missing SLA monitoring, poor handover process, or lack of prioritization.

---

###  **Case 102 – 25h 10m**

| Activity | Timestamp | Time Since Previous |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Receive Ticket | 2024-03-01 08:05 | — |
| Triage Ticket | 2024-03-01 08:30 | 25m |
| Assign to Level-1 Agent | 2024-03-01 09:00 | 30m |
| **Escalate to Level-2 Agent** | 2024-03-01 11:30 | 2h 30m |
| **Investigate Issue (Level-2)** | 2024-03-01 14:00 | 2h 30m |
| Resolve Ticket | 2024-03-02 09:00 | 19h |
| Close Ticket | 2024-03-02 09:15 | 15m |

####  Key Observations:
- Escalation occurred at **11:30**, and investigation by Level-2 started at **14:00**  **2.5 hours delay**.
- Resolution began at **09:00 next day**  **19 hours after investigation started**.
- This indicates **delays in investigation and resolution**, possibly due to:
  - High workload on Level-2 team
  - Lack of availability or response protocols

>  **Root Cause**: **Delayed investigation after escalation** and **long resolution time post-investigation**.

---

###  **Case 104 – 24h 10m**

| Activity | Timestamp | Time Since Previous |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Receive Ticket | 2024-03-01 08:20 | — |
| Triage Ticket | 2024-03-01 09:00 | 40m |
| Assign to Level-1 Agent | 2024-03-01 09:30 | 30m |
| **Investigate Issue** | 2024-03-01 13:00 | **3h 30m**  |
| Resolve Ticket | 2024-03-02 08:00 | 19h |
| Close Ticket | 2024-03-02 08:30 | 30m |

####  Key Observations:
- **3.5 hours between assignment and start of investigation**.
- No escalation occurred, so this is a **Level-1 agent delay**.
- Investigation started at **13:00**, but resolution didn’t begin until **08:00 next day**  **19 hours gap**.

>  **Root Cause**:  
> - **Long idle time after assignment** (3.5h)  
> - **No immediate investigation** despite assignment  
> - **Resolution delayed overnight**, possibly due to shift handover or lack of urgency

---

##  **Step 3: Summary of Root Causes**

| Factor | Identified In Cases | Description |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Escalation Delay** | 102, 105 | Long time between escalation and Level-2 investigation (up to 38h) |
| **Post-Assignment Delay** | 104 | 3.5h delay between assignment and investigation start |
| **Overnight Resolution Gap** | 104, 105 | Resolution starts after 12+ hours of inactivity |
| **Lack of Immediate Action Post-Escalation** | 105 | No investigation until next day |
| **No SLA Monitoring or Alerts** | All delayed cases | No automated alerts for pending escalations or investigations |

---

##  **Insights & Recommendations**

###  **Key Insight**:
> **Delays are not due to complexity alone**, but rather **process inefficiencies**:
> - **Escalations are not actioned promptly**
> - **Agents are not starting investigations immediately after assignment**
> - **No real-time tracking or alerts** for stalled tickets
> - **Resolution is often delayed overnight**, suggesting poor shift coordination or prioritization

---

###  **Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks**

#### 1. **Implement Escalation SLAs with Automated Alerts**
- Define **maximum time between escalation and investigation start** (e.g., 1 hour).
- Set up **automated notifications** to Level-2 team when escalation occurs.
- Use a dashboard to flag overdue escalations.

>  *This would prevent 38h delays like in Case 105.*

#### 2. **Enforce “Start Investigation” Within X Minutes of Assignment**
- Set a rule: "Investigation must begin within 1 hour of assignment."
- Track and report on compliance.
- Use system alerts for tickets that exceed this threshold.

>  *Would fix the 3.5h delay in Case 104.*

#### 3. **Introduce Shift Handover Protocols**
- Ensure tickets not resolved by end of shift are **automatically flagged** and **reassigned or prioritized** for next shift.
- Use a “ticket health” score to prioritize unresolved tickets.

>  *Would prevent overnight delays in resolution (Case 104 & 105).*

#### 4. **Monitor and Analyze “Time Between Events”**
- Calculate **cycle time between key steps** (e.g., Assign  Investigate, Escalate  Investigate).
- Identify outliers and investigate root causes.
- Use process mining tools to visualize bottlenecks.

>  *Helps detect issues early and measure improvement.*

#### 5. **Classify Tickets by Complexity & Automate Triage**
- Use AI or rules to **auto-triage** tickets, reducing manual triage time.
- Route tickets to correct level based on keywords or category.

>  *Reduces initial delays (e.g., 25m triage in Case 102 could be faster).*

##  Final Summary

| Case | Delay Reason | Recommendation |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 101 | Normal | — |
| 102 | Escalation delay (2.5h) + long resolution | SLA on escalation + shift handover |
| 103 | Fast & efficient | Benchmark for others |
| 104 | 3.5h idle time post-assignment + overnight delay | Enforce investigation SLA + shift protocol |
| 105 | **38h gap post-escalation** + 19h delay | **Critical SLA on escalation + automated alerts** |

---

##  **Conclusion**

The **primary cause of long resolution times** is **not the nature of the issues**, but **process delays** — especially:
- **Failure to act promptly after escalation**
- **Delayed start of investigation**
- **Lack of shift continuity and automation**

By implementing **SLAs, real-time alerts, and shift handover protocols**, the support team can reduce average resolution time by **50% or more**, improve customer satisfaction, and prevent recurring bottlenecks.

>  **Top Priority**: Fix **escalation response time** — this is the single biggest contributor to extreme delays.
