To identify the root causes of performance issues in this process, we need to analyze the provided process variants along with their frequencies and performances. The performance metric seems to represent some form of time or cost associated with each variant.

Firstly, it's important to understand what each step represents:

- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: An employee initiates a declaration.

- **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**: The administration reviews and approves the declaration.

- **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**: The budget owner reviews and approves the declaration.

- **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: The supervisor gives the final approval.

- **Declaration REJECTED by [role]**: A particular role rejects the declaration, possibly sending it back to the employee.

- **Request Payment**: After approvals, a payment request is made.

- **Payment Handled**: The payment is processed and handled.

Given that performance seems to be higher in some variants, especially those with multiple rejections or additional steps, we can infer that these variants are taking longer or costing more. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis:

### 1. Frequency and Performance Analysis

Looking at the frequencies:

- The most frequent path is "SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" with a frequency of 4618.

- This path has a performance of 810187.903, which seems relatively low compared to some other paths.

Paths with higher performances (longer times or higher costs) often involve rejections and resubmissions:

- "SUBMITTED -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" has a performance of 1604595.638.

- Paths involving multiple rejections and resubmissions have even higher performances, such as 2542497.917 and above.

### 2. Identifying Bottlenecks

From the data, it appears that rejections lead to significant performance degradation due to the need for resubmissions and additional processing steps.

- **Administration Rejections**: Multiple instances where declarations are rejected by administration, leading to employee revisions and resubmissions.

- **Supervisor Rejections**: Similar patterns are observed with supervisor rejections.

### 3. Root Causes

#### a. Inefficient Initial Submissions

- **Employee Errors**: Employees may be submitting incomplete or incorrect declarations, leading to rejections from administration or supervisors.

- **Lack of Guidelines**: Insufficient guidance or training for employees on how to properly fill out declarations.

#### b. Lengthy Approval Processes

- **Multiple Levels of Approval**: Declarations need approvals from multiple roles (administration, budget owner, supervisor), each introducing potential delays.

- **Sequential Dependencies**: Each approval step is sequential; a delay in one step affects the entire process.

#### c. Rejection and Resubmission Cycles

- **Time Consuming**: Each rejection requires employees to correct errors and resubmit, adding significant time to the overall process.

- **Resource Intensive**: Both employees and approvers spend additional time on rejections and resubmissions.

#### d. Missing or Incorrect Information

- **Missing Information**: Declarations may be rejected due to missing information, requiring employees to gather and submit additional data.

- **Incorrect Data**: Errors in the submitted data can lead to rejections.

### 4. Specific Process Variants with High Performance

Looking at specific high-performance variants:

- **Variant with Multiple Rejections**:

  - "SUBMITTED -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled"

  - This variant involves two rejection steps before final approval, significantly increasing the performance metric.

- **Variant Involving Budget Owner Approval**:

  - "SUBMITTED -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled"

  - Although this path includes an additional approval step, its frequency is lower (2473) but performance is higher (1084338.407) compared to the direct path.

### 5. Potential Solutions

- **Improve Employee Training**: Provide clearer guidelines and training for employees to reduce errors in initial submissions.

- **Streamline Approval Workflow**: Consider reducing the number of approval steps or implementing parallel approvals to minimize delays.

- **Implement Automated Checks**: Use automated systems to check declarations for completeness and correctness before they reach approvers.

- **Enhance Communication**: Improve communication between employees and approvers to clarify expectations and resolve issues more efficiently.

### Conclusion

The root causes of performance issues in this process are primarily due to inefficient initial submissions leading to multiple rejections and resubmissions, as well as the complexity and length of the approval workflow. Addressing these areas through improved training, streamlined processes, and better communication can help mitigate these performance issues.
