So I've got this big list of different process variants for some kind of declaration or request process. There are a lot of steps involved, like submission, approval, rejection, and payment handling. Each variant has a frequency and a performance number associated with it. The frequency tells us how often that particular sequence of steps occurs, and the performance seems to indicate some sort of time or effort spent on that variant.

My task is to identify the root causes for performance issues in this process, focusing only on process and data-specific considerations, not general ones. So, I need to look at these variants and see where the bottlenecks or inefficiencies might be based on how often certain paths are taken and how much performance they consume.

First, I should probably understand what each step represents:

- "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE": This is likely the starting point where an employee submits a declaration or request.

- "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION": The administration reviews and approves the declaration.

- "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER": Additional approval from the budget owner, perhaps for financial checks.

- "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR": Final approval from a supervisor, maybe the top-level approval.

- "Declaration REJECTED by [role]": At various points, the declaration can be rejected by different roles, which might send it back to the employee for revisions.

- "Request Payment": Once approved, a payment request is made.

- "Payment Handled": The final step where the payment is processed.

There are also some unusual steps like "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE", which might just be saving a draft without submitting, and "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING", which is unclear—maybe rejection due to missing information?

Looking at the frequency and performance:

- Some variants are very common, like the first one with a frequency of 4618 and performance of 810187.903.

- Others are rare, with frequencies in single digits and higher performance times, suggesting possible inefficiencies.

I need to correlate high performance numbers with frequent or critical paths in the process to pinpoint where the bottlenecks are.

One approach is to calculate the total performance for each variant by multiplying frequency and performance. This would give an idea of the overall time or effort spent on each variant.

For example:

- Variant 1: 4618 * 810187.903 = Very large number

- Variant 2: 2473 * 1084338.407 = Another large number

But this might not be the best way because some variants, despite having high performance per instance, occur less frequently.

Alternatively, I could look at performance per transaction, which is just the performance number given for each variant. This seems to represent the average time or effort per instance for that variant.

Given that, variants with high performance numbers indicate inefficiencies in those specific paths.

Looking at the data:

- Variant 1 has a performance of 810187.903, which seems very high. Wait, that can't be right—performance units are not specified, but assuming it's in seconds or minutes, that's a long time.

Wait, actually, looking closer, most performance numbers are in the hundreds of thousands or millions. That seems unrealistic for process times. Maybe performance is in seconds, and these are cumulative times for all instances.

But with frequencies in thousands, even if performance is per instance, 810187.903 seconds per instance is over 9 days per instance, which is Suspicious.

Wait, perhaps performance is in milliseconds or something. But even then, 810187 ms is over 13 minutes per instance.

This seems inconsistent because some variants have much lower performance numbers, which wouldn't make sense if they're supposed to have more steps.

Alternatively, maybe performance is not time but some other metric, like cost or resources used.

Given the uncertainty about what "performance" represents, I'll proceed assuming it's a measure of time or resource consumption per instance.

Now, looking at the process flows:

- Some paths go directly from submission to final approval by supervisor, skipping administration and budget owner approvals.

- Others have multiple levels of approval.

- There are also rejection loops where declarations are rejected and resubmitted, adding extra steps and potentially increasing performance time.

I suspect that variants with more steps and especially those involving rejection loops are contributing to higher performance times.

Let's group the variants based on their paths:

1. Direct path with minimal approvals:

   - Submitted -> Final Approved -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

   - Frequency: 1392, Performance: 854633.975

2. Standard path with administration and supervisor approval:

   - Submitted -> Admin Approved -> Supervisor Final Approved -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

   - Frequency: 4618, Performance: 810187.903

3. Path with additional budget owner approval:

   - Submitted -> Admin Approved -> Budget Owner Approved -> Supervisor Final Approved -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

   - Frequency: 2473, Performance: 1084338.407

4. Path with pre-approver:

   - Submitted -> Pre-Approver Approved -> Supervisor Final Approved -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

   - Frequency: 575, Performance: 861058.409

5. Variants with rejection loops:

   - These have additional steps due to rejections and resubmissions, which likely contribute to higher performance times.

Given that, it seems that even the direct paths have relatively high performance numbers, but the standard and budget owner approval paths have higher frequencies and potentially more steps, which might justify higher performance numbers.

However, some rejection loop variants have even higher performance numbers, suggesting that these are major contributors to performance issues.

For example:

- Variant with multiple rejections and resubmissions has a performance of 2542497.917 (frequency 36)

- Another similar variant has 2790977.310 (frequency 29)

These high performance numbers, combined with somewhat low frequencies, indicate that when rejection loops occur, they lead to significant performance degradation.

Additionally, there are variants where declarations are rejected multiple times before finally being approved, adding extra steps and likely causing delays.

Another consideration is the "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" step, which appears in some variants. This might indicate that declarations are sometimes rejected due to missing information, requiring employees to resubmit with corrections.

This suggests that incomplete submissions are a common issue, leading to additional rounds of rejection and resubmission, which hurts performance.

Furthermore, there are variants where declarations are saved but not submitted, which might indicate that employees are drafting declarations without completing them, but I'm not sure how this affects performance.

Given this analysis, potential root causes for performance issues could be:

1. **Rejection Loops**: Multiple rejections and resubmissions due to incomplete or incorrect information in the declarations.

2. **Complex Approval Paths**: Variants with more approval steps (e.g., involving budget owners or pre-approvers) may inherently take longer due to the additional reviews required.

3. **Lack of Guidance for Employees**: If employees are not provided clear instructions on what is required for a successful submission, they may repeatedly submit incomplete declarations, leading to rejection loops.

4. **Inefficient Approval Processes**: Delays or bottlenecks in the approval steps, particularly in administration, budget owner, or supervisor approvals, could be causing performance issues.

5. **Missing Information Handling**: The "REJECTED by MISSING" step suggests that there is a specific issue with missing information, which needs to be addressed to reduce rejection rates.

To mitigate these issues, possible solutions could include:

- Providing clearer guidelines and checklists for employees to ensure complete and accurate submissions upfront.

- Implementing an automated system to check for missing information before submission, preventing declarations from being rejected due to incomplete data.

- Streamlining the approval process by reducing unnecessary steps or providing faster turnaround times for approvals.

- Offering training or support to employees on how to properly fill out declarations.

However, since the task is to consider only process and data-specific aspects, I should focus on how the process can be improved based on the data provided, rather than general improvements like training or system enhancements.

Looking back at the data, perhaps there are specific steps or roles that are causing delays.

For example, if "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION" has a high performance impact across multiple variants, it might indicate that administration approval is a bottleneck.

Similarly, if "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" has high performance numbers, supervisors might be taking a long time to review and approve declarations.

Additionally, the presence of "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" suggests that there is a specific issue with missing information that needs to be addressed in the process.

Perhaps implementing a step where submissions are pre-checked for completeness before entering the approval could reduce rejection loops and improve performance.

Another idea is to identify and prioritize variants with high frequency and high performance impact, and focus on optimizing those paths.

For instance, the first variant (frequency 4618, performance 810187.903) is very common and has a high performance number. Even small improvements in this path could have a significant overall impact.

In contrast, less frequent variants with extremely high performance numbers may represent edge cases that, while important, may not be as critical from a overall performance perspective.

However, since some of the rejection loop variants have both relatively high frequency and very high performance numbers, they cannot be ignored.

In conclusion, the root causes for performance issues in this process appear to be related to rejection loops caused by incomplete or incorrect submissions, leading to multiple resubmissions and extended processing times.

Additionally, complex approval paths with multiple levels of approval may inherently be slower, contributing to performance problems.

To address these issues, process improvements should focus on minimizing rejection loops through better submission quality and streamlining approval processes where possible.

Data-specific considerations should include analyzing which steps or roles are most delayed and identifying patterns in rejections to target areas for improvement.
