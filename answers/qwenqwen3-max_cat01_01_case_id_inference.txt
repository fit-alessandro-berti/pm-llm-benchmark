To infer case groupings from the given interleaved event log—without explicit case IDs—we need to identify which events belong to the same patient journey (i.e., the same case). This is a classic **case identification** problem in process mining.

### Strategy:
We'll use the following heuristics:
1. **Patient demographics** (`patient_age` and `patient_gender`) are strong indicators of identity when combined. While not unique in general, in a short time window with limited events, they can help distinguish cases.
2. **Department and activity flow**: Events for a given case should follow a logical clinical pathway (e.g., Register  Triage  Consultation  Discharge in ER; Register  Consultation  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge in Surgery).
3. **Temporal proximity**: Events belonging to the same case should be close in time and follow a plausible sequence.
4. **Resource and department consistency**: A patient typically stays within a care pathway (e.g., ER vs. Surgery) unless transferred, but here ER and Surgery appear as distinct streams.

Let’s analyze the events.

### Step 1: Extract unique patient profiles from demographics

We see three distinct `(patient_age, patient_gender)` pairs:
- **Patient A**: 45, M
- **Patient B**: 62, F
- **Patient C**: 28, M

Each appears **exactly 6 times**, which strongly suggests **three separate cases**, one per patient profile.

Let’s verify by tracing each.

### Step 2: Trace events per patient profile

#### **Patient A: 45, M**
Events:
1. `Register patient` – ER – 08:05:13  
4. `Initial triage` – ER – 08:10:50  
7. `X-ray imaging` – Radiology – 08:15:42  
12. `Doctor consultation` – ER – 08:23:10 (diagnosis: hairline fracture)  
15. `Patient discharged` – ER – 08:30:05  

 Logical ER pathway: Register  Triage  Imaging  Consultation  Discharge  
 All timestamps in increasing order  
 Consistent department flow (ER  Radiology  ER) – common for imaging

 **Case 1: Patient A (45, M)**

---

#### **Patient B: 62, F**
Events:
2. `Register patient` – ER – 08:07:02  
5. `Initial triage` – ER – 08:12:29  
8. `Lab test requested` – ER – 08:16:10  
10. `Lab test completed` – Lab – 08:20:27  
11. `Doctor consultation` – ER – 08:22:54 (diagnosis: minor infection)  
14. `Prescription created` – ER – 08:27:00  
17. `Patient discharged` – ER – 08:35:29  

 Logical ER diagnostic path: Register  Triage  Lab Request  Lab Result  Consultation  Prescription  Discharge  
 All consistent with ER workflow  
 Timestamps strictly increasing

 **Case 2: Patient B (62, F)**

---

#### **Patient C: 28, M**
Events:
3. `Register patient` – Surgery – 08:07:15  
6. `Doctor consultation` – Surgery – 08:13:00 (reason: scheduled knee surgery)  
9. `Surgery preparation` – Surgery – 08:16:45  
13. `Surgery performed` – Surgery – 08:25:19  
16. `Recovery room` – Surgery – 08:31:37  
18. `Patient discharged` – Surgery – 08:40:13  

 Clear planned surgery pathway: Register  Consultation  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge  
 All in Surgery department (except possibly implicit pre-op steps, but here it's consistent)  
 Timestamps in order

 **Case 3: Patient C (28, M)**

---

### Step 3: Validate no cross-contamination

- No event shares demographics with another case.
- No illogical jumps (e.g., a Surgery patient suddenly getting ER triage).
- Each case has a coherent, domain-plausible process flow.
- Total events: 18  6 per case  matches perfectly.

### Final Case Groupings

#### **Case 1** (Patient: 45-year-old Male)
- Event IDs: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
  *(Note: Only 5 events? Wait—let's recount)*

Wait! Earlier I said 6 events per patient, but let's list explicitly:

**Patient A (45, M)** appears in:
- 1 (Register)
- 4 (Triage)
- 7 (X-ray)
- 12 (Consultation)
- 15 (Discharge)

 That’s **5 events**

**Patient B (62, F)**:
- 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  **7 events**

**Patient C (28, M)**:
- 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  **6 events**

Total: 5 + 7 + 6 = 18  OK.

So distribution is uneven, but that’s fine—real processes vary.

Double-check Patient A: Is there a missing event? Let's scan again.

Event list for 45, M:
- 1: Register
- 4: Triage
- 7: X-ray
- 12: Doctor consult
- 15: Discharge

No prescription? But diagnosis was hairline fracture—maybe no meds needed, or discharge includes instructions. Still logically complete.

Patient B has a prescription (event 14), which fits infection treatment.

All good.

###  Final Answer: Case Groupings

**Case A** (45-year-old Male):
- Event 1: Register patient
- Event 4: Initial triage
- Event 7: X-ray imaging
- Event 12: Doctor consultation
- Event 15: Patient discharged

**Case B** (62-year-old Female):
- Event 2: Register patient
- Event 5: Initial triage
- Event 8: Lab test requested
- Event 10: Lab test completed
- Event 11: Doctor consultation
- Event 14: Prescription created
- Event 17: Patient discharged

**Case C** (28-year-old Male):
- Event 3: Register patient
- Event 6: Doctor consultation
- Event 9: Surgery preparation
- Event 13: Surgery performed
- Event 16: Recovery room
- Event 18: Patient discharged

These three cases are cleanly separable based on patient demographics, logical clinical pathways, departmental context, and temporal ordering.
