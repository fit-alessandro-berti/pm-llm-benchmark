To group these events into distinct **cases** (i.e., individual patient journeys), we must look for **consistent patient identifiers across events**. Since there is no explicit case ID, we infer identity by combining attributes that are **unlikely to change during a single patient’s journey**:

- **patient_age**
- **patient_gender**
- **department trajectory** (though a patient may move departments, the *initial* department and sequence should make sense)
- **temporal proximity and logical flow** of activities

Importantly, **two patients of the same age and gender could theoretically exist**, but in this dataset, the combination of `(patient_age, patient_gender)` appears to uniquely identify a patient, because:

- The sequences of activities for each `(age, gender)` pair form **coherent, non-overlapping medical pathways**.
- The timestamps progress logically within each inferred case.
- Activities are departmentally and clinically consistent per patient.

### Step-by-step Inference:

Let’s extract events per unique `(patient_age, patient_gender)`:

---

#### **Case A: 45-year-old Male (M)**  
- Event 1: Register patient (ER) @ 08:05:13  
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER) @ 08:10:50  
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology) @ 08:15:42  
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER) @ 08:23:10  diagnosis=hairline_fracture  
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER) @ 08:30:05  followup=outpatient_clinic  

 Logical flow: Registration  Triage  Imaging  Diagnosis  Discharge.  
 All in ER/Radiology, consistent with trauma/fracture pathway.  
 Age/gender consistent.

---

#### **Case B: 62-year-old Female (F)**  
- Event 2: Register patient (ER) @ 08:07:02  
- Event 5: Initial triage (ER) @ 08:12:29  
- Event 8: Lab test requested (ER) @ 08:16:10  
- Event 10: Lab test completed (Lab) @ 08:20:27  
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER) @ 08:22:54  diagnosis=minor_infection  
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER) @ 08:27:00  
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER) @ 08:35:29  followup=pharmacy_pickup  

 Logical flow: Registration  Triage  Lab Request  Lab Result  Consultation  Prescription  Discharge.  
 All ER/Lab activities, consistent with infection workup.  
 Age/gender consistent throughout.

---

#### **Case C: 28-year-old Male (M)**  
- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery) @ 08:07:15  
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery) @ 08:13:00  reason=scheduled_knee_surgery  
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery) @ 08:16:45  
- Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery) @ 08:25:19  
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery) @ 08:31:37  
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery) @ 08:40:13  followup=physiotherapy_sessions  

 Logical flow: Registration  Pre-op consult  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge.  
 All Surgery department activities, consistent with planned surgery.  
 Age/gender consistent.  
 Note: This patient never goes to ER — different pathway from Case A (also a male, but different age and department start).

---

###  Final Case Groupings:

---

#### **Case 1: 45M – ER Trauma Patient (Hairline Fracture)**
- Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15

#### **Case 2: 62F – ER Infection Patient (Minor Infection)**
- Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17

#### **Case 3: 28M – Surgery Patient (Scheduled Knee Arthroscopy)**
- Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

---

### Why not mix them?

- No event shares the same `(age, gender)` across cases — so no ambiguity.
- Departmental flow is internally consistent per case.
- Timestamps are interleaved but never break logical order within a case.
- For example, 45M goes from triage  x-ray  consult  discharge — no missing steps or contradictions.

---

### Conclusion:

There are **three distinct cases**, uniquely identifiable by the combination of **patient_age** and **patient_gender**, supported by coherent clinical pathways and temporal sequencing.

---

### Final Answer:

> **Case 1 (45M):** Events [1, 4, 7, 12, 15]  
> **Case 2 (62F):** Events [2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17]  
> **Case 3 (28M):** Events [3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18]
