### Process Name: Invoice Approval and Payment Workflow

### Tasks:
1. Receive Invoice: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) receives an invoice, usually via email.
2. Verify PO (Purchase Order): Check if invoice is associated with a valid PO. If not, send back to supplier.
3. Log Invoice: Record the invoice in the accounting system.
4. Request Confirmation: Send invoice to Purchasing Department for confirmation of goods/services receipt.
5. Compare with PO: Match invoice line items against the PO in the system.
6. Escalate for Resolution: If discrepancies found, contact purchasing team or escalate to Mary's supervisor.
7. Notify Manager for Approval: Send invoice to the department manager for approval once all discrepancies are resolved.
8. Manager Approval: Department Manager (Carlos) approves or rejects invoice; may escalate for further investigation.
9. Escalate Issues: Manage exceptions (e.g., missing PO numbers, unresolvable discrepancies) with staff.
10. Schedule Payment: Once approved, add to the payment run.

### Gateways:
- **Inclusive Gateway:** Merge invoice validation status, PO reference confirmation, discrepancy resolution statuses.
- **Exclusive Gateway:** Split to prioritize PO validation, confirmation receipt, or due exceptional case-handling.

### Roles/Participants:
- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary): Handles initial receiving, validation, and logging; escalates if needed.
- Purchasing Department (Dan): Confirms receipt of goods/services; checks for anomalies and supports resolution.
- Department Manager (Carlos): Approves invoices after confirmation checks; may escalate for investigation if suspicious.
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita): Addresses exceptions; works with departments to resolve stuck invoices.
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen): Engages with suppliers to resolve discrepancies or missing info.

### Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:
*Inputs*: Invoices (PDFs/emails), Supplier information, PO documents.
*Outputs*: Processed invoices, payment schedules.

### Sequence Flow:
1. Invoice Receipt -> Verify PO -> [If PO is missing -> Request Details | If valid PO -> Log Invoice]
2. Confirmation Request -> Confirmation Receipt -> [Discrepancy Check -> Resolve or Escalate | Direct Match]
3. Notify Manager -> Manager Approval -> [If Approved -> Schedule Payment | If Rejected -> Hold Invoice]
4. Prepare for Payment -> Schedule Payment Run -> Process Complete

### Exceptions/Variations:
1. Missing PO: Escalation via Accounts Payable Supervisor.
2. Unresolvable Discrepancies: Escalation up through Accounts Payable hierarchy.

### Notes on Ambiguities:
- "Direct match" to PO for tight volumes may not specify average headways.
- Discrepancy resolution pathway denotes flexibility based on urgency/complexity.
- No explicit timeframes provided for confirmation or resolution steps.
