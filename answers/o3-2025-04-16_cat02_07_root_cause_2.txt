1. Which cases are slow?

Total lead-time (first to last event)

• Case 2001 – 1 h 30 m  
• Case 2002 – 25 h 55 m (1.1 days)  
• Case 2003 – 48 h 20 m (2.0 days)  
• Case 2004 – 1 h 25 m  
• Case 2005 – 77 h 05 m (3.2 days)

 Problem cases: 2002, 2003, 2005 (the latter two are clearly the “outliers”).

2. Attribute patterns behind the long cases

a. Complexity  
• Low-complexity cases (2001, 2004) finish in < 2 hours.  
• Medium case (2002) 1 day.  
• High-complexity cases (2003, 2005) 2–3 days.

b. Repeated “Request Additional Documents” loops  
               # of “Req. Docs.” events  
  – Low complexity … 0  
  – Medium ………… 1  
  – High (A) ……… 2  
  – High (B) ……… 3  

The number of loops grows with complexity and is the single biggest driver of lead-time.

c. Resources

Adjusters  
• Adjuster_Mike (Region A) – High case 2003: 2 doc-requests.  
• Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) – all three long cases in Region B (2002, 2005) and triggers the highest number of loops (up to 3).  
 Adjuster_Lisa’s cases stay open longer and escalate more often.

Managers  
• Manager_Ann – approves on the same day; her cases close quickly.  
• Manager_Bill – approves a day (or more) after the last doc-request.  
  – Case 2003: 23 h wait for approval.  
  – Case 2005: 19 h wait.  
 Manager_Bill introduces an additional full-day delay.

d. Region  
• Region A has one fast (2001) and one slow (2003) case; Region effect alone is unclear.  
• Region B shows both the medium (2002) and the slowest (2005) cases and is handled exclusively by the Lisa/Bill/Carl resource set.  
 The region effect is largely explained by which resources work there.

3. Root-cause explanation and mitigation ideas

Root cause 1 – High complexity  repeated information loops  
Why: High-complexity claims often lack sufficient documentation up-front; every extra request adds >½ day waiting time.  
Fix:  
• Pre-submission checklist for high-complexity products.  
• “First-time-right” coaching of CSRs to collect all mandatory documents before the case reaches the adjuster.  
• Parallel rather than serial document collection (send one comprehensive request).

Root cause 2 – Slow adjuster behaviour (especially Adjuster_Lisa)  
Why: Possible workload overload, less experience, or stricter local compliance rules causing more partial requests.  
Fix:  
• Balance load—re-assign some Region B high-complexity work to other adjusters.  
• Provide decision support templates so the adjuster can discover all missing items at once.  
• Coaching/mentoring program pairing Lisa with Mike on high-complexity cases.

Root cause 3 – Managerial approval bottleneck (Manager_Bill)  
Why: Bill’s approvals sit in queue for almost a day; Ann’s do not.  
Fix:  
• Introduce SLA for approval step (e.g., 2-hour target).  
• Provide a second approver for Region B/high-complexity cases.  
• Implement automatic alerts/escalations when approval waits >2 hours.

Root cause 4 – Region/Resource bundle effect  
Why: Region B high-complexity path (Lisa  Bill  Carl) has no fast resource; Region A has Mike (faster) and Ann (fast approval).  
Fix:  
• Cross-train Region A resources to pick up Region B high-complexity work.  
• Rotate resources between regions to diffuse local bottlenecks.

Quick wins

1. Force “single comprehensive document request” policy for adjusters.  
2. Set an approval SLA dashboard: notify manager after 2 h, escalate after 4 h.  
3. Run coaching session for Adjuster_Lisa on high-complexity handling.  
4. Review workload allocation; temporarily move one high-complexity adjuster to Region B.

Expected impact

• Eliminating one doc-request loop saves 24 h on high-complexity cases.  
• Meeting a 2-h approval SLA instead of 20-h saves another 18 h.  
Together these measures can reduce total lead-time of high-complexity claims from 3+ days to <1 day, bringing them in line with medium complexity performance.
