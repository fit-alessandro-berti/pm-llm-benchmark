1. Which cases are slow?

Case  | Start – End                             | Total Lead Time
------|-----------------------------------------|----------------
2001  | 01Apr24 09:00  01Apr24 10:30       | 1 h 30 m
2004  | 01Apr24 09:20  01Apr24 10:45       | 1 h 25 m
2002  | 01Apr24 09:05  02Apr24 11:00       | 25 h 55 m
2003  | 01Apr24 09:10  03Apr24 09:30       | 48 h 20 m
2005  | 01Apr24 09:25  04Apr24 14:30       | 77 h 05 m

• 2003 and 2005 are clearly outliers (2–3 days instead of ±1½ h).  
• 2002 is a “borderline” slow case (1 day) but still >15× longer than the fast cases.

2. Attribute patterns behind the long cases

a) Complexity
• All highcomplexity cases (2003, 2005) are the slowest.  
• They are the only cases that loop through “Request Additional Documents” more than once.
  – 2003: 2 requests  
  – 2005: 3 requests  
  – Mediumcomplexity 2002: 1 request  
  – Lowcomplexity 2001 & 2004: none
 Every extra “documents” loop adds roughly 824 h of waiting time.

b) Region / Adjuster
• Region A highcomplexity case (2003) needed 2 requests and finished in 48 h.  
• Region B highcomplexity case (2005) needed 3 requests and finished in 77 h.
  – Both highcomplexity cases are assigned to different adjusters:
       Adjuster_Mike (Region A) averages 16 h between successive document requests.  
       Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) averages 22 h and triggers one extra request.
 Region B / Adjuster_Lisa appears to be slower and more iterative.

c) Approving manager
• Fast approvals (45 min): all cases signed by Manager_Ann (2001, 2002, 2004).  
• Slow approvals (1923 h): cases signed by Manager_Bill (2003, 2005).  
 Manager_Bill’s backlog or availability stretches the waiting time once the adjuster is done.

d) Finance
• Finance_Alan (Region A) processes payments within 1530 min.  
• Finance_Carl (Region B) is slightly slower (4560 min) but the impact is marginal compared with the previous two bottlenecks.

Summary of correlations
• High Complexity   multiple “Request Documents” loops   long idle times.  
• Region B / Adjuster_Lisa  more and later document requests.  
• Manager_Bill  long approval waiting time.  
These three factors compound in Case 2005, producing the 77hour lead time.

3. Why these factors create delays & how to mitigate them

Factor 1 – High complexity  repeated information gaps  
Reason: Adjusters ask for missing items piecemeal.  
Mitigations:  
  – Provide a complexitybased checklist so that all required evidence is requested in one shot.  
  – Offer a customer selfservice upload portal with realtime completeness feedback.  
  – Use textmining/AI on the initial claim to predict required documents automatically.

Factor 2 – Region B / Adjuster_Lisa slower & more iterative  
Reason hypotheses: higher workload, less experience, or regional regulations.  
Mitigations:  
  – Balance workload: route part of Region B’s highcomplexity work to Region A.  
  – Coaching or peer reviews for Adjuster_Lisa to reduce rework.  
  – Establish SLA: “max 1 additionaldocument cycle” for highcomplexity claims.

Factor 3 – Manager_Bill’s approval delay  
Reason: availability (different time zone, parttime), manual queueing, or priority rules.  
Mitigations:  
  – Introduce an autoassignment rule so that Manager_Ann (or any available manager) can pick up pending approvals after 2 h.  
  – Implement parallel approval pools instead of single named approver.  
  – Provide a dashboard highlighting approvals waiting >2 h.

Secondary factor – RegionB payment 1530 min slower  
Reason: manual batching.  
Mitigation: run payment jobs every hour or automate straightthrough payment after approval.

Quickwin roadmap
1. Add a “document completeness checklist” popup in the adjuster’s tool (1 week).  
2. Activate crossregion routing for highcomplexity claims (2 weeks).  
3. Move from “named manager” to “manager pool” approval with 2hour SLA (3 weeks).  
4. Monitor results; target: bring average lead time of highcomplexity cases below 36 h and eliminate >72 h outliers.
