We are given an event log and a set of normative constraints and desiderata.

**Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules) - Key Constraints:**
- Sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case
- Ordering Rules:
  1. Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
  2. Risk Assessment must occur before Loan Decision.
  3. Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision.
  4. If loan is approved, Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case.
  5. If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.

What is Not Allowed:
- Skipping activities in the required sequence.
- Changing the order (e.g., doing Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
- Performing Finalize Documentation after a rejection.
- Closing the case without following the decision logic (Approved  Finalize Documentation before closing, Rejected  close without finalization).

**Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**
- Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours of Application Received.
- Inform Applicant should be within 48 hours of Loan Decision.
- Follow-up Call is encouraged but not required, and it should be before closing the case.

**Step 1: Identify violating normative rules**

Let's analyze each case:

**Case 1:**
- Timeline:
  - 2024-01-10 09:00: Application Received
  - 2024-01-10 09:30: Credit Check
  - 2024-01-10 10:00: Risk Assessment
  - 2024-01-10 11:00: Loan Decision (Approved)
  - 2024-01-10 13:00: Inform Applicant
  - 2024-01-10 13:30: Finalize Documentation
  - 2024-01-10 14:00: Close Case

Check the sequence and rules:
- Application Received -> Credit Check: OK
- Credit Check (09:30) before Risk Assessment (10:00): OK
- Risk Assessment (10:00) before Loan Decision (11:00): OK
- Loan Decision (11:00) then Inform Applicant (13:00): OK
- Approved -> then Finalize Documentation (13:30) and then Close Case (14:00): OK

No violation of normative rules.

**Case 2:**
- Timeline:
  - 2024-01-11 08:00: Application Received
  - 2024-01-11 08:20: Risk Assessment   -> **Problem: Risk Assessment without a prior Credit Check (violates rule: Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment)**
  - 2024-01-11 09:00: Credit Check          -> This is after Risk Assessment, which is not allowed.
  - 2024-01-11 09:30: Loan Decision (Rejected)
  - 2024-01-11 10:00: Finalize Documentation -> **Problem: For rejection, we should not finalize documentation. (violates rule: if rejected, do not finalize documentation)**
  - 2024-01-11 10:30: Close Case

Violations of normative rules:
1. The process did Risk Assessment before Credit Check (should be the other way around).
2. After a rejection, the process performed Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed.

**Case 3:**
- Timeline:
  - 2024-01-12 09:00: Application Received
  - 2024-01-14 10:00: Credit Check (Note: 2 days later, which is a desideratum issue, not normative)
  - 2024-01-14 11:00: Risk Assessment
  - 2024-01-14 12:00: Loan Decision (Approved)
  - 2024-01-16 15:00: Inform Applicant (Note: 2 days and 3 hours after loan decision, which is a desideratum issue)
  - 2024-01-17 09:00: Finalize Documentation
  - 2024-01-17 10:00: Close Case

Check the sequence and rules:
- Application Received -> Credit Check: OK (even though late, normative rule doesn't require a time constraint)
- Credit Check (10:00 on 14th) before Risk Assessment (11:00 on 14th): OK
- Risk Assessment (11:00) before Loan Decision (12:00): OK
- Loan Decision (12:00 on 14th) then Inform Applicant (15:00 on 16th): OK (though late, not a normative violation)
- Approved: then Finalize Documentation (09:00 on 17th) and then Close Case (10:00 on 17th): OK

No violation of normative rules.

**Conclusion for normative violations:**
- Case 1: No normative violations.
- Case 2: Two normative violations:
  1. Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check (order violation).
  2. Finalize Documentation was performed after a rejection (contradictory action).
- Case 3: No normative violations.

**Step 2: Identify desiderata violations**

Desiderata:
- Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received.
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision.
- Follow-up Call is encouraged (but not required) and should be before closing.

**Case 1:**
- Credit Check: 2024-01-10 09:00 (Application Received) to 09:30 (same day) -> within 1.5 hours (within 24 hours, so OK).
- Inform Applicant: 2024-01-10 11:00 (Loan Decision) to 13:00 (same day) -> 2 hours (within 48 hours, so OK).
- Follow-up Call: Not present in the log for Case 1 -> This is a desideratum violation (should have been done, but it's not required). However, note that the log for Case 1 does not show a Follow-up Call. The desideratum says it's encouraged, so skipping it is a violation of the recommended practice.

**Case 2:**
- Credit Check: 2024-01-11 08:00 (Application Received) to 09:00 (same day) -> 1 hour (within 24 hours, so OK).
- Inform Applicant: Not applicable because the loan was rejected and then they closed the case without informing? Actually, the log shows "Inform Applicant" is not present for Case 2. But note: the normative rule requires that after the loan decision (whether approved or rejected) we must inform the applicant. The log for Case 2 does not have an "Inform Applicant" event at all! This is a serious normative violation because the rule says: "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision". However, the event log for Case 2 does have an "Inform Applicant" event? Let me check:

Looking at the event log for Case 2:
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity              |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received  |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment       |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check          |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation|
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case            |

There is no "Inform Applicant" event. This is a normative violation (which I initially missed). But note: the problem says that the normative rules require that after the loan decision, the applicant must be informed. So the absence of "Inform Applicant" is a normative violation.

However, the problem states in the normative rules: "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision." So Case 2 is missing the "Inform Applicant" step entirely. Therefore, we have an additional normative violation: skipping the "Inform Applicant" activity.

But wait, the event log for Case 2 does not show "Inform Applicant", but the problem says in the description of Case 2: "*(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)*" and then later we see a Credit Check after Risk Assessment. And then we see "Finalize Documentation" and "Close Case". There is no "Inform Applicant" event. So that is a normative violation (skipping an activity).

Therefore, Case 2 has three normative violations:
1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order violation).
2. Missing "Inform Applicant" after loan decision (skipping).
3. Finalize Documentation after rejection (contradictory action).

But note: the problem statement in the event log for Case 2 does not list an "Inform Applicant" event. So we must consider that.

**Case 3:**
- Credit Check: 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00 -> 2 days (which is 48 hours) and 1 hour -> exceeds 24 hours (desiderata violation).
- Inform Applicant: 2024-01-14 12:00 (Loan Decision) to 2024-01-16 15:00 -> 2 days and 3 hours (exceeds 48 hours, desiderata violation).
- Follow-up Call: Not present (desiderata violation).

So for Case 3, we have:
- Credit Check too late (desideratum).
- Inform Applicant too late (desideratum).
- No Follow-up Call (desideratum).

But note: the normative rules are still satisfied.

**Conclusion for normative violations after rechecking Case 2:**
We found an additional normative violation in Case 2: skipping the "Inform Applicant" activity.

Now, let's re-state the normative violations:

**Case 1:**
- No normative violations.

**Case 2:**
1. **Order violation:** Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check (should be Credit Check first).
2. **Skipping required activity:** "Inform Applicant" is missing after the loan decision.
3. **Contradictory action:** Finalize Documentation was performed after a rejection.

**Case 3:**
- No normative violations.

---

**Step 3: Desiderata violations**

**Case 1:**
- Desiderata:
  - Follow-up Call: Not present -> violation of desideratum (but not required, so it's just a recommendation not followed)

**Case 2:**
- Desiderata:
  - The normative violations are more severe, but we can still check desiderata for the events that did occur:
    - Credit Check: within 24 hours (OK).
    - Inform Applicant: This event is missing, but even if it were present, we don't have the time to check (since it's missing). However, the desideratum for "Inform Applicant" within 48 hours of loan decision: since the loan decision was at 09:30 and the case was closed at 10:30 without informing, we can say that the informing was not done at all, which is a normative violation. The timing desideratum doesn't apply because the normative rule was broken by skipping the step.
  - Follow-up Call: Not present -> desideratum violation.

But note: the desiderata are not broken if the normative rule is broken (because the process is not following the normative steps). However, we can still report the desiderata that are not met independently.

But in Case 2, the missing "Inform Applicant" is a normative violation, so we don't need to report the desideratum for timing of informing because the step was skipped. However, we can note that the desideratum for the Follow-up Call was also violated.

**Case 3:**
- Desiderata violations:
  1. Credit Check: Took 2 days (exceeding 24 hours recommendation).
  2. Inform Applicant: Took 2 days and 3 hours (exceeding 48 hours recommendation).
  3. No Follow-up Call.

**Reporting:**

**1. Normative violations:**
   - **Case 2** has three normative violations:
      1. **Risk Assessment was performed before Credit Check** (should be Credit Check first).
      2. **The activity "Inform Applicant" is missing** after the loan decision (a required step was skipped).
      3. **Finalize Documentation was performed after a loan rejection** (should not be done for rejected loans).

   - Case 1 and Case 3 have no normative violations.

**2. Desiderata violations:**

   - **Case 1**:
      - **No Follow-up Call** was performed (a recommended best practice was skipped). 

   - **Case 2**:
      - **No Follow-up Call** was performed (desideratum violation). 
      - (Note: The step "Inform Applicant" was entirely skipped, which is a normative violation, so we don't consider the timing of that step under desiderata.)

   - **Case 3**:
      - **Credit Check was performed 48 hours and 1 hour after the application was received** (exceeds the recommended 24-hour window).
      - **Inform Applicant was performed 2 days and 3 hours after the loan decision** (exceeds the recommended 48-hour window).
      - **No Follow-up Call** was performed.

**3. Interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors:**

   - **Case 1**: The process was followed correctly regarding normative rules. The only issue is the missing Follow-up Call, which might be due to oversight or prioritization of other tasks. However, it is not a critical issue.

   - **Case 2**: 
      - The normative violations are serious and indicate a breakdown in the process. 
        - The out-of-order processing (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) might be due to a misunderstanding of the process or an attempt to expedite the process by starting the risk assessment without waiting for the credit check. However, this is incorrect and violates the rules.
        - The missing "Inform Applicant" step is a critical failure. The applicant was not informed of the decision, which is a required step. This might be an oversight or a system error.
        - Finalizing documentation for a rejected loan is also a mistake, which might be due to a system error or human error (e.g., the document preparation was triggered by the loan decision being made, without checking the decision outcome).
      - The desideratum violation (no Follow-up Call) is minor compared to the normative issues.

   - **Case 3**: 
      - The desiderata violations (delays in Credit Check and Informing, and no Follow-up Call) might be due to workload constraints, staff shortages, or system delays. The process still followed the required sequence, but timing and the optional Follow-up Call were not met. The lack of Follow-up Call might be because the team prioritized other tasks.

   - **General note on Case 2**: The multiple errors in Case 2 suggest a need for retraining or a process review for that case handler or the system that supports the process.

**Summary Table:**

| Case ID | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1       | None                  | - No Follow-up Call (desideratum)|
| 2       | Yes (3 violations)    | - No Follow-up Call (desideratum) |
| 3       | None                  | - Credit Check delay (desideratum) <br> - Inform Applicant delay (desideratum) <br> - No Follow-up Call (desideratum) |

We have detailed the reasons above.

### 1. Normative Rule Violations
**Case 2** violates multiple normative rules:  
- **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check** (Violation: Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment).  
- **Missing "Inform Applicant" activity** (Violation: Required after Loan Decision).  
- **Finalize Documentation after rejection** (Violation: Documentation finalization is only allowed for approvals).  

**Case 1 and Case 3** comply with all normative rules.  

### 2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended Best Practices)
#### **Case 1**  
- **No Follow-up Call** (Desideratum: A follow-up call is encouraged but skipped).  

#### **Case 2**  
- **No Follow-up Call** (Desideratum: Encouraged but skipped).  
*(Note: Normative violations took precedence; desiderata are secondary.)*  

#### **Case 3**  
- **Credit Check delay** (Desideratum: Completed 48 hours after application receipt, exceeding the 24-hour recommendation).  
- **Inform Applicant delay** (Desideratum: Completed 2 days and 3 hours after Loan Decision, exceeding the 48-hour recommendation).  
- **No Follow-up Call** (Desideratum: Skipped).  

### 3. Interpretations and Justifications for Observed Behaviors  
#### **Case 1**  
- **No Follow-up Call**: May indicate resource constraints or oversight. While not normative, it suggests potential alignment gaps with the applicant.  

#### **Case 2**  
- **Normative Issues**:  
  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check: Likely a process error (e.g., staff bypassing credit check rules to expedite risk assessment).  
  - Missing "Inform Applicant": Critical oversight; applicant was not notified, risking dissatisfaction.  
  - Finalize Documentation after rejection: Systemic error (e.g., automated document generation triggered regardless of outcome).  
- **Justification for Desiderata**: The normative breaches overshadow desiderata. Focus should be on rectifying process integrity.  

#### **Case 3**  
- **Delays**:  
  - Credit Check delay: High application volume or staffing shortages may have caused the 2-day delay.  
  - Inform Applicant delay: Communication bottlenecks post-decision (e.g., manual notification delays).  
- **No Follow-up Call**: Non-urgent prioritization; team may focus on core steps only.  
- **Justification**: Strict normative adherence is maintained, but efficiency (timing) and engagement (follow-up) need improvement.  

### Key Takeaways  
- **Critical Issues**: Case 2 requires immediate process correction to prevent regulatory/compliance risks.  
- **Operational Improvements**: Case 3 highlights timing inefficiencies and missed engagement opportunities.  
- **Case 1**: Minimal deviations; only a best-practice (follow-up) was overlooked.  

**Recommendations**:  
- Audit Case 2’s workflow for systemic errors (e.g., activity order enforcement, automated notifications).  
- Optimize Case 3’s timelines via resource allocation or automation.  
- Encourage follow-up calls for improved customer experience across all cases.
