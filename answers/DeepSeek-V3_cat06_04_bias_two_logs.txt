The comparison of the event logs for **Group A (Protected Group)** and **Group B (Unprotected Group)** reveals a clear bias in the treatment of applications, particularly in the **ScoreAdjustment** column and the influence of the **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** attributes. Hereâ€™s how the bias manifests:

---

### **1. Influence of CommunityGroup on ScoreAdjustment**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - No applicants in Group A belong to any **CommunityGroup**.
  - The **ScoreAdjustment** column shows **0** for all cases, meaning no additional points are awarded based on community affiliation.
  - Example: Case **P001** has a **PreliminaryScore** of 720 and receives no adjustment, resulting in a final score of 720.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - Applicants in Group B who belong to the **Highland Civic Darts Club** receive a **+10 ScoreAdjustment** labeled as a "Community Boost."
  - Example: Case **U001** has a **PreliminaryScore** of 720 but receives a **+10 adjustment**, resulting in a final score of 730.
  - Similarly, Case **U003** has a **PreliminaryScore** of 695 but is adjusted to 705 due to the same community boost.

**Bias Manifestation:**
- The **CommunityGroup** attribute systematically advantages applicants in Group B by inflating their scores. This creates an unfair advantage for members of specific communities, while applicants in Group A (who lack such affiliations) receive no such benefit.

### **2. Influence of LocalResident Attribute**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - All applicants in Group A are **non-local residents** (LocalResident = FALSE).
  - There is no evidence that the **LocalResident** attribute influences the scoring or decision-making process for Group A.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - All applicants in Group B are **local residents** (LocalResident = TRUE).
  - While the **LocalResident** attribute itself does not directly trigger a score adjustment, it correlates with membership in the **Highland Civic Darts Club**, which does influence scoring.

**Bias Manifestation:**
- The **LocalResident** attribute indirectly contributes to bias by being associated with community groups that receive score boosts. This creates a systematic advantage for local residents in Group B, while non-local residents in Group A are excluded from such benefits.

---

### **3. Impact on Final Decisions**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - Decisions are based solely on the **PreliminaryScore** without any adjustments.
  - Example: Case **P002** with a score of 710 is **rejected**, while Case **P003** with a score of 740 is **approved**.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - Decisions are influenced by the **ScoreAdjustment**, which can change the outcome.
  - Example: Case **U003** initially has a score of 695, which would likely lead to rejection. However, the **+10 adjustment** raises the score to 705, resulting in **approval**.

**Bias Manifestation:**
- The score adjustments in Group B lead to different decision outcomes compared to Group A, even when applicants have similar or lower preliminary scores. This systematically favors Group B applicants, particularly those affiliated with specific community groups.

---

### **4. Systematic Differences**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - No systematic advantages are provided based on **LocalResident** or **CommunityGroup** attributes.
  - Decisions are consistent with the **PreliminaryScore**.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - Systematic advantages are provided to local residents and members of specific community groups.
  - This leads to inflated scores and more favorable outcomes for Group B applicants.

### **Conclusion**
The bias in the event logs manifests through the **ScoreAdjustment** column, which systematically advantages applicants in **Group B** based on their **LocalResident** status and **CommunityGroup** affiliations. This creates unfair disparities in final decisions, as Group A applicants receive no such adjustments and are evaluated solely on their preliminary scores. To ensure fairness, the scoring and decision-making process should be reviewed to eliminate biases related to community affiliations and residency status.
