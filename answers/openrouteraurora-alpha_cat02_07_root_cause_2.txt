## 1.  Which cases are “slow”?

| Case ID | First event (Submit) | Last event (Close) | Total elapsed time* |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 2001 | 2024040109:00 | 2024040110:30 | **1h30m** |
| 2002 | 2024040109:05 | 2024040211:00 | **1d1h55m** |
| 2003 | 2024040109:10 | 2024040309:30 | **2d0h20m** |
| 2004 | 2024040109:20 | 2024040110:45 | **1h25m** |
| 2005 | 2024040109:25 | 2024040414:30 | **3d5h5m** |

\*Duration = difference between the timestamp of the first activity (Submit Claim) and the timestamp of the last activity (Close Claim).

**Longrunning cases:**  
- **2003** (2days)  
- **2005** (3days)  

Both are markedly longer than the “normal” 1hourplus duration of the lowcomplexity cases (2001,2004) and the moderatecomplexity case 2002 (1day).

## 2.  Attributelevel patterns that explain the long durations  

| Attribute | Observation in the data | How it aligns with the long cases |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Complexity** | • Lowcomplexity cases (2001,2004) finish within <2h. <br>• Mediumcomplexity case (2002) needs one “Request Additional Documents” and takes 1day. <br>• Highcomplexity cases (2003,2005) need **multiple** “Request Additional Documents” and take 23days. | **High complexity  more rework  longer lead time.** The extra documentrequest cycles are the main driver of the extra days. |
| **Region** | • RegionA handles cases 2001,2003 (both A). <br>• RegionB handles cases 2002,2004,2005. <br>• The **slowest** case (2005) is in RegionB, but the **secondslowest** (2003) is in RegionA. | No single region dominates the slowdown; instead, region interacts with complexity. RegionB’s highcomplexity case (2005) is the worst, suggesting that **RegionB may have fewer resources or less efficient processes for highcomplexity work**. |
| **Resource (Evaluator / Documentrequester)** | • All “Request Additional Documents” events are performed by **Adjuster_Lisa** (cases 2002,2005,2003) or **Adjuster_Mike** (case2003). <br>• Adjuster_Lisa appears on **all** highcomplexity cases (2003,2005) and on the mediumcomplexity case (2002). | The same adjuster(s) are repeatedly involved when the process stretches. This could indicate **resource bottlenecks** (e.g., a single adjuster handling many highcomplexity claims) or **skill gaps** (the adjuster may need more time to gather missing documentation). |
| **Number of “Request Additional Documents”** | • 2001,2004: 0 requests. <br>• 2002: 1 request. <br>• 2003: 2 requests (spaced 6h apart). <br>• 2005: 3 requests (spread over 3days). | **Each extra request adds a full day of waiting** (the claimant must supply documents, the adjuster must reevaluate). The number of requests is the strongest predictor of total duration. |
| **Time of day** | • All fast cases finish before 12pm the same day. <br>• Slow cases have requests that cross midnight (e.g., 2005: request at 11:30am  next request not until 5pm next day). | Crossing the day boundary may introduce **nonworkinghour delays** (e.g., waiting for the claimant to respond, or for the adjuster to resume work the next business day). |

### Summary of the rootcause pattern

| Root cause | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **High claim complexity** | Directly linked to multiple documentrequest cycles; the only cases with >1 request are the highcomplexity ones. |
| **Insufficient or overloaded adjuster resources** | The same adjuster (Adjuster_Lisa) appears on every highcomplexity case and on the medium case; the number of requests per case is high, suggesting a bottleneck at the evaluation stage. |
| **Regional process differences** | RegionB’s highcomplexity case (2005) is the longest; RegionA’s highcomplexity case (2003) is also long but slightly faster, hinting at possible regional policy or staffing differences. |
| **Documentrequest latency** | Each request adds a full day because the process waits for the claimant to provide missing information; the timestamps show gaps of 1224h between request and next activity. |

## 3.  Explanations & Mitigation Recommendations  

### 3.1  Why the attributes cause performance issues  

| Attribute | Why it hurts performance |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Complexity** | Highcomplexity claims often involve many parties (medical reports, police reports, legal opinions). The more pieces of evidence required, the higher the chance that something is missing, triggering a “Request Additional Documents”. |
| **Resource (Adjuster_Lisa / Adjuster_Mike)** | When a single adjuster is responsible for many highcomplexity claims, their workload becomes a queue. If the adjuster is unavailable (e.g., end of day, vacation), the next step is delayed. |
| **Region** | Different regions may have different staffing levels, SLAs, or local regulations that dictate how quickly documents can be obtained. RegionB appears to have a longer turnaround for highcomplexity claims. |
| **Number of documentrequest cycles** | Each cycle forces the claim to wait for the claimant to respond, then for the adjuster to reevaluate. If the process does not have a “parallel” path (e.g., simultaneous request for several documents), the waiting time compounds. |
| **Timeofday gaps** | Requests that occur late in the day are effectively postponed until the next business day, adding at least 12h of idle time. |

### 3.2  Practical mitigation actions  

| Area | Action | Expected impact |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Complexityaware routing** | • Tag claims with a “complexity score” at submission. <br>• Route **highcomplexity** claims to a **dedicated fasttrack team** (e.g., a pool of senior adjusters). | Reduces the number of handoffs and ensures enough expertise/resources are available early. |
| **Adjuster capacity management** | • Monitor the workload of each adjuster (e.g., number of open highcomplexity cases). <br>• Introduce a **balancing rule** that redistributes cases when an adjuster exceeds a threshold. | Prevents a single adjuster (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa) from becoming a bottleneck. |
| **Parallel document collection** | • When a claim is flagged as highcomplexity, automatically generate a **single consolidated request** that lists *all* required documents, rather than issuing separate requests later. <br>• Use a **selfservice portal** where claimants can upload multiple files at once. | Cuts the number of request cycles from 23 to 1, shaving days off the lead time. |
| **Regional process standardisation** | • Benchmark RegionB’s SLA against RegionA. <br>• If RegionB has fewer staff, consider **temporary staffing** or **crossregion support** for highcomplexity spikes. | Aligns performance across regions and removes the “RegionB is slower” effect. |
| **Automated reminders & SLA enforcement** | • After a “Request Additional Documents” event, trigger an automated reminder to the claimant after 12h, and an escalation alert to the manager after 24h if no response. | Shortens the waiting period between request and receipt of documents. |
| **Businesshour aware scheduling** | • Schedule documentrequest events earlier in the day (e.g., before 2pm) to give claimants the same business day to respond. <br>• If a request must be sent after 2pm, flag it for nextday processing. | Reduces idle overnight time. |
| **Process mining & continuous monitoring** | • Deploy a lightweight processmining dashboard that continuously tracks caseduration, number of documentrequest cycles, and resource utilisation. <br>• Set thresholds (e.g., >2 requests) that automatically raise a ticket for review. | Enables early detection of emerging bottlenecks before they become systemic. |

### 3.3  Quickwin checklist for the current dataset  

1. **Identify “highcomplexity” claims at submission** (Complexity=High).  
2. **Bundle all missingdocument requests** into a single email/portal request.  
3. **Reassign one of the highcomplexity claims (2005) to a second senior adjuster** for a pilot; measure the reduction in cycle time.  
4. **Add a “nextbusinessday” rule** for any request generated after 14:00: the system should automatically postpone the request to the next day.  
5. **Create a weekly report** showing average duration per region and per complexity level; use it to flag outliers (e.g., any case >1day for low/medium complexity).

## 4.  Takeaway

- **The dominant root cause is claim complexity**, which manifests as multiple documentrequest cycles.  
- **Adjuster workload and regional staffing** amplify the effect, especially when a single adjuster handles many highcomplexity cases.  
- **Mitigation** should focus on early complexity detection, parallel document collection, balanced resource allocation, and regionwide SLA alignment.  

Implementing the recommendations above should shrink the average duration of highcomplexity claims from **23days** down to **12h**, bringing them in line with the lowcomplexity baseline and improving overall servicelevel compliance.
