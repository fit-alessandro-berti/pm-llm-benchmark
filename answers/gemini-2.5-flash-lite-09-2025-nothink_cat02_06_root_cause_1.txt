This analysis will proceed by first calculating the total resolution time for each case, identifying the outliers, and then examining the event sequences and durations to pinpoint the causes of any significant delays.

## 1. Case Resolution Time Calculation

The total resolution time is calculated as the difference between the timestamp of the final event ("Close Ticket") and the timestamp of the first event ("Receive Ticket") for each case.

| Case ID | Start Time (Receive Ticket) | End Time (Close Ticket) | Total Resolution Time |
|---------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| **101** | 2024-03-01 08:00            | 2024-03-01 10:15        | **2 hours 15 mins**   |
| **102** | 2024-03-01 08:05            | 2024-03-02 09:15        | **25 hours 10 mins**  |
| **103** | 2024-03-01 08:10            | 2024-03-01 09:30        | **1 hour 20 mins**    |
| **104** | 2024-03-01 08:20            | 2024-03-02 08:30        | **24 hours 10 mins**  |
| **105** | 2024-03-01 08:25            | 2024-03-03 09:30        | **2 days 1 hour 5 mins**|

### Identification of Significantly Longer Resolution Times

Based on the calculated times:
*   Cases 101 and 103 are resolved quickly (under 2 hours).
*   Cases 102, 104, and especially 105 show significantly longer resolution times, indicating performance issues. Case 105 is the clear outlier, taking over two days.

## 2. Determining Potential Root Causes of Delays

To understand the delays, we must analyze the time gaps (Wait Times) between consecutive mandatory steps for the slow cases (102, 104, 105).

### Analysis of Case 102 (25 hours, 10 minutes)

| Activity A | Timestamp A | Activity B | Timestamp B | Duration (Wait + Activity) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Assign to L1 | 09:00 | Escalate to L2 | 11:30 | 2h 30m | Relatively short process time. |
| Escalate to L2 | 11:30 | Investigate Issue | 2024-03-01 14:00 | 2h 30m | Investigation starts relatively quickly after escalation. |
| Investigate Issue | 14:00 | Resolve Ticket | 2024-03-02 09:00 | **19 hours 0 mins** | **Major Delay:** The resolution step does not start until the next morning. This delay spans overnight (approx. 15 hours of inactivity) suggesting the investigation or resolution activity is **not performed continuously or is blocked by business hours/agent availability.** |

### Analysis of Case 104 (24 hours, 10 minutes)

| Activity A | Timestamp A | Activity B | Timestamp B | Duration (Wait + Activity) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Assign to L1 | 09:30 | Investigate Issue | 13:00 | 3h 30m | Moderate investigation setup time. |
| Investigate Issue | 13:00 | Resolve Ticket | 2024-03-02 08:00 | **19 hours 0 mins** | **Major Delay:** Similar to Case 102, the resolution step starts after an overnight gap (approx. 15 hours of inactivity). This suggests the investigation phase itself was completed in the afternoon, but the actual resolution step was paused until the next business day. |

### Analysis of Case 105 (2 days, 1 hour, 5 minutes)

Case 105 includes an escalation, which is often associated with complexity.

| Activity A | Timestamp A | Activity B | Timestamp B | Duration (Wait + Activity) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Assign to L1 | 09:00 | Investigate Issue | 09:10 | 10 mins | Quick start. |
| Investigate Issue | 09:10 | Escalate to L2 | 10:00 | 50 mins | Quick initial investigation followed by escalation. |
| Escalate to L2 | 10:00 | Investigate Issue (L2) | 2024-03-02 14:00 | **28 hours 0 mins** | **Major Delay:** A significant delay (over a day) between the escalation approval and the Level-2 agent *starting* the investigation. This suggests a bottleneck in L2 team capacity or prioritization. |
| Investigate Issue (L2) | 14:00 | Resolve Ticket | 2024-03-03 09:00 | **19 hours 0 mins** | **Major Delay:** Again, the resolution step is paused overnight, similar to Cases 102 and 104. |

## 3. Insights and Recommendations

The analysis reveals two primary recurring factors causing significantly extended resolution times: **Overnight Pauses in Workflows** and **Bottlenecks in Escalation Handling.**

### A. Factor 1: Significant Delays Between Investigation/Resolution Steps (Overnight Pauses)

Cases 102, 104, and 105 all exhibit a large gap (approximately 19 hours) between the start of the final "Investigate Issue" activity (or the previous step) and the start of the "Resolve Ticket" activity, suggesting the system operates under a standard 8-10 hour workday, and work does not resume until the next business day.

**Impact:** This forces a minimum of 1 day of delay on any ticket requiring work that spans past the end of the operational day, regardless of how quickly the investigation was actually completed.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **24/7 Critical Support Tiers:** If these slow cases represent high-priority issues, ensure that Level 1 or Level 2 agents are scheduled to handle investigations and resolutions outside of core business hours.
2.  **Process Review (Investigation Phase):** If the investigation is truly complete, the handover or status update to trigger "Resolve Ticket" should be immediate, rather than waiting for the next day's shift to begin. If the investigation *must* span overnight (e.g., waiting for external monitoring results), clearly log this wait time as "Pending External Data" rather than a generic investigation gap.

### B. Factor 2: Bottleneck in Escalation Handling (Specific to Case 105)

Case 105 experienced a massive 28-hour delay between the ticket being formally escalated and a Level-2 agent beginning their investigation.

**Impact:** Escalated tickets, which are usually complex or high-priority, are being severely stalled, undermining the purpose of having a specialized team.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Level-2 Queue Analysis:** Investigate the Level-2 team's workload and triage process. Why did the ticket sit untouched for 28 hours after escalation? Is there a lack of capacity, or is the L2 queue not prioritized correctly?
2.  **SLA Monitoring for Escalations:** Implement Service Level Agreements (SLAs) specifically for the time between "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" and the next activity, and set up alerts when these internal SLAs are breached.

### Summary of Performance Bottlenecks

The **most common performance killer** appears to be the **non-continuous nature of the workday** affecting resolution steps (Factors A). However, the **most critical potential failure point** is the **handling of specialized issues** (Factor B), where a high-touch ticket was left idling for over a day while waiting for specialized attention.
