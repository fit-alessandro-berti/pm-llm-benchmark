### Merged Event Log

The merged log below integrates events from both systems into a unified format. I standardized the event naming to a consistent, descriptive style (e.g., combining "Order Received" and "OrderReceived" into "Order Received"). For merged events, I included:
- A primary timestamp (chosen as the earlier one from the two logs to reflect the most accurate "start" time, given Log A's potential delay in recording).
- All attributes from both logs, prefixed where necessary (e.g., `user_id_a` if from Log A only, but since Log A lacks user_id/resource_id, they come from Log B).
- An `origin` field to note sources (A, B, or A+B for merged).
- A `notes` field that concatenates any available notes/metadata.

Events are sorted chronologically by the primary timestamp. Unmatched events are included as-is from their source log, with empty fields for missing attributes.

Format: `primary_timestamp, event_type, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes, origin`

```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, Order Received, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system", A+B
2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, Order Validated, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory", A+B
2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay", A+B
2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection", B
2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier", A+B
2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234, , , , A
```

### Reasoning for Merging and Decisions

#### Overall Approach
- **Matching Criteria**: I matched events primarily by `order_id` (all are Order#1234, so this was consistent) and timestamp proximity (using a tolerance of <5 seconds to account for the described offsets, slightly expanding the example of <2 seconds where logical—e.g., for payment events—to avoid unnecessary fragmentation, but only when names semantically aligned). Event names were compared semantically (e.g., "Order Received"  "OrderReceived"; "Payment Processed"  "PaymentCheck" as both relate to payment verification/processing).
- **Timestamp Handling**: Log A is the "primary" timeline, but I used the earlier timestamp as primary for merged events to prioritize potential "start" times (per Log B's richer metadata suggesting more precise capture). Differences were noted but not averaged to avoid introducing artificial precision. For ordering the final log, I used these primary timestamps.
- **Attribute Integration**: Log A's sparse attributes (only event_type and order_id) were supplemented with Log B's richer ones (user_id, resource_id, notes). No conflicts in shared fields (e.g., order_id). For unmatched events, I left fields blank where data was unavailable.
- **Non-Overlapping Events**: 
  - Log B's "Quality Check" at 10:03:00Z had no close match in Log A (nearest is Payment at ~10:02:00Z, but 1-minute gap and unrelated semantics), so it was included separately.
  - Log A's "Item Delivered" at 10:20:00Z had no counterpart in Log B (Log B ends at shipping), so it was included as-is.
- **Conflicts Resolved**: No major conflicts (e.g., no duplicate events with contradictory data). Naming variations were harmonized to Log A's style for consistency (e.g., "Shipping"  "Item Shipped"). All events represent the same order fulfillment process, so no extraneous filtering was needed.

#### Specific Matching Decisions
1. **Order Received / OrderReceived**:
   - Timestamps: A (10:00:00Z) vs. B (09:59:58Z)  2-second difference (borderline on <2s tolerance, but accepted due to exact semantic match and minimal offset likely from system delays).
   - Merged: Used B's earlier timestamp as primary. Attributes from B fully integrated; Log A's event_type used for naming.

2. **Order Validated / OrderValidation**:
   - Timestamps: A (10:01:30Z) vs. B (10:01:29Z)  1-second difference (well within tolerance).
   - Merged: Used B's timestamp. Perfect semantic alignment; notes from B added value.

3. **Payment Processed / PaymentCheck**:
   - Timestamps: A (10:02:00Z) vs. B (10:02:05Z)  5-second difference (exceeds strict <2s but accepted due to close proximity, no other candidates, and semantic similarity—both indicate payment handling; Log B's "delay" note supports potential offset).
   - Merged: Used A's timestamp (primary log) as it was earlier. If not merged, it would fragment the payment step unnecessarily.

4. **Item Shipped / Shipping**:
   - Timestamps: A (10:05:00Z) vs. B (10:05:02Z)  2-second difference (accepted as before).
   - Merged: Used A's earlier timestamp. Strong semantic match; B's notes provide shipping context.

5. **Unmatched: Quality Check (B only)**:
   - No close timestamp or semantic match in A (e.g., post-payment but pre-shipping; could be an interim step not logged in A). Included separately to preserve completeness.

6. **Unmatched: Item Delivered (A only)**:
   - No equivalent in B (Log B focuses on early stages up to shipping). Included as-is; lacks B's attributes, reflecting the logs' differences.

This merged log results in 6 events (5 from A + 5 from B, with 4 merges reducing duplicates). It provides a more complete, enriched view of the process while maintaining traceability via the `origin` field. If stricter tolerance (<2s only) were enforced, the payment events would be separate, but this would under-align given the context of offsets.
