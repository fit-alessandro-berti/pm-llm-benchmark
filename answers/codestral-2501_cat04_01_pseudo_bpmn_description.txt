The pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, differentiating between standard and custom requests, and managing the approval workflow. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:

### Process Overview

1. **Start Event**: The process begins when a customer request is received.
2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**: The initial task captures the customer's request.
3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**: This gateway checks the type of the customer request (Standard or Custom).
4. **Branching Based on Request Type**:
   - **Standard Request Path**:
     - **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**: Validates the standard request.
     - **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**: Initiates parallel checks for credit and inventory.
       - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**: Checks the customer's creditworthiness.
       - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**: Verifies the availability of requested items.
     - **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**: Waits for both checks to complete.
     - **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**: Determines the delivery date based on the checks.
   - **Custom Request Path**:
     - **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**: Analyzes the feasibility of the custom request.
     - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**: Checks if the customization is feasible.
       - **If Yes**: **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**: Prepares a quotation for the custom request.
       - **If No**: **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**: Notifies the customer that the request is rejected and ends the process.

5. **Post-Path Tasks**:
   - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**: Determines if approval is required for the request.
     - **If Yes**:
       - **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**: Seeks approval from a manager.
       - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**:
         - **If Yes**: **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**: Generates the final invoice.
         - **If No**: **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**: Re-evaluates the conditions and loops back to the appropriate task (E1 for Custom Path or D for Standard Path).
     - **If No Approval Needed**: **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**: Generates the final invoice directly.

6. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**: Sends a confirmation to the customer.
7. **End Event**: The process ends.

### Key Points

- **Standard vs. Custom Requests**:
  - **Standard Request**: Follows a straightforward validation and parallel checks path.
  - **Custom Request**: Requires a feasibility analysis and may involve rejection if not feasible.

- **Approval Workflow**:
  - Approval is sought if needed, and the process loops back to re-evaluate conditions if approval is not granted.
  - If no approval is needed, the final invoice is generated directly.

- **Gateways**:
  - **XOR Gateways**: Used to make decisions based on conditions (e.g., request type, feasibility, approval status).
  - **AND Gateway**: Used to synchronize parallel tasks (credit and inventory checks).

- **Looping and Convergence**:
  - The process loops back to re-evaluate conditions if approval is not granted.
  - All paths converge at the point where the final invoice is generated or a rejection notice is sent.

This process ensures that customer requests are handled efficiently, with appropriate validation, checks, and approvals, and that the customer is informed at every stage.
