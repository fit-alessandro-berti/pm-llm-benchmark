Here's how you can create a process tree for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process using the `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj` module. In this example, we'll include activities like 'Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods', 'Invoice Verification', and 'Payment'. We'll also use silent steps (tau) to represent implicit actions.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create root node with parallel operator
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Create leaf nodes for activities and silent steps
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=root)
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=root)
invoice_verification = ProcessTree(label="Invoice Verification", parent=root, operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
payment = ProcessTree(label="Payment", parent=root)

# Create sequence for invoice verification
verify_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Verify Invoice", parent=invoice_verification)
approve_reject = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=invoice_verification)
approve = ProcessTree(label="Approve Invoice", parent=approve_reject)
reject = ProcessTree(label="Reject Invoice", parent=approve_reject)

# Add children to their respective parents
root.children.append(create_po)
root.children.append(receive_goods)
root.children.append(invoice_verification)
root.children.append(payment)

invoice_verification.children.append(verify_invoice)
invoice_verification.children.append(approve_reject)

approve_reject.children.append(approve)
approve_reject.children.append(reject)

# Set parent for silent steps (tau) if needed
# For example, if we want to represent that 'Receive Goods' happens after 'Create Purchase Order'
receive_goods_after_po = ProcessTree(parent=create_po)
receive_goods.parent = receive_goods_after_po

# Print the process tree structure
print(root)
```

This will create a process tree for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process with parallel branches for creating a purchase order and receiving goods, followed by invoice verification (with approval/rejection choice) and payment. You can further customize this structure to fit your specific use case.

To visualize or analyze the created process tree, you can use other functionalities provided by the `pm4py` library.
