Based on the provided DECLARE constraints, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process. Please note that my interpretation might not be exhaustive, and some nuances could be open to alternative understandings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

**Process Name:** Employee Declaration and Payment Handling

**Initialization:**
The process starts with:
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**

**Main Process Flow:**
The following activities are **guaranteed to occur exactly once** (Exactly 1 constraint):
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** (already initiated)
2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
3. **Request Payment**
4. **Payment Handled**

**Sequential Dependencies (inferred from multiple constraints):**

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**  **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** (Precedence, Alternate Precedence, Response, and Succession constraints)
	* The employee's submission must precede the supervisor's final approval.
2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**  **Request Payment** (Chain Precedence, Chain Response, Succession, and Alternate Succession constraints)
	* The supervisor's approval directly triggers the request for payment.
3. **Request Payment**  **Payment Handled** (Chain Response, Chain Succession, and Alternate Succession constraints)
	* The payment request directly leads to the handling of the payment.

**Additional Insights:**

* **No Repetitions:** The "Exactly 1" constraint for each key activity, combined with the absence of any explicit repetition allowances, suggests a straightforward, single-cycle process.
* **Alternating Responses:** The alternate response and alternate succession constraints (e.g., between "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" and the other activities) imply that once an activity occurs, the next one in the sequence must be of a different type, reinforcing the linear, non-repetitive nature of the process.
* **Co-Existence:** While not explicitly defining sequence, this constraint highlights that all four key activities (Submission, Final Approval, Payment Request, and Payment Handling) must occur within the same process instance.
* **Absence Constraints:** The listed absence constraints indicate that various other declaration statuses (e.g., Rejected, Saved, For Approval) are not part of this specific process flow.

**Visualized Process Flow (simplified):**

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
	 (must precede)
2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
	 (directly triggers)
3. **Request Payment**
	 (directly leads to)
4. **Payment Handled**

**All other activities mentioned in the absence constraints are explicitly excluded from this process.**
