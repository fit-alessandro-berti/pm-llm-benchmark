Certainly! The process described in the data involves several steps and approvals for a declaration process, likely within an organizational or financial context. Here's a breakdown of the process flow based on the data provided:

1. **Initial Submission:**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: This is the starting point of the process where an employee submits a declaration.

2. **First Level Approvals:**
   - The declaration can be approved or rejected at various levels:
     - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**: The administration approves the declaration.
     - **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**: The budget owner approves the declaration.
     - **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**: The pre-approver approves the declaration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**: The employee can reject their own declaration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**: The administration can reject the declaration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**: The budget owner can reject the declaration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**: The pre-approver can reject the declaration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**: The supervisor can reject the declaration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**: There is a state labeled "MISSING" which can reject the declaration.

3. **Final Approval:**
   - Once approved by the necessary authorities, the declaration reaches the final approval stage:
     - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: The supervisor gives the final approval.

4. **Payment Request and Handling:**
   - After final approval, the process moves to request payment:
     - **Request Payment**: A payment request is made.
     - **Payment Handled**: The payment is processed.

5. **Rejections and Resubmissions:**
   - If the declaration is rejected at any stage, it can be resubmitted or sent back to the employee for corrections:
     - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** (after being rejected).
     - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** (after being rejected).
     - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION** (after being rejected).
     - **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER** (after being rejected).
     - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER** (after being rejected).
     - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR** (after being rejected).
     - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** (after being rejected).

6. **Special States:**
   - There are some special states in the process:
     - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR**: The declaration is up for approval by the supervisor.
     - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER**: The declaration is up for approval by the pre-approver.
     - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION**: The declaration is up for approval by the administration.
     - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**: The declaration is saved by the employee.

7. **Performance and Frequency:**
   - The data includes performance metrics (likely time taken for each step) and frequency (number of times each transition occurs). This helps in understanding the efficiency and bottlenecks in the process.

### Summary:
The process involves multiple layers of approvals and rejections for a declaration, with the final goal of handling the payment. Each step has associated performance metrics and frequencies, indicating how often each transition occurs and the time taken for each step. The process is designed to ensure thorough review and approval before finalizing and processing the payment.
