### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

The foundation of any process mining initiative is a well-structured event log.

**a. Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

The provided event log snippet demonstrates a good start, but integration requires careful preprocessing:

*   **Case ID Definition:** The `Case ID (Vehicle-Day)` (e.g., `V12-20241205`) is an excellent choice as it encapsulates the end-to-end journey for a single vehicle on a given operational day, making it the primary unit of analysis.
*   **Activity/Event Naming Standardization:**
    *   All "events" or "activities" need a consistent, unique name. For example, GPS `moving` or `idle` could be consolidated into `Travel Segment` or `Dwell Time`, with `Speed` as an attribute. `Low Speed Detected` should be a distinct activity.
    *   Maintenance events (`Maintenance Start`, `Maintenance End`) and Driver events (`Start Shift`, `End Shift`) need to be explicitly integrated, perhaps marked as *non-delivery activities* but crucial for understanding overall vehicle/driver utilization.
    *   Specific scanner events (`Arrive Customer`, `Delivery Success`, `Delivery Failed`, `Depart Customer`) are clear.
    *   Dispatch `Route Assigned` marks the beginning of the planned route for a vehicle.
*   **Timestamp Consistency:** Ensure all timestamps are parsed into a consistent format (e.g., ISO 8601) and are in the same timezone to avoid chronological errors.
*   **Attributes/Context Data:** Retain all relevant attributes for each event: `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID`, `Location`, `Speed`, `Notes`. These attributes are vital for filtering, contextualizing, and enriching analyses.
*   **Geospatial Data Handling:** GPS coordinates (`Location (Lat/Lon)`) are continuous.
    *   **Geofencing:** Define geographical boundaries for key locations like `Depot` and known `Customer` locations. This allows mapping GPS coordinates to semantic locations (e.g., "Arrive at Customer X," "Depart from Depot").
    *   **Activity Inference:** `Arrive Customer` could be inferred not only by scanner data but also by a vehicle stopping within a customer geofence for a duration. `Travel Segment` can be inferred between stops.
    *   **Imputation/Interpolation:** For missing GPS data points (rare but possible), interpolation might be considered, though actual event data should be prioritized.

**Challenges Encountered:**

1.  **Granularity Mismatch:** GPS data is high-frequency (e.g., every 15-30 seconds), while scanner events are discrete. This requires intelligent aggregation or inference to create meaningful activities (e.g., "traveling between stops," "idle at customer site," "prolonged idling").
2.  **Event Correlation & Causality:** Linking a `Low Speed Detected` event (from GPS) to a specific traffic jam or road condition (external context not in log) or correlating an `Unscheduled Stop` with an `Engine Warning Light` (from Notes) and later with a `Maintenance Start` event requires careful attribute joining and possibly sequence analysis.
3.  **Defining "Stops":** Differentiating a legitimate delivery stop from an unscheduled stop (e.g., driver taking a break, traffic congestion) purely from GPS `0 km/h` data is challenging without scanner input. The `Notes` field will be crucial here.
4.  **Data Quality:** Missing timestamps, duplicate entries, or incorrect event types could lead to distorted process models.

**b. Process Discovery Algorithms and Visualization:**

Once integrated, process discovery algorithms can visualize the *actual* flow:

*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Heuristic Miner:** Ideal for this scenario as it handles noise and infrequent paths well, revealing the most common sequences while still showing deviations. It can filter out rare, potentially irrelevant activities/paths.
    *   **Inductive Miner:** Can construct a perfectly structured process model, which is good for understanding the "ideal" flow, but might hide some real-world variability initially.
    *   **Genetic Miner:** Useful for finding high-quality models in noisy data.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   **Process Map (e.g., Petri Net, BPMN-like):** The discovered model would show activities as nodes (e.g., `Depart Depot`, `Arrive Customer`, `Delivery Success`, `Delivery Failed`, `Depart Customer`, `Unscheduled Stop`, `Arrive Depot`) and transitions as directed edges.
    *   **Frequency and Performance Overlays:** The map would be enriched with:
        *   **Frequency:** Highlight the most common paths (e.g., thicker edges, darker nodes for frequent activities). This immediately shows the standard delivery process.
        *   **Performance:** Overlay average durations on activities (e.g., time spent at `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer`) and on transitions (e.g., travel time between `Depart Customer` and next `Arrive Customer`). This reveals where time is spent.
    *   **Variants View:** Show the top 'N' most frequent process variants (sequences of activities). This is crucial for identifying common deviations from the ideal path (e.g., a variant for "successful delivery," "failed delivery with re-attempt," "route with unscheduled maintenance stop").

**c. Conformance Checking against Planned Routes:**

Conformance checking compares the *actual* process discovered from the event log against the *planned* process derived from the dispatch system.

*   **Planned Process Model:** This would be generated from the `Dispatch` system data, outlining the `Planned Routes`, `Assigned Packages`, and `Customer-requested Delivery Time Windows`. For each `Vehicle-Day`, this would define the expected sequence of customer stops.
*   **Types of Deviations to Look For:**
    1.  **Sequence Deviations:**
        *   **Skipped Activities:** Were all planned customer stops actually visited?
        *   **Inserted Activities:** Were there unplanned stops (e.g., `Unscheduled Stop`, additional personal stops not logged)?
        *   **Reordered Activities:** Did the driver visit customers in a different sequence than planned? (e.g., planned sequence A-B-C, actual A-C-B). This could indicate manual optimization by drivers or issues with static planning.
    2.  **Timing Deviations:**
        *   **Actual vs. Planned Travel Time:** Significant differences between the actual time taken to travel between two points (from GPS) versus the dispatch system's estimated travel time.
        *   **On-Time Delivery Compliance:** Checking `Arrive Customer` timestamp against the `Customer-requested Delivery Time Window` for each package.
        *   **Service Time Discrepancies:** Actual time spent at a customer stop (`Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer`) versus any planned/estimated service time.
        *   **Overall Route Duration:** Actual total time (`Depart Depot` to `Arrive Depot`) versus planned route duration.
    3.  **Resource Deviations:** While less likely given explicit `Vehicle ID` and `Driver ID` in the log, one could check if the vehicle/driver assigned in dispatch was indeed the one performing the activities.
    4.  **Attribute Deviations:** Did the `Speed` attribute during travel conform to expected limits or did `Low Speed Detected` events frequently occur on specific planned routes?

By quantifying these deviations (e.g., 20% of routes deviate in sequence, 15% of deliveries are late), Speedy Parcels can identify where the plan breaks down and focus on specific problem areas.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

**a. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

These KPIs are directly calculable from the integrated event log:

1.  **On-Time Delivery Rate:**
    *   *Calculation:* (Number of `Delivery Success` events where `Arrive Customer` timestamp is within `Customer-requested Delivery Time Window` / Total `Delivery Success` events) * 100%.
    *   *Source:* Scanner events, Dispatch system (for time windows).
2.  **First-Time Delivery Rate:**
    *   *Calculation:* (Number of `Delivery Success` events without a preceding `Delivery Failed` for the same `Package ID` / Total `Delivery Attempts`) * 100%.
    *   *Source:* Scanner events, Package ID.
3.  **Average Time per Delivery Stop (Service Time):**
    *   *Calculation:* Average duration between `Arrive Customer` and `Depart Customer` for all `Delivery Success` events.
    *   *Source:* Scanner events.
4.  **Average Travel Time Between Stops:**
    *   *Calculation:* Average duration between `Depart Customer` (or `Depart Depot`) and subsequent `Arrive Customer`. Requires inferring travel segments from GPS data or using scanner events as markers.
    *   *Source:* Scanner events, GPS.
5.  **Vehicle Utilization Rate (Operational Efficiency):**
    *   *Calculation:* (Total `Moving` + `Idle` time during a shift / Total `Shift Duration (End Shift - Start Shift)`). Or `Total Driving Time` / `Total Shift Duration`.
    *   *Source:* GPS, Driver events.
6.  **Rate of Failed Deliveries:**
    *   *Calculation:* (Number of `Delivery Failed` events / Total `Arrive Customer` events for attempted deliveries) * 100%.
    *   *Source:* Scanner events.
7.  **Frequency and Duration of Unscheduled Stops:**
    *   *Calculation:* Count of `Unscheduled Stop` events per route/driver/vehicle, and their average duration.
    *   *Source:* Vehicle GPS, Notes.
8.  **Overtime Percentage:**
    *   *Calculation:* (Time(`End Shift`) - Planned End Time for Shift) / Planned Shift Duration.
    *   *Source:* Driver events, Dispatch System (planned shift duration).

**b. Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**

Process mining offers several techniques to identify bottlenecks:

1.  **Process Map with Performance Overlays:**
    *   **Visualizing Throughput Times:** Overlay average duration on activities and transitions on the discovered process map. Long durations for activities like `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` (high variability in service time) or for `Travel Segment` between specific locations indicate bottlenecks.
    *   **Queuing/Waiting Times:** If a vehicle frequently idles after `Arrive Depot` before `Depart Depot`, or experiences long `Unscheduled Stop`s, these represent waiting time bottlenecks.
2.  **Throughput Time Analysis (Case-level):**
    *   Analyze the overall duration of cases (`Depart Depot` to `Arrive Depot`). Identify cases with excessively long durations.
    *   **Cycle Time/Case Duration Distribution:** Plot histograms or box plots of case durations. Outliers point to problematic routes.
    *   **Filtering:** Filter cases by attributes (e.g., `Route ID`, `Driver ID`, `Day of Week`) to see which groups consistently have longer throughput times.
3.  **Resource Analysis (Driver/Vehicle Performance):**
    *   **Comparative Analysis:** Compare KPIs (e.g., `Average Time per Delivery Stop`, `On-Time Delivery Rate`, `Unscheduled Stop` frequency) across different `Driver ID`s and `Vehicle ID`s. This can highlight drivers who are consistently slower at stops or vehicles that frequently break down.
    *   **Workflow Analysis:** Identify specific drivers who spend more time on non-delivery activities or have higher rates of `Delivery Failed` events.
4.  **Variant Analysis:**
    *   Compare the performance of different process variants. For example, a variant involving a `Delivery Failed` followed by a `Return to Depot` (instead of re-attempting immediately) will have a much higher throughput time and cost. Identifying these high-cost/long-duration variants highlights bottlenecks in recovery processes.
5.  **Time Series and Geographic Analysis:**
    *   **Time of Day/Week:** Plot `Average Travel Time Between Stops` or `On-Time Delivery Rate` by hour of day or day of week to identify periods of peak congestion or inefficiency.
    *   **Geographic Hotspots:** Map `Low Speed Detected` events or `Unscheduled Stop` locations onto a geographical map. Clusters indicate recurring traffic jams or areas with parking difficulties.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   Bottlenecks are quantified by their *frequency* (how often they occur) and *impact* (the duration/cost they add).
        *   For example, "On average, routes passing through `Location X` between 8-9 AM experience a 20% increase in `Travel Time` due to `Low Speed Detected` events, costing an estimated 30 minutes per route."
        *   "Drivers D105 and D110 have an average `Service Time` 25% higher than the fleet average, contributing to 15% of late deliveries."

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Process mining goes beyond *what* is happening to explore *why*.

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning (Static vs. Dynamic):**
    *   **PM Analysis:**
        *   **Conformance Checking:** High number of `Sequence Deviations` from planned routes implies drivers are manually optimizing or finding better routes on the fly, suggesting the planned routes are not optimal.
        *   **Variant Analysis:** Identify common "actual" paths taken by high-performing drivers that differ from the "planned" path.
        *   **Travel Time Analysis:** Compare actual travel times for specific segments against the planned segments. If actuals are consistently faster on alternative paths, it indicates planning deficiencies.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
    *   **PM Analysis:**
        *   **Throughput Time Analysis:** Focus on `Travel Segment` durations. Plot actual travel times against dispatch system estimates for similar distances/segments. Consistent discrepancies or high variance indicate poor estimations.
        *   **Correlation:** Correlate `Low Speed Detected` events and specific `Location` with actual travel times to identify segments where estimates are most inaccurate due to external factors (e.g., road works, recurring bottlenecks).
*   **Impact of Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
    *   **PM Analysis:**
        *   **Event Frequency Analysis:** Count the frequency of `Low Speed Detected` events per `Location (Lat/Lon)` and `Timestamp` (hour of day/day of week).
        *   **Geospatial Clustering:** Visualize clusters of `Low Speed Detected` events on a map to identify specific traffic hotspots.
        *   **Process Map Overlay:** Show the actual paths taken through these hotspots and the associated `Travel Time` impact.
*   **High Variability in Service Time at Customer Locations:**
    *   **PM Analysis:**
        *   **Throughput Time Analysis (Activity Level):** Analyze the duration of `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` activities. Use statistical process control charts to identify outliers and high variability.
        *   **Attribute Correlation:** Correlate service time with `Customer Type` (residential vs. commercial), `Package Size/Weight`, `Time of Day`, or `Notes` (e.g., "difficult access," "signature required").
        *   **Resource Comparison:** Compare average service times across different `Driver ID`s. Are certain drivers consistently faster/slower, or do they struggle more in specific scenarios?
*   **Frequency and Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns or Maintenance Needs During Shifts:**
    *   **PM Analysis:**
        *   **Event Analysis:** Analyze `Unscheduled Stop` events, specifically those with `Notes` indicating `Engine Warning Light` or `Maintenance` related issues.
        *   **Correlation with Maintenance Logs:** Link `Unscheduled Stop` events during shifts with the `Maintenance Logs`. Identify vehicles (by `Vehicle ID`) with a high frequency of in-shift breakdowns, or maintenance events immediately following such stops.
        *   **Downtime Calculation:** Calculate the duration of `Unscheduled Stop` events to quantify their impact on delivery time.
*   **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences:**
    *   **PM Analysis:**
        *   **Resource Analysis:** Compare key KPIs (`On-Time Delivery Rate`, `Average Service Time`, `Rate of Failed Deliveries`, `Overtime Percentage`, `Frequency of Unscheduled Stops`) for each `Driver ID`.
        *   **Variant Analysis (Driver Specific):** Identify common process variants for high-performing versus low-performing drivers (e.g., how top drivers handle failed deliveries, how they manage their stops).
        *   **Deviation Analysis:** Which drivers consistently deviate from planned routes or customer time windows?
*   **Issues Related to Failed Delivery Attempts (Requiring Re-delivery):**
    *   **PM Analysis:**
        *   **Variant Analysis:** Identify variants that include `Delivery Failed` events. Trace the subsequent activities (e.g., `Return to Depot`, `Re-attempt Delivery`).
        *   **Attribute Correlation:** Analyze `Delivery Failed` events by `Package ID`, `Customer Type`, `Time of Day`, and `Notes` (`Customer Not Home`, `Access Issue`).
        *   **Cost Implication:** Calculate the added travel time and driver time associated with re-attempts or returns.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Here are three distinct, concrete, data-driven optimization strategies:

**Strategy 1: Implement Dynamic Route Optimization with Real-time Adjustments**

*   **Specific Inefficiency/Bottleneck Targeted:** Suboptimal route planning, inaccurate travel time estimations, significant impact of traffic congestion patterns, leading to late deliveries and excessive travel time/fuel consumption.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Reliance on static routes that don't adapt to real-world conditions (traffic, unexpected events), and poor estimation of travel times.
*   **How Process Mining Supports Proposal:**
    *   **Conformance Checking:** Reveals frequent `Sequence Deviations` and `Timing Deviations` (actual travel time >> planned) that drivers make to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, indicating limitations of current static planning.
    *   **Geospatial Analysis:** Identifies recurring `Low Speed Detected` hotspots and their `Time of Day` patterns, providing data for predictive traffic modeling.
    *   **Variant Analysis:** Shows that "optimal" routes discovered by drivers often deviate from the planned ones, suggesting opportunities for machine-learning based routing.
    *   **Throughput Time Analysis:** Quantifies the delays caused by traffic/suboptimal routing on specific segments.
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** **Increase** (routes adapt to avoid delays).
    *   **Average Travel Time Between Stops:** **Decrease** (more efficient paths).
    *   **Fuel Consumption:** **Decrease** (less idle time in traffic, shorter/more efficient routes).
    *   **Overtime Percentage:** **Decrease**.

**Strategy 2: Optimize Service Time Management and Enhance Customer Communication**

*   **Specific Inefficiency/Bottleneck Targeted:** High variability in `Average Time per Delivery Stop` (dwell time), and high `Rate of Failed Deliveries`.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Inefficient on-site processes, lack of proactive customer communication leading to customer not being home, and potential driver inefficiencies at customer locations.
*   **How Process Mining Supports Proposal:**
    *   **Throughput Time Analysis (Activity Level):** Reveals high variability and outliers in `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` durations. Filtering by `Driver ID`, `Customer Type`, or `Notes` helps pinpoint specific causes (e.g., long waits for signatures, difficult access points).
    *   **Variant Analysis:** Identifies variants with `Delivery Failed` events and analyzes their `Notes` (`Customer Not Home`, `Access Issue`, `Wrong Address`).
    *   **Resource Analysis:** Pinpoints drivers who consistently have longer service times, indicating potential training needs or sharing of best practices.
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** **Decrease** (more efficient on-site operations).
    *   **First-Time Delivery Rate:** **Increase** (fewer failed attempts).
    *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** **Decrease**.
    *   **Overall Route Duration:** **Decrease** (less time wasted at stops or on re-deliveries).

**Strategy 3: Implement Predictive and Proactive Vehicle Maintenance Scheduling**

*   **Specific Inefficiency/Bottleneck Targeted:** `Unscheduled Stop` events due to vehicle issues, leading to unexpected downtime, late deliveries, and higher reactive maintenance costs.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance schedules and unexpected vehicle breakdowns during operational shifts.
*   **How Process Mining Supports Proposal:**
    *   **Event Analysis:** Identifies the frequency and duration of `Unscheduled Stop` events, specifically those related to vehicle issues.
    *   **Correlation with Maintenance Logs:** Links specific `Vehicle ID`s to recurring breakdown patterns or maintenance events that occur immediately after an `Unscheduled Stop` (e.g., `Engine Warning Light` events consistently precede certain types of unscheduled maintenance).
    *   **Vehicle Usage Patterns:** Analyzes vehicle utilization (`Total Driving Time`, `Distance Traveled`) from GPS data against maintenance schedules to identify if some vehicles are overused without adequate proactive maintenance.
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** **Increase** (fewer unexpected delays).
    *   **Frequency of Unscheduled Stops (Vehicle Issues):** **Decrease**.
    *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** **Increase** (less downtime).
    *   **Maintenance Costs:** **Decrease** (shifting from reactive to more cost-effective preventive maintenance).

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

**a. Accounting for Operational Constraints:**

Any optimization strategy must operate within the practical boundaries of the business:

*   **Driver Working Hours:**
    *   Process mining can identify routes or strategies that consistently lead to driver `Overtime logged`.
    *   Optimized routes must be modeled to fit within legal driving limits and company shift durations. The proposed dynamic routing should integrate real-time remaining driving time.
    *   The `End Shift` event and its timestamp are critical for monitoring adherence to this.
*   **Vehicle Capacities:**
    *   The dispatch system already tracks `Vehicle Capacity`. While process mining doesn't directly optimize capacity, it can show if routes are leading to `Delivery Failed` due to "Not enough space for return" (if logged) or if vehicles are consistently returning with packages that could not be delivered, indicating a mismatch between planned volume and actual capacity utilization. Optimized routes must respect these constraints from the dispatch system.
*   **Customer Time Windows:**
    *   This is a primary constraint. Conformance checking directly assesses `On-Time Delivery Rate`.
    *   Dynamic routing must prioritize meeting critical time windows, even if it means a slight deviation from the shortest path or most fuel-efficient route.
    *   Optimizing service time management aims to create more buffer to meet these windows.
*   **Road Network Restrictions:** The route optimization models would need to incorporate vehicle-specific restrictions (e.g., height/weight limits) and road closures, typically provided by external mapping services, which can be validated against GPS data showing unexpected detours.

**b. Continuous Monitoring Using Process Mining Dashboards:**

Implementation of changes requires continuous monitoring to ensure effectiveness and identify new issues.

*   **Monitoring Plan:**
    *   **Dashboard Creation:** Develop interactive process mining dashboards (e.g., using Celonis, Disco, ProM, or custom BI tools with process mining capabilities).
    *   **Regular Review:** Conduct daily/weekly reviews of key metrics and process models, with monthly deep-dives.
    *   **Automated Alerts:** Set up automated alerts for critical deviations (e.g., On-Time Delivery Rate drops below X%, number of `Unscheduled Stop` events spike, specific drivers consistently exceed overtime).
*   **Key Metrics and Process Views to Track:**

    1.  **Overall Delivery Performance (High-Level KPIs):**
        *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Trend over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
        *   **First-Time Delivery Rate:** To ensure fewer re-deliveries.
        *   **Average Route Duration:** Actual vs. planned.
        *   **Total Distance Traveled per Route/Package:** Monitor fuel efficiency.
        *   **Overtime Percentage:** To track driver working conditions and costs.

    2.  **Process Conformance & Deviations:**
        *   **Conformance Score:** Percentage of cases (routes) that fully conform to the planned process.
        *   **Deviation Count/Type:** Track the frequency of `Sequence Deviations`, `Inserted Activities` (e.g., `Unscheduled Stop`), and `Timing Deviations`.
        *   **Frequency of `Delivery Failed` Events:** Break down by reason (`Customer Not Home`, `Access Issue`).

    3.  **Bottleneck Monitoring:**
        *   **Average Travel Time Between Stops:** Monitor specific segments or areas identified as bottlenecks.
        *   **Average Service Time per Stop:** Track variability and identify outliers.
        *   **Frequency/Duration of `Low Speed Detected` Events:** Especially in identified traffic hotspots.
        *   **Unscheduled Stop Analysis:** Frequency by `Vehicle ID` and `Driver ID` to monitor maintenance impact and driver behavior.

    4.  **Resource Performance:**
        *   **Driver Scorecards:** KPIs for each `Driver ID` (On-Time Rate, Service Time, Failed Delivery Rate, Overtime).
        *   **Vehicle Health Metrics:** `Unscheduled Stop` frequency, `Maintenance Start` events within shifts for each `Vehicle ID`.

*   **Ensuring Effectiveness and Sustainability:**
    *   **A/B Testing:** For new strategies (e.g., new routing algorithm), A/B test with a control group of vehicles/drivers to directly measure impact.
    *   **Feedback Loops:** Integrate feedback from drivers and dispatchers. Their qualitative insights can help interpret quantitative data from the dashboards.
    *   **Iterative Optimization:** Process mining is not a one-time fix. The continuous monitoring process allows for iterative refinement of strategies based on new data and evolving operational conditions (e.g., seasonal traffic, new urban developments).

By implementing this comprehensive process mining approach, Speedy Parcels can transition from reactive problem-solving to proactive, data-driven operational excellence, ultimately improving delivery punctuality and significantly reducing costs.
