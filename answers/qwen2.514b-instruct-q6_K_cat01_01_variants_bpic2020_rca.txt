To analyze the root causes of performance issues within this process based on the provided variants and their frequencies and performances, we need to closely examine where the significant delays or inefficiencies occur. Here's a step-by-step analysis focusing on specific areas:

### High Frequency Variants with Poor Performance:
1. **Variant: Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
   - **Frequency:** 345
   - **Performance:** 1,604,595.638

2. **Variant: Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
   - **Frequency:** 188
   - **Performance:** 2,061,236.516

In both cases, the root cause appears to be the multiple rejections and resubmissions (REJECTED -> REJECTED -> SUBMITTED) before final approval, leading to significant delays.

### Variants with Rejected States:
- The performance is particularly poor in variants where there are multiple rejection states followed by retries. Each rejection requires the employee to correct their declaration and submit it again, resulting in a loss of time for both the employee and administrators involved.
  
### Variant Analysis Based on Performance:
1. **Long Variants with Multiple Rejections:**
   - These scenarios show a significant drop in performance compared to smoother paths without rejections. Each rejection involves additional steps (communication between parties, correction by the employee, etc.), which are time-consuming.

2. **Handling of Rejections by Different Parties:**
   - The presence of multiple rejectors (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER) can complicate the process flow and introduce delays.
   
### Considerations for Each Step:
- **Employee Actions:** The submission step seems straightforward unless there are issues with initial data quality or completeness that require rework after rejection by any authority.
- **Administrative Rejections (ADMINISTRATION):** High performance costs indicate that ADMINISTRATION's rejections might be due to missing information, errors in the submission, or compliance issues. Each rejection necessitates an employee correction cycle and another review cycle.
  
### Key Findings:
1. **Multiple Rejections:** The variants with multiple rejections by different parties (ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER) exhibit significantly lower performance than those without.
2. **Rework Cycles:** Each rejection followed by resubmission introduces additional delays.
3. **Data Quality and Compliance Issues:** These seem to be significant contributors to the need for rework cycles.

### Recommendations:
1. Enhance Initial Training: Ensure employees understand all requirements before submitting a declaration to minimize initial errors.
2. Improve Communication: Streamline communication between the EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, and SUPERVISOR to reduce ambiguity in rejection reasons and necessary corrections.
3. Automate Validation Processes: Implement automated checks at submission time to catch common mistakes early on, reducing the likelihood of rejections.

By addressing these specific issues within the process flow, performance can be improved by reducing unnecessary cycles of submission and correction.
