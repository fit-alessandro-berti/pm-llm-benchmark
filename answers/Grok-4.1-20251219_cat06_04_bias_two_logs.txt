The event logs reveal a clear **bias** favoring **Group B** (the unprotected group) over **Group A** (the protected group). This bias manifests through differential treatment based on the `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` attributes, specifically via the application of a **score adjustment** ("Community Boost") that is available only to Group B members.

### Key Differences in Process
- **Group A (Protected)**: All applicants have `LocalResident = FALSE` and `CommunityGroup = None`. No score adjustments are applied (`ScoreAdjustment = 0` throughout). The final score equals the preliminary score, and decisions appear based directly on that unadjusted score.
- **Group B (Unprotected)**: All applicants have `LocalResident = TRUE`. When `CommunityGroup` is "Highland Civic Darts Club", a +10 "Community Boost" is applied during PreliminaryScoring, resulting in an adjusted final score (e.g., 720 → 730, 695 → 705). When `CommunityGroup = None`, no adjustment is applied (similar to Group A).

### How Bias Manifests in Final Decisions
The adjustment creates systematic advantages for certain Group B applicants, leading to disparate impact on approval outcomes even when underlying preliminary scores indicate similar or lower risk/qualification:

- **Direct Comparison of Similar Cases**:
  | Preliminary Score | Group A Outcome (No Adjustment) | Group B Outcome (With/Without Adjustment) |
  |-------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
  | 720               | Approved (P001: final 720)     | Approved (U001: final 730 after +10 boost) |
  | 710               | Rejected (P002: final 710)     | Rejected (U002: final 710, no boost since no community group) |
  | ~700 range        | No equivalent case             | Approved (U003: 695 → 705 after +10 boost) |

- The +10 boost allows a Group B applicant with a lower preliminary score (695 in U003) to reach an effective score (705) that likely crosses the approval threshold, resulting in approval. An equivalent applicant in Group A would receive no such boost and likely be rejected if their preliminary score fell in a similar marginal range.
- Even for identical preliminary scores (e.g., 720), Group B can receive an extra buffer via the boost, making their approval more secure against any potential downward variations.

### Root Causes of Systematic Differences
- The boost is tied to membership in a specific community group ("Highland Civic Darts Club"), which appears exclusively in Group B logs alongside `LocalResident = TRUE`. Group A members lack access to this attribute combination, so they never qualify for the adjustment.
- This creates **disparate treatment**: The process explicitly applies a favorable rule (+10 points for community involvement) only to the unprotected group.
- It also risks **disparate impact**: Even if the policy seems neutral on its face (rewarding "community involvement"), if membership in recognized groups correlates with group membership (here, perfectly with unprotected status), it disproportionately benefits Group B, leading to higher approval rates for comparable or weaker applications.

Overall approval rates in this small sample are coincidentally equal (2/3 approved in each group), but the boost mechanism enables approvals in Group B that would not occur in Group A under equivalent preliminary conditions. Scaled up, this would systematically disadvantage the protected group, constituting bias in the process. The log for **Group B** exhibits this bias through the selective application of positive score adjustments unavailable to Group A.
