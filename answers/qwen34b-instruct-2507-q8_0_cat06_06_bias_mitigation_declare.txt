### **Rationale for Added Bias-Mitigating Constraints**

These new constraints are designed to enforce fairness and reduce discriminatory outcomes in a loan application review process by introducing **explicit checks** and **prohibiting direct, biased transitions** based on sensitive attributes.

1. **Coexistence of `ManualReview` with sensitive attribute checks**  
   - *Constraint:* `CheckApplicantRace` and `CheckApplicantGender` must coexist with `ManualReview`.  
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that when sensitive demographic information is collected (e.g., race or gender), a human review is always triggered. This prevents automated decisions from being made without oversight, reducing the risk of bias against underrepresented groups.

2. **Coexistence with `BiasMitigationCheck`**  
   - *Constraint:* Sensitive attribute checks (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`) must coexist with `BiasMitigationCheck`.  
   - **Rationale:** This adds a layer of proactive bias detection. Even if a manual review occurs, a formal bias assessment step ensures that the decision-making process is audited for potential discriminatory patterns.

3. **Succession Constraint: Prevent direct transition from sensitive checks to "Reject"**  
   - *Constraint:* `nonsuccession["CheckApplicantRace"]  {"Reject"}` and similarly for gender.  
   - **Rationale:** This explicitly blocks a biased path where a sensitive attribute check (e.g., race) is immediately followed by a "Reject" decision. Such a direct path would indicate automated discrimination. The constraint forces at least one mitigating step (like `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`) to occur in between.

4. **Succession to `BiasMitigationCheck`**  
   - *Constraint:* After detecting race or gender, the process must first go through `BiasMitigationCheck`.  
   - **Rationale:** This ensures that any sensitive information is not directly used to make a final decision. Instead, it triggers a review process to evaluate whether a decision based on that information is fair and justified.

5. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`**  
   - *Constraint:* These activities are explicitly required to exist.  
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that the process includes mandatory fairness safeguards, making it impossible to bypass bias mitigation.

### **Overall Impact on Bias Reduction**

By enforcing **coexistence** of fairness checks with sensitive data collection and **prohibiting direct succession** from sensitive events to biased decisions (like `Reject`), the model ensures that:
- Sensitive attributes do not lead directly to decisions.
- Human oversight is always involved when such data is observed.
- The process is transparent and auditable, reducing the risk of algorithmic or systemic bias.

This transforms the loan review process from one that may silently discriminate into one that is **proactively fair, transparent, and accountable**. The constraints create a structural barrier against bias while preserving the necessary flow of the process.
