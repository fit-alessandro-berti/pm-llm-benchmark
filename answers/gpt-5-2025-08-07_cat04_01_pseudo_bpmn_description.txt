Here’s a clear walkthrough of the process, what each step does, how the gateways route work, and how the standard vs. custom paths behave, including when approvals and rework are triggered.

High-level intent
- Goal: Take an incoming customer request, determine whether it’s standard or custom, validate feasibility and risk, derive a delivery commitment and/or quote, obtain approvals if required, then issue an invoice/confirmation. If the request is not feasible (custom) or cannot meet conditions, communicate a rejection.

Step-by-step with purpose and routing
1) Start Event
- Trigger: A new customer request arrives (from web form, email, CRM, etc.).

2) Task A: Receive Customer Request
- Purpose: Capture the request details, customer identity, requested items/specs, quantities, dates, and any customization needs. Create a case/order record.

3) Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type
- Meaning: Data-based exclusive gateway. Exactly one path is taken based on classification rules.
- Criteria example: If the request matches predefined SKUs/options, it’s Standard; if it requires new specs/engineering/config beyond catalog, it’s Custom.

Standard path
4) Task B1: Perform Standard Validation
- Purpose: Check completeness, match to catalog, basic pricing rules, standard terms eligibility, and policy checks (e.g., minimum order quantities).

5) Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks
- Meaning: Parallel split. Both branches start at the same time to reduce cycle time.
   - Task C1: Credit Check
     - Purpose: Assess customer credit status/limit, payment terms eligibility, risk flags.
     - Output: Credit status (OK/warning/hold), allowable exposure.
   - Task C2: Inventory Check
     - Purpose: Verify stock availability or production capacity and lead times.
     - Output: Available-to-promise quantities/dates or backorder timelines.

6) All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)
- Meaning: AND-join. The flow waits until both Credit Check and Inventory Check have finished before proceeding.

7) Task D: Calculate Delivery Date
- Purpose: Compute a realistic delivery/ship date based on inventory/capacity, lead times, logistics, and any constraints found during checks. May also adjust quantities or propose staggered deliveries.

Custom path
4’) Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis
- Purpose: Technical and operational review by engineering/operations to determine if the custom need can be met, at what cost, with what lead time and risk. Often includes solution design, BOM estimation, supplier engagement, and cost/margin analysis.

5’) Gateway (XOR): Is Customization Feasible?
- Meaning: Exclusive decision based on feasibility outcome.
   - If Yes: proceed to Task E1.
   - If No: proceed to Task E2 and end.

6’) Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation
- Purpose: Construct a proposal with scope, specifications, price, lead time, terms, and assumptions. This becomes the basis for approval and invoicing.

7’) Task E2: Send Rejection Notice
- Purpose: Communicate inability to fulfill the custom request, optionally suggest alternatives.
- Flow ends here for infeasible custom requests.

Converging standard/custom paths
8) After the standard (Task D) or the custom (Task E1) work is complete, both paths feed into:
- Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Needed?
- Meaning: An exclusive decision that also acts as a merge of the alternative paths. Only one token arrives (standard or custom), then the decision is made on approval needs.

Approval branch
9) Task F: Obtain Manager Approval (if needed)
- Purpose: Route the case for managerial/commercial approval.

10) Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Granted?
- Meaning: Exclusive decision.
   - If Yes: proceed to invoice (Task G).
   - If No: go to rework (Task H).

11) Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions (if approval denied)
- Purpose: Adjust the offer/plan to satisfy policy or margin/risk constraints.
- Loop-back behavior:
   - For Custom requests: Loop to Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation) to revise scope, price, or lead time.
   - For Standard requests: Loop to Task D (Calculate Delivery Date) to adjust delivery commitments, quantities, or terms.
- Practical notes: Limit iterations, capture reasons for denial, and allow escalation if repeated rejections occur.

No-approval branch
9’) If no approval is needed, skip directly to invoicing.

Closure
12) Task G: Generate Final Invoice
- Purpose: Create the invoice (often a proforma at order acceptance), finalize pricing/terms, and record the order in ERP/finance systems.

13) Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer
- Purpose: Send the invoice/order confirmation, delivery details, and next steps to the customer; update CRM and notify internal teams.

14) End Event
- The process completes after confirmation is sent. For rejected custom requests, it ends right after the rejection notice.

How the gateways work
- XOR gateways (exclusive):
  - Check Request Type: Only one of Standard vs. Custom proceeds.
  - Is Customization Feasible?: Only Yes or No can proceed.
  - Is Approval Needed?: Either to Approval or directly to Invoice.
  - Is Approval Granted?: Either to Invoice or to Rework.
- AND gateways (parallel):
  - Run Parallel Checks: Starts Credit and Inventory checks at the same time.
  - Join after Parallel Checks: Waits for both to finish before continuing.

Key differences: Standard vs. Custom
- Standard:
  - Focus on catalog validation, risk (credit), and availability (inventory).
  - Delivery date calculation is central (Task D).
  - Approval may be required for exceptions (rush dates, low margin, high exposure) but often skipped if within policy.
- Custom:
  - Feasibility is the gating step; if not feasible, process ends with a rejection.
  - If feasible, a custom quotation (Task E1) is prepared; this often triggers approval due to higher risk/cost/complexity.
  - Rework, if approval is denied, means revising the custom quotation rather than delivery dates.

When is approval needed?
- Typical policy triggers (examples; define precisely in your organization):
  - Discount exceeds threshold or margin below policy.
  - Total order value above approval limit.
  - Credit risk is high or customer is near/exceeding credit limit.
  - Non-standard terms (payment, warranty, penalties) or expedited delivery that increases cost.
  - Custom engineering content beyond predefined scope.
- The “Is Approval Needed?” gateway evaluates these rules based on data from prior steps (credit status, inventory feasibility, costs/margins, and quote terms).

When is rework triggered?
- Rework occurs when “Is Approval Granted?” = No.
- Standard path: Adjust delivery plan, quantities, shipping methods, or terms to meet policy (loop to Task D).
- Custom path: Adjust scope/spec, costs, lead time, or terms in the quotation to meet approval criteria (loop to Task E1).
- Best practice: Limit the number of rework loops, track reasons, and allow escalation or customer negotiation if constraints cannot be satisfied.

How paths converge or end
- Convergence:
  - Standard and Custom feasible paths both converge at “Is Approval Needed?” (an XOR merge/decision).
  - Parallel checks converge using an AND-join before delivery date calculation.
- Termination:
  - Custom not feasible: Send Rejection Notice  End Event.
  - All other accepted flows: Generate Final Invoice  Send Confirmation  End Event.

Assumptions and clarifications to consider
- Negative outcomes in standard checks: If credit or inventory checks fail outright, you may need explicit alternate flows (e.g., credit hold or backorder negotiation). Currently, the model implies these are resolved within Task D or via approval rules; consider adding explicit exception branches if required.
- Approval timeouts/escalation: Consider timers and escalations on Task F.
- Data traceability: Ensure you capture decisions, thresholds, and rework rationale for auditability.

This explanation matches the pseudo-BPMN’s intent: clear routing by request type, parallel risk/availability checks for standard requests, feasibility gating for custom, conditional managerial approval, and controlled rework cycles leading to a final invoice and customer confirmation.
