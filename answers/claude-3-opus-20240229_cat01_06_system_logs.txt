**Explanation:**

The events were grouped into cases based on the window titles, which seem to represent distinct documents or tasks the user was working on. For example, all events related to "Document1.docx" were considered part of the "Document1" case.

The activity names were standardized to represent higher-level actions rather than the raw low-level events. For instance:
- "FOCUS" and "TYPING" events on the same document were combined into "Edit Document" activities. 
- "CLICK" events related to emails were translated to "Read Email", "Reply to Email", etc.
- "SCROLL" and "HIGHLIGHT" events on the PDF were interpreted as "Review PDF" and "Highlight PDF" activities.

The logic aims to tell a coherent story of the user's work session, showing how they edited various documents, handled an email, reviewed a PDF report, updated a budget spreadsheet, and worked on a quarterly report. The derived activity names provide a more meaningful process-level view compared to the original low-level system events.
