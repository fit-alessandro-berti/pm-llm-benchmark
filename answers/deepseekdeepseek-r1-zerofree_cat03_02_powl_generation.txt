To construct the POWL model for the described complex digital service provisioning process at a telecom company for setting up a new corporate network, we need to identify the steps and their orderings:

1. The process starts with a "Service Request Verification" (SR) transition, which must be completed first.
2. After SR, the "Contract Setup" (CS) must be done.
3. After CS, the "Datacenter Allocation" (DA) and "Access Control Initialization" (ACI) tasks can be done concurrently until both are completed.
4. Once both DA and ACI are completed, a looped configuration phase follows where:
    - First, "Base Network Configuration" (BNC) is executed.
    - If any issues are detected, a "Debug & Reconfigure" (D&R) step is performed.
    - The loop ends when the network configuration is stable (i.e., BNC followed by an optional D&R until stable).
5. After the network is successfully configured (exit from the loop), there is an exclusive choice between:
    - "Containerized Deployment" (CD) or
    - "Monolithic Deployment" (MD).
6. Once one of these deployments is completed, the next tasks are:
    - "Quality Assurance" (QA) tests.
    - "Security Audit" (SA).
    
    Both QA and SA can be done in any order or concurrently but must both be completed.
7. Once both QA and SA are completed, the final "Go-Live Approval" (GLA) occurs.

Based on this, a POWL model can be structured as follows:

#### 1. Define the individual activities (transitions):
- `SR` for "Service Request Verification"
- `CS` for "Contract Setup"
- `DA` for "Datacenter Allocation"
- `ACI` for "Access Control Initialization"
- `BNC` for "Base Network Configuration"
- `D&R` for "Debug & Reconfigure"
- `CD` for "Containerized Deployment"
- `MD` for "Monolithic Deployment"
- `QA` for "Quality Assurance"
- `SA` for "Security Audit"
- `GLA` for "Go-Live Approval"

#### 2. Define the partial order for the main flow:
1. `SR` must be followed by `CS`.
2. `CS` must be followed by `DA` and `ACI` (which can be done concurrently).
3. Once `DA` and `ACI` are both completed, a loop starts where `BNC` is followed by an optional `D&R` until the configuration is stable.
4. After the loop, there is an exclusive choice between `CD` and `MD`.
5. After `CD` or `MD`, `QA` and `SA` tasks should be done concurrently until both are completed.
6. After `QA` and `SA` are both completed, `GLA` is done.

#### 3. Construct the POWL model:
Let us define the individual activity transitions first:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

SR = Transition(label="SR")
CS = Transition(label="CS")
DA = Transition(label="DA")
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")
D_R = Transition(label="D&R")
CD = Transition(label="CD")
MD = Transition(label="MD")
QA = Transition(label="QA")
SA = Transition(label="SA")
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")
```

#### 4. Organize the "DA" and "ACI" tasks such that they can be done concurrently once `CS` is completed:
This part requires a partial order where `CS` should be followed by `DA` and `ACI`, which should be executed concurrently until both are done. Thus, a partial order should be created where `CS` is the source node and `DA` and `ACI` are target nodes. Another part of the process requires that once `DA` and `ACI` are both completed, the next part of the process should be the loop `* ( BNC, D&R )`:

```python
# After CS, DA and ACI should be done concurrently until both are completed.
po1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# The BNC and D&R should be in a loop: BNC followed by optional D&R until stable.
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# After DA and ACI are both completed, the loop should be executed.
po2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI, loop])
po2.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
po2.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)

# The part between CS and the loop should be a part of a larger partial order that starts from CS.
root1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[CS, po2])
root1.order.add_edge(CS, po2)
```

#### 5. After the loop is exited, there should be an exclusive choice between `CD` and `MD`:
```python
# An exclusive choice between CD and MD.
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# The exclusive choice should be executed once the loop is completed.
root2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
root2.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
```

#### 6. Once `CD` or `MD` is completed, `QA` and `SA` should be done concurrently until both are done:
```python
# QA and SA should be done concurrently once CD or MD is completed.
po3 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# The XOR should be followed by the partial order of QA and SA.
root3 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[xor, po3])
root3.order.add_edge(xor, po3)
```

#### 7. After both `QA` and `SA` are completed, `GLA` should be done:
```python
# After QA and SA, GLA should be executed.
root4 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[po3, GLA])
root4.order.add_edge(po3, GLA)
```

#### 8. The overall structure should be:
1. `SR` followed by `CS`.
2. `CS` followed by `DA` and `ACI` in parallel until both are done.
3. `DA` and `ACI` should be followed by a loop `* ( BNC, D&R )`.
4. The loop should be followed by a choice `X ( CD, MD )`.
5. `CD` or `MD` should be followed by concurrent `QA` and `SA`.
6. `QA` and `SA` should be followed by `GLA`.

To construct the full model, it makes sense to make one main `StrictPartialOrder` for the entire process where `SR` is the first step and `GLA` is the last step. However, there are a few parts here where you need to make sure that the orderings are correctly defined. Another way to make it a bit more structured is to make a top-level `StrictPartialOrder` where:
1. `SR` is the first node.
2. `SR` should be followed by `CS`.
3. `CS` should be followed by a "Process Block" which includes everything until `GLA`.

The "Process Block" itself should be defined as follows:
1. `CS` should be followed by `DA` and `ACI` which should be done concurrently until both are done.
2. After `DA` and `ACI`, a loop should be executed until the network is stable (BNC followed by an optional `D&R`).
3. After the loop, an exclusive choice should be made between `CD` and `MD`.
4. After the exclusive choice, `QA` and `SA` should be done concurrently until both are done.
5. After `QA` and `SA`, `GLA` should be executed.

To make a more organized top-level partial order, we need to make a "main" partial order where `SR` is executed first, followed by `CS`, and everything else should be a part of a sub-partial order until `GLA`.

This results in a main partial order where `SR` should be followed by `CS`, followed by a sub-partial order until `GLA`:
```python
# First part: CS should be followed by a partial order where DA and ACI are concurrent until both are done.
po1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# Second part: The loop is executed after both DA and ACI are done.
po2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[po1, loop])
po2.order.add_edge(po1, loop)

# Third part: Once loop is done, the XOR should be executed.
po3 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
po3.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

# Fourth part: Once the XOR is done, QA and SA should be done concurrently.
po4 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[xor, QA, SA])
po4.order.add_edge(xor, QA)
po4.order.add_edge(xor, SA)

# Fifth part: Once QA and SA are both done, GLA should be executed.
po5 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA, GLA])
po5.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
po5.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)
```

However, the reasoning should make a single "main" partial order that makes sure all the orderings are respected. Another way to make a more clear top-level structure might be:
```python
# Top-level order could be:
# SR -> CS -> (DA, ACI) -> loop -> xor -> (QA, SA) -> GLA

# We need a partial order that joins DA and ACI as concurrent until both are done.
# Thus, make a partial order for DA and ACI first.
DA_ACI_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# After DA and ACI are done, the loop should start.
# Thus, make another partial order where DA_ACI_order is followed by the loop.
DA_ACI_loop_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA_ACI_order, loop])
DA_ACI_loop_order.order.add_edge(DA_ACI_order, loop)

# After the loop, the xor should be executed.
loop_xor_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
loop_xor_order.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

# After xor, QA and SA should be done concurrently until both are done.
QA_SA_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# Thus, make a partial order where xor is followed by QA_SA_order.
xor_QA_SA_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[xor, QA_SA_order])
xor_QA_SA_order.order.add_edge(xor, QA_SA_order)

# After QA and SA, GLA should be executed.
QA_SA_GLA_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA_SA_order, GLA])
QA_SA_GLA_order.order.add_edge(QA_SA_order, GLA)

# Now, we need to make sure that the main flow is respected:
# SR -> CS -> (DA, ACI) -> loop -> xor -> (QA, SA) -> GLA
main_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, xor, QA, SA, GLA])
main_order.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
main_order.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
main_order.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
main_order.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
main_order.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)
main_order.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
main_order.order.add_edge(xor, QA)
main_order.order.add_edge(xor, SA)
main_order.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
main_order.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)
```

However, `main_order` seems a bit too flat. A more structured way might be:
```python
# SR should be followed by CS.
# CS should be followed by a part that handles DA and ACI concurrently, followed by a loop.
# Once the loop is done, xor should be executed.
# Once xor is done, QA and SA should be done concurrently until both are done.
# Once QA and SA are done, GLA should be executed.

po1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
po2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[po1, loop])
po2.order.add_edge(po1, loop)
po3 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
po3.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
po4 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[xor, QA, SA])
po4.order.add_edge(xor, QA)
po4.order.add_edge(xor, SA)
po5 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA, GLA])
po5.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
po5.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Now, the top-level partial order should look something like:
# SR -> CS -> po2 -> po3 -> po4 -> po5
top_level_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, po1, po2, po3, po4, po5])
top_level_order.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(CS, po1)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(po1, po2)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(po2, po3)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(po3, po4)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(po4, po5)
```

However, what we need might be a single top-level partial order where all the steps are connected in one sequence. Another, more "flattened" way to make sure that the orderings are respected could be:

1. `SR` should be followed by `CS`.
2. `CS` should be followed by `DA` and `ACI` (which can be done concurrently until both are done).
3. `DA` and `ACI` should be followed by the BNC loop (BNC followed by D&R until stable).
4. The loop should be followed by an exclusive choice between `CD` and `MD`.
5. `CD` or `MD` should be followed by `QA` and `SA` which should be done concurrently.
6. `QA` and `SA` should be followed by `GLA`.

However, the "flattened" way might make the model a bit harder to read. Another approach could be a more "sequential" way where each part is a strict partial order:

1. `SR` should be followed by `CS`.
2. `CS` should be followed by `DA`, `ACI` (parallel), and then the `loop`.
3. `loop` should be followed by the `xor` choice.
4. `xor` should be followed by `QA` and `SA` (parallel), which should be followed by `GLA`.

Based on this, a more "linear" sequence might be:
```python
# Step-by-step partial order (1)
# SR should be followed by CS.
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# Step-by-step partial order (2)
# CS should be followed by DA and ACI (concurrently).
po1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[CS, DA, ACI])
po1.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
po1.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# Step-by-step partial order (3)
# DA and ACI should be followed by the loop.
po2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI, loop])
po2.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
po2.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)

# Step-by-step partial order (4)
# The loop should be followed by the xor choice between CD and MD.
po3 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
po3.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

# Step-by-step partial order (5)
# The xor should be followed by QA and SA (concurrently).
po4 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[xor, QA, SA])
po4.order.add_edge(xor, QA)
po4.order.add_edge(xor, SA)

# Step-by-step partial order (6)
# QA and SA should be followed by GLA.
po5 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA, GLA])
po5.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
po5.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Combine them into a top-level partial order:
# SR -> CS -> (DA, ACI) -> loop -> xor -> (QA, SA) -> GLA
main_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, xor, QA, SA, GLA])
main_order.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
main_order.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
main_order.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
main_order.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
main_order.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)
main_order.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
main_order.order.add_edge(xor, QA)
main_order.order.add_edge(xor, SA)
main_order.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
main_order.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)
```

However, this might not be the most "structured" way to handle complex dependencies. Another way to make a more "hierarchical" structure might be:
1. `SR` should be followed by `CS`.
2. `CS` should be followed by a partial order where `DA` and `ACI` are done concurrently until both are done.
3. `DA` and `ACI` should be followed by a loop of `BNC` and `D&R`.
4. The loop should be followed by a choice between `CD` and `MD`.
5. Whatever choice is made should be followed by a partial order where `QA` and `SA` are done concurrently until both are done.
6. `QA` and `SA` should be followed by `GLA`.

Considering this, let us try a more hierarchical structure:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

SR = Transition(label="SR")
CS = Transition(label="CS")
DA = Transition(label="DA")
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")
D_R = Transition(label="D&R")
CD = Transition(label="CD")
MD = Transition(label="MD")
QA = Transition(label="QA")
SA = Transition(label="SA")
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")

# Parallel execution of DA and ACI after CS
DA_ACI_parallel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# After DA and ACI, execute the loop (BNC followed by optional D&R)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# After the loop, make a choice between CD and MD
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# After CD or MD, execute QA and SA in parallel
QA_SA_parallel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# Main workflow order
# SR should be followed by CS.
# CS should be followed by DA and ACI (which should be done in parallel).
# DA and ACI should be followed by the loop.
# The loop should be followed by the XOR choice.
# The XOR choice should be followed by QA and SA (which should be done in parallel).
# QA and SA should be followed by GLA.

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA_ACI_parallel, loop, xor, QA_SA_parallel, GLA])
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA_ACI_parallel)
root.order.add_edge(DA_ACI_parallel, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, QA_SA_parallel)
root.order.add_edge(QA_SA_parallel, GLA)
```

This appears to make a more organized and "hierarchical" POWL model. However, it seems that the `StrictPartialOrder` used here might need to be a single one where all nodes are managed in a "single" graph.

However, the description might need a more "flattened" top-level partial order. Let us simplify the top-level partial order as follows:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
SR = Transition(label="SR")
CS = Transition(label="CS")
DA = Transition(label="DA")
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")
D_R = Transition(label="D&R")
CD = Transition(label="CD")
MD = Transition(label="MD")
QA = Transition(label="QA")
SA = Transition(label="SA")
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")

# After CS, DA and ACI are done in parallel
DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
DA_ACI_after_CS = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[CS, DA_ACI])
DA_ACI_after_CS.order.add_edge(CS, DA_ACI)

# After DA and ACI, execute the loop (BNC followed by optional D&R)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])
loop_after_DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA_ACI, loop])
loop_after_DA_ACI.order.add_edge(DA_ACI, loop)

# After the loop, make a choice between CD and MD
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])
xor_after_loop = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
xor_after_loop.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

# After CD or MD, execute QA and SA in parallel
QA_SA = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
QA_SA_after_xor = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[xor, QA_SA])
QA_SA_after_xor.order.add_edge(xor, QA_SA)

# After QA and SA, execute GLA
GLA_after_QA_SA = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA_SA, GLA])
GLA_after_QA_SA.order.add_edge(QA_SA, GLA)

# Main workflow order
# SR should be followed by CS.
# CS should be followed by DA and ACI (which should be done in parallel).
    # DA and ACI should be followed by the loop.
    # The loop should be followed by the XOR choice.
    # The XOR choice should be followed by QA and SA (which should be done in parallel).
    # QA and SA should be followed by GLA.
    
# So, a high-level partial order should be:
# SR -> (CS -> (DA_ACI -> loop -> xor -> QA_SA -> GLA))
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, DA_ACI_after_CS, loop_after_DA_ACI, xor_after_loop, QA_SA_after_xor, GLA_after_QA_SA])
root.order.add_edge(SR, DA_ACI_after_CS)
root.order.add_edge(DA_ACI_after_CS, loop_after_DA_ACI)
root.order.add_edge(loop_after_DA_ACI, xor_after_loop)
root.order.add_edge(xor_after_loop, QA_SA_after_xor)
root.order.add_edge(QA_SA_after_xor, GLA_after_QA_SA)
```

This might need a bit of a verification of its correctness, however, the main structure seems to make sense based on the requirements.

Another way to make it even more structured and readable is to make sure that the process is as follows:
1. `SR` is followed by `CS`.
2. `CS` is followed by `DA` and `ACI` concurrently.
3. `DA` and `ACI` are followed by the loop `* ( BNC, D&R )`.
4. After the loop, `X ( CD, MD )`.
5. After `CD` or `MD`, `QA` and `SA` are done concurrently.
6. `QA` and `SA` are followed by `GLA`.

Here is another try for a more "streamlined" version:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define transitions for each activity.
SR = Transition(label="SR")
CS = Transition(label="CS")
DA = Transition(label="DA")
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")
D_R = Transition(label="D&R")
CD = Transition(label="CD")
MD = Transition(label="MD")
QA = Transition(label="QA")
SA = Transition(label="SA")
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Step 2: After CS, DA and ACI should be done in parallel until both are completed.
DA_ACI_parallel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# Step 3: After DA and ACI are both completed, the loop should start (BNC followed by optional D&R).
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Step 4: After the loop completes, there is an exclusive choice between CD and MD.
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 5: After CD or MD, QA and SA should be done in parallel.
QA_SA_parallel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# Step 6: Overall process flow.
process_flow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA_ACI_parallel, loop, xor, QA_SA_parallel, GLA])
process_flow.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
process_flow.order.add_edge(CS, DA_ACI_parallel)
process_flow.order.add_edge(DA_ACI_parallel, loop)
process_flow.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
process_flow.order.add_edge(xor, QA_SA_parallel)
process_flow.order.add_edge(QA_SA_parallel, GLA)

# The final POWL model is stored in the variable "process_flow".
```

This seems like a well-structured and logically ordered POWL model that follows the given scenario description. The code should accurately reflect the process described.

#### Verification
To verify that the POWL model is correctly constructed, it’s usually helpful to visualize it. The `pm4py` library has a function to visualize POWL models:
```python
from pm4py.visualization.powl import visualizer as powl_visualizer

# Visualize the POWL model.
gviz = powl_visualizer.apply(process_flow, parameters={powl_visualizer.Variants.POWL.value.Parameters.FORMAT: "svg"})
powl_visualizer.view(gviz)
```

However, based on the question, the main part is to make sure that the constructed POWL model matches the required process steps and their orderings.
