Explanation of the added anti-bias constraints
1. Existence(BiasMitigationCheck)  
   Guarantees that every loan-application case contains at least one explicit step that checks the process for disparate treatment.

2. Responded-Existence(CheckApplicantRace_Minority / …  ManualReview)  
   Ensures that whenever an applicant belongs to a protected group (minority race, female gender, senior age), a human **ManualReview** always appears somewhere in the same trace. This inserts an additional layer of scrutiny where bias is most likely.

3. Coexistence(BiasMitigationCheck, FinalDecision)  
   Makes the bias check and the final decision mutually obligatory: if one is present, the other must be as well, so that no case “slips through” with just one of them.

4. Response(CheckApplicantRace / CheckApplicantGender / CheckApplicantAge  BiasMitigationCheck)  
   Forces the process to perform a bias-mitigation step after any disclosure of a sensitive attribute before moving forward, blocking the path to a decision until fairness is assessed.

5. Precedence(BiasMitigationCheck, FinalDecision)  
   Prohibits giving a final decision unless a bias-mitigation check has already occurred—an explicit “gatekeeper” against premature judgment.

6. Succession(ManualReview  FinalDecision)  
   Guarantees that additional manual scrutiny is not an end in itself; it must be resolved into the same standardized decision activity as every other case, promoting consistency.

7. Non-Succession(CheckApplicantRace / Gender / Age  FinalDecision)  
   Directly blocks the “sensitive attribute  immediate decision” pattern that often signals discriminatory shortcuts. At least one intervening activity (typically BiasMitigationCheck or ManualReview) is now required.

Together these declarative rules break the simplest paths that could encode or mask unfair treatment, while obligating explicit, auditable fairness checks before any approval or rejection is finalized.
