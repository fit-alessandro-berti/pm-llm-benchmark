### **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

#### **Using Event Log Data and Process Mining Techniques**
- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:** Use process mining to identify the number of cold-packing stations used at any given time and correlate this with the waiting times for orders requiring cold-packing. Resource availability and allocation can be analyzed using resource-centric process mining techniques.
  
- **Shipping Batches:** Analyze the time differences between when orders are ready for shipping and when the shipping label is generated. Batching can be detected by identifying groups of orders with the same destination region that are completed at similar times but shipped together.

- **Priority Handling:** Compare the processing times of express and standard orders, especially focusing on resources that are preempted or reprioritized due to express orders. Use conformance checking to identify deviations from expected resource allocation.

- **Hazardous Material Limits:** Monitor the number of hazardous material orders in packing and quality check activities simultaneously. Use time-series analysis to identify periods where the limit of 10 is approached or exceeded.

#### **Metrics to Measure Impact**
- **Waiting Time Due to Resource Contention:** Measure the duration from when an order is ready for packing to when it actually starts packing.
  
- **Waiting Time for Batch Completion:** Calculate the time delay from the completion of packing to the generation of the shipping label for orders in batches.

- **Delays Caused by Express Orders:** Measure the additional waiting time incurred by standard orders when express orders preempt resources.

- **Throughput Reduction Due to Hazardous Limits:** Track the number of orders in packing/quality check and identify delays caused by the regulatory limit.

#### **Differentiating Waiting Times**
- **Within-Instance Factors:** Measure the duration of individual activities for each order.
  
- **Between-Instance Factors:** Identify overlapping activities across multiple orders that compete for shared resources or batch completion, and measure the waiting times due to these dependencies.

### **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**

#### **Interactions Between Constraints**
- **Priority Handling and Shared Cold-Packing:** Express orders requiring cold-packing will increase the queue for the limited cold-packing stations, causing longer waiting times for standard orders.

- **Batching and Hazardous Material Limits:** If multiple hazardous orders are destined for the same region, they may be batched together, increasing the risk of exceeding the regulatory limit during packing and quality check.

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation and Regulatory Compliance:** Increasing the number of cold-packing stations might alleviate the waiting times but could also inadvertently affect the handling of hazardous materials.

#### **Understanding Interactions for Optimization**
- **Holistic View:** Understanding these interactions allows for a more holistic approach to optimization, ensuring that changes in one area do not negatively impact others.
  
- **Conflict Resolution:** Addressing one constraint might exacerbate another; hence, strategies must be developed in tandem to balance the overall system performance.

### **3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations**
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations
- **Changes Proposed:** Implement an intelligent scheduling system that dynamically allocates cold-packing stations based on the real-time demand from express and standard orders.
- **Data Leverage:** Use predictive analytics to forecast demand for cold-packing stations and allocate resources accordingly.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced waiting times for both express and standard orders, improved utilization of cold-packing stations.

#### **Strategy 2: Optimized Batching Logic**
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shipping Batches
- **Changes Proposed:** Develop a more flexible batching algorithm that forms batches based on real-time order completion rather than fixed time intervals.
- **Data Leverage:** Use historical data to determine the optimal batch sizes and trigger batch formation based on real-time order flow.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Faster batch formation, reduction in waiting times for orders ready but awaiting shipping label generation.

#### **Strategy 3: Enhanced Scheduling Rules for Hazardous Materials**
- **Constraint Addressed:** Hazardous Material Limits
- **Changes Proposed:** Implement a scheduling system that monitors the number of hazardous material orders in packing and quality check, and prioritizes them to avoid exceeding regulatory limits.
- **Data Leverage:** Use real-time monitoring and alerts to ensure compliance, and adjust the scheduling of hazardous orders based on current load.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Maintain regulatory compliance while minimizing delays for hazardous material orders.

### **4. Simulation and Validation**

#### **Simulation Techniques**
- **Resource Contention Modeling:** Simulate the resource allocation for cold-packing stations and measure the impact on waiting times and throughput.
  
- **Batching Delay Simulation:** Model different batching strategies to evaluate their impact on shipping label generation times.
  
- **Priority Handling Impact:** Simulate scenarios where express orders preempt resources to assess the impact on standard orders.
  
- **Regulatory Limit Compliance:** Simulate the scheduling of hazardous material orders to ensure the regulatory limit is not exceeded.

#### **Focus Areas in Simulation Models**
- **Accurate Representation of Resources:** Ensure the simulation accurately reflects the number and type of resources available.
  
- **Realistic Order Flow:** Use historical data to generate realistic order arrival and processing times.
  
- **Constraint Interactions:** Model the interactions between constraints to evaluate their combined impact on the process.

### **5. Monitoring Post-Implementation**

#### **Key Metrics and Dashboards**
- **Queue Lengths for Shared Resources:** Track how long orders wait for cold-packing stations.
  
- **Batch Formation Times:** Monitor the time taken to form and complete batches for shipping.
  
- **Express Order Impact:** Measure the delays caused to standard orders by express orders.
  
- **Hazardous Material Compliance:** Continuously monitor the number of hazardous orders in packing and quality check activities.

#### **Tracking Instance-Spanning Constraints**
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Set up alerts for when queue lengths exceed thresholds or hazardous material limits are approached.
  
- **Performance Dashboards:** Create dashboards that display key metrics in real-time, providing visibility into how constraints are being managed.
  
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use ongoing process mining to identify new bottlenecks and refine optimization strategies based on real-time data.
