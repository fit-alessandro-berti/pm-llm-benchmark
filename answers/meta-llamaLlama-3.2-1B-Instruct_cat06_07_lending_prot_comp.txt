After analyzing the provided process variants, I've identified several unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second). Here are the main differences:

1. **Additional Follow-up Steps**: The 'protected' group (first) receives an additional follow-up step (`Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied`) compared to the 'unprotected' group (second). This step can help identify potential issues that led to the loan denial.
2. **Response Time**: The 'unprotected' group (second) has a significantly shorter response time (2-4 minutes) compared to the 'protected' group (first), which takes around 15-20 minutes to process the loan application.
3. **Due Diligence**: The 'protected' group (first) undergoes more due diligence checks, including verifying borrowers' information, and submitting files to underwriters. In contrast, the 'unprotected' group (second) typically relies on automated processes and does not require these checks.
4. **Loan Denial Process**: The 'unprotected' group (second) has a more streamlined loan denial process, with fewer steps and a shorter response time. The 'protected' group (first), on the other hand, has a more complex process with multiple steps and a longer response time.
5. **Number of Requests**: The 'protected' group (first) sends more requests, including a request for a co-signer, a visit to assess collateral, and a sign-on loan agreement. This may indicate that the 'protected' group (first) is taking more time to evaluate the borrower's creditworthiness or requires additional steps to be taken.
6. **Variability in Response Times**: The 'unprotected' group (second) shows a wider range of response times, with some applications being approved quickly and others taking significantly longer. In contrast, the 'protected' group (first) has more consistent response times.

These differences highlight the potential need for more due diligence and checks in the 'unprotected' group (second) to prevent loan denials and ensure that the process is efficient and effective.
