Here's a **DuckDB SQL** query that fulfills all the requirements of the prompt. It:

1. Extracts the ordered sequence of activities per `case_id`.
2. Groups cases by their full activity sequence to identify process variants.
3. Counts the number of cases per variant and finds the top K variants.
4. Filters the original event log to include only events from cases in the top K variants.

---

###  Assumptions:
- `K` is a parameter you can set (e.g., `K = 3`).
- The `timestamp` column is of type `TIMESTAMP` or can be cast to it.
- The table is named `event_log`.

---

###  DuckDB SQL Query:

```sql
WITH
-- Step 1: Extract the ordered activity sequence per case
ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS step
    FROM event_log
),

-- Step 2: Build the full sequence as a string for each case
activity_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY step) AS variant
    FROM ordered_activities
    GROUP BY case_id
),

-- Step 3: Count how many cases per variant and rank them
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS variant_rank
    FROM activity_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),

-- Step 4: Get the top K variants
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE variant_rank <= 3  -- Change 3 to your desired K
),

-- Step 5: Get all case_ids that belong to the top K variants
top_case_ids AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM activity_sequences
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
)

-- Step 6: Return all events from the original log for those top K cases
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_case_ids)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

---

###  Notes:

- `STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY step)` builds a string like `"A -> B -> C"` for each case's activity sequence.
- `RANK()` is used to find the top K variants by frequency.
- `K` can be adjusted by changing `variant_rank <= 3` to another number.
- This query is **fully contained** and works directly in DuckDB without external dependencies.

---

###  Example Output:

If the top 3 variants are:
- `"A -> B -> C"` (100 cases)
- `"A -> D"` (75 cases)
- `"B -> A -> C"` (50 cases)

Then the final result will include **all events** from the `case_id`s that follow one of these three sequences.

Let me know if you want a version with parameterized `K` or to return the top K variants as a separate result set.
