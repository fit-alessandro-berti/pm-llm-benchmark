Certainly! Here is an example of how the declarative model might be structured:
```lua
DECLARE Fine Model(
    Create Fine Operation,
    Send Fine Operation,
    Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture Operation,
    Add penalty Operation,
    Payment Operation,
    Insert Fine Notification Operation,
    Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture Operation,
    Send Appeal to Prefecture Operation,
    Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture Operation,
    Notify Result Appeal to Offender Operation,
    Appeal to Judge Operation
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Fine (
    fine_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    fine_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    fine_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    fine_recipient VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    fine_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    fine_status VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS FineNotification (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    fine_id INT NOT NULL,
    notification_type VARCHAR(20),
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    send_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY(fine_id) REFERENCES Fine(fine_id)
);
```

In the model, there are five operations (`Create Fine`, `Send Fine`, `Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture`, `Add penalty`, and `Payment`) that can be performed on a fine record. There are also several data structures to store information about the fines:
- A table called `Fine` where fine details are stored, including the amount of the fine, the type, recipient, and date
- An array of `FineNotification` objects to hold information about the notification that is sent to the prefecture

This model can be used as a declarative model for a system that manages fines, allowing developers to write code that represents the process flow with ease.
