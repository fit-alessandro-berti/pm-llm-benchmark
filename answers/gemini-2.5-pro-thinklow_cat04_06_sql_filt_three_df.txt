### Method Explanation

This problem requires a multi-step approach to first identify cases that meet a complex set of criteria and then exclude them from the final result set. The most efficient way to achieve this in DuckDB (and standard SQL) is by using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions.

1.  **Sequencing with `LEAD()`**: The core challenge is to check for a *direct sequence* of activities. The `LEAD()` window function is perfect for this. By partitioning the data by `case_id` and ordering it by `timestamp`, we can "look ahead" at the next one or two events for any given row.
    -   We create a CTE named `sequenced_events` where for each event, we also retrieve the next activity (`next_activity`), its timestamp (`next_timestamp`), the activity after that (`next_next_activity`), and its timestamp (`next_next_timestamp`).

2.  **Identifying Cases to Exclude**: A second CTE, `cases_to_exclude`, is built upon `sequenced_events`. This CTE's purpose is to create a definitive list of `case_id`s that must be filtered out. It applies the two specific conditions from the prompt:
    -   **Sequence Condition**: It filters for rows where the `activity` is `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, `next_activity` is `'Create Order'`, and `next_next_activity` is `'Confirm Order'`. This finds the start of our target sequence.
    -   **Timing Condition**: It then applies the second filter, ensuring that the time difference between the `next_next_timestamp` (Confirm Order) and `next_timestamp` (Create Order) is greater than 5 days. DuckDB's `INTERVAL` syntax makes this check straightforward.
    -   We use `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` to get a unique list, as a case might theoretically contain the pattern more than once.

3.  **Final Exclusion**: The final `SELECT` statement is now simple. It retrieves all columns (`*`) from the original `event_log` table but uses a `WHERE` clause with a `NOT IN` subquery. This subquery fetches the list of `case_id`s from our `cases_to_exclude` CTE, effectively removing all events belonging to those flagged cases from the final output.

This chained CTE approach is highly readable and logically separates the steps, making the query easy to understand and maintain.

### DuckDB SQL Query

```sql
-- This query identifies cases with a specific 3-activity sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order')
-- where the time between the 2nd and 3rd activity is > 5 days, and then excludes all events from those cases.

-- CTE 1: Use the LEAD window function to see the next two events for each event within a case.
WITH sequenced_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        -- Look ahead one step for the 'Create Order' event
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        -- Look ahead two steps for the 'Confirm Order' event
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM
        event_log
),

-- CTE 2: Identify the unique case_ids that meet both the sequence and timing criteria for exclusion.
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM
        sequenced_events
    WHERE
        -- Condition 1: The direct sequence of three activities
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        
        -- Condition 2: The time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events
        AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

-- Final Step: Select all events from the original log, excluding those from the identified cases.
SELECT
    *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY
    case_id, timestamp;
```

### Example Usage

Here is a complete, runnable example including table creation and sample data to demonstrate the query's functionality.

#### 1. Setup and Data Insertion

```sql
-- Create the event_log table
CREATE TABLE event_log (
    case_id VARCHAR,
    activity VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO event_log (case_id, activity, timestamp) VALUES
-- Case 1: A standard case, should be INCLUDED
('case_01', 'Start', '2023-01-10 09:00:00'),
('case_01', 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2023-01-10 10:00:00'),
('case_01', 'End', '2023-01-10 11:00:00'),

-- Case 2: Has the sequence, but time difference is exactly 3 days (< 5 days). Should be INCLUDED.
('case_02', 'Start', '2023-02-01 08:00:00'),
('case_02', 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2023-02-01 09:00:00'),
('case_02', 'Create Order', '2023-02-02 10:00:00'),
('case_02', 'Confirm Order', '2023-02-05 11:00:00'),
('case_02', 'End', '2023-02-06 12:00:00'),

-- Case 3: Has the sequence AND time difference is 6 days (> 5 days). Should be EXCLUDED.
('case_03', 'Start', '2023-03-05 14:00:00'),
('case_03', 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2023-03-06 15:00:00'),
('case_03', 'Create Order', '2023-03-07 16:00:00'),
('case_03', 'Confirm Order', '2023-03-13 17:00:00'),
('case_03', 'End', '2023-03-14 18:00:00'),

-- Case 4: Has the activities, but NOT in direct succession. Should be INCLUDED.
('case_04', 'Start', '2023-04-10 09:00:00'),
('case_04', 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2023-04-10 10:00:00'),
('case_04', 'Create Order', '2023-04-11 11:00:00'),
('case_04', 'Amend Order', '2023-04-12 12:00:00'), -- This breaks the direct sequence
('case_04', 'Confirm Order', '2023-04-20 13:00:00'),
('case_04', 'End', '2023-04-21 14:00:00'),

-- Case 5: Another case with the sequence AND time difference > 5 days. Should be EXCLUDED.
('case_05', 'Start', '2023-05-01 10:00:00'),
('case_05', 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2023-05-02 11:00:00'),
('case_05', 'Create Order', '2023-05-03 12:00:00'),
('case_05', 'Confirm Order', '2023-05-15 13:00:00'), -- 12 day difference
('case_05', 'End', '2023-05-16 14:00:00');
```

#### 2. Expected Output

Running the main query on the sample data above will return all events from `case_01`, `case_02`, and `case_04`, because they do not meet the exclusion criteria. Events from `case_03` and `case_05` will be entirely filtered out.
