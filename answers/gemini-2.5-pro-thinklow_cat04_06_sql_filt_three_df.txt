Of course. Here is a complete and robust DuckDB SQL query that fulfills the requirements of the prompt.

### **Methodology Explanation**

The query is structured using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clarity and modularity.

1.  **`sequenced_events` CTE:**
    *   This is the core of the sequence detection logic.
    *   It uses the `LEAD()` window function to look ahead within each `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`.
    *   For every event, it fetches the activity and timestamp of the next two events (`next_activity`, `next_next_activity`, `next_timestamp`, `next_next_timestamp`). This allows us to "see" a potential sequence of three from a single row.

2.  **`cases_to_exclude` CTE:**
    *   This CTE queries the `sequenced_events` table to find the specific cases that must be filtered out.
    *   It applies the two conditions from the prompt:
        1.  **Sequence Match:** It checks if the current `activity` is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the `next_activity` is 'Create Order', and the `next_next_activity` is 'Confirm Order'. This identifies the exact, directly-following sequence.
        2.  **Time Condition:** It then calculates the duration between the 'Confirm Order' event (`next_next_timestamp`) and the 'Create Order' event (`next_timestamp`). It filters for instances where this duration is greater than 5 days using `INTERVAL '5' DAY`.
    *   The result of this CTE is a distinct list of `case_id`s that meet both criteria for exclusion.

3.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   The final query selects all columns (`*`) from the original `event_log` table.
    *   It uses a `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` clause to filter out all events belonging to the cases identified in the `cases_to_exclude` CTE.
    *   An `ORDER BY` clause is added to present the final results in a structured way, which is good practice.

### **DuckDB SQL Query**

```sql
-- This query identifies cases with a specific 3-step sequence and a time condition,
-- and then excludes all events from those cases from the final result.

-- CTE to create a view of events with their next two successors in the same case.
WITH sequenced_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        -- Look ahead to the next activity and its timestamp
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        -- Look ahead to the activity after the next one and its timestamp
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM
        event_log
),

-- CTE to identify the specific case_ids that should be excluded.
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM
        sequenced_events
    WHERE
        -- Condition 1: Find the exact sequence of three activities.
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        
        -- Condition 2: Check if the time between the 2nd and 3rd event in the sequence is > 5 days.
        AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
)

-- Final SELECT statement: Return all events from the log,
-- EXCLUDING those from the cases identified above.
SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp
