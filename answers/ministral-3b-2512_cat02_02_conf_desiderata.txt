### **1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Rules)**

#### **Case 1:**
 **No violations** – Follows the exact sequence and decision logic:
- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- No skipped steps, order is preserved, and documentation is finalized only after approval.

#### **Case 2:**
 **Violates normative rules (Credit Check before Risk Assessment):**
- **Problem:** Risk Assessment occurs **before** Credit Check (at **08:20** vs. **08:00**).
- **Why it’s wrong:** The normative constraint explicitly states:
  > *"Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."*
- **Impact:** This breaks the required sequence, making the process invalid.

#### **Case 3:**
 **No violations** – Follows the exact sequence and decision logic:
- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- The only deviation is timing (desiderata), which does not affect the normative structure.

### **2. Failures to Meet Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

#### **Case 1:**
 **No desiderata violations** – Meets timing recommendations:
- Credit Check completed within **24 hours** (09:30 vs. 09:00).
- Applicant informed within **48 hours** (13:00 vs. 11:00).
- No follow-up call (but this is not a strict requirement).

#### **Case 2:**
 **No desiderata violations** – While the normative rule was broken, the timing is irrelevant here since the process was invalid.

#### **Case 3:**
 **Violates desiderata (timing and follow-up):**
- **Credit Check delayed beyond 24 hours** (09:00  10:00, **41 hours later**).
  - While not a strict rule, this is a **desideratum** (preferred but not required).
- **Applicant informed much later than recommended** (15:00 vs. **48 hours after decision**).
  - Again, not a strict rule, but suboptimal.
- **No follow-up call** (desideratum for alignment).
  - While not a strict requirement, this is a missed best practice.

### **3. Possible Interpretations or Justifications (If Applicable)**

#### **Case 2 (Normative Violation – Risk Assessment Before Credit Check):**
- **Possible Justification:**
  - If the system was misconfigured (e.g., a bug where Risk Assessment was triggered before Credit Check), it could be a **system error** rather than intentional misuse.
  - However, since the event log shows **Credit Check happening later (09:00)**, it suggests the Risk Assessment was done prematurely, violating the rule.
  - **Conclusion:** Likely an **intentional or accidental error** in process execution.

#### **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations – Timing & Follow-Up):**
- **Possible Justifications:**
  - **Credit Check delay (41 hours):** Could be due to:
    - High workload (e.g., backlog in credit analysis).
    - External dependencies (e.g., third-party data delays).
  - **Late notification (16 days after approval):** Could be due to:
    - Manual delays in communication.
    - Applicant’s request for more time.
  - **No follow-up call:** Could be due to:
    - Applicant’s request for no contact.
    - System not triggering follow-up automatically.

- **Conclusion:** These are **not strict violations**, but they indicate **process inefficiencies** that could be improved.

### **Summary Table**

| **Case** | **Normative Violations?** | **Desiderata Violations?** | **Justification for Deviations** |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **1**    |  No                    |  No                     | Follows all rules strictly.       |
| **2**    |  Yes (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) |  No | Possible system error or misconfiguration. |
| **3**    |  No                    |  Yes (timing & follow-up) | Process inefficiencies (delayed checks, late notifications, no follow-up). |

### **Final Observations:**
- **Strict rules (normative) must be enforced**—Case 2 is a clear failure.
- **Desiderata are flexible but should be followed**—Case 3 shows suboptimal timing and communication.
- **Possible explanations exist**, but the **core issue in Case 2 is a process error**, while Case 3 reflects **operational inefficiencies**.
