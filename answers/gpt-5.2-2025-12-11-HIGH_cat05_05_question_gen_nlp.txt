1. How do you balance cost, resilience, and performance when selecting and managing this geographically dispersed supplier base (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, U.S.)?

2. What criteria determine when to dual-source or multi-source critical components (e.g., processors, screens), and how do you quantify the risk reduction versus added complexity?

3. How do you incorporate supplier lead-time variability, yield rates, and quality drift into demand planning and production scheduling without creating excess buffer inventory?

4. What early-warning signals (operational, financial, geopolitical, climate-related) would trigger proactive supplier or logistics reconfiguration, and how are those signals monitored?

5. How do contractual terms (incoterms, penalties, minimum order quantities, price adjustment clauses) shape day-to-day planning decisions and long-term flexibility?

6. What is the most significant bottleneck in the end-to-end flow today (component constraints, assembly capacity, test throughput, freight capacity, customs delays), and how do you validate that with data?

7. How do you decide which steps in assembly and testing should be automated versus manual, and how do you measure the impact on quality, cost, and throughput over time?

8. How are quality issues traced back across suppliers and manufacturing steps (e.g., lot/batch traceability), and what gaps exist in root-cause analysis speed or accuracy?

9. When a quality problem emerges (e.g., camera module defect), how do you decide between containment, rework, redesign, supplier change, or recall—and what governance ensures timely decisions?

10. How do you design the “air vs. sea” transportation decision rules, and how do you evaluate trade-offs between cost, speed, emissions, and market service levels?

11. What assumptions underpin the just-in-time replenishment approach in high-demand markets, and how do you stress-test those assumptions for disruptions (port strikes, pandemics, export controls)?

12. How do you segment markets and channels (retail, e-commerce, direct-to-consumer VIP/pre-orders) to tailor inventory policies, service levels, and fulfillment strategies?

13. What mechanisms ensure customs, insurance, and regulatory compliance is consistent across regions, and where are the most common points of delay or error?

14. How do multi-currency exposures (supplier payments, freight, duties, sales revenue) influence procurement and pricing decisions, and what hedging strategies are used?

15. How do you measure the true landed cost per unit by region (including duties, returns, warranty, expedited freight, and obsolescence), and how is that used in decision-making?

16. How do forecasting models and machine learning outputs get integrated into planner workflows, and how do you detect/mitigate model bias or overfitting during demand shocks?

17. What data governance practices ensure end-to-end visibility (purchase orders, shipment status, WIP, inventory, sales) across time zones and systems, and what data gaps most limit insight?

18. How do you manage product lifecycle transitions (new model ramp-up, old model phase-out) to minimize obsolete inventory while maintaining availability during peak demand?

19. How do environmental and labor compliance requirements influence supplier selection, audits, and corrective actions, and how do you verify compliance beyond self-reporting?

20. What continuous improvement initiatives have delivered the largest reductions in lead time, cost, or carbon footprint so far, and what prevents scaling those improvements across the entire network?
