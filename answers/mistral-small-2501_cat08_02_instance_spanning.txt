### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

**Identification and Quantification:**

To identify and quantify the impact of instance-spanning constraints, we can use process mining techniques such as:

1. **Process Discovery:** Construct a process model from the event log to visualize the sequence of activities and identify bottlenecks.
2. **Conformance Checking:** Compare the actual process execution with the ideal process model to identify deviations caused by constraints.
3. **Performance Analysis:** Analyze the event log to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) such as waiting times, throughput, and resource utilization.

**Metrics for Impact Measurement:**

1. **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:**
   - **Metric:** Average waiting time for cold-packing stations.
   - **Calculation:** Measure the time difference between the completion of item picking and the start of packing for orders requiring cold-packing.

2. **Shipping Batches:**
   - **Metric:** Average waiting time for batch completion.
   - **Calculation:** Measure the time difference between the completion of packing and the start of shipping label generation for orders in a batch.

3. **Priority Handling:**
   - **Metric:** Average delay caused to standard orders by express orders.
   - **Calculation:** Compare the expected completion time of standard orders without interruptions to the actual completion time.

4. **Hazardous Material Limits:**
   - **Metric:** Throughput reduction due to hazardous material limits.
   - **Calculation:** Measure the number of hazardous material orders processed per unit time and compare it to the total number of orders processed.

**Differentiating Waiting Times:**

- **Within-Instance Factors:** Long activity durations can be identified by analyzing the time taken for each activity within an order's lifecycle.
- **Between-Instance Factors:** Waiting times due to shared resources can be identified by analyzing the time between the completion of one activity and the start of the next, especially when the next activity requires a shared resource.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

**Potential Interactions:**

1. **Cold-Packing and Priority Handling:**
   - An express order requiring cold-packing may preempt a standard order, leading to increased waiting times for standard orders at cold-packing stations.

2. **Batching and Hazardous Material Limits:**
   - If multiple hazardous material orders are destined for the same region, batching may cause delays due to the regulatory limit on simultaneous processing.

**Importance of Understanding Interactions:**

Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective optimization strategies. For example, if express orders frequently preempt standard orders at cold-packing stations, it may be necessary to allocate dedicated cold-packing stations for express orders to minimize delays for standard orders.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations**

- **Constraint Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations.
- **Proposed Changes:** Implement a dynamic resource allocation policy where cold-packing stations are prioritized based on order type and urgency.
- **Data/Analysis:** Use historical data to predict demand for cold-packing stations and allocate resources dynamically.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced waiting times for cold-packing, improved throughput for express orders, and minimized disruptions for standard orders.

**Strategy 2: Revised Batching Logic**

- **Constraint Addressed:** Shipping Batches.
- **Proposed Changes:** Implement dynamic batch formation triggers based on real-time data, such as order volume and destination region.
- **Data/Analysis:** Use machine learning algorithms to optimize batch sizes and formation times based on historical data.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Faster batch formation, reduced waiting times for shipping label generation, and improved delivery times.

**Strategy 3: Improved Scheduling Rules**

- **Constraint Addressed:** Priority Handling and Hazardous Material Limits.
- **Proposed Changes:** Develop scheduling rules that consider order priorities and regulatory limits. For example, schedule hazardous material orders in smaller batches to comply with limits while ensuring timely processing.
- **Data/Analysis:** Use simulation models to test different scheduling rules and their impact on throughput and compliance.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Improved compliance with regulatory limits, reduced delays for standard orders, and better management of express order priorities.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

**Simulation Techniques:**

1. **Discrete Event Simulation (DES):** Use DES to model the fulfillment process, including resource contention, batching delays, priority interruptions, and regulatory limits.
2. **Agent-Based Simulation:** Model individual orders as agents interacting with shared resources and constraints.

**Aspects to Focus On:**

- **Resource Contention:** Simulate the availability and allocation of cold-packing stations and other shared resources.
- **Batching Delays:** Model the formation and processing of batches, including the impact on waiting times.
- **Priority Interruptions:** Simulate the impact of express orders on standard orders.
- **Regulatory Limits:** Ensure the simulation respects the limits on hazardous material processing.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Key Metrics and Dashboards:**

1. **Queue Lengths for Shared Resources:** Monitor the average and maximum queue lengths for cold-packing stations.
2. **Batch Formation Times:** Track the average time taken to form a batch and the number of orders waiting for batch completion.
3. **Compliance with Hazardous Material Limits:** Monitor the number of hazardous material orders processed simultaneously and ensure compliance with regulatory limits.
4. **Order Throughput:** Measure the total number of orders processed per unit time and compare it to pre-implementation levels.
5. **Waiting Times:** Track the average waiting times for each activity, differentiating between within-instance and between-instance factors.

**Process Mining Dashboards:**

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Use dashboards to monitor key metrics in real-time, allowing for quick identification and resolution of bottlenecks.
- **Historical Analysis:** Compare post-implementation performance with historical data to assess the effectiveness of the optimization strategies.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Use predictive models to forecast future demand and adjust resource allocation accordingly.

By implementing these strategies and continuously monitoring the process, the fulfillment center can effectively manage instance-spanning constraints, improve overall performance, and meet delivery deadlines more consistently.
