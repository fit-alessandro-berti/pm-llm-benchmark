Based on the scenario, here is the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process. The reasoning for each constraint is provided in the code comments.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # Equivalence: If A occurs, it has the same number of occurrences as B.
    # We assume no activities are strictly equivalent. For instance, a quality
    # check (QC) could fail, preventing the packing (PO) from happening,
    # so they are not equivalent. A label (GSL) might be generated but a
    # system error could prevent the dispatch (D) from being logged in the same case.
    'equivalence': set(),

    # Always Before: If the first activity occurs, the second must have occurred previously.
    # This defines the pre-requisites for each step in the process.
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),  # To Check Availability, an Order must have been Received.
        ('RI', 'CA'),  # To Reserve Items, Availability must have been Checked.
        ('PI', 'RI'),  # To Pick Items, they must have been Reserved.
        ('QC', 'PI'),  # To perform a Quality Check, Items must have been Picked.
        ('PO', 'QC'),  # To Pack the Order, it must have passed the Quality Check.
        ('GSL', 'PO'), # To Generate a Shipping Label, the Order must have been Packed.
        ('D', 'GSL'),  # To Dispatch, a Shipping Label must have been Generated.
        ('IC', 'D'),   # To Invoice the Customer, the order must have been Dispatched (a common business rule).
        ('RP', 'IC')   # To Record Payment, an Invoice must have been sent.
    },

    # Always After: If the first activity occurs, the second must occur at some point later.
    # This defines the mandatory subsequent steps (commitments).
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receiving an Order commits to Checking Availability.
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserving Items commits to Picking them.
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Picking Items commits to a Quality Check.
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # A successful Quality Check commits to Packing the Order.
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Packing an Order commits to Generating a Shipping Label.
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Generating a Label commits to Dispatching the package.
        ('D', 'IC')    # Dispatching the order commits to Invoicing the Customer.
        # Note: (CA, RI) is not here because if items are unavailable, reservation doesn't happen.
        # Note: (IC, RP) is not here because the customer might not pay.
    },

    # Never Together: The two activities cannot co-exist in the same case.
    # In this scenario, all described activities can potentially belong to the same successful case.
    'never_together': set(),

    # Activity Occurrences: Bounds the number of occurrences for an activity in a case.
    # We assume no rework loops are described, so each activity happens at most once.
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},      # Every case must start with exactly one Receive Order event.
        'CA': {0, 1},   # May not happen if the process is aborted early.
        'RI': {0, 1},   # Might not happen if stock is unavailable.
        'PI': {0, 1},   # All subsequent fulfillment steps are optional.
        'QC': {0, 1},
        'PO': {0, 1},
        'GSL': {0, 1},
        'D': {0, 1},
        'IC': {0, 1},
        'RP': {0, 1}    # Payment is not guaranteed, so it can occur 0 or 1 time.
    },
    
    # Directly-Follows Constraints: If A occurs, B must occur immediately after.
    # This captures the most tightly-coupled steps in the process flow.
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),   # Checking availability is the immediate response to a new order.
        ('CA', 'RI'),   # Reservation immediately follows a successful availability check.
        ('PI', 'QC'),   # Picked items go directly to quality control.
        ('QC', 'PO'),   # QC-passed items go directly to packing.
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # A packed order is immediately ready for label generation.
        ('GSL', 'D')    # A labeled package is immediately dispatched.
    }
}

# You can print the dictionary to verify its structure.
# import json
# print(json.dumps(log_skeleton, default=list, indent=2))
