To infer the case groupings (i.e., which events belong to the same patient journey), we need to analyze the sequence of events based on shared attributes such as `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and logical activity flow. Each case corresponds to a distinct patient, so events with matching `patient_age` and `patient_gender` that follow a coherent sequence of activities likely belong to the same case.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. **Identify Unique Patients**
   - Each patient can be uniquely identified by their `patient_age` and `patient_gender`. These attributes remain consistent across all events for a given patient.
   - From the data:
     - Patient 1: Age = 45, Gender = M
     - Patient 2: Age = 62, Gender = F
     - Patient 3: Age = 28, Gender = M

#### 2. **Group Events by Patient**
   - Using `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, we can assign each event to one of the three patients.

#### 3. **Validate Logical Activity Flow**
   - For each patient, ensure the sequence of activities follows a logical progression typical of hospital processes:
     - Registration → Triage → Consultation → Tests/Procedures → Discharge.
   - This helps confirm that events are correctly grouped.

### Grouped Cases:

#### **Case 1: Patient Age = 45, Gender = M**
   - **Events:**
     1. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M`
     4. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z, activity: Initial triage, resource: Nurse Joy, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M`
     7. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M`
     12. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M`
     15. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M`

   - **Logical Flow:** Registration → Triage → X-ray Imaging → Doctor Consultation → Discharge.

#### **Case 2: Patient Age = 62, Gender = F**
   - **Events:**
     2. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F`

#### **Case 3: Patient Age = 28, Gender = M**
   - **Events:**
     3. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M`
     6. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M`
     9. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Surgery preparation, resource: Surgical Nurse, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M`
     13. `timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, activity: Surgery performed, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M`

### Final Case Groupings:
1. **Case 1 (Patient Age = 45, Gender = M):** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
2. **Case 2 (Patient Age = 62, Gender = F):** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
3. **Case 3 (Patient Age = 28, Gender = M):** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  

### Boxed Answer:
```plaintext
Case 1 (Age = 45, Gender = M): Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
Case 2 (Age = 62, Gender = F): Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
Case 3 (Age = 28, Gender = M): Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
