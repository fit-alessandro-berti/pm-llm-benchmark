### Analysis and Naming Choices

1. **Initiate Request:**
   - Initial submission of a request.
   
2. **Verify Documents:**
   - First verification (when documents are initially checked).
   - Re-verification (after additional information is provided).

3. **Call Customer:**
   - Initial call to clarify or obtain missing information.
   - Follow-up call after internal adjustments.

4. **Adjust Account:**
   - Internal adjustment made based on the initial call or additional information.

5. **Approve Request:**
   - Final approval step, regardless of context.

### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Verify Initial Documents (C001, C002, C003):**
   - The first instance of "Verify Documents" in each case is related to the initial submission or walk-in request and therefore, I named it "Verify Initial Documents."

2. **Verify Rechecked Documents:**
   - When documents are verified again after additional information has been provided or adjustments have been made internally, this activity is contextually different from the initial verification. Hence, it's renamed as "Verify Rechecked Documents."

3. **Call Customer:**
   - The first call typically happens to clarify or obtain missing information and hence is named "Call Customer."
   - Subsequent calls after internal adjustments are referred to as "Follow-up Call" to disambiguate the context.

4. **Adjust Account:**
   - This activity clearly indicates an internal adjustment made based on initial calls or additional documents, so itâ€™s renamed accordingly.

5. **Approve Request (C001, C002, C003):**
   - The final step in each case is the approval of the request and remains unchanged as "Approve Request" since the context does not change here.

By renaming these activities, we clearly capture their contextual differences within the process flow.
