This is a process diagram (workflow) with an inset legend showing three gateway types (XOR / AND / OR) for splits and joins. The main flow reads left  right:

- a (register request) is the start activity. From a the flow is routed out to several examination activities.
- There are three examination/check tasks:
  - b: examine thoroughly
  - c: examine casually
  - d: check ticket
  These tasks are reached from a through routing nodes (the small black connector dots shown in the diagram).
- The results of those examinations flow into e (decide), again via routing/join nodes. From e the process can take different outcomes:
  - If the decision leads to compensation, the flow goes to g (pay compensation).
  - If the decision rejects the request, the flow goes to h (reject request).
  g and h then converge and forward to z (end).
- There is a rework loop: e (or the earlier activities) can route to f (reinitiate request), which loops the case back into the examination branch(es) so the request is reprocessed.
- The inset at the lower right illustrates the graphical convention used for splits and joins: XOR-split / XOR-join (exclusive choice), AND-split / AND-join (parallel), and OR-split / OR-join (inclusive).

Overall the diagram models a request-registration workflow with multiple possible examination paths (which can be split/joined in different ways), a decision point that can result in compensation, rejection, or reinitiation (loop), and a final end state.
