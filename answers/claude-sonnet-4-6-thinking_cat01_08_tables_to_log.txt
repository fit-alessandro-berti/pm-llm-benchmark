# Process Mining Event Log

## Assumptions & Notes

1. **One event per item pick**: Each row in `Order Lines` generates a distinct "Items Picked" event since picks can occur at different times and by different warehouse staff.
2. **One event per delivery leg**: Each delivery record generates both an "Order Dispatched" and an "Order Arrived" event, tagged with the `delivery_id` to distinguish multiple shipments for the same order.
3. **One event per invoice**: Each row in the `Invoice` table becomes an "Invoice Issued" event.
4. **One event per payment**: Each row in the `Payments` table becomes a "Payment Received" event, linked back to the order via `invoice_id  order_id`.
5. **Order 1004**: No delivery, invoice, or payment records exist. Events are included up to the last available step (item picking). This may indicate an incomplete or in-progress case.
6. **Resource for Payment Received**: No human actor is explicitly recorded; the payment method/system is noted instead.
7. **Resource for dispatched/arrived events**: The carrier is treated as the responsible resource/actor.
8. **All timestamps are in UTC (Z suffix).**

> **Note on Order 1004**: This case appears incomplete in the source data — no delivery, invoice, or payment records exist. It is included as-is, which may indicate a pending, cancelled, or in-progress order. Process mining tools will naturally flag this as a deviant or incomplete trace.
