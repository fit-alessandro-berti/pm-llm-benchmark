 This data represents a series of events and their respective frequencies, durations, and relationships within a logistics or warehouse management system. The objects in question are Forklifts, Customer Orders, and Transport Documents.

1. **Forklift**: The main actions involve bringing forklifts to the loading bay, weighing items, placing items in stock, loading items to vehicles, and moving between these stations. There are multiple events happening simultaneously, with some objects (like forklifts) being used in more than one action. For example, a forklift might bring an object to the loading bay, load it onto a vehicle, and then move to another task (weighing or placing in stock).

2. **Customer Order**: The customer places an order, which triggers the creation of a Transport Document. This document is later used to book vehicles, reschedule containers, and eventually depart with the loaded items.

3. **Transport Document**: After creating a transport document from a customer order, it is used to book vehicles, order empty containers, and eventually depart with the loaded goods. There are also instances of rescheduling containers, which could indicate changes in the transportation schedule or delays.

The process underlying this data might be as follows:

1. A customer places an order, creating a new Customer Order object.
2. This Customer Order object is used to create a Transport Document.
3. The Transport Document is then used to book vehicles (triggering events like Load to Vehicle and Book Vehicles). At this stage, empty containers might also be ordered.
4. While booking vehicles, there may be instances of rescheduling containers, which could mean that the vehicle's schedule needs to change for various reasons (e.g., traffic, delays, or unforeseen circumstances).
5. With the booked vehicles, forklifts are used to move items (like loading them onto vehicles) as part of fulfilling the customer order. The items are weighed, placed in stock, and loaded onto vehicles at various stages.
6. Once all items are loaded onto a vehicle, the transport document departs with the loaded goods. There may be further rescheduling or delays along the way, indicated by Reschedule Container events.
