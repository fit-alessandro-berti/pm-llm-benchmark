Here is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints designed to mitigate bias in the loan application process:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # New constraint to ensure manual review exists
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        # Ensure that if sensitive information is disclosed, a manual review must exist
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New constraint to ensure manual review coexists with decisions for sensitive applicants
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Female": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Female": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New constraint to ensure a BiasMitigationCheck follows sensitive attribute checks
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # Ensure that a BiasMitigationCheck must precede any decision
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},

    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Prevent direct succession from sensitive attribute check to decision
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        # Prevent direct succession from sensitive attribute to decision
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Existence of Manual Review:** A `ManualReview` activity is added to ensure that every application has the opportunity for human review, which can help mitigate biases.

2. **Coexistence with Sensitive Applicants:** This constraint ensures that any decision (approve or reject) for applicants from sensitive demographic groups must coexist with a `ManualReview`. This promotes fairness by ensuring that decisions affecting sensitive groups are not made without oversight.

3. **Responded Existence:** If sensitive attributes like race or gender are checked, a `ManualReview` must exist in the process trace. This helps to verify that decisions are not made solely based on these attributes.

4. **Response and Precedence:** These constraints enforce that after checking sensitive attributes, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must be performed before making any decision. This step can include procedures to ensure the decision-making process is unbiased.

5. **Succession and Non-succession Constraints:** These prevent the immediate transition from checking sensitive attributes to rejecting an application, ensuring there are steps in between to mitigate bias. The `support: 0.0` in succession indicates that the constraint is not supported (i.e., it should not happen), while `support: 1.0` in non-succession means it should happen that these activities do not directly follow each other.

By introducing these constraints, the process model now has built-in checks to ensure that decisions are made in a manner that is less susceptible to bias against applicants based on their sensitive attributes. This promotes fairness and transparency in the loan application process.
