Based on the provided scenario of a complex global supply chain for high-tech electronics, here is a Python dictionary representing the estimated temporal profile. The times are in seconds and reflect the significant delays and variability inherent in such a process, from international procurement to post-sale support.

The dictionary includes pairs of activities that are both directly sequential and separated by multiple intermediate steps.

```python
# Temporal Profile for a Global High-Tech Electronics Supply Chain
# All time values (average and standard deviation) are in seconds.

# Time unit conversions for reference:
# 1 hour = 3,600 seconds
# 1 day = 86,400 seconds
# 1 week = 604,800 seconds
# 1 month (30 days) = 2,592,000 seconds

temporal_profile = {
    # --- Early Phase: Procurement ---
    # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: An administrative step, can take a few days of negotiation.
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 86400),  # Avg: 2 days, StDev: 1 day

    # Order Placement to Receive Components: The longest and most variable step, involving manufacturing and global shipping.
    ('OP', 'RC'): (3628800, 1209600), # Avg: 6 weeks, StDev: 2 weeks

    # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: The total time from selecting a supplier to getting parts.
    ('SS', 'RC'): (3801600, 1212800), # Avg: ~6.3 weeks, StDev: ~2 weeks (variances combined)

    # --- Middle Phase: Manufacturing ---
    # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: Should be quick, moving from loading dock to inspection queue.
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 21600), # Avg: 12 hours, StDev: 6 hours

    # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: Moving from inspection to the assembly line.
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 7200), # Avg: 4 hours, StDev: 2 hours

    # Component Assembly to Product Testing: The duration of the assembly process itself.
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 43200), # Avg: 3 days, StDev: 12 hours

    # Product Testing to Packaging: The duration of the testing cycle.
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 28800), # Avg: 1 day, StDev: 8 hours
    
    # Order Placement to Product Testing: A long-range pair spanning procurement and assembly.
    ('OP', 'PT'): (4020800, 1213700), # Avg: ~46 days, StDev: ~14 days

    # --- Late Phase: Distribution and Support ---
    # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: A quick, final internal transfer.
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600), # Avg: 2 hours, StDev: 1 hour

    # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: Time spent waiting for a shipment order. Can be highly variable.
    ('WS', 'DT'): (432000, 345600), # Avg: 5 days, StDev: 4 days

    # Distribution to After-Sales Support: Time from shipment until a customer's first support request. Highly variable.
    ('DT', 'AS'): (5184000, 3888000), # Avg: 2 months, StDev: 1.5 months
    
    # --- Full Process Span Examples ---
    # Quality Inspection to Distribution: The entire in-house manufacturing and storage cycle.
    ('QI', 'DT'): (799200, 349500), # Avg: ~9.25 days, StDev: ~4 days

    # Supplier Selection to Distribution: The entire process from starting procurement to shipping the final product.
    ('SS', 'DT'): (4600800, 1262500), # Avg: ~53 days, StDev: ~14.6 days
}

# Example of how to access the data
# avg_time, stdev_time = temporal_profile[('OP', 'RC')]
# print(f"Average time between Order Placement and Receive Components: {avg_time/86400:.1f} days")
# print(f"Standard Deviation: {stdev_time/86400:.1f} days")
