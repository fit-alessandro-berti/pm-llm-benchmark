This visualization appears to be a workflow or process diagram that shows the handling of requests, with additional gateway notation definitions shown in a legend box at the bottom right.

The main diagram shows a process that starts with "register request" (node a) and ends with "end" (node z). The workflow includes several activities such as:
- "examine thoroughly" (node b)
- "examine casually" (node c)
- "check ticket" (node d)
- "decide" (node e)
- "reinitiate request" (node f)
- "pay compensation" (node g)
- "reject request" (node h)

The boxes in the gray legend area at the bottom right show different types of gateway notations:
- XOR-split and XOR-join
- AND-split and AND-join
- OR-split and OR-join

The diagram uses connecting lines and nodes to show the flow and relationships between different activities, with various splitting and merging paths representing different possible process flows.

This appears to be a business process model, possibly in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) format, showing how a request is processed through various examination and decision stages until it reaches completion.
