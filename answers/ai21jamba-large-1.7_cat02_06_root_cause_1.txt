### 1. **Identifying Cases with Longer Total Resolution Times**

To determine which cases took significantly longer to resolve, we calculate the total resolution time for each case. Resolution time is the time from receiving the ticket (first event) to closing the ticket (last event).

- **Case 101**: Total Time = 10:15 - 08:00 = **2 hours 15 minutes**
- **Case 102**: Total Time = 09:00 (03/02) - 08:05 (03/01) = **25 hours**
- **Case 103**: Total Time = 09:30 - 08:10 = **1 hour 20 minutes**
- **Case 104**: Total Time = 08:30 (03/02) - 08:20 (03/01) = **24 hours 10 minutes**
- **Case 105**: Total Time = 09:30 (03/03) - 08:25 (03/01) = **49 hours 5 minutes**

Cases **102, 104, and 105** took significantly longer than others.

### 2. **Identifying Potential Root Causes**

**Case 102:**

- **ESCALATION**: Escalation to Level-2 occurred at **09:00**, with a delay of 3 hours before the investigation began (**14:00**).
- **WAITING TIME**: After escalation, the investigation started nearly 27 hours later (**09:00, 03/02**). This indicates a bottleneck in handling escalated cases.

**Case 104:**

- **DELAY IN TR**: The ticket was received at **08:20** but not triaged until **09:00** (40-minute delay).
- **INVESTIGATION DELAY**: After triage, investigation started nearly 4 hours later (**13:00**).
- **TOTAL WAITING TIME**: Multiple long waiting times increased the resolution time, creating inefficiencies.

**Case 105:**

- **ESCALATION & DELAY**: Escalated to Level-2 at **10:00**, but the next activity occurred 28 hours later (**14:00, 03/02**).
- **FOLLOW-UP DELAY**: After escalation, the investigation and resolution took another 29 hours, highlighting poor handling post-escalation.

### 3. **Insights and Recommendations**

- **Reducing Escalation Handling Delays**: The significant delays post-escalation (Cases 102, 105) suggest inefficiencies in the Level-2 team’s response time or process. Streamlining the escalation workflow by defining specific service-level agreements (SLAs) for Level-2 handling could help reduce delays.
- **Optimizing Triage & Assignment**: The long waiting period between tasks (e.g., triaging and investigation in Case 104) indicates potential inefficiencies in resource allocation. Automating triage or introducing dedicated Level-1 agents to reduce this wait time would improve performance.
- **Addressing Systemic Delays**: A **"First-Response Time"** metric could highlight the time taken between ticket receipt and triage. Monitoring these early delays and addressing them (e.g., with SLA-driven routing) could speed up the process.
- **Continuous Process Monitoring**: Introducing a dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs), such as average resolution times and escalations per case, would help identify inefficiencies earlier.

By addressing these bottlenecks, the process can achieve faster cycle times, better customer experience, and greater operational efficiency.
