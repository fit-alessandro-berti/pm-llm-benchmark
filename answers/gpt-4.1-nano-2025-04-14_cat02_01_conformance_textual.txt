Let's analyze each case step-by-step against the normative process rules and expectations:

---

### **Normative Process Recap**

- The process always **begins with "Receive order".**
- After receiving the order, **"Check inventory"** must occur **before** any fulfillment decisions.
- If inventory is **sufficient**:
  - Followed by **"Authorize payment"**,
  - then **"Package items"**,
  - then **"Ship order"**,
  - and finally **"Close order"**.
- If inventory is **insufficient**:
  - The process should directly go from **"Check inventory"** to **"Cancel order"**,
  - then **"Close order"**.
- Violations include:
  - Shipping **before** "Package items" or **after** a cancellation.
  - Authorizing payment **before** checking inventory.
  - Packaging **before** payment authorization.
  - Continuing fulfillment activities after cancellation.
  - Any activity out of sequence or activity that violates the logical flow.

### **Case-by-Case Analysis**

#### **Case 1**

| Activity             | Sequence                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Receive order        | 09:00                                     |
| Check inventory      | 10:00                                     |
| Authorize payment    | 11:00                                     |
| Package items        | 12:00                                     |
| Ship order           | 13:00                                     |
| Close order          | 14:00                                     |

**Analysis:**
- Sequence: **Correct.**  
- "Check inventory" before "Authorize payment," followed by packaging, shipping, and closing.  
- **No violations.**

#### **Case 2**

| Activity             | Sequence                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Receive order        | 09:00                                    |
| Check inventory      | 09:30                                    |
| Package items        | 10:00                                    |
| Authorize payment    | 10:30                                    |
| Ship order           | 11:00                                    |
| Close order          | 11:30                                    |

**Analysis:**
- **Violation identified:**
  - "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment."  
- **Expected:** "Authorize payment" should happen **after** "Check inventory," **and** before "Package items."  
- **Violation:** Packaging **before** payment authorization.

**Note:**  
- The sequence with packaging before authorization **contradicts** the normative process rules.

#### **Case 3**

| Activity             | Sequence                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Receive order        | 09:00                                    |
| Check inventory      | 09:20                                    |
| Authorize payment    | 09:40                                    |
| Cancel order         | 10:00                                    |
| Ship order           | 10:30                                    |
| Close order          | 11:00                                    |

**Analysis:**
- **Violation identified:**
  - "Ship order" occurs **after** "Cancel order."  
- **According to the rules:**  
  - After "Cancel order," no further fulfillment activities like "Ship order" should occur.  
- **Issue:** Shipping **after cancellation** is illogical and violates the process.  
- **Possible interpretation:** The sequence suggests a logical inconsistency or error; perhaps "Ship order" was performed **before** cancellation, but as recorded, it occurs **after**.

#### **Case 4**

| Activity             | Sequence                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Receive order        | 09:00                                    |
| Check inventory      | 09:10                                    |
| Cancel order         | 09:20                                    |
| Close order          | 09:50                                    |

**Analysis:**
- Sequence: **Receive  Check  Cancel  Close**  
- **According to the specified rules:**
  - After "Check inventory," if items are insufficient, **"Cancel order"** should be performed, which it is.
  - The process then proceeds to **"Close order."**  
- **No violations.**

#### **Case 5**

| Activity             | Sequence                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Receive order        | 09:00                                    |
| Check inventory      | 10:00                                    |
| Authorize payment    | 10:30                                    |
| Ship order           | 11:00                                    |
| Close order          | 11:30                                    |

**Analysis:**
- Sequence: **Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close**
- **Consistent with the process:**
  - Inventory check followed by payment authorization, then shipping, then closing.
- **No violations.**

### **Summary of Violations**

| Case ID | Violation(s) Summary                                                   | Explanation                                                                                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2**     | Packaging occurs **before** payment authorization.                       | Contradicts the expected sequence: after "Check inventory," "Authorize payment" should come before "Package items."   |
| **3**     | Shipping occurs **after** "Cancel order."                                | Violates the rule that once an order is canceled, fulfillment activities like shipment should not continue.           |

---

### **Final Remarks**

- **Cases 1, 4, and 5** are **compliant** with the normative process as described.
- **Cases 2 and 3** **deviate** from the process flow:
  - **Case 2:** Packaging should come after payment authorization, but it occurs before.
  - **Case 3:** Shipping should not occur after cancellation, but it does.

This precise analysis helps identify where the actual process execution diverges from the intended normative flow, enabling targeted process improvement or compliance checking.
