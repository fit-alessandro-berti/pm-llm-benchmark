The provided visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram, which represents a sequence of processes or workflows. Here is a detailed description of the diagram:

### Top Section:
1. **Start Event**: The process begins with a start event labeled "New credit application received."

2. **Task**: The first task is "Check customer credit history."

3. **Gateway**: A decision gateway follows, which splits into two paths:
   - **Path 1**: If the credit history is not okay, the process goes to "Send credit denial."
   - **Path 2**: If the credit history is okay, the process proceeds to "Review credit application."

4. **Task**: "Review credit application."

5. **Gateway**: Another decision gateway follows, which splits into two paths:
   - **Path 1**: If the application is not approved, the process goes to "Send credit denial."
   - **Path 2**: If the application is approved, the process goes to "Send credit approval."

6. **End Event**: Both paths eventually lead to an end event.

### Bottom Section:
1. **Start Event**: The process begins with a start event labeled "New credit application received."

2. **Task**: The first task is "Check customer credit history."

3. **Gateway**: A decision gateway follows, which splits into two paths:
   - **Path 1**: If the credit history is not okay, the process goes to "Send credit denial."
   - **Path 2**: If the credit history is okay, the process proceeds to "Review credit application."

4. **Task**: "Review credit application."

5. **Gateway**: Another decision gateway follows, which splits into two paths:
   - **Path 1**: If the application is not approved, the process goes to "Send credit denial."
   - **Path 2**: If the application is approved, the process goes to "Send credit approval."

6. **End Event**: Both paths eventually lead to an end event.

### Key Elements:
- **Start Events**: Indicated by circles with a single line.
- **Tasks**: Represented by rectangles.
- **Gateways**: Diamonds that represent decision points where the process can diverge or converge.
- **End Events**: Circles with a double line indicating the end of the process.

### Flow:
- The process starts with a credit application being received.
- The customer's credit history is checked.
- Based on the credit history, the application is either denied or reviewed further.
- If reviewed, the application is either approved or denied.
- The final decision is communicated to the customer.

### Pools and Lanes:
- The diagram is divided into two horizontal sections, likely representing different departments or roles, but they are not explicitly labeled in the provided image.

This BPMN diagram effectively models the decision-making process for credit applications, showing how decisions are made at each step and how the process flows based on those decisions.
