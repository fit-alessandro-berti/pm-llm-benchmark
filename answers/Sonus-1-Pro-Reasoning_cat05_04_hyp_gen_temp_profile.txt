Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model
('R', 'P') - Receive to Approve:

Average Time: 25 hours (90000 seconds)
Standard Deviation: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
Anomaly: The very low standard deviation suggests a highly consistent and possibly artificial approval process. In a typical insurance claim process, the time to approve a claim can vary significantly based on the complexity of the claim, the availability of necessary information, and the workload of the adjusters.
('P', 'N') - Approve to Notify:

Average Time: 7 days (604800 seconds)
Standard Deviation: 2 days (172800 seconds)
Anomaly: The long average delay and high standard deviation indicate significant variability in the time it takes to notify customers after approval. This could suggest bottlenecks in the notification process, resource constraints, or delays in finalizing the necessary documentation.
('A', 'C') - Assign to Close:

Average Time: 2 hours (7200 seconds)
Standard Deviation: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
Anomaly: The quick closure after assignment, without consistent evaluation or approval steps, suggests that some claims might be prematurely closed. This could be due to errors in the process, system issues, or shortcuts taken by adjusters.
('E', 'N') - Evaluate to Notify:

Average Time: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
Standard Deviation: 1 minute (60 seconds)
Anomaly: The very short time between evaluation and notification is unusually quick and might indicate that the notification process is automated and possibly skipping necessary reviews or steps.
Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Might Exist
('R', 'P') - Receive to Approve:

Hypothesis: The low standard deviation might be due to an automated approval process or a strict policy that forces approvals to happen at a specific time to meet service level agreements (SLAs). Alternatively, it could be a result of a simplified or streamlined process for certain types of claims, but this would be unusual for a diverse set of claims.
('P', 'N') - Approve to Notify:

Hypothesis: The long delay and high standard deviation could be due to a backlog in the notification process, where the team responsible for notifications is understaffed or overwhelmed. It could also be a result of batching notifications to optimize resource usage or waiting for additional information before notifying the customer.
('A', 'C') - Assign to Close:

Hypothesis: The quick closure after assignment might indicate that some claims are being closed without going through all necessary steps like evaluation or approval. This could be due to errors in the process, where claims are mistakenly closed early, or there might be a shortcut in the system that allows adjusters to close claims prematurely.
('E', 'N') - Evaluate to Notify:

Hypothesis: The very short time between evaluation and notification suggests that the notification process is highly automated and possibly skips additional reviews or steps. This could be due to a system configuration that triggers notification immediately after evaluation, which might not align with the business rules requiring additional checks.
Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries
('R', 'P') - Receive to Approve:

Query to Verify Consistency:
sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS receive_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM
    claim_events ce1
JOIN
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN
    claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE
    ce1.activity = 'R'
    AND ce2.activity = 'P'
ORDER BY
    time_diff_seconds;
Explanation: This query lists the time differences between receiving and approving claims, helping to verify if the low standard deviation is consistent across all claims.
('P', 'N') - Approve to Notify:

Query to Identify Long Delays:
sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    c.claim_type
FROM
    claim_events ce1
JOIN
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN
    claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN
    adjusters a ON c.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
WHERE
    ce1.activity = 'P'
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
ORDER BY
    time_diff_seconds DESC;
Explanation: This query identifies claims with the longest delays between approval and notification, and correlates them with specific adjusters and claim types to identify patterns or resource constraints.
('A', 'C') - Assign to Close:

Query to Identify Premature Closures:
sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) AS eval_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) AS approve_count
FROM
    claim_events ce1
JOIN
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN
    claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce.timestamp BETWEEN ce1.timestamp AND ce2.timestamp
WHERE
    ce1.activity = 'A'
    AND ce2.activity = 'C'
GROUP BY
    c.claim_id, ce1.timestamp, ce2.timestamp
HAVING
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200 -- less than 2 hours
    AND (eval_count = 0 OR approve_count = 0)
ORDER BY
    time_diff_seconds;
Explanation: This query identifies claims closed quickly after assignment and checks if evaluation or approval steps were skipped, helping to verify if claims are being prematurely closed.
('E', 'N') - Evaluate to Notify:

Query to Verify Quick Notifications:
sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
    ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM
    claim_events ce1
JOIN
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN
    claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE
    ce1.activity = 'E'
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
ORDER BY
    time_diff_seconds;
Explanation: This query lists the time differences between evaluation and notification, helping to verify if the quick transitions are consistent and if any necessary steps are being skipped.
By running these queries, we can gather detailed data to verify the identified anomalies and gain insights into the underlying causes of the unusual temporal relationships in the insurance claim handling process.
