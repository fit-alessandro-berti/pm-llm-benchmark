We are going to create a temporal profile for the supply chain process with activities: 
 SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS.

 We consider that in a trace, for every pair of activities (A, B) such that A occurs before B, we have a temporal distance.

 We are to estimate the average time and standard deviation for each pair that we think is relevant.

 Note: The pairs are not only direct successors, but any two activities that occur in order.

 However, we are to create a representative subset. We can include pairs that are directly following and also some that are separated by one or more steps.

 Let's think about the process flow:

 1. Supplier Selection (SS) -> Order Placement (OP): This is usually a short time, maybe a day on average, with low deviation because it's a decision and then immediate action.

 2. Order Placement (OP) -> Receive Components (RC): This can be long and variable, depending on the supplier. Let's say average 30 days, but with a standard deviation of 7 days.

 3. Receive Components (RC) -> Quality Inspection (QI): This is usually immediate, maybe same day or next day. Let's say average 1 day, deviation 0.5 days.

 4. Quality Inspection (QI) -> Component Assembly (CA): If the components pass, then assembly starts soon. Maybe average 1 day, deviation 0.5 days.

 5. Component Assembly (CA) -> Product Testing (PT): This depends on the assembly line. Let's say average 2 days, deviation 1 day.

 6. Product Testing (PT) -> Packaging (PK): If the product passes, then packaging is quick. Maybe average 0.5 days, deviation 0.2 days.

 7. Packaging (PK) -> Warehouse Storage (WS): This is immediate, maybe same day. Average 0.2 days, deviation 0.1 days.

 8. Warehouse Storage (WS) -> Distribution (DT): This depends on the distribution schedule. Maybe average 2 days, deviation 1 day.

 9. Distribution (DT) -> After-Sales Support (AS): This can be a long time, because after-sales support happens after the product is sold and used. But note: the trace ends with DT and then AS might happen much later. However, in the context of the process, we might consider the time from distribution to the first after-sales support (which could be weeks or months). Let's be cautious and set average 30 days, deviation 10 days.

 Also, we can consider some non-adjacent pairs, for example:

 - SS -> RC: This would be the time from supplier selection to receiving components. This is roughly the time of SS->OP plus OP->RC. But note: in the temporal profile, we are looking at the time between the two events in the trace, so it's the sum of the intermediate steps? Not exactly, because the trace might have other activities in between? But in this case, the typical path is SS, OP, RC. So the time from SS to RC is the time from SS to OP plus OP to RC. However, we are to provide the average and stdev for the direct time between SS and RC in the trace (which in a typical trace would be the sum of the two, but note that the trace might have other activities in between? In this process, it's linear until RC). Let's assume the process is linear until RC, so the time from SS to RC is the sum of SS->OP and OP->RC. But note: the standard deviation of the sum of two independent random variables is the square root of the sum of the variances. However, we are not required to compute exactly, but to estimate.

 Alternatively, we can think of the typical time from SS to RC as 1 day (for SS->OP) + 30 days (for OP->RC) = 31 days, and the standard deviation as sqrt(0.5^2 + 7^2)  7.02 days. But note: the standard deviation of the sum of independent normal distributions is the square root of the sum of the variances. However, we are not sure of the independence and we are just estimating.

 But note: the problem says "the temporal profile is a model describing the average and the standard deviation of the times between couples of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution". So we are to provide the observed average and standard deviation for the time between the two activities in the trace, regardless of the path.

 Since we are to create a representative subset, we can include:

 - Directly consecutive pairs (as above).
 - Some pairs that are two steps apart, e.g., SS->RC, OP->QI, RC->CA, QI->PT, CA->PK, PT->WS, PK->DT, WS->AS.
 - And even some that are further apart, e.g., SS->QI, OP->CA, RC->PT, QI->PK, CA->WS, PT->DT, PK->AS, and so on.

 However, note that the temporal profile is built from the event logs, so we are to imagine what the typical times and deviations would be.

 We must be cautious: the further apart the activities, the more variable the time (because it's the sum of several steps). The average would be the sum of the averages of the intermediate steps, and the standard deviation would be the square root of the sum of the variances (if we assume independence). But note that in reality, the steps might not be independent.

 Let's decide on a set of pairs to include. We'll include:

 1. All consecutive pairs (8 pairs).
 2. Some pairs with one intermediate step (e.g., 7 pairs: skipping the immediate next, but note that we have 10 activities, so we can have 8 consecutive and then 7 with one intermediate, but let's not include all because the problem says "representative subset").
 3. Some pairs with two or more intermediate steps.

 We are to create a dictionary with a reasonable number of pairs, say 15-20.

 Let's list:

 Consecutive:
   ('SS', 'OP')
   ('OP', 'RC')
   ('RC', 'QI')
   ('QI', 'CA')
   ('CA', 'PT')
   ('PT', 'PK')
   ('PK', 'WS')
   ('WS', 'DT')
   ('DT', 'AS')

 Now, let's add some non-consecutive:

   ('SS', 'RC')   # SS->OP->RC
   ('OP', 'QI')   # OP->RC->QI
   ('RC', 'CA')   # RC->QI->CA
   ('QI', 'PT')   # QI->CA->PT
   ('CA', 'PK')   # CA->PT->PK
   ('PT', 'WS')   # PT->PK->WS
   ('PK', 'DT')   # PK->WS->DT
   ('WS', 'AS')   # WS->DT->AS

 And then some with two intermediate steps:

   ('SS', 'QI')   # SS->OP->RC->QI
   ('OP', 'CA')   # OP->RC->QI->CA
   ('RC', 'PT')   # RC->QI->CA->PT
   ('QI', 'PK')   # QI->CA->PT->PK
   ('CA', 'WS')   # CA->PT->PK->WS
   ('PT', 'DT')   # PT->PK->WS->DT
   ('PK', 'AS')   # PK->WS->DT->AS

 And even one with three intermediate steps:

   ('SS', 'CA')   # SS->OP->RC->QI->CA

 We don't want to include every possible pair because there are 10*9/2 = 45 pairs (if we consider only A before B). We are to provide a representative subset.

 Let's choose 20 pairs. We'll take:

 1. All consecutive pairs (9 pairs, because from SS to AS there are 9 edges? Actually, 10 activities, so 9 consecutive pairs? Let's count: 
    SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT, DT->AS -> 9 consecutive.

 2. Then, we'll choose 11 more that are non-consecutive, but that are likely to be of interest.

 We can choose:

   ('SS', 'RC')
   ('SS', 'QI')
   ('SS', 'CA')
   ('OP', 'QI')
   ('OP', 'CA')
   ('RC', 'CA')
   ('RC', 'PT')
   ('QI', 'PT')
   ('QI', 'PK')
   ('CA', 'PK')
   ('PT', 'WS')

 But note: we are to consider the complexity and the fact that the temporal profile is for any two activities that eventually follow.

 Let's assign the average and standard deviation for each pair.

 We'll base the consecutive pairs on the estimates we thought above, and for the non-consecutive, we'll approximate by adding the averages and using the square root of the sum of squares of standard deviations (assuming independence).

 However, note: the problem does not require us to compute exactly, but to estimate. So we can use our knowledge of the process.

 Let's write the consecutive pairs first:

   ('SS', 'OP'): (1 day, 0.5 days)   -> in seconds: (86400, 43200)
   ('OP', 'RC'): (30 days, 7 days) -> (2592000, 604800)
   ('RC', 'QI'): (1 day, 0.5 days) -> (86400, 43200)
   ('QI', 'CA'): (1 day, 0.5 days) -> (86400, 43200)
   ('CA', 'PT'): (2 days, 1 day) -> (172800, 86400)
   ('PT', 'PK'): (0.5 days, 0.2 days) -> (43200, 17280)
   ('PK', 'WS'): (0.2 days, 0.1 days) -> (17280, 8640)
   ('WS', 'DT'): (2 days, 1 day) -> (172800, 86400)
   ('DT', 'AS'): (30 days, 10 days) -> (2592000, 864000)

 Now, for the non-consecutive, we can compute:

 Example: ('SS', 'RC') = SS->OP + OP->RC = (1 day + 30 days, sqrt(0.5^2 + 7^2) days) = (31 days, ~7.04 days) -> (2678400, 608256) seconds.

 But note: we are to provide in seconds, so we can convert days to seconds (1 day = 86400 seconds).

 Alternatively, we can compute in seconds from the beginning.

 Let's do:

   ('SS', 'RC'): 
        average = 86400 + 2592000 = 2678400 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(43200^2 + 604800^2) = sqrt(1866240000 + 365783040000) = sqrt(367649280000)  606360.0 seconds

 But note: 7 days in seconds is 604800, and 0.5 days is 43200. So the variance of SS->OP is (43200)^2 and OP->RC is (604800)^2.

 However, let's round to reasonable numbers.

 We'll do the same for the others.

 Alternatively, we can use our domain knowledge to adjust. For example, the time from SS to RC might be more variable because of the supplier, so we might set a higher standard deviation.

 Let's create the dictionary with 20 pairs:

 We have 9 consecutive, and we'll add 11 non-consecutive.

 We'll choose the non-consecutive pairs and compute:

   ('SS', 'QI'): SS->OP + OP->RC + RC->QI = (1+30+1=32 days, sqrt(0.5^2+7^2+0.5^2)=sqrt(0.25+49+0.25)=sqrt(49.5)7.04 days) -> (32*86400, 7.04*86400) = (2764800, 608256)

   Similarly, we can do for others.

 But note: we are not limited to linearity. The process might have parallel steps or loops, but in this scenario we assume linear for simplicity.

 Let's list the 20 pairs we want to include:

 Consecutive (9):
   ('SS','OP'), ('OP','RC'), ('RC','QI'), ('QI','CA'), ('CA','PT'), ('PT','PK'), ('PK','WS'), ('WS','DT'), ('DT','AS')

 Non-consecutive (11):
   ('SS','RC'), ('SS','QI'), ('SS','CA'), ('OP','QI'), ('OP','CA'), ('RC','CA'), ('RC','PT'), ('QI','PT'), ('QI','PK'), ('CA','PK'), ('PT','WS')

 Now, let's compute the non-consecutive:

   ('SS','RC'): (31 days, 7.04 days) -> (2678400, 608256)
   ('SS','QI'): (32 days, 7.04 days) -> (2764800, 608256) [Note: same stdev as above because the additional 0.5 day stdev doesn't change much]
   ('SS','CA'): (33 days, 7.04 days) -> (2851200, 608256) [Again, same stdev? Actually, we are adding more steps, so the stdev should increase, but let's compute properly]

 Actually, for ('SS','CA'): 
   average = 1+30+1+1 = 33 days
   stdev = sqrt(0.5^2 + 7^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.25+49+0.25+0.25) = sqrt(49.75)  7.05 days -> (2851200, 609120)

 We see that the standard deviation doesn't change much because the OP->RC step dominates.

 So, for simplicity, we can round the standard deviation to 7 days for any pair that involves the OP->RC step and then add minor variations.

 Alternatively, we can set the standard deviation for non-consecutive pairs that include OP->RC to 7 days (604800 seconds) and for those that don't, we compute accordingly.

 But note: we are to estimate, so we can use:

   For any pair that includes the OP->RC step, the standard deviation is about 7 days (604800 seconds) and the average is the sum of the averages of the steps.

 However, let's compute each non-consecutive pair properly:

   ('OP','QI'): 
        average = 30+1 = 31 days -> 2678400 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(7^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(49+0.25)=7.02 days -> 606528 seconds

   ('OP','CA'):
        average = 30+1+1 = 32 days -> 2764800 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(7^2+0.5^2+0.5^2)=7.04 days -> 608256 seconds

   ('RC','CA'):
        average = 1+1 = 2 days -> 172800 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(0.5^2+0.5^2)=0.71 days -> 61344 seconds

   ('RC','PT'):
        average = 1+1+2 = 4 days -> 345600 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(0.5^2+0.5^2+1^2)=sqrt(0.25+0.25+1)=sqrt(1.5)=1.22 days -> 105408 seconds

   ('QI','PT'):
        average = 1+2 = 3 days -> 259200 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(0.5^2+1^2)=sqrt(0.25+1)=1.12 days -> 96768 seconds

   ('QI','PK'):
        average = 1+2+0.5 = 3.5 days -> 302400 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(0.5^2+1^2+0.2^2)=sqrt(0.25+1+0.04)=1.14 days -> 98496 seconds

   ('CA','PK'):
        average = 2+0.5 = 2.5 days -> 216000 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(1^2+0.2^2)=1.02 days -> 88128 seconds

   ('PT','WS'):
        average = 0.5+0.2 = 0.7 days -> 60480 seconds
        stdev = sqrt(0.2^2+0.1^2)=0.22 days -> 19008 seconds

 We have the consecutive ones and these 11 non-consecutive.

 Now, let's write the dictionary in seconds.

 We'll convert days to seconds by multiplying by 86400.

 We'll round the seconds to integers.

 Let's create the dictionary:

 Note: We are to provide the average and standard deviation in seconds.

 We'll write:

 temporal_profile = {
    # Consecutive
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 43200),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (2592000, 604800),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 43200),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 86400),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 17280),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (17280, 8640),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000),

    # Non-consecutive
    ('SS', 'RC'): (2678400, 608256),
    ('SS', 'QI'): (2764800, 608256),
    ('SS', 'CA'): (2851200, 609120),
    ('OP', 'QI'): (2678400, 606528),
    ('OP', 'CA'): (2764800, 608256),
    ('RC', 'CA'): (172800, 61344),
    ('RC', 'PT'): (345600, 105408),
    ('QI', 'PT'): (259200, 96768),
    ('QI', 'PK'): (302400, 98496),
    ('CA', 'PK'): (216000, 88128),
    ('PT', 'WS'): (60480, 19008)
 }

 This gives 20 pairs.

 We note that the standard deviations for the non-consecutive pairs that involve the long supplier step (OP->RC) are dominated by that step, and the others are computed by the square root of the sum of variances.

 We think this is a representative subset.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

Here's a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct procurement sequence
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 10800),       # 1 day ± 3 hours
    ('OP', 'RC'): (2592000, 432000),    # 30 days ± 5 days
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 3600),        # 4 hours ± 1 hour
    
    # Manufacturing sequence
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 7200),        # 12 hours ± 2 hours
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 14400),       # 1 day ± 4 hours
    
    # Post-production sequence
    ('PT', 'PK'): (21600, 5400),        # 6 hours ± 1.5 hours

    # Cross-process pairs (non-adjacent)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (2635200, 442800),    # ~30.5 days ± 5.1 days
    ('OP', 'CA'): (2635200, 439200),    # ~30.5 days ± 5.1 days
    ('RC', 'PT'): (129600, 21600),      # 1.5 days ± 6 hours
    ('QI', 'PK'): (151200, 23400),      # ~1.75 days ± 6.5 hours
    ('CA', 'WS'): (115200, 19800),      # ~1.3 days ± 5.5 hours
    
    # Long-range pairs
    ('SS', 'PT'): (2721600, 453600),    # ~31.5 days ± 5.25 days
    ('OP', 'PK'): (2714400, 450000),    # ~31.4 days ± 5.2 days
    ('RC', 'WS'): (136800, 23400),      # ~1.6 days ± 6.5 hours
    ('QI', 'DT'): (345600, 64800),      # 4 days ± 18 hours
    ('CA', 'AS'): (2678400, 878400),    # ~31 days ± 10.2 days
    
    # Very long-range pairs
    ('SS', 'DT'): (2764800, 475200),    # ~32 days ± 5.5 days
    ('OP', 'AS'): (5184000, 1296000),   # ~60 days ± 15 days
    ('RC', 'AS'): (2592000, 907200),    # ~30 days ± 10.5 days
    ('QI', 'AS'): (2563200, 900000),    # ~29.7 days ± 10.4 days
}
```

This temporal profile captures:

1. **Direct sequential relationships** between adjacent activities with realistic timeframes
2. **Cross-process dependencies** where activities are separated by intermediate steps
3. **Long-range temporal relationships** that span multiple process stages
4. **Variability** reflecting real-world uncertainties in supply chain operations

The profile shows how delays can propagate through the supply chain, with procurement activities (SSOPRC) having the highest variability due to external supplier dependencies, while internal manufacturing steps (QICAPT) show more consistent timing. The after-sales support (AS) activity has wide variability since it occurs long after the core manufacturing process.
