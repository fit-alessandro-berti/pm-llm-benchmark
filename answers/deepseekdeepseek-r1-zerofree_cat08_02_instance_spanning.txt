**1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact:**
   - **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:**
     - **Identification and Impact Measurement:**
       - Use process mining to identify all instances where orders require cold-packing (i.e., "Requires Cold Packing" = TRUE in the event log). Aggregate the cases where the "Packing" activity uses a "Cold-Packing" station (e.g., "Station C2"). Analyze the waiting time from the "Item Picking" completion until the "Packing" start for cold-packing orders. 
       - **Metrics:** Waiting time due to resource contention for cold-packing stations, queue length, and "Station C" utilization rates.
     
     - **Distinguishing Waiting Times:** By comparing the timestamp when "Item Picking" is completed ("COMPLETE") with the timestamp when "Packing" starts ("START") for orders needing cold-packing, any significant gap might be attributed to waiting for an available cold-packing station. Similarly, within-instance waiting (such as long "Packing" activity duration) can be identified by the "Packing" activity itself ("START" to "COMPLETE" timestamps).

   - **Batching for Shipping:**
     - **Identification and Impact Measurement:**
       - Group orders by "Batch ID" (e.g., "B1") and "Destination Region." Examine the waiting times between the "Quality Check" completion and the "Shipping Label Generation" start (batch formation time).
       - **Metrics:** Waiting time for batch formation, batch size distribution by "Destination Region," and average time from "Quality Check" completion to "Batch Start."

     - **Distinguishing Waiting Times:** If there's a significant gap between "Quality Check" completion and the start of "Shipping Label Generation," this may be due to waiting for a batch to form. The within-instance waiting here is the actual "Shipping Label Gen." activity duration ("START" to "COMPLETE").

   - **Priority Order Handling:**
     - **Identification and Impact Measurement:**
       - Track "Order Type" ("Standard" vs. "Express"). For standard orders, check for cases where activities such as "Packing" or "Quality Check" are interrupted (multiple "START" events for the same activity might indicate an interruption).
       - **Metrics:** Pause durations in standard order processing due to express order preemption, total processing time for express orders compared to standard orders, and the interruption frequency and duration for standard orders.

     - **Distinguishing Waiting Times:** Any "paused" time should be calculated based on the difference between the first "START" to "COMPLETE" total time minus the pure sum of "START" to "COMPLETE" segments if processing was uninterrupted.

   - **Regulatory Compliance on Hazardous Materials:**
     - **Identification and Impact Measurement:**
       - Identify orders where "Hazardous Material" = TRUE and monitor the "Packing" and "Quality Check" activities. Determine when there are more than 10 orders with hazardous materials simultaneously active in these stages.
       - **Metrics:** Waiting time until "Packing" or "Quality Check" starts for hazardous material orders, active count of "Hazardous Material" orders in "Packing" or "Quality Check."

     - **Distinguishing Waiting Times:** Similar to cold-packing stations, any waiting time ("Item Picking" until "Packing" start, or whatever precedes "Quality Check" until "Quality Check" starts) can be analyzed for such orders.

**2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions:**
    - An express order needing a cold-packing station might cause a longer queue for that limited resource, thus delaying other standard orders that need cold-packing. Another instance could be when batching multiple "Hazardous Material" orders for the same region might make them compete for the limited processing capacity (10-order limit), so batching could need to be adjusted to keep the number of "Hazardous Material" orders in check.
    
    - Understanding these interactions is crucial because one strategy to reduce batching delay might increase the risk of breaching regulatory limits on hazardous order processing. Priority handling might increase the queue times for other orders needing the same limited resources (e.g., cold-packing stations).

**3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies:**
    - **Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations**
      - **Addresses:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations.
      - **Specific Changes:** Allocate additional resources (temporary stations) during peak demand predicted via historical data.
      - **Leveraging Data/Analysis:** Process mining for demand forecasting.
      - **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced wait times for cold-packing stations.

    - **Strategy 2: Revised Batching Logic**
      - **Addresses:** Batching for Shipping.
      - **Specific Changes:** Batch either when a practical size is reached or after a predefined time limit is reached.
      - **Leveraging Data/Analysis:** Analyze batch formation times and adjust based on historical data.
      - **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced waiting times for "Shipping Label Generation."

    - **Strategy 3: Improved Scheduling Rules for Priority Handling and Hazardous Materials**
      - **Addresses:** Priority Order Handling and Regulatory Compliance.
      - **Specific Changes:** Implement a priority handling that also makes sure that preemption does not make the active hazardous order count exceed 9 orders.
      - **Leveraging Data/Analysis:** Frequency of hazardous order limits being reached and express order preemption durations.
      - **Expected Outcomes:** Faster express order handling without increasing delays for standard orders or breaching regulatory limits.

**4. Simulation and Validation:**
    - **Simulation Techniques:**
        - Build a simulation model that includes resource contention (e.g., cold-packing stations), batching logic, priority handling, and hazardous material order limits. The model should be validated against historical data.
        
    - **Simulation Focus Points:**
        - Replicate cold-packing station resource contention.
        - Test dynamic resource allocation strategies.
        - Evaluate new batching logic (batch size and time limits).
        - Ensure the 10-order limit for hazardous material orders isn’t exceeded while handling preemptions.

**5. Monitoring Post-Implementation:**
    - **Key Metrics and Dashboards:**
        - Queue lengths and waiting times for cold-packing stations.
        - Batch formation times and batch sizes for "Shipping Label Generation."
        - Preemption events for standard orders due to express orders.
        - Concurrent hazardous orders in "Packing" and "QA."
        - Total order fulfillment time by order type, cold-packing need, and hazardous material status.
    
    - **Tracking Constraint Management:**
        - Decrease in cold-packing station queue lengths.
        - Shorter batch formation times.
        - Minimized preemption durations for standard orders.
        - Compliance with hazardous material order limits.
