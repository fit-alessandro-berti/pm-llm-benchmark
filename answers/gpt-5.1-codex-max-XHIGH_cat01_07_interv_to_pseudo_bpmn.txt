**Artifacts:**  
- Invoice (original/revised)  
- Purchase Order (original or retrospective)  
- Purchasing confirmation email  
- Manager approval request/notification  
- Payment schedule entry

**Notes/Variations:**  
- Manager approval is only requested after confirmation of receipt and successful matching.  
- In rare cases, the Department Manager may flag budget issues or unexpected items and ask AP to hold and investigate.  
- The AP Supervisor ensures exception invoices (missing PO, unresolved discrepancies) are resolved and returned to the normal flow.
