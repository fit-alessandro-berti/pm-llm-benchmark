 The provided data appears to be a log of declarations and related activities within an organization. Here's a simplified description of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The declaration moves through several approval levels, starting with a Pre-Approver (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER). If the Pre-Approver rejects it, the process goes back to Step 1 or Step 2 depending on who submits another request (Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION). If the Pre-Approver approves it, the declaration moves to the next level:
   - Supervisor (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR): If rejected, return to Step 2 or Step 1 depending on who submits another request. If approved, final approval is given (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
   - Administration (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION): If rejected, return to Step 2 or Step 1 depending on who submits another request. If approved, the declaration is saved (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION), and if it was initially submitted by an employee, a payment request might be triggered ('Request Payment').
3. Budget Owner (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by BUDGET OWNER): If rejected, return to Step 2 or Step 1 depending on who submits another request. If approved, the declaration is saved (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER), and if it was initially submitted by an employee, a payment might be handled ('Payment Handled').
4. In some cases, the Budget Owner, Supervisor, or Administration might reject a declaration due to missing information (Declaration REJECTED by MISSING). The declaring party must correct this and resubmit the declaration for approval.

The 'Directly-Follows Constraints' indicate that a declaration can only go from 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' or 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' to 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING', and from 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' to 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'. This suggests that these specific transitions are allowed directly after the mentioned events, without any other intervening steps.
