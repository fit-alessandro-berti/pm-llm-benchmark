The image is an endtoend process diagram (a processmining / workflow map) of an order and procurement pipeline.

- Top level inputs: PurchaseRequisitionItem, SalesOrderItem, and PurchaseOrderItem (with counts like 2.0M, 3.5M, 5.0M objects).
- The flow then splits into several parallel streams:
  - Create Requisition (and its approval) path
  - Create Order (and packing/shipping path)
  - Return/Invoice related paths (vendor invoices, returns, etc.)
- Core process steps appear as rounded boxes, for example:
  - Create Requisition, Approve Requisition
  - Create Order, Pack Goods, Ship Goods, Confirm Delivery, Close Order
  - Create Invoice, Approve Payment
  - Send Order, Check Stock, Process Return, Create Invoice
- Endpoints are shown as End nodes; multiple End nodes indicate different termination points in the process.
- Each box shows an “Overall” object count (e.g., Overall: 3.0M for Create Requisition) and the edges between nodes have time labels (milliseconds) indicating latency or duration between steps.
- Edges are colorcoded, likely representing different roles, teams, or process lanes.
- The diagram provides an overview of throughput (volumes) and timing across the full procuretopay and ordertocash lifecycle.
