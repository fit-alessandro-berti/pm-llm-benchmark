Here’s a Python dictionary representing the **Log Skeleton** for the given order fulfillment process, incorporating the declarative constraints based on the logical flow of activities:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No activities are strictly equivalent in this scenario
    'always_before': {
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment'),
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability')  # RO must happen before CA
    },
    'always_after': set(),  # No strict "always after" constraints beyond directly-follows
    'never_together': set(),  # No activities are mutually exclusive in the same case
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order': {1},  # Must occur exactly once per order
        'Check Availability': {1},
        'Reserve Items': {1},
        'Pick Items': {1},
        'Quality Check': {1},
        'Pack Order': {1},
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},
        'Dispatch': {1},
        'Invoice Customer': {1},
        'Record Payment': {1}  # Payment may not always be recorded immediately (e.g., credit terms)
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Constraints:
1. **Equivalence**: No activities are strictly equivalent (e.g., no two activities must always co-occur with identical counts).
2. **Always Before**:
   - Activities like `Check Availability` must precede `Reserve Items`, `Pick Items` must precede `Quality Check`, etc.
   - `Receive Order` must always happen before `Check Availability`.
3. **Always After**: Not explicitly needed here, as the flow is linear and covered by `directly_follows`.
4. **Never Together**: No activities are mutually exclusive in the same case (e.g., no two activities that cannot coexist).
5. **Activity Occurrences**:
   - Most activities occur exactly once per order (`{1}`).
   - `Record Payment` could technically have `{0,1}` if payment is deferred (e.g., credit terms), but the problem implies it is part of the process.
6. **Directly-Follows Constraints**:
   - The sequence is strictly linear (e.g., `RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP`).

### Adjustments (if needed):
- If `Record Payment` can be skipped (e.g., for credit customers), update `'activ_freq'` to `'Record Payment': {0,1}`.
- If parallel activities exist (e.g., `Invoice Customer` and `Dispatch` could happen in any order), remove the `directly_follows` constraint between them and add `never_together` if they cannot coexist.
