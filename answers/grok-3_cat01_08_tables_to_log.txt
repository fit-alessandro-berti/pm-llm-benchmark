### Event Log for Process Mining

Below is the comprehensive event log created by integrating the provided tables from the ERP system. The event log is structured to support process mining analysis, with each row representing a distinct event in the lifecycle of an order. The log adheres to the requirements specified, including the use of `order_id` as the Case ID, derivation of activities from key process steps, mapping of timestamps, and inclusion of resources and additional attributes where available.

#### Assumptions and Design Decisions
1. **Case ID**: `order_id` is used as the unique identifier for each process instance (case).
2. **Activities**: Activities are derived from the lifecycle of an order as follows:
   - "Order Created" from the `Orders` table (`order_date`).
   - "Item Picked" from the `Order Lines` table, with one event per line item to reflect individual picking actions (`item_picking_date`).
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from the `Delivery` table, with separate events for each delivery if multiple shipments exist (`delivery_dispatch_date` and `delivery_arrival_date`).
   - "Invoice Issued" from the `Invoice` table, with one event per invoice if multiple invoices exist for an order (`invoice_issue_date`).
   - "Payment Received" from the `Payments` table, with one event per payment if multiple payments exist (`payment_date`).
3. **Timestamps**: Events are ordered chronologically based on their respective timestamps. For multiple events of the same type (e.g., multiple "Item Picked" events), each is listed separately to preserve granularity.
4. **Resources**: The `Resource` column is populated using data from the `Resources` table, linked via IDs in the respective tables (e.g., `sales_person_id`, `picker_id`, `carrier_id`, `billing_person_id`). If no direct resource is associated with an event (e.g., "Payment Received"), the field is left as "N/A".
5. **Additional Attributes**: Relevant attributes such as `customer_type`, `order_priority`, `item_id`, `quantity`, `delivery_note`, `invoice_amount`, and `payment_method` are included to enrich the log.
6. **Missing Data**: For `order_id` 1004, there is no delivery or invoice data. It is assumed that the process is incomplete for this order, and only available events are included. If further data becomes available, it can be appended.

#### Notes on the Event Log
- **Chronological Order**: Events are listed in ascending order of timestamp within each case to reflect the real process flow.
- **Granularity**: Individual "Item Picked" events are retained to capture the detailed actions in the warehouse, which may be relevant for process mining (e.g., identifying bottlenecks in picking).
- **Resource Mapping**: Resources are mapped to their respective names using the `Resources` table, enhancing traceability of who performed specific actions.
- **Incomplete Cases**: For `order_id` 1004, only "Order Created" and "Item Picked" events are included due to the absence of delivery, invoice, and payment data. This reflects the current state of the process for this order.
- **Additional Attributes**: These provide context for analysis, such as identifying high-priority orders or specific delivery conditions.

This event log is now ready for process mining analysis, enabling the discovery of process models, identification of bottlenecks, and compliance checks. If further data or refinements are needed, the structure can be extended accordingly.
