### Identification of Violating Cases

After carefully reviewing the event log against the normative process description, the following cases have been identified as violating the intended process flow:

1. **Case 2**: This case violates the normative process by packaging items before authorizing payment. According to the description, payment authorization should occur before packaging items to ensure that the customer's payment method is valid and approved before preparing the items for shipment.

2. **Case 3**: This case violates the normative process in two significant ways. First, it attempts to ship an order after it has been canceled, which directly contradicts the principle that shipping should never occur after a cancellation. Second, the cancellation of the order happens after payment authorization, which does not align with the described process for handling insufficient inventory, where cancellation should occur immediately after checking inventory if it's insufficient.

3. **Case 5**: This case bypasses the "Package items" step altogether, proceeding directly from authorizing payment to shipping the order. The normative process clearly states that items should be prepared for shipment (packaged) after payment authorization and before the order is shipped.

### Explanation of Violations

These violations can be understood by referencing the key constraints outlined in the normative process description:

- **Sequence of Activities**: The normative process emphasizes a specific sequence of activities under different conditions (sufficient vs. insufficient inventory). Violations occur when this sequence is not followed, such as in Case 2 where the sequence of payment authorization and packaging is reversed.

- **Conditionality of Actions**: Certain actions are conditional upon the outcome of previous steps. For instance, shipping should only occur if the order has not been canceled, and packaging should only happen after payment authorization. Case 3 violates this by attempting to ship after cancellation, and Case 5 violates by shipping without first packaging the items.

- **Logical Consistency**: The process description implies a logical consistency in handling orders, particularly in how inventory sufficiency affects the flow. Case 3's attempt to ship after cancellation contradicts this logical flow, indicating a deviation from the intended process.

In interpreting any ambiguities, it's essential to adhere to the primary principles of sequence, conditionality, and logical consistency as outlined in the normative process description. The identified cases demonstrate clear deviations from these principles, highlighting areas where the actual process execution did not align with the intended normative process.
