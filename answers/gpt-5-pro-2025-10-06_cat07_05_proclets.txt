It’s a three-part figure that models a small healthcare workflow using interacting processes (proclets).

a) Interaction/process view: Two proclet classes—Lab visit (left) and Lab test (right)—each start at a black dot and end at a black bullseye. Tasks are shown as rectangles with the performer icons (doctor, lab assistant, chemical analyst). Lab visit includes Order entry, Take blood sample, Receive result, Judge results, optional Do tests again, Receive updated result, and Send report. Lab test includes Perform test, Make report, Finish lab test, optional Perform test again, and Provide updated report. The two proclets communicate via two channels:
- Order system (top dashed box): used to create a Lab test instance from the visit.
- HIS (middle dashed box): used to send the report back, request a re-test, and return updated results.
Numbered links (1.0, 1.1, …) mark the individual message exchanges.

b) Class diagram: Lab visit requires Lab test with cardinality 1..1 (visit) to 1..* (tests), i.e., one visit may require one or more tests.

c) Example performative (message): At 11:00, over channel Order system, sender “Lab visit – John” sends a Create message to “Lab test – HGB John” with content “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”, scope Private, direction OUT.
