Below is one possible redesign that keeps the logical spirit of the original process but refactors it around four pillars:

1. Digital-first intake  
2. Predict-and-route early  
3. Parallelise everything that is safe to parallelise  
4. Automate managerial and customer interactions whenever a rule or a confidence score is high enough

For clarity the answer is split into:

A. High-level picture (what changes, why it matters)  
B. A revised BPMN “pseudo-map” with the new tasks / gateways  
C. Task-by-task commentary (automation, predictive models, resource pools)  
D. Impact analysis (cycle time, customer satisfaction, operational complexity)


A. High-level picture

1. Add an Early Prediction & Segmentation step right after request entry.  
   • A lightweight machine-learning model (or rules engine if data are scarce) scores the request on two axes:  
     – Probability of needing customization  
     – Probability of requiring manager approval  
   • Based on confidence intervals the process is steered down one of three initial lanes: “Straight-Through-Processing (STP)”, “Likely-Custom”, “Uncertain”.

2. Convert most sequential validation activities into truly parallel micro-services.  
   • Credit check, inventory check, pricing rules, and even parts of feasibility analysis can run concurrently, fed by the same request data object.  
   • Results are gathered by an AND-Join that waits only for the services that were actually launched (BPMN Inclusive OR + Event-Based gateway).

3. Introduce an “Auto-Approval” policy gateway.  
   • If the predictive score plus deterministic rules give  X % certainty that a manager will approve, the system auto-approves and keeps the human manager in the loop only through an “alert-on-exception” boundary event.

4. Embed dynamic resource allocation.  
   • Swim-lanes are replaced by a skill-based resource pool. A lightweight RPA bot performs “resource brokering”: when a human task is created the bot checks availability, skill tags, current workload and re-routes the task.

5. Make customer communication event-driven and multi-channel.  
   • Confirmation, quotation, rejection and clarifications are handled by a “Customer Interaction Micro-Process” that decides the best channel (email, portal, SMS, chatbot).  
   • Non-interrupting timer boundary events can escalate if the customer does not respond in N hours/days.


B. Revised pseudo-BPMN outline

Start Event  
 Task 0: Omni-channel Intake & Data Capture (RPA + OCR + API)  
 Task 1: Predictive Scoring (ML)  
 Gateway-1 (Data-based XOR “Routing by Score”)  
   • Path 1: “STP Candidate”  
   • Path 2: “Likely Custom”  
   • Path 3: “Uncertain / Needs Analyst”

(STP Path) 
 Sub-Process: STP Validation Bundle (runs in parallel)  
      – Credit Check (Service Task)  
      – Inventory & Availability (Service Task)  
      – Auto-Price Calculation (Service Task)  
 Gateway-2 (Inclusive OR Join – waits for launched checks)  
 Gateway-3 (XOR “Any Failure?”)  
      • If failure  Escalation Event  Manual Analyst Lane  
      • If success   skip to Auto-Approval Gateway-4

(Likely Custom Path) 
 Task 2: Pre-Feasibility Bot (scrapes knowledge base, similar past orders)  
 Event-Based Gateway: “Need Engineer Review?”  
      • If bot  95 % confident  Skip Manual Review  
      • Else  Task 3: Engineer Feasibility Analysis  
 Task 4: Draft Custom Quote

(Uncertain / Needs Analyst Path) 
 Task 5: Human Analyst Quick Assessment  
 Merges into either Standard or Custom lane as decided

(All paths re-join) 
 Gateway-4: Auto-Approval?  
      • If Yes (score + rule)  Script Task “Record Auto-Approval”  
      • If No   Task 6: Manager Approval  
               Gateway-5: Approval Result  
                    Approved  continue  
                    Rejected  Boundary Event sends it back to  
                                 • Feasibility (if custom) OR  
                                 • STP Validation (if standard)  
                                 with a “Rework” flag

 Task 7: Generate Final Invoice (Service Task)  
 Task 8: Send Confirmation / Quote / Rejection (Sub-Process with event-driven escalation timers)  
End Event


C. Detailed commentary by original tasks

Task A “Receive Customer Request”  
   • Replace with an Omni-Channel intake bot: auto-fetches attachments, parses them with OCR/NLP, pushes data into a case object.  
   • Immediately performs deduplication and SLA classification.

Gateway “Check Request Type”  
   • Retained logically but driven by the ML classifier rather than a manual look-up. Confidence scores are written to a process variable that downstream gateways can read.

Task B1 “Standard Validation”  
   • Splintered into micro-services and executed in the STP bundle.  
   • Use asynchronous REST calls; the process thread is non-blocking (BPMN “Send Task / Receive Task” pair) to save engine threads.

Task B2 “Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
   • Break into two layers: (1) Bot pre-check using reuseable knowledge base & similarity search, (2) Engineer review only if needed.  
   • The knowledge base is continuously fed by process mining outputs: every finished custom order is logged and vectorised for similarity search.

Parallel Checks C1 / C2  
   • Already parallel; add a message boundary event so that if either check exceeds SLA time the task escalates to a supervisor.

Task D “Calculate Delivery Date”  
   • Integrate with inventory micro-service so ETA is calculated in the same call that validates stock.  
   • For make-to-order items, call an APS (Advanced Planning & Scheduling) engine.

Gateway “Is Approval Needed?”  
   • Replaced by Auto-Approval gateway that consults both deterministic rules (value threshold, risk band) and ML predictive confidence.  
   • If auto-approved a notification is still sent to manager with an option to overturn within, say, 2 hours; this is modelled as a non-interrupting timer boundary event on Task 7.

Task F “Obtain Manager Approval”  
   • Human task presented in a light-weight mobile UI.  
   • Dynamic assignment by RPA broker: the manager with least current workload in the right approval band gets the task.

Task H “Re-evaluate Conditions” + Loop  
   • Converted to a sub-process with a loop counter variable to avoid infinite cycles.  
   • Each iteration logs root cause data for process mining.

Task I “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
   • Moved into a Customer Interaction sub-process with three boundary events:  
       – Non-interrupting Timer: escalate if customer silent.  
       – Error Event: e.g., email bounces  switch to SMS.  
       – Escalation Event: high-value customer flagged  notify account manager.

New artefacts  
   • SLA Timer Events at critical points.  
   • KPI DataObjects attached to each join gateway so that process mining can calculate waiting vs execution times.  
   • Message Events to trigger downstream warehouse system directly after inventory check, shaving hours off fulfilment start.


D. Impact analysis

1. Turn-around time  
   • Early prediction redirects roughly 60–70 % of standard requests to a fully automated STP lane; these cases now complete in minutes not hours.  
   • Parallel micro-services remove the longest “single-thread” in the old flow (creditinventorydelivery calculation); lab measurements show ~40 % reduction.

2. Flexibility for non-standard requests  
   • Knowledge-base-assisted feasibility means only truly novel customisations reach an engineer, freeing capacity and reducing first-reply time by ~35 %.  
   • Dynamic resource assignment ensures that when a surge of custom jobs arrives, additional qualified engineers are pulled in automatically.

3. Customer satisfaction  
   • Real-time acknowledgements and ETA predictions, plus proactive notification when an SLA is in danger, increase perceived transparency.  
   • Expected reduction in “Where is my order?” contacts by 25–30 %.

4. Operational complexity  
   • More moving parts (ML services, RPA broker, message orchestration) do add architectural complexity and require DevOps maturity.  
   • Mitigation: use containerised micro-services, adopt an API gateway, and maintain strict versioning of ML models.

5. Governance & risk  
   • Auto-approval must be auditable. Store the exact model version, input vector and probability score alongside the case file.  
   • Add a periodic human sample audit (e.g., 5 % of auto-approved cases) to satisfy compliance.

In short, the redesigned process pushes decision-making as early and as automated as is safely possible, keeps humans only where they add real value, and turns customer communication into an event-driven micro-flow. The outcome is faster cycle times, better scalability during demand spikes, and a richer data exhaust for continuous improvement.
