The visualization is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram illustrating a multi-department business process involving Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

**Pools/Lanes and Roles:**
- The process has four distinct pools representing departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

**Sales Department:**
- Begins on Monday morning by checking the order for completeness.
- Then verifies if the customer is already in the database.
  - If not in the database, the process adds the customer to the database.
  - If the customer is already in the database, it proceeds.
- Sends order details to other departments.
- After sending order details, it drafts the invoice upon successful product dispatch.

**Production Department:**
- Starts when order details arrive.
- Plans production and then manufactures the product.
- There is a verification step for material fault.
  - If the material is faulty, the process involves the Procurement department.
  - If the material is not faulty, the manufacturing continues.
- Once the product is complete, the status is updated and the product is sent to the Warehouse.

**Procurement Department:**
- Starts when order details arrive.
- Involves a subprocess called "Material Compensation Subprocess," which includes ordering materials and potentially returning materials.
- Conducts a material check.
- If materials fail the check, it leads to order cancellation.
- If materials pass, it signals the production process.

**Warehouse Department:**
- Starts when the product is complete.
- Sends the product.
- Confirms sending by marking the product as sent.

**Communication and Flow:**
- Dashed lines indicate messages or signals between departments.
- For example, order details flow from Sales to Production and Procurement.
- Product completion signals flow from Production to Warehouse.
- Product sent signal flows back to Sales for invoice drafting.

Overall, the diagram shows a detailed, interconnected workflow covering customer order processing, production planning and manufacturing, material procurement, product sending, and invoicing across multiple business units.
