###  Rationale for New Constraints:

1. **`BiasMitigationCheck` must exist in every trace**:
   - Ensures that sensitive evaluations (like race, gender, or age) are always followed by an additional verification before making decisions.
   - This is added under the `existence` and `response` constraints.

2. **Coexistence of Decision and Manual Review for Minority Applicants**:
   - If an applicant identified as "Minority" is either approved or rejected, a `ManualReview` must also be present.
   - Prevents fully automated decisions without human oversight for sensitive demographic groups.

3. **Prevent direct path from sensitive attribute checks to rejection**:
   - Using `nonsuccession` constraints between `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge` and `Reject`.
   - Addresses implicit biases that may manifest as rejections immediately after checking sensitive data.

4. **Ensure BiasMitigationCheck precedes FinalDecision**:
   - Strengthens the guarantee that assessment fairness is actively verified before any conclusive outcome.

These added constraints provide stronger guarantees for fairness in the loan application process by enforcing audit trails (`ManualReview`), required fairness checks before decision points, and preventing shortcut pathways from sensitive attributes to biased outcomes.
