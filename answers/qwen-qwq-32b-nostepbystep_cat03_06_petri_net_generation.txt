Okay, I need to model this insurance claim management process as an accepting Petri net. Let's start by understanding the process flow described. 

The process starts with the customer filing an Insurance Claim (C). The initial marking should have a token at the start place, which I'll probably call "start" or "C". The steps after C are sequential until there are some loops. 

First, the steps are:

C  CR  DV  [if incomplete, go to RDS then back to DV]  FC  [if fraud suspected, go to II and loop back to FC]  CA  AP (only if over threshold?)  P  N  CL.

Wait, the problem states that the Approval (AP) step is only needed if the compensation amount surpasses a certain threshold. Hmm, how do I model that? That's a condition, so maybe AP is an optional transition that can be taken based on some condition. But in Petri nets, transitions are unconditional. So maybe AP is a transition that can be bypassed? Wait, no. Since the threshold is a condition, perhaps the process requires that if the amount is over the threshold, then AP must be done, otherwise it's skipped. But in a Petri net, transitions can't be conditional. So I need to model this as a choice.

Wait, perhaps AP is a transition that is only enabled when the amount is over the threshold. To model this in a Petri net, maybe there's a place before AP that can only be reached when the amount is over, but how do I represent that? Since Petri nets are based on tokens, perhaps there's a split after CA where one path goes to AP (if the amount is high) and another path skips it. But how do I represent the condition? Maybe we need to have a place after CA that has two outgoing transitions: one leading directly to P (if AP isn't needed) and another going through AP. But the user can't choose; it's determined by the amount. Since Petri nets don't handle conditions, maybe the process must allow both paths, but in reality the transition AP is only fired when necessary. Hmm, this is tricky. 

Wait, the problem statement says "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So if the amount is under the threshold, AP isn't required. Therefore, the path would have a choice between going through AP or not. Since Petri nets can't have conditional transitions, perhaps the process must have both paths. So the user (token flow) can choose either path. Wait, but in reality, the choice isn't arbitrary. The problem says that the step is conditional, so perhaps the model must allow both possibilities. Maybe the Petri net is designed such that when the process reaches the CA step, there are two possible paths: one leading to AP then P, and another leading directly to P. So the transition AP is optional, but only when the threshold is crossed. Since Petri nets can't model this condition, perhaps the model must have the AP transition as an optional step that can be taken or not, depending on the path. But how to ensure that it's taken only when needed? Maybe the problem expects to model it as an optional step where the place after CA has two outgoing transitions: one that requires going through AP and another that skips it. 

Alternatively, the problem might just require that AP is part of the process but can be bypassed. Let me think the user is expected to model it as a choice here. So after CA, there's a split where the token can go through AP or not. 

Now, the main challenge is the loops. The Re-Document Submission (RDS) comes after DV if documents are incomplete. So after DV, if there's an issue, the process goes back to RDS (which I assume is a step where the customer resubmits documents), then back to DV again. So this is a loop between DV and RDS. Similarly, after FC, if fraud is suspected, an In-depth Investigation (II) is done, then back to FC again. So that's another loop between FC and II.

Let me outline the steps with the loops:

Start  C  CR  DV  check if incomplete? If yes  RDS  back to DV. 

Wait, but in Petri net terms, this needs to be modeled as a loop. So the place after DV will have an outgoing arc to RDS, then RDS leads back to DV? Or maybe after DV, there's a decision point. Hmm.

Alternatively, after DV, there's a transition to RDS, which then leads back to DV? So the loop is between DV and RDS. Let me think of the places and transitions:

The steps up to DV:

CR is followed by DV. After DV, if documents are incomplete, RDS is triggered, then back to DV again. So the transitions would be:

DV  RDS, and RDS  DV? But that would create a cycle. Wait, but in Petri net terms, the places and transitions need to be arranged so that the loop can happen multiple times. 

Alternatively, the transitions form a loop. Let's think in terms of places and transitions.

Suppose after the DV transition, there is a place. From that place, two transitions: one leading to RDS (if needed) and another proceeding forward (if not). But then how to model the loop?

Alternatively, the loop can be modeled with a transition that loops back. Let's try to structure this step by step.

First, the initial steps: C (start) is the initial transition. Wait, but in Petri nets, transitions are the activities. The places are the states between them. The initial marking has a token at the start place. 

Let me start by listing all the transitions (activities) in order, then consider the loops and conditions.

Transitions (activities):

C (the initial step?), but the first activity is CR (Claim Registration). Wait, the problem says the customer files the Insurance Claim (C), then the steps are 1. Claim Registration (CR). So the first transition after the start is CR. Wait, the problem's first step after C is CR. Wait, the steps are listed as:

1. Claim Registration (CR)

Wait the problem's steps:

The steps after the customer files the claim (C) are:

1. CR (Claim Registration)

Wait, but the problem says the customer files an Insurance Claim (C). Then steps 1 to 8 follow. Wait, the first step after the customer's action is CR. So the initial marking is a token at the start place (place before C?), but maybe the process starts with the C being filed, so C is the first activity. Wait, but the customer's action is C, and then the company's steps start with CR. Maybe the C is part of the process as the start, so the first transition is CR.

Wait, perhaps the process starts with the Claim being filed (C is an event but maybe the first transition is CR. The problem says "the following steps take place" after the customer files C. So the first step is CR. The initial marking should have a token at the start place, which is the input to the first transition (CR). So the first transition is CR. 

So the transitions are:

CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL. 

Now the loops:

- After DV, if documents are incomplete, then RDS (Re-Document Submission) occurs, then back to DV again. So the loop between DV and RDS.

Similarly, after FC, if there are doubts, then II (In-depth Investigation) is done, then back to FC again. So the loop between FC and II.

So the loops need to form loops in the Petri net. 

Let me try to outline the flow step by step, considering the loops:

Start  C (maybe C is the first transition?), but actually, the first step after the claim is filed is CR. Wait, the first activity is CR (step 1). So the process steps are CR, then DV, then check if documents are incomplete: if yes, go to RDS, then back to DV again. So this forms a loop between DV and RDS.

Similarly, after FC, if there's a fraud suspicion, go to II, then back to FC again, so a loop between FC and II.

So the loops are between DV and RDS, and between FC and II. 

Let me think of the places and transitions step by step.

Start Place (initial marking): let's call it P0. The first transition is CR (transition name CR, label "CR"). 

The flow would be something like:

P0 (start)  CR  then to DV's input place, then DV, then after DV, decide whether to go to RDS or proceed. 

Wait, but in Petri nets, the structure must be such that after DV, there's a place where the token can choose between going to RDS or proceeding. But how to model the loop where after RDS, it goes back to DV again. 

Hmm, for the RDS loop:

The process after DV:

After DV, there's a check. If documents are incomplete, the process goes to RDS, then back to DV again. So the loop is between DV and RDS. 

To model this, perhaps the DV transition leads to a place that has an outgoing transition to RDS, and another to the next transition (FC). But the RDS transition then loops back to the place before DV, allowing DV to fire again.

Wait, here's an approach for the DV loop:

After the DV transition, the token goes to a place (let's say P_DV). From P_DV, there are two options: either proceed to FC (if documents are okay), or go to RDS (if not). But RDS's output then loops back to the place before DV so that DV can be triggered again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Place1 (after CR)  DV  Place2  split into two paths: one to RDS and another to the next step (FC). But after RDS, it goes back to the place before DV?

Alternatively, the loop can be modeled with a place between DV and RDS:

Let me try to model the DV loop first:

- The transitions are DV, RDS.

The loop structure would look like:

- After DV, the token goes to a place. From there, if RDS is needed, the token goes to RDS, then after RDS transitions back to the place before DV. Wait, perhaps:

DV transitions to a place (DV_out). From DV_out, there's an arc to RDS (if needed). RDS transitions to a place (RDS_out which then loops back to the place before DV (the place that feeds into DV). 

Wait, maybe like this:

DV's output place has an arc to RDS transition. The RDS transition leads back to the input place of DV, so that after RDS, the token is back at the input of DV, allowing it to fire again.

Wait, perhaps:

The sequence is:

CR  DV  [if documents incomplete  RDS  then back to recheck DV]

So the transitions:

Place A  DV  Place B. From Place B, there are two transitions: RDS and FC.

Wait no, that's not right. Let me try to structure this.

Let me try to diagram the DV loop:

Start with the places:

Place1 is the start (initial marking).

After CR (transition), we have Place2.

Place2  DV  Place3.

At Place3, the choice: if documents are incomplete, then go to RDS. The RDS transition takes the token from Place3, then after RDS, it loops back to Place2? Wait, but then DV can be fired again.

Wait, perhaps:

Place3 is the place after DV. From Place3, there are two transitions:

1. RDS, which leads to Place4, then back to Place2 (the input of DV?), so that after RDS, the token is back at Place2, allowing DV to fire again.

Wait, perhaps:

Place2 (after CR)  DV  Place3 (after DV). From Place3, the RDS transition can be taken, leading to Place4, then a transition to Place2 again. 

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to formalize this:

Let me define the transitions and places step by step.

Start Place (P0) has a token initially. The first transition is CR (Claim Registration).

So:

P0 is the initial marking, so im = {P0:1}.

CR transitions from P0, leading to Place1.

After CR, the next transition is DV, so Place1  DV  Place2.

After DV, we have a place (Place2). At this point, if documents are incomplete, the process goes to RDS, then back to DV again. So to model this, the Place2 has an outgoing transition to RDS. RDS would have an output that loops back to Place1 (the input of DV's transition. Wait:

Wait, the RDS transition would need to loop back to the input of DV, so that after RDS, the process can again check DV again. So the RDS transition's outgoing place would be connected to DV's input place again.

Wait, perhaps:

Place2 (after DV) has two transitions: RDS and FC (next step if documents are okay). 

Wait, the FC is the next step after documents are verified. So the FC comes after the DV is okay. 

So, after DV, the process can either proceed to FC (if documents are okay) or go to RDS (if not). 

The RDS transition must then loop back to the input of DV so that DV can be performed again. 

Wait, the RDS transition's output place would need to feed back into the input of DV. 

So the structure would be:

After DV (Place2):

- If documents are incomplete (triggering RDS):

Place2 has an outgoing transition RDS. RDS's output place (PlaceRDS) leads back to the input of DV (Place1). Thus, after RDS, the token is at Place1, allowing DV to be fired again. 

Wait, but the transitions must be connected with places. Let me try step by step:

Let me try to detail each step with places and transitions:

Let me list all places and transitions:

Transitions:

CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Wait, the steps are:

The activities are:

CR  DV  (if incomplete, RDS  DV again)  FC  (if fraud suspected, II  FC again)  CA  (AP if over threshold)  P  N  CL.

So the loops are on DV and FC.

First, the RDS loop:

The DV transition is followed by a place (DV_out), then from there, the RDS transition can be taken, which loops back to the input of DV. 

Wait, perhaps the structure for the RDS loop is:

CR  DV  [DV_out]. From DV_out, two options: 

- If OK, proceed to FC.

- If not, go to RDS, which loops back to the input of DV (so that DV can be done again.

Wait, perhaps the RDS transition's output leads back to the input of DV. 

Let me try to model the DV loop:

Start with Place0 (initial place, which is the initial marking).

Transition CR is fired from Place0, leading to Place1.

Place1  DV  Place2 (DV's output place).

From Place2, there are two transitions: RDS and FC.

Wait, but FC is the next step after documents are okay. So the flow after DV is either to RDS or to FC. 

Wait, so Place2 has to have an outgoing transition to RDS and another to FC. 

Wait, but if the process has to go through RDS then back to DV, the RDS transition must loop back to the input of DV. Let me outline the RDS loop:

Place2 (after DV) has an outgoing transition RDS. The RDS transition would have an output place (Place_RDS) which then connects back to the input of DV. 

Wait, perhaps after RDS, the output place is connected to the input of DV again, so that DV can be fired again.

Wait, here's a possible structure for the DV loop:

- After DV (Place2), the RDS transition is present. 

RDS's output leads to a place (Place_RDS_out), which then has an arc to DV? No, transitions must be connected via places. 

Alternatively:

DV  Place2  RDS  Place_RDS  then a transition that leads back to the input of DV. 

Wait, perhaps:

Place2 (after DV) has two transitions: RDS and FC.

If RDS is taken, then RDS transitions to Place3, then from there, a transition that loops back to the place before DV (Place1). 

Wait, the transition RDS would have its output place connected to a transition that loops back. 

Alternatively, after RDS, there's a transition that goes back to the input of DV. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition's output place connects to a transition that takes us back to the start of the loop.

This is getting a bit complex, but let me try to structure this.

Let me try to model the DV loop:

The transitions involved in the loop are DV and RDS.

The places involved would be:

Place0 (before CR), Place1 (after CR), Place2 (after DV), Place3 (after RDS).

Wait, perhaps:

- The CR transition is from P0 to P1.

- The DV transition is from P1 to P2.

Wait, maybe:

Let me try to map out all the places and transitions step by step.

Let me start building the Petri net step by step.

First, the start:

net = PetriNet()

Create the initial place P0. The initial marking (im) has a token at P0.

The initial marking im is {P0:1}.

The first transition is CR (Claim Registration). The transition CR fires when there's a token in P0. 

After CR is fired, the output token goes to the next place, say P1.

So, place P0 is connected to CR (input), and after firing, the token goes to place P1.

Then, the next transition is DV (Document Verification). So P1  DV  P2.

From P2, after DV, the process can:

- If documents are incomplete, go to RDS, then back to the input of DV (Place1?), so that DV can be re-run? 

Wait, but the RDS is a step before DV again. So after RDS, we need to go back to the place before DV, so DV can be triggered again.

Let me think of the RDS loop as a loop between DV and RDS.

The flow after DV (P2):

Place2 (after DV) can have transitions:

- If documents are incomplete, go to RDS (transition RDS), then after RDS, the process loops back to the place before DV (Place1?), so that DV can be re-run.

Wait, perhaps:

P2 has an outgoing transition for RDS. The RDS transition leads to a place P3. From P3, there's a transition that loops back to Place1 (the input of DV). 

Wait, but transitions can't loop directly. So the RDS transition's output is a place P_RDS. From P_RDS, there's a transition that loops back to the input of DV (Place1?), so that DV can be fired again.

Alternatively, after RDS, the token goes to a place that allows the process to loop back.

Alternatively, after RDS, the next transition is a transition that loops back to the input of DV. Let me see:

Perhaps the RDS transition leads to a place P_RDS, and from there a transition (maybe an invisible transition?) that sends the token back to the input of DV. Wait, but perhaps the structure would be:

After RDS, the token goes to a place that feeds into DV again.

Alternatively, the RDS transition's output place connects back to the input of DV. 

Wait, perhaps:

- After DV (place P2):

If RDS is needed, the token goes to RDS, then after RDS, it goes back to the place before DV (Place1) so that DV can be fired again. 

So the RDS transition is connected so that after RDS, the token goes to Place1 again. 

Wait, here's the structure:

- After DV (transition DV), which is after CR (which was after C, but actually, the initial transition is CR. Wait, need to clarify the exact sequence.

Let me try to outline the entire structure step by step, considering all transitions and their connections.

Let me first list all transitions:

Transitions are:

CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP (only if needed), P, N, CL.

Wait, the process steps:

Starting from initial marking:

Place0 (im has a token here).

Transition CR (Claim Registration) is fired, leading to Place1.

Place1  DV (Document Verification)  Place2 (after DV).

At Place2, the next steps depend on the documents. If documents are incomplete, the RDS transition is taken. So:

Place2 has two transitions: RDS and FC.

If RDS is taken:

Place2  RDS  Place3  then back to the input of DV (Place1?), so that we can redo DV again.

Wait, after RDS, the process needs to go back to the point where we can re-run DV. 

The RDS transition's output place connects to Place1, so that after RDS, the token is back to Place1, allowing DV to be triggered again.

Wait, here's the structure for the RDS loop:

Transition DV's output is Place2.

Place2 has two transitions: RDS and FC.

The RDS transition is triggered when documents are incomplete. After RDS is done, the token is routed back to Place1 (the input of DV). 

Wait, but Place1 is the place after CR, so after RDS, the token would go back to Place1, so that DV can be performed again. 

Wait, but how?

Wait, here's the approach for the RDS loop:

After DV (Place2), the RDS transition is possible. 

RDS's output is a place, say PlaceRDS. From PlaceRDS, there's a transition that loops back to the input of DV. 

Wait, maybe after RDS, the next transition is a transition that takes us back to the input of DV's transition (Place1).

Wait, the transition RDS would have an output place (PlaceRDS), then from PlaceRds, there's a transition that goes to Place1 again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition's output place is connected to a transition that loops back to the input of DV. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition itself loops back. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition's output place connects to a transition that's a transition that allows DV to be fired again.

Alternatively, the RDS transition leads to a place, and then a transition (maybe a silent transition?) that loops back to the place before DV.

Alternatively, the RDS transition leads to a place (PlaceRDS), and from there, there's a transition (maybe an invisible transition?) that leads back to the place before DV (Place1). 

Wait, perhaps:

Place2 (after DV) can have two transitions: RDS and FC. 

- If FC is taken, the process proceeds normally.

- If RDS is taken, then after RDS, the token goes to a place (PlaceRDS), then there's another transition that goes back to Place1 (the place after CR, which is the place before DV. 

Wait, but transitions can't go directly from PlaceRDS to Place1, unless there's a transition between them. 

Hmm, perhaps after RDS:

Transition RDS is fired, leading to a place PlaceRDS. From PlaceRds, there's a transition (maybe an invisible one?) that leads back to Place1. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition's output is connected to a transition that loops back. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition's output is a place, which then has an arc to the input of DV (Place1). 

Wait, let's try to structure it as follows:

- After DV (Place2):

- If RDS is needed, the token goes to RDS, which leads to a place (Place3), then a transition to Place1 (the input of DV). 

Wait, this requires an additional transition between Place3 and Place1?

Hmm, maybe the RDS transition's output place (PlaceRDS) connects to a transition that leads back to Place1.

Alternatively, the RDS transition's output is PlaceRDS, and then from there, the transition FC is not yet taken, but instead, going back to DV.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to model the RDS loop as a loop between DV and RDS.

The loop for RDS would be:

Place after DV (Place2) has an arc to RDS (if needed). 

After RDS (PlaceRDS), then the process loops back to the place before DV (Place1?), so that DV can be fired again.

Thus, after RDS, there should be a transition that leads back to the input of DV (Place1). 

Wait, perhaps the RDS transition leads to a place P_RDS, and from there, there is an arc to the transition DV? No, transitions can't have arcs from places to transitions, only transitions to places. Wait, transitions are connected via arcs from places to transitions, and transitions to places. 

Hmm, maybe:

Place2 (after DV) has transitions:

- RDS (if needed)  PlaceRDS. 

Then, after PlaceRds, there is a transition that loops back to the input of DV, which is Place1. 

Wait, but transitions can't be loops. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition has an arc to a place, and then a transition that goes back to Place1.

Wait, perhaps after RDS, the process has a transition that goes back to the input of DV. 

Alternatively, after RDS, the next transition is a silent transition (a place with a transition that leads back to Place1. Maybe a hidden transition? But we can't have hidden transitions in this case since the user wants all transitions to be the activity names. 

Hmm, perhaps the RDS transition's output place is connected to a transition that goes back to Place1. Let me think in steps:

- The RDS transition is between Place2 and PlaceRDS.

PlaceRDS has an outgoing transition that connects to Place1 (the input place of DV). 

Wait, the transition that loops back would have an input arc from PlaceRDS and an output arc to Place1. But transitions can't have outputs to places except their output.

Wait, transitions must be connected via arcs:

Place2 (after DV) has:

- outgoing arcs to RDS and to FC (the next activity if documents are okay).

Wait, no, FC comes after the documents are okay. 

Wait, the process is:

After DV, if documents are incomplete, then RDS is executed, then the process loops back to DV again. So the RDS transitions leads back to the point before DV, so that DV can be executed again.

Thus, after RDS, the process needs to go back to the state where DV can be done again. 

Let me think of the RDS loop as follows:

Place2 (after DV)  RDS  PlaceRDS  and from PlaceRDS, there is a transition that goes back to the place before DV (Place1, which is after CR). So the RDS transition's output is PlaceRds, which has an outgoing transition that leads back to Place1. 

Wait, but transitions can't be loops between places. Hmm, perhaps the RDS transition's output is a place (PlaceRDS) which connects to a transition that transitions back to Place1. 

Alternatively, after RDS, the process goes to a transition that goes back to the input of DV (Place1). 

Wait, perhaps:

DV's input is Place1, output is Place2.

Place2 has transitions RDS and FC.

The RDS transition's output is PlaceRDS. From PlaceRDS, there's a transition (maybe a hidden transition?) leading back to Place1. 

But since all transitions must be labeled with the activity names (like RDS, FC, etc.), perhaps we need to model the loop with an additional transition that allows the loop.

Alternatively, the RDS loop can be modeled with an arc from PlaceRDS to the transition DV again, but that's not possible since transitions are only between places and transitions.

Hmm, maybe the RDS transition's output is PlaceRDS, and PlaceRDS has an outgoing transition (a transition that takes us back to the place before DV (Place1. 

Wait, the transition that goes back would be an invisible transition? But the problem requires transitions to have labels of the activities. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition leads back to Place1 via its output place.

Wait, perhaps the RDS transition's output is Place1 again. 

Wait, let's try:

The RDS transition is between Place2 and Place1?

Wait, that's not possible because transitions have one input and output place each. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition is between Place2 (DV's output) and PlaceRDS. 

Then, from PlaceRDS, there's a transition that leads back to Place1. Let's call that transition "loop_back_to_DV" but that's not part of the required activities, which is not allowed. 

Hmm, perhaps the RDS is part of the loop, so after RDS, the next transition is another DV. 

Wait, perhaps the RDS's output place is connected back to the input of DV (Place1). 

So, RDS's output place (PlaceRDS) has an outgoing transition that is DV again. 

Wait, but transitions can only be fired once. 

This is getting complicated. Let me think of the loop as a loop between DV and RDS.

The RDS loop:

DV  ...  RDS  back to before DV again.

In Petri net terms, loops can be modeled with a place between the two transitions.

Alternatively, the RDS loop can be modeled with a place and transitions that form a loop:

DV  Place2  RDS  PlaceRDS  back to Place1 (input of DV). 

Wait, perhaps:

- After DV (Place2), the RDS transition is fired, leading to PlaceRDS.

- PlaceRDS has an outgoing transition that goes back to Place1 (the input of DV), so that DV can be triggered again.

This way, after RDS, the token goes to PlaceRDS, which has an outgoing transition that leads back to the input of DV (Place1), allowing DV to fire again.

Thus, the RDS loop would be:

Place2 (after DV) can have two outgoing transitions: RDS and FC.

If RDS is taken, then it goes through RDS, leading to PlaceRDS. From PlaceRDS, there is a transition that goes back to Place1 (input of DV), allowing DV to be done again.

Wait, but how to get back to Place1? The transition leading back to Place1 would require a transition that has PlaceRDS as input and Place1 as output?

But transitions can't have multiple outputs. Wait, no: each transition has one input and one output. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition's output is PlaceRDS. Then, PlaceRDS has an outgoing transition that is DV again? No, that's not allowed. 

Alternatively, after RDS, the process goes to a new transition that leads back to Place1.

Wait, perhaps:

Place2 (after DV)  RDS  PlaceRDS  Transition_back (named something, but perhaps part of the RDS loop. 

Wait, but maybe the loop is structured as a loop between DV and RDS:

PlaceDV_input (Place1)  DV  Place2 (DV's output). 

Place2 has an output to RDS, which takes the token to PlaceRDS. 

PlaceRDS has an output back to Place1, which allows DV to fire again. 

Wait, that can't happen because transitions must have a single input and output. 

Alternatively, after RDS, the token goes to a place that feeds back into Place1.

Wait, let's try to code this as:

After DV (Place2), the RDS transition leads to PlaceRDS. Then PlaceRDS has a transition that leads back to Place1. 

Thus, the RDS loop would be:

Place2  RDS  PlaceRDS  [loop transition?]  Place1. 

Wait, but the loop transition would need to be an invisible transition? The problem requires all transitions to be labeled with their activity names. So maybe this isn't allowed. 

Hmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe the RDS loop can be formed by having the RDS transition loop back via a place to the input of DV.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition's output is connected to a transition that loops back.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition's output place connects to a transition (DV again). 

Wait, perhaps the RDS transition's output is a place that connects to the input of DV. 

Wait, here's an alternative approach for the RDS loop:

- Place2 (after DV) has an outgoing transition RDS.

- RDS takes the token from Place2 and leads to PlaceRDS.

- PlaceRDS has an outgoing transition to Place1 (the input of DV).

Wait, but transitions can't have multiple outputs. 

Alternatively, the PlaceRDS must have an outgoing transition that goes back to Place1, which is the input to DV. 

But that requires a transition that is triggered by PlaceRDS, which would be a transition that loops back. Let me think of the transitions and places:

Place2 (output of DV):

- If RDS is taken:

Place2  RDS  PlaceRDS.

From PlaceRds, the next transition is a transition that leads to Place1 (the input to DV). 

Wait, so PlaceRds must have an outgoing transition to Place1. 

Wait, no, transitions connect to places. Hmm, perhaps:

PlaceRds has an outgoing transition that is the DV transition again? But that would require that PlaceRDS has an arc to DV. 

Alternatively, after RDS, the process goes to a transition that loops back. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to model it step by step with code.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS loop can be modeled with a place between DV and RDS. 

Let me try to code this in code terms, perhaps that will clear things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS loop forms a cycle between DV and RDS. 

Let me consider the RDS loop:

The loop for RDS is:

After DV, if incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV.

So the loop is between DV and RDS.

To model that, the transitions RDS and DV must form a cycle. 

The structure would be:

Place2 (after DV)  RDS (transition)  PlaceRDS  and then a transition that loops back to the input of DV (Place1. 

Wait, this requires a transition from PlaceRDS to Place1. 

Wait, perhaps:

After RDS, the token is in PlaceRds. To go back to DV, PlaceRds must have a transition to the transition DV's input.

Wait, perhaps after RDS, the process goes to a transition that returns the token to the place before DV (Place1). 

Let me try to write this in code terms:

After the DV transition is DV, which has an input Place1 and output Place2.

Place2 has an outgoing transition RDS. 

Transition RDS has input Place2 and output PlaceRDS.

Then, PlaceRDS has an outgoing transition (maybe a "continue" transition?), but that's not an activity. 

Hmm, this is gettingting too tangled. Maybe I should model the RDS loop as a loop between DV and RDS, so that after RDS, you can go back to DV.

Perhaps the transitions DV and RDS form a loop, so that after RDS, the token is back at the place before DV so that DV can be fired again. 

Let me try to think of the RDS loop as a loop between DV and RDS:

- Place1 is the input of DV (after CR).

Place1  DV (transition)  Place2 (after DV).

Place2 has two transitions:

- RDS (if documents incomplete) 

- FC (if documents are okay. 

The RDS transition leads to a place PlaceRDS. 

PlaceRDS has an outgoing transition that goes back to Place1 (the input of DV. 

Wait, but that transition would have to be a new transition. 

Wait, maybe the RDS transition leads to a place that then leads to another transition that loops back to Place1. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition's output place connects to a transition that loops back. 

Alternatively, the RDS transition leads to a place that has an arc to the transition DV again. 

Alternatively, maybe the RDS transition's output is Place1 again, but that's not possible because transitions have one input and output.

Alternatively, after RDS, the process returns to Place1 (the input of DV. So the RDS transition's output is Place1, which allows DV to be fired again. 

Wait, that would work. 

Wait:

DV is fired from Place1 (input) to Place2 (output).

RDS is a transition that can be fired from Place2, leading to PlaceRDS, which then has a transition that goes back to Place1. 

Wait, but that requires an extra transition. Maybe the RDS's output place (PlaceRDS) has an outgoing transition (a new place and transitions?) that loops back.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS transition's output place is connected to a transition that loops back to the input of DV.

Wait, perhaps the RDS transition's output place is Place1 again. 

Wait, that's not possible unless the RDS transition has Place2 as input and Place1 as output. 

Wait, if that's the case:

- Place2 has transitions RDS and FC.
