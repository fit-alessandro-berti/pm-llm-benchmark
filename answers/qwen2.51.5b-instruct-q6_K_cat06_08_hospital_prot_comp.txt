To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze their process variants and executions times. The primary focus should be on identifying significant variances in outcomes that differ significantly for one or both groups.

Here are some key observations:

1. **Performance Differences**:
   - **Protected Group**: 
     - Some processes have performance values of 260001.236, 260008.950, etc.
     - Others have lower values like 240008.984 and 160001.670.
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - Some processes show higher performance levels of 320004.432, 319999.055, etc.
     - Others have lower values like 480007.484 and 639982.275.

   Notable instances:
   - **ER**: 
     - Protected: 284/260001.236 vs. Unprotected: 158/0.000
   - **FD**:
     - Protected: 269/260006.914 vs. Unprotected: 156/0.000

2. **Time Differences**:
   - The time differences in discharges between the two groups are significant.
   - Protected group (ER): 
     - 284 days
     - Unprotected group (FD): 158 days
   - Protected group (FD):
     - 269 days
     - Unprotected group (ER): 156 days

3. **Process Variants**:
   - Some protected processes are shorter, while unprotected processes have longer durations.
   - Example: 
     - Protected process involving ER registration to diagnosis to treatment -> discharge: 284 days
     - Protected expert examination for FD process (ER and FD): 179-174 days

### Summary of Identified Differences:

**Time Difference:**
- **Protected Group**: Significantly shorter average time across all processes.
- **Unprotected Group**: Longer overall average time, with some very long durations.

**Performance Variance:**
- Some protected processes show similar performance levels (260001.236 vs 240008.984).
- Unprotected group shows higher performance in several instances but not all.

### Conclusion:
The primary differences observed are the shorter average discharge time and overall longer processing durations for the 'unprotected' group compared to the 'protected' group. The protected group processes tend to complete more quickly with similar performance, whereas the unprotected group takes significantly longer on average due to prolonged registration times (ER) or expert examination delays (FD).
