The main differences between these healthcare visits can be summarized as follows:

1. **Visit Pattern**:
   - **ER visits**: Most frequent, with over 50% of total visits categorized as ER. These may indicate urgent or acute conditions requiring immediate attention.
   - **FD (Primary Care) visits**: Fewer and less frequent at around 39%. Primary care visits often cover preventative care, chronic disease management, and minor ailments.

2. **Diagnostic Steps**:
   - **ER to Diagnosis**: More detailed process where ER patients go through an expert examination, diagnosis, treatment, then successful discharge.
     - E.g., "Expert Examination" + "Diagnosis" + "Treatment".

3. **Thorough Examination**:
   - Thorough examinations often involve more diagnostic stages and may take longer as they can include additional investigations or consultations.
   - Thorough Examinations are followed by diagnosis, treatment, and discharge.

4. **Discharge Behavior**:
   - Most ER and FD visits result in "Discharge" (56%+).
   - Diagnoses often lead to successful treatments, with an average performance rate of 260-480K cases.
   - Thorough Examinations sometimes involve diagnosing then failing or going back for more treatment before discharge.
   
   Specific examples where Discharge is performed frequently:
     - "Discharge" (ER)
     - "Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge"
     - "Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge"

5. **Treatment Dynamics**:
   - Less structured treatment often in ER and FD where the next step is diagnosis or discharge.
   - Thorough Examination involves a sequence of different diagnostic stages followed by treatment, suggesting more comprehensive approaches to disease management.

6. **Careful Diagnosis and Treatment Sequence**:
   - "Expert Examination -> Diagnosis" indicates careful and specialized diagnostics before immediate action like taking medication or surgical intervention.
     - E.g., "Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis"

7. **Repetitive Care Process**:
   - Visits with repeated diagnostic processes (ER, Expert examination) might indicate ongoing care for chronic conditions requiring regular monitoring.

By analyzing these points, key differences emerge in the diagnostic, treatment protocols, and discharge processes utilized by healthcare facilities within this dataset.
