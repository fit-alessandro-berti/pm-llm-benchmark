### Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process Description

To determine which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process, we will analyze each case step by step, comparing the sequence of activities against the expected flow described in the normative process.

---

### **1. Case 1**
**Event Log:**
```
1. Receive order (2023-10-05 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-05 10:00)
3. Authorize payment (2023-10-05 11:00)
4. Package items (2023-10-05 12:00)
5. Ship order (2023-10-05 13:00)
6. Close order (2023-10-05 14:00)
```

**Analysis:**
- The sequence follows the normative process for a scenario with sufficient inventory:
  - **Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order**
- **No violations detected.**

---

### **2. Case 2**
**Event Log:**
```
1. Receive order (2023-10-06 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-06 09:30)
3. Package items (2023-10-06 10:00)
4. Authorize payment (2023-10-06 10:30)
5. Ship order (2023-10-06 11:00)
6. Close order (2023-10-06 11:30)
```

**Analysis:**
- The sequence deviates from the normative process:
  - **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."** According to the normative process, payment should be authorized before items are packaged.
- **Violation:** The sequence violates the principle that "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment."

### **3. Case 3**
**Event Log:**
```
1. Receive order (2023-10-07 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-07 09:20)
3. Authorize payment (2023-10-07 09:40)
4. Cancel order (2023-10-07 10:00)
5. Ship order (2023-10-07 10:30)
6. Close order (2023-10-07 11:00)
```

**Analysis:**
- The sequence follows the normative process for an insufficient inventory scenario up to the "Cancel order" step:
  - **Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Cancel order → Close order**
- However, **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order,"** which is a clear violation. According to the normative process, once an order is canceled, it should not be shipped.
- **Violation:** The sequence violates the principle that "Ship order" should never occur after "Cancel order."

---

### **4. Case 4**
**Event Log:**
```
1. Receive order (2023-10-08 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-08 09:10)
3. Cancel order (2023-10-08 09:20)
4. Close order (2023-10-08 09:50)
```

**Analysis:**
- The sequence follows the normative process for an insufficient inventory scenario:
  - **Receive order → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order**
- **No violations detected.**

---

### **5. Case 5**
**Event Log:**
```
1. Receive order (2023-10-09 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-09 10:00)
3. Authorize payment (2023-10-09 10:30)
4. Ship order (2023-10-09 11:00)
5. Close order (2023-10-09 11:30)
```

**Analysis:**
- The sequence deviates from the normative process:
  - **"Ship order" occurs before "Package items."** According to the normative process, items must be packaged before they are shipped.
- **Violation:** The sequence violates the principle that "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items."

---

### **Summary of Violations**

1. **Case 2:**
   - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
   - **Explanation:** The normative process requires payment authorization before packaging items.

2. **Case 3:**
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
   - **Explanation:** Once an order is canceled, it should not be shipped.

3. **Case 5:**
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs before "Package items."
   - **Explanation:** Items must be packaged before they are shipped.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Cases 2, 3, and 5** violate the normative process.
- **Case 1 and Case 4** adhere to the normative process.

The violations in Cases 2, 3, and 5 highlight the importance of adhering to the correct sequence of activities to ensure the integrity of the order-handling process.
