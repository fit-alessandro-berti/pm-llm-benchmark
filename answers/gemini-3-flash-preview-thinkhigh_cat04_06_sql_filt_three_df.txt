To solve this, we will use **Window Functions** (`LEAD`) to inspect the sequence of events within each case and a **Common Table Expression (CTE)** to identify the specific `case_id`s that meet the exclusion criteria.

Here is the DuckDB SQL query:

```sql
WITH SequenceCheck AS (
    -- Step 1: Use LEAD to look at the next two activities and their timestamps
    -- for every event, partitioned by case_id and ordered by time.
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_act,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_ts
    FROM event_log
),
ExcludedCases AS (
    -- Step 2: Identify case_ids that match the sequence and the 5-day duration rule.
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM SequenceCheck
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_act = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_act = 'Confirm Order'
      -- Step 3: Check if the gap between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' > 5 days
      AND (next_next_ts - next_ts) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
-- Step 4: Return all events for cases that are NOT in the excluded list.
SELECT 
    case_id, 
    activity, 
    timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM ExcludedCases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation:

1.  **`SequenceCheck` CTE**: We use the `LEAD()` window function to peek forward. For every row, we retrieve the activity and timestamp of the next event and the one after that within the same `case_id`. This allows us to evaluate "direct succession."
2.  **`ExcludedCases` CTE**: 
    *   We look for the pattern: current is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next is 'Create Order', and the third is 'Confirm Order'.
    *   We apply the timing filter: `next_next_ts - next_ts` calculates the duration between the second and third activities in the sequence. In DuckDB, subtracting two timestamps returns an interval, which we compare against `INTERVAL '5 days'`.
3.  **Final Selection**: We perform a `NOT IN` filter against the `event_log`. This ensures that if even one instance of the specific sequence exists in a case, the *entire* case (all its events) is removed from the result set.
4.  **Ordering**: The final result is ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain the logical flow of the remaining process instances.
