The diagram presented is a detailed Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) that illustrates the workflow of an order management process across different departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

### Sales Process:
1. **Trigger**: The process starts every Monday morning.
2. **Check Order for Completeness**: The sales department checks if the customer's order is complete.
3. **Check if Customer Exists in Database**:
    - If the customer is not in the database, a new customer record is added.
    - If the customer is already in the database, the process moves forward.
4. **Send Order Details**: Once the customer and order details are verified, the order details are sent.
5. **Draft Invoice**: An invoice is drafted and then sent to the customer.

### Production Process:
1. **Order Details Arrive**: The production department receives the order details.
2. **Plan Production**: The production is planned.
3. **Check Material Availability**:
    - If materials are available, the product is manufactured.
    - If materials are not available and faulty, a procurement subprocess is triggered.
4. **Manufacture Product**: The product is manufactured once materials are confirmed to be available.
5. **Product Complete**: The completion of the product signals the end of the production process.

### Procurement Subprocess (Material Compensation Subprocess):
1. **Trigger**: Initiated if materials are not available during production planning.
2. **Order Materials**: The procurement department orders the necessary materials.
3. **Check Materials**: Upon arrival, the materials are checked.
    - If materials are okay, they are used in production.
    - If materials are faulty, they are returned, and the order might be canceled.

### Warehouse Process:
1. **Product Complete**: The warehouse receives the signal that the product is complete.
2. **Send Product**: The product is sent from the warehouse to the customer.
3. **Product Sent**: This marks the end of the warehouse process.

### Summary:
- **Sales** handles order verification, customer database updates, and invoicing.
- **Production** plans and manufactures the product, ensuring material availability.
- **Procurement** manages the ordering and checking of materials if there are issues in production.
- **Warehouse** dispatches the completed product to the customer.

This BPMN diagram effectively outlines the end-to-end process of handling customer orders, ensuring clarity in the roles and responsibilities of each department.
