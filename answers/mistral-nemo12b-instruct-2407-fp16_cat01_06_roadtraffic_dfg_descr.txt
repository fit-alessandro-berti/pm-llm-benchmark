Based on the provided data, I've outlined a process flow representing the various steps involved in handling fines and appeals within an administrative system. Here's a description of the process:

1. **Create Fine** -> **Appeal to Judge**
   - A fine is created and immediately appealed to a judge (frequency: 4).

2. **Send Appeal to Prefecture** (from multiple sources)
   - Appeals can be sent to the prefecture from various steps in the process, including:
     - After receiving a result appeal from the prefecture (frequency: 15).
     - After inserting a date appeal to the prefecture (frequency: 15, 7, and 2).
     - From payment processing (frequency: 4, 2, and 1).
     - After notifying the result of an appeal to the offender (frequency: 4).
     - After inserting a fine notification (frequency: 4).
     - Directly from other appeals to judge (frequency: 9 and 4).

3. **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture** (to multiple destinations)
   - Results of appeals can be received back from the prefecture and sent to various steps, including:
     - Sending an appeal to the prefecture again (frequency: 15).
     - Notifying the offender of the result (frequency: 2, and 1 for receiving from payment).
     - Inserting a date appeal to the prefecture (frequency: 7 and 1).
     - Sending for credit collection (frequency: 1, and 3 for sending to appeal to prefecture).

4. **Appeal to Judge**
   - Appeals can be made to a judge from multiple sources:
     - Directly from creating a fine or receiving an appeal result from the prefecture (frequency: 4 each).
     - From inserting a date appeal to the prefecture (frequency: 15, 7, and 2).
     - From sending a fine (frequency: 10).
     - After being notified of an appeal result (frequency: 9).
     - Directly from other appeals to judge or receiving an appeal result from the prefecture (frequency: 9 and 1).

5. **Send Fine**
   - Fines can be sent after various actions, including:
     - Receiving a result appeal from the prefecture (frequency: 4).
     - From appealing to a judge (frequency: 4).
     - Directly from other appeals to the prefecture (frequency: 7).

6. **Insert Fine Notification** -> **Send Appeal to Prefecture**
   - After inserting a fine notification, an appeal is sent to the prefecture (frequency: 4).

7. **Payment**
   - Payment can occur after various actions:
     - Receiving a result appeal from the prefecture (frequency: 2).
     - Inserting a date appeal to the prefecture (frequency: 2).
     - Notifying an offender of an appeal result (frequency: 1).

9. **Send for Credit Collection** -> **Send Appeal to Prefecture**
   - After sending for credit collection, an appeal is sent to the prefecture (frequency: 3).

Here's a simplified visual representation of the process flow:

```
Create Fine -> Appeal to Judge
           |
           |-> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> ...
Receive Result Appeal -> ...
           |
           |-> Appeal to Judge -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> ...
Notify Result Appeal -> ...
Payment -> ...
```

The process involves creating fines, appealing decisions, and managing payments while allowing for multiple levels of appeals and notifications. The frequency and performance data provided give an idea of how often each step occurs and the volume of work handled at each stage.
