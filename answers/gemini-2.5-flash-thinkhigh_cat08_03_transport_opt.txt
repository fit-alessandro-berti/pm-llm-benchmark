As a Process Mining Consultant, I would approach Speedy Parcels' challenges by leveraging their rich event data to first understand the actual operations, then identify inefficiencies and their root causes, and finally propose data-driven strategies for improvement.

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

**Data Preprocessing and Integration:**
The crucial first step is transforming raw, heterogeneous data into a unified event log.

*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Varying Granularity & Frequency:** GPS data is very frequent, while scanner events are discrete. Dispatch data is static planning. Maintenance logs are sporadic.
    *   **Ambiguous Timestamps & IDs:** Ensuring consistent timestamp format (UTC preferred) and correctly linking events to the `Case ID` (Vehicle-Day) and potentially `Package ID` is vital.
    *   **Data Quality:** GPS drift, inaccurate manual scanner entries, missing events, or erroneous entries in maintenance logs.
    *   **Definition of Activities:** Mapping diverse raw events (e.g., `ignition on` from GPS, `Depart Depot` from scanner) to a consistent set of meaningful activities for process analysis.
    *   **Synthesizing Information:** For example, determining 'idle time' from GPS requires analyzing periods of 0 km/h where the ignition is on but not associated with a 'customer stop'.

*   **Preprocessing Steps:**
    1.  **Timestamp Normalization:** Convert all timestamps to a uniform format and timezone.
    2.  **Case ID Assignment:** Define `Case ID` as `Vehicle ID` + `Date` (e.g., V12-20241205). All events for a specific vehicle on a specific day fall into one case. For detailed package analysis, `Package ID` could be a sub-case or an attribute.
    3.  **Activity Definition & Mapping:**
        *   **Vehicle GPS:**
            *   `0 km/h for > X mins at non-customer location`: "Unscheduled Stop (Idle)"
            *   `Moving with speed > Y km/h`: "Driving"
            *   `Low Speed Detected (from GPS/Notes)`: "Traffic Delay"
            *   `Timestamp(Depot GPS) & First Movement`: "Depart Depot"
            *   `Timestamp(Depot GPS) & Last Movement`: "Arrive Depot"
            *   `Timestamp(Customer GPS) & 0 km/h`: "Arrive Customer (GPS est.)"
            *   `Timestamp(Customer GPS) & begin moving`: "Depart Customer (GPS est.)"
        *   **Driver Handheld Scanners:**
            *   `Scan at Depot`: "Package Loading Complete"
            *   `Arrive Customer`: "Arrive Customer (Scanner Confirmed)" - *Prioritize over GPS for accuracy*.
            *   `Delivery Success`: "Delivery Successful"
            *   `Delivery Failed (Attempted)`: "Delivery Failed"
            *   `Depart Customer`: "Depart Customer (Scanner Confirmed)" - *Prioritize over GPS*.
        *   **Dispatch System:**
            *   `Route Assigned`: "Route Assigned"
            *   `Planned Route Details`: Extract planned `sequence_of_stops`, `planned_time_windows`, `number_of_packages`. These become event attributes.
        *   **Maintenance Logs:**
            *   `Maintenance Start`: "Vehicle Maintenance Start"
            *   `Maintenance End`: "Vehicle Maintenance End"
            *   `Unscheduled Repair Start/End`: "Unscheduled Vehicle Repair"
    4.  **Event Aggregation & Enrichment:**
        *   Merge events based on `Case ID` and `Timestamp`. Where there's overlap (e.g., GPS and scanner `Arrive Customer`), prioritize the more precise source (scanner).
        *   Add relevant attributes to each event: `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID` (if applicable), `Location (Lat/Lon)`, `Speed`, `Notes`, `Planned Stop Order`, `Planned Time Window`, `Number of Packages on Vehicle`.
        *   Derive new attributes: `Time spent since last event`, `Distance travelled since last event`.
    5.  **Filtering & Cleansing:** Remove erroneous entries (e.g., impossible speeds), consolidate near-identical events, handle missing data using interpolation or flagging.

**Process Discovery:**
Using the integrated event log, process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristic Miner) will visualize the actual end-to-end process flow for a vehicle-day.

*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **Overall Flow:** From "Start Shift" to "End Shift," encompassing "Depart Depot," sequences of "Arrive Customer (Scanner Confirmed)," "Delivery Successful/Failed," "Depart Customer (Scanner Confirmed)," periods of "Driving," "Unscheduled Stop (Idle)," and "Arrive Depot."
    *   **Delivery Sub-Process:** Detailed flow from "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer," including "Delivery Successful" or "Delivery Failed" activities. Identify loops for re-delivery attempts.
    *   **Deviations:** Prominently display less frequent but significant paths, such as "Unscheduled Vehicle Repair" occurring mid-shift, or longer "Traffic Delay" segments.
    *   **Frequency and Performance:** Highlight the most common paths (variants), and annotate activities and transitions with average durations and frequencies to immediately spot where time is spent.

**Conformance Checking:**
This phase compares the discovered 'actual' process model against the 'planned' routes from the dispatch system.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Planned Model Creation:** Represent each planned route from the dispatch system as a reference process model (e.g., a sequence of expected customer stops).
    2.  **Alignment:** Use conformance checking algorithms to align each actual `Vehicle-Day` trace from the event log against its corresponding planned route. The algorithm identifies "fits" (where actual matches planned) and "deviations" (where actual deviates).
*   **Types of Deviations to Look For:**
    *   **Sequence Deviations:** Actual customer visit order differs from the planned order (e.g., planned A-B-C, actual A-C-B). This indicates drivers are re-optimizing on the fly or the planned route is inefficient.
    *   **Unplanned Stops (Insertions):** Presence of activities not in the planned route, such as "Unscheduled Stop (Idle)," "Unscheduled Vehicle Repair," or even visits to unplanned customer locations. These are often indicators of personal breaks, vehicle issues, or last-minute changes.
    *   **Missing Stops (Omissions):** Planned customer stops that were not visited or recorded as 'Arrive Customer'. This could indicate skipped deliveries or data capture issues.
    *   **Timing Deviations:**
        *   **Excessive Dwell Times:** The duration of "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer" or "Unscheduled Stop (Idle)" is significantly longer than an expected baseline or planned allowance.
        *   **Travel Time Variances:** Actual travel time between stops is significantly longer or shorter than estimated by the dispatch system.
        *   **Time Window Violations:** Deliveries happening outside the customer-requested time windows, identified by comparing 'Delivery Success' timestamp with `planned_time_window`.
    *   **Activity Deviations:** 'Delivery Failed' where 'Delivery Success' was expected.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

1.  **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTD):**
    *   *Definition:* Percentage of packages delivered within the customer-requested time window.
    *   *Calculation:* Count `Delivery Success` events where `Timestamp` is within `Planned Time Window` (derived from dispatch system) / Total `Delivery Success` events.
2.  **Average Time per Delivery Stop (Service Time):**
    *   *Definition:* Average duration a vehicle spends at a customer location.
    *   *Calculation:* Average of `Timestamp(Depart Customer) - Timestamp(Arrive Customer)` for all successful deliveries.
3.  **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:**
    *   *Definition:* Ratio of total time spent driving between stops to total time spent at customer locations.
    *   *Calculation:* (Sum of all `Driving` activity durations) / (Sum of all `Service Time` durations). A high ratio might indicate inefficient routing or traffic issues.
4.  **Fuel Consumption per km/package:**
    *   *Definition:* Operational cost efficiency metric. (Requires estimated fuel burn rates or integration with fuel card data, combined with distance/packages from log).
    *   *Calculation:* (Total Distance from GPS * Avg. Fuel Rate per km) / Total Packages Delivered. (If direct fuel data not available, use proxies like `Idle Time`, `High Speed Driving`, `Traffic Delay` events).
5.  **Vehicle Utilization Rate:**
    *   *Definition:* Percentage of total shift time a vehicle is actively driving or servicing customers.
    *   *Calculation:* (Sum of `Driving` duration + Sum of `Service Time` duration) / (`Timestamp(End Shift) - Timestamp(Start Shift)`).
6.  **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:**
    *   *Definition:* Number and average length of periods where vehicle speed drops significantly below expected, indicating congestion.
    *   *Calculation:* Count and measure duration of 'Low Speed Detected' events from GPS data, potentially correlating with average speeds for road segments.
7.  **Rate of Failed Deliveries:**
    *   *Definition:* Percentage of delivery attempts that were unsuccessful.
    *   *Calculation:* (Count of 'Delivery Failed' events) / (Count of 'Delivery Success' + 'Delivery Failed' events).

**Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**

*   **Process Map Annotation:**
    *   **Activity/Transition Durations:** Overlay mean/median durations on the discovered process map. Activities with high average durations (e.g., "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer" or segments of "Driving") are potential bottlenecks.
    *   **Frequency/Throughput:** Highlight paths with high frequency (e.g., specific sequences of stops) and trace throughput times across different paths.
*   **Throughput Time Analysis:**
    *   Break down the total `Case Duration` (`End Shift` - `Start Shift`) into its constituent parts: time spent `Driving`, `Servicing Customers`, `Idle`, `Unscheduled Stop (Maintenance/Personal)`, `Loading at Depot`.
    *   Analyze statistical distributions (mean, median, standard deviation, outliers) for each segment. Large standard deviations indicate high variability, which is a common source of unpredictability and bottlenecks.
*   **Resource Analysis (Driver/Vehicle Performance):**
    *   Group and compare KPIs (e.g., OTD, Avg. Service Time, Fuel Consumption) by `Driver ID` and `Vehicle ID`. Identify drivers/vehicles that consistently underperform.
    *   Drill down into their specific process variants to understand *why* they underperform (e.g., higher frequency of 'Unscheduled Stops', longer 'Service Times').
*   **Variant Analysis:**
    *   Group `Vehicle-Day` cases into variants based on their sequence of activities.
    *   Compare KPIs (e.g., average shift duration, average OTD) for high-frequency variants vs. low-frequency but high-cost/low-performance variants (e.g., routes with 'Unscheduled Vehicle Repair' or multiple 'Delivery Failed' attempts).
*   **Geospatial Analysis (Heatmaps):**
    *   Map `Low Speed Detected` events, `Unscheduled Stops`, or particularly long `Service Times` onto a geographical map. This helps identify traffic hotspots, areas with parking difficulties, or specific problematic customer locations.
*   **Time-Based Analysis:**
    *   Analyze KPIs by `Time of Day` and `Day of Week` to identify peak congestion hours, busy delivery periods, or shifts with consistently lower performance.
*   **Cost Overlay:** If cost models can be applied (e.g., hourly driver rate, fuel cost per km), overlay these on the process map to visually identify the most expensive activities or paths.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Process mining goes beyond *what* is happening to illuminate *why*.

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning (Static vs. Dynamic):**
    *   **PM Analysis:** Conformance checking will show frequent `Sequence Deviations` from planned routes. High `Travel Time Variances` where actual is consistently much longer than planned between certain stops or geographical areas suggests that static planning isn't accounting for real-world conditions. Analysis of `Unplanned Stops` (detours) can also highlight a need for dynamic adjustments.
    *   **Root Cause:** Reliance on fixed, pre-optimized routes that don't adapt to real-time traffic, delivery exceptions, or driver decisions.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
    *   **PM Analysis:** Direct comparison of actual `Timestamp(Depart X) - Timestamp(Arrive Y)` durations against dispatch system's estimated travel times. Segmenting this analysis by `time of day`, `day of week`, `location type` (urban vs. suburban) or `road type` will pinpoint where estimations are consistently off.
    *   **Root Cause:** Static travel time models that don't account for dynamic factors like congestion, road works, or driver habits.
*   **Impact of Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
    *   **PM Analysis:** High frequency and duration of `Low Speed Detected` events clustered geographically (heatmaps) and by time of day (time-based analysis) will directly show congestion impact. Correlate these with higher `Travel Time Variances` and lower `On-Time Delivery Rates` for affected routes/times.
    *   **Root Cause:** External factors (traffic) not adequately predicted or mitigated in planning or real-time operations.
*   **High Variability in Service Time at Customer Locations:**
    *   **PM Analysis:** Detailed `Throughput Time Analysis` on the 'Arrive Customer' to 'Depart Customer' segment. A large standard deviation in this duration, especially when segmented by `customer type` (residential, commercial, high-rise), `package size/weight`, `parking availability` (derived from GPS/notes), or `driver`, points to unpredictable service times.
    *   **Root Cause:** Inconsistent customer interaction times, difficult access (e.g., parking), variable package handling times, or lack of standardized delivery procedures.
*   **Frequency and Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns or Maintenance Needs during Shifts:**
    *   **PM Analysis:** `Variant Analysis` on `Vehicle-Day` cases containing "Unscheduled Vehicle Repair" events. Analyze frequency of these events per `Vehicle ID` and `Vehicle Age`. Measure the direct impact: `Lost Delivery Time`, `Uncompleted Deliveries`, and `Increased Shift Duration`. Integrate with `Maintenance Logs` to see if reactive repairs dominate over proactive maintenance.
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient preventive maintenance, aging fleet, or harsh driving styles contributing to premature wear.
*   **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences:**
    *   **PM Analysis:** `Resource Analysis` comparing `Driver IDs` based on KPIs like `OTD`, `Avg. Service Time`, `Fuel Consumption` (proxy via idle time/speeding), `Frequency of Unscheduled Stops`, `Rate of Failed Deliveries`. High-performing drivers' trace variants can be compared against low-performing ones to identify best practices or areas for training.
    *   **Root Cause:** Inconsistent adherence to procedures, lack of training, or personal habits impacting efficiency.
*   **Issues Related to Failed Delivery Attempts (Requiring Re-delivery):**
    *   **PM Analysis:** `Trace Analysis` of `Package IDs` that experience 'Delivery Failed'. Identify common preceding activities (e.g., long wait at customer location) and subsequent actions (re-delivery attempts, return to depot). Correlate 'Delivery Failed' events with `time of day` (`customer not home during business hours`), `customer type`, or `Notes` (e.g., "no access," "wrong address"). Quantify the `re-delivery loop` time and cost.
    *   **Root Cause:** Unrealistic customer time window expectations, lack of communication with customers, or issues with customer availability/access.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Here are three concrete, data-driven optimization strategies for Speedy Parcels:

1.  **Dynamic Real-Time Route Adjustment & Predictive ETAs**
    *   **Specific Inefficiency/Bottleneck:** Suboptimal static route planning, inaccurate travel time estimations, significant impact of traffic congestion, and poor OTD rate.
    *   **Underlying Root Cause:** Inability to react to real-time events (traffic, delivery exceptions, driver pace) and reliance on historical averages rather than predictive analytics.
    *   **How Process Mining Supports:**
        *   **Conformance Checking:** Reveals the high frequency of `Sequence Deviations` and `Travel Time Variances`, proving static routes are routinely suboptimal.
        *   **Performance Analysis:** Identifies specific traffic hotspots (`Low Speed Detected` clusters) and times of day/week that cause delays.
        *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Pinpoints the precise segments where travel time estimations are consistently inaccurate.
        *   **Service Time Analysis:** Provides data-driven, localized average service times that can be integrated into the dynamic model, rather than generic estimates.
    *   **Proposal:** Implement or integrate with a dynamic routing platform. This system would:
        *   Consume real-time traffic data (from GPS and external providers).
        *   Use the process mining-derived actual travel times and service times for segments and customer types.
        *   Continuously re-optimize the remaining stops on a driver's route throughout the day based on current location, traffic, remaining time windows, and unexpected delays.
        *   Provide drivers with real-time route adjustments and updated Estimated Times of Arrival (ETAs) via their handhelds.
        *   Proactively send updated ETAs or delay notifications to customers and dispatch based on these dynamic adjustments.
    *   **Expected Impacts:**
        *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Significantly increased due to reactive adjustments.
        *   **Fuel Consumption:** Reduced by minimizing time in traffic and optimizing travel paths.
        *   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Improved efficiency of movement.
        *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Higher, as less time is spent idling or on inefficient detours.

2.  **Predictive Fleet Maintenance Program**
    *   **Specific Inefficiency/Bottleneck:** High operational costs from unscheduled repairs, vehicle downtime during shifts, and impact on delivery schedules.
    *   **Underlying Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance approach or a purely time/mileage-based schedule that doesn't account for actual vehicle usage and wear patterns.
    *   **How Process Mining Supports:**
        *   **Maintenance Log & GPS Integration:** Correlates 'Unscheduled Vehicle Repair' events with specific `Vehicle IDs`, `Driver IDs`, `Vehicle Age`, and detailed usage patterns (e.g., `high-speed driving frequency`, `harsh braking events`, `excessive idle time` from GPS).
        *   **Variant Analysis:** Quantifies the `Lost Delivery Time` and `Uncompleted Deliveries` associated with unscheduled breakdowns, highlighting their high cost.
        *   **Resource Analysis:** Identifies vehicles that are statistically more prone to breakdowns based on their operational profile.
    *   **Proposal:** Develop a data-driven predictive maintenance schedule.
        *   Use historical process data to build models that predict the likelihood of a breakdown for each vehicle based on its usage patterns, mileage, age, and maintenance history.
        *   Identify "hot-running" vehicles or specific usage patterns that correlate with higher maintenance needs.
        *   Schedule preventive maintenance *before* expected failures, during off-peak hours or when vehicles are naturally available.
        *   Implement alerts for vehicle-specific performance deviations that might signal upcoming issues (e.g., prolonged `Low Speed Detected` at non-traffic times, indicating engine trouble).
    *   **Expected Impacts:**
        *   **Operational Costs:** Significantly reduced unscheduled repair costs, towing fees, and expedite charges for parts.
        *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Increased fleet availability, as vehicles are maintained proactively outside critical delivery windows.
        *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Improved reliability of the fleet, leading to fewer last-minute delivery disruptions.

3.  **Intelligent Customer Communication & Delivery Attempt Optimization**
    *   **Specific Inefficiency/Bottleneck:** High rate of failed deliveries, wasted driver time and fuel on re-delivery attempts, and negative customer experience.
    *   **Underlying Root Cause:** Customers not being available, inaccurate time window expectations, and insufficient proactive communication.
    *   **How Process Mining Supports:**
        *   **Failed Delivery Analysis:** Identifies the frequency, locations, and times of day where `Delivery Failed` events occur most often.
        *   **Correlation Analysis:** Links failed deliveries to specific customer types (e.g., residential vs. commercial), `Time of Day` (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM for residential), or `Notes` (e.g., "customer not home," "no access"). Quantifies the `re-delivery loop` duration and associated cost.
        *   **Dwell Time Analysis:** Can indicate if drivers are spending excessive time waiting for customers at locations that eventually result in a failed delivery.
    *   **Proposal:** Implement a multi-faceted approach to improve first-attempt delivery success:
        *   **Optimized Time Window Generation:** Use process mining insights (e.g., actual service times, traffic patterns, and failed delivery hot spots) to offer more precise and realistic delivery time windows to customers at the time of order. For example, suggesting wider windows for congested areas or specific hours for residential deliveries.
        *   **Proactive "On-My-Way" Notifications:** Leverage GPS data to trigger automated SMS/app notifications to customers when their delivery is "X stops away" or "Y minutes away" from their location. This allows customers to prepare for arrival.
        *   **Immediate Driver Feedback & Action:** If a driver faces an issue (e.g., no answer at door), the handheld scanner app can immediately prompt the driver to select a reason and trigger an automated message to the customer with options (e.g., "We attempted delivery, please reschedule," or "We are waiting, please come to the door/call").
    *   **Expected Impacts:**
        *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Drastically reduced.
        *   **Operational Costs:** Significant reduction in fuel and driver time for re-delivery attempts.
        *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Improved, as fewer parcels are delayed due to initial failures.
        *   **Customer Satisfaction:** Boosted by increased transparency and successful first-time delivery.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

**Accounting for Operational Constraints:**

It's crucial that any proposed optimization strategy respects the inherent constraints of last-mile delivery.

*   **Driver Working Hours & Regulations:**
    *   **Consideration:** All route planning (dynamic and static) must strictly adhere to legal driving and rest regulations (e.g., max driving hours, mandatory breaks).
    *   **PM Integration:** Process mining can continuously monitor actual driver work/rest patterns. The dynamic routing system must incorporate these rules, potentially alerting dispatch if a driver is nearing their limit or automatically re-assigning remaining packages.
*   **Vehicle Capacities (Volume/Weight):**
    *   **Consideration:** Vehicles have finite capacity. Routes must be planned such that the total package volume/weight doesn't exceed the specific van's limit.
    *   **PM Integration:** The dispatch system provides `assigned packages` and `vehicle capacity`. Process mining can analyze cases where vehicles consistently appear to be overloaded (e.g., unusually slow speeds or more frequent "Unscheduled Stop (Idle)" events, potentially for re-organization). The dynamic routing must ensure capacity constraints are respected when re-optimizing.
*   **Customer Time Windows (Hard vs. Soft):**
    *   **Consideration:** Customer-requested time windows are often non-negotiable.
    *   **PM Integration:** The optimization strategies will prioritize meeting hard time windows. Failed delivery analysis helps understand the cost of missing these. Dynamic routing will weigh meeting these windows higher than purely optimizing for shortest distance or time.
*   **Geographical Constraints:**
    *   **Consideration:** One-way streets, pedestrian zones, restricted access, delivery points requiring specific vehicle types (e.g., smaller vans for narrow streets).
    *   **PM Integration:** GPS data provides the actual paths taken, allowing validation against known geographical constraints. The routing system should incorporate up-to-date road network data.

**Continuous Monitoring Plan:**

Post-implementation, continuous monitoring via process mining dashboards is essential to ensure sustainability and adapt to new challenges.

*   **Process Mining Dashboards:** Develop interactive, real-time (or near real-time, refreshed daily/hourly) dashboards accessible to operations managers, dispatchers, and even drivers.
*   **Key Metrics to Track:**
    *   **Core KPIs:** OTD Rate (overall, by region, by driver), Average Time per Delivery Stop, Rate of Failed Deliveries, Vehicle Utilization Rate.
    *   **Efficiency Metrics:** Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio, Fuel Consumption proxy (e.g., idle time percentage).
    *   **Deviation Metrics:** Number/percentage of `Sequence Deviations`, `Unplanned Stops`, `Unscheduled Vehicle Repairs` (with causes).
    *   **Constraint Compliance:** Driver hours compliance, vehicle capacity adherence.
*   **Process Views to Track:**
    *   **Animated Process Maps:** Visually show the flow of cases, highlighting current bottlenecks or deviations. Observe changes in the 'normal' path.
    *   **Throughput Time Breakdowns:** Continuously monitor the distribution of time spent in `Driving`, `Service Time`, `Idle`, `Maintenance` to detect shifts.
    *   **Comparison Charts:** "Before-and-after" comparisons to quantify the impact of implemented changes. Compare different optimization strategies, drivers, or regions.
    *   **Case Explorer:** Enable quick drill-down into specific problematic cases (e.g., individual routes with very low OTD, or frequent `Delivery Failed` issues) to investigate root causes directly.
    *   **Geospatial Overlays:** Continuously updated heatmaps of 'Low Speed Detected', 'Unscheduled Stops', or 'Service Time' outliers to identify new congestion points or areas of inefficiency.
*   **Alerting System:** Configure automated alerts (email, SMS) for significant deviations from target KPIs or process norms (e.g., OTD drops below 90%, unscheduled stops increase by 10% week-over-week).
*   **Regular Review Meetings:** Institute a routine of weekly/bi-weekly meetings with stakeholders (Operations, Dispatch, Maintenance leads) to review dashboard insights, discuss emerging trends, and gather qualitative feedback on the effectiveness of the changes. This feedback loop is crucial for refinement and identifying new opportunities for optimization.
