The underlying decision process is biased in favor of Group B, and this bias is visible in the **Group B (unprotected group) log**. That bias harms Group A (protected group), which never receives the same advantage.

### 1. Where the bias shows up

Look at the **ScoreAdjustment** and who gets it:

- **Group A (Protected)**
  - LocalResident: always `FALSE`
  - CommunityGroup: always `None`
  - ScoreAdjustment: always `0`
  - Decisions:
    - P001: 720  Approved
    - P002: 710  Rejected
    - P003: 740  Approved

- **Group B (Unprotected)**
  - LocalResident: always `TRUE`
  - CommunityGroup:
    - U001: Highland Civic Darts Club
    - U002: None
    - U003: Highland Civic Darts Club
  - ScoreAdjustment:
    - U001: +10 (“Community Boost”)
    - U002: 0
    - U003: +10 (“Community Boost”)
  - Decisions:
    - U001: 720  730 (adjusted)  Approved
    - U002: 710  710 (no adj)  Rejected
    - U003: 695  705 (adjusted)  Approved

The **only cases that receive a positive ScoreAdjustment are in Group B and are members of a specific CommunityGroup** (“Highland Civic Darts Club”).

### 2. Concrete evidence of biased treatment

Compare similar cases across groups:

1. **Same preliminary score, different treatment**
   - P001 (Protected): 720, no community, score stays 720  Approved  
   - U001 (Unprotected + CommunityGroup): 720, gets +10  730  Approved  

   Here the outcomes are both approvals, but **U001 is given extra score for the same underlying risk**. That’s preferential treatment, even though it doesn’t change the final decision in this pair.

2. **Lower preliminary score, *better* outcome for unprotected**
   - P002 (Protected): 710, no adjustment  710  Rejected  
   - U003 (Unprotected + CommunityGroup): 695, +10  705  Approved  

   This is the clearest signal of bias:
   - U003 starts with a **lower** PreliminaryScore (695 vs 710),
   - But is **approved** thanks to the +10 community boost,
   - While P002, with a **higher** score and no boost, is **rejected**.

   So membership in a particular community group (which appears only in the unprotected group) lets weaker applicants (by raw score) obtain better outcomes than stronger applicants from the protected group.

### 3. Role of LocalResident and CommunityGroup

- **LocalResident**
  - Group A: always `FALSE`
  - Group B: always `TRUE`
  - The logs don’t show a direct numerical adjustment based on LocalResident, but LocalResident is **tightly coupled** with community membership: only locals seem to belong to “Highland Civic Darts Club.”

- **CommunityGroup**
  - Appears only in Group B, and specifically:
    - “Highland Civic Darts Club”  triggers a **+10 (Community Boost)**.
  - No protected-group applicant is in any community group, so **they can never receive the boost**.

- **ScoreAdjustment**
  - Implemented as an explicit bonus for certain community members.
  - In practice, this makes the effective approval threshold **lower** for unprotected community members than for protected applicants.

### 4. How this creates systematic differences

Putting it together:

- Only **unprotected, local applicants with a specific CommunityGroup** get a positive ScoreAdjustment.
- Protected-group applicants:
  - Are never LocalResident,
  - Never belong to that CommunityGroup,
  - Therefore **never receive the +10 boost**.
- As a result:
  - Some unprotected applicants with **worse underlying scores** (e.g., 695) are approved.
  - Protected applicants with **better underlying scores** (e.g., 710) are rejected.

This is a clear case of **disparate treatment**: the system applies different scoring rules based on attributes (LocalResident + CommunityGroup) that, in practice, benefit only the unprotected group. That creates a **systematic advantage** for Group B and a corresponding disadvantage for Group A.
