To produce the comprehensive event log suitable for process mining, we need to integrate the data from the provided tables and map each event to the correct `order_id` and timestamp. We will also enrich the event log with additional information such as resources and actor details.

### Assumptions and Notes:
1. **Order Dispatch/Arrival**: For orders with multiple deliveries, both dispatch and arrival events are recorded for each shipment.
2. **Invoice Issued**: Multiple invoices can be issued for a single order, and each is recorded separately.
3. **Payment Received**: Each payment is linked to the corresponding invoice and recorded as a separate event.
4. **Activity Naming**: Activity names are derived logically from the context, ensuring clarity for process mining.
5. **Timestamp Ordering**: All timestamps are sorted chronologically to reflect the actual flow of the business process.
6. **Optional Attributes**: Additional attributes like `Customer`, `Sales Person`, and `Carrier Notes` are included for context where applicable.

This event log provides a detailed and chronological view of the business process, suitable for further analysis and process mining.
