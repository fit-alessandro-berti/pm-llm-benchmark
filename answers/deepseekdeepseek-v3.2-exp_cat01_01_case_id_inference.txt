Let's analyze the events step by step, grouping them by **patient_age**, **patient_gender**, and the logical flow of activities for each patient.

### **Step 1: Identify unique patients**
From the log:

1. **Patient A** — age 45, gender M, appears in ER (Register  Initial triage  X-ray  Doctor consultation  Discharge from ER)  
2. **Patient B** — age 62, gender F, appears in ER (Register  Initial triage  Lab test requested  Lab test completed  Doctor consultation  Prescription  Discharge from ER)  
3. **Patient C** — age 28, gender M, appears in Surgery (Register  Doctor consultation  Surgery preparation  Surgery performed  Recovery room  Discharge from Surgery)

### **Step 2: Assign events to each patient**

**Patient A (45, M, ER):**
1. Register patient — ER — 08:05:13  
4. Initial triage — ER — 08:10:50  
7. X-ray imaging — Radiology — 08:15:42  
12. Doctor consultation — ER — 08:23:10  
15. Patient discharged — ER — 08:30:05  

**Patient B (62, F, ER):**
2. Register patient — ER — 08:07:02  
5. Initial triage — ER — 08:12:29  
8. Lab test requested — ER — 08:16:10  
10. Lab test completed — Laboratory — 08:20:27  
11. Doctor consultation — ER — 08:22:54  
14. Prescription created — ER — 08:27:00  
17. Patient discharged — ER — 08:35:29  

**Patient C (28, M, Surgery):**
3. Register patient — Surgery — 08:07:15  
6. Doctor consultation — Surgery — 08:13:00  
9. Surgery preparation — Surgery — 08:16:45  
13. Surgery performed — Surgery — 08:25:19  
16. Recovery room — Surgery — 08:31:37  
18. Patient discharged — Surgery — 08:40:13

### **Step 3: Verify consistency**
- No event is left unassigned.  
- Each case’s events are in logical order and match department and patient info.  
- Timestamps within each case are sequential (allowing for interleaving with other cases).

### **Final grouping:**

**Case 1 (Patient A, 45, M):**  
Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15

**Case 2 (Patient B, 62, F):**  
Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17

**Case 3 (Patient C, 28, M):**  
Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
