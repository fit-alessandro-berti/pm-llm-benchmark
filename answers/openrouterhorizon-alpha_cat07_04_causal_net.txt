This is a business process model shown as a Petri net with labeled transitions (rounded rectangles) and places (black dots) connected by arcs.

Main process (left to right):
- a: register request (start) leads to three alternative examinations:
  - b: examine thoroughly
  - c: examine casually
  - d: check ticket
- From these, tokens flow to e: decide. There are loops back via f: reinitiate request (allowing reconsideration after d/c/b) and an arc from e back to earlier tasks, modeling rework.
- After e, the case proceeds to either:
  - g: pay compensation, or
  - h: reject request
- Both paths converge to z: end.

Control-flow patterns:
- The inset legend explains how XOR-, AND-, and OR-splits/joins are represented in this Petri-net style:
  - XOR-split/join: exactly one path taken/required.
  - AND-split/join: all paths taken/required (parallelism).
  - OR-split/join: any non-empty subset of paths taken/required.

Overall, the diagram shows a claim-handling process with examination options, a decision step, optional reinitiation, and two possible outcomes, using Petri-net notation to capture branching, synchronization, and loops.
