### Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

To analyze the current scheduling performance and dynamics at Precision Parts Inc., we will use process mining techniques to reconstruct and visualize job execution sequences as well as their impact on various metrics such as lead times, makespan distributions, resource utilization, and tardiness.

#### Process Mining Techniques and Metrics

**1. Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
   - **Process Discovery:** Use event logs to discover the structure of processes (e.g., work centers, machines) and their connections through events.
   - **Event Log Analysis:** Calculate job flow times as the difference between start and end timestamps for each case. Lead times can be derived by subtracting job release time from due date. Makespan distributions will show how long jobs typically take to complete.

**2. Task Waiting Times (Queue Times) at Each Work Center/Machine:**
   - Use event log analysis to identify waiting events where a task is scheduled but not yet started.
   - Calculate mean and distribution of waiting times using statistical methods like Kaplan-Meier estimators or empirical distributions.

**3. Resource Utilization:**
   - **Resource Allocation Analysis:** Track resource usage by monitoring when resources are allocated (setup start) and deallocated (task end).
   - Calculate productive time, idle time, and setup time for each machine/operator.
   - Use event log data to identify periods of high or low utilization.

**4. Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
   - Analyze historical data where the duration of setups varies based on the sequence of jobs processed.
   - Develop a predictive model using historical job sequences (e.g., clustering methods) and machine properties (e.g., operator skill, tool wear). Implement a mechanism to estimate setup times for new jobs based on their position in the schedule relative to previously completed jobs.

**5. Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
   - Identify deviations from due dates using the deviation between planned and actual completion times.
   - Use statistical methods like Gini coefficient or Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) to quantify tardiness.
   - Compare on-time jobs with late ones to identify specific patterns contributing to delays.

**6. Impact of Disruptions:**
   - Identify breakdowns, urgent job changes, and other disruptions using event logs.
   - Calculate the effect of these events on overall process performance using impact analysis metrics like Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR).

### Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Based on the above analysis, we can diagnose the following scheduling pathologies:

**1. Bottleneck Resources:**
   - Identify machines with high utilization rates, low availability, or frequent breakdowns.
   - Quantify their impact using metrics like Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and Mean Availability.

**2. Poor Task Prioritization:**
   - Compare on-time jobs with late ones in terms of priority levels to identify if higher-priority tasks are consistently delayed.
   - Examine the effect of resource contention periods where certain machines experience high load while others remain idle.

**3. Suboptimal Sequencing:**
   - Use variant analysis comparing on-time vs. late jobs to identify suboptimal sequencing strategies.
   - Analyze historical data to detect recurring patterns in setup times that correlate with poor job sequences.

**4. Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
   - Identify instances where upstream machines are overloaded, causing downstream resources to experience delays or starvation.
   - Use resource contention periods and task execution durations to quantify the impact on overall throughput.

**5. Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
   - Analyze historical data for fluctuations in Work-In-Progress (WIP) levels over time.
   - Compare WIP trends between high-priority jobs, low-priority jobs, and those with critical due dates to identify potential bottlenecks in the supply chain.

### Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

**1. Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:**
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of existing rules like First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) or Earliest Due Date (EDD).
   - Examine if these rules account for sequence-dependent setup times and other job-specific characteristics.

**2. Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
   - Analyze the impact of delays caused by missing real-time data on scheduling decisions.
   - Identify instances where unexpected events, such as unplanned breakdowns or urgent jobs, led to suboptimal schedules.

**3. Inaccurate Task Duration/Setup Time Estimations:**
   - Compare planned and actual task durations using statistical methods like Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
   - Identify patterns in overestimation or underestimation of setup times to understand the root causes.

**4. Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
   - Use historical data and clustering techniques to model sequence-dependent setup times for different machines.
   - Compare these models with actual observed setup durations to evaluate their accuracy and effectiveness.

**5. Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:**
   - Analyze communication gaps between work centers through event logs.
   - Identify instances where upstream decisions impact downstream processes, leading to delays or inefficiencies.

### Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules
To address poor task prioritization and suboptimal sequencing, we propose enhanced dispatching rules that consider multiple factors simultaneously:

**Core Logic:**
- **Multi-Criteria Decision-Making:** Incorporate variables such as remaining processing time, due date, priority level, downstream machine load, and estimated sequence-dependent setup times.
- **Weighted Scheduling:** Assign weights to each factor based on their impact on overall efficiency. For example:
  - High-priority tasks (weight: 0.4)
  - Tasks with critical due dates (weight: 0.35)
  - Task duration estimations (weight: 0.2)
  - Sequence-dependent setup times (weight: 0.05)

**Example Implementation:**
- **Task Allocation Algorithm:** Prioritize jobs that are either high-priority, have a critical due date, or have relatively shorter durations and lower sequence-dependent setup times.
- **Real-Time Adjustments:** Regularly update weights based on historical performance data to account for evolving job characteristics.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling
To proactively address potential bottlenecks and delays, we propose predictive scheduling using historical task duration distributions:

**Core Logic:**
- **Historical Distributions Analysis:** Fit empirical distributions (e.g., Weibull or Lognormal) to historical data of task durations.
- **Dynamic Modeling:** Use these models to predict future task durations based on job characteristics and machine condition.

**Example Implementation:**
- **Task Duration Estimation Model:** Train a predictive model using past task durations. Incorporate features like operator skill, tool wear, and sequence-dependent setup times as input variables.
- **Proactive Scheduling:** Generate schedules that anticipate potential bottlenecks or delays by adjusting job sequencing and resource allocation.

#### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization
To minimize the impact of sequence-dependent setups on overall efficiency, we propose an optimization strategy based on intelligent batching and optimized sequencing:

**Core Logic:**
- **Batching Jobs with Similar Properties:** Group jobs that have similar setup requirements to reduce variability in task durations.
- **Optimized Sequencing at Bottleneck Machines:** Use historical data to identify optimal job sequences at bottleneck machines. This can be achieved through:
  - Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group jobs based on their characteristics.
  - Reinforcement learning models that adaptively learn the best sequencing patterns.

**Example Implementation:**
- **Job Batching Algorithm:** Implement a batching algorithm that groups similar jobs together before sending them to the same machine. This reduces the number of setups needed and stabilizes task durations.
- **Sequencing Optimization Models:** Use reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms to find the optimal sequence for each job on bottleneck machines, minimizing setup times.

### Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

To rigorously test and compare the effectiveness of our proposed scheduling strategies before deployment, we will use discrete-event simulation:

**Simulation Approach:**
- **Parameterization:** Integrate historical data from process mining (task durations, breakdown frequencies, job release patterns) into a simulation model.
- **Scenario Testing:** Simulate high-load scenarios with frequent disruptions to test the robustness of each strategy under different conditions.

**Evaluation Framework:**
- Compare baseline performance (current static dispatching rules) against new strategies using metrics like makespan, tardiness, WIP levels, and resource utilization.
- Use KPIs (e.g., average lead time, job flow times, setup durations) to evaluate the overall effectiveness of each strategy.

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- **Ongoing Process Mining:** Continuously monitor process flows, identify new bottlenecks, and detect deviations from planned schedules.
- **Automated Updates:** Implement an automated mechanism that triggers updates to scheduling rules based on real-time data (e.g., changes in job characteristics, machine availability).
- **Feedback Loops:** Incorporate user feedback into the simulation model to refine strategies over time.

By leveraging process mining techniques and sophisticated scheduling approaches, Precision Parts Inc. can significantly improve their operations by addressing historical inefficiencies, identifying key pathologies, and continuously adapting to changing conditions.
