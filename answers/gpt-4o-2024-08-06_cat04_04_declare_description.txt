The process described by this DECLARE declarative process model involves a series of activities related to managing declarations and payments, typically found in bureaucratic or organizational settings. Here's a narrative that explains the process:

### Core Activities:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration. This step is mandatory as it's the Initialization of the process.

2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: After submission, the declaration must be final-approved by a supervisor. The Exactly 1 constraint means it happens precisely once during the process.

3. **Request Payment**: Following approval, a payment request is made. Each declaration process involves exactly one payment request.

4. **Payment Handled**: Finally, the payment is processed, which completes the cycle. Again, this activity occurs exactly once per process instance.

### Constraints and Dependencies:

- **Existence** constraints ensure that each of these core activities occurs at least once in every valid instance of the process.
  
- **Exactly 1** constraints enforce that each activity happens only once, indicating a linear, step-by-step nature of the process.

- **Responded Existence**: This ensures that certain activities, if they occur, imply the occurrence of other specified activities. For example, if a 'Request Payment' occurs, 'Payment Handled' must also occur.

- **Precedence and Alternate Precedence**: These constraints maintain a specific order between the activities. For instance, 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' should precede 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled'.

- **Response and Alternate Response**: Response constraints ensure that if a certain activity occurs, another specified activity will follow later. This helps in maintaining integrity across the different stages of the process.

- **Succession and Alternate Succession**: These constraints are stronger variations of response and precedence, ensuring direct succession without interruption.

- **Chain Response and Chain Precedence**: These indicate that certain activities must occur directly after another, not just eventually, enforcing stricter control over sequence.

- **Non Co-Existence** and **Non Succession**: Ensure certain combinations of activities do not occur in the same instance or in direct succession, although these specific rules are not explicitly stated for your activities.

- **Absence Constraints**: A series of activities related to the declaration (e.g., various rejection and approval stages by different roles, like EMPLOYEE, SUPERVISOR, or ADMINISTRATION) must not occur, indicating that the model is designed for straightforward processing without intermediate approvals or rejections.

- **Co-Existence**: This assures that related activities happen within the same process instance, promoting cohesion among different steps.

#### Overall Process Flow:

1. **Start**: The process initiates with the activity "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE."

2. **Approval**: The declaration must be approved by a supervisor to move forward.

3. **Payment Request and Handling**: The process requires a payment request and concludes with the handling of the payment.

This workflow creates a straightforward declaration and payment process with a clear starting point and a linear progression through to payment handling. The constraints ensure that while the process is flexible in some respects (via Responded Existence and Co-Existence), it is also strictly controlled concerning the order and exact execution of mandatory activities.
