Here's a Python dictionary representing the **temporal profile** of the **global supply chain process** for high-tech electronics manufacturing. The dictionary contains estimated **average times (in seconds)** and **standard deviations** for activity pairs that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution.  

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 21600),   # 1 day avg, 6-hour variability
    ('SS', 'RC'): (259200, 43200),  # 3 days avg, 12-hour variability
    ('SS', 'QI'): (276480, 43200),  # 3.2 days avg, 12-hour variability
    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 28800),  # 2 days avg, 8-hour variability
    ('OP', 'QI'): (190080, 28800),  # 2.2 days avg, 8-hour variability
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 14400),   # 1 day avg, 4-hour variability
    ('RC', 'CA'): (129600, 21600),  # 1.5 days avg, 6-hour variability
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 10800),   # 0.5 days avg, 3-hour variability
    ('QI', 'PT'): (172800, 28800),  # 2 days avg, 8-hour variability
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 21600),   # 1 day avg, 6-hour variability
    ('CA', 'PK'): (259200, 43200),  # 3 days avg, 12-hour variability
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 10800),   # 0.5 days avg, 3-hour variability
    ('PT', 'WS'): (86400, 21600),   # 1 day avg, 6-hour variability
    ('PK', 'WS'): (43200, 10800),   # 0.5 days avg, 3-hour variability
    ('PK', 'DT'): (86400, 21600),   # 1 day avg, 6-hour variability
    ('WS', 'DT'): (43200, 10800),   # 0.5 days avg, 3-hour variability
    ('DT', 'AS'): (259200, 86400),  # 3 days avg, 1-day variability
    ('SS', 'DT'): (691200, 172800), # 8 days avg, 2-day variability
    ('SS', 'AS'): (1209600, 259200),# 14 days avg, 3-day variability
    ('OP', 'DT'): (604800, 172800), # 7 days avg, 2-day variability
    ('RC', 'AS'): (1036800, 216000),# 12 days avg, 2.5-day variability
}
```

### **Explanation of Estimates**
- **Shorter Delays (Hours to Days)**:  
  - **Tightly connected steps** (e.g., `QI â†’ CA`, `PT â†’ PK`) have smaller delays (0.5â€“1 day).
  - **Production-related activities** (`RC â†’ QI`, `CA â†’ PT`) are typically within a couple of days.
- **Medium Delays (Several Days)**:  
  - **Logistics-heavy steps** (e.g., `SS â†’ RC`, `OP â†’ QI`) take 2-3 days.
  - **Assembly to packaging & warehouse processes** (`CA â†’ PK`, `PT â†’ WS`) take a few days due to batching, scheduling, or waiting times.
- **Longer Delays (Up to Weeks)**:  
  - **Cross-process transitions** like `SS â†’ DT` (supplier selection to distribution) can take over a week.
  - **End-to-end supply chain movements** (`SS â†’ AS`, `RC â†’ AS`) reflect how long after production customers engage in after-sales support (up to two weeks).  

This **temporal profile** models both direct and eventual transitions, capturing the variability inherent in global supply chains. ðŸššðŸ“¦
