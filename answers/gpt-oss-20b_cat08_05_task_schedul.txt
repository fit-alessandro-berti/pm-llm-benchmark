We need to produce a detailed answer with sections. Must use LaTeX for math expressions. Use code formatting where needed. Provide deep explanation.

We must not mention the model unless asked; not asked.

We need to structure: 1) Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics, with subpoints and process mining techniques: conformance, performance, bottleneck analysis, sequence-dependent setup analysis etc. Provide metrics formulas maybe.


1. 
Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies: identify pathologies using process mining evidence.



2. 
Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness: discuss root causes and how process mining helps differentiate scheduling logic vs capacity limitations.



3. 
Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies: propose three strategies with core logic, use of data insights, addressing pathologies, expected KPI impact.



4. 
Simulation, Evaluation & Continuous Improvement: simulation approach with parameterization from logs; scenarios; continuous monitoring framework using ongoing process mining; drift detection etc.



Need to include LaTeX for formulas like tardiness T = max(0, completion - due). Use double dollar for display math. Use escaped parentheses for inline math \(...\).

Also code blocks in markdown with language extension e.g., python or SQL if needed. But likely no code required except maybe pseudocode or algorithmic steps in markdown code block (language unspecified). We can use "python" or "text". We'll keep simple.

Let's craft answer accordingly.

**1 – Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**  
*Goal:* Re‑create the real shop‑floor execution from the MES log and quantify every dimension that matters for a job‑shop scheduler (flow times, waiting times, utilization…).

| What we want | Process‑Mining Tool / Technique | How it is applied |
|--------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Event‑log reconstruction** | *Petri net discovery* (e.g., α‑algorithm + Inductive Miner) | The raw log is cleaned (duplicate events removed), then a Petri net is mined that represents the *actual* routing of each job through its tasks on each machine. |
| **Flow / lead time distributions** | *Performance conformance* + *time series extraction* | For every case we compute `completion_time – release_time`. The resulting histogram shows makespan distribution; percentiles (\(P_{50}\), \(P_{90}\)) give typical vs worst lead times. |
| **Task waiting (queue) times** | *Time‑point extraction* + *resource view* | For each task start event we subtract the previous event’s end time on the same resource → queue time at that machine. Aggregated per resource gives average queue length over time via Little’s Law \(\bar{L}= \lambda \bar{W}\). |
| **Utilization & idle periods** | *Resource utilisation view* + *interval analysis* | Productive time = sum of all task durations on a machine; idle = total schedule window – productive – setup – breakdown downtime. Setup fractions are extracted by flagging `Setup Required` events. |
| **Sequence–dependent setup times** | *Variant analysis + clustering* | For every pair of consecutive jobs on a machine we record `(prev_job_type , next_job_type , setup_duration)` → build an empirical transition matrix \(S_{ij}\). Clustering similar transitions reveals “setup families” that can be precomputed or approximated by regression models \(S_{ij} = f(\text{job\_features})\). |
| **Schedule adherence / tardiness** | *Conformance check against due dates* + *tardiness metric*\(T_j=\max(0,\text{completion}_j-\text{due}_j)\)| Compute mean tardiness \(\overline{T}\), % late jobs (\(|\{T_j>0\}|/N\)), and distribution tails (\(P(T>30\,\text{min})\)). |
| **Impact of disruptions** | *Event segmentation & KPI comparison* | Split the log into “normal” vs “disruption” windows (breakdown start/end events). Compare KPIs before/after disruption to quantify loss in throughput or increase in WIP.*

### 2 – Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Using the metrics above we can pinpoint concrete inefficiencies:

1. **Bottleneck resources**
   - Compute throughput per resource (`jobs_processed / total_time`).  
   - Identify resources whose utilization > 95 % while others < 70 %.  
   - Correlate bottleneck queues with downstream WIP spikes → evidence of starvation downstream.
2. **Poor prioritisation**
   - Separate cases by priority level; compare mean tardiness per priority group.
   - Variant analysis shows high‐priority jobs often queued behind low‐priority ones at upstream machines.
3. **Excessive sequence–dependent setups**
   - Sum all setup durations per machine over a month → identify machines where setups consume > 30 % of productive time.
   - Cluster sequences revealing frequent switches between dissimilar job types.
4. **Starvation caused by upstream decisions**
   - Trace back long downstream queues to upstream tasks that finish late but still occupy critical machines.
5. **Bullwhip effect in WIP**
   - Plot rolling average WIP per work center over weeks; observe spikes coinciding with scheduling changes or hot orders.
6. **Disruption sensitivity**
   - Compare pre/post breakdown KPIs: e.g., mean lateness increases from 12 min to 45 min after a breakdown at MILL‑02.

All these diagnostics are derived directly from process‑mining visualisations (process maps coloured by performance metrics), variant trees highlighting frequent paths versus rare but costly ones, and statistical summaries produced automatically by tools such as ProM or Celonis.

### 3 – Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The diagnostics above point to several underlying causes:

- **Static dispatching rules ignore dynamic context:** FCFS/Earlies Due Date do not account for current queue lengths or upcoming setups → suboptimal sequencing persists even when conditions change rapidly.
- **Lack of real‑time visibility:** Operators rely on manual status boards rather than an integrated dashboard fed by live logs → decisions are made on stale information.
- **Inaccurate duration estimates:** Planned durations are often based on nominal values rather than historical distributions conditioned on job size/operator skill → schedules become optimistic quickly.
- **Sequence–dependent setups not modelled:** Current planners treat all setups as equal cost ⇒ they cannot optimise sequencing to minimise cumulative setup overheads.
- **Poor coordination across work centers:** Each center optimises locally without knowledge of downstream constraints ⇒ upstream bottlenecks propagate delays downstream (“downstream starvation”).
- **Reactive rather than proactive handling of disruptions:** Breakdowns trigger ad hoc rescheduling instead of predictive mitigation based on maintenance history or failure probabilities.

Process mining helps separate these effects:

- By comparing actual vs planned durations we see whether delays stem from estimation errors (`planned ≠ actual`) versus capacity limits (`idle > threshold`).
- Bottleneck identification shows whether high utilisation is due to inherent capacity limits (machine speed) or poor sequencing (high setup overhead).
- Disruption impact curves reveal whether downtime alone explains lateness spikes or if cascading effects amplify them—indicating coordination issues rather than just capacity constraints.

### 4 – Developing Advanced Data‑Driven Scheduling Strategies

Below are three complementary strategies built upon insights extracted via process mining:

#### Strategy 1 – Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules  

**Core Logic**

For each ready task at a work centre compute an urgency score:
$$
U_i = w_1\,\frac{\Delta t_{\text{due}}}{R_i} 
      + w_2\,\frac{\Delta t_{\text{remaining}}}{R_i}
      + w_3\,S_{\pi(i)} 
      + w_4\,L_{\text{downstream}}
$$
where:
- \(\Delta t_{\text{due}}\): minutes until due date,
- \(\Delta t_{\text{remaining}}\): estimated remaining processing time,
- \(R_i\): current queue length,
- \(S_{\pi(i)}\): estimated sequence–dependent set up cost if this task follows currently scheduled one,
- \(L_{\text{downstream}}\): projected load at next station derived from variant frequency tables,
and weights \(w_k\) tuned via regression against historical tardiness minimisation objective functions obtained from past logs.

The highest score gets dispatched first (“urgency‐first”).  

Process Mining Input:
- Estimated set up matrix \(S_{ij}\),
- Downstream load statistics,
- Historical correlation between urgency scores and actual lateness reduction (used for weight calibration).

Addressed Pathology:
• Poor prioritisation & starved downstream resources  
• Excessive sequence‐dependent set ups  

Expected KPI Impact:
• Mean tardiness ↓ ≈ 25 %  
• Queue lengths shrink uniformly across stations  

#### Strategy 2 – Predictive Realistic Schedules  

**Core Logic**

Generate schedules using stochastic simulation informed by mined distributions:

1️⃣ Build conditional probability density functions for task duration given job attributes (`size`, `operator`, `material`).  
2️⃣ Estimate failure probability per machine using Bayesian updating from breakdown logs (`P(breakdown)=α/(α+β)` where α=count successes before failure).  
3️⃣ Run Monte Carlo forward simulations over horizon H days producing multiple schedule scenarios capturing uncertainty in both processing times and failures.\newline
Select schedule that minimises expected weighted sum:
$$
J = E[\sum_j w_j T_j] 
$$
where weights reflect penalty curves derived empirically from customer contracts (`w_j` higher near due date).

Process Mining Input:
– Duration histograms conditioned on features  
– Breakdown frequency models per resource  
– Penalty curves inferred from historical penalty payments

Addressed Pathology:
• Inaccurate duration estimates leading to optimistic plans  
• Reactive handling of unplanned breakdowns  

Expected KPI Impact:
• Lead-time variance ↓ ≈ 40 %  
• Predictable hot-job insertion without major ripple effects  

#### Strategy 3 – Setup Time Optimisation via Intelligent Batching  

**Core Logic**

Treat each bottleneck machine as an optimisation problem:

Minimise total set up cost subject to throughput constraint:
$$
\min_\pi \sum_{k=1}^{n} S_{\pi(k),\,\pi(k+1)} 
\\
s.t.\;\;\sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k/\mu_\ell \leq T_\ell,\;\forall~machines~ℓ
$$

Where π is permutation over pending jobs at that station during planning window Tℓ . Solve using heuristic metaheuristics guided by historical transition frequencies—jobs frequently following one another get higher priority in batching lists (“setup clusters”). After batching decide exact order within cluster based solely on due dates/priority so as not to sacrifice urgency too much.

Process Mining Input:
– Transition matrix Sij built earlier   
– Cluster detection results showing high-probability sequences   
– Empirical benefit measurement: compare cluster-based schedules vs random ordering in replay experiments

Addressed Pathology:
• Excessive sequence-dependent set ups consuming >30 % productive time    
• Bottleneck overload caused partly by frequent reconfigurations

Expected KPI Impact:
• Setup overhead ↓ ≈ 35 %   
• Throughput ↑ ~10 % while maintaining same lateness levels

### 5 – Simulation, Evaluation & Continuous Improvement

#### Discrete Event Simulation Framework

Create an agent-based simulator mirroring the shop floor:

```python
class JobAgent(pydantic.BaseModel):
    id:str
    routing:list[Task]
    release_time:int          # epoch seconds
    
class Task(pydantic.BaseModel):
    activity:str              # Cutting/Milling...
    duration_dist:pymc.Distribution     # sampled from mined pdf
    
class MachineAgent(pydantic.BaseModel):
    id:str
    speed_factor:float        # μℓ
    
def simulate(strategy:str):
    env=pysim.Environment()
    ...
```

Parameterise:

| Parameter            | Source                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Task durations       | Mined PDFs conditioned on attributes  |
| Routing probabilities?         |\#jobs per route observed               |
| Breakdown rates      |\#breakdowns/time unit                   |
| Setup matrices       |\(S_{ij}\) empirical                      |

Run scenarios:

1️⃣ Baseline static dispatching rule × normal load (~70 % utilisation).  
2️⃣ Baseline × high load (~90 % utilisation).  
3️⃣ Each proposed strategy × normal load & high disruption frequency (+20 % breakdown rate).

Collect KPIs after burn-in period (>100 simulated days):

```
mean_tardiness     : avg(T)
p90_tardiness      : percentile(T)
mean_WIP           : avg(WIP)
utilization        : prod_time/(prod+idle+setup+breakdown)
```

Statistical tests (ANOVA/Tukey HSD) confirm significance differences among strategies before deployment.



#### Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation Loop

```
while True:
    new_log_chunk = fetch_latest_events()
    update_process_model(new_log_chunk)
    
    # KPI extraction every shift
    kpis = compute_kpis(new_log_chunk)
    
    # Drift detection via EWMA control charts
    if kpis.mean_tardiness > upper_control_limit_Tardy():
        alert("Late trend")
        adjust_weights(strategy='dispatch', factor=-0.xx)

    if new_breakdowns_detected():
        update_breakdown_model()
    
    sleep(interval=15 min)
```

Key components:

1️⃣ Real-time event ingestion into streaming analytics engine (Kafka→Spark Structured Streaming→ProM API).  
2️⃣ Automatic re-discovery every hour keeps routing map current despite occasional new custom routings introduced manually (“hot orders”).  
3️⃣ Adaptive weight tuning uses online gradient descent minimizing rolling mean tardiness—ensuring strategy remains optimal under changing demand patterns.



By coupling rigorous simulation validation with live data-driven monitoring you guarantee that any deployed scheduling policy continuously learns from reality while protecting against drift toward suboptimal behaviour.

In summary,

* Process mining turns raw MES logs into actionable quantitative insights about flow times, waiting periods, utilization patterns and especially sequence-dependent set-ups and disruption impacts.*  

* These insights expose concrete pathologies—bottlenecks, mis-prioritisation, excessive set-ups—that cannot be fixed merely by tweaking static rules.*  

*A trio of advanced data-driven strategies—dynamic dispatching weighted by urgency factors derived empirically; predictive realistic scheduling incorporating stochastic processing/failure models; intelligent batching reducing cumulative set-up costs—directly addresses those pathologies.*  

*A disciplined simulation framework validates their effectiveness under varied operating conditions before any live roll-out,* 

and finally,

*a continuous monitoring loop powered again by process mining ensures sustained improvement even as demand patterns evolve.*
