Looking at the event log, I can identify the following patterns:

1. **Sequential start**: OR  MS  QS (always in this order)
2. **Assembly phase with quality checks**: AS followed by optional iterations of IQC  AS
3. **Testing phase**: TST followed by optional iterations of RT  TST
4. **Packaging**: PK (always occurs)
5. **Optional labeling**: LB can be present or skipped (Case 2 skips it)
6. **Sequential end**: DP  D (always in this order)

Based on these observations, here's the POWL model:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities as transitions
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Create loop for assembly and quality check
# Loop executes AS first, then optionally IQC followed by AS again
as_iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])

# Create loop for testing and re-testing
# Loop executes TST first, then optionally RT followed by TST again
tst_rt_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Create choice for optional labeling
# Either execute LB or skip it
lb_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

# Create the root partial order with all nodes
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, as_iqc_loop, tst_rt_loop, PK, lb_choice, DP, D])

# Define the sequential ordering
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, as_iqc_loop)
root.order.add_edge(as_iqc_loop, tst_rt_loop)
root.order.add_edge(tst_rt_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, lb_choice)
root.order.add_edge(lb_choice, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

This POWL model captures:
- The strict sequential flow from order receipt through distribution
- The loop pattern for assembly/quality checks (AS can be followed by IQC and back to AS multiple times)
- The loop pattern for testing/re-testing (TST can be followed by RT and back to TST multiple times)
- The optional labeling step (can be executed or skipped)
- All activities are connected in a single sequential path with no concurrency
