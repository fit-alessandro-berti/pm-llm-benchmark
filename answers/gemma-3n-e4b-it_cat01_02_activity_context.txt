**Justification of Naming Choices:**

*   **Request Submission:**  Replaces "Initiate Request" as it's the first step, explicitly indicating the beginning of the request process.
*   **Initial Document Verification:** Clarifies that the first document verification is the initial step after request submission.
*   **Document Verification Request:**  Distinguishes between the first verification (initial) and subsequent verifications. This helps differentiate when it’s a request for further documentation versus a re-check.
*   **Document Submission:** Clearly identifies when the customer uploads documents.
*   **Re-Verification:** Highlights that this verification happens *after* a document has been submitted.
*   **Request Approval:** More explicit than just "Approve Request."
*   **Identity Verification:**  Specifies the purpose of the verification in case there are other verification activities.
*   **Account Discrepancy Clarification:** Accurately describes the context of the "Call Customer" activity in C002, where the call is for clarifying an account issue.
*   **Account Adjustment:**  Indicates the purpose of this activity is to make changes to the account.
*   **Follow-up Account Adjustment:** Indicates that the call is to confirm the effectiveness of the account adjustment.
*   **Branch Visit:** Specifies that the activity occurs at the branch.
*   **Physical ID Verification:** Differentiates the identity verification performed by the branch officer from other verification methods.
*   **Customer Return Request:**  Describes that the call's intention is to ask a customer to return.
*   **Internal Correction:** Clearly indicates that the account adjustment is happening as an internal correction.



These renamed activities provide a more detailed and contextually relevant view of the support workflow, making it easier to understand the process flow and identify potential areas for improvement. They are also more easily searchable and analyzable for process optimization.
