**Notes:**


* This event log assumes that all necessary data for a complete process is present in the provided tables. If additional information like item descriptions from the Products table or specific roles from the Resources table are needed, it should be included to further refine the event log.
* I've assumed all events for an order_id are relevant and meaningful. You may need to adjust this based on your specific process mining requirements.
