**Step-by-Step Analysis**

1. **Comparing Total Resolution Times:**
   Let’s calculate the total resolution time for each case from the first event (“Receive Ticket”) to the last event (“Close Ticket”):

   - **Case 101:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:00 (Receive Ticket)
     - End: 2024-03-01 10:15 (Close Ticket)
     - Total Duration: Approximately **2 hours 15 minutes**

   - **Case 102:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
     - End: 2024-03-02 09:15
     - From March 1 at 08:05 to March 2 at 09:15 is roughly **25 hours and 10 minutes**

   - **Case 103:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
     - End: 2024-03-01 09:30
     - Total Duration: Approximately **1 hour 20 minutes**

   - **Case 104:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
     - End: 2024-03-02 08:30
     - Approximately **24 hours and 10 minutes**

   - **Case 105:**
     - Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
     - End: 2024-03-03 09:30
     - From March 1 at 08:25 to March 3 at 09:30 is about **49 hours and 5 minutes**

   **Summary of Duration:**
   - Shortest: Case 103 (~1h 20m), Case 101 (~2h 15m)
   - Longest: Case 105 (~49h), Case 102 (~25h), Case 104 (~24h)

   Clearly, **Cases 102, 104, and 105** take significantly longer than the others.

2. **Identifying Potential Root Causes:**

   **Escalations to Level-2 Support:**
   - Cases 102 and 105 both include an “Escalate to Level-2 Agent” activity.
   - After escalation, these tickets spend a much longer time before resolution. For example:
     - Case 102: Escalation at 11:30 on March 1; the issue is finally resolved at 09:00 on March 2.
     - Case 105: Escalation at 10:00 on March 1; the next investigative step by L2 only occurs at 14:00 on March 2, indicating a long queue or backlog.

   **Long Delays Between Key Steps:**
   - **Case 102:** Significant gap between “Investigate Issue” at 14:00 on March 1 and “Resolve Ticket” at 09:00 on March 2 (~19 hours).
   - **Case 104:** A long wait occurs between “Assign to Level-1 Agent” at 09:30 and “Investigate Issue” at 13:00, and then again a very long waiting period before “Resolve Ticket” the next day.
   - **Case 105:** Extremely long waiting periods are evident after escalation. The time from “Escalate to Level-2 Agent” (10:00 on March 1) until the next “Investigate Issue” step (14:00 on March 2) is about 28 hours. Another long wait occurs before “Resolve Ticket” on March 3.

   By contrast, the shorter-duration cases (101 and 103) move smoothly and sequentially through their steps with minimal waiting, no escalations, and prompt investigation and resolution.

3. **How These Factors Lead to Increased Cycle Times:**

   - **Escalation Delays:**  
     Tickets that require specialized knowledge or complex support (Level-2 Agents) face bottlenecks. If the Level-2 team is understaffed, overloaded, or has an inefficient queue management system, escalated tickets will sit idle for long periods, inflating resolution times.

   - **Resource Constraints at Investigation and Resolution Stages:**
     The large delays before the “Investigate Issue” or “Resolve Ticket” steps suggest that perhaps agents are juggling multiple tasks or the workload is unevenly distributed. This could result in tickets waiting in a queue until a resource becomes available to proceed.

   - **Process Inefficiencies:**
     Even if the process steps are logically ordered, delays may arise from:
     - Poor scheduling or prioritization of tasks.
     - Insufficient training or decision-making power at Level-1, causing unnecessary escalations.
     - Inadequate communication channels, causing “idle” waiting times.

4. **Insights and Recommendations:**

   **Addressing Escalation Bottlenecks:**
   - **Staffing and Resource Allocation:**  
     Increase the capacity or responsiveness of the Level-2 team. This could mean adding more skilled agents, implementing a shift system that ensures coverage during peak hours, or using intelligent workload distribution tools.
   
   - **Training and Empowerment of Level-1 Agents:**  
     Providing additional training or decision-making guidelines to Level-1 Agents may reduce the need for escalations. If fewer tickets require Level-2 intervention, the backlog and waiting times at the upper tier will decrease.
   
   **Reducing Wait Times Between Activities:**
   - **Process Automation and Notification Systems:**  
     Implement automated alerts or workflow triggers that immediately notify the responsible agent when a ticket is ready for the next action. Minimizing the manual “pull” model of picking up tickets can help expedite transitions.
   
   - **Better Performance Tracking and SLA Enforcement:**  
     Introduce Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for each step, especially escalations and investigations. Monitoring these KPIs can help identify when performance dips and corrective action is needed.
   
   - **Prioritization and Queue Management:**  
     Use priority-based queues so that escalated or complex tickets are not stuck behind lower-priority issues for extended periods. Dynamic re-prioritization based on ticket age, severity, or customer impact can ensure more balanced workloads.

**Conclusion:**
Long cycle times in Cases 102, 104, and 105 are predominantly due to escalations to higher-level support and long waiting periods before critical activities like investigation and resolution. By addressing these bottlenecks—through better resource management for Level-2 support, empowering Level-1 Agents, and implementing proactive workflow management—the process can achieve more consistent and timely ticket resolution.
