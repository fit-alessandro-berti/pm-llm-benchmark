Here's a complete and correct **DuckDB SQL query** that satisfies all requirements in your prompt:

---

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
  -- Step 1: Order events within each case by timestamp
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
  FROM event_log
),
-- Step 2: Build the full activity sequence per case as a string (e.g., "A->B->C")
sequence_as_string AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->') AS activity_sequence
  FROM ordered_activities
  GROUP BY case_id
),
-- Step 3: Count how many cases belong to each unique sequence
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count
  FROM sequence_as_string
  GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
-- Step 4: Rank variants by frequency and select top K
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY case_count DESC
  LIMIT K  -- Note: K must be provided as a parameter; here it's left as K for flexibility
),
-- Step 5: Filter original events to only those belonging to cases in top K variants
final_events AS (
  SELECT 
    el.*
  FROM event_log el
  JOIN (
    SELECT case_id 
    FROM sequence_as_string 
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
  ) filtered_cases ON el.case_id = filtered_cases.case_id
)
-- Final output: return all events from top K variants
SELECT *
FROM final_events;
```

###  Explanation of Key Components:

1. **`ordered_activities`**:
   - Assigns a row number within each `case_id` to maintain chronological order.
   - Ensures correct sequence of activities per case.

2. **`sequence_as_string`**:
   - Aggregates the ordered activities into a string like `"A->B->C"` using `STRING_AGG`.
   - This represents the **process variant** for each case.

3. **`variant_counts`**:
   - Counts how many cases belong to each unique process variant.

4. **`top_k_variants`**:
   - Orders variants by frequency and selects the top `K` most common ones.
   - `K` is a parameter (you must define it in your actual execution context, e.g., `K = 5`).

5. **`final_events`**:
   - Joins the original event log with the filtered cases (those in top K variants).
   - Returns only the events from cases that belong to top K variants.

---

###  Important Notes:

- **`K` must be specified** when running this query. For example, if you want the top 5 variants, replace `LIMIT K` with `LIMIT 5`.
- This query assumes that the process variant is fully defined by the **ordered sequence** of activities. It does **not** consider activity names or timing, only the order.
- DuckDB supports `STRING_AGG` and window functions, so this is valid syntax.
- The `STRING_AGG` uses `'->'` as a separator — you can adjust it if needed (e.g., for JSON or other formats).

### Example Usage (with K=5):

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
  FROM event_log
),
sequence_as_string AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->') AS activity_sequence
  FROM ordered_activities
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count
  FROM sequence_as_string
  GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY case_count DESC
  LIMIT 5
),
final_events AS (
  SELECT 
    el.*
  FROM event_log el
  JOIN (
    SELECT case_id 
    FROM sequence_as_string 
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
  ) filtered_cases ON el.case_id = filtered_cases.case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM final_events;
```

 This query satisfies all requirements:
- Extracts activity sequences by timestamp order.
- Groups by process variant.
- Counts variants and selects top K.
- Returns only events from cases in top K variants.

Let me know if you'd like a version that returns the variant sequences along with their counts or includes additional metadata (e.g., start/end timestamps).
