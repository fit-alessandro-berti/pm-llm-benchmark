### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

The temporal profile reveals several unusual timing patterns that deviate from what would be expected in a standard, well-controlled insurance claim handling process:

1. **Receive to Approve (R → P)**: Average of ~25 hours with an extremely low standard deviation (1 hour). This tight clustering suggests unusually rigid and predictable timing for approvals, which is atypical for a process involving human evaluation.

2. **Approve to Notify (P → N)**: Average of 7 days with a high standard deviation (2 days). This indicates a significant and highly variable delay between approval and customer notification, which is unexpected as notification should typically follow approval promptly.

3. **Assign to Close (A → C)**: Average of only 2 hours. Completing the entire process from assignment to closure in such a short time raises concerns that intermediate steps (Evaluate, Approve) may be bypassed or not properly executed.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (E → N)**: Average of just 5 minutes with a very low standard deviation (1 minute). This near-instantaneous transition is suspiciously fast for activities that typically involve review, decision-making, and communication preparation.

### Hypotheses for These Anomalies

1. **R → P low variation and ~25-hour average**:
   - Possible automated or scripted approval process for certain claim categories, potentially bypassing thorough review.
   - Batch processing of approvals occurring at fixed times (e.g., once per day), creating artificial regularity.
   - Data entry practices where timestamps are backdated or standardized to meet internal KPIs.

2. **P → N long and variable delay**:
   - Backlog in the notification department or system, or dependency on external parties (e.g., payment processing) before notification.
   - Manual notification steps that are deprioritized, leading to inconsistent execution.
   - Resource constraints or workload imbalances causing notifications to be batched or delayed irregularly.

3. **A → C very short duration**:
   - Certain claims (e.g., low-value or straightforward) being fast-tracked or automatically closed without full evaluation.
   - Premature closure of invalid or duplicate claims shortly after assignment.
   - Possible error or fraud pattern where claims are assigned and immediately closed to manipulate performance metrics.

4. **E → N near-instant transition**:
   - Automated notification triggered immediately upon evaluation completion, potentially without required supervisory approval or documentation.
   - Timestamp inaccuracies where evaluation and notification are recorded simultaneously in a single system action.
   - Skipping of intermediate approval step in some process variants, with notification occurring directly after evaluation.

### Proposed Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

Below are targeted SQL queries to investigate the identified anomalies:

1. **Claims approved with unusually consistent timing from receipt (R → P low STDEV)**  
   Investigate if approvals cluster around specific times of day or are tied to certain adjusters/types.

   ```sql
   WITH times AS (
       SELECT 
           ce.claim_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS receive_ts,
           MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_ts,
           EXTRACT(HOUR FROM MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END)) AS approve_hour
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.activity IN ('R', 'P')
       GROUP BY ce.claim_id
       HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
   )
   SELECT 
       approve_hour,
       COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
       AVG(approve_ts - receive_ts) AS avg_interval,
       STDDEV(approve_ts - receive_ts) AS stdev_interval
   FROM times
   GROUP BY approve_hour
   ORDER BY claim_count DESC;
   ```

2. **Claims with excessively long delays between Approve and Notify (P → N)**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       ce.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       c.claim_amount,
       (notify_ts - approve_ts) AS delay_interval
   FROM (
       SELECT 
           claim_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_ts,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_ts
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
       GROUP BY claim_id
       HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2
   ) ce
   JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE (notify_ts - approve_ts) > INTERVAL '3 days'  -- Focus on outliers
   ORDER BY delay_interval DESC
   LIMIT 50;
   ```

3. **Claims closed very quickly after assignment (A → C short duration)**  
   Check if intermediate steps are missing.

   ```sql
   WITH fast_close AS (
       SELECT 
           ce.claim_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS assign_ts,
           MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS close_ts
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')
       GROUP BY ce.claim_id
       HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
         AND MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
             MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) < INTERVAL '4 hours'
   )
   SELECT 
       fc.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       c.claim_amount,
       STRING_AGG(ce.activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS activity_sequence
   FROM fast_close fc
   JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = fc.claim_id
   JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = fc.claim_id
   GROUP BY fc.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
   ORDER BY (close_ts - assign_ts);
   ```

4. **Near-instant Evaluate to Notify transitions (E → N very fast)**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       ce.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       ce.resource,
       (notify_ts - eval_ts) AS transition_time
   FROM (
       SELECT 
           claim_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS eval_ts,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_ts
       FROM claim_events
       WHERE activity IN ('E', 'N')
       GROUP BY claim_id
       HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2
   ) ce
   JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE (notify_ts - eval_ts) < INTERVAL '15 minutes'
   ORDER BY transition_time;
   ```

These queries can help isolate specific claims, resources, or patterns for deeper investigation into process compliance, potential automation misuse, or operational bottlenecks.
