Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects can have both benefits and challenges. Here are some of the main advantages and disadvantages to consider:

**Benefits:**

1. **Improved visibility and understanding**: Decomposition can help identify complex process flows, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies, leading to a deeper understanding of the process and identifying opportunities for improvement.
2. **Streamlined process execution**: Decomposition can aid in the design and optimization of process workflows, leading to improved efficiency and reduced cycle times.
3. **Enhanced data quality**: By identifying errors and inconsistencies in the data, decomposition can help improve data quality and reduce errors in process execution.
4. **Better decision-making**: By analyzing process behavior and identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), decomposition can inform business decisions and drive process optimization.
5. **Cost savings**: Decomposition can help identify areas of waste and inefficiency, leading to cost savings and improved profitability.

**Challenges:**

1. **Complexity**: Large-scale process mining projects involve complex data sets, process flows, and organizational structures, making it difficult to decompose processes.
2. **Data quality issues**: Poor data quality can hinder decomposition efforts, making it challenging to identify accurate and relevant process information.
3. **Limited domain expertise**: Decomposition may require specialized knowledge and expertise, which may not be readily available in large-scale projects.
4. **Balancing decomposition and abstraction**: Over-decomposition can lead to an excessive focus on details, while under-decomposition can result in missed opportunities for optimization.
5. **Integration with existing systems**: Large-scale projects may involve integrating new process mining tools or systems with existing ones, which can be challenging.
6. **Data analysis and interpretation**: Decomposition analysis requires careful data analysis and interpretation, which can be time-consuming and require expertise.
7. **Change management**: Decomposition may require significant changes to organizational processes and workflows, which can be challenging to implement and manage.

**Best practices to overcome these challenges:**

1. **Invest in data preparation and cleaning**: Ensure accurate and consistent data quality to support decomposition efforts.
2. **Develop a clear decomposition strategy**: Define a clear approach to decomposition, including key metrics and goals.
3. **Choose the right decomposition methods**: Select decomposition methods that are suitable for your project's complexity and data characteristics.
4. **Use data visualization tools**: Leverage data visualization tools to facilitate effective analysis and interpretation of process data.
5. **Collaborate with domain experts**: Involve domain experts in the decomposition process to ensure that analysis and recommendations are relevant and accurate.
6. **Test and validate results**: Validate decomposition findings through testing and simulation to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.

By being aware of the benefits and challenges of applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects, you can develop effective approaches to overcome these challenges and achieve successful results.
