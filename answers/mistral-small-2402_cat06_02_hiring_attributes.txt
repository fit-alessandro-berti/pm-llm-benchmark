In this event log, the sensitive attributes for fairness are "case:citizen", "case:gender", "case:german speaking", and "case:religious". These attributes are considered sensitive because they are related to personal characteristics that should not be used to discriminate against individuals in the hiring process. For example, a company should not reject job applications solely based on someone's citizenship, gender, language skills, or religious beliefs. Therefore, it is important to analyze the event log to ensure that there is no bias or unfair treatment based on these sensitive attributes.
