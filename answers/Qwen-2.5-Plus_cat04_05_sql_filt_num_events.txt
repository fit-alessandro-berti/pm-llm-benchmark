```sql
-- First, ensure the DuckDB environment is set up correctly and the table `event_log` exists with proper data.

-- This SQL query solves the defined task in the prompt:
WITH CaseEventCounts AS (
    -- Count the number of events per case_id.
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
    -- Filter to only include cases with six or fewer events.
    HAVING 
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)
-- Select all columns for events belonging to the cases identified above.
SELECT 
    e.*
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    CaseEventCounts c 
ON 
    e.case_id = c.case_id;
```

**Explanation:**
1. The solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `CaseEventCounts` to first determine the count of events (`event_count`) for each `case_id`.
2. Within this CTE, the `HAVING` clause ensures that only those `case_id`s with an `event_count` of six or fewer are included.
3. The main query then selects all columns from the original `event_log` table (`e.*`), joining it with the filtered list of `case_id`s from the CTE on the `case_id` field.
4. As a result, only the events from cases with six or fewer total events are returned by the query.
