Based on an analysis of the two POWL models provided, here is the identification of their anomalies and a determination of which model more closely aligns with the normative "Hire-to-Retire" process.

### 1. Analysis of POWL Model 1

**Structure:**
Model 1 uses a `StrictPartialOrder` to define dependencies. The core sequence follows:
`Post_Job_Ad` $\rightarrow$ `Screen_Candidates` $\rightarrow$ (`Make_Hiring_Decision` OR `Conduct_Interviews`) $\rightarrow$ `Onboard_Employee` $\rightarrow$ `Add_to_Payroll` $\rightarrow$ `Close_Case`.

**Identified Anomalies:**
*   **Missing Dependency between Interview and Decision:** There is no edge between `Conduct_Interviews` and `Make_Hiring_Decision`. In Model 1, both activities only depend on `Screen_Candidates`. This means the model allows a user to "Make a Hiring Decision" **before** or **simultaneously** with "Conducting Interviews." In a normative process, an interview is a prerequisite for a hiring decision.
*   **Parallel Interviewing:** Because there is no outgoing edge from `Conduct_Interviews` to any subsequent step, the interview is treated as a side-task that must happen after screening but doesn't necessarily have to finish before onboarding begins.

### 2. Analysis of POWL Model 2

**Structure:**
Model 2 uses a combination of `StrictPartialOrder`, `LOOP`, and `XOR` operators.
`Post_Job_Ad` $\rightarrow$ (`Screen_Candidates` AND `Conduct_Interviews` in parallel) $\rightarrow$ `Make_Hiring_Decision` $\rightarrow$ `Onboard_Loop` $\rightarrow$ `Payroll_XOR` $\rightarrow$ `Close_Case`.

**Identified Anomalies:**
*   **Screening and Interviewing in Parallel:** The model lacks an edge between `Screen_Candidates` and `Conduct_Interviews`. This implies that a candidate can be interviewed before they have been screened, which contradicts the standard funnel of recruitment.
*   **Optional Payroll (Critical Anomaly):** The `xor_payroll` operator (`XOR` between `Add_to_Payroll` and `SilentTransition`) allows the process to bypass the payroll system entirely. In a "Hire-to-Retire" process, skipping the payroll step for a hired employee is a fundamental failure of process integrity and legal compliance.
*   **Repetitive Onboarding:** The `loop_onboarding` allows the `Onboard_Employee` activity to be repeated indefinitely. While less severe than skipping payroll, it is an unusual requirement for a normative model unless the process specifically accounts for onboarding failures.

### 3. Comparison and Conclusion

| Feature | Model 1 | Model 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recruitment Logic** | Screening must happen first, but Decision/Interview order is flawed. | Screening and Interviewing can happen in any order (Flawed). |
| **Administrative Logic** | Strict linear sequence: Decision $\rightarrow$ Onboard $\rightarrow$ Payroll $\rightarrow$ Close. | Payroll can be skipped entirely (Major Flaw). |
| **Process Integrity** | Higher; ensures every hire is added to payroll. | Lower; allows "ghost" employees (Onboarded but not on payroll). |

#### **Final Decision: Model 1 is more normative.**

**Justification:**
While both models contain logical errors regarding the sequence of interviews and decisions, **Model 1 is significantly more robust.** 

Model 1 maintains the **integrity of the administrative chain**. It correctly enforces that once a hiring decision is made, the employee is onboarded, added to the payroll, and finally, the case is closed. Every person hired in Model 1 will be paid.

**Model 2 contains a critical process violation:** the ability to skip the `Add_to_Payroll` step. In any organizational context, the "Hire-to-Retire" process must ensure that a hired and onboarded employee is registered for payment. Furthermore, Model 2 allows interviews to occur before screening, which is a less efficient and non-standard recruitment practice compared to Model 1, where screening is at least established as a prerequisite for both interviewing and deciding.
