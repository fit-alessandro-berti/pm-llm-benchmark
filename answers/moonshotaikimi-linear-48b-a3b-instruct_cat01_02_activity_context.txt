Key points and justifications  
1. “Initiate Request” is ambiguous; we replace it with concrete first-gate phrases (Received-at-Portal/branch, Connected-Initiative-Submitted).  
2. The first “Call Customer” is consistently a request to supply missing documents; each case therefore gets “*Request-ID-to-Customer (via-call)*”.  
3. The second “Call Customer” always serves to confirm an adjustment already made; we label it “*Confirm-Adjustments (via-follow-up-call)*”.  
4. “Verify Documents” occurs before and after an update; we distinguish the first-time check from the re-check, e.g., “*Verify-ID-Scan*” vs. “*Re-Verify-ID*”.  
5. Each final “Approve Request” is the happy-path, successful completion; we unify them under “Approve-Request (Successfully-Completed)” to make the successful outcome explicit.
