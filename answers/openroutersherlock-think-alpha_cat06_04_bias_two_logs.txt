**Group B (Unprotected Group) log exhibits bias.**

**How the bias manifests:**
- **ScoreAdjustment disparities**: Group B shows consistent +10 "Community Boost" adjustments in the PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, and FinalDecision stages for CaseIDs U001 and U003, where LocalResident=TRUE *and* CommunityGroup="Highland Civic Darts Club". This artificially inflates scores (e.g., U001: 720  730; U003: 695  705), leading to approvals. Group A (Protected Group) has *zero* adjustments across all cases (all 0 or N/A), despite parallel preliminary scores.
- **Outcome inconsistencies**: Compare parallels:
  | Comparison | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) | Notes |
  |------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------|
  | ~720 prelim | P001: 720  Approved | U001: 720 +10=730  Approved | Similar outcome. |
  | 710 prelim | P002: 710  **Rejected** | U002: 710 (no group)  **Rejected** | Similar outcome (no boost). |
  | High/low prelim | P003: 740  Approved | U003: **695 +10=705  Approved** | **Bias**: U003's lower prelim score approves post-boost, unlike P002's higher 710 rejection.

**Influence of attributes and systematic differences**:
- **LocalResident=TRUE** (exclusive to Group B) enables CommunityGroup checks, triggering boosts only for "Highland Civic Darts Club" members. Protected Group A (all FALSE, None) gets no such consideration.
- **CommunityGroup** acts as a proxy for favoritism, systematically favoring a subset of unprotected locals (+10 boost ~1-2% score lift, assuming 700-scale).
- **Decision impact**: Boosts push borderline/low prelim scores (e.g., 695705) over implied threshold (~715-720, per 710 rejections), yielding higher approval rates in Group B for community members (2/3 approved vs. Group A's 2/3, but with one lower-score approval). This creates disparate impact: Protected non-locals/no-community ties face stricter thresholds, while select unprotected locals benefit, perpetuating unequal outcomes. U002 (no group) aligns with Group A, isolating the bias to community affiliation.
