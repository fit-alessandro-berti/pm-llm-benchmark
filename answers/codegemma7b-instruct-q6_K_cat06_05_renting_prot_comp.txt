## Main Differences between the Process Variants

**1. Screening:**

* **Extensive Screening:** Takes more time than standard screening but provides more detailed information about the tenant.
* **Reject Prospective Tenant:** No screening is conducted and the tenant is automatically denied.

**2. Payment Frequency:**

* **Pay Rent:** Rent is paid monthly.
* **Pay Rent:** Rent is paid quarterly.
* **Pay Rent:** Rent is paid annually.

**3. Lease Duration:**

* **Tenant Cancels Appartment:** Lease ends immediately.
* **Tenant Cancels Appartment:** Tenant gives notice and leaves at the end of the lease term.

**4. Rent Payment:**

* **Pay Rent:** Rent is paid on time.
* **Miss Rent Payment:** Rent is missed and no warning is issued.
* **Issue Warning:** Rent is missed and a warning is issued.
* **Evict Tenant:** Rent is missed and the tenant is evicted.

**5. Lease Terms:**

* **Sign Contract:** Tenant signs the lease agreement.
* **Move In:** Tenant moves into the apartment.

**Additional Notes:**

* The data suggests that extensive screening results in higher frequency and performance than standard screening.
* Missing rent payments and issuing warnings both lead to eviction, while timely rent payments are successful.
* Shorter lease durations (tenant cancels sooner) generally have higher performance than longer durations.

**Overall:**

The data shows that the process for securing an apartment varies depending on various factors, including screening methods, lease terms, and rent payment practices. It's important to analyze the specific data for each apartment and tenant to determine the best course of action.
