Got it  — you want me to create a **realistic temporal profile** for a **global supply chain process** where activity pairs are not always consecutive, but may be separated by multiple intermediate steps.

The **temporal profile** will be a Python dictionary:
- **Key**: a tuple of two activity labels `(Activity1, Activity2)`, where Activity2 happens after Activity1 in at least one execution.
- **Value**: a tuple `(average_time_in_seconds, standard_deviation_in_seconds)`.
- I will **estimate plausible times** based on real-world supply chain operations.
- I’ll include **both directly and indirectly related** pairs to show complexity.

### My Assumptions for Estimation

1. **Supplier Selection  Order Placement** — relatively short, internal coordination, typically hours to a day.
2. **Supplier Selection  Receive Components** — can take weeks due to procurement and shipping.
3. **Receive Components  Quality Inspection** — short lead time once goods arrive.
4. **Assembly  Testing  Packaging** — manufacturing workflow steps with hours to days.
5. **Distribution** — depends on logistics network, possibly days.
6. **Indirect pairs** — e.g., *Supplier Selection  Distribution*, where the time includes entire procurement, manufacturing, and logistics phases.

### Temporal Profile Dictionary

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Procurement phase
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 7200),           # ~1 day avg, 2h std dev
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1728000, 172800),       # ~20 days avg, 2 days std dev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1555200, 172800),       # ~18 days avg, 2 days std dev
    
    # Incoming goods processing
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 3600),           # ~4 hours avg, 1h std dev
    ('RC', 'CA'): (28800, 7200),           # ~8 hours avg, 2h std dev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 3600),           # ~4 hours avg, 1h std dev

    # Assembly and production
    ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 86400),         # ~2 days avg, 1 day std dev
    ('CA', 'PK'): (259200, 86400),         # ~3 days avg, 1 day std dev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 21600),          # ~1 day avg, 6h std dev

    # Logistics
    ('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 3600),           # ~4 hours avg, 1h std dev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),         # ~3 days avg, 1 day std dev

    # After Sales
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800),        # ~7 days avg, 2 days std dev

    # Cross-phase, non-consecutive pairs
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1814400, 172800),       # ~21 days avg, 2 days std dev
    ('OP', 'PT'): (1900800, 172800),       # ~22 days avg, 2 days std dev
    ('QI', 'PK'): (345600, 86400),         # ~4 days avg, 1 day std dev
    ('RC', 'DT'): (518400, 172800),        # ~6 days avg, 2 days std dev
    ('SS', 'DT'): (2332800, 259200),       # ~27 days avg, 3 days std dev
    ('CA', 'AS'): (1296000, 172800),       # ~15 days avg, 2 days std dev
}
```

### Notes:
- **Times are in seconds** (`days * 86400`).
- The dictionary includes **direct process steps** plus **eventually-following pairs**.
- Values are **hypothetical but plausible** for a large-scale electronics manufacturing supply chain.
- Such a profile could be used to **detect deviations** using your `ZETA` threshold formula.

If you’d like, I can also **generate the *full* Cartesian subset** of all eventually-following pairs from this process flow with random-but-realistic averages and deviations so it’s ready for automatic deviation detection.  

Do you want me to expand this into **the complete temporal profile for all activity pairs**?
