Based on the given information about packages sent through various processes, here are some potential root causes:

1. **Incorrect Package ID:** This could be a common cause as it may involve errors with package IDs or order numbers being processed incorrectly.

2. **Processing Error:** There's also a chance that there might have been processing errors in the packages due to incorrect delivery dates, quantities, or tracking information.

3. **Incorrect Delivery Address:** The package delivery address might not match what is being sent or it could be incorrectly entered if there were issues with entering addresses on the order.

4. **Incorrect Tracking Information:** This can arise when there are issues with tracking errors or tracking numbers missing from the order. 

5. **Software Issues:** If any of these packages have software bugs or glitches, they might not perform properly during delivery or tracking processes leading to performance issues.

6. **User Error:** Errors in inputting package information could lead to incorrect processing.

7. **System Overheating:** An issue with the hardware systems where packages are sent might also contribute to performance issues.

8. **Hardware Limitations:** Sometimes, specific hardware settings within the delivery and tracking software can affect the speed of delivery.

9. **Network Connection Issues:** A connection problem or network latency could cause delays in delivery, particularly if this affects the package's location.

10. **User Behavior:** Human error while handling packages might also lead to performance issues like errors when ordering or picking up items incorrectly.

Please note that these are broad and general considerations based on the given sample data. For specific solutions or more targeted advice, it would be advisable to consult a software developer or a hardware engineer for detailed troubleshooting steps and solutions.
