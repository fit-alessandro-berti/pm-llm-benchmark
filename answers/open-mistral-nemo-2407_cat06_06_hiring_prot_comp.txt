Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. **Initial Point of Contact:**
   - Protected Group: More patients initially register at the Emergency Room (ER) than the First Aid Department (FD) (284 vs 269).
   - Unprotected Group: More patients initially register at the First Aid Department (FD) than the Emergency Room (ER) (1466 vs 1418).

2. **Expert Examination:**
   - Protected Group: Expert Examination is more frequently used as the initial step (179 + 174 + 78 + 54 + 51 + 22 + 102 + 40 + 16 + 9 = 683).
   - Unprotected Group: Expert Examination is also frequently used, but not as much as in the protected group (1466 + 1418 + 653 + 592 + 225 + 102 + 88 + 35 + 15 + 9 = 4792).

3. **Thorough Examination:**
   - Protected Group: Thorough Examination is more frequently used after the initial registration (130 + 112 + 46 + 40 + 37 + 25 + 20 + 19 = 429).
   - Unprotected Group: Thorough Examination is used less frequently after the initial registration (656 + 604 + 192 + 100 + 97 + 29 = 1678).

4. **Treatment Success:**
   - Protected Group: There are more instances where treatment is unsuccessful and requires additional diagnosis and treatment (48 + 40 + 22 + 19 + 16 + 9 = 144).
   - Unprotected Group: There are also instances where treatment is unsuccessful, but more frequently in the protected group (225 + 190 + 102 + 88 + 35 + 15 + 9 = 734).

5. **Discharge:**
   - Protected Group: There are more instances where patients are discharged without any treatment (158 + 156 + 83 + 80 + 67 + 51 + 29 + 24 + 19 = 637).
   - Unprotected Group: There are fewer instances where patients are discharged without any treatment (505).

6. **Performance:**
   - Protected Group: The performance metrics vary widely, with some processes having very high performance (e.g., 320020.038) and others very low (e.g., 0.000).
   - Unprotected Group: The performance metrics also vary widely, but there are more instances of high performance (e.g., 320004.432, 319999.055, 320002.980).

These differences suggest that the protected group may have more complex cases that require expert examination and thorough examination, leading to more instances of treatment failure and the need for additional diagnosis and treatment. The unprotected group, on the other hand, may have more straightforward cases that can be handled with standard examination and treatment. However, the protected group also has a higher number of patients discharged without any treatment, which could indicate inefficiencies in the process. The performance metrics also vary widely in both groups, suggesting that there may be opportunities for improvement in both.
