To generate a temporal profile for this process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities for all process variants. Let's break this down into manageable steps:

1. **Identify all unique activities** in the process.
2. **Construct the process traces** from the given variants.
3. **Calculate the time intervals between activities** for each trace.
4. **Compute the average and standard deviation** for each pair of activities.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

First, let's list the unique activities:

- Create Fine
- Send Fine
- Insert Fine Notification
- Add penalty
- Payment
- Payment (Repeat)
- Send for Credit Collection
- Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture
- Appeal to Judge
- Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture
- Notify Result Appeal to Offender

### Example Calculations

To demonstrate, we will calculate the average and standard deviation for a few example pairs of activities.

#### Example Pairs
1. (Create Fine, Send Fine)
2. (Create Fine, Insert Fine Notification)
3. (Create Fine, Payment)

### Sample Trace and Calculations

Let's assume we have the following traces for demonstration:

1. Create Fine -> Send Fine (frequency: 1, performance: 1 day) -> Insert Fine Notification (frequency: 2, performance: 1.5 days) -> Add penalty (frequency: 3, performance: 1.5 days) -> Payment (frequency: 4, performance: 2 days)
2. Create Fine -> Send Fine (frequency: 1, performance: 1 day) -> Insert Fine Notification (frequency: 2, performance: 1.5 days) -> Payment (frequency: 4, performance: 2 days)
3. Create Fine -> Send Fine (frequency: 1, performance: 1 day) -> Insert Fine Notification (frequency: 2, performance: 1.5 days) -> Add penalty (frequency: 3, performance: 1.5 days) -> Send for Credit Collection (frequency: 4, performance: 3 days)

#### Pair: (Create Fine, Send Fine)

Traces:
- 1 day (from trace 1)
- 1 day (from trace 2)
- 1 day (from trace 3)

Average time = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1 day

#### Pair: (Create Fine, Insert Fine Notification)

Traces:
- 1.5 days (from trace 1)
- 1.5 days (from trace 2)
- 1.5 days (from trace 3)

Average time = (1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5) / 3 = 1.5 days

#### Pair: (Create Fine, Payment)

Traces:
- 2 days (from trace 1)
- 2 days (from trace 2)
- 2 days (from trace 3)

Average time = (2 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 2 days

### Full Calculation

We would need to repeat these calculations for all pairs of activities and for all provided traces. This could be automated with a script to process the input data and compute the necessary statistics.

### Python Script

Here is a simplified Python script to automate the calculation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import numpy as np

# Example input data
variants = [
    ["Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty", "Payment"],
    ["Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Payment"],
    # ... (other traces)
]

# Extract unique activities
activities = set()
for variant in variants:
    for activity in variant:
        activities.add(activity)

# Dictionary to hold the average and std dev of time intervals
temporal_profile = defaultdict(lambda: (0, 0))

# Process each variant
for variant in variants:
    prev_end_time = 0
    for i in range(len(variant) - 1):
        activity_pair = (variant[i], variant[i+1])
        time_between = variant[i+1] - variant[i]
        temporal_profile[activity_pair] = (
            temporal_profile[activity_pair][0] + time_between, 
            temporal_profile[activity_pair][1] + 1
        )

# Compute average and standard deviation
for activity_pair, (total_time, count) in temporal_profile.items():
    avg_time = total_time / count
    std_dev = np.sqrt((sum((t - avg_time)**2 for t in total_time) / count))
    temporal_profile[activity_pair] = (avg_time, std_dev)

print(temporal_profile)
```

This script processes the input data and computes the average and standard deviation for each pair of activities. You would need to adjust it to handle the specific data format and performance values provided in your input.
