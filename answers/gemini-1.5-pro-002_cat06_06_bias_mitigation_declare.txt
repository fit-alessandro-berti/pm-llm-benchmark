**Explanation of Bias Mitigation:**

The added constraints aim to reduce potential bias in the loan application process by enforcing checks and balances, particularly when dealing with sensitive applicant attributes:

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**  The coexistence constraints mandate that if a decision (Approve or Reject) is made for an applicant from a minority group or a female applicant, a `ManualReview` activity *must* also occur within the same trace.  This ensures additional oversight and reduces the likelihood of biased decisions based solely on sensitive attributes.

2. **Response Constraints:**  The response constraints involving `CheckApplicantRace` and `CheckApplicantGender` ensure that if these checks occur, a `BiasMitigationCheck` *must* follow.  This forces the process to explicitly address potential bias arising from these sensitive attributes before any decision is taken.

3. **Succession Constraints:** These constraints stipulate that `Approve` or `Reject` decisions can only occur *after* a `BiasMitigationCheck` if the sensitive attributes were checked previously. This enforces a structured process flow, preventing immediate decisions based on sensitive attributes without appropriate mitigation steps.


4. **Non-succession Constraints:** These constraints prohibit a direct succession from checking a sensitive attribute (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`) to a `Reject` decision.  This prevents an immediate, potentially biased, rejection based solely on the sensitive attribute without any intervening checks or mitigating actions.


These combined constraints create a process where decisions involving sensitive attributes are more carefully considered and reviewed, reducing the risk of unfair or biased outcomes.  The `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` act as safeguards to ensure fairness and consistency.
