To create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining from the given tables, we'll follow these steps:
1. Identify `order_id` as the case identifier.
2. Derive activities based on key events in each order lifecycle.
3. Map timestamps to each derived activity accurately.
4. Combine data linking each event using relevant keys and ensuring chronological correctness.
5. Enrich with resources and attributes if available.

### Final Event Log

**Notes on Assumptions and Missing Data**:  
For orders `1004`, the dispatch and arrival dates were not provided in the delivery table, leading to placeholders for these events. Additionally, while every effort was made to accurately map resources based on given IDs, some activities did not specify a responsible party, resulting in blanks where relevant.

The final event log reflects all key lifecycle stages of each order from creation through dispatch and invoice/payment processing. Ensuring the sequence respects the real-world process flow aids in accurate process mining analysis.
