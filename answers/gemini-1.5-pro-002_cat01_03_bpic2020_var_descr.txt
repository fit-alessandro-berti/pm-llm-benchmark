The process describes the lifecycle of a Declaration submitted by an Employee, which ultimately aims for payment handling.  There are several approval steps, and the process includes rejection loops, leading to rework.  Here's a breakdown:

**Core Process:**

* **Submission:** The Employee SUBMITS a Declaration.
* **Approval Layers:**  Several actors can be involved in the approval process:
    * **Administration:**  A common approval step.
    * **Supervisor:** Final approval authority in most cases.
    * **Budget Owner:** Approves budget allocation for the declaration.
    * **Pre-Approver:** An initial approval stage in some variants.
* **Payment:** Once FINAL_APPROVED by the Supervisor, a payment is requested and subsequently handled.

**Rejection Loops and Rework:**

Rejections can occur at various stages, creating loops back to earlier steps:

* **Employee Rejection:** If the Declaration is REJECTED by Administration, Supervisor, Budget Owner, or Pre-approver, the Employee can REJECT the rejection and resubmit a revised Declaration. This can happen multiple times.
* **Missing Information Rejection:** A "MISSING" rejection occurs after Supervisor approval, suggesting missing information. The Declaration is then resubmitted and goes through Supervisor approval again.

**Process Variants:**

The data shows several variations in the approval flow:

1. **Standard Flow (most frequent):**  Employee -> Administration -> Supervisor -> Payment
2. **Budget Approval:** Employee -> Administration -> Budget Owner -> Supervisor -> Payment
3. **Direct Supervisor Approval:** Employee -> Supervisor -> Payment
4. **Pre-Approval:** Employee -> Pre-Approver -> Supervisor -> Payment

The remaining variants primarily represent different combinations of rejections and resubmissions within the approval stages outlined above.  The frequency data indicates that the standard flow and the budget approval flow are the most common.

**"SAVED" State:**

The "SAVED by EMPLOYEE" state suggests that employees can save a draft of the declaration before submitting it.  The zero performance time indicates that this is just a saving action and not part of the active process flow towards payment.

**Key Observations:**

* **Rejection Handling:**  The rejection loops add significant time to the process, especially when multiple rejections occur. The performance data shows significantly longer times for variants with multiple rejections.
* **Bottlenecks:** Analysis of the frequency and performance data could pinpoint bottlenecks in the process. For instance, are rejections at a specific stage particularly frequent, suggesting a problem with that stage?
* **Process Improvement:** This data provides opportunities to analyze the reasons for rejections and potentially streamline the process to reduce rework and improve overall performance.


By understanding the process flow and its variations, as well as the impact of rejections, opportunities for process optimization and improvement can be identified.
