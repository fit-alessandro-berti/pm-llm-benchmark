Here is the structure of the **process tree** that captures the observed behavior in the event log:

```
-> (
    'RA',  # Receive Application (initial activity)
    * (   # Loop to handle missing information (optional repetition)
        -> (
            'VF',  # Validate Form
            X (    # Exclusive choice to either assess eligibility or request missing info
                'AE',  # Assess Eligibility
                'RMI'  # Request Missing Info
            )
        ),
        tau  # Silent step, allowing exit from the loop
    ),
    -> (   # Sequence of the remaining mandatory steps
        'AD',  # Approval Decision
        'SC',  # Send Confirmation
        'AC'   # Archive Case (final activity)
    )
)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Step:**
   - The process always starts with `'RA'` (Receive Application), which directly flows into the loop.

2. **Loop for Missing Information:**
   - A loop (`*`) begins, which repeatedly handles validation and processing of missing information.
   - Inside this loop:
     - The sequence (`->`) first performs `'VF'` (Validate Form).
     - After form validation, we observe an **exclusive choice (`X`)**: either `'AE'` (Assess Eligibility) is performed directly, or `'RMI'` (Request Missing Info) is triggered, which may loop back into validation (`'VF'`).
   - The loop repeats until the process exits through the silent step (`tau`).

3. **Final Mandatory Sequence:**
   - Once the loop is exited, the remaining mandatory steps occur in a strict sequence (`->`):
     - `'AD'` (Approval Decision),
     - `'SC'` (Send Confirmation), and
     - `'AC'` (Archive Case) as the final activity.

### Behavior Captured:
- **Main Flow:** `RA -> VF -> AE -> AD -> SC -> AC` (normal cases without missing information).
- **Repetition/Looping:** Captures the repetition of `'RMI'` (Request Missing Info) and subsequent re-validation (`VF`) until exiting the loop.
- **Optional Paths:** The choice between assessing eligibility (`'AE'`) or requesting missing information (`'RMI'`) based on the process need during the loop.
- **Sequencing:** Ensures required steps like `'AD'`, `'SC'`, and `'AC'` always occur at the end in sequence.

This process tree balances fitness, precision, and simplicity while reflecting the structure of the observed behaviors in the event log.
