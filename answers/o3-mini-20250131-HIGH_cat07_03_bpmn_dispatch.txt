It’s a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram** that illustrates how an order moves through a shipping and logistics process. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements:

1. **Swimlanes (the horizontal bands):**  
   - The top lane represents the **Logistics** department’s responsibilities.  
   - The bottom lane represents the **Warehouse** department’s responsibilities.  

2. **Start and Flow of the Process:**  
   - The process begins with gathering **order details** (in the Logistics lane).  
   - A check is made to see if **resources** are available or if **special handling** is required.  
   - If a delay or special requirement arises, the process may branch to **notify the customer** about any issues.

3. **Decision Gateways (diamonds):**  
   - **Exclusive gateways** (marked with an “X” or a simple diamond) route the flow to one branch or another (e.g., “Special handling?”).  
   - **Parallel gateways** (often marked with a plus “+”) split the process into multiple simultaneous paths or merge parallel tasks back together.

4. **Key Tasks:**  
   - **Get 3 offers from shipping companies** and **select a logistics company**: indicates a step where the best shipping option is determined.  
   - **Write package label** and decide if it’s a **house parcel** or another shipping type.  
   - **Package goods** in the Warehouse lane.  
   - **Fill out shipment paperwork** and **move package to pickup area** to prepare it for the shipping carrier.

5. **End of the Process:**  
   - Once the package is fully prepared (labeled, packaged, and paperwork is done), the **shipment is ready** and eventually handed off to the carrier in the **Ship goods** task.

Overall, this BPMN diagram shows a structured workflow of how a product order is processed—from initial checks and labeling in Logistics to the actual packing and final shipment in the Warehouse. It also highlights points where the customer might be notified (e.g., if there is a delay) and how the choice of shipping company is determined.
