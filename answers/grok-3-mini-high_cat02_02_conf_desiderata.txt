First, I am considering the normative rules from Part 1. These are strict and must be followed. The sequence is:

- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case

Key ordering rules:

- Credit Check before Risk Assessment

- Risk Assessment before Loan Decision

- Inform Applicant after Loan Decision

- If approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case

- If rejected, no Finalize Documentation

What's not allowed:

- Skipping steps

- Changing order

- Finalizing documentation after rejection

- Closing case without proper logic

Now, desiderata from Part 2 are recommended but not strict:

- Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received

- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision

- Perform a Follow-up Call before closing the case (not mentioned in the log, so I need to check if it's done or not)

Event log has three cases: Case 1, Case 2, Case 3.

I need to:

1. Identify normative violations and explain.

2. Identify desiderata failures and note they're not severe.

3. Suggest interpretations or justifications where possible.

Let's analyze each case step by step.

**Case 1:**

- 2024-01-10 09:00: Application Received

- 09:30: Credit Check

- 10:00: Risk Assessment

- 11:00: Loan Decision (Approved)

- 13:00: Inform Applicant

- 13:30: Finalize Documentation

- 14:00: Close Case

Sequence: Starts with App Received, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision, Inform Applicant, Finalize Doc (since approved), Close Case. Order is correct.

No skipping, no wrong order. Decision is approved, so Finalize Doc before Close Case is done.

Normative: No violations.

Desiderata:

- Credit Check within 24 hours: Received at 09:00, Check at 09:30 same day – within 24 hours, good.

- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision: Decision at 11:00, Inform at 13:00 same day – within 48 hours, good.

- Follow-up Call: Not mentioned in log, so probably not done. This is a desideratum failure.

**Case 2:**

- 2024-01-11 08:00: Application Received

- 08:20: Risk Assessment (No prior Credit Check – violates normative)

- 09:00: Credit Check (after Risk Assessment – wrong order)

- 09:30: Loan Decision (Rejected)

- 10:00: Finalize Documentation (not allowed after rejection)

- 10:30: Close Case

Normative violations:

- Risk Assessment before Credit Check: Should be Credit Check before Risk Assessment.

- Finalize Documentation after rejection: Explicitly not allowed.

Also, the sequence is messed up: App Received  Risk Assessment (skip Credit Check initially), then Credit Check after, which is out of order.

Loan Decision after Risk Assessment, that's ok, but Inform Applicant is missing? Wait, look at the log:

Activities: App Received, Risk Assessment, Credit Check, Loan Decision, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. No "Inform Applicant" step.

Check the log again:

| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity              |

| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received  |

| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment       |

| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check          |

| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected) |

| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation|

| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case            |

No "Inform Applicant" activity. According to normative rules, Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. This is a skipping of a required step.

Normative constraints say: "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision." And in the sequence, it's part of the flow.

So, violations:

- Credit Check not before Risk Assessment (Risk Assessment happened first)

- Inform Applicant skipped entirely

- Finalize Documentation after rejection

- Possibly closing case without informing applicant, but mainly the steps are wrong.

Justification: Maybe there was a system error or human mistake, but no justification can make this compliant.

**Case 3:**

- 2024-01-12 09:00: Application Received

- 2024-01-14 10:00: Credit Check (two days later)

- 2024-01-14 11:00: Risk Assessment

- 2024-01-14 12:00: Loan Decision (Approved)

- 2024-01-16 15:00: Inform Applicant (two days after decision? Let's calculate)

Decision on Jan 14, 12:00. Inform on Jan 16, 15:00. That's about 2 days and 3 hours later.

- 2024-01-17 09:00: Finalize Documentation

- 2024-01-17 10:00: Close Case

Sequence: App Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. Order seems correct for approved case.

No skipping, no wrong order apparent.

Normative: Should be fine, as long as all steps are in order and decision logic is followed.

Desiderata:

- Credit Check within 24 hours: Received Jan 12, 09:00. Credit Check Jan 14, 10:00. That's 2 days later, so more than 24 hours – violation of desideratum.

- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision: Decision Jan 14, 12:00. Inform Jan 16, 15:00. Time difference: from Jan 14 12:00 to Jan 16 12:00 is 48 hours, but inform is at 15:00, so 51 hours later? Wait, calculate properly.

From Jan 14, 12:00 to Jan 16, 12:00 is exactly 48 hours. Inform at Jan 16, 15:00 is 3 hours after that, so 51 hours total. So more than 48 hours – desideratum violation.

- Follow-up Call: Not mentioned, so probably not done – desideratum failure.

Now, for normative violations summary:

- Case 1: No normative violations.

- Case 2: Multiple normative violations:

  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order violation)

  - No Inform Applicant step (skipping required activity)

  - Finalize Documentation after rejection (contradictory action)

- Case 3: No normative violations, sequence is correct.

In Case 3, the order is correct: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, etc. Timings are late but that's desideratum.

Now, desiderata failures:

- Case 1: Possibly no Follow-up Call. Credit Check and Inform are on time.

- Case 2: Even if desiderata were considered, but since there are normative violations, desiderata might not be the focus, but:

  - Credit Check: Received at 08:00, Risk Assessment at 08:20 (but Credit Check at 09:00, which is after, but order is wrong). Time-wise, Credit Check at 09:00 is within 24 hours (from 08:00 same day), but since order is wrong, it's messy.

  - Inform Applicant not done, so definitely not within 48 hours.

  - No Follow-up Call.

  But primary issues are normative.

- Case 3: Credit Check late (>24h), Inform late (>48h), no Follow-up Call.

Justifications:

- For Case 2: Perhaps there was an emergency or miscommunication that led to out-of-order activities, but it clearly violates rules.

- For Case 3: Delays might be due to weekends or high workload, but still suboptimal.

Follow-up Call is not in the log for any case, so all cases might have this desideratum failure.

In Case 3 log, it says "*(No Follow-up Call)*" explicitly, but for others, it's not mentioned, but probably absent.

Assuming if not listed, it didn't happen.

Now, structure the answer.

**Answer Structure:**

1. Normative Violations:

- Case 1: No violations. Explanation: All steps in correct order, decision logic followed.

- Case 2: Violations include:

  - Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check, violating the order.

  - Inform Applicant step missing, skipping a required activity.

  - Finalize Documentation performed after rejection, which is not allowed.

- Case 3: No violations. Explanation: Sequence correct, all steps present and in order.

2. Desiderata Failures:

- Case 1: Fails to meet the desideratum of performing a Follow-up Call. Credit Check and Inform Applicant are timely.

- Case 2: Likely fails all desiderata due to normative violations, but specifically: No Inform Applicant, so cannot be within 48 hours; Credit Check might be timely but order wrong; no Follow-up Call.

- Case 3: Fails to meet:

  - Credit Check within 24 hours (took 2 days).

  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours (took about 51 hours).

  - No Follow-up Call.

Clarify that these are not severe.

3. Justifications:

- For Case 2 deviations: Could be due to human error, system glitch, or intentional bypass in urgent situations, but it contravenes the strict rules.

- For Case 3 delays: Might be justified by external factors like holidays (Jan 12 to 14 might include weekend), or resource constraints, making it suboptimal but not rule-breaking.

### 1. Identification of Normative Violations

The normative rules are strict and must be adhered to without exception. Based on the event log, I analyzed each case for compliance with the required sequence (Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case), ordering rules, and prohibitions (e.g., no skipping steps, no order changes, no finalizing documentation after rejection, and proper decision logic for closing the case).

- **Case 1:**  
  **Normative Violation:** None.  
  **Explanation:** The sequence of activities follows the strict normative rules perfectly. It starts with Application Received, followed by Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation (as required for approval), and Close Case. All ordering rules are satisfied: Credit Check occurs before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, and Inform Applicant after Loan Decision. Since the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation is performed before Close Case, and there are no skipped steps or contradictory actions.

- **Case 2:**  
  **Normative Violations:** Yes, multiple violations.  
  **Explanation of Violations:**  
  - **Order violation (Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment):** Risk Assessment is performed at 08:20, before Credit Check at 09:00, which directly contravenes the rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. This also implies a skipped step initially, as Credit Check was not completed before proceeding to Risk Assessment.  
  - **Skipping a required activity (Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision):** The "Inform Applicant" step is entirely missing from the log, despite Loan Decision being made. This violates the requirement that Inform Applicant must follow Loan Decision in the sequence.  
  - **Contradictory action (no Finalize Documentation after rejection):** Finalize Documentation is performed at 10:00, even though the Loan Decision was a rejection. This is explicitly prohibited, as the rules state that if the loan is rejected, documentation must not be finalized before closing the case.  
  - **Overall sequence disruption:** The case also involves improper closing, as the case is closed without adhering to the full decision logic (e.g., missing Inform Applicant and incorrect handling of rejection). These issues collectively breach the "no skipping, no order changes, and no contradictory actions" prohibitions.  
  **Summary:** This case has severe normative issues, indicating a significant deviation from the required process.

- **Case 3:**  
  **Normative Violation:** None.  
  **Explanation:** The sequence adheres to the normative rules. It begins with Application Received, followed by Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation (as required for approval), and Close Case. All ordering rules are met: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, and Inform Applicant after Loan Decision. Since the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation is correctly performed before Close Case, with no skipped steps or order changes.

**Overall Summary for Normative Violations:**  
- Case 1: Compliant.  
- Case 2: Non-compliant with multiple violations (order change, skipped step, and contradictory action).  
- Case 3: Compliant.

### 2. Identification of Desiderata Failures

Desiderata are recommended best practices and not strict rules, so deviations are not considered serious violations but rather suboptimal behaviors that could lead to inefficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, or missed opportunities for improvement. The key desiderata are:  
- Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours of Application Received.  
- Inform Applicant should occur within 48 hours of Loan Decision.  
- A Follow-up Call should be performed sometime before closing the case to ensure alignment (though it is not mandatory).

I analyzed each case for adherence to these recommendations. Note that the event log does not explicitly record a Follow-up Call for any case, so I assume it was not performed if not listed. Any failures here are noted as non-severe.

- **Case 1:**  
  **Desiderata Failures:** Partial failure (only one desideratum not met).  
  - **Credit Check within 24 hours:** Met – Application Received at 09:00, Credit Check at 09:30 on the same day (within 30 minutes, well under 24 hours).  
  - **Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision:** Met – Loan Decision at 11:00, Inform Applicant at 13:00 on the same day (within 2 hours).  
  - **Follow-up Call before Close Case:** Not met – No Follow-up Call is recorded in the log.  
  **Clarification on Suboptimality:** This is a minor deviation, as the only issue is the absence of the Follow-up Call, which is recommended for better communication but not critical. The process is otherwise efficient and timely.

- **Case 2:**  
  **Desiderata Failures:** Likely failure across all desiderata (but overshadowed by normative violations).  
  - **Credit Check within 24 hours:** Potentially met – Application Received at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00 on the same day (within 1 hour), but this is complicated by the normative order violation (Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check). Even if timely, the overall process disruption makes this irrelevant.  
  - **Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision:** Not met – Loan Decision at 09:30, but "Inform Applicant" is entirely missing, so it cannot be within 48 hours (or at all).  
  - **Follow-up Call before Close Case:** Not met – No Follow-up Call is recorded.  
  **Clarification on Suboptimality:** These failures are not severe on their own, as desiderata are flexible, but they compound the normative violations. For instance, the lack of Inform Applicant could lead to poor customer experience, and the absence of a Follow-up Call misses an opportunity for clarification. However, the primary concern here should be the normative breaches, which make this case highly suboptimal overall.

- **Case 3:**  
  **Desiderata Failures:** Failure across all desiderata.  
  - **Credit Check within 24 hours:** Not met – Application Received on 2024-01-12 at 09:00, Credit Check on 2024-01-14 at 10:00 (48 hours later, exceeding the 24-hour recommendation).  
  - **Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision:** Not met – Loan Decision on 2024-01-14 at 12:00, Inform Applicant on 2024-01-16 at 15:00 (51 hours later, exceeding the 48-hour recommendation by 3 hours).  
  - **Follow-up Call before Close Case:** Not met – Explicitly noted in the log as "No Follow-up Call."  
  **Clarification on Suboptimality:** These deviations are not rule-breaking but indicate inefficiencies, such as delays that could frustrate the applicant or increase operational risks. For example, the late Credit Check and Inform Applicant might stem from resource constraints, but they represent missed opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction and process speed. The absence of a Follow-up Call further reduces the chances for proactive issue resolution.

**Overall Summary for Desiderata Failures:**  
- Case 1: Suboptimal due to missing Follow-up Call; otherwise, timely and efficient.  
- Case 2: Suboptimal across multiple desiderata, but this is secondary to the normative violations.  
- Case 3: Suboptimal with failures in timing for Credit Check and Inform Applicant, plus no Follow-up Call.  
Remember, desiderata failures are not punitive and should be addressed through process improvements rather than strict enforcement.

### 3. Suggestions for Interpretations or Justifications

Where possible, I suggest interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors based on the normative constraints and desiderata. These are speculative and aim to provide reasonable explanations that align with real-world scenarios, while still acknowledging deviations. The goal is to frame deviations as potential learning opportunities rather than just criticisms.

- **Case 1:**  
  **Interpretation/Justification:** This case exemplifies ideal adherence to both normative rules and desiderata (except for the missing Follow-up Call). The efficient timing (e.g., Credit Check and Inform Applicant occurring on the same day) could be attributed to a well-resourced team or automated systems that prioritize quick processing. The absence of a Follow-up Call might be justified by resource allocation—e.g., if the process is handled digitally with clear communication, it may not have been deemed necessary. However, incorporating a Follow-up Call could still improve customer relations without disrupting the normative sequence.

- **Case 2:**  
  **Interpretation/Justification:** The multiple normative violations suggest a significant process breakdown, which could be interpreted as human error, system failure, or an attempt to expedite the process in a high-pressure situation. For instance:  
  - The Risk Assessment before Credit Check might indicate a mistaken prioritization (e.g., an analyst jumping ahead due to incomplete training or a glitch in workflow software).  
  - The skipped "Inform Applicant" step and unauthorized Finalize Documentation could stem from oversight or miscommunication, such as assuming rejection implies no need for formal notification (though this is unjustified under the rules).  
  - For desiderata, the failures (e.g., no Inform Applicant) might reflect the same chaotic execution, but could be loosely justified by an urgent need to close cases quickly (e.g., end-of-quarter pressures). However, these deviations cannot be excused under the strict normative framework and highlight the need for better controls, such as automated checks or training. In a real-world context, this case could represent a "firefighting" approach that risks regulatory issues or customer complaints.

- **Case 3:**  
  **Interpretation/Justification:** This case complies with normative rules but fails desiderata, which could be explained by external factors rather than intentional non-compliance. For example:  
  - The Credit Check delay (beyond 24 hours) might be due to weekends or holidays (e.g., if 2024-01-13 was a non-working day, this could justify the lag as unavoidable). Similarly, the Inform Applicant delay (beyond 48 hours) could result from staffing shortages or backlog, making it a suboptimal but realistic outcome in a busy period.  
  - The absence of a Follow-up Call might be a cost-saving measure or an oversight in a less customer-focused approach, but it could be justified if the process relies heavily on digital communication (e.g., emails) that reduces the perceived need for calls.  
  Overall, these deviations suggest operational inefficiencies that could be addressed through better scheduling or reminders, aligning with the desiderata's intent to promote timeliness and communication without violating normative constraints.

**General Insights:**  
- Normative violations (e.g., in Case 2) indicate critical process failures that could lead to compliance issues, while desiderata failures (common across cases) point to areas for optimization.  
- Justifications should always be balanced against the rules—e.g., delays in Case 3 might be excusable in context but still warrant review to prevent recurrence. In practice, monitoring tools could help enforce desiderata as "soft goals" while strictly guarding normative rules. If you have additional data (e.g., on weekends or team capacity), more tailored justifications could be provided.
