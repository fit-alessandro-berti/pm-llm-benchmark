The provided flow details seem to represent a complex approval and payment request process, typically found in corporate financial or administrative systems. The steps and transitions between various states of declarations (requests) illustrate a path from initial submission by an employee through multiple layers of approvals and rejections until the declaration is either approved for final review/supervisor approval or rejected back to the initiating state.

### Key Process Phases:
1. **Submission:** Declarations can be submitted initially by an EMPLOYEE. This action creates a request that goes into various states depending on how it's handled.
2. **Approval Pathways:**
   - A declaration may be approved at different levels (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER) and then finalized by the SUPERVISOR.
   - Approvals can lead directly to the payment request phase or be further processed to a final approval.
3. **Rejection Handling:** Rejections at any point in the process can either terminate the declaration or redirect it back for resubmission by the EMPLOYEE, potentially restarting the cycle from submission.
4. **Final Approval and Payment Request:**
   - Declarations reaching FINAL_APPROVED status by SUPERVISOR will then typically transition to a payment request phase.
   - There's also an instance showing that declarations directly go into the payment handled state after final approval.

### Process Flow Analysis:
- **Normal Approval Path:** Declaration SUBMITTED -> APPROVED (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER) -> APPROVED BY BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled.
  - This path reflects a typical scenario where all necessary approvals are given before payment is requested and handled.
  
- **Rejection Flow:**
  - Any rejection at any point in the approval cycle (e.g., REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER) may lead back to SUBMITTED or FOR_APPROVAL states, allowing for correction and resubmission.
  - Rejections can also create loops that lead to a higher chance of declaration termination if repeated rejections occur without successful submission.

- **Alternative Paths:**
  - Some declarations go directly from final approval by supervisor to payment handled (likely bypassing intermediate steps in some cases).
  - There are direct transitions like "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment," which suggests a quicker route for specific scenarios.
  
### Performance Metrics:
The performance metrics attached to each transition suggest how efficiently the process is working. For example, transitions with lower frequencies but higher performances indicate critical points where delays might occur (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by MISSING). Understanding these can help in pinpointing bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

In summary, this data reflects a multi-level approval process for payment requests in a corporate environment, with various checks and balances at different levels to ensure accuracy and compliance before finalizing any payments. The detailed flow allows for the identification of key points where intervention or optimization might be needed based on observed performance metrics.
