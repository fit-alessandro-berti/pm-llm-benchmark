# Temporal Profile for Global Supply Chain Process

Based on the described high-tech electronics supply chain process, I'll construct a temporal profile dictionary with estimated times reflecting realistic industrial scenarios.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct sequential pairs (adjacent activities)

## Explanation of Time Estimates

| Phase | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| **SS  OP** | Supplier negotiations and approvals typically take 1-3 days |
| **OP  RC** | International component shipping averages ~7 days with high variance |
| **RC  QI  CA** | Warehouse operations are measured in hours |
| **CA  PT  PK** | Manufacturing floor activities span a single shift to a day |
| **WS  DT** | Inventory holding before shipment varies by demand |
| **DT  AS** | Time until customer needs support is highly variable |

The standard deviations reflect real-world variability:
- **Higher variance**: Supplier lead times, shipping, customer support timing
- **Lower variance**: Controlled factory floor operations (inspection, assembly, testing)
