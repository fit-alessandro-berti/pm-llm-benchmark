Based on the provided directly follows graph, we can describe the underlying process as follows. This process involves multiple object types, including Handling Unit, Truck, Container, Vehicle, Forklift, Customer Order, and Transport Document. Here's a breakdown of the process flow for each object type:

1. **Handling Unit**:
   - The process starts with "Collect Goods" followed by "Load Truck".

2. **Truck**:
   - Trucks are loaded multiple times ("Load Truck" -> "Load Truck").
   - After loading, trucks drive to the terminal ("Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal").
   - Trucks can also loop between driving to the terminal and loading ("Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck").

3. **Container**:
   - The container process begins with ordering empty containers ("Order Empty Containers").
   - Empty containers are then picked up ("Pick Up Empty Container") and loaded onto trucks ("Load Truck").
   - Loaded trucks drive to the terminal ("Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal").
   - Containers are weighed at the terminal ("Drive to Terminal" -> "Weigh").
   - After weighing, containers are either placed in stock or brought to the loading bay.
   - Containers in stock are later brought to the loading bay ("Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay").
   - Containers at the loading bay are loaded onto vehicles ("Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle").
   - Loaded vehicles depart ("Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart").
   - Containers may also be rescheduled ("Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Reschedule Container") and later loaded onto vehicles ("Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle").

4. **Vehicle**:
   - Vehicles are booked ("Book Vehicles") and loaded ("Load to Vehicle").
   - Loaded vehicles depart ("Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart").
   - Vehicles may also be rescheduled ("Book Vehicles" -> "Reschedule Container") and later booked or loaded.

5. **Forklift**:
   - Forklifts bring containers to the loading bay ("Bring to Loading Bay") and load them onto vehicles ("Load to Vehicle").
   - Forklifts also weigh containers ("Weigh") and place them in stock ("Place in Stock").
   - They move containers between the loading bay, stock, and vehicles.

6. **Customer Order**:
   - The customer order process begins with registering the order ("Register Customer Order").
   - After registration, a transport document is created ("Create Transport Document").

7. **Transport Document**:
   - The process starts with creating the transport document ("Create Transport Document").
   - Vehicles are booked ("Book Vehicles"), and empty containers are ordered ("Order Empty Containers").
   - The process ends with departure ("Depart"), but there can be rescheduling loops ("Reschedule Container").

The process involves a complex interplay between different object types, with containers being handled by trucks, forklifts, and vehicles, and the overall flow coordinated through customer orders and transport documents. The process also includes loops for repeated actions like loading, booking, and rescheduling.
