Based on the constraints provided, I will attempt to describe the underlying process. Please note that this is an interpretation, and there might be some nuances or details that I miss.

**Overview**

The process appears to be related to handling declarations and payments within an organization. The main activities involved are:

1. Declaration submission by an employee
2. Declaration approval by a supervisor
3. Requesting payment
4. Handling payment

**Process Flow**

Here's a high-level overview of the process flow:

1. **Initialization**: The process starts with a declaration submission by an employee (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
2. **Approval**: The submitted declaration is then approved by a supervisor (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
3. **Request Payment**: After approval, a payment request is made (`Request Payment`).
4. **Handle Payment**: The payment is then handled (`Payment Handled`).

**Constraints and Rules**

Some key constraints and rules governing this process are:

* A declaration can only be submitted once (`Exactly 1: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
* A declaration must be approved by a supervisor before a payment can be requested (`Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')`).
* A payment can only be handled after a payment request has been made (`Precedence: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')`).
* A declaration approval is required for a payment to be handled (`Co-Existence: ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled')`).
* A payment request can only be made after a declaration has been approved (`Response: ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')`).

**Absence and Non-Coexistence**

The process also explicitly states the absence of certain activities, such as declaration rejection by various roles (`Absence: Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER,...`). Additionally, there are non-coexistence constraints, which ensure that certain activities cannot occur together (`Non Co-Existence` constraints are not explicitly listed, but they can be inferred from the absence constraints).

Overall, this process appears to be a linear, sequential workflow with a focus on ensuring proper approval and handling of declarations and payments.
