The visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram. It depicts the process of calculating and delivering a credit score.  Let's break down the stages:

**1. Request Initiation (Top Section):**

* **Scoring Request Received:** The process starts when the front-end (likely a customer-facing application) sends a request for a credit score to the credit scoring bank.
* **Delay Information Received:** There's a delay in processing the information received, as the bank needs to process incoming data.
* **Report Delay:** Represents a time delay for the bank to prepare its response.
* **Credit Score Received:** The bank sends back the credit score after its calculation and processing.
* **Send Credit Score:** The bank relays the credit score.
* **Scoring Request Handled:** Indicates that the credit scoring process has concluded successfully.

**2. Scoring Calculation (Bottom Section):**

* **Scoring Request Received:** The credit scoring service receives the credit request.
* **Compute Credit Score (Level 1):** The initial calculation of the credit score.
* **Score Available?:** Checks if a score (from the Level 1 calculation) is available.
* **Yes:** If the score is available, the system proceeds to send the credit score.
* **No:** If the score isn't available (perhaps the data is incomplete), the process goes into a "report delay" stage.
* **Report Delay:** This is a processing delay for the bank to collect missing data.
* **Compute Credit Score (Level 2):** If no score was initially available, the system performs a secondary calculation.
* **Send Credit Score:** The system sends the calculated credit score.
* **Scoring Request Handled:** A final step verifying successful completion of the scoring process.

**Overall Process:**

The diagram shows a two-tiered system for calculating a credit score. A request is initially handled, and if necessary, a more in-depth calculation is triggered.  This illustrates a potential for error handling (checking score availability) and fallback for missing information to improve robustness of the credit scoring service. The `inkl. ID for message queuing` element suggests that message queuing is used to handle the communication between different parts of the process.


In essence, the diagram outlines a workflow for handling credit score requests, emphasizing both immediate and delayed scoring options to ensure a robust response.
