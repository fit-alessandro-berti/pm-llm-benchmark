To construct a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process, we need to define the constraints based on the activities involved. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the constraints:

1. **Equivalence:** There are no activities that must occur the same number of times.
2. **Always Before:** Certain activities must occur before others.
3. **Always After:** Certain activities must occur after others.
4. **Never Together:** There are no activities that cannot co-exist in the same case.
5. **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity has specific bounds on the number of occurrences.
6. **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Certain activities must directly follow others.

Let's define these constraints in the Python dictionary format:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No equivalence constraints
    'always_before': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    },
    'always_after': set(),  # No always after constraints
    'never_together': set(),  # No never together constraints
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order': {1},  # Each order is received once
        'Check Availability': {1},  # Checked once per order
        'Reserve Items': {1},  # Reserved once per order
        'Pick Items': {1},  # Picked once per order
        'Quality Check': {1},  # Quality checked once per order
        'Pack Order': {1},  # Packed once per order
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},  # Generated once per order
        'Dispatch': {1},  # Dispatched once per order
        'Invoice Customer': {1},  # Invoiced once per order
        'Record Payment': {1}  # Recorded once per order
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    }
}

print(log_skeleton)
```

This dictionary represents the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process, capturing the necessary constraints and activity occurrences.
