Integrated Event Log for Order#1234  
(primary timestamp = System A when present; secondary_timestamp = System B when merged)

| # | primary_timestamp | secondary_timestamp | unified_event_name | source(s) | order_id | user_id | resource_id | notes / comments |
|---|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | 2023-10-10 10:00:00 Z | 2023-10-10 09:59:58 Z | Order Received | A + B | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | “Event captured at warehouse system”. 2-second gap  considered same physical event. |
| 2 | 2023-10-10 10:01:30 Z | 2023-10-10 10:01:29 Z | Order Validated | A + B | Order#1234 | u12 | r10 | “Cross-check inventory”. 1-second gap, identical stage. |
| 3 | 2023-10-10 10:02:00 Z | 2023-10-10 10:02:05 Z | Payment Processed | A + B | Order#1234 | u12 | r99 | “Payment gateway delay”. 5-second gap—outside 2-s guideline, but same order & unique stage name; merged with note explaining offset. |
| 4 | 2023-10-10 10:03:00 Z | — | Quality Check | B only | Order#1234 | u45 | r11 | “Random inspection”. No counterpart in A. |
| 5 | 2023-10-10 10:05:00 Z | 2023-10-10 10:05:02 Z | Item Shipped | A + B | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | “Package handed to courier”. 2-second gap. |
| 6 | 2023-10-10 10:20:00 Z | — | Item Delivered | A only | Order#1234 | — | — | No matching event in B; kept as-is. |

Reasoning & Methodology
1. Matching key = (order_id + nearest timestamp).  
   • Start with each System A event (primary timeline).  
   • Search System B for the same order_id whose timestamp lies within a tolerance window; default 2 seconds ( network latency between systems).  
   • For the Payment step the closest B record was 5 s away. Although outside the strict window, it is the only payment-stage event for Order#1234; the names (“Payment Processed” vs “PaymentCheck”) and sequence position align, so we opted to merge but flagged the larger drift.  
2. Attribute merging.  
   • All fields from both logs are preserved; duplicate/near-duplicate values (e.g., event names) are unified under unified_event_name but original names remain traceable via “source(s)” and notes.  
   • When both timestamps are kept, “primary_timestamp” (System A) is used for ordering; “secondary_timestamp” provides the raw System B capture time.  
3. Unmatched events.  
   • “Quality Check” (B) and “Item Delivered” (A) appear only once; they are inserted independently and clearly labeled with their single-log origin.  
4. Conflict resolution.  
   • No contradictory data values were encountered.  
   • Where both systems supplied timestamps, slight discrepancies are recorded rather than overwritten to maintain audit fidelity.  
5. Result.  
   • The final integrated log is a chronologically ordered, attribute-rich, end-to-end trace of the order’s lifecycle, suitable for downstream analytics or process-mining tasks.
