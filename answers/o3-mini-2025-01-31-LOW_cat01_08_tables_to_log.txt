Below is one example of an integrated event log that combines all the provided ERP tables into a single, chronologically ordered “eventperrow” log. In this example, we use the order_id as the case identifier and create events for order creation, item picking (one row per line item), delivery dispatch and arrival (one row each per shipment), invoice issuing, and payment receipt. In cases where there are multiple deliveries, invoices, or payments for a single order the log includes one row per such event. In addition, the “Resource/Actor” column is enriched using the Resources table when available, and an “Attributes” column is provided to capture extra details (such as quantities, amounts, item IDs, or notes).  

Note:  
• For order 1004 no delivery/invoice/payment events are provided, so only the order creation and item picking events appear.  
• When multiple item picking events exist for an order, each pick is recorded in its own row.  
• In ambiguous cases (for example, when multiple invoices/payments exist for an order) the event log lists each event individually in the order of their timestamps.  

Below is the final event log in Markdown format:


Case ID | Activity Name       | Timestamp              | Resource/Actor        | Attributes

Assumptions and Notes:  
1. The “Order Created” event uses the order_date with the corresponding sales person’s name (using the Resources table).  
2. Each “Item Picked” event uses the item_picking_date from the Order Lines table. One event is logged for each line item.  
3. Each delivery record generates two events – one for dispatch and one for arrival – with the carrier’s name taken from the Resources table.  
4. Invoice and Payment events include identifiers and monetary amounts where available.  
5. For Payment events, the “Resource/Actor” field is shown as the payment channel when no user details are available.  

This integrated event log preserves the entire sequence—from order creation to the final payment received—and can be used as input for process mining software.
