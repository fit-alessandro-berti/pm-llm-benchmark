Certainly! Below is a Python code snippet that constructs a ProcessTree object representing an example of a "Purchase-to-Pay" (P2P) business process. This hypothetical P2P process includes steps such as Request Purchase Order, Approve Purchase Order, Receive Goods, Invoice Receipt, and Payment.

Firstly, make sure you have the `pm4py` library installed. You can install it using pip if necessary:

```bash
pip install pm4py
```

Here is the Python code to build a process tree for this hypothetical P2P process:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define root of the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Define sequence nodes and activities
req_po_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
approve_po_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
inv_receipt_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
payment_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP)

# Add children to the sequence for Request Purchase Order
request_purchase_order = ProcessTree(label="Request Purchase Order", parent=req_po_seq)
check_availability = ProcessTree(label="Check Availability", parent=req_po_seq)
req_po_seq.children.append(request_purchase_order)
req_po_seq.children.append(check_availability)

# Add children to the sequence for Approve Purchase Order
approve_purchase_order = ProcessTree(label="Approve Purchase Order", parent=approve_po_seq)
send_to_supplier = ProcessTree(label="Send PO to Supplier", parent=approve_po_seq)
approve_po_seq.children.append(approve_purchase_order)
approve_po_seq.children.append(send_to_supplier)

# Add children to the sequence for Invoice Receipt
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=inv_receipt_seq)
verify_goods = ProcessTree(label="Verify Goods", parent=inv_receipt_seq)
inv_receipt_seq.children.append(receive_goods)
inv_receipt_seq.children.append(verify_goods)

# Add nested process tree for Payment Loop
invoice_received = ProcessTree(label="Invoice Received", parent=payment_loop)
validate_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Validate Invoice", parent=payment_loop)
process_payment = ProcessTree(label="Process Payment", parent=payment_loop)
payment_loop.children.append(invoice_received)
payment_loop.children.append(validate_invoice)

# Adding sequences and loop to the root parallel process tree
root.children.append(req_po_seq)
root.children.append(approve_po_seq)
root.children.append(inv_receipt_seq)
root.children.append(payment_loop)

print("Process Tree built successfully.")
```

In this code:
- The `request_purchase_order` sequence involves requesting a purchase order followed by checking availability.
- The `approve_purchase_order` sequence follows the request and includes approving it before sending the PO to the supplier.
- The `inv_receipt_seq` represents receiving goods and verifying them as part of the invoice receipt process.
- A loop is created for handling invoices received, validating them, and processing payments. This ensures that the process can repeat until all invoices are settled.

This example should give you a good starting point to model other business processes using the `pm4py` library's ProcessTree objects.
