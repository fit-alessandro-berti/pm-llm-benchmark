Here's a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases with more than six events and returns all events from cases with six or fewer events:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
    HAVING 
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)

SELECT 
    e.*
FROM 
    event_log e
INNER JOIN 
    case_event_counts c
    ON e.case_id = c.case_id
ORDER BY 
    e.case_id, 
    e.timestamp;
```

### Explanation:

1. The `case_event_counts` CTE calculates the number of events per `case_id` and filters to only include cases with â‰¤6 events using `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`.

2. The main query then joins the original `event_log` with this filtered list of case IDs to retrieve all events from the qualifying cases.

3. The results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` (assuming you want events in chronological order within each case).

This approach is efficient because it first identifies the qualifying cases before joining back to get all their events, rather than scanning the entire event log multiple times.

Would you like me to modify this query in any way to better suit your needs?
