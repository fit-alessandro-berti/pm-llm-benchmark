To address the requirements of the benchmark, we need to carefully construct a DuckDB SQL query that adheres to the following steps:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify Cases with the Specific Activity Sequence**:
   - We need to find cases (`case_id`) where the activities `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, `'Create Order'`, and `'Confirm Order'` occur in direct succession.

2. **Filter Cases Based on Time Condition**:
   - For the identified cases, further filter those where the time difference between the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events is more than 5 days.

3. **Exclude Relevant Cases from Final Result**:
   - Once the cases meeting both criteria are identified, exclude all events from these cases from the final result.

4. **Return All Remaining Events**:
   - The final output should include all events from `event_log` except those belonging to the excluded cases.

Below is the SQL query that implements this logic:

### SQL Query:

```sql
WITH sequenced_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity_2,
        LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity_1,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_1
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_identification AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM sequenced_events
    WHERE 
        prev_activity_2 = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND
        prev_activity_1 = 'Create Order' AND
        activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
time_condition AS (
    SELECT
        e.case_id
    FROM event_log e
    JOIN sequence_identification s ON e.case_id = s.case_id
    WHERE 
        e.activity = 'Create Order' OR e.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    QUALIFY
        MAX(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN timestamp END) 
            - MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Create Order' THEN timestamp END) > INTERVAL '5 days'
    GROUP BY e.case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM time_condition);
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **`sequenced_events` CTE**:
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) uses window functions (`LAG` and `LEAD`) to identify the activities before and after each event within the same `case_id`.
   - For each event, it captures:
     - `prev_activity_2`: The activity two steps before the current event.
     - `prev_activity_1`: The activity one step before the current event.
     - `next_activity_1`: The activity one step after the current event.

2. **`sequence_identification` CTE**:
   - Filters out cases where the sequence `'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'` exists.
   - Ensures that the activities occur in the exact order by checking the values of `prev_activity_2`, `prev_activity_1`, and `activity`.

3. **`time_condition` CTE**:
   - For the cases identified in the previous step, this CTE checks if the time difference between the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events exceeds 5 days.
   - It uses `MAX` and `MIN` with conditional aggregation to calculate the time difference for each case.

4. **Final Selection**:
   - The main query retrieves all events from `event_log` where the `case_id` does not belong to the set of cases identified in the `time_condition` CTE.
   - This ensures that only events from cases that do not meet the specified sequence and timing condition are included in the final result.

### Key Considerations:
- **Performance**: The use of window functions and conditional filtering ensures efficient identification of sequences and time conditions.
- **Correctness**: The query strictly adheres to the problem's requirements by first identifying the relevant cases and then excluding them from the final result.
- **Scalability**: The query is designed to handle large datasets by leveraging partitioning and grouping operations.

This query satisfies all the requirements outlined in the prompt.
