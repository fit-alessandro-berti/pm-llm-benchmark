Here's a thinking process to arrive at the detailed explanation of the pseudo-BPMN diagram:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for a detailed explanation of the business process depicted in the pseudo-BPMN. This means translating the visual representation into clear, descriptive language. Key elements to cover are the purpose of each step, the function of gateways, and the flow of execution.

2. **Break Down the Diagram:**  The diagram is sequential, so a step-by-step approach makes sense. I'll start from the "Start Event" and follow the flow.

3. **Analyze Each Step:** For each element in the diagram, I'll ask myself:
    * **What is it?** (Task, Gateway, Event)
    * **What's its purpose?** (What does it achieve in the business process?)
    * **What are the inputs/outputs?** (What information does it need, and what does it produce?)

4. **Handle Gateways Carefully:** Gateways control the flow. I need to clearly explain:
    * **Type of Gateway:** (XOR, AND)
    * **Condition for Branching (XOR):** What determines which path is taken?
    * **Purpose of Parallelism (AND):** Why are tasks run simultaneously?
    * **Join Logic (AND Join):** How does the process continue after parallel tasks?

5. **Trace the Different Paths:** The diagram has distinct paths for "Standard" and "Custom" requests. I'll trace each path separately and note the differences in the tasks involved.

6. **Identify Convergence and Loops:**
    * **Convergence:** Where do different paths meet up again?  This is often at another gateway.
    * **Loops:**  Are there any points where the process goes back to a previous step? What are the conditions for looping?

7. **Focus on "Standard" vs. "Custom":** The question specifically asks about the difference between these paths. I need to highlight the tasks unique to each and the decision points that lead to these different flows.

8. **Explain Approvals and Rework:** The approval process is a significant part of the diagram. I need to clearly explain:
    * **When is approval needed?**
    * **Who provides the approval?**
    * **What happens if approval is granted?**
    * **What happens if approval is denied?** (The rework/looping mechanism)

9. **Structure the Explanation:** A logical structure will make the explanation easier to understand. I'll use headings and bullet points to organize the information:
    * Overview of the Process
    * Step-by-Step Breakdown (following the diagram's flow)
    * Explanation of Gateways
    * Standard vs. Custom Request Handling
    * Approvals and Rework

10. **Use Clear and Concise Language:** Avoid jargon where possible, and define any technical terms used. The goal is to make the explanation accessible to someone who might not be familiar with BPMN.

11. **Review and Refine:** After drafting the explanation, I'll reread it to ensure accuracy, clarity, and completeness. I'll check if I've answered all parts of the question. For instance, I need to ensure I've explicitly stated the *purpose* of each step and the *meaning* of each gateway.

**Self-Correction Example during the Process:**

* **Initial thought:**  Just describe the tasks.
* **Correction:** The prompt asks for the *purpose* of each step, not just what it is called. I need to explain *why* each task is performed.

* **Initial thought:**  Briefly mention the XOR gateway.
* **Correction:** The prompt specifically asks for the *meaning* of the gateways. I need to clearly explain the decision-making logic of each XOR gateway.

* **Initial thought:**  Describe the "Standard" and "Custom" paths separately.
* **Correction:**  The prompt asks *how* the tasks differ. I should explicitly compare the tasks in the two paths.

By following these steps and engaging in self-correction, I can construct a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the pseudo-BPMN diagram.
