1) How do market research insights explicitly translate into design priorities for the R&D prototype, and what mechanisms ensure rapid feedback loops across markets?
2) What criteria determine the decision to split component sourcing across multiple countries, and how are geopolitical and supplier concentration risks weighed against cost and quality?
3) How is supplier redundancy structured for each critical component, and what triggers a rapid switch to alternative vendors without disrupting lead times?
4) In what ways are design-for-manufacturability and design-for-resilience built into the prototype phase to accommodate potential component substitutions?
5) What risk models guide the parallel gateway for securing components, and how do these models account for currency fluctuations, trade restrictions, and logistics bottlenecks?
6) How is end-to-end visibility (from component suppliers to final distribution) achieved, and what data standards enable interoperable tracking across jurisdictions?
7) What lead-time compression strategies exist between component shipping and assembly, and how are buffer stocks sized to balance cash flow and resilience?
8) How does the 24/7 assembly operation manage workforce well-being, automation levels, and preventive maintenance to minimize quality drift over time?
9) What statistical methods are used in the quality checks to detect systemic defects early, and how do rework loops feed into continuous process improvement?
10) How are ethical and sustainability considerations (e.g., labor practices, carbon footprint) embedded into supplier selection and logistics routing decisions?
11) What decision criteria determine air freight versus cargo ship allocations, and how do demand volatility and product launch timelines influence these thresholds?
12) How are customs and regulatory changes proactively monitored, and what contingency playbooks exist for accelerated compliance in new or shifting markets?
13) What SLAs and KPIs govern the handoff between customs clearance and regional distribution centers, and how are exceptions escalated and resolved?
14) How does the network of regional distribution centers dynamically re-balance inventory in response to real-time sell-through data and promotional campaigns?
15) What mechanisms coordinate local warehousing, retailer distribution, e-commerce fulfillment, and VIP shipments to avoid channel conflict and stockouts?
16) How are demand sensing and forecasting models calibrated across regions with different data quality and seasonality, and how is forecast bias detected?
17) What governance structure oversees cross-functional decisions (procurement, logistics, sales, finance), and how are trade-offs documented and communicated?
18) How is performance measured across the full chain (cost, service level, quality, flexibility, sustainability), and what balanced scorecard or OKRs are used?
19) What scenario planning is conducted for black swan events (pandemics, political instability, cyberattacks), and how often are stress tests executed?
20) How do lessons learned from each sales cycle feed back into R&D, supplier contracts, and logistics network design to drive continuous improvement?
