The main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group are as follows:

1. The protected group has a wider range of process variants compared to the unprotected group. The protected group includes variants such as applying for a viewing appointment and then rejecting the prospective tenant, while the unprotected group has fewer process variants and mostly involves going through the entire process (from viewing appointment to rejecting or canceling the tenancy).
2. The protected group has a higher frequency of rejecting prospective tenants at the viewing appointment stage, while the unprotected group has a higher frequency of proceeding to the next steps, such as handling paperwork, screening, and move-in processes.
3. The average performance time for the protected group is higher compared to the unprotected group, indicating that the processes for the protected group take longer to complete.
4. The protected group has more variants with additional steps (e.g., extensive screening, multiple rent payments, and tenant cancellation), which contribute to the longer performance times.
5. The protected group has fewer cases of tenants canceling the apartment or missing rent payments, while the unprotected group has a higher frequency of these occurrences.

In summary, the main differences are the variety of process variants, the decision-making points at different stages of the process, and the overall performance and outcome in terms of tenant behavior.
