### Analysis of Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Unusually Short Timing: Evaluate to Notify (E  N)**
	- **Observation:** The average time between the **Evaluate** step and **Notify** is 5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1 minute. This is an extremely short period, which could indicate that the notification step is being performed prematurely, skipping other intermediate activities or required checks.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- The system might automatically notify customers without waiting for manual approval or additional evaluations.
		- Skipped steps: The **Approve** step might be omitted for some claims.
		- Potential cause: Incorrectly configured triggers or automated notifications in the system.

**Verification Query:**sql

```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    TIMESTAMPDIFF('minute', 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END), 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END)) AS time_diff_minutes
FROM 
    claim_events
GROUP BY 
    claim_id
HAVING 
    time_diff_minutes <= 10; -- Identify claims where the Evaluate to Notify time is less than or equal to 10 minutes
```

1. **Unusually Consistent Timing: Receive to Approve (R  P)**
	- **Observation:** The average time between **Receive** and **Approve** is approximately 25 hours, with an extremely low standard deviation of 1 hour. This consistency might suggest artificial or rigid scheduling for approvals, which is not explained by typical business logic.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- There could be a predefined batched approval process forcing all claims to be approved at fixed intervals.
		- Potential cause: Lack of individual review or delays affecting claims based on their characteristics (e.g., certain adjusters or claim types might process faster but are grouped into the same batch).

**Verification Query:**sql

```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    TIMESTAMPDIFF('hour', 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END), 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END)) AS time_diff_hours
FROM 
    claim_events
GROUP BY 
    claim_id
HAVING 
    time_diff_hours BETWEEN 24 AND 26; -- Identify claims with time difference close to 25 hours
```

1. **Prolonged Delays: Approve to Notify (P  N)**
	- **Observation:** The average time between **Approve** and **Notify** is 7 days, with a standard deviation of 2 days. This large time gap and high variability suggest significant bottlenecks or inconsistent handling.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- The notification process might be delayed due to resource constraints or backlogs in the system.
		- Potential cause: Manual steps or communication bottlenecks delaying notification.

**Verification Query:**sql

```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END), 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END)) AS time_diff_days
FROM 
    claim_events
GROUP BY 
    claim_id
HAVING 
    time_diff_days > 5; -- Identify claims where Approve to Notify takes more than 5 days
```

1. **Rapid Closures: Assign to Close (A  C)**
	- **Observation:** Some claims are closed only 2 hours after being assigned to an adjuster, without passing through evaluation or approval. This might indicate premature closures.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- Possibly due to human error, claims are closed without thorough review.
		- System misconfigurations may bypass standard workflows.
		- Adjusters could be marking claims as closed without completing necessary steps.

**Verification Query:**sql

```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    TIMESTAMPDIFF('hour', 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END), 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END)) AS time_diff_hours
FROM 
    claim_events
GROUP BY 
    claim_id
HAVING 
    time_diff_hours <= 3; -- Identify claims closed within 3 hours after assignment
```

1. **Short Time Span: Notify to Close (N  C)**
	- **Observation:** The average time between **Notify** and **Close** is only 30 minutes, with a standard deviation of 5 minutes. This short time might indicate that the close activity is triggered too quickly after notification.
	- **Hypothesis:**
		- The close step might be triggered automatically by the notification.
		- Skipped verification or follow-up steps might be occurring.

**Verification Query:**sql

```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    TIMESTAMPDIFF('minute', 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END), 
                  MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END)) AS time_diff_minutes
FROM 
    claim_events
GROUP BY 
    claim_id
HAVING 
    time_diff_minutes <= 10; -- Identify claims where Notify to Close happens in less than 10 minutes
```

### Potential Additional Analysis

- **Correlation with Adjusters or Claim Types:** Some anomalies might be tied to specific adjusters or claim types. We can filter anomalies by adjuster or region to determine if there are patterns affecting only certain groups.

**Query for Adjuster-Specific Anomalies:**

```sql
SELECT 
    resource, 
    COUNT(*) AS count_anomalies
FROM (
    SELECT 
        claim_id, 
        resource, 
        TIMESTAMPDIFF('hour', 
                      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END), 
                      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END)) AS time_diff_hours
    FROM 
        claim_events
    GROUP BY 
        claim_id
    HAVING 
        time_diff_hours <= 3  -- Example: Claims closed quickly after assignment
) anomalies
GROUP BY 
    resource
ORDER BY 
    count_anomalies DESC;
```

These queries aim to identify specific claims or patterns responsible for the anomalies, enabling root cause analysis and targeted resolution.
