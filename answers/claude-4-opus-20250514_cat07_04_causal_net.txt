This visualization appears to be a business process model or workflow diagram, likely in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) or a similar notation style. 

The main diagram shows a process flow with the following elements:

**Process Steps (represented by rounded rectangles):**
- a: register request (start)
- b: examine thoroughly
- c: examine casually  
- d: check ticket
- e: decide
- f: reinitiate request
- g: pay compensation
- h: reject request
- z: end

**Process Flow:**
The process begins at "register request" (a) and branches out to three parallel examination activities (b, c, d). These paths converge at a "decide" point (e), which then leads to three possible outcomes:
1. Pay compensation (g)  end (z)
2. Reject request (h)  end (z)  
3. Reinitiate request (f)  loops back to check ticket (d)

**Key Features:**
- The diagram uses black dots to represent gateways/decision points
- Lines with arrows show the flow direction
- There's a loop structure where requests can be reinitiated

**Legend Box:**
At the bottom, there's a reference legend showing different types of gateway patterns:
- XOR-split and XOR-join (exclusive choice - only one path)
- AND-split and AND-join (parallel paths - all paths)
- OR-split and OR-join (inclusive choice - one or more paths)

This appears to be modeling some kind of request or claim handling process, possibly for insurance or compensation claims.
