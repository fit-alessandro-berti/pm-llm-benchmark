##  Explanation of Logic

### **Case Identification:**
- **Case_001** corresponds to the user's activity around **Document1.docx** and **Email - Inbox**.
- **Case_002** represents the **Budget_2024.xlsx** document, including the switch to **Document1.docx** for a reference.
- **Case_003** is the **Quarterly_Report.docx** document, which was opened after the previous document was closed.

The cases were grouped based on the **document or application context** and **temporal proximity**. Each time the user opened a new document or started a new task, a new case was initiated.

---

### **Activity Naming:**
- **FOCUS** was interpreted as **"Open Document"** to indicate the start of a new case.
- **TYPING** was generalized to **"Start Typing"** and **"Continue Typing"** to differentiate between initial and ongoing input.
- **SAVE** was mapped to **"Save Document"**.
- **SWITCH** was interpreted as **"Switch Application"**.
- **CLICK** actions were grouped under **"Open Email"**, **"Reply to Email"**, and **"Send Email"** based on the context.
- **SCROLL** and **HIGHLIGHT** were translated to **"Scroll Document"** and **"Highlight Text"** respectively.

---

### **Additional Attributes:**
- **App** and **Window** were retained as additional attributes to provide context for the activity.
- **Timestamp** is preserved for temporal analysis.

---

### **Coherent Narrative:**
The event log represents a user's workflow involving:
1. Editing **Document1.docx** and saving changes.
2. Switching to **Google Chrome** to review and reply to an email.
3. Switching to **Adobe Acrobat** to review a **Report_Draft.pdf**.
4. Switching to **Microsoft Excel** to update a **Budget_2024.xlsx**.
5. Returning to **Microsoft Word** to reference the budget in **Document1.docx**.
6. Finally, working on a **Quarterly_Report.docx** and saving it.

This structured log provides a clear, analyst-friendly representation of the user's workflow, suitable for process discovery, conformance checking, or performance analysis.
