Okay, let's tackle this problem. We need to group these events into separate cases, which represent different patients' journeys through the hospital. Since there are no explicit case IDs, I have to look at the attributes given and see how they can form a coherent sequence for each patient.

First, I'll list all the events and see which attributes can help. The key attributes are the patient's age and gender, department, activity sequence, and timestamps. Since each patient's case should have a unique combination of age and gender, that might be a start, but there could be duplicates. Let me check if any age and gender pairs repeat. 

Looking at the events:

- Event1: 45M (ER)
- Event2: 62F (ER)
- Event3: 28M (Surgery)
- The rest follow based on these.

From the first three registration events, the patients have distinct age and gender combinations. Let's see if these attributes stay consistent through subsequent events. 

Starting with the first patient (45M, ER):

Event1 is their registration. Then, Event4 is Initial triage in ER, same age and gender. Then Event7 (X-ray in Radiology) matches. Event12 is a doctor consultation in ER, same age and gender. Then Event15 is discharge in ER. So that's a sequence.

Second patient (62F, ER):

Event2 registration. Then Event5 (triage in ER, but wait, Event5's patient is 62F? Wait, looking at Event4 and 5. Wait, let me check:

Wait, Event4 is triage for 45M (ER), which matches Event1. Event5 is triage for 62F (ER), matching Event2. Then Event8 is Lab test requested by Dr. Smith for 62F (ER), then Event11 is diagnosis by Dr. Smith again, and Event14 is prescription, then discharge in ER at Event17. So that's another case.

Third patient is 28M in Surgery:

Event3 is registration in Surgery. Then Event6 is a doctor consult in Surgery? Wait, no. Looking at Event6: activity is Doctor consultation but in ER. Wait, no. Wait, Event6 is activity: Doctor consultation, department: Surgery? Wait, let me check each event again carefully.

Looking again:

Event6: timestamp 08:15:42, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient 28M. Wait, no, the department here is Surgery, right? Let me confirm:

Event6's department is Surgery? Let me check the original list.

Looking back at event6: "department: ER" or Surgery?

Wait, let me check each event again carefully. The user provided events 1 to 18. Let me list them again properly:

Event6: "activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age:28, M, additional: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery". Yes, department is Surgery. Wait, looking at the user's input:

Event6: "department: Surgery" (because event3 is registration in Surgery, so the next events related to that patient would be in Surgery. Let me confirm.

Looking at the user's input:

Event6: 

"6. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: body_part=left_leg  
Wait no, wait, let me check again carefully:

Wait, I might have miscalculated. Let me go step by step.

Wait, here's the user's list again:

The events provided are:

1. Reg patient (45M, ER)
2. Reg (62F, ER)
3. Reg (28M, Surgery)
4. Initial triage (45M, ER)
5. Initial triage (62F, ER)
6. Doctor consultation (28M, Surgery) – because the third registration was in Surgery, so this must be the next step for the 28M in Surgery.

Wait, let's go through each event again step by step to avoid confusion:

Event1: Reg 45M, ER.

Event2: Reg 62F, ER.

Event3: Reg 28M, Surgery.

Event4: Triage 45M, ER. That's the same as event1's patient.

Event5: Triage 62F, ER. Same as event2's patient.

Event6: activity: Doctor consultation, resource Dr. Lee, department Surgery, patient 28M. So this is the surgery patient from event3.

Event7: X-ray imaging for 45M (ER), so that's the first patient.

Event8: Lab test requested by Dr. Smith in ER for 62F (event2's patient). So that's the second patient.

Event9: Surgery prep for 28M (Surgery department). So that's the third patient's event.

Event10: Lab test completed for 62F, matches their case.

Event11: Doctor consult for 62F (diagnosis), same as before.

Event12: Doctor consult for 45M in ER (diagnosis).

Event13: Surgery performed by Dr. Lee in Surgery for 28M.

Event14: Prescription for 62F in ER.

Event15: Discharge for 45M in ER.

Event16: Recovery room for 28M in Surgery.

Event17: Discharge for 62F in ER.

Event18: Discharge for 28M in Surgery.

So each patient has their own unique age and gender. Since the ages are all different (45, 62, 28), that's a good starting point. Let me check for any duplicates. Since all three have different ages, their cases can be separated by patient_age and gender. Let me confirm:

Patient 1: 45M, ER. Events:

1 (Reg), 4 (triage),7 (X-ray), 12 (doc consult), 15 (discharge). Wait, but event12 is at 08:23:10, and the discharge is event15. Then between those, maybe some other activities? Let me list all events for patient1 (45M, M):

Looking for all events with 45M:

Events 1 (Reg),4 (triage),7 (X-ray),12 (doc consult),15 (discharge). Then maybe others? Let's see:

Looking through all events:

Event1: 45M

Event4: same.

Event7:45M, yes.

Event12: 45M, yes.

Event15: discharge, yes.

That's four events. The discharge is the last one for them.

Patient2: 62F, ER.

Events 2 (Reg),5 (triage),8 (Lab req),10 (Lab result), 11 (doc consult),14 (prescription),17 (discharge). 

Patient3:28M, Surgery.

Events:3 (Reg),6 (doc consult),9 (surgery prep),13 (surgery performed),16 (recovery),18 (discharge). 

Wait, event6 is activity: Doctor consultation for 28M in Surgery (event6? Wait, the user's event6 says:

Looking back, event6 is:

"6. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: body_part=left_leg"

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread some of the events. Let me recheck each event's attributes to avoid confusion. Let me parse each event's attributes properly.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in assigning events to patients because of misreading the data. Let me go through each event one by one, noting the patient_age and gender.

Let me list all events with all their attributes for clarity:

1. Reg 45M ER
2. Reg 62F ER
3. Reg 28M Surgery
4. Triage 45M ER
5. Triage 62F ER
6. X-ray imaging for 45M (Radiology). Wait, here's a mistake. Wait, event6 is:

Wait the user's event6 says:

"6. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: body_part=left_leg"

Ah! Wait, so event6 is for 45M. Wait, but then that would mean the 45M patient has an X-ray at event6, but the triage was event4, then X-ray at 6, then maybe Doctor consultation at event12?

Wait, but in my previous thought I thought event6 was for the 28M, but that's a mistake. Because the actual data shows event6's patient is 45M. Let me correct this.

This is critical. So, I must list all events correctly by their attributes.

Let me re-express all events with their patient details:

1. Reg 45M, ER
2. Reg 62F, ER
3. Reg 28M, Surgery
4. Triage 45M, ER
5. Triage 62F, ER
6. X-ray (45M, Radiology)
7. Activity? Let me check event7:

Event7: "7. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: body_part=left_leg"

Wait, so event6 and 7 are same patient (45M)? Wait, no, event6 is timestamp 08:15:42, and event7 is same? Wait no, let me check the timestamps again:

Wait, looking at the data provided:

Looking at the user's input:

Event6's timestamp is 08:15:42, and event7 is next line. Wait, the user's list:

The user's events are:

After event5 (triage 62F at 08:12:29), the next is:

6. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, ... patient 45M.

Wait, but the next event after that is event6 is the X-ray for 45M. Then event7 is next? Wait, perhaps a typo in the user's list? Let me check the actual list again carefully.

Wait the user's events:

Looking at the user's numbered list:

6. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: body_part=left_leg

Wait, so event6 is for 45M.

Then event7 is:

"7. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, activity: Lab test requested, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: test_type=blood_panel"

Wait, no, actually, let me recheck the user's input:

Wait the user's list is as follows. Let me parse each line correctly:

Looking at the user's input:

Event 6: 

6. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: body_part=left_leg  

Wait, that's correct. So patient 45M's events include event6.

Then event7 is:

7. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, activity: Lab test requested, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: test_type=blood_panel  

So that's patient2 (62F).

Event8: 

8. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery  

Ah, so this is the 28M patient (third patient).

Then event9: 

9. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, activity: Lab test completed, resource: Lab Technician, department: Laboratory, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: results=normal_levels  

Wait, no, event9's activity is "Lab test completed"? Wait, looking back:

Wait the user's event8 is:

"8. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery"

Event9: 

Wait, the user's events continue. Let me parse each line correctly. Let me list all events with their patient details:

1. 45M (ER)
2. 62F (ER)
3. 28M (Surgery)
4. 45M (ER)
5.62F (ER)
6. 45M (Radiology)
7. 62F (ER, lab test requested)
8. 28M (Surgery, doctor consult)
9. Let me check event9:

Looking at the user's list, after event8 comes event9:

"9. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, activity: Lab test completed, resource: Lab Technician, department: Laboratory, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: results=normal_levels" 

Wait, that's for 62F.

Wait, proceeding step by step:

Event9 is for 62F (62F, ER patient).

Event10:

"10. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection"

Yes, that's patient2.

Event11:

"11. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture"  45M.

Event12: 

"12. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture"  that's patient1.

Wait, no, the user's events:

Wait the user's actual event numbers:

Wait the user's events:

Wait I might have misassigned some events. Let me re-express all 18 events with their attributes properly:

Event1: Reg 45M ER

Event2: Reg 62F ER

Event3: Reg 28M Surgery

Event4: Triage 45M ER

Event5: Triage 62F ER

Event6: X-ray (45M, Radiology)

Event7: Lab test requested (62F, ER, by Dr. Smith)

Event8: Doctor consult (28M, Surgery, Dr. Lee, reason surgery)

Event9: Lab test completed (62F)

Event10: Doctor consultation by Dr. Smith for 62F (diagnosis)

Wait, event8 is for 28M (Surgery), and event9 is lab completed for 62F.

Event10: "10. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection"  that's patient2.

Event11: "11. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture"  patient1.

Event12: "12. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, ...  yes, patient1.

Event13: "13. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, activity: Surgery performed, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: procedure=arthroscopy"

That's patient3 (28M).

Event14: "14. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, activity: Prescription created, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: medication=antibiotics.

Yes, patient2.

Event15: Discharge for 45M (patient1).

Event16: Recovery room for 28M (Surgery).

Event17: Discharge 62F (ER).

Event18: Discharge 28M (Surgery).

Wait, okay, so the 28M patient's events are the third patient. Let's now list each patient's events.

Patient1: 45M, ER case:

Events:

1 (Reg), 4 (triage),6 (X-ray), 11 (doc consult), 12 (another doc consult?), wait let me list all events for patient1 (45M):

Looking for all events with 45M:

Event1,4,6,11,12,15 (discharge).

Wait, event11 is a doctor consultation at ER, which would be theirs.

Event12 is same as event11? Wait, the timestamps are:

Event6: X-ray (45M)

Event11 is at 08:23:10: Doctor consult for 45M (ER), diagnosis.

Event12 is the same as event11? Wait, the user's event numbering:

Wait the user's events are numbered 1-18, so let me recheck each event's patient details.

Wait let me list each event's patient attributes:

1. 45M
2. 62F
3.28M (Surgery)
4.45M
5.62F
6.45M (X-ray)
7.62F (Lab requested by Dr. Smith)
8.28M (Surgery's doc consult)
9.62F (Lab completed)
10. 62F (doctor consult)
11.45M (doc consult in ER, diagnosis)
12. same as 11? Wait, looking at the data:

Event 11 says:

"11. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture"  yes.

Event12 is next:

Wait, event12 is number 12: "timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection"  Wait, no, event10 is that.

Wait, perhaps I need to list each event's patient details step by step to avoid confusion. Let me make a table:

Event | patient_age | patient_gender | department | activity

1: 45 M ER  Reg

2:62 F ER  Reg

3:28 M Surgery  Reg

4:45 M ER  Triage

5:62 F ER  Triage

6:45 M Radiology  X-ray

7:62 F ER  Lab test requested (event7 is 62F?)

Wait, event7's patient is 62F? Let me check each:

Event7: 

"7. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, activity: Lab test requested, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: test_type=blood_panel"  yes.

Event8:

"8. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery"  28M (third patient).

Event9:

"9. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, activity: Lab test completed, resource: Lab Technician, department: Laboratory, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: results=normal_levels"  patient2.

Event10:

"10. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection"  patient2.

Event11:

"11. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture"  patient1.

Event12: 

Wait, the numbering continues, so after 11 comes 12:

"12. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture" – but that's same as event11? Wait that's a possible typo, but assuming the data is correct.

Wait, perhaps the user's events are:

Wait the user's 12th event is:

"12. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture"

Yes, so that's patient1.

Event13:

"13. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, activity: Surgery performed, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: procedure=arthroscopy"  patient3.

Event14: "14. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, activity: Prescription created, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: medication=antibiotics.

Event15: Discharge 45M (ER)

Event16: Recovery room 28M (Surgery)

Event17: Discharge 62F (ER)

Event18: Discharge 28M (Surgery).

So the three patients are distinct by age/gender:

Patient1: 45M (ER)

Patient2:62F (ER)

Patient3:28M (Surgery)

So each patient has a unique age and gender combo. Thus, all events with same age and gender belong to the same case.

Therefore, each case is grouped by patient_age and gender.

So the cases are:

Case1 (45M):

Events: 1 (reg), 4 (triage), 6 (X-ray), 11 (doc consult),12 (another doc consult?), wait, event6 is X-ray, then event11 and 12 are consultations. Wait, but let's list all events for 45M:

Check each event for 45M:

Events where patient_age=45 and gender M:

Event1 (reg), ER)

Event4 (triage ER)

Event6 (X-ray, Radiology)

Event11 (doc consult ER, diagnosis)

Event12: same as above? Wait, event12's details:

Wait event12 is:

"12. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age:45, M: diagnosis=hairline_fracture  yes.

Then event12 is part of patient1.

Then their discharge is event15 (ER discharge).

So patient1's events are 1,4,6,11,12,15.

Wait, but event12 might be the same as event11? Wait, no, their timestamps are 08:22:54 (event10?), maybe I need to list all events for each patient:

Patient1 (45M):

- 1 (reg)

-4 (triage)

-6 (X-ray)

-11 (doc consult)

-12 (another doc consult?) Wait, perhaps there are two doctor consultations? Or maybe event12 is an error, but assuming the data is correct.

Wait, perhaps the events for patient1 (45M):

Events: 1,4,6, 11,12,15 (discharge).

Wait, event6 (X-ray at 08:15:42), then event7 is lab for 62F.

Then, event11 is at 08:23:10, so after the X-ray.

Patient2 (62F):

Events:2 (reg), ER),5 (triage),7 (lab request),9 (lab result),10 (doc consult,14 (prescription),17 (discharge).

Patient3 (28M):

3 (reg, Surgery),8 (doc consult),9? No, event8 is their's:

Wait, event8:

"8. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery"

Yes, so event8 is part of patient3's case.

Then event9 is for 62F (patient2).

Event13 is surgery performed (patient3).

Event16 (Recovery room for 28M), then discharge18.

So for patient3: events3 (reg), 8 (doc consult),9? No, event8 is theirs, then event13 (surgery), then 16 (recovery), 18 (discharge).

Wait, let me list all events for each:

Patient1 (45M):

- 1 (reg)

-4 (triage)

-6 (X-ray)

-11 (doc consult)

-12 (another doc consult?)

Wait, event12 is the diagnosis for 45M, so that's part of their case.

Then discharge at 15.

Patient2 (62F):

-2 (reg)

-5 (triage)

-7 (lab request)

-9 (lab results)

-10 (doc consult)

-14 (prescription)

-17 (discharge)

Patient3 (28M):

-3 (reg)

-8 (doc consult)

-9? No, event9 is 62F.

Event13 (surgery performed)

Event16 (recovery room)

Event18 (discharge).

Wait, so for patient3:

Event3 (reg)

Event8 (doc consult in Surgery department.

Then event9 is 62F, so patient3's next events after registration (3):

Event8 (doc consult in Surgery)

Then Event9 is patient2's.

Event13: surgery performed (28M)

Event16: recovery room (Surgery department)

Event18: discharge from Surgery.

So, events for patient3:

3 (reg), surgery)

8 (doc consult),

then event13 (surgery)

then event16 (recovery),

event18 (discharge).

Any other events?

Event9 is for patient2 (62F).

Event10 is patient2's doc consult.

Wait, so the three cases are indeed separated by age and gender. Each patient has unique age and gender, so all events with those attributes are part of their case.

Therefore, the grouping is straightforward: each patient's case is all events with their age and gender. Since all three have unique age/gender pairs, this should work.

Thus, the cases are:

Case1: All events with 45M  events 1,4,6,11,12,15.

Case2: 62F  events2,5,7,9,10,14,17.

Case3:28M  3,8,13,16,18.

Wait, but need to check if there are other events. Let me count all events in each case:

Case1 (45M):

1. Reg (ER)

4. Triage (Er)

6. X-ray (Radiology)

11. Doctor consult (Er)

12. Doctor consult (Er again? Wait, event12 is at 08:23:10Z, which is after the X-ray. So that's okay. Then discharge at event15.

So that's 1,4,6,11,12,15.

Wait, event12's timestamp is before event11? Wait event11 is at 08:22:54 (event10? Wait the timestamps:

Looking at the timestamps:

Event11's timestamp is 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z (event11), patient1's doc consult.

Event12's timestamp is 08:23:10Z? Wait, perhaps a typo, but assuming the data is correct, the order might have same time for event11 and 12? Maybe close times but different activities.

Anyway, the sequence makes sense as:

Patient1's events in order:

1 (reg at 08:05),

4 (triage at 08:10:50),

then event6 (X-ray at 08:15:42),

then maybe 11 and 12 are two doctor consultations? Or maybe a typo. But regardless, all events with 45M are in case1.

Similarly for others.

Therefore, the grouping is simply based on patient_age and patient_gender.

Thus, the answer would group all events with the same age/gender into the same case.

So the cases are:

Case1: All events with 45M  events 1,4,6,11,12,15.

Case2: 62F  events2,5,7,9,10,14,17.

Case3:28M  events3,8,13,16,18.

Wait let me confirm all events:

Total events: 18.

Case1: 6 events (1,4,6,11,12,15  6 events)

Case2: events2,5,7 (event7?), 9,10,14,17  total 7 events (2,5,7,9,10,14,17).

Case3: events3,8,13,16,18  5 events.

Total 6+7+5=18, so all accounted for.

Therefore, the cases are separated by age and gender, which are unique for each patient.

Therefore, the case groupings are based on the unique patient_age and patient_gender pairs.

Thus, the answer is that each case is determined by the patient's age and gender. The three cases are:

Case1 (45M): events 1,4,6,11,12,15.

Case2 (62F: events2,5,7,9,10,14,17.

Case3 (28M: events3,8,13,16,18.

Therefore, the grouping is straightforward with unique age/gender pairs.

The events can be grouped into three distinct cases based on the unique combinations of **patient_age** and **patient_gender**, as these attributes uniquely identify each patient. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Case 1 (Patient: 45-year-old Male - ER Patient)**
**Events:**  
1 (Registration), ER), 08:05:13), Admin Clerk)  
4 (Initial triage, ER, 08:10:50, Nurse Joy)  
6 (X-ray imaging, Radiology, 08:15:42, Radiology Tech)  
11 (Doctor consultation, ER, 08:22:54, Dr. Lee)  
12 (Second doctor consultation, ER, 08:23:10, Dr. Lee)  
15 (Discharge, ER, 08:30:05, Ward Clerk)

### **Case 2 (Patient: 62 year-old Female - ER Patient)**
**Events:**  
2 (Registration, ER, 08:07:02, Admin Clerk)  
5 (Initial triage, ER, 08:12:29, Nurse Mark)  
7 (Lab test requested, ER, 08:16:10, Dr. Smith)  
9 (Lab test completed, Laboratory, 08:20:27, Lab Technician)  
10 (Doctor consultation, ER, 08:22:54, Dr. Smith)  
14 (Prescription, ER, 08:27:00, Dr. Smith)  
17 (Discharge, ER, 08:35:29, Ward Clerk)

### **Case 3 (Patient: 28 year-old Male - Surgery Patient)**
**Events:**  
3 (Registration, Surgery, 08:07:15, Admin Clerk)  
8 (Doctor consultation, Surgery, 08:16:45, Dr. Lee)  
13 (Surgery performed, Surgery, 08:25:19, Dr. Lee)  
16 (Recovery room, Surgery, 08:31:37, Recovery Nurse)  
18 (Discharge, Surgery, 08:40:13, Ward Clerk)

### Key Rationale:
- **Unique Age-Genders:** The three patients have distinct age-gender pairs (45M, 62F, 28M), ensuring no overlap.  
- **Logical Workflow:**  
  - **Case 1 (ER Patient):** Follows ER flow (Registration  Triage  Imaging  Diagnosis  Discharge).  
  - **Case 2 (ER Patient):** Follows ER flow with lab tests and prescriptions.  
  - **Case 3 (Surgery Patient):** Follows surgical flow (Registration  Consult  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge).  

- **Timestamps:** Events are temporally consistent within each case (e.g., discharge events occur after all treatments).  
- **Departments:** Activities align with their initial registration department (e.g., the surgery
