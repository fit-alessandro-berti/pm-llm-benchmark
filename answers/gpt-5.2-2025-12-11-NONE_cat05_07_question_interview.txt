1. **Trigger and intake**
   - What are the most common ways a landlord initiates the onboarding request (phone, web form, referral, email), and what information is captured at first contact?
   - What determines whether the request is handled by a regional office versus a central team?
   - What does “onboarding start” mean internally—when the landlord first contacts you, or when a complete document package is received?

2. **Documentation requirements and verification**
   - What is the standard checklist of required documents, and how does it vary by city/property type?
   - Who is the source of truth for whether a document is “valid” (coordinator judgment, legal/compliance rules, city database, third-party verification)?
   - How do you handle documents that are technically present but questionable (expired soon, inconsistent names/addresses, conflicting inspection results)?
   - What are the typical back-and-forth loops for missing/outdated documents, and at what point do you pause or close the onboarding?

3. **Property data capture**
   - What property attributes are mandatory versus optional when entering it into the central database?
   - How do you validate critical fields like unit count, ownership entity, address normalization, and amenity claims?
   - If the landlord provides estimated information (e.g., square footage), when/how is it confirmed?

4. **Roles and ownership across the process**
   - Can you map which roles “own” each major stage (coordinator, property manager, leasing agent, marketing, inspector, compliance, finance, IT)?
   - Where do handoffs most commonly fail or require rework, and why?
   - Who is ultimately accountable for an onboarding being “complete” and ready to rent?

5. **Property manager assignment logic**
   - How is workload measured for assignment (unit count, active tenants, open maintenance tickets, geographic spread, complexity score)?
   - What are the tie-breakers when multiple managers fit (performance metrics, landlord preference, language, relationship history)?
   - How do you handle urgent onboarding requests when the best-fit manager is at capacity?

6. **Landlord kickoff / expectation alignment**
   - What is the agenda for the introductory call/meeting, and what decisions must be made by the end of it?
   - Which policies are standardized company-wide versus negotiated case-by-case (pets, maintenance responsibilities, payment channels, lease terms)?
   - How do you document and confirm the outcome of that meeting so all teams work from the same assumptions?

7. **Inspection and photography scheduling**
   - What dictates the order—inspection first, photos first, or parallel—and why?
   - Who schedules these visits, and how do you coordinate access (landlord, tenants if occupied, lockbox, onsite staff)?
   - What service-level expectations exist for scheduling lead time and turnaround (e.g., inspection report delivery time)?

8. **Inspection outcomes and remediation**
   - What are the most common inspection failure categories, and which are “must-fix” versus “advisory”?
   - Who decides whether remediation is required before listing versus after a tenant is secured?
   - When contractors are involved, who selects them, who approves quotes, and who pays/how is it tracked?
   - What happens if a landlord refuses repairs or disputes the inspector’s findings?

9. **Marketing preparation and pricing**
   - What inputs are used to set the initial rent range (market comps, internal pricing models, manager judgment, landlord expectations)?
   - Who has final authority on pricing when the landlord wants a price outside the recommended range?
   - What is the standard marketing package (listing sites, brochure formats, minimum photo set), and when are exceptions allowed?
   - How do you handle properties with restrictions that affect marketing (HOA rules, fair housing constraints, local advertising regulations)?

10. **“Activation” definition and readiness**
   - What exact criteria must be met for a property to be considered “activated” in systems (docs complete, inspection pass, photos, pricing approval, listing copy approved)?
   - Are there different activation levels (internal-only vs public listing; accepting inquiries vs accepting applications)?
   - Who approves activation, and what checks happen right before it goes live?

11. **Leasing workflow and tenant screening**
   - Who runs screening versus who makes the final tenant selection (leasing agent, property manager, landlord, centralized screening team)?
   - What are your screening standards (credit thresholds, income multiples, reference requirements), and how do they vary by market or property type?
   - How do you handle borderline applicants, co-signers, guarantors, roommates, or applicants with nontraditional income?
   - What is the workflow when multiple qualified applicants apply—first-qualified, best-qualified, lottery, landlord choice, negotiated terms?

12. **Negotiation and lease terms**
   - What lease terms are negotiable (rent, move-in date, lease length, pet fees, utilities, furnishings), and what is non-negotiable?
   - Who can approve concessions/discounts, and what limits or approval hierarchy exists?
   - How do you ensure negotiated terms are reflected consistently in the final lease and in internal records?

13. **Deposits, payments, and move-in coordination**
   - When are security deposits and first payments collected (upon approval, upon signing, before move-in), and what payment methods are supported?
   - What happens if a tenant is approved but delays signing or payment—do you hold the unit, and for how long?
   - Who coordinates move-in logistics (keys, access codes, walk-through condition report), and what “move-in ready” standard must be met?

14. **Compliance, audit, and internal approvals**
   - At what points do compliance, finance, and IT reviews occur—parallel or sequential—and what triggers each review?
   - What are the most common compliance issues found in lease review (fair housing, local disclosures, custom clauses)?
   - How do finance teams validate profitability targets—what metrics are they checking, and what happens if the deal fails those targets?
   - What does IT specifically validate regarding integration, and how are integration errors detected and resolved?

15. **Exceptions and special cases**
   - What are the most frequent exceptions (special insurance, custom lease clauses, occupied units, short-term rentals, student housing), and how are they routed?
   - How do you handle properties that are occupied during onboarding—do you list immediately, wait until vacancy, or run a different track?
   - What’s the process when the landlord is an entity with complex ownership or requires additional due diligence?

16. **Communication and documentation practices**
   - Where is the “single source of truth” for status and decisions—CRM, project tool, email—and how do you prevent information fragmentation?
   - What are your standard communication touchpoints with the landlord (status updates cadence, templates, escalation contacts)?
   - How are decisions, approvals, and policy exceptions recorded so future team members can rely on them?

17. **Timing, throughput, and bottlenecks**
   - What is the typical end-to-end timeline from first contact to lease signed, and what are the main drivers of variability?
   - Which steps are most often the bottleneck (docs, inspection, repairs, marketing production, screening), and how do you mitigate delays?
   - Do you track cycle time or SLA targets by stage, and how do teams react when targets are missed?

18. **Quality control and success metrics**
   - What does “good onboarding” mean to you—fewer post-move-in issues, faster leasing, higher tenant quality, landlord satisfaction?
   - What are the most common errors found in audits (data entry, pricing, lease clauses, listing content), and how are they prevented?
   - How do you capture feedback from landlords/tenants after onboarding, and how does it feed into process improvement?

19. **Escalations and governance**
   - What issues trigger escalation, and who is empowered to make final decisions (regional lead, compliance head, legal, finance)?

20. **Process variations across regions**
   - Which parts of the process are standardized across all cities, and which are localized due to regulations or market norms?
   - How do you maintain consistency when tools, vendors (inspectors/photographers), and regulations differ by region?
