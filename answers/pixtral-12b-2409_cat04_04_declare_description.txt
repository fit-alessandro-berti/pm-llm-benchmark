Based on the provided declarative process model constraints, we can infer the underlying process as follows:

### Process Overview
The process appears to involve several activities related to the handling of a declaration, payment requests, and payment handling. The activities are performed by different roles such as EMPLOYEE, SUPERVISOR, and potentially others. The constraints indicate specific rules and sequences that must be followed during the process.

### Key Activities
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
3. **Request Payment**
4. **Payment Handled**

### Constraints and Their Implications

1. **Initialization: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
   - The process always starts with the declaration being submitted by the employee.

2. **Existence: Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment, Payment Handled, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
   - Each of these activities must occur at least once in the process.

3. **Exactly 1: Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment, Payment Handled, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
   - Each of these activities must occur exactly once in the process.

4. **Absence: Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**
   - The process does not include these activities.

5. **Responded Existence: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Payment Handled', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')**
   - If certain activities occur, others must occur. For example, if 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur.

6. **Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')**
   - If certain activities occur, others must have occurred previously. For example, 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must occur after 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.

7. **Succession: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')**
   - If certain activities occur, others must occur later. For example, if 'Request Payment' occurs, 'Payment Handled' must occur later.

### Summary of the Process
1. **Start**: The process begins with the employee submitting a declaration.
2. **Approval**: The declaration is then finalized and approved by the supervisor.
3. **Payment Request**: The employee requests payment.
4. **Payment Handling**: Payment is handled.

### Sequence of Events
Given the constraints, a possible sequence of activities can be inferred as:
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
3. **Request Payment**
4. **Payment Handled**

This sequence respects all the constraints provided, ensuring that each activity occurs exactly once, in the specified order, and without any forbidden activities.
