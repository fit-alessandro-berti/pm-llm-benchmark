Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative rules and the desiderata. The normative rules are strict, so any violation here is a serious issue. The desiderata are just recommendations, so they're not as critical but still important to note.

Starting with the event logs for each case:

**Case 1:**
Looking at the activities, the sequence seems correct. Starts with Application Received, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. The order follows the required sequence. For the approved case, they finalized docs before closing. No steps skipped or reversed. So probably no normative violation here. But check the desiderata: The Credit Check was done 30 minutes after application, which is within 24 hours. Informing applicant was done 2 hours after decision, which is under 48 hours. Also, there's no Follow-up Call, but that's just a desideratum. So Case 1 might not have desiderata issues except maybe the Follow-up Call missing.

**Case 2:**
First activity is Application Received. Next is Risk Assessment, but there's no prior Credit Check. That's a clear violation of the normative rule because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then Credit Check is done after Risk Assessment, which is reversing the order. Then Loan Decision (Rejected), but after that, they Finalize Documentation, which isn't allowed for rejections. Then Close Case. So two normative violations here: order of Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and Finalize Doc after rejection. So definitely Case 2 violates norms.

**Case 3:**
Application Received, then Credit Check happened on the 14th, which is 4 days later (from 12th 09:00 to 14th 10:00? Wait, the dates are 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00. That's two days later, which is 48 hours plus. The desideratum says Credit Check should be within 24 hours, so this is a violation. Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved). Inform Applicant was done on 16th 15:00. The Loan Decision was on 14th 12:00. So the time between decision and inform is 2 days and 3 hours, which is way over 48 hours. Another desideratum violation. Finalize Doc and Close Case followed. Also, no Follow-up Call, which is another desideratum. But normative sequence: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform  Finalize  Close. All steps in order. Approved loan followed the correct path. So no normative violations here, only desiderata issues.

So summarizing:

1. Normative Violations:
   - Case 2: Risk Assessment before Credit Check, Finalize Documentation after rejection.
   
2. Desiderata Violations:
   - Case 1: Missing Follow-up Call.
   - Case 3: Credit Check took more than 24h, Inform Applicant took more than 48h, missing Follow-up Call.

Possible justifications:
For Case 2, maybe the system had an error causing activities to be logged out of order, or the user made a mistake in entering data. For Case 3, perhaps delays were due to weekends or high workload, but they followed the required steps. The missing Follow-up Calls might be skipped due to oversight or resource constraints, which is acceptable since it's not mandatory.

**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

- **Case 2** violates the normative rules:
  - **Reason 1:** Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check (reverse order), violating the sequence constraint.
  - **Reason 2:** Finalize Documentation was performed after a Loan Decision (Rejected), which is strictly prohibited.

- **Cases 1 & 3** comply with normative rules.

**2. Desiderata Violations:**

- **Case 1:**
  - Missing Follow-up Call (recommended but not required).

- **Case 3:**
  - Credit Check delayed beyond 24 hours (48+ hours after application).
  - Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48 hours (2 days after decision).
  - Missing Follow-up Call.

- **Case 2** has no desiderata violations to note (its issues are purely normative breaches).

**3. Justifications/Interpretations:**

- **Case 1:** Likely followed best practices except for the Follow-up Call, which might have been skipped due to oversight or efficiency (not mandatory).
- **Case 2:** Possibly a system error or human mistake in activity logging/order. The rejection followed by documentation finalization suggests confusion between approval/rejection workflows.
- **Case 3:** Delays may stem from resource constraints, weekends, or high workload, but the core process integrity was maintained. Missing Follow-up Call indicates potential prioritization of speed over optional alignment checks.
