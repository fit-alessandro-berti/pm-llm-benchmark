Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group:

1. **Screening Process:**
   - The protected group has more extensive screening processes compared to the unprotected group. This is evident from the higher frequency of process variants that include "Extensive Screening" in their workflow (793 vs 1022 for initial screening, and additional extensive screenings before contract signing).
   - The protected group also has a higher frequency of tenant rejection after extensive screening (793 vs 1022), suggesting a more rigorous vetting process.

2. **Contract Signing and Move-In:**
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of direct contract signing and move-in processes without extensive screening before signing the contract (e.g., 268, 223, 156, etc.).
   - In contrast, the protected group has fewer instances of direct contract signing and move-in, indicating that they are more likely to undergo additional checks before finalizing the process.

3. **Tenant Cancellation:**
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of tenant cancellation after paying rent for varying periods (e.g., 268, 223, 156, etc.).
   - The protected group, on the other hand, has fewer instances of tenant cancellations and tends to have longer rental periods before cancellation (e.g., 29, 23, 18, etc.).

4. **Eviction Process:**
   - The protected group has a process variant that includes an 'Issue Warning' step before eviction (frequency = 6), suggesting a more formal and structured approach to dealing with rent defaults.
   - This step is not present in the unprotected group's process variants.

5. **Performance Metrics:**
   - The performance metric for the protected group is higher than that of the unprotected group, indicating longer processing times or higher resource allocation for each process variant (average performance: 704,139.68 vs 525,007.27).

These differences suggest that the 'protected' group is subject to more rigorous and time-consuming processes throughout their tenancy journey compared to the 'unprotected' group. This could be due to various reasons such as risk assessment, compliance with regulations, or specific requirements related to the protected status of this group.
