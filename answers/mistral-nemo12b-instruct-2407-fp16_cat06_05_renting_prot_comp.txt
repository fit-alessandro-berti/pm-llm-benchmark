Based on the provided data, I'll analyze the main differences between these tenant journeys focusing on key steps that impact frequency and performance (assumed to be total rent collected). Here are the significant variations:

1. **Screening Process:**
   - *Standard Screening:* Most paths follow a standard screening process after checking paperwork. This includes activities like verifying employment, rental history, credit checks, etc.
     - Frequency: 223 to 84 (highest to lowest)
     - Performance: ~719K to ~1M (lowest to highest)

   - *Extensive Screening:* Two paths include an 'extensive screening' step after checking paperwork. This could involve more rigorous background checks, income verification, or additional reference checks.
     - Frequency: 88 and 63
     - Performance: ~800K to ~880K (lower than the standard screening paths with similar frequency)

2. **Number of Rent Payments Before Cancellation:**
   - Paths vary in the number of rent payments made before a tenant cancels their apartment lease:
     - 1 payment: 2 paths (frequency = 43 & 44, performance ~960K to ~1.1M)
     - 2 payments: 2 paths (frequency = 88 & 63, performance ~800K to ~880K, extensive screening included)
     - 3 payments: 5 paths (frequency = 156 to 56, performance ~719K to ~1.2M)
     - 4 payments or more: 3 paths (frequency = 128 to 52, performance ~880K to ~1.28M)

   The higher number of rent payments correlates with better performance, suggesting that tenants who stay longer contribute more to total collected rent.

3. **Contract Signing and Move-In Sequence:**
   - In all paths, after screening, the tenant signs a contract and moves in before starting to pay rent.
   - However, some paths show slight variations in the sequence of these steps:
     - Some include 'Hand In The Paperwork' and 'Check Paperwork' before signing the contract (most common).
     - A few combine 'Move In -> Pay Rent' into a single step ('Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent'), reducing the number of distinct steps.

4. **Appointment Setting and Viewing:**
   - All paths start with 'Apply for Viewing Appointment' and 'Set Appointment'.
   - 'View The Property' is consistently present after setting an appointment.
   - There are no significant differences in these initial stages, suggesting they don't greatly impact frequency or performance.

The main differences lie in the screening process (standard vs. extensive), the number of rent payments before cancellation, and minor variations in the sequence of contract signing and move-in steps. These factors can influence both the frequency of tenant journeys and the total rent collected (performance).
