### Cases Violating the Normative Process:

Upon reviewing the event log against the normative process description, the following cases deviate from the expected process flow:

1. **Case 2**
2. **Case 3**

### Violations Explanation:

#### Case 2:

- **Violation:** The sequence of activities violates the rule that "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging. Specifically, in Case 2, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
- **Reference to Normative Process:** The normative description clearly states that after confirming inventory, payment authorization should occur before packaging items.
- **Interpretation:** This deviation indicates a misunderstanding of the required sequence, potentially leading to unauthorized payments or packaging of items before payment verification.

#### Case 3:

- **Violation:** The case violates two critical rules:
  1. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order", which contradicts the logic that shipping should never occur after cancellation.
  2. The sequence ignores the principle that "Close order" should follow all other activities logically, particularly in the context of cancellation and fulfillment.
- **Reference to Normative Process:** The description specifies that if an order is canceled, it should proceed to be closed without any further fulfillment activities like shipping.
- **Interpretation:** This case suggests a severe deviation from the expected process, indicating either a procedural error in handling cancellations or a systematic misunderstanding of how to finalize orders appropriately.

### Cases Not Violating the Normative Process:

1. **Case 1:** Follows the exact sequence outlined for orders with sufficient inventory.
2. **Case 4:** Correctly handles the cancellation scenario and does not proceed with fulfillment activities after cancellation.
3. **Case 5:** Although missing the "Package items" activity before shipping, the core sequence and logic (Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close) generally adhere to the normative process for orders with sufficient inventory. However, this simplification might not strictly follow the detailed process flow that includes packaging, indicating a minor deviation but not as critical as those in Cases 2 and 3.

### Overall:

The analysis highlights two cases (2 and 3) that significantly deviate from the normative process described. These deviations indicate potential procedural mistakes or misunderstandings of the process's logical flow, particularly around payment authorization, packaging, and order cancellation and shipping. Addressing these violations is crucial to ensure the orders are handled according to the established normative process, which is designed to ensure efficiency, customer satisfaction, and logical flow of actions based on the availability of inventory.
