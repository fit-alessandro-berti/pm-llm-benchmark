# Clarifying Questions for the Property Onboarding Process

## Documentation & Initial Review

1. When a landlord first contacts the regional office, is there a standardized checklist of required documents they are given upfront, or does the property coordinator determine what is needed on a case-by-case basis? How does that initial guidance get communicated to the landlord?

2. You mentioned the coordinator requests updates if documents are missing or outdated — what happens if a landlord is slow to respond or repeatedly submits incomplete documentation? Is there a defined escalation path or a point at which the request is abandoned?

3. How do you define "outdated" for documents like inspection reports or certificates of compliance? Is there a standard expiration window that applies uniformly, or does it vary by document type, city, or local regulation?

4. Once the property details are recorded into the central database, who is responsible for verifying the accuracy of that data entry, and what does that verification step look like?

## Property Manager Assignment

5. You described several factors that influence which property manager gets assigned — workload, geographic specialization, experience, and track record. When those factors point in different directions, how is the final decision made? Is there a person or a committee that breaks the tie, and what criteria take precedence?

6. Is there a formal capacity threshold that defines when a property manager is considered "too loaded" to take on a new property, or is that judgment left to a supervisor's discretion?

7. What happens if no available property manager fits the profile needed for a particular property — for example, a highly specialized luxury unit in a market where the team has limited experience? Do you bring in external resources, delay onboarding, or handle it another way?

8. Once a property manager is assigned, can that assignment be changed later in the onboarding process or after the property goes live? If so, what triggers a reassignment and how is the handover managed?

## Introductory Meeting & Expectation Alignment

9. You mentioned an introductory call or meeting between the property manager and the landlord. Is there a structured agenda or set of topics that must be covered in that meeting, or is it largely informal? How are the outcomes of that conversation documented and stored?

10. When the landlord has special conditions — such as a no-pets policy or custom maintenance responsibilities — how are those captured and carried forward into the lease and marketing materials? Who is responsible for ensuring those conditions are consistently applied?

11. What happens if, during that introductory meeting, the landlord's expectations are clearly misaligned with the company's standard policies? Is there a formal negotiation process, or can certain company policies be waived or customized for specific landlords?

## Inspection & Photography

12. Who is responsible for scheduling the photographer and inspector — is that entirely the property manager's responsibility, or does a support team coordinate those logistics? And are these professionals internal staff, preferred external vendors, or can the landlord select their own?

13. When the inspector identifies issues, how is the severity of those issues categorized? Is there a distinction between issues that must be resolved before the property can be listed versus issues that can be addressed after activation? Who makes that judgment call?

14. What is the typical timeline between the inspection visit and receiving the final inspection report? Are there situations where the property manager might begin marketing preparation activities in parallel with the inspection process, or is the inspection always a hard gate?

15. If repairs are needed, how does the company decide whether to hire its own contractors versus relying on the landlord to arrange and fund the repairs? And how are those repair timelines tracked to avoid stalling the overall onboarding?

16. Does a failed inspection restart the entire inspection process from the beginning, or is there a re-inspection workflow that is faster or more targeted in scope?

---

## Marketing & Pricing

17. When the digital marketing team sets the rental price using current market trends, does the landlord have final approval over that price, or does the company have authority to set pricing within a certain range? How are disagreements over pricing resolved?

18. Are there defined service-level timelines for how quickly the marketing team must complete listings and brochures once the inspection is passed? What happens when that team is backlogged?

19. How often are the pricing models updated, and who is responsible for maintaining them? Is the pricing specific to each city, neighborhood, or property type, and how granular does it get?

20. How long does a property typically remain in the marketing phase before it is activated in the rental portal? Is there a minimum or maximum time that materials must be prepared before going live?

---

## Tenant Screening & Leasing

21. When you describe the tenant screening process — credit checks, employment verification, landlord references — are all of these steps mandatory for every applicant, or are some steps conditional based on earlier findings? For example, do you stop screening if a credit check returns a clear disqualifying result?

22. Where multiple applicants are competing for a unit, what is the formal decision-making framework? Are there defined scoring criteria, or is the final choice largely at the property manager's discretion? Does the landlord have input or final say in selecting a tenant?

23. You mentioned offering short-term promotional discounts as a possible negotiation tactic. Who has the authority to approve those discounts, and are there limits on how deep or how long those discounts can go?

24. At what point does the landlord get involved — if at all — in reviewing or approving the selected tenant? And what happens if the landlord objects to a tenant the property manager has recommended?

25. How is the security deposit amount determined? Is it standardized, or does it vary based on property type, tenant risk profile, or local regulations? Who holds the deposit — the company or the landlord — and is that process consistent across all markets?

---

## Compliance, Quality Checks & Audits

26. You mentioned that a compliance officer reviews the lease for fair housing adherence. Does this review happen before or after the tenant has been selected and the lease has been presented? And what happens if the compliance officer identifies an issue at that stage — does the process loop back, and who bears responsibility for any delays caused?

27. When the financial analyst verifies that the agreed rental price matches profitability targets, what happens if the price that was negotiated with the landlord falls below the company's threshold? Is there a renegotiation process, or is there flexibility built into the target?

28. How does the IT department's integration check work in practice? Are there documented criteria for what a "correct" integration looks like, and who resolves discrepancies if the data in the listing doesn't match what is in the central database?

29. Are these final quality checks — compliance, financial, and IT — conducted sequentially or simultaneously? Is there a single sign-off required before a property is considered fully onboarded, and who issues that final approval?

## Timing, Sequencing & Overall Process Management

30. Is there a defined target timeline for the end-to-end onboarding process — from the landlord's initial contact to the property being fully activated and a tenant moving in? If so, what are the most common bottlenecks that cause delays against that target?

31. How is the overall progress of an onboarding tracked across the many stakeholders involved — regional coordinators, property managers, inspectors, marketing teams, compliance officers? Is there a single owner of the process at any given stage, or is ownership distributed?

32. At what point in the process would the company decide to stop onboarding a particular property entirely? What triggers that decision, who makes it, and how is the landlord notified?

---

## Exceptions & Edge Cases

33. You mentioned properties that require special insurance as a potential exception. How does the need for special insurance get identified, and who is responsible for arranging or verifying that coverage — the company, the landlord, or both?

34. When a landlord insists on custom lease clauses that go beyond your standard template, what is the approval process for accepting those clauses? Is there a legal team involved, and are there any clauses that are categorically never accepted?

35. How does the process differ, if at all, when a landlord is onboarding multiple properties at the same time rather than a single unit? Are there any economies or dependencies in how those properties are handled?

36. Are there situations where a property gets partially through the onboarding process and then needs to be paused — for example, because the landlord decides to withdraw, or a legal dispute arises over ownership? How is that state tracked, and how easily can the process be resumed if the issue is resolved?

37. How are lessons learned from previous onboarding exceptions — unusual landlord demands, regulatory surprises, or market-specific challenges — captured and fed back into improving the standard process?
