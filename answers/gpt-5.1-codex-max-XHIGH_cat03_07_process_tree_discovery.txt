A compact process tree capturing the observed variants is:

```
->(
  'Receive Application',
  'Validate Form',
  'Assess Eligibility',
  X(
    tau,
    ->(
      *('Request Missing Info', tau),
      'Validate Form'
    )
  ),
  'Approval Decision',
  'Send Confirmation',
  'Archive Case'
)
```

In words: the main sequence is RAVFAE, then either you skip missing information handling (tau) or you enter a loop with one or more “Request Missing Info”s followed by a revalidation, and finally you proceed to AD, SC, and AC.
