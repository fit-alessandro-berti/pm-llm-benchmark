To generate a temporal profile, you'll first need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities in each process variant. Then, you'll create a Python dictionary containing these values.

To do this, you'll need to parse the process variants, extract the activity pairs, and calculate the averages and standard deviations.

Here's some Python code to accomplish this:
```python
import re
import statistics

process_variants = """
... (put your process variants here, exactly as provided)
"""

# Define a regular expression pattern to extract activities and durations
pattern = r'(?:Create Fine -> )?([^ ->]+) -> ([^ ->]+) \(([^)]+), ([^)]+)\)'

# Initialize an empty dictionary to store the temporal profile
temporal_profile = {}

# Iterate through each process variant
for variant in process_variants.strip().split('\n'):
    matches = re.findall(pattern, variant)
    # Calculate the total duration of the variant
    total_duration = float(matches[-1][1])
    # Initialize lists to store the durations between each pair of activities
    durations = {}
    for i in range(len(matches) - 1):
        act1, act2 = matches[i][1], matches[i + 1][1]
        key = tuple(sorted([act1, act2]))
        durations[key] = durations.get(key, []) + [total_duration]
        total_duration -= float(matches[i + 1][1])

    # Calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair of activities
    for key, duration_list in durations.items():
        avg = statistics.mean(duration_list)
        stdev = statistics.stdev(duration_list) if len(duration_list) > 1 else 0
        temporal_profile[key] = (avg, stdev)

# Print the temporal profile
print(temporal_profile)
```

Make sure to replace the `...` in the `process_variants` string with your actual process variants. This code will parse the process variants, calculate the averages and standard deviations for each pair of activities, and store them in the `temporal_profile` dictionary.

Please note that the code does not calculate the times between activities that are not directly connected in the same process variant. If you want to consider all possible activity pairs, you'll need to modify the code to calculate the times between activities that are not directly connected.
