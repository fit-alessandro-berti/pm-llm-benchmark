The pseudo-BPMN representation provided outlines a structured business process for handling customer requests, which can be categorized as either standard or custom. Here's a detailed explanation of the process, step by step, along with clarifications on the purpose of each step, the gateways, and the conditions that determine which paths are taken:

### 1. Start Event
The process begins with the receipt of a customer request.

### 2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request"
This step involves the initial reception of the customer's request. It sets the context for the subsequent tasks.

### 3. Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type
This is a decision point where the type of the customer's request (standard or custom) is evaluated.

#### If Type = Standard
- **Task B1: Perform Standard Validation**
  - Validates the standard request according to predefined criteria.

- **Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks**
  - This gateway initiates parallel processing of the following tasks:
    - **Task C1: Credit Check**
    - **Task C2: Inventory Check**
  - These tasks run concurrently to assess the customer's creditworthiness and the availability of inventory for a standard product.

- **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
  - Once both credit and inventory checks are completed, the process moves on to the next task, ensuring that all necessary checks for standard requests are done.

- **Task D: Calculate Delivery Date**
  - Based on the results of the checks, this task calculates the expected delivery date for the standard request.

#### If Type = Custom
- **Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis**
  - Conducts an analysis to determine if the customization requested by the customer is feasible given current constraints (like production capabilities, technology limitations, etc.).

- **Gateway (XOR): Is Customization Feasible?**
  - Evaluates whether the custom request is feasible based on the outcome of the feasibility analysis.
    - **If Yes**
      - **Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation**
        - Constructs a detailed quotation for the custom request.
    - **If No**
      - **Task E2: Send Rejection Notice**
        - Notifies the customer that the requested customization is not possible.

### 4. Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Needed?
- After completing either the standard or custom path tasks, the process checks if approval from a manager is required for the request.
    - **If Yes**
      - **Task F: Obtain Manager Approval**
        - Seeks approval from a manager to proceed with the request.
      - **Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Granted?**
        - Once approval is sought, this gateway determines whether the approval has been granted or not.
          - **If Yes**
            - **Task G: Generate Final Invoice**
              - Issues the final invoice for the request.
          - **If No**
            - **Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions**
              - The process loops back to either Task E1 (if the request was custom) or Task D (if it was standard) to reassess the conditions and possibly adjust the request or quotation.
    - **If No Approval Needed**
      - **Task G: Generate Final Invoice**
        - Proceeds directly to generate the final invoice without needing further approval.

### 5. Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer
- After generating the final invoice, the process sends a confirmation to the customer, providing them with all necessary details regarding their request.

### 6. End Event
- Marks the completion of the entire process, indicating that all tasks have been successfully executed and the customer has been informed.

### Summary
The process is designed to efficiently handle both standard and custom customer requests by systematically validating requests, conducting necessary checks, and obtaining approvals when required. The use of gateways ensures that the process can dynamically adapt based on the specifics of each request and the outcomes of validations and feasibility analyses, ensuring that all customer requests are managed in a structured and compliant manner.
