**Output:**

```
High-Level Step: Material Preparation
  Low-level Activities: Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet
  Justification: These activities involve preparing the raw material for further processing. They focus on retrieving, identifying, positioning, and preparing the material for the subsequent steps. They logically belong together as they are all part of the initial setup process.

High-Level Step: Assembly
  Low-level Activities: Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B
  Justification: These steps involve the physical assembly of the product. They are grouped together because they use the same resource (operator B) and they contribute to building the structure of the item. The activity of picking up a welding tool logically precedes the actual welding actions.

High-Level Step: Quality Inspection
  Low-level Activities: Measure weld integrity, Visual check
  Justification: These activities are quality checks, designed to ensure that the assembly meets the required standards. They occur after the assembly process and are critical for verifying the integrity of the product.

High-Level Step: Finishing
  Low-level Activities: Apply protective coating, Dry coating
  Justification: These steps are grouped because they are directly involved with the finishing and protection of the product, typically applied after the core assembly and quality assurance steps. The coating is applied and then dried for it to be set.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`group_events(event_log)` function:**
    *   Takes the event log (`pd.DataFrame`) as input.
    *   Defines a dictionary `high_level_steps` which will hold the grouped steps:
        *   Keys are descriptive names of the high-level process steps.
        *   Values are dictionaries containing:
            *   `activities`: a list of low-level activity names that belong to the high-level step.
            *   `justification`: a text explanation for the grouping.
    *   Returns the `high_level_steps` dictionary.

2.  **Sample Event Log:**
    *   The code includes a sample event log converted to a pandas DataFrame.
    *   This log includes multiple cases, with timestamps, activity names, resources, and additional information.

3.  **Grouping Logic:**
    *   The `high_level_steps` dictionary in `group_events` function shows the logic used for grouping.
    *   **Material Preparation:** Events related to setting up the raw material (retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, preheating) are grouped together as they are part of the same initial processing phase.
    *   **Assembly:** Events related to welding are grouped together as they're part of assembling the product using the tool, they are temporally related and performed by the same resource.
    *   **Quality Inspection:** Events related to inspecting the weld and visually checking it are grouped, as they form part of QA process.
    *   **Finishing:** Events related to applying coating and drying it are grouped as they are related to finishing process.

4.  **Output Format:**
    *   The output shows each high-level process step.
    *   It lists the low-level activities within that step.
    *   It provides a justification explaining why those activities were grouped.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Process Abstraction:** Moving from low-level granular data to higher-level, more understandable representations.
*   **Temporal Proximity:** Grouping events that happen close in time.
*   **Resource and Context:** Grouping events performed by the same resource or that are logically related to the process workflow.
*   **Domain Knowledge:** Applying knowledge about manufacturing processes to understand which activities belong together.

This solution provides a way to automatically abstract low-level event log information into high-level process phases. The result is a simplified view of the manufacturing workflow that is easier to comprehend. This provides a solid foundation for further process mining analysis and improvements.
