Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the temporal profile provided and identify the anomalies based on the averages and standard deviations. 

Looking at the temporal_profile dictionary:

Starting with ('R', 'A'): 1 hour average with 10 minutes STDEV. That seems okay, maybe a bit tight but maybe automated assignment?

Then ('R', 'E') is 1 day with 8 hours STDEV. That might be reasonable, as evaluation might take a day but can vary.

The next one is ('R', 'P') with an average of 90000 seconds. Wait, 90000 seconds is 25 hours. The STDEV is 3600 (1 hour). That's a very low STDEV. So the average is about a day, but the deviation is very tight. That's suspicious. Maybe the approval is happening almost immediately after some fixed time, or maybe it's an automated step that's scheduled at specific times, leading to little variation. That's one anomaly.

('A', 'C') has an average of 7200 seconds (2 hours) with STDEV 3600 (1 hour). Hmm, closing the claim 2 hours after assignment? But the process steps between A and C should include Evaluate, Approve, Notify, etc. So closing so quickly might mean steps are being skipped, hence another anomaly.

('E', 'N') is 5 minutes average, 1 minute STDEV. That's really fast. Evaluating the claim and then immediately notifying the customer? Maybe automated, but does that skip the approval step? Like, maybe the notification is sent before approval is done? That's a problem, so that's an anomaly.

('P', 'N') has an average of 7 days (604800 seconds) with 2 days (172800) STDEV. That's a long time between approval and notification. Like a week? That seems too long. Maybe there's a backlog in notifications, or some manual steps causing delays. The high STDEV suggests inconsistency here.

('N', 'C') is 30 minutes with 5 minutes STDEV. That seems okay, since after notification, closing soon after makes sense if it's automated.

So the main anomalies are:

1. R to P: Short time with very low STDEV. Maybe approval is happening too quickly, perhaps automatically after a fixed delay, but that's odd because approval should come after evaluation, which takes a day. So maybe the model has an error, or there's a workflow issue where approval is triggered too early.

2. P to N: 7 days is way too long. Maybe there's a delay in notifying after approval, perhaps notifications are batched or there's a bottleneck.

3. A to C: 2 hours from assignment to closure skips steps. So claims are being closed before all steps are done. Maybe manual overrides?

4. E to N: 5 minutes between evaluation and notification. But according to the process steps, after evaluation comes approval, then notification. So if evaluation leads directly to notification, that skips approval. So this is a possible step order issue.

Now, for hypotheses on reasons:

For R-P anomaly: Maybe the approval is being automatically triggered immediately after a certain step, but in reality, the evaluation should come before. Or the model's data might have included some claims where approval is done quickly, but this could be due to bypassing steps, like auto-approving certain claims, leading to tight STDEV.

P-N's long delay: Maybe after approval, there's a manual step that's slow, like a manager review, or the notification system is slow. High STDEV suggests sometimes it's quick, sometimes slow, maybe due to different adjusters or regions.

A-C too quick: Maybe claims are being assigned and then closed without proper processing. Could be a mistake, like an adjuster closing it without doing the work, or maybe some claims are being assigned and then auto-closed if they're invalid, but that's supposed to be handled earlier.

E-N skipping steps: The steps after evaluation should be approval and then notify. So if evaluation directly goes to notify, that's a missing step. Maybe the approval is being done automatically, but the model's data might have some errors, or the approval is not properly recorded, or the workflow is misconfigured.

Next, the SQL queries need to verify these anomalies. Let's think about each anomaly and how to check.

For R-P anomaly (short time between R and P):

We can calculate the time between R and P for each claim. The average in the model is 25 hours, but we need to see if real data has such a tight distribution. The query would select claims where the time between R and P is close to that average, or maybe outside expected Z-scores. Alternatively, find claims where the R to P time is outside the average plus 3 STDEV or something. But first, to find claims where the time between R and P is less than expected, or has low variance.

Alternatively, to check if there are many claims where the time between R and P is exactly around that 25-hour mark with minimal variance, that would support the anomaly.

SQL for R to P:

SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_time - r_time)) AS r_p_duration
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id, 
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS r_time
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) sub
WHERE r_time IS NOT NULL AND p_time IS NOT NULL;

Then, compute the average and STDEV from this data. But since the user wants to identify claims where these times are outside the expected, maybe a query that flags claims where the duration is below or above certain thresholds. But perhaps first, just a query to get the durations and see if they cluster tightly around 25 hours.

For the A to C anomaly (closing too quickly):

Check time between A and C. The average is 2 hours, but according to the process steps, between A and C there should be E, P, N. So if A to C is 2 hours, maybe steps are missing. So the SQL would calculate the time between A and C and see if there are many cases with very short durations, and also check if those claims have E, P, N events in between.

Alternatively, find claims where the time from A to C is less than 2 hours, but also check if they have the intervening steps.

So a query could be:

SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_time - a_time)) AS a_c_duration,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ce2 
        WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id 
        AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P', 'N')
        AND ce2.timestamp BETWEEN a_time AND c_time) AS steps_count
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id, 
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS a_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS c_time
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) sub
WHERE a_time IS NOT NULL AND c_time IS NOT NULL;

This would help see if the steps between A and C exist. If steps_count is less than 3 (E, P, N), then that's a problem.

For E to N (5 minutes):

The process steps should be E -> P -> N. But E to N being 5 minutes suggests that maybe the approval is skipped? Or the model has E and N linked incorrectly. To check, find claims where the time between E and N is very short and see if the approval step is missing or happening in between.

Query:

SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - e_time)) AS e_n_duration,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events ce2 
        WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id 
        AND ce2.activity = 'P' 
        AND ce2.timestamp BETWEEN e_time AND n_time) AS has_approval
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id, 
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS e_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_time
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) sub
WHERE e_time IS NOT NULL AND n_time IS NOT NULL;

If many claims have e_n_duration very low (like 5 mins) but no approval (has_approval = 0), that's a problem.

For P to N's 7 days delay:

Check claims where the time between P and N is over a week. Maybe:

SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time)) AS p_n_duration
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id, 
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_time
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
) sub
WHERE p_time IS NOT NULL AND n_time IS NOT NULL 
AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time)) > (7*24*60*60); -- 7 days in seconds

This would find claims where the delay is over a week, which might indicate a backlog.

Additionally, checking if these delays are in certain regions or adjusters could help. For example, joining with adjusters to see if specific adjusters have these long delays.

Another angle: Maybe some activities are missing. For the E to N case, check if the approval activity (P) occurs between E and N.

Also, for the R to P anomaly, check if the evaluation step (E) occurs before P. If not, that's an issue, because P should come after E.

Another query for R-P anomaly:

Check if the approval (P) is happening before evaluation (E) in some cases, which would be a process error.

SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) < 
       MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END);

That would find claims where P happens before E, which is out of order.

Alternatively, check the order of activities to see if they follow the correct sequence.

Also, for the A to C issue, maybe the process steps are being bypassed. So checking if between A and C, the necessary steps (E, P, N) are present.

Another possible query: For each claim, check the sequence of activities. They should be R -> A -> E -> P -> N -> C. So a claim's events must have all those steps in order. To check if some claims are missing steps or have out-of-order steps.

But that might be complex. Alternatively, for each claim, list the activities and their timestamps in order, then check the sequence.

But given the SQL constraints, perhaps better to focus on specific pairs.

Additionally, for the P-N delay, maybe some notifications are being delayed because of certain adjusters or regions. So joining with adjusters table to see if a particular region has many such delays.

So a query could be:

SELECT a.region, COUNT(*) 
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters ad ON ... Wait, adjusters are linked via the resource column in claim_events? Wait, the 'resource' column in claim_events is the resource (like adjuster) who performed the activity. So to get adjuster info, we can join claim_events with adjusters via the resource = adjuster's name or ID? Wait, in the adjusters table, the ID is adjuster_id, but the 'resource' in claim_events might be the adjuster's name or ID. The schema says 'resource' is a VARCHAR, so maybe it's the name, which would match the 'name' in adjusters. So:

SELECT a.adjuster_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE activity = 'P' OR activity = 'N' -- Not sure, but for the P-N delay, maybe look at the adjusters involved in those steps.

Alternatively, for the P to N delay, group by adjuster and see who has the longest durations.

But perhaps the main queries are to identify the claims where these anomalies occur, then correlate with other factors.

I think the user wants specific SQL queries for each anomaly. Let me structure the answers accordingly.
</think>

### Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile:  
1. **R  P (Receive  Approve):** Abnormally short average time (25 hours) with nearly no variability (1-hour STDEV). Likely indicates an automated or rigid workflow bypassing required steps.  
2. **P  N (Approve  Notify):** Averaging 7 days with high variability (2-day STDEV), suggesting inconsistent backlogs or manual bottlenecks.  
3. **A  C (Assign  Close):** Claims are closed within 2 hours of assignment, implying skipped steps like evaluation or approval.  
4. **E  N (Evaluate  Notify):** Only 5 minutes between evaluation and notification, bypassing the required approval step (P).  

---

### Hypotheses for Anomalies:  
1. **R  P Anomaly:**  
   - Automated approval triggered prematurely, e.g., approval occurs before evaluation.  
   - Data corruption where "P" is misrecorded as occurring early.  
   - Claims being auto-approved based on low-value thresholds, skipping human review.  

2. **P  N Anomaly:**  
   - Manual notification steps requiring manager sign-off, causing delays.  
   - Technical issues delaying notification system integration.  
   - Notifications are batch-processed weekly, creating delays.  

3. **A  C Anomaly:**  
   - Claims are auto-closed by the system if no activity occurs after assignment (e.g., abandoned claims).  
   - Adjusters closing claims prematurely due to misconfiguration.  

4. **E  N Anomaly:**  
   - Notifications are triggered automatically after evaluation, bypassing approval (P.  
   - Approval (P) is mislabeled as part of evaluation (E.

### Verification SQL Queries:  

#### 1. **Identify R  P Anomalies (Short Duration):**  
```sql  
SELECT claim_id,  
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_time - r_time)) AS r_p_duration,  
       (p_time - r_time) AS duration_diff  
FROM (  
    SELECT claim_id,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS r_time  
    FROM claim_events  
    GROUP BY claim_id  
) sub  
WHERE r_time IS NOT NULL AND p_time IS NOT NULL  
AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_time - r_time)) BETWEEN 24*3600 - 600 AND 24*3600 + 600; -- Check claims near the suspicious average  
```  

#### 2. **Identify P  N Delays (>7 Days):**  
```sql  
SELECT claim_id,  
       EXTRACT(DAY FROM (n_time - p_time)) AS p_n_days  
FROM (  
    SELECT claim_id,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_time  
    FROM claim_events  
    GROUP BY claim_id  
) sub  
WHERE p_time < n_time  
AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM (n_time - p_time)) > 7;  
```  

#### 3. **Identify A  C Premature Closures:**  
```sql  
SELECT c.claim_id,  
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.close_time - a_time)) AS a_c_duration,  
       (SELECT COUNT(*)  
        FROM claim_events  
        WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id  
        AND activity IN ('E', 'P', 'N')) AS intermediate_steps  
FROM (  
    SELECT claim_id,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS a_time,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_time  
    FROM claim_events  
    GROUP BY claim_id  
) c  
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - a_time) < 7200 -- 2 hours  
AND intermediate_steps < 3; -- Missing steps (E, P, N)  
```  

#### 4. **Check E  N Skipping Approval (P):**  
```sql  
SELECT claim_id,  
       e_time, n_time, p_time  
FROM (  
    SELECT claim_id,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS e_time,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time,  
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_time  
    FROM claim_events  
    GROUP BY claim_id  
) sub  
WHERE p_time IS NULL OR p_time > n_time; -- Approval occurs after notification, or lacks approval entirely  
```  

#### 5. **Correlate Adjusters with Anomalies:**  
```sql  
SELECT a.name AS adjuster,  
       COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count  
FROM claim_events ce  
JOIN adjusters ad ON ce.resource = ad.name -- Assuming "resource" stores adjuster names  
WHERE activity = 'P' OR activity = 'N'  
AND claim_id IN (  
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events  
    WHERE (activity = 'P' AND EXTRACT(DAY FROM (n_time - p_time)) > 7) -- PN delays  
    OR (activity = 'C' AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - a_time) < 7200) -- Premature closure  
)  
GROUP BY a.name;  
```

### Key Insights:  
- The queries focus on **sequence integrity** (e.g., P must occur between E and N), **time thresholds**, and **resource accountability** (adjusters causing delays/skips).  
- The extremely low STDEV for RP suggests a hard-coded timer or workflow bypass, while the PN delay may reflect regional adjuster inefficiency.
