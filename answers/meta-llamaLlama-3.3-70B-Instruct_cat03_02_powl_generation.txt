Here's a Python code that constructs the POWL model according to the given scenario:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Create the initial transitions
SR = Transition(label="Service Request (SR)")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation (DA)")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization (ACI)")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration (BNC)")
DnR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment (CD)")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment (MD)")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance (QA)")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit (SA)")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")

# Create the POWL model for the loop between BNC and DnR
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DnR])

# Create the POWL model for the exclusive choice between CD and MD
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Create a partial order for DA and ACI
parallels = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
parallels.order.add_edge(DA, ACI)  # DA and ACI have no ordering constraints for this example
# but in the code, add_edge is used here for no constraints, typically we'll want to make them parallel, 
# although this scenario specifically stated they can be done concurrently

# Create a partial order for QA and SA
tests = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
# Like before, for concurrent: no specific constraint is required
# Therefore no add_edge for tests

# Create the root partial order and add edges according to the given scenario
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, parallels, loop, xor, tests, GLA])
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # SR -> CS
root.order.add_edge(CS, parallels)  # CS -> DA & ACI
root.order.add_edge(parallels, loop)  # DA & ACI -> BNC & DnR loop
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)  # BNC & DnR loop -> CD XOR MD
root.order.add_edge(xor, tests)  # CD XOR MD -> QA & SA
root.order.add_edge(tests, GLA)  # QA & SA -> GLA
```

The code defines each step of the process as a transition and links them according to the given scenario using partial orders and operator nodes for loops and exclusive choices. 

Here's a quick summary:
- A `Transition` is created for each step.
- A `StrictPartialOrder` (node set and partial order) models parallel tasks.
- An `OperatorPOWL` models loops and exclusive choices.
- Partial orders define the constraints between tasks.

The root partial order and the edges represent the sequence and dependencies between tasks. It starts with the service request, proceeds through contract setup, datacenter allocation and access control initialization in parallel, a loop for base network configuration and debug/reconfigure, an exclusive choice for containerized or monolithic deployment, quality assurance and security audit in parallel, and ends with go-live approval.
