**Anomalies:**

*   **R to P (Receive to Approve):** Abnormally low standard deviation (1 hour) for a 25-hour average duration.  This suggests a rigid, potentially automated process not reflecting real-world variability.
*   **P to N (Approve to Notify):** Excessively long average delay (7 days) with high standard deviation (2 days) indicates inconsistent notification practices.
*   **A to C (Assign to Close):** Short average duration (2 hours) between assignment and closure raises concerns about potentially skipped steps.
*   **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** Extremely short average duration (5 minutes) suggests a potentially automated or rushed process that might be skipping necessary checks.

**Hypotheses:**

*   **R to P:** Automated approval process triggered by specific claim types or amounts, bypassing manual review.
*   **P to N:** Backlog in the notification process, potentially due to resource constraints or system issues. Alternatively, some notifications might be sent immediately via a different channel, leading to high variability.
*   **A to C:** Premature closure of claims due to data entry errors, system glitches, or fraudulent activity.
*   **E to N:** Automated notification triggered immediately after evaluation, potentially without proper review or updates.

**Verification SQL Queries:**

1.  **R to P Anomaly (Rigid Approval):**

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P'
AND timestamp - (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claim_events.claim_id AND activity = 'R') > INTERVAL '26 hour' -- Checking for > 1 hour deviation
AND timestamp - (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claim_events.claim_id AND activity = 'R') < INTERVAL '24 hour'; -- Checking for < 1 hour deviation
```

2.  **P to N Anomaly (Notification Delays):**

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'N'
AND timestamp - (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claim_events.claim_id AND activity = 'P') > INTERVAL '3 days'; -- Checking for delays > 3 days
```

3.  **A to C Anomaly (Premature Closure):**

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'C'
AND timestamp - (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claim_events.claim_id AND activity = 'A') < INTERVAL '1 hour' -- Checking for closure < 1 hour after assignment
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claim_events.claim_id AND activity IN ('E', 'P')); -- Ensuring no Evaluation or Approval events
```

4.  **E to N Anomaly (Rushed Notification):**

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'N'
AND timestamp - (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claim_events.claim_id AND activity = 'E') < INTERVAL '1 minute'; -- Checking for notification < 1 minute after evaluation
```

5.  **Correlation with Adjusters (Example for P to N):**

```sql
SELECT a.name, COUNT(DISTINCT ce.claim_id)
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON c.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'N'
AND ce.timestamp - (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'P') > INTERVAL '3 days'
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT ce.claim_id) DESC;
```
