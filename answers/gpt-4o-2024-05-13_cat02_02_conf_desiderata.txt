### Normative Rule Violations

1. **Case 1**:  
   - **No Violations**: This case follows the entire sequence correctly according to the strict rules.

2. **Case 2**: 
   - **Violations**:
     - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**: The Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check, which violates the required sequence.
     - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**: Finalizing Documentation occurred after the loan was rejected. In normative terms, finalizing documentation is only allowed if the loan is approved.

3. **Case 3**:
   - **No Violations**: There are no strict rule violations despite the presence of some minor delays. All necessary steps were completed in the correct sequence.

### Desiderata Condition Failures

1. **Case 1**:
   - **No Failures**: This case adheres to both the strict rules and the recommended best practices.

2. **Case 2**:
   - **No Specific Desiderata Violations**: The failure here is primarily on normative grounds with no explicit mention of violating the recommended timing guidelines or follow-up calls.

3. **Case 3**:
   - **Credit Check Delay**: The Credit Check happened more than 24 hours after receiving the application (48 hours later), which deviates from the recommendation.
   - **Inform Applicant Delay**: Informing the applicant occurred more than 48 hours after the loan decision (4 days later), which is suboptimal.
   - **No Follow-up Call**: Although not required by normative rules, there was no follow-up call after informing the applicant.

### Interpretations and Justifications

1. **Case 1**:
   - Everything was done correctly, showing a good example of adherence to both the normative rules and the best practices.

2. **Case 2**:
   - The early Risk Assessment might indicate a process error or a misunderstanding of the required sequence among the staff.
   - Finalizing Documentation after rejection suggests either a procedural misstep or potential miscommunication, indicating a need for clearer instructions or better training.

3. **Case 3**:
   - The delay in the Credit Check and the late notification to the applicant might suggest resource constraints, such as workload issues, staff shortage, or prioritization of other tasks. These delays do not severely violate the process but show room for improvement in efficiency.
   - The lack of a follow-up call is not a significant issue but shows an area where the process can be enhanced to ensure better customer communication and satisfaction.

### Summary

1. **Normative Rule Violations**:
   - Case 2 violates strict sequence rules and improper documentation processing after rejection.

2. **Desiderata Violations**:
   - Case 3 shows delays that breach recommended timings and lacks a follow-up call for customer engagement which, while not critical, suggests a need for process refinement.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Improve staff training and process documentation to avoid sequence errors in Case 2.
   - Address resource constraints or adjust process priorities to adhere better to recommended timelines in Case 3.
   - Consider incorporating follow-up calls as a standard step, even if not mandatory, to enhance customer service.
