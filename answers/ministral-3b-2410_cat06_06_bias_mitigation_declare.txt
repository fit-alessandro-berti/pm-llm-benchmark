# Explanation:
# 1. **bias_mitigation_coexistence**: Ensures that when a decision is made for a minority applicant, a manual review must always coexist. This prevents immediate biased decisions without proper checks.
# 2. **bias_mitigation_response**: Ensures that any check for sensitive attributes (like applicant race) must be followed by a bias mitigation check before any decision is made. This introduces a step to review and mitigate potential biases.
# 3. **bias_mitigation_nonsuccession**: Prevents a direct succession from a sensitive attribute check (like checking applicant race) to a final decision. This ensures that decisions are not made immediately based on sensitive attributes, reducing the risk of biased outcomes.

These added constraints help ensure that the loan application process is fair and unbiased by introducing checks and balances at critical decision points.
