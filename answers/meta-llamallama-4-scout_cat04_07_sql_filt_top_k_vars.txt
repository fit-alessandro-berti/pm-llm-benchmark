### Solution

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps and provide a DuckDB SQL query that achieves the desired outcome.

#### Step 1: Extract Ordered Sequences of Activities

First, we need to extract the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id`. We can do this by using the `LISTAGG` function with `GROUP BY` and sorting by `timestamp`.

#### Step 2: Group Cases by Their Activity Sequence

Next, we'll group these cases by their activity sequence and count how many cases correspond to each variant.

#### Step 3: Identify Top K Variants

Then, we'll identify the top K variants by their frequency.

#### Step 4: Filter Events Belonging to Top K Variants

Finally, we'll filter the original event log to include only events from cases that belong to these top K variants.

Here's the DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes these steps:

```sql
WITH 
-- Step 1: Extract ordered sequences of activities per case
ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity, '->') OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
),

-- Step 2: Count cases per variant
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) AS variant_count
    FROM 
        ordered_cases
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
),

-- Step 3: Identify top K variants
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        variant_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        variant_counts
)

-- Step 4: Filter events belonging to top K variants
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
INNER JOIN 
    ordered_cases oc ON el.case_id = oc.case_id
INNER JOIN 
    top_k_variants tkv ON oc.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
WHERE 
    tkv.rank <= K  -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
ORDER BY 
    el.timestamp;
```

However, since we need to replace `K` with the actual number of top variants we want and also correctly reference the `activity_sequence` in the join, let's adjust the query to be more accurate and complete:

```sql
-- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
DECLARE K INT = 10;  -- Example: Top 10 variants

WITH 
-- Step 1: Extract ordered sequences of activities per case
ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),

-- Step 2: Count cases per variant
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS variant_count
    FROM 
        ordered_cases
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
),

-- Step 3: Identify top K variants
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        variant_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        variant_counts
)

-- Step 4: Filter events belonging to top K variants
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
INNER JOIN 
    ordered_cases oc ON el.case_id = oc.case_id
INNER JOIN 
    top_k_variants tkv ON oc.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
WHERE 
    tkv.rank <= K  -- Filter by top K variants
ORDER BY 
    el.timestamp;
```

This query still has a logical flaw in that it doesn't correctly reference `activity_sequence` in all parts, particularly in joins and aggregations. The accurate approach would involve subqueries or CTEs to ensure that we correctly join and filter based on the top variants. Let's optimize and correct the query to accurately reflect the steps:

```sql
DECLARE K INT = 10;  -- Example: Top 10 variants

WITH 
-- Step 1: ordered sequences of activities per case
ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),

-- Step 2: Count cases per variant and rank them
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM 
        ordered_cases
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
),

-- Step 3: Identify top K variants
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        variant_counts
)

-- Step 4: Filter events belonging to top K variants
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
INNER JOIN 
    ordered_cases oc ON el.case_id = oc.case_id
INNER JOIN 
    variant_counts vc ON oc.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
INNER JOIN 
    top_k_variants tkv ON vc.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
WHERE 
    tkv.rank <= K
ORDER BY 
    el.timestamp;
```

The accurate approach should utilize window functions or aggregations correctly to identify and filter by top K variants:

```sql
DECLARE K INT = 10;

WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
    -- This is incorrect because LISTAGG with GROUP BY doesn't work as expected in DuckDB
    -- Instead, use ROW_NUMBER or other window functions correctly
),

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM 
        ordered_cases
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
),

ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY variant_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        variant_counts
)

SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
WHERE 
    el.case_id IN (
        SELECT 
            oc.case_id
        FROM 
            ordered_cases oc
        INNER JOIN 
            top_k_variants tkv ON oc.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
        WHERE 
            tkv.rank <= K
    );
```

The corrected and complete query considering accurate subquerying and joining would actually look like:

```sql
DECLARE K INT = 10;

WITH activity_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM 
        activity_sequences
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM 
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY 
        variant_count DESC
    LIMIT 
        K
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
WHERE 
    el.case_id IN (
        SELECT 
            case_id
        FROM 
            activity_sequences
        WHERE 
            activity_sequence IN (
                SELECT 
                    activity_sequence
                FROM 
                    top_k_variants
            )
    );
```

But to accurately reflect and join on case_id and ensure proper ranking:

```sql
DECLARE K INT = 10;

WITH activity_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM 
        activity_sequences
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM 
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY 
        variant_count DESC
    LIMIT 
        K
)

SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
INNER JOIN 
    activity_sequences ac ON el.case_id = ac.case_id
WHERE 
    ac.activity_sequence IN (
        SELECT 
            activity_sequence
        FROM 
            top_k_variants
    );
```

This final query effectively filters event logs to only include those cases that belong to the top K process variants, ordered by their occurrence frequency. 

**But here is an accurate way of doing it (Avoiding Subqueries for Performance):**

```sql
DECLARE K INT = 10;

WITH sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
ranked_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM 
        sequences
    GROUP BY 
        activity_sequence
),
top_k AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence
    FROM 
        ranked_sequences
    ORDER BY 
        count DESC
    LIMIT 
        K
)

SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
INNER JOIN 
    sequences s ON el.case_id = s.case_id
WHERE 
    s.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k);
```
