**1. Cases Violating Normative Rules:**

**Case 2** is violating the normative rules for the following reasons:

- **Risk Assessment Occurred Before Credit Check:** In Case 2, the "Risk Assessment" was performed at 08:20 on 2024-01-11, before the "Credit Check" which took place at 09:00 on the same day. According to the strict ordering rules, the Credit Check must occur before the Risk Assessment. Changing the order of these activities is explicitly prohibited in the normative constraints.

- **Finalize Documentation After Loan Rejection:** After the Loan Decision of "Rejected" at 09:30 on 2024-01-11, "Finalize Documentation" was performed at 10:00. This violates the normative rule stating that if a loan is rejected, the process should not include the "Finalize Documentation" activity before closing the case. Performing "Finalize Documentation" after a rejection is not allowed.

- **Missing "Inform Applicant" Activity:** There is no record of the "Inform Applicant" activity in Case 2. The normative process requires that the applicant be informed of the loan decision after the "Loan Decision" activity. Skipping this mandatory step violates the process rules which prohibit skipping activities in the required sequence.

**Cases 1 and 3** follow the normative process without violating the strict rules:

- **Case 1:** All activities occurred in the correct order with none skipped or improperly performed.
- **Case 3:** Despite some delays (addressed in the desiderata violations), all required activities occurred in the proper sequence.

**2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions:**

**Case 1:**

- **No Follow-up Call:** The process recommends performing a "Follow-up Call" before closing the case to ensure all parties are aligned. Case 1 does not include this activity, representing a minor deviation from the recommended best practices.

**Case 2:**

- **No Follow-up Call:** Similar to Case 1, there is no "Follow-up Call" recorded before closing the case, indicating a failure to meet this recommendation.

**Case 3:**

- **Delayed Credit Check:** The "Credit Check" was performed at 10:00 on 2024-01-14, approximately 49 hours after the "Application Received" at 09:00 on 2024-01-12. This exceeds the recommended time frame of within 24 hours, representing a suboptimal delay.

- **Delayed Informing of Applicant:** The "Inform Applicant" activity occurred at 15:00 on 2024-01-16, about 51 hours after the "Loan Decision" at 12:00 on 2024-01-14. This surpasses the recommended 48-hour window, indicating a delay in communication.

- **No Follow-up Call:** Like the other cases, Case 3 does not include a "Follow-up Call" before closing the case, failing to meet this desideratum.

While these deviations are not severe violations, they highlight areas where process performance did not align with the recommended best practices, indicating opportunities for improvement.

**3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors:**

**For Case 2 Violations:**

- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:** The misordering might be due to an oversight or misunderstanding by the staff member handling the case. It's possible that in an effort to expedite the process, the staff prematurely initiated the Risk Assessment without realizing it should follow the Credit Check.

- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection:** The staff may have been confused about the procedure for handling rejected loans, mistakenly believing that documentation needed to be finalized regardless of the decision. Alternatively, there may have been an internal policy change or exceptional circumstance not reflected in the established process.

- **Missing "Inform Applicant" Activity:** The absence of this activity could indicate that the applicant was informed through a method not captured in the event log, such as an informal conversation or automated communication. It's also possible that the step was inadvertently skipped due to oversight or time constraints.

**For Desiderata Deviations:**

- **Delayed Activities in Case 3:** The delays in performing the "Credit Check" and "Inform Applicant" activities could be attributed to resource constraints, such as staffing shortages or high workload volumes. External factors, like waiting for information from third-party services (e.g., credit agencies), might have contributed to the delays.

- **Lack of Follow-up Calls in All Cases:** The omission of the "Follow-up Call" across all cases suggests that this recommended activity may not be integrated into the regular workflow. Staff might prioritize mandatory tasks over recommendations, especially under time pressure. There may also be a perception that the follow-up is unnecessary if all parties seem satisfied with the outcome.

These interpretations point to potential areas for process improvement, such as enhanced training to ensure understanding of the process flow, better resource management to prevent delays, and reinforcement of the importance of recommended best practices to optimize overall performance.
