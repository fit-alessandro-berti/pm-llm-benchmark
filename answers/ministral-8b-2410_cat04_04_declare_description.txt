The overall process can be described as an approval and payment handling sequence initiated by an employee's submission of a declaration, which is followed by various approval and payment steps, with the final activity being the approval of the declaration by a supervisor. This sequence involves alternating and sometimes chaining of activities, ensuring that certain activities must occur in a specific order and sometimes without repetition.
