Below is a single, integrated event log for **Order#1234**, using **System A’s timestamps as the primary timeline** (when present) and including System B timestamps/attributes where matched. When only one system recorded an event, that system’s timestamp is used as primary. Events are listed in chronological order.

### Integrated Event Log

| Primary Timestamp (chosen)       | Event Name (Unified)                 | Order ID     | System A TS            | System B TS            | User ID | Resource ID | Notes                                       | Source (Merge)            |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|

**Notes on Columns**  
- **Primary Timestamp**: Default to System A’s timestamp if present (primary timeline). If only System B captured the event, B’s timestamp is used.  
- **System A TS / System B TS**: Original timestamps retained to show any offsets.  
- **Source (Merge)**: Indicates whether the entry is a merge of both logs or comes from only one system.

### Reasoning & Matching Decisions

1. **Order Received** (A: 10:00:00, B: 09:59:58, event names “Order Received” vs. “OrderReceived”)  
   - Time difference is 2 seconds; names are semantically identical. Merged into one event with primary timestamp from A.

2. **Order Validated** (A: 10:01:30, B: 10:01:29, “Order Validated” vs. “OrderValidation”)  
   - Time difference ~1 second; same activity. Merged with primary timestamp from A.

3. **Payment Processed** (A: 10:02:00, B: 10:02:05, “Payment Processed” vs. “PaymentCheck”)  
   - Time difference ~5 seconds, slightly above the nominal 2-second tolerance. However, event names and context clearly refer to the same step (payment). Merged, choosing A’s timestamp as primary and keeping B’s timestamp/metadata.

4. **Quality Check** (B only at 10:03:00)  
   - No corresponding event in A. Included as a standalone System B event; inserted chronologically by its timestamp.

5. **Item Shipped / Shipping** (A: 10:05:00, B: 10:05:02, “Item Shipped” vs. “Shipping”)  
   - Time difference is 2 seconds. Names align; merged with A’s timestamp as primary, retaining B’s timestamp and details.

6. **Item Delivered** (A only at 10:20:00)  
   - Not present in B. Included from System A as-is.

**Additional Notes**  
- System A is treated as the primary timeline (timestamps reflect receipt rather than start). System B’s timestamps are kept to show any offsets and preserve richer attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes).  
- Where names differ slightly but clearly describe the same business step (e.g., “Payment Processed” vs. “PaymentCheck”), events were merged.  
- Events with no reliable counterpart (Quality Check, Item Delivered) remain separate.
