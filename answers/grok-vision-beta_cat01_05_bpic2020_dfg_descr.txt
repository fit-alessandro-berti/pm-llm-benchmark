The process you've described appears to be a workflow for handling declarations or expense reports within an organization. Here's a breakdown of the process flow based on the data provided:

### Process Overview:
1. **Declaration Submission:**
   - **Employee Submission:** Declarations are initially submitted by employees. This can lead to various outcomes:
     - Approved by Administration, Budget Owner, or Pre-approver.
     - Rejected at any stage, leading back to the employee for resubmission or correction.
     - Directly approved by a Supervisor (bypassing other approvals).

2. **Approval Stages:**
   - **Administration Approval:** After submission, declarations often go through an initial approval by the administration. 
     - If approved, they can proceed to either the Budget Owner or directly to the Supervisor for final approval.
     - If rejected, they return to the employee for resubmission or further action.
   - **Budget Owner Approval:** Some declarations require approval from a Budget Owner before final approval.
     - If approved, they move to the Supervisor for final approval.
     - If rejected, they go back to the employee.
   - **Pre-approver Approval:** Some declarations might need pre-approval before going to the Supervisor.
     - If approved, they move to the Supervisor for final approval.
     - If rejected, they return to the employee.

3. **Final Approval by Supervisor:**
   - This is a critical step where the Supervisor gives the final approval. 
   - If rejected at this stage, it might go back to the employee or stay in a rejected state.

4. **Payment Request and Handling:**
   - Once a declaration is finally approved, a payment request is made.
   - Payment handling follows, where the actual payment process occurs.

5. **Rejection and Resubmission Cycle:**
   - At various stages, if a declaration is rejected, it returns to the employee. The employee can then resubmit after making necessary corrections or clarifications.

6. **Special Cases:**
   - **Missing Information:** Some declarations might be rejected due to missing information, leading to a resubmission cycle.
   - **Direct Transitions:** There are rare direct transitions like from "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" or "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER" directly to rejection due to missing information.

### Key Observations:
- **High Frequency Transitions:** The most common path involves submission, approval by administration, final approval by the supervisor, and then payment request and handling.
- **Rejection Rates:** There's a significant amount of back-and-forth due to rejections at various stages, indicating a need for thorough initial submissions or clearer guidelines.
- **Performance Metrics:** The performance metrics (likely time in seconds) suggest that the process can take a considerable amount of time, especially in cases of rejection and resubmission.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Streamline Approval Process:** Reducing the number of stages or clarifying requirements could minimize rejections.
- **Automated Checks:** Implementing automated checks for common errors before submission could reduce the rejection rate.
- **Training:** More training for employees on how to correctly fill out declarations might help in reducing the rejection frequency.

This process flow indicates a structured but potentially cumbersome approval process, with multiple checks and balances to ensure accuracy and compliance in declaration handling.
