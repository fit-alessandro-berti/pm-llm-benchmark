## 1. Anomaly Identification

Within the DECLARE model, the following conflicts and contradictions can be identified:

- **Conflict Between Precedence and Non-Coexistence:**
    - The *precedence* rule states that **"C" (Close Claim)** must be *preceded by* **"R" (Receive Claim)**, which is logical.
    - The *existence* rule mandates that **"C"** must always occur.
    - The *noncoexistence* rule asserts that **"E" (Evaluate Claim)** and **"C"** *cannot coexist* in the same trace.
    - Given the *responded existence* rule that **"E"** must always be accompanied by **"A" (Assign Adjuster)**, but because *noncoexistence* forbids **"E"** and **"C"** together, it would mean a trace either closes a claim with *no evaluation* or evaluates but is never closed, both of which are illogical in an insurance setting.

- **Unintended Execution Paths:**
    - The *existence* of **"C"** and *noncoexistence* of **"C"** and **"E"** allow claims to be *closed without ever being evaluated*.
    - The *responded existence* and *precedence* further enforce sequences that are not always compatible (e.g., you might assign and evaluate, but if that precludes close, a claim never ends).

- **Process Completeness is Undermined:**
    - There is no requirement (based on these constraints) that a claim must be evaluated before closure, which breaks the standard process logic.
    - Traces are allowed where "assign" and "evaluate" happen but are then blocked from being closed, suggesting incomplete claim resolutions.

## 2. Hypotheses Explaining the Anomalies

- **Misinterpretation of Process Rules:**  
  Constraints may reflect a misunderstanding—e.g., thinking certain activities are mutually exclusive when they should be sequential.

- **Policy Drift or Incomplete Updates:**  
  Changes to the business process might have been only partially translated into the model, leaving residual, outdated constraints.

- **Technical or Mining Errors:**  
  If constraints were derived from incomplete or noisy event logs, relationships may have been inferred erroneously.

- **Over-simplification for Performance:**  
  Rules might have been added to push claims through quickly, bypassing crucial steps like evaluation for certain categories, but this was not refined for all claim types.

## 3. SQL-Based Verification Strategies

### a) Claims Closed Without Any Evaluation

Find claims that have "C" (Close Claim) but no "E" (Evaluate Claim):

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_eval ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
WHERE
    ce_eval.event_id IS NULL;
```

---

### b) Traces Where Both "E" (Evaluate) and "C" (Close) Occur

Find claims where both evaluation and closure occurred, violating noncoexistence:

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events ce_eval ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
JOIN
    claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C';
```

---

### c) Evaluation Steps Without Corresponding Assignment

Check if every evaluation "E" is paired with an assignment ("A") for the same claim (as required by responded existence):

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT ce_eval.claim_id
FROM
    claim_events ce_eval
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_assign
    ON ce_eval.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
WHERE
    ce_eval.activity = 'E'
    AND ce_assign.event_id IS NULL;
```

---

### d) Claims Evaluated But Never Closed

Identify claims where "E" exists but "C" does not, suggesting unresolved claims:

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events ce_eval ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
WHERE
    ce_close.event_id IS NULL;
```

---

### e) Claims That Skip Evaluation Entirely

Find claims with neither assignment nor evaluation but that were still closed:

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_assign ON c.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_eval ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
WHERE
    ce_assign.event_id IS NULL
    AND ce_eval.event_id IS NULL;
```

**Summary:**  
The declared model contains core conflicts that allow process circumvention or deadlocks in cases involving evaluation and closure. The above SQL queries are designed to empirically investigate these anomalies in your database.
