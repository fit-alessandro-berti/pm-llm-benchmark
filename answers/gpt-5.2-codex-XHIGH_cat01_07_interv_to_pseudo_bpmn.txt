Below is a **BPMNlike textual process model** synthesized from the interviews. It lists participants (lanes), activities, sequence flow, gateways, artifacts, and exception paths in a form that can be converted into a BPMN diagram.

# **Process: Invoice Approval & Payment Scheduling**

**Pools/Lanes (Participants):**  
- **Supplier (External)**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**  
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**  
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
- **AP Supervisor (Rita)** *(exception handling)*  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** *(exception handling)*  
- **Accounting System** *(automated notifications)*

**Key Artifacts/Data Objects:**  
- Invoice  
- Purchase Order (PO)  
- Confirmation Email from Purchasing  
- Corrected Invoice / PO details  
- Contract/Pricing Info (used by Karen)  
- Approval Record  

---

## **Main Flow**

**Start Event:** *Invoice received (email from Supplier)*  

1. **[AP Clerk] Check invoice for PO number**  
   - *Data: Invoice*

2. **Gateway: PO present?**  
   - **No  Exception Path A (Missing PO)**  
   - **Yes  Continue**

3. **[AP Clerk] Log invoice into accounting system**  
   - *Data: Invoice + PO*

4. **[AP Clerk] Forward invoice to Purchasing for receipt & PO confirmation**  

5. **[Purchasing Officer] Compare invoice to PO (qty, price, delivery charges) and confirm goods/services received**  
   - *Data: Invoice + PO*

6. **Gateway: Invoice matches PO & receipt confirmed?**  
   - **No  Exception Path B (Discrepancy)**  
   - **Yes  Continue**

7. **[Purchasing Officer] Send confirmation email to Accounts Payable**  
   - *Artifact: Confirmation Email*

8. **[AP Clerk] Match invoice line items to PO in system**  

9. **Gateway: Discrepancy found by AP?**  
   - **Yes  Exception Path C (AP discrepancy)**  
   - **No  Continue**

10. **[Accounting System] Send approval request to Department Manager**  
    - *Automatic email notification*

11. **[Department Manager] Review invoice + PO + confirmation**  

12. **Gateway: Manager approves?**  
   - **No  Exception Path D (Manager rejection/hold)**  
   - **Yes  Continue**

13. **[Department Manager] Approve invoice in system**  

14. **[AP Clerk] Schedule invoice for payment run**  

**End Event:** *Invoice scheduled for payment*

## **Exception / Alternate Paths**

### **Exception Path A — Missing PO**
- **[AP Clerk] Request PO details / corrected invoice from Supplier**  
- **[Supplier Relationship Manager] (Optional) Contact supplier to obtain PO or verify contract terms**  
- **Gateway: PO obtained?**  
  - **Yes  return to “Log invoice into system”**  
  - **No  [AP Supervisor] Decide: create retrospective PO OR reject invoice**  
    - **If retrospective PO created  return to “Log invoice”**  
    - **If rejected  End Event: Invoice rejected**

---

### **Exception Path B — Purchasing Discrepancy**
- **[Purchasing Officer] Contact supplier or ask AP to hold invoice**  
- **[Supplier Relationship Manager] (Optional) Resolve pricing/terms discrepancies**  
- **[AP Supervisor] (If unresolved) coordinate resolution or create retrospective PO**  
- **Loop back to “Compare invoice to PO” once corrected/clarified**  

---

### **Exception Path C — AP LineItem Discrepancy**
- **[AP Clerk] Clarify with Purchasing**  
- **[AP Supervisor] (If unresolved) coordinate with supplier or departments**  
- **Loop back to “Match invoice line items”**

---

### **Exception Path D — Manager Rejects / Holds**
- **[Department Manager] Reject/hold and request investigation**  
- **[AP Clerk / AP Supervisor / Purchasing / SRM] Investigate and resolve**  
- **Loop back to “Manager Review” once resolved**

---

## **Notes / Uncertainties**
- In some cases the **Purchasing Officer contacts suppliers directly**, and in other cases **Supplier Relationship Manager** is looped in for contract or pricing verification.  
- If an invoice is for services without a formal PO, **AP Supervisor may create a retrospective PO** or recommend rejection.  
- Manager rejection is rare but initiates a loop back to AP/Purchasing for clarification.

This model captures the typical sequence, decision points, roles, artifacts, and exception handling described across the interviews and can be directly transformed into a BPMN diagram.
