Looking at the sequences side by side, the only structural difference is in how “cultural fit” is treated. In the GroupA cases, cultural fit is simply the score coming out of the assessment. In the GroupB cases, candidates who belong to the “LocalBusinessLeadersClub” are given an extra five points on that same measure.

That has two effects:

- It is not tied to any jobrelated criterion. Two candidates with the same skills and personality can end up with different cultural fit totals solely because one happens to belong to a particular association. For example, P002 and U001 both sit at 60 on raw cultural fit; P002 is “Not Hired”, whereas U001 is boosted to 65 and “Hired”.

- The boost only appears on the unprotected group’s log. In your synthetic data, none of the protected cases ever receives the +5 adjustment, so membership in the local club functions as a gatekeeper that a protected candidate is unlikely to pass. That creates both disparate treatment (you are explicitly adjusting scores for some and not others) and disparate impact if club membership correlates with residence, socioeconomic status, or other demographic traits.

The implication for fairness and equity is that you no longer have a level playing field. Candidates are being advantaged based on a characteristic that is unrelated to their ability to do the job and may systematically exclude members of certain groups. Over time this kind of practice can skew hiring outcomes, reduce diversity, and expose the organisation to legal and ethical challenges. A fairer process would use consistent, jobrelevant criteria for all candidates and avoid arbitrary adjustments tied to associations that not everyone can access.
