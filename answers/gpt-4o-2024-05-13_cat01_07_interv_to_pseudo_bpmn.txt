     - **No:** Handle Discrepancy

7. **Send Confirmation (if match):**

### **Exceptions/Variations:**
- If PO details are missing or incorrect, the AP Clerk requests more information from the supplier.
- If discrepancies in invoice and PO details (quantity, pricing, etc.) arise, the issue may be resolved by contacting the supplier or escalating to the AP Supervisor.
- Informal or service-based invoices without POs might require retrospective creation of a PO or rejection, as coordinated by the AP Supervisor.
