### **Explanation of Transformation Logic**

1. **Case Identification:**
   - Each case represents a logical unit of work centered around a specific document, email, or file (e.g., `Document1.docx`, `Email - Inbox`, `Report_Draft.pdf`).
   - Cases are grouped by the primary object being worked on (e.g., document, email, spreadsheet).
   - Switches between applications (e.g., `SWITCH` events) often indicate a transition to a new case, unless it’s a temporary context switch (e.g., checking an email while drafting a document). In such cases, events are tied to the primary document.

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - Low-level actions (e.g., `TYPING`, `CLICK`, `SCROLL`) are aggregated into higher-level activities (e.g., "Edit Document," "Review Email").
   - Repetitive actions within the same window are merged into a single activity (e.g., multiple `TYPING` events become "Edit Document").
   - System actions (e.g., `FOCUS`, `SAVE`, `CLOSE`) are mapped to meaningful steps like "Open Document," "Save Document," etc.

3. **Additional Context:**
   - The "Keys" or "Action" fields from the raw log are preserved as additional context (e.g., "Draft intro paragraph" in "Edit Document").
   - The "Resource" column shows the specific window (e.g., `Document1.docx`) to distinguish between multiple instances of the same application.

4. **Handling Switches:**
   - When the user switches between applications, events are assigned to the active case (e.g., switching back to `Document1.docx` continues the same case).
   - Temporary interactions (e.g., opening an email) are treated as separate cases unless they are directly tied to the primary task (e.g., referencing email content in a document could be merged, but here they are separate).

5. **Coherent Narrative:**
   The event log now tells a story of the user’s work session:
   - They started editing `Document1.docx`, saved it, then checked emails (replying to one), reviewed a PDF, updated an Excel spreadsheet, and returned to `Document1.docx` to add a reference before closing it.
   - They then opened and edited `Quarterly_Report.docx` before closing it.

This transformation enables process mining analysis to reveal patterns like:
- Common sequences of activities (e.g., editing documents  checking emails  reviewing PDFs).
- Time spent on different document types.
- Frequent switches between applications (interruptions or multitasking).

The log is now in a format compatible with tools like **ProM** or **Celonis**.
