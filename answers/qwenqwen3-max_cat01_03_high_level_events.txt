Based on the provided event log sample, I have analyzed the sequence, timing, resource types, and semantic meaning of the low-level activities to derive coherent, high-level process steps. Below is the structured output.

### **Proposed High-Level Activities**

| High-Level Activity Name | Included Low-Level Activities                                                                 | Rationale for Grouping |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **1. Material Preparation** | - Retrieve raw metal sheet<br>- Scan barcode<br>- Place metal sheet on table<br>- Align metal sheet<br>- Preheat metal sheet | These activities occur at the very beginning of each case and involve setting up the raw material for subsequent processing. They are performed in close temporal proximity (within ~15 seconds), involve human operators and automated alignment/heating systems, and collectively transform raw stock into a ready-to-process workpiece. Scanning ensures traceability, while alignment and preheating are preparatory physical conditioning steps. |
| **2. Structural Assembly (Welding)** | - Pick up welding tool<br>- Weld corner A<br>- Weld corner B | These events represent the core physical joining operation. The tool pickup immediately precedes the welding actions, indicating intent and setup for assembly. Both welds are performed consecutively by the same operator using the same tool type, targeting specific structural points (“corner A/B”), and form a discrete assembly subtask. |
| **3. In-Process Quality Verification** | - Measure weld integrity | This is a dedicated automated quality check performed immediately after welding, using a quality sensor to validate structural integrity. It occurs before any downstream finishing steps, making it an *in-process* verification rather than final inspection. Its isolated nature and specific purpose justify a separate high-level step focused on quality assurance at a critical control point. |
| **4. Surface Finishing** | - Apply protective coating<br>- Dry coating | These two steps form a cohesive surface treatment phase. Coating application is followed directly by a drying/curing step using controlled heat. Both are performed by dedicated finishing equipment (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2) and serve the shared objective of applying and setting a protective layer. |
| **5. Final Visual Inspection** | - Visual check | Conducted at the very end of the process by a human operator (Operator C), this step serves as the final pass/fail gate before the item moves to packaging or shipping. It is distinct from automated checks and represents human oversight of the completed product. |

*(Same mapping applies to Case B2 due to identical pattern.)*

### **Key Grouping Principles Applied**

1. **Temporal Cohesion**: Events occurring in rapid succession without intervening unrelated actions were grouped (e.g., the five initial steps all happen within 15 seconds).
2. **Functional Purpose**: Activities serving the same manufacturing objective (e.g., preparing material, joining parts, applying finish) were clustered.
3. **Resource & Tool Context**: Shared tools (e.g., welding tool W-12) or resource types (e.g., quality sensors vs. human operators) helped delineate phases.
4. **Process Logic & Flow**: The sequence follows a natural manufacturing progression: prepare  assemble  verify  finish  inspect.
5. **Quality Checkpoints**: Automated and manual inspections were separated based on timing (in-process vs. final) and method (sensor vs. human).

### **Final List of High-Level Process Steps (in Order)**

1. **Material Preparation**  
2. **Structural Assembly (Welding)**  
3. **In-Process Quality Verification**  
4. **Surface Finishing**  
5. **Final Visual Inspection**

This abstraction reduces 12 low-level events per case into 5 meaningful, interpretable stages—enabling clearer process monitoring, bottleneck analysis, and compliance tracking in the manufacturing workflow.
