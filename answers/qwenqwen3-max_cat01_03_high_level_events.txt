### High-Level Process Steps for Manufacturing Workflow

Based on the event log sample, I identified **four coherent high-level process steps** that encapsulate the low-level events. These groupings are based on:
- **Temporal proximity** (events occur in tight sequence),
- **Functional/logical cohesion** (events serve a unified sub-goal),
- **Resource consistency or handoff patterns** (e.g., operator  robot  sensor),
- **Manufacturing domain knowledge** (typical phases: prep  assembly  finishing  inspection).

## 1. **Material Preparation & Setup**

**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
These events occur at the very start of each case and are focused on getting the raw material ready for processing. They involve staging (placing on table), identification (scanning), positioning (alignment), and conditioning (preheating) — all classic preparation activities. The resource transitions from Operator A to Robot Arm #2 to Heating Unit #1 are typical of setup automation. No value is added to the product yet; this is purely preparatory.

**Temporal Pattern:**
Events occur within the first 15–20 seconds of the case, tightly clustered.

## 2. **Welding Assembly**

**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
This group represents the core value-adding transformation step — physically joining components (in this case, welding corners). The tool pickup is logically part of the assembly step (as it immediately precedes the welds and is performed by the same operator). The repetition of “Weld corner A/B” suggests a standard sub-assembly routine. This is distinct from preparation and finishing, and occurs after preheating but before any coating or inspection.

**Resource Consistency:**
All performed by Operator B — indicating a discrete work assignment.

## 3. **Surface Finishing & Curing**

**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
These events represent post-assembly surface treatment — a finishing stage. The coating application is followed immediately by a controlled drying/curing process, often in manufacturing treated as a single “finishing” phase. The transition from Coating Unit #3 to Heating Unit #2 indicates an automated finishing line. This step adds protective value but is distinct from structural assembly.

**Temporal & Functional Cohesion:**
Occurs after welding and before final inspection; functionally focused on surface integrity rather than structural integrity.

---

## 4. **Final Quality Verification**

**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
These are both inspection/verification activities — one automated (sensor measurement) and one manual (operator visual check). They occur at the end of the process and serve the same goal: validating that the product meets quality standards before moving to next stage or shipping. Grouping them acknowledges that quality assurance often combines automated and human checks.

**Logical Endpoint:**
These are the last two events in each case, forming a natural “gate” before case completion.

## Summary

This aggregation reduces 12 low-level events into **4 meaningful, domain-relevant high-level process steps**, enabling easier process monitoring, bottleneck analysis, and performance reporting. The groupings respect temporal, functional, and resource-based boundaries inherent in the manufacturing workflow.

This structure can now be applied consistently across the full event log to abstract granular data into actionable process insights.
