The model adds several rules to limit biased decision-making as follows:

1.  **Bias Mitigation Check:** The rules for biassed decission making between sensitive attributes and the final discourse are to perform a bias mitigation check after the sensitive event occuring or after any event leading to final discourse.
2.  **Coexist Manual Review:** Decisions against sensitive applicants should be checked more thoroughly by a manual review, monitoring the decision style to ensure no slant left on the minority properties.
3.  **Avoid specialch fir Accept or Rejection:** 2 checks preventing reviewing applicant race or having manual review after them and still giving possibility to judge by race
