### 1. **Identifying Issues with the Current Model**

The current process tree model uses a **parallel (AND) block** after the requisition approval, which allows the following five activities to occur in **any order**:

- Create Purchase Order
- Receive Goods
- Receive Invoice
- Match Invoice to PO
- Pay Invoice

This is **semantically incorrect** and leads to **unwanted behavior**, such as:

- Paying the invoice before receiving goods or even before receiving the invoice.
- Matching the invoice before the purchase order is created.
- Receiving goods or invoice before the purchase order exists.
- Matching invoice without having received both the goods and the invoice.

In a real-world “Procure-to-Pay” process, the following **causal and logical dependencies** must be enforced:

- **Create Purchase Order** must happen **after** requisition approval, and **before** any downstream activities (goods receipt, invoice receipt, matching, payment).
- **Receive Goods** and **Receive Invoice** can occur in **either order** (goods may arrive before invoice or vice versa), but **both must occur before matching**.
- **Match Invoice to PO** requires the PO, the received goods (for 3-way match), and the invoice — so it must occur **after all three**.
- **Pay Invoice** must occur **after matching** (to ensure validity and control).
- **Close Case** must occur **after payment**.

Thus, the only legitimate concurrency is between **Receive Goods** and **Receive Invoice** — all other steps must be strictly sequenced.

### 2. **Corrected Process Tree Model**

Here is the **fixed process tree** that enforces the correct Procure-to-Pay flow:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Allow Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice to occur in any order (parallel)
receive_concurrently = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice
])

# Sequence: after PO, receive goods & invoice (in any order), then match, then pay
post_po_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_po,
    receive_concurrently,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice
])

# Overall sequence: Requisition  Approval  PO & downstream  Close
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    post_po_sequence,
    close_case
])
```

### 3. **Explanation: How the Updated Model Ensures Correct Behavior**

The revised model enforces the following **strict ordering** while allowing only **one legitimate concurrency**:

 **Sequence 1: Requisition Flow**
- `Create_Purchase_Requisition`  `Approve_Purchase_Requisition`
  - Ensures no PO is created without a validated need.

 **Sequence 2: Purchase Order First**
- `Create_Purchase_Order` must occur next — no goods or invoices should be processed without a PO.

 **Concurrency: Goods & Invoice Receipt**
- `Receive_Goods`  `Receive_Invoice` (parallel)
  - These two are allowed to occur in any order, as business reality permits either to arrive first. This is the **only valid parallelism** in the core P2P flow.

 **Sequence 3: Matching Requires Both**
- `Match_Invoice_to_PO` only occurs **after** both receipt activities — ensuring a 3-way match (PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice) is possible.

 **Sequence 4: Payment After Validation**
- `Pay_Invoice` only after matching — enforcing financial control.

 **Sequence 5: Closure After Payment**
- `Close_Case` only after payment — finalizing the procurement cycle.

###  **Prevented Unwanted Behaviors**

The fixed model **disallows**:

- Paying before matching  prevented by sequence.
- Matching before receiving goods or invoice  prevented by placing match after the parallel receipt block.
- Receiving goods/invoice before PO  prevented by sequencing PO first.
- Closing before payment  prevented by final sequence step.

---

###  **Summary**

The corrected model retains all original activities but replaces the overly permissive parallel block with a **structured sequence** that includes **one controlled parallel block** (for goods/invoice receipt). This accurately reflects domain logic and eliminates semantically invalid traces while preserving necessary flexibility.

This model now **precisely fits** the intended Procure-to-Pay process.
