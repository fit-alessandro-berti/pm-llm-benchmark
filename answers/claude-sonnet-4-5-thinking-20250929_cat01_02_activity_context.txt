# Analysis and Renamed Event Log

## 1. Identification of Recurring Activities and Contextual Differences

### **Activities with Multiple Occurrences:**

**A. Verify Documents** (appears twice in C001 and C003)
- **Context 1**: Initial verification of submitted documents
- **Context 2**: Re-verification after additional information is provided or account adjustments are made

**B. Call Customer** (appears twice in C002, once each in C001 and C003)
- **Context 1 (C001)**: Requesting missing documentation
- **Context 2 (C002 - first call)**: Clarifying account discrepancies
- **Context 3 (C002 - second call)**: Confirming completed adjustments
- **Context 4 (C003)**: Requesting customer to return to branch

**C. Initiate Request** (appears in all cases but through different channels)
- **Context 1 (C001, C002)**: Online portal submission
- **Context 2 (C003)**: In-person walk-in at branch

## 4. Justification for Naming Choices

### **A. Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification / Re-verify Documents After Update**

**Contextual Clues:**
- **Temporal position**: First occurrence happens early in the process flow
- **Additional context**: 
  - First occurrence describes "checks identity documents" or "identity verification"
  - Second occurrence explicitly states "re-checks" (C001) or occurs after "account adjustment" (C003)
- **Preceding activity**: Re-verification is always preceded by either "Submit Additional" or "Adjust Account"

**Rationale**: Distinguishing initial checks from re-checks clarifies process loops and rework patterns. This is critical for process mining metrics like rework rates and cycle time analysis.

---

### **B. Call Customer  Four distinct variants**

**Contextual Clues:**
- **C001 - Request Missing Documents**: Context states "verification incomplete" and "request missing docs"
- **C002 - Clarify Discrepancy**: Context mentions "clarify account discrepancy"
- **C002 - Confirm Adjustments**: Context states "confirm adjustments made" and follows "Adjust Account"
- **C003 - Request Return to Branch**: Context notes "customer stepped out" and "have them return"

**Rationale**: Each call serves a fundamentally different purpose in the workflow:
1. **Request Missing Documents**: Reactive, information-gathering
2. **Clarify Discrepancy**: Problem-solving, two-way discussion
3. **Confirm Adjustments**: Proactive, customer service follow-up
4. **Request Return to Branch**: Logistical coordination

These distinctions are essential for analyzing customer interaction patterns, agent performance, and process bottlenecks.

---

### **C. Initiate Request  Initiate Request (Online Portal) / Initiate Request (Branch Walk-in)**

**Contextual Clues:**
- **Resource field**: "WebPortal" vs. "BranchReception"
- **Additional context**: "online portal" vs. "walk-in customer at branch"

**Rationale**: Channel differentiation affects downstream processing (e.g., physical vs. digital document verification) and is valuable for channel performance analysis and customer segmentation.

---

### **D. Activities Left Unchanged**

**Approve Request**: Appears only once per case with identical meaning (final supervisor approval).

**Submit Additional**: Appears only once in C001, no ambiguity.

**Adjust Account**: Appears in C002 and C003 but both represent internal corrections by BackOfficeAgent. While contexts differ slightly, the core activity (internal data adjustment) is consistent enough to maintain the same label.

---

## Summary

The renamed activities now explicitly capture:
- **Sequential context** (Initial vs. Re-verification)
- **Purpose/intent** (different types of customer calls)
- **Channel differences** (online vs. branch initiation)

This disambiguation enables more accurate process discovery, bottleneck identification, and performance analysis while preserving the semantic meaning of each activity within its specific context.
