The visualization is a process flow diagram illustrating different business processes related to order and invoice management. It shows the steps involved in handling vendor invoices, return orders, purchase requisitions, sales orders, and purchase orders.

Each process starts with a "Start" node and progresses through various steps represented by rectangular boxes. Arrows indicate the flow direction and are labeled with estimated processing times in milliseconds (ms). Some steps also show an "Overall" number, likely representing the total count or volume associated with that step.

The diagram is organized horizontally, with distinct process flows originating from different "Start" points. These flows represent:

* **Vendor Invoice Item:** Starts and leads to "Send Order" and "Check Stock" before reaching an "End".
* **Return Order Item:** Starts and connects to "Approve Requisition".
* **Purchase Requisition Item:** Starts and progresses through "Create Requisition" and "Approve Requisition".
* **Sales Order Item:** Starts and flows through "Create Order", "Pack Goods", "Ship Goods", "Confirm Delivery", and "Close Order".
* **Purchase Order Item:** Starts and connects directly to "Create Order".

Several steps within different processes are interconnected, indicating dependencies or shared activities. For example, "Approve Requisition" is linked to "Send Order", "Check Stock", and "Process Return". "Create Invoice" is connected to "Check Stock" and "Approve Payment".

The visualization uses different colored lines for some connections, which might represent different types of relationships or flows, although a legend is not provided. Small colored circles within some boxes likely represent different status points or categories within that step.

The diagram terminates with multiple "End" nodes, signifying the completion of various process paths. The estimated processing times on the arrows provide an indication of the duration between steps.
