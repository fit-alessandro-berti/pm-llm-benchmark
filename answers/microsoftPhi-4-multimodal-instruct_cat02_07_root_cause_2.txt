To complete this task, let's first analyze the data provided.

**Step 1: Identify Cases with Long Duration**

From the provided event log, we can calculate the duration between consecutive operations for each case:

- **Case 2001 (Low complexity, Region A) duration:**
  - Total duration: From 09:00 to 10:30 (1 hour and 30 minutes) (Processes: Submit Claim, Evaluate Claim, Approve Claim, Pay Claim, Close Claim)

- **Case 2002 (Medium complexity, Region B) duration:**
  - Total duration: From 09:05 to 11:00 (17 hours and 55 minutes) (Processes: Submit Claim, Evaluate Claim, Request Additional Documents, Approve Claim, Pay Claim, Close Claim)

- **Case 2003 (High complexity, Region A) duration:**
  - Total duration: From 09:10 to 03:00 (the next day) (23 hours and 50 minutes) (Processes: Submit Claim, Evaluate Claim, Request Additional Documents, Approve Claim, Pay Claim, Close Claim)

- **Case 2004 (Low complexity, Region B) duration:**
  - Total duration: From 09:20 to 10:45 (5 hours and 25 minutes) (Processes: Submit Claim, Evaluate Claim, Approve Claim, Pay Claim, Close Claim)

- **Case 2005 (High complexity, Region B) duration:**
  - Total duration: From 09:25 to 14:30 (25 hours and 5 minutes) (Processes: Submit Claim, Evaluate Claim, Request Additional Documents, Request Additional Documents, Request Additional Documents, Approve Claim, Pay Claim, Close Claim)

Cases 2002 and 2005, with durations of 17 hours and 55 minutes and 25 hours and 5 minutes respectively, are significantly longer than cases 2001, 2003, and 2004.

**Step 2: Analyze Attributes for Potential Root Causes**

- **Resource:**
  - None of the cases seem to attribute long duration to a specific individual; adjustments or time keeping for individual resources are not evident in the provided data.

- **Region:**
  - No single region (A or B) has all long or short durations, suggesting region is not a distinguishing factor.

- **Complexity:**
  - High complexity cases, 2003 and 2005, have significantly higher durations than low complexity cases. This may imply that complexity is a contributing factor.

- Additional Documents:
  - Cases 2002, 2005, and 2003 have multiple requests for additional documents. In fact, case 2005 has a total of three requests before funding is approved, significantly contributing to the extended duration.

**Step 3: Propose Explanations and Mitigation Strategies**

- **Complexity:**
  - High complexity cases typically involve more detailed assessments, which naturally take longer. To mitigate this, consider dedicating more resources to high complexity cases or implementing an escalated process where an experienced team member is assigned to such cases.

- **Additional Document Requests:**
  - Multiple requests for additional documents appear to slow down the process. Streamlining the information gathering phase for complexity levels by creating more thorough initial evaluations, conducting training, or offering clear guidelines for what constitutes an additional document might help reduce such requests.
  - Introduce a process check or an automated system to ensure all necessary details for specific claim types have been gathered before proceeding.

- **Process Optimization:**
  - For cases that are particularly long, it may be beneficial to investigate them further outside the automated duration analysis. Looking into each case's specific workflow and identifying steps that consistently take longer than average could uncover process inefficiencies or additional supportive measures that could be introduced.
  
- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - Establish a performance monitoring system to regularly review process times and raise flags when they fall outside of acceptable benchmarks. This can help in early detection of performance issues.
  
- **Staff Training and Change Management:**
  - Any change to process might require staff training to ensure they understand new procedures and timelines; for example, if resources are allocated differently or automated systems are used to manage document requests.
  
- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Establish a continuous improvement program where staff can submit suggestions for procedure optimizations, and where possible, small-scale tests (A/B testing) can be conducted to measure and compare different approaches.

To conclude, for cases 2002 and 2005 that show marked performance issues, complexity and multiple additional document requests are contributing factors, with complexity also potentially bearing a more significant impact given total duration times. Mitigation efforts should focus on resources, process efficiency, and clarity regarding documentation. Investigations with more granular data on resource allocation and process timing can also provide vital information for more targeted improvements.
