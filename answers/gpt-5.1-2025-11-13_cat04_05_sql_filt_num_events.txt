You can do this with a subquery (or CTE) that counts events per case, then join back to the original table:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS c
ON e.case_id = c.case_id;
```

Explanation of the steps:

1. The inner query:
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
   ```
   calculates the number of events per `case_id` and keeps only those with 6 or fewer events.

2. The outer query joins back to `event_log` on `case_id` to return all events belonging to the selected cases.
