Justification of renaming choices
1. Verify Documents  
   • Initial Document Verification – first time documents are checked in the case.  
   • Follow-up / Post-Adjustment Document Verification – second check occurs only after the case has changed (extra documents were supplied or the account was adjusted). The name signals that this verification is dependent on a previous corrective action.  
   • Initial Document Verification (Branch) – keeps the “initial” meaning but highlights the branch context where walk-ins differ from online requests.

2. Call Customer  
   • Call – Request Additional Documents – purpose is to obtain more paperwork.  
   • Call – Clarify Account Discrepancy – purpose is investigative clarification before an internal adjustment.  
   • Call – Confirm Adjustments – purpose is confirmation after an internal change.  
   • Call – Recall Customer to Branch – purpose is logistical (getting the customer physically back to the branch).  
   Prefixing with “Call –” conserves the original activity family while the suffix states the unique intent.

With these descriptive names, process-mining tools (and human readers) can now distinguish between checks, follow-ups, investigative calls and confirmation calls, revealing loops and decision points that were hidden when every repetition shared the same generic label.
