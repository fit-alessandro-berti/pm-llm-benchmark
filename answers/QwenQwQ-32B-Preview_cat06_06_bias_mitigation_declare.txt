To address the potential bias in the loan application review process, I will introduce several new constraints into the existing DECLARE model. These constraints aim to ensure that decisions are made fairly and without direct influence from sensitive attributes such as applicant age, gender, or race.

### New Constraints to Mitigate Bias

1. **Coexistence of Manual Review with Sensitive Decisions:**
   - **Constraint Type:** `coexistence`
   - **Activities Involved:** `FinalDecision` and `ManualReview`
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that any final decision involving applicants from sensitive demographics is accompanied by a manual review, promoting fairness and consistency.

2. **Response Constraints for Bias Mitigation:**
   - **Constraint Type:** `response`
   - **Activities Involved:** `CheckApplicantSensitiveAttribute` to `BiasMitigationCheck`
   - **Rationale:** Requires that after checking sensitive attributes, a bias mitigation check is performed before making any decision.

3. **Non-Succession Constraints to Prevent Direct Bias:**
   - **Constraint Type:** `nonsuccession`
   - **Activities Involved:** `CheckApplicantSensitiveAttribute` to `FinalDecision`
   - **Rationale:** Prevents direct transitions from checking sensitive attributes to making a final decision without intermediate steps like bias mitigation checks.

4. **Altresponse for Diverse Decision Paths:**
   - **Constraint Type:** `altresponse`
   - **Activities Involved:** `StartApplication` to either `RequestAdditionalInfo` or `BiasMitigationCheck`
   - **Rationale:** Allows for multiple paths after starting an application, ensuring that sensitive attributes can trigger specific checks without directly leading to biased decisions.

### Updated DECLARE Model

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "CheckApplicantSensitiveAttribute": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}, "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantSensitiveAttribute": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Coexistence of Manual Review with Sensitive Decisions:**
   - By ensuring that `FinalDecision` coexists with `ManualReview`, we introduce a layer of oversight that can help catch and mitigate any biases that might influence decision-making.

2. **Response Constraints for Bias Mitigation:**
   - The `response` constraint from `CheckApplicantSensitiveAttribute` to `BiasMitigationCheck` ensures that whenever sensitive attributes are checked, a bias mitigation step is performed before any final decision is made. This helps to prevent direct and immediate bias based on sensitive information.

3. **Non-Succession Constraints to Prevent Direct Bias:**
   - The `nonsuccession` constraint between `CheckApplicantSensitiveAttribute` and `FinalDecision` prevents the process from directly transitioning from checking sensitive attributes to making a final decision without involving intermediate steps like bias mitigation checks.

4. **Altresponse for Diverse Decision Paths:**
   - The `altresponse` constraint allows for multiple possible responses after starting an application, including both requesting additional information and performing bias mitigation checks. This flexibility ensures that sensitive attributes can be appropriately addressed without leading to biased outcomes.

By implementing these constraints, the loan application review process is made more and consistent, reducing the potential for bias based on sensitive attributes.
