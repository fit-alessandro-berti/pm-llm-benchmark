**Solution:**

To address the potential bias in the loan application review process, we need to introduce new DECLARE constraints that ensure fairness and prevent discrimination based on sensitive attributes such as ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, and ApplicantRace. The goal is to modify the existing DECLARE model to include these constraints effectively.

### Updated DECLARE Model

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **Approve_Minority and ManualReview:**
     - Ensures that whenever a decision to approve an application from a minority applicant is made, a manual review must also occur. This helps to verify that the approval is not based on biased criteria.
   - **Reject_Minority and ManualReview:**
     - Similarly, ensures that any rejection of an application from a minority applicant is accompanied by a manual review, preventing potential bias in rejection decisions.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace and BiasMitigationCheck:**
     - Requires that after checking the applicant's race, a bias mitigation check must be performed before proceeding to any decision. This step helps to ensure that decisions are not directly influenced by racial information without proper review.

3. **Succession Constraints:**
   - **BiasMitigationCheck and FinalDecision:**
     - Ensures that after performing a bias mitigation check, the final decision is made. This enforces that decisions are based on checked and mitigated information, reducing the risk of bias.

4. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace and Reject:**
     - Prevents the direct succession from checking the applicant's race to rejecting the application, ensuring that no immediate biased rejection occurs based on race.
   - **CheckApplicantAge and Reject:**
     - Similarly, prevents direct rejection based on age without intermediate steps.
   - **CheckApplicantGender and Reject:**
     - Prevents direct rejection based on gender without additional review.

These constraints collectively aim to introduce checks and balances in the process, ensuring that decisions are not made hastily based on sensitive attributes and that manual reviews are conducted when necessary to mitigate potential bias. By enforcing these rules, the process becomes more transparent and fair, reducing the likelihood of discriminatory outcomes.
