 Based on the provided description, here are the two POWL models representing GlobalTeq Solutions' hiring process.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model includes an XOR branch after the skill assessment that can lead to an unfair advantage for applicants with local community affiliations or specific educational backgrounds.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR choice after skill assessment
cultural_fit_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the partial order and add edges to maintain the execution order
hiring_process_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, data_loop, SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_choice, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
hiring_process_unfair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
hiring_process_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
hiring_process_unfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_choice)
hiring_process_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_choice, ManagerialReview)
hiring_process_unfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model ensures that all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process without any special community-based branch.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the partial order and add edges to maintain the execution order
hiring_process_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, data_loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
hiring_process_fair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
hiring_process_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
hiring_process_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
hiring_process_fair.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
hiring_process_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

In both models, the loop ensures data completeness, and the sequential ordering of tasks is maintained. The difference lies in the XOR branch: in the first model, there's a choice between a standard cultural fit evaluation and a community affiliation check that could introduce bias, while in the second model, all applicants are evaluated uniformly with no special path providing an unfair advantage.
