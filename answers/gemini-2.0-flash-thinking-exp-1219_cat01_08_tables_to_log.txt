The user wants to generate an event log from several tables representing business processes. The goal is to trace the lifecycle of each order.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Identify the core entity and the case ID**: The `order_id` is the case ID.
2. **Determine activities and their timestamps from each table**:
    - `Orders`: "Order Created" (timestamp: `order_date`, resource: `sales_person_id`)
    - `Order Lines`: "Items Picked" (timestamp: `item_picking_date`, resource: `picker_id`). Since there can be multiple items picked at different times, we need one "Items Picked" event per line.
    - `Delivery`: "Order Dispatched" (timestamp: `delivery_dispatch_date`, resource: `carrier_id`), "Order Arrived" (timestamp: `delivery_arrival_date`, resource: `carrier_id`).
    - `Invoice`: "Invoice Issued" (timestamp: `invoice_issue_date`, resource: `billing_person_id`).
    - `Payments`: "Payment Received" (timestamp: `payment_date`). We need to join this with the `Invoice` table to get the `order_id`.
3. **Combine the data**: Use `order_id` and other relevant keys to link the events.
4. **Order events chronologically**: Sort the events by timestamp within each `order_id`.
5. **Include additional attributes**: Bring in relevant information from the tables.
6. **Format the output**: Present the event log in Markdown table format.

Let's go through each table and extract the relevant information for the event log.

**Orders Table:**
- Activity: "Order Created"
- Timestamp: `order_date`
- Case ID: `order_id`
- Resource: `sales_person_id`
- Other Attributes: `customer_id`, `customer_type`, `order_priority`

**Order Lines Table:**
- Activity: "Items Picked"
- Timestamp: `item_picking_date`
- Case ID: `order_id`
- Resource: `picker_id`
- Other Attributes: `item_id`, `quantity`

**Delivery Table:**
- Activity: "Order Dispatched"
- Timestamp: `delivery_dispatch_date`
- Case ID: `order_id`
- Resource: `carrier_id`
- Other Attributes: `delivery_id`, `delivery_note`

- Activity: "Order Arrived"
- Timestamp: `delivery_arrival_date`
- Case ID: `order_id`
- Resource: `carrier_id`
- Other Attributes: `delivery_id`, `delivery_note`

**Invoice Table:**
- Activity: "Invoice Issued"
- Timestamp: `invoice_issue_date`
- Case ID: `order_id`
- Resource: `billing_person_id`
- Other Attributes: `invoice_id`, `invoice_amount`

**Payments Table:**
- Activity: "Payment Received"
- Timestamp: `payment_date`
- Case ID: Needs to be joined via `invoice_id` to the `Invoice` table.
- Other Attributes: `payment_id`, `payment_method`, `payment_reference`

Now, let's iterate through each `order_id` and construct the event log.
