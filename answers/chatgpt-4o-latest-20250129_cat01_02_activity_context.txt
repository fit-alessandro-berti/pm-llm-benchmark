### **Justification for Renaming:**

1. **"Verify Documents" → More Specific Verification Names**
   - The document verification steps occurred at different points in the process and served different purposes. 
   - **"Initial Document Verification"** (C001, C003) captures the first review of ID documents.
   - **"Final Document Verification"** (C001) clarifies that this is a re-check after additional documents were provided.
   - **"Identity Verification"** (C002) clarifies that the purpose of the document check is to verify identity, separate from the final approval.
   - **"Post-Adjustment Document Verification"** (C003) ensures the reader understands that this verification happened after an account correction.

2. **"Call Customer" → Different Types of Calls**
   - The "Call Customer" activity occurred for different reasons:
     - **"Customer Follow-up Call (Missing Docs)"** (C001) reflects the agent requesting missing documents.
     - **"Customer Inquiry Call (Discrepancy)"** (C002) clarifies that the purpose was to discuss an account discrepancy.
     - **"Confirmation Call (Account Change)"** (C002) emphasizes it was a follow-up regarding an account adjustment.
     - **"Customer Return Call"** (C003) describes an attempt to get a customer back to the branch.

3. **"Submit Additional" → "Submit Additional Documents"**
   - The original term "Submit Additional" was ambiguous. The updated name clarifies that the customer is providing more documents.

4. **"Adjust Account" → "Internal Account Adjustment"**
   - This activity was renamed to clarify that it refers to internal adjustments made by the back-office team rather than customer-initiated actions.

---

### **Impact of These Changes:**
- The event log now clearly distinguishes between similar-sounding activities.
- Each renamed activity clarifies what is happening at different points in the workflow.
- This makes process analysis and automation easier, as it reduces ambiguity.
