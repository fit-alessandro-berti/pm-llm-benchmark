### Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors in the Event Log

#### 1. Early or Out-of-Order Activities
- **Example:** In `case_id 1002`, the `Confirm Shipment` activity (event_id 9) occurred before the `Perform Credit Check` (event_id 11) and `Validate Stock` (event_id 12) activities.
  - **Hypothesis:** This could be due to a system error, procedural error, or a manual override by a Logistics Manager.
  - **Investigation Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT e1.case_id, e1.event_id, e1.activity AS early_activity, e1.timestamp AS early_timestamp,
           e2.event_id AS delayed_event_id, e2.activity AS delayed_activity, e2.timestamp AS delayed_timestamp
    FROM order_event_log e1
    JOIN order_event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id
    WHERE e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp AND e1.event_id < e2.event_id
    ORDER BY e1.case_id, e1.event_id;
    ```

#### 2. Missing Activities
- **Example:** In `case_id 1003`, the `Validate Stock` activity (event_id 17) is missing.
  - **Hypothesis:** This could be due to a system failure, human error, or a skipped step in the process.
  - **Investigation Query:**
    ```sql
    WITH expected_activities AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT activity
        FROM order_event_log
    ),
    actual_activities AS (
        SELECT case_id, activity
        FROM order_event_log
    )
    SELECT e.case_id, ea.activity AS missing_activity
    FROM expected_activities ea
    LEFT JOIN actual_activities a ON ea.activity = a.activity
    WHERE a.activity IS NULL
    GROUP BY e.case_id, ea.activity;
    ```

#### 3. Unusual Roles or Resources for Activities
- **Example:** In `case_id 1004`, the `Receive Payment` activity (event_id 22) and `Issue Invoice` activity (event_id 23) are performed by `FinanceTeam_02` and `FinanceTeam_01` respectively, but there is no `Perform Credit Check` activity.
  - **Hypothesis:** This could indicate a policy violation or a missing step in the process.
  - **Investigation Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, r.resource_id, r.role, r.department
    FROM order_event_log oel
    JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
    WHERE oel.activity NOT IN (
        SELECT activity
        FROM order_event_log
        WHERE case_id = oel.case_id
        GROUP BY activity
        HAVING COUNT(activity) = 1
    )
    ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.activity;
    ```

#### 4. Abnormal Time Gaps Between Activities
- **Example:** In `case_id 1004`, there is a significant time gap between the `Receive Payment` (event_id 22) and `Issue Invoice` (event_id 23) activities.
  - **Hypothesis:** This could be due to delays in the system, manual intervention, or rework.
  - **Investigation Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT e1.case_id, e1.activity AS previous_activity, e1.timestamp AS previous_timestamp,
           e2.activity AS next_activity, e2.timestamp AS next_timestamp,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_between
    FROM order_event_log e1
    JOIN order_event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.event_id + 1 = e2.event_id
    WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) / 3600 > 1
    ORDER BY e1.case_id, e1.event_id;
    ```

#### 5. Activities by the Same Resource in Different Roles
- **Example:** In `case_id 1001`, `FinanceTeam_01` is involved in both `Issue Invoice` and `CreditOfficer_1` in `Perform Credit Check`.
  - **Hypothesis:** This could indicate a role conflict or a resource performing multiple roles.
  - **Investigation Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT oel.case_id, oel.resource, r.role, COUNT(DISTINCT oel.activity) AS num_activities
    FROM order_event_log oel
    JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
    GROUP BY oel.case_id, oel.resource, r.role
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT oel.activity) > 1
    ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.resource;
    ```

### Conclusion
These queries can help identify potential issues in the order process by detecting anomalies and undesirable behaviors. Further investigation and analysis might be needed to understand the root causes and implement corrective actions.
