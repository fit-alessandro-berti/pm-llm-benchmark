Here’s a structured, BPMN-like textual process model based on the interview transcripts. The model captures the standard flow, decision points, roles, and exceptions mentioned by stakeholders.

### **Invoice Approval Process Model (BPMN-like Textual Representation)**

#### **Activities/Tasks:**
1. **Invoice Receipt**
   - *Actor:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   - Trigger: Invoice received (usually via email).

2. **Check for Valid PO Number**
   - If no PO: Send back to supplier for corrections.
   - If PO exists: Log invoice into the accounting system.

3. **Forward to Purchasing for Verification**
   - *Actor:* Accounts Payable Clerk  Purchasing Officer (Dan)
   - Purchasing checks if invoice matches PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges).

4. **Resolve Discrepancies (if any)**
   - If discrepancy found:
     - Contact supplier (via Karen if needed) or request corrected invoice.
     - If unresolved, escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).

5. **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**
   - *Actor:* Purchasing Officer  Accounts Payable Clerk
   - If confirmed, proceed; else, hold invoice.

6. **Manager Approval**
   - *Actor:* Department Manager (Carlos)
   - Trigger: Invoice matches PO, and Purchasing confirms receipt.
   - Possible actions:
     - Approve  Proceed to payment scheduling.
     - Reject  Send back for investigation (loops to discrepancy resolution).

7. **Schedule Payment**
   - *Actor:* Accounts Payable Clerk
   - Invoice added to payment run.

#### **Sequence Flow:**
1. Start: Invoice arrives.
2. Check for PO  If missing, return to supplier.
3. If PO exists  Log invoice  Send to Purchasing.
4. Purchasing verifies invoice against PO.
   - If discrepancy: Resolve (contact supplier/Karen/Rita).
   - If resolved  Proceed to manager approval.
   - If unresolved  Escalate to Rita (may create retrospective PO or reject).
5. Manager approves  Schedule payment.
   - If rejected  Return to discrepancy resolution.

---

#### **Gateways/Decision Points:**
1. **PO Validation Check**
   - Condition: Does invoice have a valid PO?
   - Branches:
     - No PO  Return to supplier.
     - Valid PO  Proceed to logging.

2. **Discrepancy Check (Purchasing)**
   - Condition: Does invoice match PO?
   - Branches:
     - Yes  Proceed to manager approval.
     - No  Resolve discrepancy (loop until resolved).

3. **Manager Approval Decision**
   - Condition: Does manager approve?
   - Branches:
     - Approve  Schedule payment.
     - Reject  Return to discrepancy resolution.

---

#### **Roles/Participants:**
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**
   - Logs invoices, checks POs, routes to Purchasing, schedules payments.
2. **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
   - Validates invoice against PO, confirms receipt of goods.
3. **Department Manager (Carlos)**
   - Final approval/rejection of invoices.
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
   - Handles exceptions (missing POs, unresolved discrepancies).
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**
   - Assists in resolving supplier-related issues (e.g., missing POs, pricing errors).

---

#### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- **Inputs:**
  - Invoice (email attachment or digital upload).
  - Purchase Order (PO) from system.
  - Goods/services receipt confirmation (from Purchasing).
- **Outputs:**
  - Approved invoice (scheduled for payment).
  - Rejected invoice (returned to supplier or held for corrections).
  - Corrected invoice (if discrepancies resolved).

---

#### **Exceptions/Variations:**
1. **Missing PO:**
   - Rita may create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice.
2. **Discrepancies:**
   - Loop until resolved (may involve supplier, Karen, or Rita).
3. **Manager Rejection:**
   - Invoice returns to discrepancy resolution (rare, per Carlos).

---

#### **Ambiguities/Notes:**
1. **Role of Karen:**
   - Not always directly in the workflow; acts as a support role for supplier-related issues.
2. **Retrospective POs:**
   - Only mentioned by Rita for informal contracts (edge case).
3. **System Automation:**
   - Implied (e.g., automatic email to manager), but exact system workflows are unclear.

This model can be directly translated into a BPMN diagram with pools/swimlanes for each role, gateways for decision points, and annotations for exceptions.
