Here's a solution to the prompt that addresses the requirement of filtering out cases with more than six events:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING event_count <= 6
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_event_counts cec 
    ON el.case_id = cec.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

Let me break down the query:

1. The Common Table Expression (CTE) `case_event_counts`:
   - Groups events by `case_id`
   - Counts the number of events for each case
   - Uses `HAVING` to filter only cases with 6 or fewer events

2. The main query:
   - Joins the original `event_log` with the filtered case counts
   - Returns all events for cases that meet the criteria
   - Orders the results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity

This approach ensures that:
- Only cases with 6 or fewer events are included
- All events for the qualifying cases are returned
- The original event log structure is maintained

The query is efficient as it first filters cases at the group level before joining back to the full event log.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the solution?
