The visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram outlining the process of dispatching goods from a Computer Hardware Shop. The diagram is divided into three swimlanes representing different roles or departments: "Secretary", "Logistics", and "Warehouse".

Here's a breakdown of the process flow:

1.  **Start:** The process begins with "Ship goods."
2.  **Secretary Lane:**
    *   "Clarify shipment method" is the first task.
    *   A gateway checks for "Special handling?".
        *   If "yes," the process branches to the "Logistics" lane (described below).
        *   If "no", The process continues to the warehouse lane.
3.  **Logistics Lane:**
    *   If special handling is needed, or the insurance is required, process follows a process with "Insure parcel" which then leads to "Write package label".
    *   "Check if insurance is required" and  "Insure parcel"
    *   A parallel gateway, "Write package label", which is then followed by other actions.
    *   "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" and then "Select logistic company and place order."
4.  **Warehouse Lane:**
    *   "Package goods" is the starting action, and then a timer is present with "48 hours".
    *   "Notify customer about delay".
    *   A parallel gateway follows.
    *   "Fill out Shipment paperwork", which is performed after going through the logistics steps, and is then followed by, "Move package to pickup area."
5.  **End:** The process concludes with the task, "Shipment prepared."

The diagram uses standard BPMN symbols such as:

*   **Start Event:** A circle to indicate the beginning of the process.
*   **Tasks:** Rectangles with rounded corners, representing actions to be performed.
*   **Gateways:** Diamond shapes, representing decision points or branching in the process.
*   **Parallel Gateway:** The diagram uses both exclusive gateways (X-shaped) and parallel gateways (+ shaped).
*   **Data Objects:** a document icon used for "Order details" and the database icon for the customer information.
*   **Timer Event:** A clock symbol is present to indicate a time-related constraint or delay.
*   **End Event:** A circle with a bold outline indicates the end of the process.
*   **Swimlanes:** Horizontal bands to organize tasks by department or role.

The diagram effectively illustrates the steps involved in preparing and dispatching goods, including insurance considerations, special handling, and the role of the secretary, logistics, and warehouse departments.
