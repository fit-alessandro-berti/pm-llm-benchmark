1. How might geopolitical tensions or trade policy changes among the supplier countries (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the United States) disrupt component availability, and what contingency strategies could mitigate this risk?  

2. In what ways can the R&D team’s early collaboration with procurement and logistics shorten overall time-to-market without inflating costs or compromising quality?  

3. How can the company balance just-in-time practices for high-demand regions with the need for supply-chain resilience in the face of unexpected demand surges or transportation bottlenecks?  

4. What predictive analytics or machine-learning approaches would most effectively improve forecast accuracy across diverse markets and product launch cycles?  

5. Which key performance indicators (KPIs) best capture the trade-offs among lead time, cost, carbon footprint, and service level—and how should they be weighted in executive decision-making?  

6. How could the company redesign packaging or shipment configurations to reduce freight costs and environmental impact while safeguarding product integrity?  

7. In the event of a critical component shortage (e.g., microprocessors), what alternative sourcing or modular design strategies could keep production lines running with minimal redesign?  

8. How can the organization verify and enforce ethical labor and environmental standards across multiple tiers of suppliers, especially when visibility beyond first-tier vendors is limited?  

9. What opportunities exist for near-shoring or regional manufacturing that might reduce dependency on a single Malaysian assembly hub without eroding cost advantages?  

10. How might the adoption of advanced automation or collaborative robots in the Malaysian plant affect workforce skills requirements, labor relations, and overall productivity?  

11. What governance framework should oversee data sharing among suppliers, logistics partners, and internal teams to ensure cybersecurity, intellectual-property protection, and regulatory compliance?  

12. How can digital twins or real-time supply-chain visibility platforms uncover hidden bottlenecks and support rapid scenario planning during product launches or recalls?  

13. In multi-currency operations, what treasury or hedging strategies can limit the financial impact of exchange-rate fluctuations on component costs and selling prices?  

14. How could the company leverage circular-economy principles—such as refurbishing returned smartphones or recycling rare-earth elements—to create new revenue streams and meet ESG goals?  

15. What criteria should trigger a shift from air to ocean freight (or vice versa) when balancing urgency, cost, carbon emissions, and capacity constraints?  

16. How can collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR) with major retailers and e-commerce platforms reduce bullwhip effects and inventory write-downs?  

17. What early-warning indicators (e.g., supplier quality drift, geopolitical alerts, logistics delays) should feed into a risk dashboard to enable proactive intervention?  

18. How might stricter data-privacy laws or digital-trade regulations in key markets alter the design of the company’s cloud-based supply-chain systems?  

19. What lessons from past product recalls or warranty claims could inform a more robust reverse-logistics network that minimizes customer inconvenience and cost?  

20. How should the company structure cross-functional teams and incentive systems so that R&D, procurement, manufacturing, and logistics collectively optimize total landed cost rather than siloed departmental goals?
