To address the prompt, we need to construct a DuckDB SQL query that identifies specific `case_id`s based on a two-part condition (activity sequence and time elapsed) and then excludes all events belonging to these identified cases from the final result.

We will use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clarity and to break down the problem into logical steps:

1.  **`CaseSequences`**: This CTE will add window functions (`LAG`) to the `event_log` to identify the activity and timestamp of the immediately preceding and second-preceding events within each `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`. This is crucial for detecting "direct succession."
2.  **`CasesMeetingSequenceCondition`**: This CTE filters the results from `CaseSequences` to find only those rows where the current activity is 'Confirm Order', the immediately preceding activity was 'Create Order', and the activity before that was 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. This identifies all instances of the specific three-activity sequence in direct succession. It also captures the `timestamp` for 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' within that sequence.
3.  **`CasesToExclude`**: This CTE takes the `case_id`s from `CasesMeetingSequenceCondition` and applies the time condition: the difference between the 'Confirm Order' timestamp and the 'Create Order' timestamp must be `> 5 days`. We use `DISTINCT case_id` here because if a case has *any* sequence instance that meets the time condition, the entire case should be excluded.
4.  **Final Query**: The main `SELECT` statement then retrieves all columns (`*`) from the original `event_log` where the `case_id` is NOT found in the `CasesToExclude` CTE.

```sql
WITH CaseSequences AS (
    -- Step 1: Augment event_log with preceding activities and their timestamps
    -- This allows us to check for the direct succession of activities
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity_1,
        LAG(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity_2,
        LAG(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp_1
    FROM
        event_log
),
CasesMeetingSequenceCondition AS (
    -- Step 2: Identify all instances of the specific three-activity sequence in direct succession
    -- and capture the relevant timestamps for time difference calculation
    SELECT
        case_id,
        timestamp AS confirm_order_timestamp,
        prev_timestamp_1 AS create_order_timestamp
    FROM
        CaseSequences
    WHERE
        activity = 'Confirm Order' AND
        prev_activity_1 = 'Create Order' AND
        prev_activity_2 = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
),
CasesToExclude AS (
    -- Step 3: From the cases with the sequence, select only those where
    -- the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
    -- Use DISTINCT to get a unique list of case_ids to be excluded.
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM
        CasesMeetingSequenceCondition
    WHERE
        confirm_order_timestamp - create_order_timestamp > INTERVAL '5' DAY
)
-- Step 4: Return all events from event_log except those whose case_id is in CasesToExclude
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log AS el
WHERE
    el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesToExclude);

```
