### Discovered Process Behavior from the Event Log

From the 5 cases, the process shows the following patterns:

1. **Fixed sequence at the start**: Every case starts with **OR → MS → QS → AS**.

2. **Optional in-line quality loop** after the initial AS:
   - Sometimes there is no IQC (case 4).
   - Sometimes IQC occurs 1–2 times (cases 1,2,3,5), each time followed by another AS.
   - This is a repeatable block: (IQC → AS)* (zero or more times) after the first AS.

3. **Testing with possible rework**:
   - After the (possibly repeated) assembly phase, always **TST**.
   - Sometimes TST is immediately followed by PK (no failure: cases 2,4).
   - Sometimes TST → RT → TST occurs one or more times (cases 1,3,5 show 1–2 failures).
   - This is a loop: do TST, then either exit or do RT and repeat TST.

4. **Optional labeling**:
   - After PK, either **LB** (cases 1,3,4,5) or skip directly to DP (case 2).
   - This is an exclusive choice between LB and a silent skip.

5. **Fixed ending**: Always **DP → D** after the packaging/labeling phase.

All steps are strictly sequential (no concurrency observed between different activities).

### POWL Model

The model uses:
- Transitions for labeled activities.
- SilentTransition (tau) for the skip of labeling.
- LOOP operator for the two loops (in-line quality and testing rework).
- XOR operator for the optional labeling.
- A top-level StrictPartialOrder to enforce the overall sequence.

```
A = Transition("OR")
B = Transition("MS")
C = Transition("QS")
D = Transition("AS")
E = Transition("IQC")
F = Transition("TST")
G = Transition("RT")
H = Transition("PK")
I = Transition("LB")
J = Transition("DP")
K = Transition("D")

tau = SilentTransition()                          # skip for labeling

# Loop for in-line quality check: zero or more times (IQC → AS)
iqc_loop_body = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[E, D])
iqc_loop_body.order.add_edge(E, D)
iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[iqc_loop_body, tau])  # second child is exit

# Loop for testing rework: do TST, then either exit or (RT → TST) and repeat
rework_body = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[G, F])
rework_body.order.add_edge(G, F)
test_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[F, rework_body])     # first child = do (TST), second = redo (RT → TST)

# Optional labeling: choice between LB and skip
label_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[I, tau])

# Top-level strict partial order enforcing the overall sequence
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    A,          # OR
    B,          # MS
    C,          # QS
    D,          # initial AS
    iqc_loop,   # optional (IQC → AS)*
    test_loop,  # TST with possible rework
    H,          # PK
    label_choice, # LB or skip
    J,          # DP
    K           # D
])

# Add ordering edges
root.order.add_edge(A, B)
root.order.add_edge(B, C)
root.order.add_edge(C, D)
root.order.add_edge(D, iqc_loop)
root.order.add_edge(iqc_loop, test_loop)
root.order.add_edge(test_loop, H)
root.order.add_edge(H, label_choice)
root.order.add_edge(label_choice, J)
root.order.add_edge(J, K)
```

### Textual Representation (for readability)

```
PO = (
    nodes = {
        OR,
        MS,
        QS,
        AS,
        * ( PO(IQC → AS), τ ),               // optional in-line quality loop (0 or more)
        * ( TST, PO(RT → TST) ),             // testing with possible rework (1 or more TST)
        PK,
        X ( LB, τ ),                         // optional labeling
        DP,
        D
    },
    order = {
        OR → MS,
        MS → QS,
        QS → AS,
        AS → * ( PO(IQC → AS), τ ),
        * ( PO(IQC → AS), τ ) → * ( TST, PO(RT → TST) ),
        * ( TST, PO(RT → TST) ) → PK,
        PK → X ( LB, τ ),
        X ( LB, τ ) → DP,
        DP → D
    }
)
```

This POWL model precisely captures all observed traces:
- The in-line quality loop can execute 0 times (case 4) or multiple times (other cases).
- The testing loop executes at least once and repeats on failure.
- Labeling can be skipped (case 2).
- All mandatory activities and their ordering constraints are enforced.
