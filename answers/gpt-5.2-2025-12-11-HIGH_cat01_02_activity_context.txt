### Brief justification of the renaming (what changed and why)

- **“Verify Documents” (recurs in C001, C003)**  
  - Renamed to **Initial** vs **Re-Verification** based on *position in the case* (first check vs second check) and *trigger* (second occurs after “Submit Additional” in C001 and after “Adjust Account” in C003).  
  - In C003, also labeled **“In-Person”** because the *resource/context* indicates physical verification at a branch (BranchOfficer, walk-in).

- **“Call Customer” (recurs in C002; also semantically different in C001/C003)**  
  - Renamed by *call purpose* taken directly from the context text:  
    - C001: **request missing documents**  
    - C002 first: **clarify discrepancy**; C002 second: **confirm adjustment**  
    - C003: **ask customer to return to branch**  
  This disambiguates multiple “Call Customer” events into distinct support actions.

- **“Initiate Request” (not recurring within a case, but contextually different across cases)**  
  - Split into **Web Portal submission** vs **Branch walk-in logging** using the *resource* (WebPortal vs BranchReception) and the *context description*.

- **“Adjust Account” (not recurring within a case, but different reasons across cases)**  
  - Renamed to reflect *why* the adjustment happens: post-discrepancy call (C002) vs missing info correction (C003).

If you want, I can also provide a compact “mapping table” from original  renamed labels for reuse in preprocessing.
