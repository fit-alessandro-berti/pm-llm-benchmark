The picture is a Business Process Model & Notation (BPMN-2.0) diagram that describes how a company handles a customer order from the moment the order is received until the product is shipped.  
The model is organised in four horizontal “swim-lanes”, one for each department involved, so you can immediately see who is responsible for which activity.


1.  SALES lane (top)
   • Start event “Monday morning” – the weekly order-processing cycle begins.  
   • “Check order for completeness.”  
   • “Check if customer is already in the database.” (exclusive gateway)  
        – If the customer is not found, the task “Add customer to the database” is executed and the flow rejoins the main line.  
   • Message task “Send order details.”  
        – A dashed message flow (envelopes on the connectors) delivers the order details to Production and Procurement.  
   • “Draft invoice.” (the sales process ends here, waiting for the product to be shipped in order to send the final invoice).


2.  PRODUCTION lane
   • Message start event “Order details arrive.”  
   • “Plan production.”  
   • Exclusive gateway checks whether the required material is already available.  
        – If extra material is needed, a message is sent to the Procurement lane (dashed flow).  
   • Intermediate message catch event “Material not faulty” waits for Procurement’s confirmation.  
   • “Manufacture product.”  
   • End event “Product complete.”  
        – A message announcing completion is sent to the Warehouse lane (and as a dotted line back to Sales so the invoice can be finalised).


3.  PROCUREMENT lane
   • Message start event “Order details arrive.”  
   • Expanded subprocess “Material Compensation”  
        – Task “Order materials.”  
        – If something is wrong with what is delivered an internal dotted flow goes to “Return material.”  
   • “Check materials.”  
   • Intermediate message throw event sends either  
        – “Material not faulty” (back to Production) or  
        – “Order cancellation” (to the end event if materials cannot be obtained).  
   • End event (normal or cancelling).


4.  WAREHOUSE lane (bottom)
   • Message start event receives “Product complete.”  
   • “Send product.”  
   • End event “Product sent” – a confirming message goes back (dotted line) to the Sales lane so the order can be closed and the invoice issued.


Key notational elements you can see
• Rounded circles = start / intermediate / end events.  
• Envelope icons on events/tasks = message throw/catch (communication between lanes).  
• Diamonds = gateways (decision points).  
• Rectangles with a “+” = expanded subprocesses.  
• Solid arrows = sequence flow inside one lane; dashed arrows = message flow crossing lanes.

Overall narrative
1. Sales validates the order and the customer.  
2. Production plans the job and, if necessary, asks Procurement to buy or replace materials.  
3. Procurement orders, checks and, where necessary, returns materials, signalling Production when acceptable material is on hand (or cancels if not).  
4. Production manufactures the product and notifies Warehouse and Sales once it is finished.  
5. Warehouse ships the product and confirms shipment, enabling Sales to finalise the invoice.

The diagram therefore gives a complete, department-by-department view of how an order is processed, manufactured, supplied and shipped, as well as how exceptions (missing or faulty material) are handled.
