1. Total resolution time per ticket  
(calculated from “Receive Ticket” to “Close Ticket”)

• Case 101 2 h 15 m  
• Case 102  25 h 10 m  
• Case 103 1 h 20 m  
• Case 104  24 h 10 m  
• Case 105  49 h 5 m  

Clearly, tickets 102, 104 and 105 are the outliers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Root-cause analysis of the slow cases  
(looking at long gaps between successive events)

Case 102  
- 09:00 – 11:302.5 h lag between “Assign L-1” and the escalation.  
- 14:00 – next day 09:0016 h wait to start Level-2 investigation.

Case 104  
- 09:30 – 13:003.5 h gap between “Assign L-1” and “Investigate”.  
- 13:00 – next day 08:0017 h wait between investigation and resolution.

Case 105  
- 09:10 – 10:00“Investigate Issue” starts quickly, but more than 18 h later the ticket is still escalated (14:00 the next day).  
- After escalation, another 19 h pass before Level-2 begins to investigate.  
- Total Level-2 turnaround time is thus ~28 h.

Patterns identified  
a) Escalation almost always precedes a large delay; once Level-2 is involved the clock slows drastically.  
b) The hand-offs between support levels (and possibly between shifts / regions) introduce long idle times.  
c) No long delays are observed within Level-1 activity chains; delays only appear when the ticket crosses organisational boundaries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How the factors prolong cycle time  
• Queues rather than effort  15–20 hour “dead time” blocks explain almost the entire additional duration.  
• Late-in-cycle escalations leave tickets waiting overnight when Level-2 is off-shift.  
• No evidence of follow-up triggers (SLA alerts, re-assignment) during these idle hours.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Insights & Recommendations

1. Separate queue lengths for Level-1 and Level-2 should be monitored hourly; introduce capacity triggers (e.g., >4 h waiting = escalation approved).  
2. Introduce 24 / 7 Level-2 coverage on a rotation/rota basis until the Level-2 backlog falls below a threshold.  
3. Add an SLA clock that starts ticking either at escalation or at any idle period >2 h so that tickets are re-assigned or handed off quickly.  
4. Investigate the triage quality—Are tickets (esp. 104, 105) that are later escalated being misjudged at triage? Earlier specialist involvement (Level-2 triage desk) could bypass the Level-1 delay for category-rocket issues.  
5. Automate a “nudge” rule: if no activity for x hours, auto-re-assign or page current owner.

Implementing the two main fixes—shorter queues to Level-2 and enforcing strict hand-off SLAs—should cut the average resolution time of escalated tickets from >24 h to <6-8 h, bringing the slow outliers much closer to the baseline of 2 h.
