To clarify the activities within the event log and reflect their contextual differences, we'll rename the activities that appear multiple times within the same case. The goal is to ensure that the new names disambiguate the activities and highlight their roles in the process flow.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Recurring Activities:**
   - The activities "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer" appear multiple times within the same case.

2. **Interpret Contextual Meanings:**
   - **Verify Documents:**
     - First occurrence: Initial document verification.
     - Second occurrence: Re-verification after additional documents are submitted or after adjustments.
   - **Call Customer:**
     - First occurrence: Initial contact for missing documents or clarifications.
     - Second occurrence: Follow-up call to confirm or discuss adjustments.

3. **Renaming Activities:**
   - **Verify Documents:**
     - First occurrence: "Initial Document Verification"
     - Second occurrence: "Re-verify Documents"
   - **Call Customer:**
     - First occurrence: "Initial Customer Call"
     - Second occurrence: "Follow-up Customer Call"

4. **Revised Event Log:**

### Justification for Naming Choices:

- **Initial Document Verification:**
  - The first occurrence of "Verify Documents" is renamed to "Initial Document Verification" because it represents the initial step of checking the documents when the request is first processed.

- **Re-verify Documents:**
  - The second occurrence of "Verify Documents" is renamed to "Re-verify Documents" because it involves rechecking the documents after additional information or adjustments have been made.

- **Initial Customer Call:**
  - The first occurrence of "Call Customer" is renamed to "Initial Customer Call" because it is the initial contact made with the customer to clarify or request additional information.

- **Follow-up Customer Call:**
  - The second occurrence of "Call Customer" is renamed to "Follow-up Customer Call" because it is a subsequent call made to confirm adjustments or discuss further details after the initial call.

These renaming choices ensure that the activities are clearly differentiated based on their context and position in the process flow.
