Based on the event attributes and their logical order, we can group these events into separate cases. Here's the inferred grouping:

**Case 1: Patient with patient_age=45, patient_gender=M**

* Event 1: Register patient (2024-03-15T08:05:13Z)
* Event 4: Initial triage (2024-03-15T08:10:50Z)
* Event 7: X-ray imaging (2024-03-15T08:15:42Z)
* Event 12: Doctor consultation (2024-03-15T08:23:10Z)
* Event 15: Patient discharged (2024-03-15T08:30:05Z)

**Case 2: Patient with patient_age=62, patient_gender=F**

* Event 2: Register patient (2024-03-15T08:07:02Z)
* Event 5: Initial triage (2024-03-15T08:12:29Z)
* Event 8: Lab test requested (2024-03-15T08:16:10Z)
* Event 10: Lab test completed (2024-03-15T08:20:27Z)
* Event 11: Doctor consultation (2024-03-15T08:22:54Z)
* Event 14: Prescription created (2024-03-15T08:27:00Z)
* Event 17: Patient discharged (2024-03-15T08:35:29Z)

**Case 3: Patient with patient_age=28, patient_gender=M**

* Event 3: Register patient (2024-03-15T08:07:15Z)
* Event 6: Doctor consultation (2024-03-15T08:13:00Z)
* Event 9: Surgery preparation (2024-03-15T08:16:45Z)
* Event 13: Surgery performed (2024-03-15T08:25:19Z)
* Event 16: Recovery room (2024-03-15T08:31:37Z)
* Event 18: Patient discharged (2024-03-15T08:40:13Z)

The grouping is based on the following logic:

* Each case starts with a "Register patient" event.
* Events with the same patient_age and patient_gender are grouped together.
* The department and activity attributes help to further verify the grouping.
* The timestamp attribute ensures that the events within a case are in a logical order.

By applying this logic, we can infer the case IDs and group the events accordingly.
