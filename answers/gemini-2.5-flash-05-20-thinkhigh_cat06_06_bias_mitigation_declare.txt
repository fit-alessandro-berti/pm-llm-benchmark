To mitigate bias in the loan application process, we will introduce several new activities and DECLARE constraints. The new activities will include steps for checking sensitive attributes, performing bias mitigation, and conducting manual reviews, as well as explicit approval and rejection decisions.

Here's the updated DECLARE model with added constraints and a rationale for each:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # --- NEW CONSTRAINTS FOR BIAS MITIGATION ---
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # --- NEW CONSTRAINTS FOR BIAS MITIGATION ---
        # If sensitive attributes are checked, a bias mitigation check must follow.
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # --- NEW CONSTRAINTS FOR BIAS MITIGATION ---
        # Bias mitigation check must occur before any final decision (Approve or Reject).
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        # Manual review must occur before any rejection decision.
        "ManualReview": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        # --- NEW CONSTRAINTS FOR BIAS MITIGATION ---
        # Sensitive attribute checks cannot be immediately followed by a rejection.
        "CheckSensitiveAttributes": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints:

1.  **`existence` constraints for `Approve`, `Reject`, `CheckSensitiveAttributes`, `ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
    *   **Rationale:** These activities are fundamental additions to the process, ensuring that explicit approval/rejection paths exist, sensitive data is explicitly considered, and dedicated bias mitigation and manual review steps are part of the overall process. Their existence in the model signifies their intended role.

2.  **`response` constraint: `CheckSensitiveAttributes` -> `BiasMitigationCheck`**
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint mandates that whenever sensitive applicant attributes (e.g., race, gender, age) are reviewed (`CheckSensitiveAttributes`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity must eventually follow within the same process instance. This ensures that the process explicitly accounts for and attempts to correct potential biases immediately after sensitive data is accessed.

3.  **`precedence` constraints: `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede `Approve` and `Reject`**
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints enforce that the `BiasMitigationCheck` activity *must* be completed before any final decision (`Approve` or `Reject`) can be made. This prevents a final decision from being reached without the necessary bias review having taken place, thereby embedding fairness into the decision-making sequence.

4.  **`precedence` constraint: `ManualReview` must precede `Reject`**
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint ensures that a `ManualReview` activity *must* occur before any `Reject` decision is made. This provides a critical human oversight step, especially for rejections which are more prone to discriminatory outcomes, allowing for a thorough review of the application before a negative decision is finalized.

5.  **`nonsuccession` constraint: `CheckSensitiveAttributes` cannot immediately precede `Reject`**
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint prevents a direct and immediate rejection (`Reject`) right after `CheckSensitiveAttributes`. It disallows a "shortcut" from sensitive attribute discovery to a negative outcome, forcing the process to include intermediate steps like `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview` to break any potentially biased direct sequence and ensure a fairer evaluation.

These added constraints collectively reinforce a process design that is more robust against algorithmic and human biases, promoting fair and consistent outcomes for all loan applicants.
