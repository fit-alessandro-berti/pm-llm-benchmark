### Explanation of the Transformation Logic

1. **Case Identification**  
   - A single logical work session was inferred for each user interaction that revolves around a **single document**: `Document1.docx` (draft), and then later revisiting it (`Quarterly_Report.docx`). The sessions were grouped together because they share the same source, destination, and activities across the entire day without clear separation into distinct cases.

2. **Activity Naming**  
   - Raw actions such as “FOCUS,” “TYPING,” “SAVE,” etc., have been translated to meaningful process steps:
     - *Focus* on an application/document (e.g., `Focus on Document1.docx`).
     - Typing or entering text in a document (`Typing Draft intro`, `Typing Additional details`, etc.).
     - Saving changes (`Save Document1.docx`, `Save Budget_2024.xlsx`).
     - Switching between applications (e.g., *Switch to Email – Inbox*).
     - Navigating actions inside an email or PDF (e.g., *Click Open Email*, *Scroll Down*, *Highlight Key Findings*, etc.).

3. **Event Attributes**  
   - **Case ID**: All events belong to a single case (`1`), representing the overall editing and reporting work session for `Document1.docx`.
   - **Activity Name**: Descriptive activity names that capture the intent of each raw event.
   - **Timestamp**: The original timestamp from the log is preserved.

4. **Narrative Coherence**  
   - The resulting table tells a clear story: A user edits an initial draft, sends/receives related communications, reviews/annotates another document (the report draft), updates the budget spreadsheet, and finally revisits the first document to finalize it before closing all applications. Each step logically follows from the previous one within the same case.

5. **Consistency Across Tools**  
   - The transformed log is structured in a way that standard processmining tools (e.g., Disco, ProM) can ingest and analyze without modification. It includes only necessary attributes: Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp, ensuring compatibility with any tool used for mining, visualizing, or analyzing the workflow.

This transformation ensures that the raw Windows activity log is now a structured event log ready for processmining analysis while preserving all relevant business logic and user intent.
