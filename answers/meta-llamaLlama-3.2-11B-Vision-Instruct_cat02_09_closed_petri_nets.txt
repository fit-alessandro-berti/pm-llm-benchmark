Here are the opposite concepts, and more general concepts for each of the given Petri nets concepts:

1. **Source Place** (opposite: Sink Place, more general: Place)
   - **Source Place**: A place with only one outgoing arc.
   - **Sink Place**: A place with only one incoming arc (opposite of source place).
   - **Place**: A location in a Petri net that contains tokens, representing a resource or a condition.

2. **Immediate Transition** (opposite: Delayed Transition, more general: Transition)
   - **Immediate Transition**: A transition that can fire as soon as all its input arcs are marked with a token.
   - **Delayed Transition**: A transition that cannot fire until a certain condition is met (opposite of immediate transition).
   - **Transition**: An event in a Petri net that changes the marking of places by consuming tokens from input places and producing tokens in output places.

3. **Live Transition** (opposite: Dead Transition, more general: Transition)
   - **Live Transition**: A transition that can fire infinitely many times in a Petri net.
   - **Dead Transition**: A transition that can never fire in a Petri net (opposite of live transition).
   - **Transition**: An event in a Petri net that changes the marking of places by consuming tokens from input places and producing tokens in output places.

4. **Bounded Net** (opposite: Unbounded Net, more general: Net)
   - **Bounded Net**: A Petri net where each place is bounded, meaning that the number of tokens it can hold is finite.
   - **Unbounded Net**: A Petri net where at least one place is unbounded, meaning that it can hold an infinite number of tokens (opposite of bounded net).
   - **Net**: A Petri net, which is a directed bipartite graph with two types of nodes: places and transitions.

5. **Free Choice Net** (opposite: Strictly Conflicting Net, more general: Net)
   - **Free Choice Net**: A Petri net where for any two transitions, if one transition can fire, then the other can also fire without any restriction.
   - **Strictly Conflicting Net**: A Petri net where for any two transitions, if one transition can fire, then the other cannot fire (opposite of free choice net).
   - **Net**: A Petri net, which is a directed bipartite graph with
