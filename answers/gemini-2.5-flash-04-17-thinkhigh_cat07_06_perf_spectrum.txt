The visualization displays a series of events across time, structured into three distinct horizontal bands. Each band represents a specific event: "Send Fine" at the top, "Insert Fine Notification" in the middle, and "Send for Credit Collection" at the bottom. Vertical lines connect events occurring within a single process, illustrating the sequence and duration of these events. The horizontal axis represents time, spanning from January 25, 2000, at 1:00:00 on the left to April 24, 2013, at 2:00:00 on the right.

The top band ("Send Fine") shows numerous vertical grey lines concentrated towards the left side of the timeline. These lines extend downwards to the middle band ("Insert Fine Notification"). This suggests that "Send Fine" events occurred frequently in the earlier part of the observed period and were consistently followed by "Insert Fine Notification" events.

The middle band ("Insert Fine Notification") also displays vertical lines, which then extend downwards to the bottom band ("Send for Credit Collection"). These lines are a mix of grey and a reddish-pink color. The reddish-pink lines appear to be a subset of the grey lines originating from the top band. Notably, there are fewer lines reaching the bottom band than originating from the top band, indicating that not all processes initiated with "Send Fine" events progressed to "Send for Credit Collection".

The bottom band ("Send for Credit Collection") has fewer vertical lines, predominantly reddish-pink, suggesting that this event occurred less frequently than the other two. The lines connecting to this band originate from the "Insert Fine Notification" band and also terminate on the bottom band at various points in time.

Overall, the visualization effectively illustrates the flow of processes through three stages over a thirteen-year period. The density and color of the lines provide insights into the frequency of each event and the progression of processes through the defined sequence. The timeline at the bottom allows for understanding the temporal distribution of these events.
