So I'm diving into Petri nets here, which are these graphical models used to describe concurrent systems. They consist of places and transitions connected by arcs, and they're really useful for modeling all sorts of processes where events happen in parallel but also need to synchronize or share resources.

First up, I have to propose opposite concepts and more general concepts for a list of terms related to Petri nets. The terms are: Source Place, Immediate Transition, Live Transition, Bounded Net, and Free Choice Net. Okay, let's tackle each one step by step.

Starting with **Source Place**. In Petri nets, a place is a node that can hold tokens, which represent resources or conditions. A source place is typically a place that has no incoming arcs, meaning it's initialized with some tokens at the start and doesn't receive tokens from other parts of the net. So, the opposite of a source place would be a place that has only incoming arcs and no outgoing arcs, which I guess would be similar to a sink place. A sink place is where tokens go to disappear or be consumed. So, opposite to a source place is a sink place.

Now, for a more general concept related to places, maybe just "place" itself, since places can have any number of incoming and outgoing arcs, not just zero incoming arcs like source places.

Next is **Immediate Transition**. In Petri nets, transitions represent events that can occur, and they require all their input places to have tokens before they can fire. An immediate transition is one that doesn't have any input places, meaning it can fire at any time without any conditions. So, the opposite would be a transition that has many input places, maybe even dependent on multiple conditions to fire. Maybe something like a "conditional transition" where it requires tokens from multiple places before it can fire.

A more general concept here could be just "transition," which can have any number of input and output places, not necessarily zero inputs like immediate transitions.

Moving on to **Live Transition**. A live transition in a Petri net is one that can potentially fire, given some marking of the net. In other words, there's at least one possible state where the transition is enabled. The opposite of that would be a "dead transition," which can never fire under any circumstances, no matter how the tokens are distributed in the net.

A more general concept related to transition behavior could be "enabled transition," which is a transition that is currently ready to fire based on the current marking, as opposed to just being live, which means it could potentially be enabled sometime in the future.

Now, **Bounded Net**. A bounded net is one where the number of tokens in any place never exceeds a certain fixed number. This is important because unbounded nets can have places with an arbitrarily large number of tokens, which can make analysis more complex. The opposite of a bounded net would be an "unbounded net," where at least one place can have an arbitrary number of tokens.

A more general concept here might be just "Petri net" without any restrictions on token counts, which could include both bounded and unbounded nets.

Lastly, **Free Choice Net**. This is a specific type of Petri net where places are either input-exclusive or output-exclusive for transitions. In other words, no two different transitions can have common input places, and no two different places can have common input transitions. It's a restriction on the net's structure to make analysis easier.

The opposite of a free choice net would perhaps be a "general net" where places and transitions can have arbitrary connections, meaning places can feed into multiple transitions and transitions can read from multiple places in complex ways.

A more general concept here could be just "workflow net" or "Petri net" without the specific structural restrictions imposed by the free choice property.

So, to summarize:

1. **Source Place**:
   - Opposite: Sink Place
   - General Concept: Place

2. **Immediate Transition**:
   - Opposite: Conditional Transition
   - General Concept: Transition

3. **Live Transition**:
   - Opposite: Dead Transition
   - General Concept: Enabled Transition

4. **Bounded Net**:
   - Opposite: Unbounded Net
   - General Concept: Petri Net

5. **Free Choice Net**:
   - Opposite: General Net
   - General Concept: Petri Net

I think this covers it. Each opposite concept is kind of the reverse of the original in some way, and the general concepts are broader categories that include the original concepts as special cases.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See above explanation for the opposite and general concepts related to the given Petri net terms.}} \]
