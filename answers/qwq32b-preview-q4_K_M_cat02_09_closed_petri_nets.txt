I'm going to tackle this task by first understanding each concept in Petri nets and then proposing both an opposite concept and a more general concept for each one. Let's dive into it step by step.

**1. Source Place**

- **Definition**: A source place in a Petri net is a place that has no input arcs, meaning no transitions can write to it directly. It usually represents the initial marking or the starting point of the net.

- **Opposite Concept**: A "sink place" could be considered the opposite. A sink place has no output arcs, meaning no transitions can read from it once tokens are there. It represents a final state where tokens accumulate and cannot proceed further.

- **More General Concept**: A "place" in general is any node in the Petri net that can hold tokens. This is more general because it includes source places, sink places, and all other places that have both input and output arcs.

**2. Immediate Transition**

- **Definition**: An immediate transition is one that fires as soon as its enabling condition is met, without any delay. It's often used in timed Petri nets to model instantaneous events.

- **Opposite Concept**: A "timed transition" or "delayed transition" would be the opposite. This type of transition doesn't fire immediately when enabled but waits for a specified amount of time before firing.

- **More General Concept**: A "transition" in general is an event that can change the marking of the net by consuming tokens from input places and producing tokens in output places. This is more general as it includes both immediate and timed transitions.

**3. Live Transition**

- **Definition**: A live transition is one that can fire at some point in the future, no matter what the current state of the net is. In other words, there's always a possibility to enable this transition under some sequence of firings.

- **Opposite Concept**: A "dead transition" is one that can never fire because it's impossible to enable it, given the structure and initial marking of the net.

- **More General Concept**: The concept of "transition liveness" in general refers to properties related to whether transitions can fire under certain conditions. This includes live transitions, eventually live transitions, and other variations.

**4. Bounded Net**

- **Definition**: A bounded net is one where the number of tokens in any place never exceeds a certain fixed number, no matter how many times transitions fire. This property is important for preventing unbounded growth in the system.

- **Opposite Concept**: An "unbounded net" is one where the number of tokens in at least one place can grow without any upper limit.

- **More General Concept**: The concept of "place properties" in Petri nets, which includes various attributes like boundedness, liveness, reversibility, etc., provides a broader framework for analyzing net behavior.

**5. Free Choice Net**

- **Definition**: A free choice net is a type of Petri net where each transition is either an X-transition (having only one input place) or an E-transition (having mutually exclusive input places, meaning no two input places share a common predecessor).

- **Opposite Concept**: A "general net" or "asymmetric net" doesn't have the restrictions imposed by free choice nets. Transitions can have multiple input places without the mutual exclusivity condition.

- **More General Concept**: The class of "workflow nets" is more general as it includes various subclasses like free choice nets, state machine nets, marked graph nets, etc., each with different structural properties and behavioral characteristics.

By exploring these concepts and their opposites or generalizations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the flexibility and diversity within the Petri net modeling framework.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See above analysis for opposite and more general concepts related to source place, immediate transition, live transition, bounded net, and free choice net in Petri nets.}} \]
