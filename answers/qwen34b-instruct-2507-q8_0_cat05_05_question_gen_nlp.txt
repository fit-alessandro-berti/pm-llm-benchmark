1. How might geopolitical tensions or trade policy shifts in key regions (e.g., U.S.-China, EU-China) disrupt the global sourcing strategy for smartphone components, and what resilient alternatives could be developed?

2. What are the hidden risks associated with over-reliance on single-source suppliers for critical components like microprocessors or OLED screens, and how can the company diversify without compromising quality or lead time?

3. How can the company balance the need for just-in-time manufacturing with the risks of supply chain fragility, especially during global disruptions like pandemics or natural disasters?

4. In what ways might cultural or labor regulatory differences across countries impact the efficiency and ethics of operations in the assembly plant in Malaysia?

5. How can real-time data from multiple supply chain nodes—production, logistics, sales—be integrated to create a unified, predictive demand forecast that accounts for regional market volatility?

6. What role does digital traceability play in ensuring product compliance with environmental regulations (e.g., RoHS, EPEAT), and how can this be leveraged to build consumer trust?

7. How might the increasing use of AI and machine learning in demand forecasting lead to unintended consequences, such as over-predicting demand in certain regions and resulting in overproduction?

8. What are the environmental and carbon footprint implications of using air freight versus sea freight for regional deliveries, and how can the company transition to a more sustainable logistics model without sacrificing speed?

9. How can the company ensure ethical sourcing and labor practices across its global supplier network—especially in regions with weaker oversight—and what metrics should be used to measure compliance?

10. What would happen if a major supplier in South Korea or Japan were to experience a sudden quality failure in camera modules, and how would that ripple through the entire supply chain?

11. How can the company design a dynamic inventory management system that adapts to both sudden demand spikes and long-term market trends, such as shifts in consumer preferences?

12. In what ways might the use of regional assembly hubs (e.g., in India or Vietnam) reduce transportation costs and improve local responsiveness, and what challenges would arise in managing such a decentralized model?

13. How can the company mitigate the risk of product recalls while maintaining brand reputation, especially when a defect emerges in a product after it has been distributed globally?

14. What are the implications of shifting from monthly aggregated shipments to more frequent, smaller deliveries in high-demand markets, and how would this affect inventory costs, logistics complexity, and carbon emissions?

15. How can the supply chain respond to changing consumer behaviors—like increased demand for refurbished or sustainable electronics—without altering the core production model?

16. What role do local regulations and customs policies play in determining the feasibility of direct-to-consumer (DTC) delivery models, and how can the company navigate these complexities?

17. How might the integration of blockchain technology improve transparency and accountability in the supply chain, particularly in tracking component origins and verifying compliance?

18. What are the long-term strategic trade-offs between maintaining high automation in the Malaysian assembly plant and investing in human-in-the-loop quality assurance systems?

19. How can the company leverage supplier collaboration platforms to foster innovation and co-development of components, rather than treating suppliers as passive vendors?

20. In an era of global uncertainty, how can the supply chain be restructured to serve as a resilient, adaptive ecosystem that can pivot quickly in response to emerging risks—economic, environmental, or technological?
