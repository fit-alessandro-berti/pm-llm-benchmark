Here is a **BPMN-like textual process model** derived from the interview excerpts, capturing the key activities, sequence flow, decision points, roles, and exceptions:

---

### **Invoice Approval Process (BPMN-like Textual Model)**

#### **1. Start Event**
- **Trigger:** Invoice received (typically via email).

#### **2. Activities/Tasks & Sequence Flow**
1. **Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number**
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   - **Action:** Verify if the invoice has a valid PO number.
   - **Outcome:**
     - **If no PO number:** Send invoice back to supplier (via email) requesting details.
     - **If PO number exists:** Proceed to log the invoice in the accounting system.

2. **Log Invoice in Accounting System**
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   - **Action:** Enter invoice details into the system.

3. **Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Confirmation**
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   - **Action:** Send invoice to Purchasing for verification of goods/services receipt.

4. **Purchasing Verification**
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
   - **Action:** Compare invoice line items against the PO.
   - **Outcome:**
     - **If discrepancy (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items):**
       - **Option 1:** Contact supplier directly for correction.
       - **Option 2:** Request Accounts Payable to hold invoice until resolved.
     - **If no discrepancy:** Send confirmation email to Accounts Payable.

5. **Match Invoice to PO**
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   - **Action:** Ensure invoice matches PO details in the system.
   - **Outcome:**
     - **If mismatch:** Email Purchasing for clarification.
     - **If unresolved discrepancy:** Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).

6. **Manager Approval**
   - **Role:** Department Manager (Carlos)
   - **Trigger:** System sends automatic email after Purchasing confirmation.
   - **Action:** Review invoice, PO, and confirmation.
   - **Outcome:**
     - **If approved:** Proceed to payment scheduling.
     - **If rejected/suspicious:** Request Accounts Payable to hold and investigate.

7. **Schedule Payment**
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   - **Action:** Add approved invoice to the next payment cycle.

#### **3. Gateways/Decision Points**
- **Gateway 1 (After PO Check):**
  - **Condition:** Does the invoice have a valid PO number?
    - **Yes:** Proceed to logging.
    - **No:** Send back to supplier.
- **Gateway 2 (After Purchasing Verification):**
  - **Condition:** Does the invoice match the PO?
    - **Yes:** Proceed to manager approval.
    - **No:** Escalate to supervisor or supplier.
- **Gateway 3 (After Manager Review):**
  - **Condition:** Is the invoice approved?
    - **Yes:** Schedule payment.
    - **No:** Hold for investigation.

#### **4. Roles/Participants**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Logs invoices, checks PO, forwards to Purchasing, escalates issues.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Verifies invoice against PO, resolves discrepancies.
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Approves/rejects invoices.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Handles exceptions (missing PO, unresolved discrepancies).
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Assists in resolving supplier-related issues.

#### **5. Artifacts/Inputs & Outputs**
- **Inputs:**
  - Invoice (email or document).
  - Purchase Order (PO) details.
  - Supplier confirmation (if applicable).
- **Outputs:**
  - Logged invoice in accounting system.
  - Approved/rejected invoice status.
  - Payment schedule.

#### **6. Exceptions/Variations**
- **Missing PO Number:** Invoice sent back to supplier.
- **Discrepancy in Invoice vs. PO:**
  - Supplier contacted for correction.
  - Escalated to supervisor if unresolved.
- **Informal Services (No PO):** Supervisor works with department heads to create retrospective PO or reject invoice.
- **Manager Rejection:** Invoice held for further investigation.

#### **7. Notes on Ambiguities/Conflicts**
- **Supplier Contact:** Mary mentions sending back to supplier, while Dan and Karen mention Purchasing or Supplier Relationship Manager may handle this. Clarification needed on who primarily contacts suppliers.
- **Payment Scheduling:** Mary and Dan mention Accounts Payable schedules payment, but Carlos assumes it goes back to AP. No conflict, just confirmation of role.

### **Final Notes**
This model captures the core flow while accounting for exceptions and role-based responsibilities. The process is largely linear but includes decision points and escalation paths for discrepancies. A BPMN diagram could be drawn from this structure, with swimlanes for roles and gateways for decision logic.
