Approach  
We treat each (age, gender) pair as a distinct patient and then follow the normal care-flow for the department in which that patient first appears:

1. For ER patients the usual path is:  
   Register  Triage  (possible X-ray/Lab)  Doctor consultation  Prescription / Discharge  

2. For Surgery patients the usual path is:  
   Register  Doctor consultation  Surgery prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge  

Matching events that have the same (age, gender) and fit these paths chronologically gives three clean, non-overlapping traces.  

Inferred case groupings
