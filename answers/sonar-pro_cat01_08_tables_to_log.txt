Based on the provided tables, I've created a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining. Here's the event log in a structured table format:

Assumptions and Notes:
1. The Case ID is based on the order_id as requested.
2. Activities are derived from the key steps in the order lifecycle.
3. Timestamps are taken directly from the respective tables.
4. Resources/Actors are included where available. For payments, I've used "System" as the actor since it's likely an automated process.
5. Other Attributes column includes relevant additional information from the tables.
6. For orders with multiple item picks (e.g., order 1001), I've created separate events for each pick to preserve granularity.
7. The event log is sorted by Case ID and then by Timestamp to maintain chronological order within each case.
8. Order 1004 is incomplete in the provided data (no delivery, invoice, or payment information), so it only has "Order Created" and "Item Picked" events.
9. All available events for each order_id are included, maintaining the chronological correctness of the process flow.

This event log provides a comprehensive view of the order-to-cash process, suitable for process mining analysis.
