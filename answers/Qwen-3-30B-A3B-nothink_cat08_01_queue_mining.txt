# **Comprehensive Process Mining and Queue Mining Analysis for Patient Flow Optimization in a Multi-Specialty Outpatient Clinic**

---

## **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

### **Definition of Waiting Time (Queue Time)**

In the context of this outpatient clinic, **waiting time (queue time)** is defined as the **time between the completion of one activity and the start of the next activity** in a patient’s visit. This includes both **idle time** (e.g., waiting for a nurse after registration) and **handover delays** (e.g., waiting for a doctor to become available after a nurse assessment).

For example, in the event log:

- **Registration (Complete)**  **Nurse Assessment (Start)** = Waiting time = 9:15:20 – 9:08:45 = **6 minutes 35 seconds**

This metric is critical for identifying where patients are waiting in the process and how long they are kept waiting.

---

### **Key Metrics for Queue Characterization**

To characterize the queues, the following metrics are calculated for each activity pair (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment, Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation, etc.):

| Metric | Description | Example Use Case |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Average Waiting Time** | Mean time between completion of one activity and the start of the next | Identify typical delays in the process |
| **Median Waiting Time** | Middle value of all waiting times | Robust measure against outliers |
| **Maximum Waiting Time** | Longest observed waiting time | Identify extreme delays that may affect patient satisfaction |
| **90th Percentile Waiting Time** | Time by which 90% of patients have been processed | Focus on the most severe delays |
| **Queue Frequency** | Number of times a particular queue occurs | Identify frequently occurring bottlenecks |
| **Number of Cases with Excessive Wait** | Cases where waiting time exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., >15 minutes) | Prioritize queues with high patient impact |

---

### **Identifying the Most Critical Queues**

The **most critical queues** are those that:

- Have the **longest average or 90th percentile waiting times**
- Are **frequently encountered**
- **Affect high-priority patients** (e.g., urgent cases, new patients)
- **Contribute significantly to overall visit duration**
- **Cause the most patient dissatisfaction**

To prioritize, we can use a **multi-criteria scoring system** that weights:

- **Average Waiting Time**
- **Frequency of Queue**
- **Impact on Patient Type (Urgent vs. Normal)**
- **Contribution to Total Visit Duration**

For example, a queue like **Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation** may have a long average wait, occur frequently, and significantly delay care for urgent patients, making it a top priority.

## **2. Root Cause Analysis**

### **Potential Root Causes of Significant Queues**

#### **A. Resource Bottlenecks**
- **Staffing shortfalls**: Limited number of nurses or doctors leading to long waits for availability.
- **Room or equipment constraints**: Only one ECG machine or limited exam rooms causing delays.
- **Unbalanced workload**: Some staff may be overburdened while others are underutilized.

#### **B. Activity Dependencies and Handovers**
- **Sequential dependencies**: A patient must wait for a nurse before a doctor can see them.
- **Poor coordination**: Lack of communication between departments or staff.
- **Delays in handover**: Nurses may not be available immediately after completing an assessment.

#### **C. Variability in Activity Durations**
- **Service time variability**: Some patients take longer than others (e.g., complex cases, equipment malfunctions).
- **Unpredictable arrival patterns**: Peaks in patient arrivals can overwhelm the system.

#### **D. Appointment Scheduling Policies**
- **Overbooking or underbooking**: Patients may be scheduled too closely together.
- **Lack of buffer time**: No time reserved for unexpected delays or handovers.

#### **E. Patient Type and Urgency Differences**
- **Urgent patients** may be prioritized, leading to **longer waits for non-urgent patients**.
- **New vs. follow-up patients** may have different workflows, leading to **inconsistent waiting times**.

### **Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Identification**

- **Resource Analysis**: Map which staff or rooms are most frequently involved in critical queues.
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identify the activity with the **longest average waiting time** or **highest frequency**.
- **Variant Analysis**: Compare waiting times across different patient types (e.g., new vs. follow-up), urgency levels, and service types.
- **Case Duration Analysis**: Track how waiting times contribute to the **overall visit duration**.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Detect patterns in waiting times over time (e.g., peak hours, day-of-week effects).

These techniques help isolate **systemic issues** (e.g., overburdened staff) from **random fluctuations** (e.g., one-off delays).

## **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Reallocate Resources Based on Queue Analysis**

- **Targeted Queue**: Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation
- **Root Cause**: Nurse shortage or doctor unavailability
- **Data Support**: Resource analysis shows that doctors are often idle during nurse assessments, or nurses are overburdened.
- **Proposed Action**: 
  - **Increase nurse-to-doctor ratio** in high-demand periods.
  - **Use predictive modeling** to schedule doctors based on nurse availability.
- **Expected Impact**: 
  - Reduce average waiting time from **12 minutes to 6–8 minutes**
  - Improve patient satisfaction by **15–20%**

---

### **Strategy 2: Implement Dynamic Scheduling with Buffer Time**

- **Targeted Queue**: Registration  Nurse Assessment
- **Root Cause**: Inefficient appointment scheduling leading to **overlapping patient arrivals**
- **Data Support**: Time series analysis shows **peak hours** with high patient volume and long waiting times.
- **Proposed Action**: 
  - Introduce **dynamic scheduling** with **buffer time** between patient slots.
  - Use **predictive analytics** to estimate service times and adjust appointment slots accordingly.
- **Expected Impact**: 
  - Reduce average waiting time by **10–15%**
  - Decrease overall visit duration by **8–12 minutes**

---

### **Strategy 3: Redesign Patient Flow with Parallel Activities**

- **Targeted Queue**: Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Tests (e.g., ECG, Blood Test)
- **Root Cause**: Sequential process where patients must wait for a doctor before being sent for tests
- **Data Support**: Case duration analysis shows **significant delays** between doctor consultations and diagnostic tests.
- **Proposed Action**: 
  - **Allow nurses to pre-authorize diagnostic tests** after initial assessment.
  - **Parallelize** the doctor consultation and diagnostic test scheduling.
- **Expected Impact**: 
  - Reduce waiting time between doctor and diagnostic tests by **15–20 minutes**
  - Improve overall visit duration by **10–15 minutes**

## **4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

### **Potential Trade-offs and Negative Side-Effects**

- **Shifting Bottlenecks**: Redistributing resources may move the bottleneck to another part of the process (e.g., from doctors to nurses).
- **Increased Costs**: Hiring more staff or purchasing more equipment may increase operational costs.
- **Staff Workload**: Adding buffer time or parallel activities may increase staff workload.
- **Quality of Care**: Rushing through processes may compromise care quality.

### **Balancing Objectives**

To balance these trade-offs:

- **Use Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate the **cost of implementing a strategy** versus the **expected improvement in patient satisfaction and throughput**.
- **Pilot and Iterate**: Implement changes in **phases** and monitor their impact.
- **Engage Staff**: Involve frontline staff in the design of new processes to ensure **feasibility and buy-in**.
- **Maintain Quality Checks**: Ensure that **care quality metrics** (e.g., diagnostic accuracy, patient follow-up) are not compromised.
