After analyzing the event log for the four cases (1001–1004), I identify the following anomalies relative to standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) best practices. The canonical P2P sequence is generally:

> **Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Requisition  Issue Purchase Order (PO)  Receive Goods  Receive Vendor Invoice  Match Invoice to PO (3-way match)  Release Payment  Close Case**

Deviations from this logical and control-dependent sequence may indicate process violations, control weaknesses, fraud risk, or operational errors.

### **Anomaly 1: Case 1002 — Payment Released Before Requisition Approval and Before Goods Receipt**

**Sequence Violation:**
- Payment released at **2024-02-03 07:15**
- Requisition approved only at **2024-02-03 08:00** (AFTER payment!)
- Goods received at **2024-02-04 09:00** (AFTER payment!)

**Why It’s Problematic:**
- **Control Failure:** Requisition approval is a prerequisite for issuing a PO and committing funds. Releasing payment before approval bypasses financial controls and authorization protocols.
- **Fraud & Compliance Risk:** Paying a vendor before verifying that goods were received or that the purchase was even approved opens the door to fraudulent invoices or unauthorized spending.
- **Violation of 3-Way Match:** Standard practice requires matching PO, Goods Receipt, and Invoice before payment. Here, payment precedes both goods receipt and invoice matching (which occurs later at 2024-02-05).

This represents a **severe control breach** and should be flagged for audit and process remediation.

### **Anomaly 2: Case 1003 — Payment Released Before Invoice Received and Before Goods Receipt**

**Sequence Violation:**
- Payment released at **2024-02-08 11:00**
- Vendor invoice received at **2024-02-09 12:00** (AFTER payment)
- Goods received at **2024-02-10 13:00** (AFTER payment)

**Why It’s Problematic:**
- **Premature Payment:** Paying before receiving the invoice or goods violates fundamental P2P controls. There is no verification that what was ordered was delivered or billed correctly.
- **Financial Exposure:** The organization risks overpayment, paying for undelivered goods, or paying incorrect amounts.
- **Audit & Reconciliation Issues:** This creates reconciliation headaches and may violate internal policies or external compliance standards (e.g., SOX, GAAP).

This is another **critical anomaly** indicating either system error, manual override abuse, or process breakdown.

### **Anomaly 3: Case 1004 — Goods Received BEFORE Purchase Order Issued**

**Sequence Violation:**
- Goods received at **2024-02-06 09:00**
- Purchase Order issued at **2024-02-06 09:15** (15 minutes AFTER goods receipt)

**Why It’s Problematic:**
- **Procurement Control Violation:** Receiving goods before a PO is issued means there was no formal commitment or authorization for the purchase at the time of receipt. This undermines procurement policy and budget controls.
- **Risk of Unapproved Spend:** The vendor may have delivered goods based on a verbal or informal request, which circumvents proper sourcing and approval workflows.
- **Matching Difficulty:** Matching the invoice to a PO becomes problematic if the PO is created retroactively — potentially leading to mismatches or manual interventions.

While less severe than paying early, this still represents a **significant process deviation** and control weakness.

### **Case 1001 — No Anomalies**

This case follows the expected sequence:
> Requisition  Approval  PO  Goods Receipt  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close

All dependencies are respected, and timing is logical. This is the **gold standard** for P2P execution.

## **Summary of Anomalies:**

| Case ID | Anomaly Description                                        | Risk Level |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1002    | Payment before approval AND before goods receipt           |  High (Critical) |
| 1003    | Payment before invoice AND before goods receipt            |  High (Critical) |
| 1004    | Goods received before PO issued                            |  Medium          |
| 1001    | No anomalies                                               |  Normal             |

## **Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Audit:** Cases 1002 and 1003 require urgent investigation — determine whether these were manual overrides, system errors, or intentional fraud.
2. **Process Enforcement:** Implement system controls to prevent payment release unless:
   - Requisition is approved
   - PO is issued
   - Goods receipt is recorded
   - Invoice is received and matched (3-way match)
3. **Training & Policy Reinforcement:** Ensure staff understand the mandatory sequence and risks of bypassing controls.
4. **Automated Validation Rules:** Configure workflow/BPM systems to enforce activity sequencing and block out-of-order events.

These anomalies, if systemic, could expose the organization to financial loss, compliance penalties, and audit failures. Proactive detection and correction are essential.

 **Conclusion:** Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 contain process anomalies that violate standard P2P controls. Case 1002 and 1003 are especially critical due to premature payments without verification.
