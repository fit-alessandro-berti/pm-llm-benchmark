Based on standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) best practices, the typical sequence of activities should follow this logical order:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**  
4. **Receive Goods** (Goods Receipt)  
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**  
6. **Match Invoice to PO** (often part of a 2-way or 3-way match involving PO, goods receipt, and invoice)  
7. **Release Payment**  
8. **Close Case**

Deviations from this sequence—especially those that violate causal or control-flow dependencies (e.g., paying before receiving goods or issuing a PO after receiving goods)—can indicate process inefficiencies, control weaknesses, fraud risks, or data errors.

Let’s analyze each case:

---

### **Case 1001 – Normal Flow**
- Sequence: Requisition  Approval  PO  Goods Receipt  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close  
 **No anomalies**. This follows the standard P2P flow.

---

### **Case 1002 – Multiple Anomalies**

**Anomaly 1: Purchase Order issued before Requisition Approval**  
- **Timeline**:  
  - 08:30: Create Purchase Requisition  
  - 08:40: **Issue Purchase Order**  
  - **08:00 next day**: Approve Purchase Requisition  

 The **PO is issued before the requisition is approved**, which violates internal controls. Approval should precede PO issuance to ensure proper authorization and budgetary compliance.

**Anomaly 2: Payment released before Goods Receipt and before Invoice Matching**  
- **Timeline**:  
  - 07:00: Vendor Invoice Received  
  - **07:15: Release Payment**  
  - 08:00: Approve Purchase Requisition (still not done!)  
  - Next day: Receive Goods (Feb 4)  
  - Feb 5: Match Invoice to PO  

 **Payment is made before goods are received and before matching the invoice to the PO**. This is a **critical control failure**. It exposes the organization to:
- Risk of paying for undelivered or incorrect goods
- Inability to dispute invoices
- Potential fraud (e.g., paying fake vendors)

This sequence suggests either:
- System or logging error (timestamps incorrect), or  
- Serious breakdown in financial controls.

### **Case 1003 – Anomalous Timing and Order**

**Anomaly: Payment released before Invoice Received and before Goods Receipt**  
- **Timeline**:  
  - Feb 2: Requisition  Approval  PO issued  
  - **Feb 8: Release Payment**  
  - **Feb 9: Vendor Invoice Received** (after payment!)  
  - Feb 10: Receive Goods (after payment!)  
  - Feb 11: Match Invoice to PO (after payment!)

 **Payment occurs before both the invoice and goods receipt**—a major red flag.  
In a proper P2P process:
- Payment should only occur **after** a successful 3-way match (PO, goods receipt, invoice).
- Paying **before** receiving the invoice or goods violates fundamental procurement controls.

This could indicate:
- Pre-payment for special contracts (e.g., deposits), but even then, it should be documented and justified.
- **Uncontrolled spending** or **fraudulent activity** if not properly authorized.

Without evidence of a pre-approved advance payment arrangement, this is highly irregular.

### **Case 1004 – Goods Received Before PO Issued**

**Anomaly: Receive Goods before Purchase Order is issued**  
- **Timeline**:  
  - Feb 5: Requisition  Approval  
  - **Feb 6, 09:00: Receive Goods**  
  - **Feb 6, 09:15: Issue Purchase Order** (15 minutes after goods receipt!)

 **Goods are received before the PO exists**. This breaks the standard control that goods should only be accepted against a valid PO.

Implications:
- No contractual basis for the delivery
- Risk of accepting unauthorized purchases
- Complicates 3-way matching (PO didn’t exist at time of receipt)
- May indicate "maverick spending" or emergency procurement without proper controls

While emergency purchases sometimes occur, the PO should ideally be issued **before or at the time of delivery**, not after—even by minutes. The near-simultaneous timing suggests either:
- Backdating of PO, or  
- Weak procurement discipline.

### **Summary of Anomalies**

| Case ID | Anomaly | Why It’s Problematic |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **1002** | PO issued before requisition approval; payment before goods receipt, invoice matching, and even approval | Bypasses authorization controls; high fraud and financial risk |
| **1003** | Payment released before invoice received and before goods receipt | Violates 3-way match principle; risk of paying for undelivered goods |
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issued | Undermines procurement controls; may lead to unapproved spending |

---

### **Conclusion**

Cases **1002**, **1003**, and **1004** exhibit significant deviations from standard P2P process logic. These anomalies suggest weaknesses in internal controls, potential compliance violations, or operational inefficiencies. In particular:

- **Case 1002** shows the most severe control failures (payment before receipt and approval).
- **Case 1003**’s early payment without supporting documents is financially risky.
- **Case 1004** reflects poor procurement discipline.

Organizations should investigate these cases to determine whether they result from process exceptions (e.g., emergencies with proper justification) or indicate systemic control gaps requiring remediation.
