## High-Level Process Steps From Event Log

Based on the provided event log sample, here are the high-level process steps identified, their justifications, and proposed names:

**1.  Material Handling**  

   - **Justification:** These events encompass the initial acquisition and preparation of raw materials for processing.  They involve retrieving the appropriate material, verifying its identity (barcode scan), positioning it on a designated work surface (table), and preparing it for further operations (alignment, preheating).  
   - **Events:**
      - Retrieve raw metal sheet   
      - Scan barcode
      - Place metal sheet on table  
      - Align metal sheet
      - Preheat metal sheet 

**2. Assembly**

   - **Justification:**  This stage involves the construction or joining of component parts. It includes precisely selecting and using a welding tool (picking up), performing welding operations on specific points (corners) of the metal sheet, and recording the type of weld performed.
   - **Events:**
      - Pick up welding tool   
      - Weld corner A
      - Weld corner B    

**3. Quality Inspection**

   - **Justification:** This step focuses on ensuring the quality and integrity of the welded assembly.  It involves using a dedicated sensor to assess the strength and quality of the welds and recording the results (integrity score).
   - **Events:**
      - Measure weld integrity   

**4. Surface Treatment**

   - **Justification:** This phase protects and finishes the welded component. It includes applying a protective coating (e.g., polyurethane) and then drying it to ensure proper adherence. 
   - **Events:** 
      - Apply protective coating  
      - Dry coating 

**5. Final Inspection &  Acceptance**

   - **Justification:**  This stage involves a visual check by an operator to confirm the overall quality, completion, and adherence to specifications.
   - **Events:**  
      - Visual check   



**Overall Reasoning**

The grouping is based on temporal proximity, resource type, and logical relationships between events. 

* **Temporal:** Events occurring in close succession within a case are more likely to belong to the same high-level step.
* **Resource Type:** Consistent use of a specific resource type (e.g., Robot Arm, operator, sensor) often indicates a shared task or phase.
* **Logical Flow:** Events that logically follow each other (e.g., welding followed by checking weld integrity) represent sequential steps within a process.


This aggregation enhances the readability and comprehension of the event log by revealing the underlying manufacturing workflow in a more structured and meaningful manner.
