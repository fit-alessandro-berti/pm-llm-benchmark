Rationale for added constraints:
1) Responded-existence and coexistence with ManualReview: Any decision involving sensitive applicants (Approve_Minority, Reject_Minority, Approve_Sensitive, Reject_Sensitive) must coexist with ManualReview, ensuring an additional human-in-the-loop step for fairness and consistency.
2) Response and chainresponse enforcing BiasMitigationCheck: After any sensitive attribute check (race, gender, age), a BiasMitigationCheck must occur, and immediately if needed via chainresponse, preventing snap decisions based directly on sensitive data.
3) Precedence before decisions: Approve/Reject (including sensitive variants) require a prior BiasMitigationCheck, guaranteeing that mitigation happens before finalizing outcomes.
4) Non-succession and non-chain-succession from sensitive checks to decisions: Blocks direct or immediate decision-making right after sensitive attribute disclosure, reducing the risk of biased outcomes based solely on these attributes.
5) ManualReview and BiasMitigationCheck existence and response to FinalDecision: Ensures fairness checks are included and that the process progresses to a FinalDecision only after mitigation steps, creating a controlled and auditable pathway.
