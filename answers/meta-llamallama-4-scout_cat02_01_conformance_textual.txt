## Step 1: Understanding the Normative Process Description
The normative process for handling orders starts with "Receive order," followed by "Check inventory." If the inventory is sufficient, the process proceeds with "Authorize payment," then "Package items," "Ship order," and finally "Close order." If the inventory is insufficient, after "Check inventory," the process should go to "Cancel order" and then "Close order."

## 2: Identifying Key Constraints
Key constraints include:
- "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
- "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
- "Ship order" must occur after "Package items" and not after "Cancel order."
- "Close order" must be the final activity.

## 3: Analyzing Case 1
Case 1 sequence: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order.
This sequence follows the normative process for sufficient inventory: Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. Thus, Case 1 does not violate the normative process.

## 4: Analyzing Case 2
Case 2 sequence: Receive order, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
This sequence violates the normative process because "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which contradicts the constraint that "Authorize payment" must happen before "Package items."

## 5: Analyzing Case 3
Case 3 sequence: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order.
This sequence violates the normative process for two reasons:
1. "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order," which is unnecessary and incorrect given that the order is canceled.
2. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which is incorrect because shipping should not happen after cancellation.

## 6: Analyzing Case 4
Case 4 sequence: Receive order, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order.
This sequence follows the normative process for insufficient inventory: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. Thus, Case 4 does not violate the normative process.

## 7: Analyzing Case 5
Case 5 sequence: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
This sequence violates the normative process because "Ship order" occurs before "Package items," which is not allowed. "Package items" must happen before shipping.

## 8: Summarizing Violations
- Case 2 violates the process by having "Package items" before "Authorize payment."
- Case 3 violates the process in two ways: unnecessary "Authorize payment" before cancellation and "Ship order" after cancellation.
- Case 5 violates the process by having "Ship order" before "Package items."

The final answer is: $\boxed{2, 3, 5}$
