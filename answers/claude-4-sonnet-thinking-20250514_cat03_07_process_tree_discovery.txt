Looking at the event log, I can identify the following patterns across the three cases:

**Case 1**: RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC
**Case 2**: RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC  
**Case 3**: RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

From this analysis, I can see:

1. **Fixed sequence at start**: All cases begin with RA  VF  AE
2. **Optional missing info loop**: After AE, there's either:
   - Direct progression to AD (Case 2)
   - One or more RMI activities followed by VF re-validation (Cases 1 & 3)
3. **Fixed sequence at end**: All cases end with AD  SC  AC

The key insight is that RMI can occur multiple times (as seen in Case 3), followed by a single VF re-validation step, before proceeding to the approval decision.

**Final Process Tree:**

```
-> (
  'RA',
  -> (
    'VF', 
    -> (
      'AE',
      -> (
        X(
          tau,
          -> (
            *('RMI', tau),
            'VF'
          )
        ),
        -> (
          'AD',
          -> (
            'SC',
            'AC'
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

**Explanation:**
- The main flow is a sequence: RA  VF  AE  [optional part]  AD  SC  AC
- The optional part uses XOR choice between:
  - `tau` (skip the missing info handling)
  - A sequence of: loop for RMI requests + VF re-validation
- The loop `*('RMI', tau)` allows RMI to be executed one or more times
- After the RMI loop, VF performs re-validation before proceeding to approval

This model captures all observed traces while maintaining simplicity and business logic coherence.
