Here’s a detailed walk-through of the process, step by step, showing what happens, why, and how the flows split, join or loop back.

1. Receive Customer Request  
   • Task A “Receive Customer Request”  
     – Front-office logs the incoming order or inquiry, captures all necessary data (customer ID, product codes, quantities, specs).

2. Classify Request: Standard vs. Custom  
   • XOR Gateway “Check Request Type”  
     – Exclusive decision: exactly one path is taken  
     – If the product/configuration matches a predefined “standard” offering  go Standard Path  
     – Otherwise (new configuration, bespoke specs)  go Custom Path

3. Standard Path  
   3.1. Perform Standard Validation  
     • Task B1 “Perform Standard Validation”  
       – Verify order completeness (correct part numbers, quantities, customer data)  
       – Check that the request falls within standard terms (no special discounts, configurations, or approvals needed yet)  
   3.2. Run Parallel Checks  
     • ANDsplit Gateway “Run Parallel Checks”  
       – Launch two independent checks at once to save time  
       • Task C1 “Credit Check” – Ensure customer’s account is in good standing, within credit limit  
       • Task C2 “Inventory Check” – Verify on-hand stock or back-order status  
     • AND-join Gateway “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
       – Wait until both C1 and C2 finish (neither result can be skipped)  
   3.3. Calculate Delivery Date  
     • Task D “Calculate Delivery Date”  
       – Based on inventory results, lead times, production capacity, shipping constraints  
       – Generates a promised delivery date or earliest ship date  

4. Custom Path  
   4.1. Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis  
     • Task B2 “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
       – Technical review of requested customization (engineering, tooling, materials)  
       – Resource check (can we produce it? timeline? cost?)  
   4.2. Is Customization Feasible?  
     • XOR Gateway “Is Customization Feasible?”  
       – If No  Task E2 “Send Rejection Notice”  End Event (customer informed we can’t comply)  
       – If Yes  Task E1 “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
         • Dimension/spec drafting, cost build-up, margin & pricing, draft formal quote  

5. Converge Paths & Check for Approval  
   • After Task D (standard) or Task E1 (custom) completes, the two branches reunite at an XOR Gateway “Is Approval Needed?”  
     – Criteria might include: order value above threshold, special discount applied, high-risk customer, technical complexity, etc.  
   • Two possible routes:  
     a) No Approval Needed  Task G “Generate Final Invoice”  
     b) Yes Approval Needed  Task F “Obtain Manager Approval”

6. Manager Approval Sub-process  
   6.1. Obtain Manager Approval  
     • Task F “Obtain Manager Approval”  
       – Package request summary (price, delivery date, risk factors) and send to authorized manager  
   6.2. Manager’s Decision:  
     • XOR Gateway “Is Approval Granted?”  
       – If Yes  Task G “Generate Final Invoice”  
       – If No  Task H “Re-evaluate Conditions”  
         • Revise quote or delivery terms (e.g. adjust price, extend lead time, tighten payment terms)  
         • Then loop back:  
           – For Custom Path  back to Task E1 “Prepare Custom Quotation” (new quote)  
           – For Standard Path  back to Task D “Calculate Delivery Date” (new delivery proposal)

7. Finalization  
   • Task G “Generate Final Invoice”  
     – Create official billing document with final prices, terms, delivery dates  
   • Task I “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
     – Email or portal notification of order acceptance, invoice, delivery schedule  
   • End Event

Gateways Explained  
• XOR (Exclusive OR) gateways enforce a single-choice branching or merging. Only one outgoing path is taken based on conditions.  
• AND gateways split work into parallel streams (AND-split) or wait for all parallel streams to finish (AND-join).

Path Convergence & Loops  
• Standard and Custom converge at “Is Approval Needed?”  
• After invoice is generated and confirmation sent, the process ends.  
• If manager rejects (in the approval sub-process), Task H sends the flow back to either  
   – E1 (custom quotation) or  
   – D (delivery-date calc for standard)  
  thus allowing rework until manager approval is obtained (or the customer is ultimately rejected).

Key Differences: Standard vs. Custom  
• Standard requests follow a template: light validation + parallel credit/inventory checks + delivery calculation.  
• Custom requests require feasibility analysis and a bespoke quotation; they may also be rejected outright if infeasible.  
• Only the customquotation branch ends early on infeasibility; the standard branch always proceeds to delivery calc.

Approval & Rework Triggers  
• Approval is triggered by business rules (high order value, deep discount, new customer, complex configuration).  
• If approval is denied, the proposal is reworked (price, terms, delivery) and resubmitted until approved or customer rejects.
