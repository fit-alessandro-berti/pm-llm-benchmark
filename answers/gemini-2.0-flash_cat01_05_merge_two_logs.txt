print("\nExplanation and Decisions:")
print("1. **Timestamp Tolerance:** A tolerance of 2 seconds was used to match events with slightly different timestamps. This accounts for clock skew between systems.")
print("2. **Matching Logic:** Events were matched based on order_id and timestamp proximity. If two events had the same order_id and were within the tolerance window, they were considered to represent the same activity.")
print("3. **Timestamp Selection:**  Log A's timestamp was selected as the primary timestamp for merged events because it's assumed to represent when the event was received, which is a relevant point in the timeline.")
print("4. **Attribute Merging:** All attributes from both logs were included in the merged event.  When an event existed in both logs, and timestamp fields conflicted, both log timestamps were included. All other attributes from Log B were added to the merged event.")
print("5. **Naming Conflicts:**  When event names differed, but were deemed to represent the same activity, the naming was combined into event_type (e.g., 'Order Received/OrderReceived'). A warning message is generated for unhandled namming conflicts.")
print("6. **Non-Overlapping Events:**  'Item Delivered' from Log A and 'Quality Check' from Log B had no matching events in the other log and were included in the merged log as-is.")
print("7. **Sorting:** The final merged log was sorted by timestamp to provide a chronological view of the order fulfillment process.")
```

**Explanation of the code and the decisions made:**

1. **`merge_logs(log_a, log_b, timestamp_tolerance_seconds=2)` Function:**
   - Takes the two event logs as input (lists of strings) and a timestamp tolerance (defaulting to 2 seconds).
   - **Parsing Logs:** The function first parses each log string into a dictionary. This makes it easier to access and manipulate the event attributes.  Timestamps are converted to `datetime` objects for easier comparisons.
   - **Matching Events:** It iterates through the events in `log_a` (primary timeline) and attempts to find a matching event in `log_b`.
     - Matching is based on:
       - `order_id` being identical.
       - The absolute time difference between the timestamps being within the `timestamp_tolerance_seconds`.
   - **Merging Events:** If a match is found:
     - A new `merged_event` dictionary is created.
     - The `timestamp` from `log_a` is used as the primary timestamp. Both timestamps are preserved.
     - All attributes from `log_b` are added to the `merged_event`.
     -  Event type is a combination of both (e.g., "Order Received/OrderReceived").
     - The matched event is removed from `log_b` to prevent it from being matched again.
   - **Handling Non-Matches:**  If an event in `log_a` has no match in `log_b`, it's added to the `merged_events` as-is.
   - **Adding Remaining Events:** After processing `log_a`, any events remaining in `log_b` (that were not matched) are added to `merged_events`.
   - **Sorting:**  Finally, the `merged_events` list is sorted by timestamp to ensure chronological order.
   - **Returns:**  The function returns the `merged_events` list, which contains dictionaries representing the merged event log.

2. **Example Usage:**
   - Defines the sample `log_a` and `log_b` event logs as strings.
   - Calls the `merge_logs` function to create the merged log.
   - Prints the merged log in a readable format.

3. **Explanation and Decisions (printed to the console):**  This section provides detailed documentation about the design choices:

   - **Timestamp Tolerance:** Explains the rationale behind the 2-second tolerance (clock skew).
   - **Matching Logic:**  Clarifies the matching criteria (order ID and timestamp proximity).
   - **Timestamp Selection:** Explains why Log A's timestamp is preferred (representing when the event was received).
   - **Attribute Merging:** Details how attributes from both logs are combined into a single record.
   - **Naming Conflicts:** Explains how naming differences are handled by combining both event names.
   - **Non-Overlapping Events:**  Notes how events that only exist in one log are included as-is.
   - **Sorting:**  Emphasizes that the final log is sorted chronologically.

**Key Improvements and Design Choices:**

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The parsing, matching, merging, and sorting logic are well-separated, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Flexibility:** The `timestamp_tolerance_seconds` parameter allows you to adjust the matching sensitivity.
- **Handling Naming Variations:**  The code now addresses potential differences in event naming conventions between the two systems.
- **Preservation of Information:** All information from both logs is preserved in the merged events, even when there are discrepancies (e.g., by including both timestamps).
- **Detailed Documentation:** The printed explanation provides a clear rationale for all the design choices and assumptions.
- **Readability:** The code is well-commented and uses meaningful variable names.
- **Robustness:** Removing matched events from `log_b` ensures that events are not double-matched.
- **Use of Dictionaries:** Representing events as dictionaries simplifies attribute access and manipulation.
- **Error Handling (Implicit):** The `try...except` block handles potential errors during timestamp parsing.  You could extend this for more robust error handling if needed.

This solution provides a well-structured, flexible, and documented approach to merging event logs from different systems.  The decisions made are clearly explained, and the code is designed to be robust and maintainable.
