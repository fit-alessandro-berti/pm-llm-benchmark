**1. Identification of Cases with Long Resolution Times**  
- **Case 102**: 25 hours 10 minutes (Received to Closed).  
- **Case 104**: 24 hours 10 minutes.  
- **Case 105**: 49 hours 5 minutes (**extreme outlier**).  

These cases took significantly longer than the average resolution time (~20.4 hours) and far longer than the faster cases (101: 2h15m, 103: 1h20m).

**2. Root Causes of Delays**  
**a. Escalations to Level-2 Teams**  
- **Case 102** and **105** experienced delays after escalation. For example:  
  - In Case 105, 28 hours elapsed between escalation and the next action (Investigate Issue).  
  - Escalations likely caused handover delays due to Level-2 team backlogs or misprioritization.  

**b. Long Waiting Times Between Activities**  
- **Case 104**: 3.5-hour gap between assignment to Level-1 and investigation.  
- **Case 102**: 19-hour delay between investigation and resolution (possibly due to non-working hours or resource unavailability).  

**c. Delays Post-Investigation**  
- In Cases 102, 104, and 105, resolving the ticket took 19+ hours after investigation. This suggests bottlenecks in finalizing resolutions (e.g., approvals, dependencies).  

**d. Slow Initial Triage/Assignment**  
- **Case 104**: 40-minute delay between receiving and triaging the ticket.

**3. Insights and Recommendations**  
**a. Escalation Process Improvements**  
- **Action**: Implement SLAs for escalated tickets (e.g., Level-2 must act within 2 hours).  
- **Impact**: Reduces idle time post-escalation (e.g., Case 105’s 28-hour gap).  

**b. Real-Time Monitoring of Queues**  
- **Action**: Track time between activities (e.g., Assign → Investigate) and alert teams if thresholds are breached.  
- **Impact**: Addresses delays like Case 104’s 3.5-hour pre-investigation gap.  

**c. Streamline Post-Investigation Steps**  
- **Action**: Automate approvals or empower agents to resolve issues without additional sign-offs.  
- **Impact**: Reduces 19-hour post-investigation delays in Cases 102 and 104.  

**d. Cross-Training Level-1 Agents**  
- **Action**: Train Level-1 agents to handle complex issues, reducing escalations.  
- **Impact**: Prevents escalation-related delays (e.g., Case 102 and 105).  

**e. Extend Support Hours**  
- **Action**: Offer 24/7 coverage or staggered shifts to resolve tickets overnight.  
- **Impact**: Mitigates delays caused by non-working hours (e.g., Case 102’s 19-hour gap).

**Conclusion**  
The longest delays stem from **escalations**, **idle time between critical steps**, and **post-investigation bottlenecks**. By prioritizing escalations, monitoring queues, and streamlining workflows, the organization can significantly reduce resolution times for complex tickets.
