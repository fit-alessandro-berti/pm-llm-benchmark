### **High-Level Activities for Manufacturing Process**  

Based on the provided event log, the low-level events can be grouped into the following **higher-level activities** that represent logical stages in the manufacturing workflow:  

---

### **1. Material Preparation**  
**Low-Level Events Grouped**:  
- Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- Scan barcode  
- Place metal sheet on table  
- Align metal sheet  
- Preheat metal sheet  

**Justification**:  
- These activities involve the initial handling and setup of raw materials before any assembly or processing begins.  
- They are performed in sequence by the same resources (Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1).  
- They represent the **preparation phase** where the material is readied for downstream operations.  

**High-Level Activity Name**:  
- **Material Preparation**

### **2. Assembly**  
**Low-Level Events Grouped**:  
- Pick up welding tool  
- Weld corner A  
- Weld corner B  

**Justification**:  
- These activities involve **joining or fastening components** (welding in this case).  
- They are performed by operators using specific tools (Operator B with ToolID: W-12).  
- They follow a logical sequence where a tool is picked up and then used for assembly tasks.  

**High-Level Activity Name**:  
- **Assembly**

### **3. Quality Inspection**  
**Low-Level Events Grouped**:  
- Measure weld integrity  
- Visual check  

**Justification**:  
- These activities involve **verifying the quality** of the assembly (e.g., weld integrity, visual inspection).  
- They are performed by specialized resources (Quality Sensor #1, Operator C).  
- They ensure the product meets **defect-free standards** before proceeding to coating.  

**High-Level Activity Name**:  
- **Quality Inspection**

### **4. Coating & Finishing**  
**Low-Level Events Grouped**:  
- Apply protective coating  
- Dry coating  

**Justification**:  
- These activities involve **surface treatment** (coating application and drying).  
- They are performed by dedicated units (Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2).  
- They represent the **final finishing stage** before the product is ready for dispatch.  

**High-Level Activity Name**:  
- **Coating & Finishing**

| **Material Preparation**     | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet | Initial handling and setup of raw materials.                                    |
| **Assembly**                 | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                                            | Joining/fastening operations using tools.                                        |
| **Quality Inspection**       | Measure weld integrity, Visual check                                                          | Verifying product meets quality standards.                                      |
| **Coating & Finishing**      | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                                         | Surface treatment and final finishing.                                           |

### **Summary of Grouping Logic**  
- **Temporal Proximity**: Events closely following each other in time are grouped.  
- **Resource Type**: Activities performed by the same resource (e.g., Operator A, Heating Unit) suggest a stage.  
- **Logical Sequence**: Tasks that logically lead into each other (e.g., tool pickup  welding) are aggregated.  
- **Domain Context**: Manufacturing processes typically follow stages like Preparation  Assembly  Inspection  Finishing.  

This grouping simplifies the event log into a **clear, structured workflow**, making it easier to analyze bottlenecks, optimize processes, or compare across different products.
