1.Which cases are slow?

Case | First event | Last event | Total calendar time
-----|-------------|------------|--------------------
2001 | 1-Apr-2024 09:00 | 1-Apr-2024 10:30 | 1 h 30 m
2002 | 1-Apr-2024 09:05 | 2-Apr-2024 11:00 | 1 d 2 h ( 26 h)
2003 | 1-Apr-2024 09:10 | 3-Apr-2024 09:30 | 2 d 0 h 20 m ( 48 h)
2004 | 1-Apr-2024 09:20 | 1-Apr-2024 10:45 | 1 h 25 m
2005 | 1-Apr-2024 09:25 | 4-Apr-2024 14:30 | 3 d 5 h 05 m ( 77 h)

• Fast ( 2 h): 2001, 2004  
• Slow: 2002, 2003, 2005    performance-problem cases

2.What attributes correlate with the long duration?

a. Claim complexity  
• Low-complexity cases (2001, 2004) finish in < 2 h and never contain “Request Additional Documents”.  
• Medium complexity (2002) contains 1 document request and lasts  26 h.  
• High complexity (2003, 2005) contain 2 and 3 document-request loops respectively and last 48 h and 77 h.  
 Every additional “Request Additional Documents” cycle adds roughly a day.

b. Rework / repeated activities  
• Only the slow cases have repeated “Request Additional Documents”.  
• Waiting for customers to deliver the material explains most of the elapsed time (all idle time is between document requests and the next step).

c. Resources  
• Adjuster_Mike (Region A) and Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) handle all medium/high cases and trigger every document request. They may be over-allocated or lack complete checklists, causing multiple partial requests.  
• Manager_Bill approves only high-complexity cases and is involved in the two longest cases; approval is 23 h–>2 days after last document arrival, hinting at bottleneck scheduling.  
• Finance_Alan (Region A) needed 17 h to pay case 2003, whereas Finance_Carl (Region B) pays within 45 m–4 h. Payment delay contributes ~16 h to case 2003.

d. Region  
Average throughput time  
• Region A: (2001 + 2003) / 2  25 h  
• Region B: (2002 + 2004 + 2005) / 3  35 h  
Region B is slightly slower, but the gap is driven mainly by its single high-complexity case 2005. Region effect is secondary to complexity/rework.

3.Likely root causes and mitigation

Root cause 1 – High complexity  fragmented information  multiple document requests  
Why: Customers rarely submit every required proof up front; adjusters ask piecemeal, each cycle incurs customer waiting time.  
Mitigation:  
• Provide customers with a complete checklist or smart web form that enforces mandatory uploads.  
• Run an early triage step that assigns a “complexity score” and routes high scores to a specialised intake team that compiles one consolidated document request.  
• Introduce SLA for “all documents requested in  1 request” KPI for adjusters.

Root cause 2 – Bottleneck approver (Manager_Bill) for high-complexity claims  
Why: Only Manager_Bill signs off complex claims; his queue causes an extra day of idle time.  
Mitigation:  
• Cross-train and authorise Manager_Ann (or others) to approve high-complexity work.  
• Implement load-balancing rules or an “auto-escalate after 4 h” policy.

Root cause 3 – Payment delay with Finance_Alan  
Why: Region A payments wait overnight, whereas Region B finance settles quickly.  
Mitigation:  
• Align finance staffing windows across regions or introduce same-day cut-off SLA.  
• Automate payment generation immediately after approval for amounts below a threshold.

Root cause 4 – Adjuster practices differ by region/resource  
Why: Adjuster_Mike (A) issued 2 requests; Adjuster_Lisa (B) issued 3. Variation suggests inconsistent guidelines.  
Mitigation:  
• Standard operating procedures and checklists; peer review of first document request.  
• Dashboards that show “average number of document requests per claim per adjuster” to trigger coaching.

Quick wins  
 • Monitor “number of document request loops” – every extra loop adds  24 h.  
 • Introduce automated reminders to customers to shorten the waiting between request and delivery.  
 • Add capacity or staggered shifts for critical roles (complex-claim approvers, Region A finance) during peak days.

By tackling the rework on document requests, sharing the approval load, and harmonising finance turnaround times, the slow cases (2002, 2003, 2005) should converge towards the sub-one-day lead time seen in the low-complexity claims.
