Based on the provided process variants, the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group can be identified as follows:

1. **Frequency of treatment paths**: The frequency of treatment paths in the protected group is generally lower than in the unprotected group. This could indicate that the protected group has less access to medical treatment or is less likely to receive treatment.

2. **Path complexity**: The treatment paths in the protected group are often shorter and less complex than those in the unprotected group. For instance, the protected group has more instances of direct diagnosis and treatment (e.g., "Register at FD -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 61), whereas the unprotected group has more instances of multiple examinations and diagnoses before treatment (e.g., "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 1418).

3. **Treatment outcomes**: The protected group has more instances of "Treatment unsuccessful" followed by additional diagnoses and treatments, which could indicate that the protected group is more likely to experience treatment failures or complications. For example, "Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a frequency of 48 in the protected group, whereas the equivalent path in the unprotected group has a frequency of 32.

4. **Performance (execution time)**: The performance (execution time) of treatment paths in the protected group is generally shorter than in the unprotected group, especially for more complex paths. This could indicate that the protected group receives faster treatment, but with potentially lower quality or effectiveness.

5. **Access to expert examinations**: The protected group has fewer instances of expert examinations, which could indicate that the protected group has less access to specialized medical care.

6. **Discharge without treatment**: The protected group has a higher proportion of instances where patients are discharged without receiving treatment (e.g., "Register at ER" with a frequency of 158 and a performance of 0.000), which could indicate that the protected group is more likely to be discharged without receiving adequate medical care.

These differences suggest that the protected group may face barriers to accessing medical care, such as limited access to specialized care, longer wait times, and lower quality treatment. However, more analysis and domain knowledge are required to confirm these findings and identify the root causes of these differences.
