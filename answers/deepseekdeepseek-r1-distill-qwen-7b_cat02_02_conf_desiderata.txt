Okay, so I need to figure out which cases are violating the normative rules and which ones are failing the desiderata. Let's start by understanding the normative rules and then see how they apply to each case.

From Part 1, the strict sequence is:

1. Application Received
2. Credit Check
3. Risk Assessment
4. Loan Decision
5. Inform Applicant
6. If approved: Finalize Documentation
7. Close Case
8. If rejected: Close without Finalize Documentation

So, the order is fixed, and each step must follow the previous one without skipping or changing the order.

Now, looking at the event logs for each case:

**Case 1:**

- Received at 09:00
- Credit Check at 09:30 (within 30 mins)
- Risk Assessment at 10:00 (50 mins after)
- Loan Decision at 11:00 (1 hour after)
- Inform at 13:00 (2 hours after)
- Finalize at 13:30
- Close at 14:00

Everything here follows the sequence perfectly. No skips, order is correct. The timeline seems to follow all the constraints. So, Case 1 is compliant.

**Case 2:**

- Received at 08:00
- Risk Assessment at 08:20 (without prior Credit Check! That's a violation of the normative rules because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment)
- Then Credit Check at 09:00 (after Risk Assessment)
- Loan Decision at 09:30 (rejected)
- Finalize at 10:00 (which is after rejection, violating the rule that if rejected, don't finalize before closing)
- Close at 10:30

So, the key issues here are that the Credit Check was done before Risk Assessment, which is not allowed, and Finalize was done after the rejection, which is also not allowed.

**Case 3:**

- Received at 09:00
- Credit Check at 14:00 (which is 5 hours later, longer than the recommended 24 hours)
- Risk Assessment at 15:00 (one hour after Credit Check)
- Loan Decision at 12:00 (wait, that's earlier than the Risk Assessment? That can't be right. Let me check the timestamps again.

Wait, the event log for Case 3 shows:

- Application Received at 14:00 (Jan 12 09:00)
- Credit Check at 10:00 (Jan 14 10:00)
- Risk Assessment at 11:00 (Jan 14 11:00)
- Loan Decision at 12:00 (Jan 14 12:00)
- Inform Applicant at 16:00 (Jan 16 15:00)
- Finalize at 17:00 (Jan 17 09:00)
- Close at 18:00 (Jan 17 10:00)

Wait, there's a mistake here. The Risk Assessment is before the Loan Decision, which is correct because Risk Assessment comes after Credit Check and before Loan Decision. But the issue is that the Credit Check was done on Jan 14 at 10:00, which is 5 hours after the application was received on Jan 12 at 09:00. That's 5 hours, which is way less than the recommended 24 hours, so that's a desiderata violation.

Additionally, the Inform Applicant was done on Jan 16 at 15:00, which is 48 hours after the Loan Decision on Jan 14 at 12:00. The recommended timeframe is within 48 hours, so this is another desiderata violation.

Also, there's no Follow-up Call mentioned, which is another desiderata point.

So, Case 3 has multiple desiderata issues but no normative violations.

Now, for the desiderata, let's see:

- Case 1 meets all the desiderata as well because it's done within the recommended time and has a follow-up call mentioned.

- Case 2 violated the normative rules, so it's not just a desiderata issue.

- Case 3 violated the desiderata by having Credit Check too late, Inform Applicant too late, and missing a Follow-up Call.

So, summarizing:

Normative violations:

- Case 2: Credit Check before Risk Assessment and Finalize after rejection.

Desiderata violations:

- Case 2: Credit Check too early (violates recommendation but not a rule)
- Case 3: Credit Check too late (5 hours after application), Inform Applicant too late (48 hours after decision), and no Follow-up Call.

I think that's the breakdown. I need to explain each violation clearly and suggest possible justifications. For Case 2, maybe they didn't realize the order was important. For Case 3, perhaps rushed applications or didn't follow up promptly.

### Analysis of Cases

#### 1. Case 1:
- **Normative Compliance:** The process followed the strict sequence without any skips or order changes. All activities were performed in the correct order.
- **Desiderata Compliance:** The process met the recommended timelines (Credit Check within 24 hours, Inform Applicant within 48 hours) and included a Follow-up Call.

#### 2. Case 2:
- **Normative Violations:**
  - **Credit Check before Risk Assessment:** The Credit Check was performed before the Risk Assessment, violating the required sequence.
  - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** Finalization was done after the loan was rejected, which is not allowed.
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Credit Check Timing:** The Credit Check was completed within the recommended timeframe (24 hours after application).
  - **Follow-up Call:** A Follow-up Call was not conducted.

#### 3. Case 3:
- **Normative Compliance:** The process followed the correct sequence, but with some deviations in timing.
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Credit Check Timing:** The Credit Check was completed 5 hours after the application, which is significantly earlier than the recommended 24-hour window.
  - **Inform Applicant Timing:** The Inform step was done 48 hours after the Loan Decision, exceeding the recommended timeframe.
  - **Follow-up Call:** No Follow-up Call was made.

### Summary
- **Normative Violations:**
  - Case 2 violated the sequence of activities (Credit Check before Risk Assessment and Finalize after rejection).
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - Case 2 had a Credit Check completed within the recommended timeframe but missed a Follow-up Call.
  - Case 3 had Credit Check and Inform steps completed outside the recommended timelines and lacked a Follow-up Call.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Case 2:** Ensure proper communication between departments to avoid misordering activities. Conduct a Follow-up Call to maintain alignment.
- **Case 3:** Implement a prompt processing system for Credit Checks and regular follow-ups to adhere to recommended timelines and ensure timely communication.
