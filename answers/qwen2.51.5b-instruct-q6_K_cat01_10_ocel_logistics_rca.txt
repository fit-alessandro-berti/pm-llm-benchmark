Based on the provided data, there seem to be several key areas that can contribute to performance bottlenecks in the "send package" phase of your delivery system:

1. **Multiple Recursive Loops**: The dataset shows numerous times when a package is sent multiple times without being fully processed and potentially causing backlogs or processing reiterations. This could be due to:
   - Incorrect data handling where one event (e.g., creating a package) triggers another (e.g., sending the same package again unnecessarily).
   - Logic not correctly filtering out redundant packages during the process.

2. **Event Rate at Specific Points**: There are multiple events in which the frequency of `send package` is high, such as:
   - The "place order" event leading to a large number of subsequent actions like `confirming order`, `paying order`, and eventually delivering or confirming deliveries.
   - Other instances where `send package` appears very frequently in sequences involving multiple events within different categories.

3. **Dependency on Concurrent Events**: When certain packages need to be processed in parallel with their immediate predecessors, the performance might degrade if these dependencies are not handled properly:
   - In cases like `"create package" -> "place order" -> "send package"` or similar, it's critical that events don’t start running until all dependent tasks have completed, otherwise, there could be wasted resources.

4. **Duration Analysis**: The high duration of `duration = 17985.08` and `17350.80` for packages related to sending packages might indicate an excessive resource use or optimization opportunity in how these actions are handled concurrently versus sequentially.
   - Efficient partitioning of resources across different parts of the processing pipeline would likely improve performance.

5. **Concurrency Limits vs Actual Workflows**: The actual number of events like `send package` and their execution times against theoretical capabilities might suggest limitations related to concurrency rather than logical complexity:
   - If a specific task cannot process requests in parallel due to constraints (like single-threaded systems), then it can lead to poor performance.

6. **Resource Utilization Patterns**: Unbalanced resource usage between concurrent tasks versus sequential ones within the same event set can also affect performance.
   - Understanding how different types of events (e.g., packages sent, order confirmations) use and create resources dynamically under load is crucial.

7. **Latency at Each Action Point**: Analyzing latency across each individual action point will provide insights into where bottlenecks exist due to delays or issues:
   - For example, if `send package` frequently has high latencies (e.g., 14864.62 seconds), then reducing such tasks’ execution time can significantly improve performance.

### Recommendations:

1. **Identify Redundant Event Dependencies**: Use log analysis and correlation rules to spot cycles in event sequences that lead back and forth between similar packages, likely increasing processing load.
   
2. **Implement Efficient Filtering Logic**: For instance, before starting package operations, ensure each subsequent task is uniquely related to the object being processed (package).

3. **Concurrency Tuning**: Review current system concurrency settings for activities around `send package`, aiming for less contention on shared resources.

4. **Latency Analysis & Optimization**: Conduct performance testing under high load conditions to identify exact slowness points and optimize resource allocation there.

5. **Resource Utilization Metrics**: Develop an algorithm that leverages real-time usage tracking capabilities to proactively manage capacity, ensuring there are adequate resources for each concurrent execution batch.

By focusing on optimizing these areas through detailed analysis of performance metrics and effective logging strategy, it should be possible to mitigate the identified bottlenecks, allowing the system to handle more requests without degrading significantly.
