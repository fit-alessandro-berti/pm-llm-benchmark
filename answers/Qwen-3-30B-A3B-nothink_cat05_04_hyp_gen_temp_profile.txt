### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

- **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: The average time is approximately 25 hours with a very low standard deviation (1 hour), which is suspiciously consistent. This may indicate a rigid, automated process or potential data manipulation.

- **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: The average is 7 days with a high standard deviation (2 days), suggesting inconsistent or delayed notification processes, possibly due to backlogs or resource constraints.

- **A to C (Assign to Close)**: The average is only 2 hours, which is unusually fast and may indicate that some claims are being closed prematurely without going through necessary steps like evaluation or approval.

- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: The average time is only 5 minutes, which is extremely short and may suggest that the notification step is being skipped or processed without proper evaluation.

### Hypotheses for the Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:  
   - **Hypothesis**: The approval process may be automated or pre-approved for certain claim types, leading to very consistent time intervals.  
   - **Possible Cause**: Systematic rules or exceptions applied to specific claim types or customer segments.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:  
   - **Hypothesis**: There may be a bottleneck in the notification process, such as manual verification, or delays in communication with the customer.  
   - **Possible Cause**: Inconsistent resource allocation, internal delays, or technical issues in the notification system.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:  
   - **Hypothesis**: Some claims might be closed without completing all necessary steps, possibly due to system errors or user shortcuts.  
   - **Possible Cause**: Inadequate process enforcement or incorrect data entry in the `claim_events` table.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:  
   - **Hypothesis**: The evaluation step may not be fully completed before the notification is sent, or the system may be skipping steps for efficiency.  
   - **Possible Cause**: Process configuration errors, lack of oversight, or automated workflows that bypass evaluation.

### SQL Queries for Verification

#### 1. Identify Claims with Unusually Short or Long Time Intervals

```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.activity AS activity1,
    ce1.timestamp AS timestamp1,
    ce2.activity AS activity2,
    ce2.timestamp AS timestamp2,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id 
    AND ce1.activity = 'R' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 30000 -- 8.33 hours
    OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 90000; -- 25 hours
```

#### 2. Check for Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment

```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.activity AS activity1,
    ce1.timestamp AS timestamp1,
    ce2.activity AS activity2,
    ce2.timestamp AS timestamp2,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id 
    AND ce1.activity = 'A' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200; -- 2 hours
```

#### 3. Identify Claims with Long Approval-to-Notify Delays

```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.activity AS activity1,
    ce1.timestamp AS timestamp1,
    ce2.activity AS activity2,
    ce2.timestamp AS timestamp2,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id 
    AND ce1.activity = 'P' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800; -- 7 days
```

#### 4. Correlate Anomalies with Claim Types or Adjusters

```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
FROM 
    claims c
JOIN 
    claim_events ce1 
    ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'E' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 300
GROUP BY 
    c.claim_type
ORDER BY 
    anomaly_count DESC;
```

#### 5. Check for Claims with Short Evaluate-to-Notify Times

```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id,
    ce1.activity AS activity1,
    ce1.timestamp AS timestamp1,
    ce2.activity AS activity2,
    ce2.timestamp AS timestamp2,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id 
    AND ce1.activity = 'E' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 300; -- 5 minutes
```
