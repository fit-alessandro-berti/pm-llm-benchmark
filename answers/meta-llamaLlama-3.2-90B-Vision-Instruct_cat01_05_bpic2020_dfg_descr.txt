What a delightfully complex process!

After analyzing the data, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process. Please note that this is an interpretation based on the provided data, and some details might be missing or ambiguous.

**Overview**

The process appears to be a workflow for managing employee declarations, which seem to be related to expenses or payments. The process involves multiple stakeholders, including employees, supervisors, administrators, pre-approver, budget owners, and a payment handling system.

**Main Process Flow**

1. An employee submits a declaration ( Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The declaration is then routed to an administrator for approval (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION).
3. If approved, the declaration is sent to a supervisor for final approval (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR). There are two possible pathways for this:
	* Directly from the administrator's approval (frequency: 5133).
	* Via a budget owner's approval (frequency: 2820).
4. Once finally approved, a request for payment is generated (Request Payment).
5. The payment is then handled by a separate system (Payment Handled).

**Rejection and Re-Submission**

If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it is sent back to the employee for revision and re-submission. There are multiple rejection points:

* Rejected by administration (Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION).
* Rejected by pre-approver (Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER).
* Rejected by budget owner (Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER).
* Rejected by supervisor (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR).

In some cases, a rejected declaration can be re-submitted directly by the employee (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

**Additional Pathways and Exceptions**

There are a few additional pathways and exceptions:

* A declaration can be saved by an employee without submitting it (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE).
* A declaration can be routed directly to a pre-approver or administrator for approval without going through the standard submission process (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER).
* In rare cases, a declaration can be rejected by a missing approver (Declaration REJECTED by MISSING).

**Performance Metrics**

The data includes performance metrics, which suggest that each step in the process has a specific processing time or throughput. These metrics might be used to monitor and optimize the process.

Please note that this is a high-level interpretation, and there might be nuances and details that are not immediately apparent from the data.
