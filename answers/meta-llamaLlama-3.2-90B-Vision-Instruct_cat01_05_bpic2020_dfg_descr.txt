The process underlying this data appears to be a workflow for managing employee expense declarations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Employee submits a declaration**: The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration (e.g., an expense report). This is represented by the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" node.

2. **Pre-approval and approval**: The submitted declaration is reviewed by various approvers, including a Pre-approver, Administration, and a Budget Owner. Each of these approvers can either approve or reject the declaration.

3. **Final approval by Supervisor**: If the declaration is approved by the previous approvers, it is sent to the Supervisor for final approval. This is represented by the "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" node.

4. **Request for payment**: Once the declaration is finally approved, a request for payment is generated. This is represented by the "Request Payment" node.

5. **Payment handling**: The payment request is then handled, which is represented by the "Payment Handled" node.

6. **Rejection and resubmission**: If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it is sent back to the employee for resubmission. This is represented by the various "Declaration REJECTED by [Approver]" nodes that connect back to the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" node.

7. **Missing and error handling**: There are also nodes that represent missing or error cases, such as "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" and "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by [Approver]". These nodes are connected to other nodes in the process, indicating that they can occur at various stages.

Some notable observations about the process:

* There are multiple parallel approval paths, indicating that different approvers can review the declaration simultaneously.
* There are also multiple rejection paths, indicating that a declaration can be rejected at various stages and sent back to the employee for resubmission.
* The process appears to have some exceptions and error cases, represented by the "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" and "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by [Approver]" nodes.
* The process has a high frequency of employee submissions and rejections, indicating a high volume of declarations being processed.

Overall, the process appears to be a complex workflow with multiple approval and rejection paths, indicating a need for careful management and coordination to ensure that employee expense declarations are processed efficiently and accurately.
