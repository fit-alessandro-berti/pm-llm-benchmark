To produce the POWL model, we need to identify the atomic activities, choices, and loops from the event log traces and then define their partial order.

**Analysis of the Event Log and Identification of POWL Elements:**

1.  **Atomic Activities (Transitions):**
    *   OR: Order Received
    *   MS: Material Sourcing
    *   QS: Quality Screening
    *   AS: Assembly
    *   IQC: In-line Quality Check
    *   TST: Testing
    *   RT: Re-Testing
    *   PK: Packaging
    *   LB: Labeling
    *   DP: Distribution Planning
    *   D: Dispatch

2.  **Silent Activity:**
    *   `skip`: A `SilentTransition` will be used to represent optional paths (e.g., when an activity can be skipped) or for constructing specific loop semantics as required by the `*(A, B)` operator.

3.  **Loops and Choices (OperatorPOWL):**

    *   **Labeling (LB) Optionality:**
        *   Cases like 1, 3, 4, 5 show `PK` -> `LB` -> `DP`.
        *   Case 2 shows `PK` -> `DP` (skipping LB).
        *   This is a clear **exclusive choice (XOR)** between `LB` and a silent activity (`skip`).
        *   Model: `X(LB, skip)`

    *   **Testing (TST) and Re-Testing (RT) Loop:**
        *   Pattern: `TST` can be followed by `RT`, which then leads back to `TST`. This can repeat.
        *   Cases 2, 4: `TST` (exit loop)
        *   Cases 1, 3: `TST`, `RT`, `TST` (one cycle of `RT` and `TST`)
        *   Case 5: `TST`, `RT`, `TST`, `RT`, `TST` (two cycles of `RT` and `TST`)
        *   The `*(A, B)` loop is defined as "execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again, repeating until the loop is exited".
        *   This perfectly fits by setting `A = TST` and `B = RT`.
        *   Model: `*(TST, RT)`

    *   **Assembly (AS) and In-line Quality Check (IQC) Process:**
        *   The phrase "IQC: In-line Quality Check (repeated if needed)" is key. This implies `IQC` itself can be repeated.
        *   Pattern from traces:
            *   Case 4: `AS` (no IQC sequence)
            *   Cases 1, 2: `AS`, `IQC`, `AS`
            *   Case 3: `AS`, `IQC`, `IQC`, `AS`, `IQC`, `AS`
            *   Case 5: `AS`, `IQC`, `AS`, `IQC`, `AS`, `IQC`, `AS`
        *   To model `IQC` being repeated, we can use an inner loop `*(IQC, skip)` where `skip` allows the `IQC` execution to complete and potentially loop back to another `IQC`. This generates sequences like `IQC`, `IQC, IQC`, `IQC, IQC, IQC`, etc. Let's call this `repeatable_IQC`.
        *   Now, consider the outer structure with `AS`: The pattern is `AS`, then optionally `(repeatable_IQC, AS)` sequence repeating. This again fits the `*(A, B)` loop where `A = AS` and `B = repeatable_IQC`.
        *   Model: `*(AS, *(IQC, skip))`

4.  **Overall Process Flow (StrictPartialOrder):**
    *   From the log, the activities generally follow a sequential path.
    *   `OR` -> `MS` -> `QS` -> `AS_IQC_loop` -> `TST_RT_loop` -> `PK` -> `LB_choice` -> `DP` -> `D`.
    *   There are no indications of concurrent execution paths at this top level.

**POWL Model Construction:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Define all atomic activities (Transitions)
OR_node = Transition(label="OR")
MS_node = Transition(label="MS")
QS_node = Transition(label="QS")
AS_node = Transition(label="AS")
IQC_node = Transition(label="IQC")
TST_node = Transition(label="TST")
RT_node = Transition(label="RT")
PK_node = Transition(label="PK")
LB_node = Transition(label="LB")
DP_node = Transition(label="DP")
D_node = Transition(label="D")

# Define a silent transition for optional paths or internal loop mechanics
skip_node = SilentTransition()

# 2. Define complex POWL models using OperatorPOWL

# 2.1. Repeatable In-line Quality Check (IQC)
# The description "IQC (repeated if needed)" suggests IQC can repeat itself.
# Using the *(A, B)* loop where B is a silent transition:
# *(IQC, skip_node)* generates sequences like: IQC, IQC, IQC, ...
repeatable_IQC_model = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC_node, skip_node])

# 2.2. Assembly (AS) and In-line Quality Check (IQC) Process Flow
# The overall pattern is AS followed by a possible sequence of (repeatable IQC then AS).
# This fits the *(A, B)* loop: A is AS_node, B is the repeatable_IQC_model.
# Sequences generated:
# - AS (exit) - Matches Case 4
# - AS, repeatable_IQC_model, AS (exit)
#   - If repeatable_IQC_model produces IQC: AS, IQC, AS (Matches Case 1, 2)
#   - If repeatable_IQC_model produces IQC, IQC: AS, IQC, IQC, AS
# - AS, repeatable_IQC_model, AS, repeatable_IQC_model, AS (exit)
#   - If repeatable_IQC_model produces IQC (twice): AS, IQC, AS, IQC, AS (Matches Case 5)
#   - If repeatable_IQC_model produces IQC, IQC then IQC: AS, IQC, IQC, AS, IQC, AS (Matches Case 3)
AS_IQC_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS_node, repeatable_IQC_model])

# 2.3. Testing (TST) and Re-Testing (RT) Loop
# This is a direct application of the *(A, B)* loop definition:
# Execute TST, then optionally RT and TST again.
TST_RT_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST_node, RT_node])

# 2.4. Labeling (LB) Choice (Optional)
# LB can be performed or skipped. This is an exclusive choice (XOR).
LB_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB_node, skip_node])

# 3. Define the main process flow using StrictPartialOrder
# The top-level components are executed in a strict sequential order as observed in the logs.

# List all top-level POWL models that form the main process sequence
process_nodes = [
    OR_node,
    MS_node,
    QS_node,
    AS_IQC_loop,      # Encapsulates Assembly and Quality Check logic
    TST_RT_loop,      # Encapsulates Testing and Re-Testing logic
    PK_node,
    LB_choice,        # Encapsulates optional Labeling
    DP_node,
    D_node
]

# Create the root POWL model as a StrictPartialOrder
root_powl_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=process_nodes)

# Add edges to define the strict sequential order between these top-level components
root_powl_model.order.add_edge(OR_node, MS_node)
root_powl_model.order.add_edge(MS_node, QS_node)
root_powl_model.order.add_edge(QS_node, AS_IQC_loop)
root_powl_model.order.add_edge(AS_IQC_loop, TST_RT_loop)
root_powl_model.order.add_edge(TST_RT_loop, PK_node)
root_powl_model.order.add_edge(PK_node, LB_choice)
root_powl_model.order.add_edge(LB_choice, DP_node)
root_powl_model.order.add_edge(DP_node, D_node)

# The 'root_powl_model' now represents the complete process.
