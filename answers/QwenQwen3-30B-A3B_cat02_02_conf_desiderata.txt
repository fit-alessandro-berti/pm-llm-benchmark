Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the requirements from both Part 1 and Part 2. 

Starting with Part 1: The normative process behavior has strict rules. The process must follow a specific sequence. Let me list out the steps again to make sure I have them right. The sequence is: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  (If Approved: Finalize Documentation)  Close Case. 

The key constraints are that the order must be strictly followed. So, for example, Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment, and Risk Assessment before Loan Decision. Also, after the Loan Decision, you have to Inform the Applicant. Then, if approved, finalize documentation before closing. If rejected, close without finalizing.

Now, looking at the event logs for each case. Let's go through each Case ID one by one.

Case 1:
- The activities are in the correct order: Application Received, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. All steps are followed in sequence. No violations here. The timing for Credit Check is 30 minutes after application, which is within 24 hours, so that's good. Inform Applicant is 2 hours after decision, which is within 48 hours. The follow-up call isn't mentioned, but that's a desideratum, not a strict rule. So Case 1 is compliant.

Case 2:
- Application Received. Then directly to Risk Assessment without Credit Check. That's a violation of the normative rule because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then later, they do the Credit Check, but the order is wrong. Also, after Loan Decision (Rejected), they do Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed. Then Close Case. So two violations here: 1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and 2) Finalize Documentation after rejection. So Case 2 is violating the normative rules.

Case 3:
- Application Received. Then Credit Check happens two days later. The normative rules don't have a time constraint, but the desiderata says Credit Check should be within 24 hours. So that's a desideratum violation. Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant 2 days after decision. The desiderata says Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision, which is 2 days, so that's exactly 48 hours. Wait, the timestamp for Inform Applicant is 2024-01-16 15:00. The Loan Decision was on 2024-01-14 12:00. The time between is 2 days and 3 hours, which is over 48 hours. So that's a desideratum violation. Then Finalize Documentation and Close Case. The follow-up call is missing, another desideratum. So Case 3 has desideratum violations but no normative rule violations. The sequence is correct: Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision, Inform, Finalize, Close. So no normative violations here.

Now, for the second part, the desiderata. The desiderata are the timing and follow-up call. So for Case 3, the Credit Check is more than 24 hours after application. The Inform Applicant is more than 48 hours after decision. And no follow-up call. So those are the desiderata issues.

For the third part, possible interpretations. For Case 2, the Risk Assessment before Credit Check might be an error, but maybe they had to do it in a different order due to some system error or manual intervention. The Finalize Documentation after rejection could be a mistake, perhaps the system allowed it, but they should have followed the rules. For Case 3, the delays might be due to external factors like processing delays, or maybe the applicant was unavailable, hence the follow-up call wasn't done. But since these are just recommendations, they can be justified as not critical.

I need to make sure I didn't miss any other cases. The event log only has Cases 1, 2, 3. So that's all. Now, structure the answer accordingly.
</think>

### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**  
**Case 2** is the only case that violates the strict normative constraints.  

**Violations in Case 2:**  
- **Incorrect Order of Activities:**  
  - The **Risk Assessment** was performed **before the Credit Check** (Activity 2: "Risk Assessment" occurs at 2024-01-11 08:20, while the Credit Check occurs later at 2024-01-11 08:20). This directly violates the rule that **Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment**.  
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection:**  
  - The **Finalize Documentation** activity (2024-01-11 10:00) was performed **after a Loan Decision (Rejected)**, which is explicitly prohibited. The normative rules state that documentation should **not be finalized** if the loan is rejected.  

**Conclusion:** Case 2 violates two strict rules and is non-compliant with the process.

### **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions**  
**Case 3** fails to meet the recommended best practices (desiderata), though these are not critical violations.  

**Desiderata Violations in Case 3:**  
- **Credit Check Delayed Beyond 24 Hours:**  
  - The Credit Check occurred on **2024-01-14 10:00**, **2 days after the Application Received** (2024-01-12 09:00). This violates the desideratum of completing the Credit Check **within 24 hours** of the application.  
- **Inform Applicant Delayed Beyond 48 Hours:**  
  - The Inform Applicant activity occurred on **2024-01-16 15:00**, **2 days and 3 hours after the Loan Decision (Approved)** (2024-01-14 12:00). This exceeds the recommended 48-hour window.  
- **Missing Follow-up Call:**  
  - No **Follow-up Call** was recorded before closing the case, which is encouraged but not mandatory.  

**Conclusion:** Case 3 deviates from the desiderata but adheres to the strict normative rules.

### **3. Interpretations/Justifications for Observed Behaviors**  
- **Case 2:**  
  - **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:** This could be due to a system error, manual intervention, or a misconfigured workflow. While it violates the strict sequence, it may reflect a temporary process breakdown.  
  - **Finalize Documentation After Rejection:** This might stem from a lack of automated checks or human error. For example, an employee might have mistakenly initiated documentation before confirming the rejection.  

- **Case 3:**  
  - **Delayed Credit Check and Inform Applicant:** These delays could be attributed to external factors (e.g., resource constraints, applicant unavailability, or third-party dependencies). The desiderata are flexible, so such delays may be justified as unavoidable in practice.  
  - **No Follow-up Call:** This could be due to operational oversight or a prioritization of other tasks. Since the follow-up call is not a strict requirement, it may be omitted in time-sensitive scenarios.  

---

### **Summary**  
- **Normative Violations:** Only **Case 2** is non-compliant with strict rules.  
- **Desiderata Violations:** **Case 3** misses timing and follow-up recommendations.  
- **Justifications:** Non-critical deviations in Case 3 are plausible due to external factors, while Case 2’s violations likely reflect process errors.
