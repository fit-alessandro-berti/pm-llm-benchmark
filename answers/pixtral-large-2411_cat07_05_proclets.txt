The image presents a detailed visualization of a process involving lab visits and lab tests using proclet classes, channels, and performatives. There are three main parts to the image: (a) a workflow diagram of two proclet classes connected through two channels, (b) a class diagram containing the two proclet classes, and (c) an example of a performative.

### (a) Two Proclet Classes Connected Through Two Channels
This part of the image depicts the interactions between two proclet classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test." The process involves several steps:

1. **Lab Visit (Starting Point)**
   - A doctor submits an order entry.
   - A lab assistant takes a blood sample from the patient.

2. **Interaction Between Proclets**
   - The "Lab visit" proclet sends a message to the "Lab test" proclet via the "Order system" channel.
   - The "Lab test" proclet performs the test and makes a report.

3. **Receiving and Judging Results**
   - The "Lab visit" proclet receives the result.
   - A doctor judges the results.
   - If results are acceptable, the process ends.
   - If not, the lab assistant performs the tests again and provides updated results.

4. **Final Steps**
   - The lab assistant sends the final report.
   - The process concludes.

### (b) Class Diagram Containing the Two Proclet Classes
This part of the image shows a class diagram with two classes:
- **Lab visit**
  - Requires an instance of the "Lab test" class.
- **Lab test**
  - Is required by the "Lab visit" class.

### (c) Example of a Performative
This part illustrates an example of a performative message, which is a communication action in the system:
- **Time**: 11:00
- **Channel**: Order system
- **Sender**: Lab visit - Johns
- **Receivers**: Lab test - HGB John
- **Action**: Create
- **Content**: "Can you perform a HGB test for Johns?"
- **Scope**: Private
- **Direction**: OUT

The performative message demonstrates how the "Lab visit" proclet sends a request to the "Lab test" proclet to perform a hemoglobin (HGB) test.

Overall, the image illustrates how proclet classes and channels facilitate communication and workflow in a healthcare setting, focusing on lab visits and tests.
