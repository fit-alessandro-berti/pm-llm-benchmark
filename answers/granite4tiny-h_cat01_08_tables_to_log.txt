Below is the **event log** that integrates data from all provided tables. Each row represents a single event, capturing the key attributes of **Case ID**, **Activity Name**, **Timestamp**, and (where available) **Resource/Actor**.

### Notes & Assumptions

1. **Case ID**: Derived directly from `order_id` as specified.
2. **Activities**: Each activity corresponds to a logical step in the business process:
   - Creation of an order (`Order Created`)
   - Picking of items for delivery (`Items Picked`) – multiple events per order if more than one item line exists
   - Dispatch and arrival of deliveries (`Order Dispatched`, `Order Arrived`)
   - Invoice issuance (`Invoice Issued`) linked to each original order.
   - Payment receipt (`Payment Received`) associated with invoices.
3. **Timestamps**: Events are ordered chronologically based on the timestamps provided in source tables. For orders split into multiple deliveries, events for each delivery segment are listed sequentially according to dispatch and arrival dates.
4. **Resource/Actor**: The `sales_person_id` and `picker_id` were mapped to `resource_name` and `role` via the optional Resources table (where available). Billing persons (`billing_person_id`) remain as a separate attribute in the event log, represented by their role rather than name for brevity.
5. **Assumptions**: If any data fields appeared ambiguous or incomplete across tables, primary linking keys (`order_id`, `activity_type` inferred from context) were used to maintain logical coherence. Missing resource mappings (e.g., specific department names) are noted as derived via optional tables where possible.

This log provides a comprehensive view of the process flow for each order instance, suitable for subsequent analysis using process mining techniques.
