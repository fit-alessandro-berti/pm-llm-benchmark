**Compiling detailed event log table**

I'm organizing a comprehensive event log across multiple order cases, carefully including order creation, item picking, deliveries, invoices, and payments. I’m designing a Markdown table with clear columns for case ID, activity, timestamps, resource info, related entities, and detailed notes, also making assumptions explicit where data is missing or unclear. The goal is a clean, chronological, and richly annotated event timeline for each case.**Finalizing event log presentation**

I’m preparing the final event log table with manageable width and clear multi-line details using semicolons for readability. I’ll add notes about the sorting order and assumptions made, especially regarding payment resource attribution, alongside a brief summary of the 34 compiled events.

### Notes & Assumptions
- **Case Identifier:** `order_id` is used as the process case ID. Events are ordered chronologically per case.
- **Activities:** Derived from core lifecycle stages—order creation, item picking, delivery dispatch/arrival, invoicing, and payment receipt.
- **Resources:** Mapped via the provided resource table when available. For payments, the responsible actor is assumed to be the customer (customer ID used as resource) because no internal resource was given.
- **Details Column:** Captures context such as item quantities/descriptions, delivery notes, and financial information to aid process analysis.
- **Missing Events:** Orders without subsequent deliveries/invoices/payments (e.g., Order 1004) reflect the current state based on available data.
