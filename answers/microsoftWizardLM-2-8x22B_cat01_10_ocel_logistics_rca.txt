 To identify the root causes for the performance issues in the process, we need to analyze the provided directly follows graph (DFG) for each object type and look for patterns or anomalies that indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Here are some process and data-specific considerations based on the given DFGs:

1. **Long durations between events:**
   - The duration between "package delivered" and "pay order" for items (452919.25 milliseconds) and between "package delivered" and "payment reminder" for items (1127921.43 milliseconds) are particularly long. This suggests that there is a significant delay in payment processing after delivery, which could be a major bottleneck.
   - The duration between "package delivered" and "send package" for employees (167138.58 milliseconds) and packages (68577.23 milliseconds) is also quite long, indicating a delay in the loop of sending new packages after delivery, which could be impacting the efficiency of the process.

2. **High frequency of certain transitions:**
   - The transition "pick item" -> "create package" for items occurs very frequently (5290 times) with a significant total duration (179085.13 milliseconds), suggesting that the time taken to pick an item and then create a package is a critical part of the process that could be optimized.
   - The transition "confirm order" -> "pay order" for items (632 events, 232738.21 milliseconds) and orders (1557 events, 528039.95 milliseconds) also indicates a high volume of orders waiting for payment, which could be a bottleneck.

3. **Repetitive or unnecessary transitions:**
   - The transition "pick item" -> "pick item" for employees (4545 times) with a relatively long total duration (17545.19 milliseconds) suggests that there might be inefficiencies or unnecessary repetitions in the item picking process.
   - The transition "confirm order" -> "confirm order" for employees (1995 times, 76944.10 milliseconds) could indicate a loop in the confirmation process that might not
