This task requires aggregating granular manufacturing events based on their operational purpose, resource type, and temporal sequence.

Based on the provided event log, we can define five distinct high-level process steps for the manufacturing workflow.

## Proposed High-Level Process Steps

| Step ID | High-Level Activity Name | Low-Level Activities Included | Rationale for Grouping |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Material Preparation & Staging** | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet | These events encompass all actions required to retrieve the raw component, verify its identity (scanning), position it correctly, and prepare it (preheating) to meet the necessary conditions for the subsequent assembly stage. They are all prerequisites for fabrication. |
| **2** | **Welding Assembly** | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B | This group represents the core value-add assembly activity. It includes the preparation specific to the welding task (picking up the tool) and the execution of the primary joining process (welding). The events are tightly linked temporally and share the same primary resource type (Operator B/Welding Tool). |
| **3** | **Inline Integrity Check** | Measure weld integrity | This event is a critical, immediate Quality Assurance step performed by an automated sensor specifically to verify the outcome of the preceding assembly (Welding Assembly). It is isolated as an inspection point directly following fabrication. |
| **4** | **Surface Finishing & Curing** | Apply protective coating, Dry coating | This stage involves post-assembly processing focused on surface treatment. It uses specialized chemical/heating resources (Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2) and is designed to complete the physical product structure before final inspection. |
| **5** | **Final Quality Gate** | Visual check | This single event represents the final, manual sign-off by a different operator (Operator C). It serves as the definitive concluding verification before the product is moved to the next phase (e.g., packaging or shipping), marking the successful end of the defined workflow. |

## Detailed Mapping of Events to High-Level Steps (Case A1 Example)

This demonstrates how the sequence of low-level events maps directly onto the proposed high-level steps:
