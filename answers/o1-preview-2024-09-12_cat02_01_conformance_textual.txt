**Answer:**

1. **Cases that violate the normative process:** Cases **2**, **3**, and **5**.

2. **Explanation of Violations:**

   - **Case 2:**
     
     - **Sequence of Activities:** Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items**  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
     
     - **Violation:** In this case, the "Package items" activity occurs **before** "Authorize payment". According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should occur **after** "Check inventory" and **before** "Package items". The constraint explicitly states that items must not be prepared for shipment until after the customer's payment method has been validated and approved. Packaging items before payment authorization risks preparing goods without ensuring that payment will be received, which is against the intended process flow.

   - **Case 3:**
     
     - **Sequence of Activities:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order**  **Ship order**  Close order
     
     - **Violation:** Here, the "Ship order" activity occurs **after** "Cancel order". The normative process specifies that once an order is canceled, it is illogical and procedurally incorrect to continue with fulfillment activities such as shipping. The constraint clearly states that "Ship order" should **never** occur after a cancellation. Shipping items for a canceled order contradicts the purpose of cancellation and could lead to unnecessary costs and customer confusion.

   - **Case 5:**
     
     - **Sequence of Activities:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order
     
     - **Violation:** In this scenario, the "Package items" activity is **missing** before "Ship order". The normative process dictates that "Package items" must occur **after** "Authorize payment" and **before** "Ship order". The logical sequence requires that items be properly prepared and packaged prior to shipping to ensure that the products reach the customer in good condition. Skipping the packaging step violates the process expectation that preparation is a necessary precursor to shipping.

**Summary:**

- **Case 2** violates the sequence by **packaging items before payment authorization**.
- **Case 3** violates the process by **shipping an order after it has been canceled**.
- **Case 5** violates the expected flow by **omitting the "Package items" activity before shipping**.

These deviations from the normative process represent breaches of key constraints outlined in the process description, undermining the logical and procedural integrity of the order handling system.
