**1. Identification of Cases Violating Normative Rules:**

**Case 1:**
- **Compliance:** Case 1 follows the normative sequence correctly.
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **No Violations:** All steps are in the correct order, and the documentation is finalized only after approval.

**Case 2:**
- **Violations:**
  - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** The Risk Assessment occurred before the Credit Check, which violates the required sequence. The correct order should be Credit Check before Risk Assessment.
  - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** Finalizing documentation after a rejection is not allowed according to the normative rules.
- **Explanation:** The process skipped the Credit Check before the Risk Assessment and incorrectly finalized documentation after a rejection, both of which are serious violations of the normative constraints.

**Case 3:**
- **Compliance:** Case 3 follows the normative sequence correctly.
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **No Violations:** All steps are in the correct order, and the documentation is finalized only after approval.

**Summary of Normative Violations:**
- **Case 2** is the only case that violates the normative rules due to the incorrect order of Credit Check and Risk Assessment and the unauthorized finalization of documentation after rejection.

**2. Identification of Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions:**

**Case 1:**
- **Compliance:** Case 1 meets all desiderata conditions.
  - **Credit Check within 24 hours:** Credit Check was completed within 30 minutes of receiving the application.
  - **Inform Applicant within 48 hours:** The applicant was informed within 2 hours of the loan decision.
  - **Follow-up Call:** There is no record of a Follow-up Call, but this is not a strict requirement.

**Case 2:**
- **Violations:**
  - **Credit Check within 24 hours:** Credit Check was completed within 1 hour and 10 minutes of receiving the application, but this does not matter due to the normative violation.
  - **Inform Applicant within 48 hours:** The applicant was informed within 30 minutes of the loan decision.
  - **Follow-up Call:** There is no record of a Follow-up Call, but this is not a strict requirement.
- **Explanation:** Although Case 2 meets the timing desiderata, it is overshadowed by the normative violations.

**Case 3:**
- **Violations:**
  - **Credit Check within 24 hours:** Credit Check was completed more than 48 hours after receiving the application, which violates the recommended timing.
  - **Inform Applicant within 48 hours:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision, which violates the recommended timing.
  - **Follow-up Call:** There is no record of a Follow-up Call, but this is not a strict requirement.
- **Explanation:** Case 3 fails to meet the timing desiderata for Credit Check and informing the applicant, but these are not severe violations.

**Summary of Desiderata Violations:**
- **Case 3** fails to meet the recommended timing for Credit Check and informing the applicant. While these are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior.
- **Case 2** technically meets the timing desiderata but is irrelevant due to the normative violations.

**3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors:**

**Case 1:**
- **Justification:** Case 1 follows the normative rules and meets the desiderata, suggesting a well-managed process. The absence of a Follow-up Call is not a violation, but it could enhance customer satisfaction if implemented.

**Case 2:**
- **Interpretation:** The violation of performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check might be due to a misunderstanding or oversight by the staff. The finalization of documentation after rejection could be an error in the process or a lack of training on the correct procedure.
- **Justification:** There is no valid justification for these violations. They represent clear errors in process adherence that need to be addressed through training and process enforcement.

**Case 3:**
- **Interpretation:** The delay in Credit Check and informing the applicant could be due to operational delays or high workload.
- **Justification:** While these delays violate the desiderata, they might be justified by external factors such as staffing shortages or system issues. The absence of a Follow-up Call, though not required, could be improved to enhance customer experience.

In conclusion, while **Case 2** requires immediate attention due to normative violations, **Case 3** could benefit from process improvements to better meet the recommended timing and enhance customer satisfaction through optional Follow-up Calls.
