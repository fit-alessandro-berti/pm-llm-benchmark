To identify the main differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, let's analyze the process variants and their execution times. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

### 1. **Initial Registration and Pre-Expert Examination Processes:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The protected group starts with either "Register at ER" or "Register at FD" followed by standard examinations and treatments.
  - Some protected group variants skip initial comprehensive examinations ("Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination") and proceed directly to diagnosis and treatment.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The unprotected group predominantly starts with "Register at FD" followed by expert examinations and thorough examinations.
  - There are fewer direct registrations without a thorough examination.

### 2. **Type of Examinations and Diagnoses:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Variants with "Thorough Examination" are less common and often follow combinations of "Register at ER" or "ER -> Expert Examination".
  - There is a mix of standard examinations and thorough ones.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination" are very common, especially with "FD -> Expert Examination".

### 3. **Treatment Outcomes and Success Rates:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Execute higher numbers of variants that end without treatment success (e.g., "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful" ending in multiple steps).
  - More variants with high execution times, especially those involving multiple unsuccessful and successful treatment stages.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Mostly straightforward variants leading to successful treatment.
  - Fewer composite treatment unsuccessful to successful routes, suggesting a more uniform success rate.

### 4. **Execution Times:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Execution times are highly variable, ranging from very short (e.g., 0.000) to very long (e.g., 480,000+).
  - Variants with high frequencies often involve longer execution times.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Execution times are generally shorter and more consistent.
  - Processes with high frequencies have more moderate execution times (e.g., 260,000 - 320,000).

### 5. **Discharge Processes:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Complicated sequences like "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" are more common.
  - Multiple-step discharges with average and longer execution times.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Direct and simple discharge sequences are frequent.
  - Discharge processes are more straightforward and generally have shorter execution times.

### Conclusion:
- **Protected Group:** This group has a broader range of process variants, including longer and more complicated treatment paths. They often involve multiple steps and queries (e.g., thorough examinations, multiple unsuccessful cycles before success).
- **Unprotected Group:** This group tends to follow more straightforward and efficient processes, with less variation and fewer complex treatment paths.

These differences suggest that the treatment process for the protected group is more exploratory and less predictable, with higher variability in both treatment outcomes and execution times. The unprotected group follows more standardized and efficient processes, likely leading to more consistent and faster outcomes.
