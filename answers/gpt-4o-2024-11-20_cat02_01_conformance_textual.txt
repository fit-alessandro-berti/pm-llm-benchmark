Let's analyze the event log cases one by one in light of the **Normative Process Description** and identify any deviations from the expected flow and rules. We'll break down the sequence of events for each case and assess whether it adheres to the normative process. 

---

### **Case 1**

| **Timestamp** | **Activity**          |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 2023-10-05 09:00 | Receive order       |
| 2023-10-05 10:00 | Check inventory     |
| 2023-10-05 11:00 | Authorize payment   |
| 2023-10-05 12:00 | Package items       |
| 2023-10-05 13:00 | Ship order          |
| 2023-10-05 14:00 | Close order         |

**Analysis:**  
- The sequence in Case 1 matches the normative process for sufficient inventory:
  1. "Check inventory" occurs directly after "Receive order."
  2. "Authorize payment" occurs after "Check inventory" (payment is only authorized when inventory sufficiency is confirmed).
  3. "Package items" follows payment authorization.
  4. "Ship order" occurs after packaging.
  5. "Close order" is the final activity as it should be.  

**Conclusion:** Case 1 adheres to the normative process.  
**No violations detected.**

### **Case 2**

| **Timestamp** | **Activity**          |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 2023-10-06 09:00 | Receive order       |
| 2023-10-06 09:30 | Check inventory     |
| 2023-10-06 10:00 | Package items       |
| 2023-10-06 10:30 | Authorize payment   |
| 2023-10-06 11:00 | Ship order          |
| 2023-10-06 11:30 | Close order         |

**Analysis:**  
- "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment," which violates the normative rule that packaging must follow payment authorization.  
- While the subsequent steps proceed correctly (packaging -> shipping -> closing), this incorrect sequence indicates a process deviation.

**Conclusion:** Case 2 violates the normative process because **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."**

### **Case 3**

| **Timestamp** | **Activity**          |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 2023-10-07 09:00 | Receive order       |
| 2023-10-07 09:20 | Check inventory     |
| 2023-10-07 09:40 | Authorize payment   |
| 2023-10-07 10:00 | Cancel order        |
| 2023-10-07 10:30 | Ship order          |
| 2023-10-07 11:00 | Close order         |

**Analysis:**  
- "Authorize payment" occurs despite the fact that the order is later canceled. The normative description implies that payment authorization should only occur when the inventory check confirms sufficiency (i.e., a fulfillment scenario), and it makes no sense to authorize payment for an order that will be canceled.  
- More importantly, "Ship order" occurs **after the order is canceled**, which directly violates the normative condition that no activities intended for fulfillment (e.g., shipping) should occur following "Cancel order."  

**Conclusion:** Case 3 violates the normative process due to the following violations:
1. **"Authorize payment" occurs despite the subsequent cancellation.**
2. **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."**

### **Case 4**

| **Timestamp** | **Activity**          |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 2023-10-08 09:00 | Receive order       |
| 2023-10-08 09:10 | Check inventory     |
| 2023-10-08 09:20 | Cancel order        |
| 2023-10-08 09:50 | Close order         |

**Analysis:**  
- This case follows the expected sequence for insufficient inventory:
  1. "Receive order" -> "Check inventory."
  2. After determining inventory insufficiency, the order is canceled with "Cancel order."
  3. "Close order" is the final activity, and no fulfillment-related activities (packaging, shipping, etc.) occur after cancellation.

**Conclusion:** Case 4 adheres to the normative process.  
**No violations detected.**

### **Case 5**

| **Timestamp** | **Activity**          |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 2023-10-09 09:00 | Receive order       |
| 2023-10-09 10:00 | Check inventory     |
| 2023-10-09 10:30 | Authorize payment   |
| 2023-10-09 11:00 | Ship order          |
| 2023-10-09 11:30 | Close order         |

**Analysis:**  
- "Ship order" occurs **before** "Package items." According to the normative rules, packaging must occur prior to shipment as items must be prepared before they can be shipped.  
- All other activities are correctly sequenced, but this one deviation is significant enough to make the process non-compliant.

**Conclusion:** Case 5 violates the normative process because **"Ship order" occurs before "Package items."**

### **Summary of Deviations**

| **Case ID** | **Violation(s)**                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2           | "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," violating the normative rule that packaging follows payment authorization.                          |
| 3           | 1. "Authorize payment" occurs despite the order being canceled.                                                                                       |
|             | 2. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," violating the rule that no fulfillment activities should follow cancellation.                             |
| 5           | "Ship order" occurs before "Package items," violating the rule that packaging must precede shipping.                                                   |

**Cases 1 and 4 adhere to the normative process.**
