Let's analyze each case from the event log against the normative process description:

### Case 1:
- **Sequence:** Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order
- **Analysis:** This case follows the expected sequence for when inventory is sufficient. **No violation**.

### Case 2:
- **Sequence:** Receive order, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order
- **Violation:** 
  - **Package items** occurs before **Authorize payment**. According to the normative process, payment must be authorized before packaging can begin. This suggests that items were prepared for shipment before payment was confirmed, which could lead to issues if payment fails.

### Case 3:
- **Sequence:** Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order
- **Violations:** 
  - **Authorize payment** occurs before **Cancel order**. Payment should not be authorized if the inventory check indicates insufficient stock, leading directly to cancellation.
  - **Ship order** after **Cancel order**. It is illogical to ship an order that has been canceled.

### Case 4:
- **Sequence:** Receive order, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order
- **Analysis:** This case follows the expected sequence for when inventory is insufficient. **No violation**.

### Case 5:
- **Sequence:** Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order
- **Violation:** 
  - **Ship order** occurs without **Package items** beforehand. The items must be prepared (packaged) before they can be shipped. This step is missing, which violates the requirement that "Package items" must precede "Ship order."

### Summary of Violations:

- **Case 2**: 
  - Packaging items before authorizing payment.
  
- **Case 3**: 
  - Authorizing payment after inventory check indicates insufficient stock.
  - Shipping a canceled order.

- **Case 5**: 
  - Shipping without packaging items first.

### Explanation:

- **Case 2** shows a deviation where packaging occurs before payment authorization. This could result in wasted resources if the payment fails after packaging, as the items would already be prepared for shipping.

- **Case 3** is problematic in multiple ways:
  - Authorizing payment when inventory is insufficient suggests a system error or miscommunication, where payment processing happens despite the inability to fulfill the order.
  - Shipping after cancellation directly contradicts the purpose of cancellation, indicating either a process error or a failure to communicate cancellation effectively.

- **Case 5** misses an essential step. By not packaging the items, the process skips a critical control point where the items would be verified and prepared for shipment, potentially leading to damaged or incorrect shipments.

These violations highlight potential issues in process management, system integration, or employee training where the sequence of operations does not follow the intended flow, potentially leading to customer dissatisfaction, financial losses, or operational inefficiencies.
