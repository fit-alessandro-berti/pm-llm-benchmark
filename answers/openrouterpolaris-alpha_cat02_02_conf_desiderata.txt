Great scenario. Let’s go case by case, clearly separating strict (normative) violations from soft (desiderata) ones.

1. Normative rule compliance

Case 1

Trace:
- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case

Check against strict rules:
- Correct start (Application Received) 
- Credit Check before Risk Assessment 
- Risk Assessment before Loan Decision 
- Inform Applicant after Loan Decision 
- Approved  Finalize Documentation before Close Case 
- No contradictory actions 
- No steps skipped in the required sequence 

Conclusion: 
- Case 1 complies fully with the normative rules (no strict violations).

Case 2

Trace:
- Application Received
- Risk Assessment
- Credit Check
- Loan Decision (Rejected)
- Finalize Documentation
- Close Case

Normative checks:
- Risk Assessment before Credit Check 
  - Violates: “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.”
- Finalize Documentation after rejection 
  - Violates: “If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.”
- Decision-closure logic 
  - Required: Rejected  Close Case WITHOUT Finalize Documentation.
  - Actual: Rejected  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.

Conclusion:
- Case 2 violates several strict normative constraints and is non-compliant.

Case 3

Trace:
- Application Received
- Credit Check
- Risk Assessment
- Loan Decision (Approved)
- Inform Applicant
- Finalize Documentation
- Close Case

Normative checks:
- Correct order of all mandatory steps 
- Credit Check before Risk Assessment 
- Risk Assessment before Loan Decision 
- Inform Applicant after Loan Decision 
- Approved  Finalize Documentation before Close Case 
- No prohibited actions (no finalization after rejection, etc.) 

Note: Absence of “Follow-up Call” is NOT a strict requirement.

Conclusion:
- Case 3 complies with all normative rules (no strict violations).


2. Desiderata (soft) deviations

Desiderata given:
- Credit Check ideally within 24 hours of Application Received.
- Inform Applicant ideally within 48 hours of Loan Decision.
- Follow-up Call before Close Case is recommended (not required).

Case 1 (Desiderata)

- Application  Credit Check: 30 minutes  (within 24h)
- Loan Decision  Inform Applicant: 2 hours  (within 48h)
- Follow-up Call: Not recorded (neutral; just a missed recommendation if intended)

Desiderata conclusion:
- Case 1 fully aligns with timing recommendations.
- If we assume follow-up is recommended for all: mild deviation for no follow-up, but not problematic.

Case 2 (Desiderata)

Even though it already breaks strict rules, we can still note:
- Application  Risk Assessment: very quick.
- Application  Credit Check: 1 hour (within 24h) 
- Loan Decision  Inform Applicant: Not explicitly listed as a separate activity (the log skips straight to Finalize Documentation).
  - If we interpret “Inform Applicant” as missing: that would be a normative defect (if strictly required as a distinct step). In your table, though, the main flagged issues are order/finalization; we keep this aligned with your stated constraints.
- Follow-up Call: Not present (at most a soft deviation).

Desiderata conclusion:
- On timing: No clear timing-based desiderata issues.
- On recommendations like follow-up: could be seen as suboptimal but overshadowed by strict violations.

Case 3 (Desiderata)

- Application (2024-01-12 09:00)  Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00):
  - About 49 hours later  (exceeds 24h recommendation).
- Loan Decision (2024-01-14 12:00)  Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00):
  - About 51 hours later  (exceeds 48h recommendation).
- Follow-up Call:
  - Missing  relative to recommendation.

Desiderata conclusion:
- Case 3 shows multiple soft deviations:
  - Late credit check.
  - Late customer notification.
  - No follow-up call.
- These are explicitly “not serious” but indicate suboptimal performance.


3. Interpretations and possible justifications

For compliant or near-compliant behavior:

- Case 1:
  - Represents the ideal reference behavior:
    - Strict order followed.
    - Quick credit check and prompt communication.
    - Proper documentation before closing.
  - This is a good template trace for conformance and efficiency.

For strict violations (Case 2):

- Risk Assessment before Credit Check:
  - Possible (but non-conforming) operational explanation:
    - An analyst started a preliminary risk assessment with incomplete data.
    - A system or training issue allowed starting Risk Assessment without enforcing prior Credit Check.
  - Regardless of intent, it contradicts the mandated control flow and should be treated as a true normative violation.

- Finalize Documentation after Rejection:
  - Possible interpretations:
    - Misuse of the “Finalize Documentation” activity label to mean “record rejection note” rather than finalizing approval docs.
    - Staff confusion or process design flaw.
  - Under the stated semantics, however, this is not allowed:
    - After rejection, the case should be closed without the approval-style documentation step.

For desiderata deviations (Case 3):

- Late Credit Check:
  - Possible explanations:
    - Queue backlog, missing information from applicant, technical issues, or manual review.
  - This is a performance/service-quality issue, not a compliance breach.

- Late Inform Applicant:
  - Possible explanations:
    - Difficulty contacting customer.
    - Internal review/verification to ensure decision quality.
    - Resource constraints.
  - Again, it reduces customer experience and responsiveness but stays within the allowed behavior.

- Missing Follow-up Call:
  - Explanation:
    - Treated as optional; may be skipped for straightforward approved cases.
  - Its absence aligns with the definition of desiderata: acceptable but not ideal.

Summary:

- Normative violations:
  - Only Case 2 violates strict rules (wrong ordering, improper finalization after rejection).
  - Cases 1 and 3 are fully compliant with the hard constraints.
- Desiderata (soft) deviations:
  - Case 1: Essentially none (possibly no follow-up call, which is acceptable).
  - Case 2: Potentially missing recommended behaviors, but overshadowed by strict violations.
  - Case 3: Clear soft deviations on timing and no follow-up call—suboptimal but not non-compliant.

If you’d like, I can next:
- Formalize these constraints (e.g., in temporal logic or Declare constraints).
- Provide an automated-style conformance checking summary suitable for tooling.
