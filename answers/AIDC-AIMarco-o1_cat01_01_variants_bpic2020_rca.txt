Alright, I need to analyze the given process variants to identify the root causes of performance issues. The data provided includes various paths that a Declaration can take through the process, along with their frequencies and associated performance metrics. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll categorize the process paths based on the approvals and rejections involved. There are several roles involved: EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, and PRE_APPROVER. The process flow typically starts with an EMPLOYEE submitting a Declaration, followed by various approval stages, and finally moving to payment handling.

Looking at the frequencies, some paths are more common than others. For example, the path involving BUDGET OWNER approval appears less frequently compared to paths without it. This might indicate that involving additional approval stages can slow down the process.

Now, focusing on the performance metrics, higher performance values generally correspond to higher frequencies. However, some paths with lower frequencies have surprisingly high performance metrics. For instance, the path that includes multiple rejections and resubmissions seems to have high performance values, which might be a red flag. It's possible that these high performance figures are due to the complexity or the number of steps involved, which could lead to inefficiencies.

Another observation is the presence of "DECLARATION REJECTED" steps. These rejections can significantly impact the overall performance if they lead to delays or require additional processing steps, such as resubmissions or escalations. The frequency of these rejections varies across paths, with some paths having more rejections than others.

Additionally, there's a path where the Declaration is REJECTED by MISSING. This could imply that certain prerequisites or missing information are required for the process to proceed, and their absence can halt the workflow, affecting performance negatively.

I should also consider the role of PRE_APPROVER in some paths. The involvement of PRE_APPROVER seems to be a common factor in several paths, and its presence affects the performance metrics. It's possible that PRE_APPROVER's role introduces additional complexity or requires more time to process, thereby impacting the overall performance.

Moreover, the "DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" path has varying frequencies and performance metrics. Some submissions are handled promptly, while others lead to multiple rejections and resubmissions, which can elongate the process duration.

It's also interesting to note that the payment handling step, which is the final stage, has a frequency of 4618 with a performance metric of 810187.903. This suggests that the payment handling process itself is efficient, but the lead-up to it is where the performance issues might be stemming from.

Another pattern I observe is the variability in performance metrics across different paths. Some paths with similar structures have significantly different performance values, indicating that certain decision points or roles have a disproportionate impact on the process's efficiency.

Perhaps the involvement of SUPERVISOR in multiple approval steps introduces a bottleneck, as they are a key decision point in the process. If SUPERVISOR is frequently rejecting or approving Declarations, this could lead to delays and increased performance metrics due to the need for further processing.

Furthermore, the presence of multiple rejection points, especially those leading to resubmissions, can disrupt the flow of the process. Each rejection and subsequent resubmission adds to the total time and resources required, thereby negatively impacting performance.

In summary, the root causes of performance issues in the process likely stem from:

1. **Multiple Rejection Points**: Frequent rejections, especially those leading to resubmissions, can slow down the process.
2. **Involvement of Additional Approval Roles**: The presence of roles like BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, and SUPERVISOR introduces complexity and potential bottlenecks.
3. **Process Variations Leading to Higher Frequencies**: Paths with more steps or additional approval stages have higher frequencies but often lower performance metrics, suggesting inefficiencies.
4. **Handling of Missing Information**: Rejections due to missing information can halt the process, affecting overall performance.
5. **Decision Points with High Impact**: Roles like SUPERVISOR, whose decisions significantly influence the process flow, can become critical points of delay if not managed efficiently.

Addressing these areas could help in optimizing the process and improving overall performance.
