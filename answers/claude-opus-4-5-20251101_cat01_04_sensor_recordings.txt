# Process Mining Analysis: Manufacturing Assembly Line Event Log

## Overview

After analyzing the sensor readings across all 15 events, I've identified **5 distinct activity phases** based on characteristic patterns in temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption.

## Identified Activities and Event Groupings

### **Activity 1: Idle/Standby Mode**
**Events: 1-3 and 13-15**

| Metric | Values |
|--------|--------|
| Temperature | 20-21°C (ambient) |
| Pressure | 1 bar (baseline) |
| Vibration | 0 Hz |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s |
| Tool Position | 0 mm |
| Energy | 0.40-0.50 kWh (minimal) |

**Rationale:** 
- All readings are at baseline/ambient levels
- No material movement, no tool engagement, no vibration
- Minimal energy consumption indicates only standby power
- This represents the machine in an idle state, either at the **start of a production cycle** (Events 1-3) or **end of cycle** (Events 13-15)

### **Activity 2: Cutting Metal**
**Events: 4-6**

| Metric | Values |
|--------|--------|
| Temperature | 50-58°C (rising rapidly) |
| Pressure | 1-1.5 bar (slight increase) |
| Vibration | 30-38 Hz (high) |
| Material Flow | 5 units/s (consistent) |
| Tool Position | 5710 mm (advancing) |
| Energy | 2.00-3.00 kWh (high) |

**Rationale:**
- **High vibration (30-38 Hz)** is characteristic of cutting/machining operations where tools interact with hard materials
- **Rapidly increasing temperature** suggests friction from metal cutting
- **Steady material flow (5 units/s)** indicates continuous feeding of raw material
- **Progressive tool position movement** shows the cutting tool advancing through material
- **High energy consumption** reflects the power needed for cutting operations
- The combination of these factors strongly indicates a **cutting or machining operation**

### **Activity 3: Assembling Parts**
**Events: 7-8**

| Metric | Values |
|--------|--------|
| Temperature | 40°C (moderate, stable) |
| Pressure | 2 bar (elevated) |
| Vibration | 10 Hz (low) |
| Material Flow | 2 units/s (reduced) |
| Tool Position | 15 mm (fixed) |
| Energy | 2.00 kWh (moderate) |

**Rationale:**
- **Elevated, stable pressure (2 bar)** suggests parts being pressed or held together
- **Low vibration (10 Hz)** indicates controlled, precise movements rather than aggressive machining
- **Reduced material flow (2 units/s)** suggests components being positioned rather than continuous processing
- **Fixed tool position** indicates holding/positioning rather than cutting
- **Stable readings across both events** suggest a controlled assembly operation
- The consistency and moderate conditions indicate **mechanical assembly or part positioning**

### **Activity 4: Welding**
**Event: 9**

| Metric | Values |
|--------|--------|
| Temperature | 80°C (peak/highest) |
| Pressure | 2 bar |
| Vibration | 50 Hz (highest) |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s |
| Tool Position | 15 mm (same as assembly) |
| Energy | 5.00 kWh (maximum) |

**Rationale:**
- **Peak temperature (80°C)** is the highest in the entire log, consistent with heat-generating welding
- **Maximum vibration (50 Hz)** reflects the intense energy transfer during welding
- **Zero material flow** indicates no new material being fed—only joining existing parts
- **Tool position unchanged from assembly** suggests welding at the assembled joint
- **Maximum energy consumption (5.00 kWh)** is characteristic of welding's high power demands
- The brief, intense nature (single event) matches **spot welding or tack welding operations**

### **Activity 5: Quality Inspection / Packaging**
**Events: 10-12**

| Metric | Values |
|--------|--------|
| Temperature | 25-30°C (cooling down) |
| Pressure | 1 bar (baseline) |
| Vibration | 1-5 Hz (minimal) |
| Material Flow | 0-1 units/s (minimal) |
| Tool Position | 1520 mm (slight movement) |
| Energy | 1.00-1.60 kWh (low) |

**Rationale:**
- **Decreasing temperature** indicates post-welding cool-down period
- **Minimal vibration** suggests gentle handling rather than processing
- **Low material flow** could represent finished product movement
- **Slight tool position change (1520 mm)** may indicate repositioning for inspection or packaging
- **Low energy consumption** is consistent with non-intensive operations
- Event 10 shows rapid cooling (30°C) which could be **active cooling or inspection**
- Events 11-12 show stable, low readings consistent with **final inspection or packaging preparation**

## Key Insights

1. **Complete production cycle captured**: The log shows one full manufacturing cycle from idle  production  idle
2. **Logical process sequence**: The activities follow a realistic manufacturing workflow (cut  assemble  weld  inspect  package)
3. **Clear sensor signatures**: Each activity has distinctive sensor patterns that enable reliable classification
4. **Cycle time**: Approximately 1 minute for one complete production cycle
