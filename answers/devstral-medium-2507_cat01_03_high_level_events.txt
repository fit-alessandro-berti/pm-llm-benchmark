### High-Level Process Steps

Based on the provided event log, we can identify several high-level process steps that represent coherent stages of the manufacturing process. Here are the proposed high-level activities:

1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Assembly**
3. **Quality Inspection**
4. **Finishing**

### Justification for Groupings

#### 1. Material Preparation
- **Events Included:**
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet
  - Scan barcode
  - Place metal sheet on table
  - Align metal sheet
  - Preheat metal sheet

- **Rationale:**
  These events are all related to the initial setup and preparation of the raw material. They involve retrieving the material, verifying its identity, positioning it correctly, and preparing it for further processing. These steps are logically grouped together as they all contribute to getting the material ready for the next phase.

#### 2. Assembly
- **Events Included:**
  - Pick up welding tool
  - Weld corner A
  - Weld corner B

- **Rationale:**
  These events are all part of the assembly process where the actual construction or joining of parts takes place. Picking up the welding tool is a preparatory step for the welding activities that follow. The welding actions are directly related to assembling the product.

#### 3. Quality Inspection
- **Events Included:**
  - Measure weld integrity
  - Visual check

- **Rationale:**
  These events are quality assurance steps that ensure the product meets the required standards. Measuring weld integrity and performing a visual check are both inspections that verify the quality of the assembly work done in the previous step.

#### 4. Finishing
- **Events Included:**
  - Apply protective coating
  - Dry coating

- **Rationale:**
  These events are related to the final treatment of the product to protect it and prepare it for use or further processing. Applying a protective coating and drying it are both finishing steps that ensure the product is durable and ready for the next stage.

### Summary

By grouping the low-level events into these high-level process steps, we can better understand the manufacturing workflow. Each high-level step represents a coherent stage of the process, making it easier to analyze and optimize the manufacturing process.
