Based on the interview transcripts, here is a BPMN-like textual process model for the Invoice Approval Process:

## Invoice Approval Process Model

### Process Participants (Swim Lanes):
- **Supplier** (External)
- **Accounts Payable Clerk** (Primary: Mary)
- **Purchasing Officer** (Primary: Dan)
- **Department Manager** (Primary: Carlos)
- **AP Supervisor** (Primary: Rita)
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Primary: Karen)
- **Accounting System** (Automated)

### Process Flow:

**START EVENT:** Invoice Received (typically via email)

**TASK 1:** [Accounts Payable Clerk] Check for Purchase Order Number
- Input: Invoice from supplier
- Output: Validation status

**GATEWAY 1 (Exclusive):** Does invoice contain valid PO number?
- **NO Path:** 
  - **TASK 1a:** [Accounts Payable Clerk] Request PO details from supplier
  - Flow returns to supplier, then back to TASK 1 when corrected invoice received
- **YES Path:** Continue to TASK 2

**TASK 2:** [Accounts Payable Clerk] Log invoice in accounting system
- Input: Invoice with valid PO
- Output: System record created

**TASK 3:** [Accounts Payable Clerk] Forward invoice to Purchasing Department
- Output: Email notification to Purchasing Officer

**TASK 4:** [Purchasing Officer] Verify receipt of goods/services and compare invoice details
- Input: Invoice, Purchase Order
- Activities: Check quantities, prices, delivery charges against PO

**GATEWAY 2 (Exclusive):** Do invoice details match PO and receipt?
- **YES Path:** 
  - **TASK 4a:** [Purchasing Officer] Send confirmation to Accounts Payable
  - Continue to TASK 6
- **NO Path (Minor Discrepancy):**
  - **TASK 4b:** [Purchasing Officer/AP Clerk] Contact supplier for correction
  - **SUB-PROCESS:** May involve Supplier Relationship Manager for resolution
  - Flow returns to TASK 4 when corrected invoice received
- **NO Path (Major/Unresolvable Discrepancy):**
  - Continue to GATEWAY 3

**GATEWAY 3 (Exclusive):** Can discrepancy be resolved at current level?
- **NO Path:**
  - **TASK 5:** [Accounts Payable Clerk] Escalate to AP Supervisor
  - **TASK 5a:** [AP Supervisor] Investigate and resolve exception
    - May create retrospective PO for informal services
    - May coordinate with Supplier Relationship Manager
    - May reject invoice
  - After resolution, return to appropriate point in flow (TASK 4 or TASK 6)
- **YES Path:** Return to main flow

**TASK 6:** [Accounts Payable Clerk] Match invoice line items against PO in system
- Precondition: Receipt confirmed by Purchasing

**TASK 7:** [Accounting System] Send approval request to Department Manager
- Automated email notification triggered

**TASK 8:** [Department Manager] Review invoice details
- Input: Invoice, PO, confirmation from Purchasing
- Review: Quantities, pricing, budget alignment

**GATEWAY 4 (Exclusive):** Does Manager approve?
- **YES Path:**
  - **TASK 8a:** [Department Manager] Approve invoice in system
  - Continue to TASK 9
- **NO Path:**
  - **TASK 8b:** [Department Manager] Reject or request investigation
  - Flow may return to TASK 5 (escalation) or TASK 4b (supplier contact)

**TASK 9:** [Accounts Payable Clerk] Schedule invoice for payment
- Input: Approved invoice
- Output: Invoice added to payment cycle

**END EVENT:** Invoice scheduled for payment

### Key Business Rules:
1. No invoice processing without valid PO number (except rare cases handled by AP Supervisor)
2. Purchasing confirmation required before manager approval
3. Manager approval required for all invoices after matching
4. Discrepancies must be resolved before proceeding to approval

### Exception Handling Notes:
- Missing PO scenarios may involve Supplier Relationship Manager intervention
- Retrospective POs can be created by AP Supervisor for informal service contracts
- Escalation path exists for complex discrepancies that cannot be resolved at clerk level
- Supplier corrections may be requested at multiple points in the process

### Data Objects:
- Invoice (moves through entire process)
- Purchase Order (reference document)
- Confirmation emails
- System notifications
- Payment schedule

This model represents the standard flow with common variations as described by the interviewees. Some ambiguity exists around the exact escalation criteria and the frequency of informal service invoices without POs.
