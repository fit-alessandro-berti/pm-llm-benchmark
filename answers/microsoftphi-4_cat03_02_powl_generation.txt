To construct the POWL model for the specified scenario of a digital service provisioning process, we need to represent each step using the appropriate `pm4py` classes. The process involves sequential execution, concurrency, looping for debugging, and exclusive choices which can be modeled using POWL constructs.

Below is the Python code that synthesizes the entire scenario into a POWL model:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define each step as a transition
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Silent transition is used as a placeholder when no visible action occurs
skip = SilentTransition()

# Loop between BNC and optional D&R
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Exclusive choice between CD and MD
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Create the POWL model with sequential setup
root = StrictPartialOrder()
root.nodes.extend([SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop_config, deployment_choice, QA, SA, GLA])

# Define partial order (execution order constraints)
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, deployment_choice)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, QA)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, SA)
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# DA and ACI are concurrent and independent of each other
# QA and SA are concurrent and can be executed in any order once their precedence is completed

# The final POWL model for the scenario
print(root)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Transitions for Each Step:** Each phase of the process is represented as a `Transition` or `SilentTransition`. For example, the contract setup and various configuration steps are modeled as transitions with specific labels.

2. **Loop Construction:** The loop between `Base Network Configuration (BNC)` and `Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)` is captured using `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP`. This setup demonstrates that after `BNC`, the process may enter a loop, executing `D&R` if necessary, and repeat this as many times as required.

3. **Exclusive Choice:** The deployment choice between `Containerized Deployment (CD)` and `Monolithic Deployment (MD)` is modeled using `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR`.

4. **Partial Order for Execution Flow:** The `StrictPartialOrder` is used to define dependencies between tasks. For example, `Contract Setup (CS)` must be completed before `Datacenter Allocation (DA)` and `Access Control Initialization (ACI)` can begin. Similarly, the `Quality Assurance (QA)` and `Security Audit (SA)` tasks can occur concurrently but both must be completed before the `Go-Live Approval (GLA)`.

5. **Concurrency Handling:** Steps such as `DA` and `ACI` are independent and can be executed concurrently. Likewise, `QA` and `SA` can be run in parallel or in any sequence as they are not dependent on each other once the preceding tasks are completed.

This setup accurately captures the complex workflow described using POWL, showcasing the flexibility of the model in representing intricate process flows.
