 This data represents the various paths or processes that can occur when a fine is issued, starting from its creation until it is fully paid or appealed. The numbers next to each step represent their frequency (how often they happen) and performance (the total number of instances multiplied by a certain weight).

The main processes are:
1. Issuing the fine: This involves creating the fine, sending the fine to the offender, inserting the fine notification, and adding a penalty if necessary.
2. Appealing the fine within the prefecture: If an appeal is made, it can go through various steps, such as sending the appeal, receiving the result of the appeal, notifying the offender, and paying the fine after the result is received (if the appeal was denied).
3. Sending the fine for credit collection: This happens if no payment or appeal has been made after a certain period, and the fine is escalated for collection through debt agencies.
4. Appealing to a judge: If the offender disagrees with the prefecture's decision on their appeal, they can take their case to a judge for further review. This process might include paying additional fines along the way.
5. Direct payment of the fine: In some cases, the offender might pay the fine without any appeals or escalation.

The frequency and performance numbers indicate how often each step occurs in this process, with higher performance values representing a larger total count when multiplied by the frequency. For example, creating a fine is the most common step (frequency = 19), while sending the fine for credit collection after an unsuccessful appeal to a judge has the highest performance value (performance = 98982000).
