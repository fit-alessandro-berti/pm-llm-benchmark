We are given an event log for the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process. The typical sequence of activities in a standard P2P process is:
  1. Create Purchase Requisition
  2. Approve Purchase Requisition
  3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)
  4. Receive Goods
  5. Vendor Invoice Received
  6. Match Invoice to PO
  7. Release Payment
  8. Close Case

However, note that the sequence in the log might not strictly follow this order because of real-world variations. But we must identify anomalies that deviate from standard practices.

Let's analyze each case:

**Case 1001:**
  - Sequence: 
      Create Purchase Requisition -> Approve Purchase Requisition -> Issue Purchase Order -> Receive Goods -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Match Invoice to PO -> Release Payment -> Close Case
  - This is a standard sequence. The only note is that the Vendor Invoice Received comes after Receive Goods, which is acceptable because sometimes the invoice is received after the goods are delivered.

**Case 1002:**
  - Sequence:
      Create Purchase Requisition -> Issue Purchase Order -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Release Payment -> Approve Purchase Requisition -> Receive Goods -> Match Invoice to PO -> Close Case
  - Anomalies:
      - The Purchase Requisition is created, then the PO is issued without an approval. Then the invoice is received and payment is released. Then later the Purchase Requisition is approved. This is problematic because the approval should happen before issuing the PO. Issuing a PO without approval is a violation of internal controls and may lead to unauthorized purchases.
      - Also, the goods are received after the payment is released. Typically, you would receive the goods before paying (to ensure you got what you ordered). Releasing payment before receiving goods is risky because you might pay for goods you never receive.

**Case 1003:**
  - Sequence:
      Create Purchase Requisition -> Approve Purchase Requisition -> Issue Purchase Order -> Release Payment -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Receive Goods -> Match Invoice to PO -> Close Case
  - Anomalies:
      - Payment is released before the vendor invoice is received and before the goods are received. This is problematic because:
          * You should not pay before receiving the goods (unless it's a prepayment, but in standard P2P, payment is after goods receipt and invoice matching).
          * Also, the invoice matching (Match Invoice to PO) is done after the payment, which should be done before. Matching the invoice to the PO is a critical step to verify the invoice amount and terms before payment.
      - The sequence of events is:
          Issue PO -> Release Payment -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Receive Goods -> Match Invoice to PO
        This is highly problematic because:
          * The payment is released without having the invoice? How do you know the amount to pay? Without the invoice, you cannot verify the amount.
          * The goods are received after the payment. Again, you should receive goods before paying (unless there is a specific arrangement, but typically not in standard P2P).
          * The matching of the invoice to the PO is done after payment, which is too late. The matching should be done to verify the payment.

**Case 1004:**
  - Sequence:
      Create Purchase Requisition -> Approve Purchase Requisition -> Receive Goods -> Issue Purchase Order -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Match Invoice to PO -> Release Payment -> Close Case
  - Anomalies:
      - The goods are received before the PO is issued. This is highly unusual because the PO is the document that authorizes the vendor to deliver the goods. Receiving goods without a PO means there is no formal purchase order, which is a risk for unauthorized goods and may lead to disputes with the vendor about the order details.
      - Also, the PO is issued after receiving the goods. This is backwards. The PO should be issued before the vendor ships the goods.

**Summary of Anomalies:**

1. **Case 1002:**
   - Issue PO without prior approval of the Purchase Requisition.
   - Release payment before receiving goods.

2. **Case 1003:**
   - Release payment without having received the vendor invoice and before receiving goods.
   - The matching of the invoice to the PO is done after payment.

3. **Case 1004:**
   - Receive Goods before Issue Purchase Order.

**Why these are problematic?**

- **Unauthorized Purchases:** Issuing a PO without approval (Case 1002) bypasses internal controls and may lead to purchases that are not budgeted or approved.
- **Payment Risks:** Releasing payment before receiving goods (Cases 1002, 1003) means the company pays without having the goods, which may result in financial loss if the vendor does not deliver. Also, releasing payment without an invoice (Case 1003) is risky because the amount to pay is not verified.
- **Lack of Verification:** Matching the invoice to the PO after payment (Case 1003) means that if there is a discrepancy, it is too late to withhold payment. This may lead to overpayment or disputes that are harder to resolve.
- **Unordered Goods:** Receiving goods without a PO (Case 1004) means there is no formal agreement with the vendor and the company may receive goods that are not needed or at incorrect terms. It also raises the question of how the vendor knew to send the goods without a PO.

These anomalies indicate potential weaknesses in the process execution and control measures, which could lead to financial loss, operational inefficiencies, and compliance issues.

### Analysis of Anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay Event Log

Below is an analysis of each case in the event log, highlighting deviations from the standard **Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process sequence** and explaining why these anomalies are problematic. The standard P2P sequence is:  
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**   
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**   
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**   
4. **Receive Goods**   
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**   
6. **Match Invoice to PO**   
7. **Release Payment**   
8. **Close Case**  

Deviations from this sequence may indicate control failures, inefficiencies, or fraud risks.  

---

#### **Case 1001: Standard Sequence**  
- **Sequence:**  
  Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice  Match Invoice  Release Payment  Close Case.  
- **Analysis:**  
  Follows the standard P2P flow. Goods are received before the invoice, which is typical. No anomalies.  

---

#### **Case 1002: Critical Deviations**  
- **Sequence:**  
  Create Requisition  **Issue PO**  **Vendor Invoice**  **Release Payment**  **Approve Requisition**  Receive Goods  Match Invoice  Close Case.  
- **Anomalies:**  
  1. **Payment released before approving the requisition and receiving goods.**  
     - **Problem:**  
       - Releasing payment **before approving the requisition** violates internal controls. Unapproved purchases risk budget overruns or fraud.  
       - Releasing payment **before receiving goods** violates the principle of "no payment without delivery." This exposes the company to fraud (e.g., paying for undelivered goods) and cash flow inefficiencies.  
  2. **PO issued without approval.**  
     - **Problem:**  
       - Issuing a PO before requisition approval bypasses authorization controls, allowing unauthorized spending.  

---

#### **Case 1003: Severe Process Violations**  
- **Sequence:**  
  Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  Issue PO  **Release Payment**  **Vendor Invoice**  **Receive Goods**  Match Invoice  Close Case.  
- **Anomalies:**  
  1. **Payment released before receiving goods or invoice.**  
     - **Problem:**  
       - Paying **before receiving goods** is a high-risk violation. The company pays without verifying delivery, risking non-payment for undelivered goods or overpayment.  
       - Paying **before the invoice is received** is illogical—there is no basis for the payment amount.  
  2. **Invoice matching occurs after payment.**  
     - **Problem:**  
       - Matching the invoice to the PO **after payment** defeats the purpose of verification. Discrepancies (e.g., wrong pricing) cannot be resolved, leading to overpayment or disputes.  

---

#### **Case 1004: Reversed Core Activities**  
- **Sequence:**  
  Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  **Receive Goods**  **Issue PO**  Vendor Invoice  Match Invoice  Release Payment  Close Case.  
- **Anomalies:**  
  1. **Goods received before issuing a PO.**  
     - **Problem:**  
       - Receiving goods **without a PO** is a critical control failure. It implies:  
         - No formal agreement with the vendor (e.g., price, quantity, terms).  
         - High risk of receiving unauthorized/incorrect goods.  
         - Potential for disputes over payment terms.  
  2. **PO issued after goods receipt.**  
     - **Problem:**  
       - The PO should authorize the vendor to deliver goods. Issuing it afterward suggests reactive purchasing, increasing costs and delivery delays.

### **Summary of Key Anomalies and Risks**  
| Case ID | Anomaly | Why It’s Problematic |  
|---------|---------|----------------------|  
| **1002** | Payment released before goods receipt and requisition approval. | - **Fraud risk:** Paying for undelivered goods. <br>- **Control failure:** Unapproved spending. |  
| **1003** | Payment released before goods/invoice receipt and matching. | - **Financial loss:** Paying without verification. <br>- **Process breakdown:** Invoice matching too late. |  
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issuance. | - **Control failure:** No purchase authorization. <br>- **Operational risk:** Unauthorized/unverified goods. |  

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Enforce sequence controls** in the P2P system (e.g., block payment without goods receipt and invoice).  
2. **Implement automated checks** (e.g., alerts if PO is issued pre-approval).  
3. **Audit cases 1002–1004** to investigate root causes (e.g., human error, system gaps, or fraud).  

These anomalies highlight vulnerabilities in the P2P process that could lead to financial losses, compliance issues, and operational inefficiencies.
