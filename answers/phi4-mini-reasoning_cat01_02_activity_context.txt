<think>

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to rename recurring activities within each case so that their context is clear. Let me start by looking at each case individually and then see if there's a pattern across all cases.

Looking at Case C001 first. The activities are: Initiate Request, Verify Documents (twice), Call Customer, Submit Additional... Wait, the third activity for C001 is "Call Customer" which happens after verification was incomplete. Then later there's "Submit Additional". That's part of SelfServe by customer. So the two Verify Documents steps in this case have different contexts. The first one is done by BackOfficeAgent as identity check, then after a call to get missing docs, they do it again with all documents.

In C002, Initiate Request, then two Verify Documents (by agent), then Call Customer for clarification, Adjust Account, another Call Customer follow-up, and Approve. Here the second Verify might be similar but perhaps different? Like first verifying initial identity, then after adjustment maybe a re-verification isn't needed here. Wait, in C002's case: The adjust account is done by BackOfficeAgent internally after call. Then there's a follow-up call to confirm adjustments.

So for each recurring activity, I need to find what changed between occurrences. Let's list out the activities per case:

**Case C001:**
1. Initiate Request (WebPortal)
2. Verify Documents (BackOfficeAgent) - first verification
3. Call Customer (FrontlineAgent) after incomplete verification.
4. Submit Additional... (CustomerSelfServe) where customer uploads missing docs.
5. Verify Documents again (BackofficeAgent) now with ID scan provided.
6. Approve Request (Supervisor)

So the two Verifies here are different: first is checking identity documents, second after submission of additional docs.

**Case C002:**
1. Initiate Request
2. Verify Documents
3. Call Customer (Outbound call for clarification)
4. Adjust Account (BackOfficeAgent internally)
5. Call Customer again (follow-up to confirm adjustments)
6. Approve

Here the two Verifies here might not be present? Wait, no. C002 has "Verify Documents" only once. Then after adjust account and a follow-up call. Hmm. So in this case, maybe there's only one Verify Document step, but then why is there another activity called Call Customer for clarification followed by adjustment and confirmation?

Wait, perhaps the problem statement says that within a single case, same activities appear multiple times with different contexts. But looking at C002: Initiate Request, Verify Documents (once), Call Customer (twice). So maybe in this case, only "Call Customer" occurs twice but under different reasons? Or maybe there's another activity I'm missing?

Wait the original log for C002:

- After initiate and verify documents (which is done by BackOfficeAgent?), then call customer outbound. Then adjust account internally after call. Then follow-up call to confirm adjustments.

So perhaps in this case, "Call Customer" occurs twice but under different contexts: first as an outbound call during verification process, second as a confirmation after adjustment.

But the problem states that same activity names appear multiple times within a single case with different meanings. So for each such occurrence, we need to rename them so their context is clear.

Similarly, in C003:

Initiate Request (BranchReception), Verify Documents (BranchOfficer physically), then Call Customer (BranchOfficer calling customer back), Adjust Account (BackOfficeAgent), Verify Documents again (now after adjustment?), and Approve.

So here the two Verifies are: first physical check of ID, second re-check after account correction due to missing info.

Now, looking for recurring activities across cases. For example, "Verify Documents" appears in all three cases multiple times but each time with different context.

Similarly, "Call Customer" occurs twice in C001 and once in C002? Wait no: In C001, Call Customer is one event; in C002, two events (outbound call for clarification and follow-up). But the problem says same activity names within a single case. So per case:

C001 has Verify Documents twice.

C002 doesn't have any recurring activities except maybe "Call Customer" once? Wait no: Let me check again.

Wait original data:

Case C001's events are:

1. Initiate Request

2. Verify Documents (BackOfficeAgent)

3. Call Customer (FrontlineAgent)  after incomplete verification.

4. Submit Additional... (CustomerSelfServe) by customer.

5. Verify Documents again (BackofficeAgent with ID scan provided).

6. Approve Request.

So here, "Verify Documents" occurs twice in the same case.

Case C002:

1. Initiate Request

2. Verify Documents (by BackOfficeAgent?)

3. Call Customer (Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy)

4. Adjust Account (BackOfficeAgent internally after call.)

5. Call Customer again (follow-up to confirm adjustments).

6. Approve.

So here, "Call Customer" occurs twice in the same case but under different contexts: first as an outbound during verification process, second for confirmation post-adjustment.

Case C003:

1. Initiate Request

2. Verify Documents (BranchOfficer physically)

3. Call Customer (BranchOfficer calls customer to have them return.)

4. Adjust Account (BackOfficeAgent internal correction due to missing info.)

5. Verify Documents again (BranchOfficer re-check after adjustment?)

6. Approve.

So here, "Verify Documents" occurs twice in the same case: first physical verification at branch, second after account adjustment possibly because of some issue or as part of final check.

Now, for each recurring activity within a case, we need to rename them so their names reflect context.

Let's list per case which activities recur:

**Case C001:**
- Verify Documents (twice): First time by BackOfficeAgent when checking identity. Second after Submit Additional where customer uploaded the ID scan provided, and then re-checked again with all documents.

Wait wait in the log for C001, step 4 is "Submit Additional" which is SelfServe by customer uploading missing docs. Then step5 is Verify Documents again (BackofficeAgent) now that ID scan is provided. So perhaps after submitting additional info via self-service, they do a re-verification? Or maybe during submission of the additional document, it's already verified?

Wait the original log says:

For C001: After "Call Customer" at 09:45 leading to Submit Additional (customer uploads requested ID scan) at 10:10. Then Verify Documents again (same agent?) at 10:30.

So after submitting the additional docs via self-service, they re-verify documents? Maybe there's a step where once the missing doc is provided and uploaded by customer, but maybe due to process rules, another verification is needed post-upload?

Alternatively, perhaps during submission of the additional document (step4), that was part of verifying. But in any case, according to the log, there are two Verify Documents steps.

So for C001's first Verify: "Verify Identity Documents" by BackOfficeAgent after initiate but before call customer when verification incomplete.

Second verify is done again post-submission where documents now include scanned ID? So perhaps more complete?

In this case, maybe rename them as:

First instance of Verify Documents  "Identity Verification Initial"

Second instance  "Document Re-verification Post-Self-Service Submission" or something. But the name should be concise but descriptive.

Alternatively, since in C002 and C003, there's only one Verify Documents step except for when Adjust Account happens followed by a re-verification? Not exactly. Let's check:

Wait no: For example, in Case C001's second verify is after Submit Additional (which was self-service), then the agent does another verification.

In any case, within each case, we need to rename activities that recur with different context.

So for C001:

1st Verify Documents  "Initial Document Verification"

2nd Verify Documents  "Post-Self-Service Documentation Check" or perhaps just "Document Re-Verification".

But what's the difference between them? The first is checking identity documents when initial verification was incomplete. Then after customer uploads additional docs (via self-service), they do another check, maybe to confirm that all required docs are now present.

Alternatively, since in C002 and C003 there's only one Verify Documents step unless adjusted account leads to a re-verification. Wait no: In case of C002:

After adjust account (step4) which is done by BackOfficeAgent internally after call customer (step3), then they have another Call Customer for follow-up at 09:50.

Then Approve Request at 10:05.

So in this case, there's only one Verify Documents step. So maybe the recurring activities are:

For C001: two Verifies  different names based on context.

C002: "Call Customer" occurs twice but under different contexts (call for clarification vs confirmation). Are they considered same activity? According to the problem statement, we need to rename them if same name appears multiple times with different meanings. So in this case, C002's two Call Customers are separate instances of the same action but done at different stages.

Similarly, perhaps "Adjust Account" occurs once and isn't repeated. Wait no: Adjust Account is step4 for C002. Then there's a follow-up call (step5) which is still called "Call Customer".

So in that case, within the same case:

- Initiate Request  1 time

- Verify Documents  if it's only once? No, wait original log shows two Verifies in C001 and one in others.

Wait no: looking back at Case C002's events as per user input:

Case C002 has "Initiate Request", then "Verify Documents" (once), "Call Customer" twice. Then Adjust Account once, Approve Request once.

So within C002, only two Call Customer steps but same activity name? So they are considered the same action occurring at different points in the process: first during verification to clarify discrepancy, second after adjustments have been made and confirming with customer.

Thus, for each case where an activity occurs multiple times, we need to rename them so that their context is captured in the new names.

Similarly, looking at Case C003:

- Initiate Request

- Verify Documents (twice)

So same activity "Verify Documents" happens twice here. First physical verification by BranchOfficer, then after adjusting account where re-verification occurs? Wait no: Adjust Account step4 for C003 is done by BackOfficeAgent internally due to missing info. Then next event is another "Verify Documents" at 12:20.

So perhaps the second verify in C003's case happens because after adjustment there was an issue that needed a final check, or maybe as part of standard procedure post-adjustment.

Now, for each recurring activity within their respective cases:

**Case C001:**

- Activity A: "Verify Documents" occurs twice. Need to rename them differently.

First occurrence (step2): Agent checks identity documents when verification was incomplete.

Second occurrence (step5): After customer self-service submission of additional docs and agent re-checks now that ID scan is provided.

Possible new names:

1st Verify  "Initial Identity Verification"

2nd Verify  "Post-Self-Service Documentation Validation" or just "Document Re-Verification".

But perhaps more precise. Since the second one might be a check after self-service submission, maybe it's called "Documentation Update Check".

Alternatively, considering that in C002 and C003 there's only one verify documents step except for when adjust account is followed by another action.

Wait no: For example, if an activity like Adjust Account occurs once per case. But according to the problem statement, same name appears multiple times within a single case with different context. So unless such activities recur in the log as shown.

So back to C001's two Verifies:

- First "Verify Documents"  identity check when incomplete.

Second after self-service submission: maybe re-check or confirm that documents are complete now? But according to the Additional Context column, for step5 of C001, it's stated as "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."

So perhaps in this case, renaming them to:

1st Verify  "Verify Identity Documents Initial"

2nd Verify  "Re-Verify Complete Documentation" or just "Documentation Recheck Post-Self-Service".

Alternatively, using a different method like adding prefixes: First "Initial Document Verification", second "Final Document Check".

But the goal is to make sure that each name clearly reflects its role. So for C001:

First occurrence of Verify Documents (step2): Agent checks identity documents when incomplete.

Second occurrence (step5): After customer self-service submission, agent re-checks with provided ID scan. Maybe this second verify confirms all required documentation now includes the scanned ID?

So perhaps first "Identity Document Verification" and second "Documentation Re-Verification with Self-Service Submission".

But that might be too verbose. Alternatively, since in C001's case, after submitting additional documents via self-service (step4), they do a re-verification to ensure everything is correct.

Alternatively, the two Verifies could have different activity names such as:

First: "Verify Identity Documents"

Second: "Re-Synchronize Documentation" or something else. But perhaps more accurately reflecting their role in each step.

Similarly for other cases.

**Case C002:** The recurring activities are two instances of "Call Customer". So need to rename them based on context.

First call (step3): Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.

Second call (step5): Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made after internal adjustment by BackOfficeAgent.

So possible new names:

1st Call  "Clarification Call"

2nd Call  "Confirmation Follow-Up Call" or just "Follow-Up Confirmation".

Alternatively, use more descriptive terms like "Outbound Clarification Call" and "Inbound Post-Adjustment Verification Call". But maybe the first is outbound clarification during investigation phase, second after adjustments have been made.

**Case C003:** Two instances of "Verify Documents".

First occurrence (step2): Physical verification by BranchOfficer at branch with customer present.

Second occurrence (step5): After adjusting account due to missing info. So perhaps this re-verification ensures that the adjustment was correct and all necessary documents are in order now?

So possible new names:

1st Verify  "Physical ID Verification"

2nd Verify  "Post-Adjustment Documentation Recheck".

Alternatively, given it's a branch scenario: first is physical check at location with customer; second could be internal verification after account correction.

Now, compiling this into revised event log:

Let's go through each case and adjust the activity names accordingly.

**Revised Event Log:**

|---------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| C002    | Initiate Request       | 2024-05-02 08:05:00  | WebPortal        | Customer submitted request via portal.                 |

|---------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| C003    | Initiate Request       | 2024-05-03 11:20:00  | BranchReception  | Walk-in customer at branch.                            |
| C003    | Physical ID Check      | 2024-05-03 11:25:00  | BranchOfficer    | Officer physically verifies customer's identity in-person. |
| C003    | Customer Escort Call   | 2024-05-03 11:50:00  | BranchOfficer    | Officer calls customer to have them return for follow-up. |

| C003    | Post-Correction ID Recheck | 2024-05-03 12:20:00 | BranchOfficer    | Officer re-verifies documents after correction in progress. |
| C003    | Approve Request       | 2024-05-03 12:30:00  | Supervisor        | Final approval given.                                   |

**Justification for Naming Choices:**

C001:
- "Initial Identity Check" replaces the first Verify Documents, indicating it's an initial check when verification is incomplete.
- "Documentation Recheck" reflects that after self-service submission of additional documents (e.g., ID scan), there's a re-verification to ensure completeness.

C002:
- The two "Call Customer" activities are renamed to "Clarification Call" and "Post-Adjustment Confirmation Call". This distinction highlights their different purposes: one during investigation, the other as confirmation after adjustments.
- "Account Adjustment" is retained but in original log step4 was called Adjust Account; no need for renaming here since it's a unique activity.

C003:
- First Verify Documents renamed to "Physical ID Check" emphasizing physical verification at branch.
- Second Rename to "Post-Correction ID Recheck" indicating re-verification after internal account correction due to missing info. This clarifies that the second check is part of post-correction steps.

This approach ensures each activity's name reflects its specific role and timing in the process, disambiguating any overlapping contexts within individual cases.

```

**Naming Choices Justification:**

1. **C001:**  
   - *Initial Identity Check*: Reflects the first verification of incomplete identity documents by an agent.  
   - *Documentation Recheck*: Indicates a follow-up re-verification after self-service submission of additional documentation (e.g., ID scan) to ensure completeness.

2. **C002:**  
   - *Clarification Call*: Highlights outbound communication during investigation phase.  
   - *Post-Adjustment Confirmation*: Specifies post-adjustment verification via customer call, distinguishing it from the clarification step.

3. **C003:**  
   - *Physical ID Check*: Emphasizes in-person physical document verification at the branch.  
   - *Post-Correction ID Recheck*: Clarifies re-verification after internal account corrections due to missing information, ensuring final checks are documented.

**Key Contextual Clues:**  
- Activity names were updated based on **timing**, **responsible entity** (e.g., "BranchOfficer" vs. "BackOfficeAgent"), and **process stage** (initial verification  clarification  self-service submission).  
- Unique terminology was adopted to differentiate between similar actions performed under distinct circumstances within each case.
