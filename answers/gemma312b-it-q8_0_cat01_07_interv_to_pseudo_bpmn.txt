**Exception Handling & Notes:**

*   **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) Involvement:** Karen is involved when there are discrepancies or missing information, acting as a liaison with suppliers. She doesn't directly approve invoices.
*   **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) Involvement:** Rita handles escalated issues and invoices without POs, coordinating with departments and suppliers.
*   **Informal Services:** For services without formal POs, Rita works with department heads to create retrospective POs or decide on rejection.
*   **Budgeting:** Carlos may reject invoices if they exceed budgeted amounts.
*   **Looping:** The process may loop back to earlier steps (e.g., contacting the supplier, clarifying discrepancies) if issues are not resolved.
*   **Uncertainty:**  The exact sequence of steps after manager approval and before scheduling payment is not entirely clear from the interviews, but it is assumed to involve Accounts Payable.
*   **System Notifications:** The system automatically sends email notifications for approval requests.
