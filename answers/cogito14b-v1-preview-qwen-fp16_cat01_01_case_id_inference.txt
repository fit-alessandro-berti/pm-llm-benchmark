Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to group the given hospital process events into distinct patient journeys (cases) based on their attributes and logical order.

First, I need to look for patterns in the data that might indicate which events belong together. Key factors here would be:
- Patient demographics (age, gender)
- Sequential activities
- Timing of events

Let's start by looking at each event:

1-2: Registration in ER for two different patients.
3: Registration in Surgery department.

4-5: Initial triage in ER for the patients registered earlier. The patient ages and genders match with 1 and 2, so likely these are linked to those registrations.

6: Consultation in Surgery for a new patient (patient age 28). Since this is after registration in event 3, this seems to belong to that case.

7-9: Events related to the ER patients. Triage code indicates urgency, followed by X-ray and lab tests. These events align with the first two registrations.

10: Lab test completion for patient age 62 (matching event 2), confirming part of their journey in ER.

11-13: More doctor consultations leading to diagnoses and procedures. The ages match previous entries.

Events like 14-17 are follow-up actions after treatments, which should be grouped with the earlier events based on patient demographics.

Lastly, event 18 is a discharge for the surgery case (patient age 28).

So, each unique combination of age and gender would form a distinct case. Let's map these out.

Based on analyzing the sequences and matching attributes, I can group these events into three separate cases:

### Case 1: ER Patient (45M)
**Timeline:**
- 08:05 - Registration (ER, private insurance)  
- 08:10 - Triage (Code 3)  
- 08:15 - X-ray imaging (left leg)  
- 08:22 - Consultation with Dr. Smith (diagnosis: hairline fracture)  
- 08:27 - Prescription created (antibiotics)  
- 08:30 - Discharged to outpatient clinic  

**Key Attributes:** 
Age: 45, Gender: M, Department: ER

---

### Case 2: ER Patient (62F)
**Timeline:**
- 08:07 - Registration (ER, public insurance)  
- 08:12 - Triage (Code 2)  
- 08:16 - Lab test requested (blood panel)  
- 08:20 - Lab test completed (normal levels)  
- 08:23 - Consultation with Dr. Smith (diagnosis: minor infection)  
- 08:35 - Discharged to pharmacy pickup  

**Key Attributes:** 
Age: 62, Gender: F, Department: ER

---

### Case 3: Surgery Patient (28M)
**Timeline:**
- 08:07 - Registration (Surgery, private insurance)  
- 08:13 - Doctor consultation (scheduled knee surgery)  
- 08:16 - Surgery preparation (general anesthesia)  
- 08:25 - Surgery performed (arthroscopy)  
- 08:31 - Recovery room (stable condition)  
- 08:40 - Discharged to physiotherapy sessions  

**Key Attributes:** 
Age: 28, Gender: M, Department: Surgery

The grouping was determined by matching patient demographics (age and gender), sequence of activities, and the logical flow through different departments. Each case represents a distinct patient journey from registration through treatment and discharge.
