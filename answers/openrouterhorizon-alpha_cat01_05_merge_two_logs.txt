Merged event log (chronological, primary timestamp from System A when merged; otherwise from the originating system). Tolerance for matching: ±2 seconds. Matching keys: order_id + semantic event mapping + timestamp proximity.

Integrated events:
1) 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z | event: Order Received | order_id: Order#1234 | source: merged(A+B)
   - timestamps: A=2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, B=2023-10-10T09:59:58Z (delta 2s; within tolerance)
   - unified_name: Order Received
   - user_id: u45
   - resource_id: r10
   - notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"
   - primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z
   - alt_timestamp_b: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z
   - event_name_b: OrderReceived
   - event_type_a: Order Received

2) 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z | event: Order Validated | order_id: Order#1234 | source: merged(A+B)
   - timestamps: A=2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, B=2023-10-10T10:01:29Z (delta 1s; within tolerance)
   - unified_name: Order Validated
   - user_id: u12
   - resource_id: r10
   - notes: "Cross-check inventory"
   - primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
   - alt_timestamp_b: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z
   - event_name_b: OrderValidation
   - event_type_a: Order Validated

3) 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | event: Payment Processed | order_id: Order#1234 | source: merged(A+B)
   - timestamps: A=2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, B=2023-10-10T10:02:05Z (delta 5s; exceeds 2s tolerance, but semantically equivalent and close; merged with note)
   - unified_name: Payment Processed
   - user_id: u12
   - resource_id: r99
   - notes: "Payment gateway delay"
   - primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
   - alt_timestamp_b: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z
   - event_name_b: PaymentCheck
   - event_type_a: Payment Processed
   - merge_confidence: medium (semantic match + short lag likely due to gateway delay)

4) 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z | event: Quality Check | order_id: Order#1234 | source: B-only
   - timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z
   - user_id: u45
   - resource_id: r11
   - notes: "Random inspection"
   - rationale: No corresponding event in A; included as-is.

5) 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z | event: Item Shipped | order_id: Order#1234 | source: merged(A+B)
   - timestamps: A=2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, B=2023-10-10T10:05:02Z (delta 2s; within tolerance)
   - unified_name: Item Shipped
   - user_id: u45
   - resource_id: r10
   - notes: "Package handed to courier"
   - primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
   - alt_timestamp_b: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z
   - event_name_b: Shipping
   - event_type_a: Item Shipped

6) 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z | event: Item Delivered | order_id: Order#1234 | source: A-only
   - timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z
   - rationale: No corresponding event in B; included as-is.

Reasoning and conflict resolution:
- Matching criteria: Same order_id, semantically similar event names, and timestamp difference within ±2 seconds. For Payment Processed vs PaymentCheck, we allowed a 5-second tolerance due to clear semantic equivalence and supporting note about payment gateway delay; confidence marked medium.
- Primary timeline: System A timestamps used as primary when merged, consistent with A being the “received” timeline. We preserved System B’s timestamps as alt_timestamp_b for traceability.
- Naming normalization: Mapped B names to A names using semantics:
  - OrderReceived  Order Received
  - OrderValidation  Order Validated
  - PaymentCheck  Payment Processed
  - Shipping  Item Shipped
  - Quality Check had no A counterpart; retained as-is.
- Unmatched events: Quality Check (B-only) and Item Delivered (A-only) were included without merging and labeled by origin.
- Attribute enrichment: When merged, we included user_id, resource_id, and notes from B alongside A’s event_type. Where only one source existed, we kept available attributes and origin.
- Ordering: Events presented chronologically by primary timestamp; for merged events, that is System A’s timestamp; for single-source events, that source’s timestamp. This yields the sequence: Order Received  Order Validated  Payment Processed  Quality Check  Item Shipped  Item Delivered.

If stricter tolerance (2s) is required, mark Payment Processed and PaymentCheck as separate entries; otherwise, the above merge preserves richer context and likely represents the same activity with minor system latency.
