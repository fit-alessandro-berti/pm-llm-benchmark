**Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model:**

1. **R  P (Receive to Approve):**
   - *Average Time:* ~25 hours  
   - *Standard Deviation:* 1 hour (very low)  
   - *Observation:* The average time between receiving a claim and approving it is relatively quick, but the extremely low variability suggests that this interval might be overly rigid or artificially enforced.

2. **P  N (Approve to Notify):**
   - *Average Time:* 7 days  
   - *Standard Deviation:* 2 days (high)  
   - *Observation:* The approval-to-notification step shows significant delay, with high variability indicating inconsistency in the timing of notifications after a claim is approved.

3. **A  C (Assign to Close):**
   - *Average Time:* 2 hours  
   - *Standard Deviation:* 1 hour  
   - *Observation:* Claims are being closed very soon after assignment without intermediate steps like evaluation or approval, suggesting premature closures possibly due to oversight or manual intervention.

4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - *Average Time:* 5 minutes  
   - *Standard Deviation:* 1 minute  
   - *Observation:* The rapid transition from evaluation to notification may indicate skipping of intermediate steps or overly aggressive automation that doesn't allow for necessary checks and balances.

**Possible Hypotheses on Anomalies:**

- **R  P (Receive to Approve):**
  - Automated systems might be immediately advancing claims toward approval without adequate review, leading to a fixed interval.
  - Policy constraints could enforce quick approvals under certain conditions or claim types.

- **P  N (Approve to Notify):**
  - Backlogs in notification processes due to limited staff resources.
  - Deliberate delay for legal/compliance reviews that aren't consistently applied across all claims.

- **A  C (Assign to Close):**
  - Incomplete process adherence where adjusters close cases without following the full workflow.
  - Systematic errors or UI/UX issues in the claim management software causing premature closure.

- **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**
  - Automation scripts might be triggering notifications too quickly after evaluation, bypassing checks for correctness and completeness.
  - Staff might be manually overriding evaluations without appropriate documentation, speeding up closure.

**Proposed Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries:**

1. **Identify Specific Claims with Abnormal Intervals:**

```sql
-- Identify claims where R to P interval is less than or greater than expected bounds (e.g., outside 2 hours ± 30 minutes)
SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS receive_time, MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(timestamp))) AS interval_seconds
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('R', 'P')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(timestamp)) - 3600)) < 1800;
```

2. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters, Claim Types, or Resources:**

```sql
-- Find claims where the average time between P and N exceeds 5 days significantly more often for specific adjusters
SELECT claim_id,
       resource AS assigner,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) / 86400.0 AS p_to_n_days
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
GROUP BY claim_id, resource
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) / 86400.0 > 5;
```

3. **Filter Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment:**

```sql
-- Find claims where A to C interval is less than or equal to expected bounds (e.g., within 2 hours ± 30 minutes)
SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS assign_time, MAX(timestamp) AS close_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp))) / 3600.0 AS a_to_c_hours
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('A', 'C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)) / 3600.0 - 2)) < 0.5;
```

4. **Examine Claims with Long Approval to Notification Times:**

```sql
-- Find claims where the time between approval and notification is significantly longer than average (e.g., more than 10 days)
SELECT claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
       MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) / 86400.0 AS p_to_n_days
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) / 86400.0 > 10;
```

These queries help surface claims and patterns where the timing of activities diverges from expected norms, providing a basis for deeper investigation into potential systemic issues or process inefficiencies.
