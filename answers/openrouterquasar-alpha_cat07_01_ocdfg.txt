This visualization depicts a detailed process flow of an order-to-invoice business process, highlighting various interconnected business objects, activities, their volumes, and transition times.

### Key Features:
- **Start Nodes & Process Objects:**
  - Multiple starting points representing different business document types:
    - **VendorInvoiceItem** (1.2M objects)
    - **ReturnOrderItem** (0.8M)
    - **PurchaseRequisitionItem** (2.0M)
    - **SalesOrderItem** (3.5M)
    - **PurchaseOrderItem** (5.0M)
  
- **Main Processes:**
  - **Create Requisition**: Initiated from PurchaseRequisitionItem, leading to the approval step.
  - **Approve Requisition**: Central hub connecting to stock checking, order sending, return processing, payment approval, and invoicing.
  - **Create Order**: Triggered by SalesOrderItem and PurchaseOrderItem; branches into packing and shipping.
  - **Pack Goods**  **Ship Goods**  **Confirm Delivery**  **Close Order**: Main sales order fulfillment flow.
  - **Send Order, Check Stock, Process Return, Approve Payment, Create Invoice**: Supporting activities with various connections.
  
- **Volumes:**
  - For example, **Create Order** handles the highest volume with 8.5M objects, indicating a critical step.
  - Other activities operate on millions of objects overall, as labeled inside each box.

- **Connecting Arrows:**
  - Represent transitions, labeled with the average processing times (in milliseconds) between process steps.
  - Different colored lines might indicate related but separate workflows or data flows, such as procurement, sales, returns, and payments.

- **End Nodes:**
  - Processes conclude at multiple endpoints after activities like **Send Order**, **Create Invoice**, **Close Order**, etc.

### Summary:
This visualization provides an overview of the procurement-to-sales-to-invoicing cycle with returns and payment processing included. It tracks the flow of documents and actions, illustrates how different processes interlink, and provides performance insights through object counts and processing times. This can help identify bottlenecks or areas for process optimization in a complex business workflow.
