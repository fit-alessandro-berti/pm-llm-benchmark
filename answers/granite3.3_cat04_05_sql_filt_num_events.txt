```sql
WITH CaseEventCounts AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    COUNT(*) AS event_count
  FROM
    event_log
  GROUP BY
    case_id
  HAVING
    COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT *
FROM
  event_log
WHERE
  case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM CaseEventCounts);
```

This DuckDB SQL query achieves the task by first creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `CaseEventCounts`. This CTE calculates the number of events for each `case_id` using the `COUNT(*)` window function and groups by `case_id`. The `HAVING` clause filters out any `case_id` that has more than six events.

The main query then selects all rows from `event_log`, filtering it to include only those rows where the `case_id` exists in the `CaseEventCounts` CTE, which ensures that only cases with 6 or fewer events are included in the final result set.
