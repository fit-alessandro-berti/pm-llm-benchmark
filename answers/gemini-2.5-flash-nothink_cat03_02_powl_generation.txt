# Exclusive choice for Deployment methods
# Either Containerized Deployment (CD) or Monolithic Deployment (MD)
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# 3. Construct the main StrictPartialOrder (root of the process)
# We will build this up step-by-step based on the flow.

# Start with the initial sequence: SR -> CS
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# After CS, DA and ACI can happen in parallel.
# These two tasks (DA and ACI) have no ordering constraints between them.
# The `root` currently contains SR and CS. We need to add DA and ACI and link them.
# We also need a placeholder for the point where both DA and ACI are completed
# before linking to the loop_config.

# Create a temporary partial order for DA and ACI
po_datacenter_access = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
# No edges needed as they are concurrent

# Create a placeholder node to represent the completion of CS before the parallel DA/ACI
# Or, more directly, link CS to both DA and ACI in the main root.
# Then, the loop_config must wait for both DA and ACI.

# Add DA, ACI, and the loop_config to the root's nodes
root.nodes.add(DA)
root.nodes.add(ACI)
root.nodes.add(loop_config)

# Link CS to both DA and ACI
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# The loop_config must wait for both DA and ACI to be completed.
# In a StrictPartialOrder, if a node has multiple incoming edges, it waits for all sources.
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_config)

# After the loop_config, comes the exclusive choice for deployment.
root.nodes.add(xor_deployment)
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, xor_deployment)

# After the deployment choice, QA and SA can happen in parallel.
root.nodes.add(QA)
root.nodes.add(SA)

# Link the deployment choice to both QA and SA
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, QA)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, SA)

# Finally, GLA occurs after both QA and SA are completed.
root.nodes.add(GLA)
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# The `root` object now represents the entire POWL model.
# You can inspect its structure if needed (e.g., print(root.nodes), print(root.order.edges))
# Note: For verification, one might typically visualize or simulate this model.
