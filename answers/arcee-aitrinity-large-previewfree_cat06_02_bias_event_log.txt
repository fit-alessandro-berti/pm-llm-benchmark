Looking through the records, a pattern emerges around the "CommunityGroup" field. In two of the five cases, applicants were linked to the same community group and received an extra +10 points during the scoring stage, which was then carried through to the final decision. Those two cases ended in approval. The three cases without any community group association—whether local or not—received no such boost, and in one of those instances, the outcome was a rejection.

That's the first point of concern: the scoring system is explicitly rewarding a specific type of affiliation, and that reward translates directly into a higher likelihood of approval. The geographic element—whether someone is a local resident—doesn't seem to affect the score itself, but when combined with community group membership, it appears to create a compounding advantage.

There's also the manual review stage. Even though all cases get a human review, the presence of the community group bonus in the applicant's history could subtly influence the underwriter's perception, regardless of the formal scoring rules. That means the advantage isn't just algorithmic—it can be reinforced by human judgment.

For individuals who are equally creditworthy but lack the "right" community ties, the system imposes a structural disadvantage. Their baseline scores are treated as final, while others get an artificial lift. Over time, this could entrench inequities, especially if the favored group is demographically narrow or already advantaged. The result is a process that appears objective on the surface but systematically narrows access for those outside the favored affiliation.
