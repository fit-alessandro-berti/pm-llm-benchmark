### Comprehensive Event Log for Process Mining

Below is the integrated event log derived from the provided ERP tables. The log follows the specified requirements:
- **Case ID**: Unique `order_id` for each process instance.
- **Activity Name**: Logically derived from business process steps.
- **Timestamp**: Chronologically ordered events (sorted by timestamp).
- **Resource/Actor**: Mapped to human-readable names using the Resources table.
- **Additional Attributes**: Includes customer, product, delivery, invoice, and payment details where applicable.

#### Key Assumptions:
1. **Resources**: All resource IDs (e.g., `SP-001`, `WH-001`) are mapped to names using the Resources table.
2. **Payments**: No actor is provided for payments, so the `Resource` field is left blank.
3. **Product Details**: Item descriptions and categories are enriched via the Products table.
4. **Order 1004**: No delivery, invoice, or payment events exist in the data.
5. **Chronological Order**: Events are sorted by timestamp. For identical timestamps, events are ordered by `Case ID` and then alphabetically by activity.

### Summary of Process Flow
1. **Order Creation**: Initiated by a sales person (e.g., Alice Brown for Order 1001).
2. **Item Picking**: Performed by warehouse staff (e.g., David Lin for ITEM-001 in Order 1001).
3. **Dispatch & Delivery**: Managed by carriers (e.g., GlobalTransport for Order 1001).
4. **Invoicing**: Handled by billing clerks (e.g., Gina Carter for Order 1001).
5. **Payments**: Recorded with method/reference (no actor specified).

### Notes
- **Order 1004**: Only has "Order Created" and "Items Picked" events (no subsequent steps).
- **Split Deliveries/Invoices**: Orders like 1002 have multiple deliveries/invoices, each logged separately.
- **Resource Mapping**: All resource IDs (e.g., `WH-001`) are replaced with human-readable names (e.g., "David Lin").
- **Chronology**: Events are strictly ordered by timestamp, with ties broken by `Case ID` and activity name.
