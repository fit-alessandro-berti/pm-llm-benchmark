The visualization shows, in three parts, how a simple medical process is modeled and how two process components communicate with each other.

### (a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels  

Left side – **“Lab visit” proclet**

- Represents what happens during a patient’s visit.
- Actors: a doctor and a lab assistant (icons on the left).
- Activities (rectangles) linked by small circles (states/places), in order:
  1. **Order entry** – the doctor/lab assistant enters a lab test order.
  2. **Take blood sample** – the sample is collected.
  3. **Judge results** – later, the lab results are evaluated.
  4. If results are good, the flow goes to **Everything fine** and then **Send report** (end state).
  5. If results are not satisfactory, flow goes to **Do tests again** and later **Receive updated result**, then back to judging/sending.

Right side – **“Lab test” proclet**

- Represents what the laboratory does.
- Actor: chemical analyst (icon near tasks).
- Activities:
  1. **Perform test** – initial performance of the ordered test.
  2. **Make report** – prepare the result.
  3. **Finish lab test** – end state if everything is done once.
  4. If additional tests are requested: **Perform test again** and **Provide updated report**, then back to finishing.

Communication – **two dashed boxes (channels)**

- **Order system** (top dashed rectangle):
  - Connects the Lab visit’s *Order entry* to the Lab test’s *Perform test*.
  - Essentially: sending a test request from the visit to the lab.
- **HIS (Hospital Information System)** (middle dashed rectangle):
  - Connects Lab test’s reporting steps to Lab visit’s result-handling steps:
    - From *Make report* to *Receive result*.
    - From *Provide updated report* to *Receive updated result*.
  - Used again when additional tests are ordered (from *Do tests again* to *Perform test again*).

The arrows labeled l1, l2, … indicate individual message links between activities across the channels.

### (b) Class diagram of the two proclet classes  

On the upper right is a simple UMLstyle class diagram:

- Class **Lab visit**.
- Class **Lab test**.
- A relationship labeled **requires**:
  - Cardinality from Lab visit to Lab test: `1..*` (one visit requires one or more lab tests).
  - Cardinality on Lab visit side: `1..1` (each Lab test is tied to exactly one visit).

This summarizes the structural relation between the two process components.

### (c) Example of a performative (message)  

The bottom table shows a concrete message sent through a channel:

- **Time**: 11:00  
- **Channel**: *Order system*  
- **Sender**: *Lab visit – John* (the specific Lab visit instance for patient John)  
- **Receiver**: *Lab test – HGB John* (a specific Lab test instance, e.g., hemoglobin test for John)  
- **Action**: *Create* (create a lab test instance)  
- **Content**: “Can you perform a HGB test for John?” (the semantic meaning of the message)  
- **Scope**: *Private* (not broadcast to others)  
- **Direction**: *OUT* (sent from the Lab visit to the Lab test).

This table illustrates how one of the arrows in part (a) is realized as a concrete, timestamped communication event.

Overall, the visualization describes how a patient’s lab visit process and the laboratory testing process are modeled as two interacting proclets, how they are structurally related, and how individual messages (performatives) flow between them via two information system channels.
