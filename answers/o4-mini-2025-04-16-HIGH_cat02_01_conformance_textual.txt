Below is a summary of which cases deviate and exactly how they violate the rules implied by the normative description:

1. Case 1 (Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close)  
   – Fully conforms. No violations.

2. Case 2 (Receive  Check  **Package**  **Authorize**  Ship  Close)  
   Violations:  
   • “Package items” occurs at 10:00, before payment has been authorized at 10:30.  
     Norm: you must “Authorize payment” before you “Package items.”  

3. Case 3 (Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  **Ship**  Close)  
   Violations:  
   • “Ship order” occurs after “Cancel order.”  
     Norm: once you cancel, you must go straight to “Close order” and never perform fulfillment activities (Package or Ship).  

4. Case 4 (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close)  
   – Conforms to the insufficient-inventory path. No violations.

5. Case 5 (Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship**  Close)  
   Violations:  
   • “Ship order” occurs at 11:00 but there is no “Package items” step at all.  
     Norm: you must “Package items” after authorization and before you “Ship order.”

In short, Cases 2, 3 and 5 each break one of the core sequencing rules derived from the textual process description.
