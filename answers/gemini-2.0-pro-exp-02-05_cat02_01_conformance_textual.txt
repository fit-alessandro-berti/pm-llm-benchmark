Okay, let's analyze each case against the provided normative process description:

**Case 1: Compliant**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case perfectly follows the "sufficient inventory" path described in the normative process.  All activities are in the correct order, and "Close order" is the final activity.

**Case 2: Violation**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case violates the rule that "Authorize payment" should occur *after* "Check inventory" and *before* "Package items".  Here, "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment".  The normative description explicitly states that payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known, and items should only be packaged after payment is authorized.

**Case 3: Violation**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case has multiple severe violations.
    *   **Authorize Payment before Cancellation:**  "Authorize payment" should not happen in a cancellation scenario.  The process should go directly from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order" if there is insufficient inventory (though the log doesn't explicitly state the inventory status, the cancellation suggests this).
    *   **Ship Order after Cancellation:**  The most egregious violation is "Ship order" occurring *after* "Cancel order".  The normative description clearly states that shipping after cancellation is illogical and forbidden.

**Case 4: Compliant**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
*   **Analysis:** This case perfectly follows the "insufficient inventory" path described in the normative process.  It goes directly from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order", and then to "Close order".

**Case 5: Violation**

*  **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize Payment -> Ship order -> Close Order
* **Analysis:** Although close, this log is not compliant to the normative process.
The missing action `Package Items` constitutes a violation. The normative process description clearly mentions the `Package Items` between authorizing the payment and shipping the order.

**Summary of Violations:**

*   **Case 2:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment", violating the required order.
*   **Case 3:** "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order", and "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order", both violating the intended cancellation process and logical constraints.
*   **Case 5:** `Package Items` activity is missing, violating the sequence described in the normative process.

**Interpretation of Ambiguities:**

The normative description is relatively clear on the core sequences. The main ambiguity addressed was the potential for actions to occur before or after a cancellation. The description clarifies that a cancellation should immediately precede "Close order" and that no fulfillment-related activities (like authorizing payment or shipping) should occur after a cancellation. The description also reinforces that payment authorization always follows inventory checking. The same is true for packaging items and shipping.
