Okay, let's analyze the event log against the normative process description.

**Summary of Violating Cases:**

Cases **2, 3, and 5** violate the normative process described. Cases 1 and 4 appear conformant.

**Detailed Explanation of Violations:**

1.  **Case 2:**
    *   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> **Package items** -> **Authorize payment** -> Ship order -> Close order
    *   **Violation:** The activity "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment".
    *   **Explanation:** The normative description clearly states: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'" It also reinforces this constraint: "'Package items' should only occur *after* authorization and before shipping". In Case 2, the order of these two activities is reversed, violating the prescribed sequence for the sufficient inventory path.

2.  **Case 3:**
    *   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Cancel order** -> **Ship order** -> Close order
    *   **Violations:**
        *   **Contradictory Activities:** The case includes both "Authorize payment" (which typically follows a sufficient inventory check) and "Cancel order" (which follows an insufficient inventory check). According to the description, these activities belong to mutually exclusive paths based on the outcome of "Check inventory". Their presence together suggests a process logic error.
        *   **Shipping After Cancellation:** The activity "Ship order" occurs *after* "Cancel order".
    *   **Explanation:** The description states that if inventory is insufficient, the process branches to "Cancel order," after which fulfillment activities like shipping are "illogical." It explicitly says: "'Ship order' should... *never* after a cancellation." Case 3 violates this fundamental rule by shipping an order that has seemingly been cancelled. The presence of both authorization and cancellation also conflicts with the described branching logic.

3.  **Case 5:**
    *   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Ship order** -> Close order
    *   **Violation:** The "Package items" activity is missing.
    *   **Explanation:** The normative description specifies the sequence for sufficient inventory as: Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Package items** -> Ship order -> Close order. It emphasizes: "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" Case 5 skips the "Package items" step entirely, proceeding directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order". This omission violates the requirement that items must be packaged before they are shipped.

**Conformant Cases:**

*   **Case 1:** Follows the sequence Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close, which perfectly matches the described normative path for sufficient inventory.
*   **Case 4:** Follows the sequence Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close, which perfectly matches the described normative path for insufficient inventory.
