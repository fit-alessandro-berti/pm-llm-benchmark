I'll analyze each case according to the normative rules and desiderata conditions.

**1. Normative Rules Violations Analysis:**

Case 1:
-  Follows all normative rules perfectly
- Correct sequence maintained
- Proper handling of approved loan with documentation finalization

Case 2:
-  MAJOR VIOLATIONS:
  1. Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (violates mandatory sequence)
  2. Finalized Documentation after a rejection (strictly forbidden)
- These are serious violations of the normative process rules

Case 3:
-  Follows all normative rules
- Correct sequence maintained
- Proper handling of approved loan with documentation finalization

**2. Desiderata Conditions Analysis:**

Case 1:
-  Credit Check done promptly (within 24 hours)
-  Applicant informed promptly (within 48 hours)
-  No Follow-up Call (recommended but not mandatory)

Case 2:
-  Credit Check done promptly
-  Applicant informed promptly (assuming they were informed, though not explicitly shown)
-  No Follow-up Call

Case 3:
-  Credit Check delayed (done after 24 hours)
-  Applicant informed late (more than 48 hours after decision)
-  No Follow-up Call

**3. Interpretations and Justifications:**

Case 1:
- Exemplary process execution
- The only improvement could be adding a Follow-up Call
- Could serve as a "golden path" example for training

Case 2:
- No valid justification for the normative violations
- Suggests serious process control issues or lack of training
- Requires immediate correction and possibly process controls implementation

Case 3:
- While timing is slower than recommended, all required steps are present
- Delays might be justified by:
  * High workload
  * Weekend/holiday interference
  * Resource constraints
- Still compliant with core requirements, just not optimal in timing

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement system controls to prevent sequence violations (especially for Case 2 scenario)
2. Add automated timing alerts for desiderata conditions
3. Create a checklist for Follow-up Calls
4. Consider workflow automation to ensure proper sequencing
5. Provide additional training focusing on the distinction between normative rules and desiderata
