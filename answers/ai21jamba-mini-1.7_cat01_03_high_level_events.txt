### Analysis and Grouping of Low-Level Events

To organize the low-level events into higher-level process steps, I focused on the following criteria:

1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events that occur closely in time are likely part of the same step.
2. **Resource Consistency:** Events initiated and completed by the same resource or resource type often belong together.
3. **Logical Dependency:** Events that represent a sequence of logically connected actions (e.g., preparing, processing, and inspecting) were grouped.
4. **Domain Relevance:** Steps were named to reflect typical manufacturing workflows.

### Proposed High-Level Activities and Justifications

1. **Material Preparation**
	- **Events:**
		- Retrieve raw material.
		- Scan barcode.
		- Place material on table.
		- Align material.
		- Preheat material.
	- **Rationale:**
These events collectively represent the preparatory phase for a material, where it is retrieved, identified, positioned, and prepared for processing. Aligning and preheating are specific preparatory actions that immediately precede processing.
	- **Named Activity:** "Material Preparation."
2. **Assembly**
	- **Events:**
		- Pick up welding tool.
		- Weld corner A.
		- Weld corner B.
	- **Rationale:**
Welding operations involve manipulating a tool to join parts of a material. These actions are logical subsequent steps following material preparation and represent the assembly or joining phase.
	- **Named Activity:** "Assembly."
3. **Quality Inspection**
	- **Events:**
		- Measure weld integrity.
		- Apply protective coating.
		- Dry coating.
		- Visual check.
	- **Rationale:**
These events focus on ensuring the quality and durability of the assembled material. Each action (inspecting, coating, and verifying) is a distinct but sequential part of the quality control process.
	- **Named Activity:** "Quality Inspection."

### High-Level Activity Output

#### 1. **Material Preparation**

- Description: All preparatory actions required to ready a material for further processing, including retrieving, identifying, positioning, and preparing.

#### 2. **Assembly**

- Description: Actions that physically join or piece together components, such as welding or assembling parts.

#### 3. **Quality Inspection**

- Description: Actions that evaluate the quality and durability of the product, including inspections, applying protective measures, and verifying workmanship.

### Example Aggregated Event Grouping (Case A1)

**Step**

**Events**

Material Preparation

Retrieve raw metal sheet  Scan barcode  Place metal sheet on table  Align metal sheet  Preheat metal sheet.

Assembly
