### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R (Receive) to P (Approve)**: The average time is around 25 hours with a very low standard deviation. This suggests a rigid approval process that might be artificially constrained, lacking flexibility or checks for genuine delays.

2. **P (Approve) to N (Notify)**: The average delay is 7 days with a standard deviation of 2 days. This indicates that notifications can be either very quick or very late, suggesting potential backlogs or resource constraints in the approval phase.

3. **A (Assign) to C (Close)**: The average time is only 2 hours, with no other intermediate activities like Evaluate or Approve consistently observed. This might imply premature closure or a bypass of necessary steps in the process.

4. **E (Evaluate) to N (Notify)**: An extremely short average time of 5 minutes suggests a rapid transition that might not follow business rules, or it could indicate skipped intermediate steps.

### Hypotheses on the Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
   - **Systemic Delays:** Manual data entry might introduce large time gaps.
   - **Artificial Constraints:** The approval process might be overly rigid, lacking checks for real delays.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
   - **Resource Constraints:** Limited resources might cause delays in notifications.
   - **Backlogs:** There could be significant backlogs affecting timely notifications.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
   - **Premature Closure:** Claims might be closed without necessary evaluations and approvals.
   - **Bypassed Steps:** Certain claims might skip required intermediate steps.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
   - **Rapid Transitions:** Notifications might be happening prematurely, skipping checks.
   - **Skipped Steps:** Intermediate steps might be being bypassed, leading to quick notifications.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Anomalies**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS receive_timestamp, ce2.timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_difference
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > (90000 + 3 * 3600) OR
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < (90000 - 3 * 3600);
   ```

2. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters**:
   ```sql
   SELECT a.adjuster_id, a.name, COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
   FROM (
       SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp AS time_gap
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
       WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > (90000 + 3 * 3600) OR
             EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < (90000 - 3 * 3600)
   ) AS anomalies
   JOIN claims c ON anomalies.claim_id = c.claim_id
   JOIN adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.customer_id
   GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name;
   ```

3. **Filter by Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS assign_timestamp, ce3.timestamp AS close_timestamp,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce3.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_difference
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A'
   JOIN claim_events ce3 ON c.claim_id = ce3.claim_id AND ce3.activity = 'C'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce3.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200;
   ```

4. **Examine Claims Where Approval to Notification Takes Excessively Long**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, ce2.timestamp AS approve_timestamp, ce4.timestamp AS notify_timestamp,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce4.timestamp - ce2.timestamp)) AS time_difference
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events ce4 ON c.claim_id = ce4.claim_id AND ce4.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce4.timestamp - ce2.timestamp)) > 604800 + 2 * 86400;
   ```

These queries help identify specific claims and adjusters involved in the anomalies, providing insights into potential bottlenecks or irregularities in the process.
