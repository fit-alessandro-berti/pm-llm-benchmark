The process described involves a series of stages and transitions that a declaration goes through within an organization, primarily focusing on its lifecycle from submission to final approval or rejection, followed by payment requests if approved. Here's a breakdown based on the given flow:

1. **Submission Phase:**
   - A declaration starts when it is submitted by an employee.
   - After submission, there are several potential routes:
     * It can be immediately rejected by either the Employee, PRE_APPROVER, or SUPERVISOR, in which case the process might loop back to re-submission or rejection.
     * If not immediately rejected, it goes through a series of approval steps.

2. **Approval Phase:**
   - The declaration moves from "SUBMITTED" to "APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER", then to either:
     - Further approval by ADMINISTRATION leading eventually to "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR",
     - Alternatively, if APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, it can be approved directly by BUDGET OWNER before reaching SUPERVISOR.
   - Alongside this path, there are multiple opportunities for the declaration to be rejected at different stages by various actors including ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER.

3. **Finalization Phase:**
   - Once "FINAL_APPROVED" by a SUPERVISOR, the declaration triggers a payment request if it meets certain criteria or performance metrics.
   - Payment handling is managed after a successful request for payment.
   - If at any stage during finalization, issues arise (e.g., missing details), the process can be rejected and may loop back to earlier stages.

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Each transition between states comes with a frequency count which indicates how many times this specific move occurs in practice.
   - Additionally, performance metrics are given, likely indicating some measure of efficiency or time taken for each step; these might represent average processing times or some other relevant metric.

This flow suggests a highly structured and somewhat complex approval process within an organization that aims to ensure thorough vetting of declarations before any actions like payment requests can be processed. The presence of loops (re-submissions, rejections back to submission) indicates built-in flexibility allowing for corrections and adjustments during the lifecycle of each declaration.
