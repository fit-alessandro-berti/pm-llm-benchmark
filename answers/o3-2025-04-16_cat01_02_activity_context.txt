Why each rename was made  
------------------------

Verify Documents  
• “Initial Check” – first time the agent inspects identity documents (position: right after ticket creation).  
• “Initial Physical Check” – same as above, but emphasises facetoface context (resource = BranchOfficer, channel = branch).  
• “Recheck after Docs Received” – second inspection in C001; happens after the customer has supplied the missing ID scan.  
• “Recheck after Adjustment” – second inspection in C003; done only because account details were corrected two steps earlier.

Call Customer  
• “Request Missing Documents” – outbound call whose purpose (Additional Context) is to obtain missing ID.  
• “Clarify Account Discrepancy” – first call in C002; motive is to understand a discrepancy discovered during verification.  
• “Confirm Adjustments” – followup call in C002; purpose is to validate that the customer agrees with changes already made.  
• “Recall to Branch” – call in C003; officer tries to bring the walkin customer back to the desk.

These new labels expose the distinct intent of each repeated activity, disambiguating them for analysis, conformance checking, or variant discovery.
