Why these new names?

1. “Verify Documents”  
   • The first verification in every case is called “Initial ID Check” (or “Branch Initial ID Check” when performed at a branch) – the context makes clear it is the very first, baseline verification step.  
   • The second verification happens only after something has changed (additional documents in C001, internal adjustment in C003). It is therefore renamed “Post-Submission Re-check” or “Post-Adjustment Re-check” to stress that it is a follow-up control rather than the original verification.

2. “Call Customer”  
   • C001: the call purpose is to ask for missing paperwork, hence “Request Missing Documentation”.  
   • C002: two calls with two distinct intents – first to clarify a discrepancy, second to confirm that the fix was accepted; the names capture those intents directly.  
   • C003: the officer calls the customer back to the branch; the activity is labelled “Recall Customer to Branch”.

The revised labels preserve the order of events but make the differing intents explicit, eliminating ambiguity when the same activity name re-appears inside a case.
