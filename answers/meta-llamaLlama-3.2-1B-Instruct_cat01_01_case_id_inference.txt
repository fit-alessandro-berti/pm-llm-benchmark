To determine the case groupings, we can follow these steps:

1.  Analyze the activities and their timing to identify patterns that can help us group the events into separate cases.
2.  Consider the attributes of each event to determine if they could be indicative of a specific case.
3.  Combine the insights from the analysis of activities and attributes to infer the case groupings.

**Analyzing Activities and Timing:**

1.  **Regular Patterns:** Look for regular patterns in the activities, such as the frequency of certain events within a short period.
2.  **Temporal Relationships:** Identify the temporal relationships between events, such as activities that occur consecutively or in close succession.

**Considering Attributes:**

1.  **Patient Age and Gender:** Look for patients with a specific age group or gender, which could help narrow down the case.
2.  **Department and Resource:** Identify the departments and resources involved in each event, which could provide information about the type of case.
3.  **Medical Conditions:** Look for medical conditions mentioned in the attributes of the events, which could help identify specific cases.
4.  **Triage:** Identify the initial triage for each patient, which could provide information about the type of case.

**Combining Insights:**

1.  **Identify Repeated Patterns:** Analyze the events to identify repeated patterns, such as regular activity types or department assignments.
2.  **Match Events:** Match events with the identified patterns to determine the case groupings.
3.  **Consider Non-Functional Attributes:** Consider the non-functional attributes mentioned in the events, such as patient discharges, prescriptions, and patient follow-ups.

**Example Grouping:**

1.  **Case 1:** Patients under 45 years old (45) from the ER, with 62-year-old females (62)
2.  **Case 2:** Patients between 45-62 years old (50), from the ER, with 28-year-old males (28)
3.  **Case 3:** Patients between 28-45 years old (32), from the Surgery department, with 62-year-old females (62)
4.  **Case 4:** Patients under 28 years old (28) from the ER, with 62-year-old females (62)
5.  **Case 5:** Patients between 28-62 years old (35), from the Surgery department, with 28-year-old males (28)
6.  **Case 6:** Patients between 62 years old (62) from the ER, with patients under 45 years old (45)
7.  **Case 7:** Patients between 28-62 years old (38), from the Surgery department, with patients under 28 years old (28)

These are just some possible case groupings, and the actual grouping would depend on the analysis and insights gained from the event sequence.
