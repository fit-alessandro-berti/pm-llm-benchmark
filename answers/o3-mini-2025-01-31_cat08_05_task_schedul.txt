Below is a detailed, structured approach that blends process mining with advanced scheduling strategy design for Precision Parts Inc.


1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

• Reconstructing the Actual Process Flow  
– Use process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Visual Miner, Heuristic Miner) to extract the “as-is” process models from the MES event logs.  
– Map every job’s progress through the unique sequence of tasks (Cutting, Milling, etc.), capturing transitions between states (e.g., “Queue Entry”, “Setup Start”, “Task Start/End”) and linking them to the resource (machine/operator).  
– Visualize process variants to understand which routings deviate from planned sequences and where rework or delays occur.

• Quantitative Metrics and Techniques  
– Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions  
• Compute cycle times from “Job Released” to final “Task End” for each job.  
• Use statistical analysis (histograms, distribution fitting) to quantify overall lead time variability and identify outlier jobs with excessive makespans.  
• Map flow times by job type and priority to uncover patterns (e.g., are high-priority jobs consistently delayed?).

– Task Waiting Times (Queue Times)  
• Identify timestamps when jobs enter queues (e.g., “Queue Entry”) and when they begin processing (“Setup Start” or “Task Start”).  
• Calculate waiting time distributions per work center and visualize bottlenecks per machine or operator.

– Resource Utilization  
• Utilize time-based metrics to compute each machine’s/worker’s productive time, idle time, and cumulative setup time.  
• Derive utilization ratios and compare them to planned load targets.  
• Distinguish between processing and non–value-add times to quantify inefficiencies.

– Sequence-Dependent Setup Times  
• Analyze transitions between consecutive jobs for each machine by matching “Setup Start” logs to both preceding and current job IDs.  
• Calculate setup time differences based on the previous job’s properties (e.g., job type or material).  
• Use clustering or regression techniques to model how specific job pairings impact setup durations.

– Schedule Adherence and Tardiness  
• For each job, compare the planned due dates with the actual task end times.  
• Compute metrics such as average tardiness, delay frequency, and delay magnitude.  
• Visualize “on-time” vs. “late” variants to understand systemic issues affecting schedule conformance.

– Impact of Disruptions  
• Tag disruptions (e.g., breakdowns, priority changes) and correlate these events with deviations in KPIs (e.g., surge in waiting time, increased WIP).  
• Conduct time-series analysis to detect lag effects between disruption events and shifts in process performance.


2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

• Identification of Bottlenecks  
– Use process mining visualizations (e.g., performance overlays on control-flow graphs) to pinpoint long sojourn times.  
– Quantify the impact by measuring how delays at critical machines (like specialized CNC or specialized milling machines) propagate through subsequent tasks, affecting overall throughput.

• Evidence of Suboptimal Task Prioritization  
– Analyze variants comparing on-time jobs versus delayed ones. For jobs with high due-date sensitivity, check if they’re frequently queued behind lower-priority tasks.  
– Use a “priority performance” matrix: correlate order priority changes (such as the “High (Urgent)” change events) with the delay magnitudes to quantify missed opportunities.

• Suboptimal Sequencing and Excessive Setup Times  
– From the sequence-dependent setup analysis, identify specific cases where switching between dissimilar jobs significantly increases setup durations.  
– Use variant clustering to show the difference in cumulative setup times for different sequencing strategies and highlight where intelligent batching might reduce setups.

• Starvation of Downstream Resources  
– Trace the triggering events where an overloaded upstream machine causes idle time downstream.  
– Quantify the “idle time” at downstream stations following periods of upstream bottleneck-induced delays.  
– Identify trends in workflow hand-offs and time gaps using process timelines.

• Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels  
– Analyze work-in-progress accumulation by tracking inventory buildup between tasks across time.  
– Compare planned versus actual arrival times at work centers; look for high variability that indicates reactive scheduling decisions.

• Process Mining Evidence  
– Use bottleneck analysis and resource contention heat maps to visually and statistically prove these inefficiencies.  
– Perform variant analysis splitting cases into “on-time” and “late” groups to identify systematic sequenced patterns and resource usage differences.


3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

• Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules  
– Static rules ignore real-time conditions; process mining evidence shows that rules like “First-Come-First-Served” or “Earliest Due Date” do not account for work center congestion or downstream capacity.  
– Analysis of cycle times and resource utilization indicates that high-priority jobs can be blocked by earlier, but less critical, jobs.

• Lack of Real-Time Visibility  
– The absence of a holistic view across work centers is revealed by long queue times and mismatches between forecasted and actual machine states.  
– Process mining dashboards, updated in near-real time, would demonstrate the potential for more dynamic decision-making.

• Inaccurate Task Duration and Setup Estimates  
– Historical performance logs show that planned task durations and setups often differ significantly from actual times.  
– A statistical deviation analysis (looking at variance or Mean Absolute Percentage Error) would quantify these discrepancies.

• Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setup  
– The analysis of setup times reveals that switching between dissimilar jobs increases durations, an aspect that the current scheduling logic fails to address.  
– Mining job sequences and comparing setups demonstrates that similar jobs batched together yield lower overhead.

• Poor Coordination Between Work Centers  
– Timing misalignments and work-in-progress imbalances show that local dispatching rules lead to suboptimal balancing between upstream and downstream resources.  
– Process mining can trace these hand-off delays, evidencing a lack of synchronized scheduling across the shop floor.

• Inadequate Disruption Management  
– Breakdowns and urgent job insertions lead to cascading delays. Analysis shows that rigid scheduling does not adapt well in real time to disruptions.  
– By tagging and analyzing disruption events in the logs, one can differentiate delays due to poor scheduling logic from those inherent to resource capacity issues.

• Differentiating Causality  
– Using clustering and regression on key variables (e.g., machine capacity vs. scheduling delays) helps isolate whether performance issues stem from scheduling logic deficiencies or variable process execution.  
– Process mining trace alignment and conformance checking further separate the impacts of inherent variability versus misaligned scheduling decisions.


4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules  
– Core Logic: Develop multi-criteria dispatching rules that weight several factors:
• Remaining processing time for jobs.
• Due date urgency.
• Order priority.
• Downstream machine load and predicted delays.
• Estimated sequence-dependent setup times mined from historical pairing data.
– Process Mining Insights: Historical logs provide statistical distributions and correlations, enabling dynamic weight assignment. For example, if similar prior setups took 20 versus 40 minutes for different job pairings, the dispatching rule can dynamically choose the sequence minimizing cumulative setup time.
– Addressed Pathologies: Reduces total setup times, minimizes queue times, and better prioritizes urgent jobs by considering the entire network state.
– Expected Impact: Reduction in overall tardiness, lower WIP levels, improved adherence to due dates, and smoother workflow across bottlenecks.

Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Realistic Duration Forecasts  
– Core Logic: Leverage predictive analytics using historical task and setup duration distributions (possibly segmented by operator, job complexity, or machine type) to forecast more realistic completion times. Incorporate predictive maintenance data to foresee potential machine breakdowns.
– Process Mining Insights: Mining the event log’s duration data allows building probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian networks or machine learning regressors) that predict realistic processing times and alert scheduling systems to impending resource downtime.
– Addressed Pathologies: Provides an anticipatory adjustment to schedules before delays occur; reduces the impact of variance between planned and actual durations; prepares contingency buffers for disruptive events.
– Expected Impact: Enhanced schedule reliability, proactive mitigation of bottlenecks, better visibility for due date commitments, and reduced propagation of delays throughout the process network.

Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization through Intelligent Batching  
– Core Logic: Implement a sequencing algorithm that groups similar job orders (based on material, tooling requirements, or finishing operations) to minimize sequence-dependent setup times on bottleneck machines. This might involve a form of dynamic batching or “setup-aware” sequencing integrated with overall scheduling.
– Process Mining Insights: Detailed analysis of historical setup data reveals which job transitions incur high overhead. Clustering techniques can identify “job families” with lower inter-job setup times when processed consecutively.
– Addressed Pathologies: By reducing excessive setup durations, overall processing times decrease. This strategy also prevents frequent small batch disruptions that lead to high variability in processing times.
– Expected Impact: Lower cumulative setup time, improved machine utilization, reduced queued jobs due to faster turnaround times, and a decrease in overall cycle times leading to enhanced on-time delivery performance.


5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

• Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Setup  
– Parameterization: Use process mining outputs (e.g., task duration distributions, routing probabilities, breakdown frequencies, setup time models, machine-specific performance metrics) to build a comprehensive DES.  
– Scenarios: Test under various operational conditions:
• High-load conditions to evaluate capacity under peak demand.
• Frequent disruptions to see how the adaptive strategies respond to breakdowns and urgent orders.
• Mixed job profiles to evaluate the benefits of intelligent batching and enhanced dispatching.
– Objectives: Compare key KPIs such as average tardiness, total WIP, machine utilization ratios, and overall lead times under baseline versus advanced scheduling strategies.

• Framework for Continuous Improvement  
– Real-time Monitoring: Develop dashboards that integrate ongoing MES event streams with process mining analytics—tracking key metrics (e.g., cycle times, queue lengths, setup durations, resource idle times).  
– Automatic Drift Detection: Implement statistical process control (SPC) algorithms to detect shifts or anomalies (e.g., unexpected increases in setup times or delays) that might indicate new inefficiencies.  
– Feedback Loop: Utilize a closed-loop system where simulation outputs and real-world performance data feed into periodic review sessions. These sessions adjust scheduling parameters (e.g., dispatching rule weights, batching criteria) continuously.
– Benchmarking and Conformance Checking: Re-run conformance analysis on live data to ensure the implemented scheduling logic remains aligned with the optimal model discovered during the process mining phase.


Summary

By leveraging detailed MES event logs through process mining, we reconstruct actual job flows, quantify key performance metrics, and diagnose scheduling inefficiencies. The core root causes—static dispatching, misestimated durations, and inflexible handling of sequence-dependent setups—are addressed using advanced, data-driven scheduling strategies: dynamic dispatching rules, predictive scheduling based on realistic processing forecasts, and intelligent batching for setup optimization. Coupled with rigorous discrete-event simulation and continuous monitoring, these approaches pave the way for significantly improved due date adherence, reduced WIP, and overall enhanced resource utilization for Precision Parts Inc.
