The diagram is a swimlane process map for the dispatch of goods, specifically for a computer hardware shop. It is divided into three swimlanes: Logistics, Dispatch of Goods, and Warehouse. The process starts with the 'Ship goods' event in the 'Dispatch of Goods' lane. The first step is to clarify the shipment method. If special handling is required, the process involves checking if insurance is necessary, insuring the parcel if needed, and writing a package label. Offers from logistic companies are obtained, and a logistic company is selected to place the order. The goods are then packaged in the 'Warehouse' lane. If there is a delay of more than 48 hours, the customer is notified. After packaging, shipment paperwork is filled out, and the package is moved to the pickup area, completing the process with the 'Shipment prepared' event. The diagram uses various symbols, including decision points (diamonds), tasks (rectangles), and events (circles), to illustrate the flow and decision-making process in the dispatch of goods.
