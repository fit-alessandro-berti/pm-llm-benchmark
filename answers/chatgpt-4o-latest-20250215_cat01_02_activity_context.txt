### **Justification for Renaming Activities:**
1. **"Verify Documents" → "Initial Document Verification" / "Final Document Verification" / "Physical Document Verification" / "Post-Adjustment Document Check"**  
   - The same activity appears multiple times with different contextual roles.  
   - "Initial Document Verification" is used when documents are first reviewed.  
   - "Final Document Verification" indicates a second review after additional documents are submitted.  
   - "Physical Document Verification" is used for in-person document checks.  
   - "Post-Adjustment Document Check" reflects a re-verification after an account update.

2. **"Call Customer" → "Request Missing Documents" / "Clarify Account Discrepancy" / "Confirm Account Adjustment" / "Recall Customer to Branch"**  
   - "Request Missing Documents" reflects an agent calling a customer to provide additional information.  
   - "Clarify Account Discrepancy" is an outbound call related to an account issue.  
   - "Confirm Account Adjustment" is a follow-up call to validate changes made.  
   - "Recall Customer to Branch" is a call specifically to request the customer return in person.

3. **"Submit Additional" → "Submit Additional Documents"**  
   - The generic name is changed to specify that documents are being submitted.

4. **"Adjust Account" → "Adjust Account Details"**  
   - This name provides clarity that internal account modifications are being performed.

These changes ensure that the activity names clearly differentiate steps based on context, reducing ambiguity in process analysis.
