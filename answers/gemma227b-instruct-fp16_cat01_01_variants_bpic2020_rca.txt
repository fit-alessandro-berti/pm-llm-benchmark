The provided text describes a process where a "Declaration" is submitted and then goes through a series of approvals, ultimately leading to a "Payment Finalized" status.

Here are some potential process-specific and data-specific root causes for performance issues in this scenario:

**Process Specific:**

* **Rejection Rate:** The high occurrence of "Declaration REJECTED" (with a frequency of 4) suggests there are bottlenecks within the "Declaration" step itself. This could be due to:

    * **Incomplete Information:** A "Declaration" may be rejected by BUDGET OWNER if the required information is not available for finalizing the process.

    * **Redundant Approvals:** 

        * **Inefficient Workflow:** If the "Declaration" step is unnecessarily complex or requires too many people to approve, it could lead to delays.
        * **Inefficient Communication:** Delays in communication between the "Submission" stage and the "REJECTED" by "BUDGET OWNER" stage can lead to a higher number of "Rejection" steps.

    * **Lack of Clarity in Approval Criteria:** Without clear guidelines on what constitutes a "valid" "Rejection" from the "BUDGET OWNER", it could lead to inconsistent decisions.

**Data Specific:**

* **Data Quality:**

    * **Missing Information:** Frequent "REJECTED by" could be due to incomplete or inaccurate data in the "Submission" stage.
    * **Inconsistent Data:** If "BUDGET OWNER"s are unclear on what data is acceptable, there might be multiple rejections before a "Submission" reaches the final stage.

    * **Inefficient Data Handoff:** The "Declaration" stage might not be providing the necessary information in a clear or accessible format to the "administration" and "BUDGET OWNER" stages.
* **Missing Information in "Declaration" Process:**

    * If "BUDGET OWNER"s require additional information or details from the "Submission" stage, it can lead to delays in the process.

* **Lack of Automation:** The "Submission" stage might be slow if it relies on manual processes like data entry.

    * **Inefficient Data Review:**

The "Declaration" status may be related to a lack of clarity in the workflow process. 

* **Inefficient Data Transfer:**

The "Submission" stage can be "REJECTED" by "Submission"

It's important to remember that these are just potential root causes. To get a better understanding of the specific reasons for the delays, you would need to investigate the "Submission" process further and understand the reasons behind the "REJECTED" status.

This information is crucial for understanding the performance issues in the "Declaration" process.

Are there any specific details about the process or the data that you can share? For example:

* **What are the typical reasons for "Rejection" in the "Administration" stage?**

* **What kind of data is typically submitted in the "Submission" stage?**

Knowing the answers to these questions will help us determine if the issues are primarily with the data itself, the process of "Rejecting" or "Approving" it, or both.
