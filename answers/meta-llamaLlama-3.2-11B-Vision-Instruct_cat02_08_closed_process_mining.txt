Here are the opposite concepts, and more general concepts, for each of the given process mining concepts:

1. **Automated Process Discovery**:
   - Opposite concept: **Human-Driven Process Definition** (requiring manual effort to define and analyze processes).
   - More general concept: **Process Modeling** (encompassing various methods, including automated discovery, human-driven definition, and hybrid approaches).

2. **Predictive Monitoring**:
   - Opposite concept: **Reactive Monitoring** (focusing on responding to current events rather than predicting future behavior).
   - More general concept: **Process Analytics** (including predictive, reactive, and descriptive analytics techniques to analyze and gain insights from process data).

3. **Bottom-up Discovery**:
   - Opposite concept: **Top-down Modeling** (starting from high-level process goals and working down to detailed process activities).
   - More general concept: **Process Analysis** (encompassing various approaches, including top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid methods to analyze and understand processes).

4. **Process Simulation**:
   - Opposite concept: **Real-World Process Analysis** (focusing on analyzing actual process data rather than simulated scenarios).
   - More general concept: **Process Analysis and Optimization** (including simulation, optimization, and other techniques to analyze and improve processes).

5. **Process Efficiency**:
   - Opposite concept: **Process Optimization for Novelty** (focusing on introducing new processes or innovations rather than optimizing existing ones).
   - More general concept: **Process Innovation and Management** (encompassing various strategies, including efficiency optimization, innovation, and continuous improvement, to manage and enhance processes).

6. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Opposite concept: **Batch Process Analysis** (analyzing process data in batches, rather than in real-time).
   - More general concept: **Process Data Analytics** (including real-time, batch, and other approaches to analyze and extract insights from process data).
