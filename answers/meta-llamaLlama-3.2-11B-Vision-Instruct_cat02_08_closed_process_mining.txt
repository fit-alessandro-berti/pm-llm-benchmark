Here are the proposed opposite concepts, more general concepts, or alternative perspectives for each of the given process mining concepts:

1. **Automated Process Discovery**: 
   * Opposite concept: Manual Process Documentation
   * More general concept: Process Knowledge Extraction
   * Alternative perspective: While automated discovery focuses on automatically creating models from event data, manual documentation involves the explicit and detailed note-taking processes for business processes. This could be more suitable for settings where human expertise or specific, intricate processes are of significant value. Process knowledge extraction encompasses broader methods to gather insights, including automation but also potentially extending to what could be learned through other data sources or inputs beyond just process logs.
   2. **Predictive Monitoring**: 
   * Opposite concept: Reactive Monitoring
   * More general concept: Process Analytics
   * Alternative perspective: Predictive monitoring uses models and data analysis to forecast and prevent potential issues or anomalies. Reactive monitoring occurs when systems or personnel respond to problems and anomalies as they occur. Predominantly, predictive methods are scientifically driven and employ models to forecast future outcomes, making them proactive in prevention of issues. Process analytics is a broader field that can encompass any form of data-driven analysis of processes, including predictive, descriptive, and diagnostic analytics.
   3. **Bottom-up Discovery**: 
   * Opposite concept: Top-Down Discovery or Direct Documentation
   * More general concept: Process Modeling Methodology
   * Alternative perspective: Bottom-up discovery involves analyzing process logs from process execution to rebuild the process. Top-down discovery or direct documentation involves starting with a diagram or process map provided by the organization or through a survey. Process modeling methodology refers to the different methods or approaches for creating process models, including capturing current state, redesigning, or normalizing processes.
   4. **Process Simulation**: 
   * Opposite concept: Process Analysis
   * More general concept: Process Modeling and Analysis
   * Alternative perspective: Process simulation involves the use of computational models to simulate how processes operate or could operate under different conditions. Process analysis focuses on detailed studies of the process to understand it better, optimize it, or improve it. Process modeling and analysis includes all of these activities, prioritizing understanding the dynamics, conditions, and scenarios influencing a process—beyond mere analysis or simulation.
   5. **Process Efficiency**: 
   * Opposite concept: Process Effectiveness
   * More general concept: Process Performance
   * Alternative perspective: Process efficiency often suggests optimizing processes to use minimal resources to achieve a certain output. Process effectiveness measures the processes' achievements in terms of outcome quality and timeliness. Process performance is a broader term encompassing metrics for both efficiency (in terms of costs, resources) and effectiveness (in terms of outcomes or outputs).
   6. **Real-time Monitoring**: 
   * Opposite concept: Batch Processing
   * More general concept: Process Visibility
   * Alternative perspective: Real-time monitoring refers to the capability to track and analyze ongoing processes as events occur. Batch processing involves aggregating data and analyzing it in bulk, typically after the process completion. Process visibility refers to the ability to see and understand processes, including how they operate in real time, and potentially after the fact through analysis.
