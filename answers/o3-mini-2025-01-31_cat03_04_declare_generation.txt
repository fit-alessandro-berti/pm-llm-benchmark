Below is one valid Pythondictionary representation of a DECLARE model for the multidepartment product design and launch process. (Note that there is no single “correct” model – the following is one possible design where we assert, for example, that some activities must occur (existence), some exactly once, and we also define several interactivity relations. In this example we “name” the binary (twoactivity) constraints by a string showing the relation (using arrow or bidirectional arrow notation); in an actual pm4py model these might be encoded in a different way.) 

For example, we assume that:
•Idea Generation (IG) must occur and be the starting activity.
•Design Draft (DD), Technical Feasibility Check (TFC) and Final Launch (FL) must each appear at least once.
•Approval Gate (AG) and Final Launch (FL) are “exactly one” activities.
•If a Design Draft occurs then eventually a Technical Feasibility Check must follow (responded existence, and even an immediate chain is enforced).
•Approval Gate should be followed by Final Launch (response) and – in a stricter “chain” version – immediately so.
•User Testing (UT) and Marketing Plan (MP) are seen as mutually “coexisting.”
•We also include some “alternative” and “nonoccurrence” constraints for illustration.

Explanatory notes:
1. For the unary constraints (existence, absence, exactly_one, init) the keys are individual activities.
2. For binary (or relational) constraints (responded_existence, coexistence, response, precedence, succession, altresponse, altprecedence, altsuccession, chainresponse, chainprecedence, chainsuccession, noncoexistence, nonsuccession, nonchainsuccession) we “name” each rule by a string indicating the relationship. In a real-life implementation you might encode the two activities as a tuple or another dedicated structure.
3. All support and confidence values are set to 1.0 as specified.

This dictionary is one example of how the multidepartment process can be “declared” in pm4py.
