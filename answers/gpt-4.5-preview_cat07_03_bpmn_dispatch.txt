This visualization is a business process diagram that represents the workflow for dispatching goods in a computer hardware shop, split into three swimlanes for clear role delineation: Logistics, Secretary, and Warehouse. Here is a detailed description of the process depicted:

Secretary Tasks:
1. The process initiates from the event: "Ship goods."
2. A gateway indicates that activities related to clarifying the shipment method can start.
3. Clarify shipment method.
4. Check whether special handling is required:
   - If no, proceed directly and get three offers from logistic companies, then select the logistic company and place an order.
   - If yes, check if insurance is required. This step uses customer information to verify the insurance status.
     - If insurance is necessary, ensure the parcel is insured.
     - Independently, always write the package label after insuring.
     - Then the logistics offers process is followed similarly.
5. After finalizing the logistics company selection, the process moves ahead.

Warehouse Tasks:
6. Parallel with the above, the warehouse starts packaging the goods.
7. If the packaging takes longer than 48 hours, notify the customer about the delay.
8. Once packaged, the warehouse fills out the shipment paperwork and moves the package to the pickup area.

Logistics Tasks:
9. The logistics lane only has one explicit activity: "Insure parcel," clearly required if insurance is requested.

End Event:
10. The process finishes with the event "Shipment prepared".

Overall, this diagram clearly shows a detailed workflow from receiving an order to preparing it for shipment, including conditions for exceptional handling (special handling, insurance, delays). The diagram uses standard notations to represent activities, events, gateways (decision points), parallel flows, and data (order details and customer information), clearly assigning tasks to responsible departments.
