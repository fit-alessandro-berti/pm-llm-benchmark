<think>
We are given a list of activities: 
  ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']

 We need to compute the temporal profile for every pair of activities (not necessarily adjacent) that appear in the trace.

 Steps:
 1. We are to consider every pair of activities (X, Y) such that in at least one execution, X is followed by Y (with any number of activities in between?).
    However, note the example: for trace <A,B,C,D> they consider pairs (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), (C,D). 
    So we are to consider every pair of activities that appear in the same trace and that are consecutive in the sequence? 
    But note: the problem says "couples of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution".

    This means: for a given trace, we have a sequence of activities: [a0, a1, a2, ..., an]
    Then the pairs are (a_i, a_j) for every i < j? 

    However, the example: `<A,B,C,D>` considers (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), (C,D). So every pair of two activities that appear in the trace, regardless of being adjacent? 

    But note: the definition says "the times between couples of activities". In the example, they are taking the time between two activities as the time from the first to the next occurrence of the same activity? 

    Actually, the problem states: "the times between couples of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution". 

    This is ambiguous. However, looking at the example: the pairs are (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), (C,D). 
    This suggests that we are to take every pair of two distinct activities that appear in the trace? And then what is the "time" between them? 

    But note: the temporal profile is defined for a pair of activities (X, Y) as the average time between X and Y when they occur in the trace? However, X and Y might not be consecutive.

    The problem says: "the observed time between two activities in a particular execution". 

    How is the time defined? It is the time from the occurrence of the first activity to the occurrence of the second activity? 

    Example: in the trace [A, B, C, D]:
      - For (A, B): time = time from A to B (ignoring what happens in between? just the difference in their positions? but we don't have timestamps)

    However, note: the example temporal profile: 
        {('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600), ('B', 'C'): (3600, 3600)}

    Here, (A,B) and (B,C) are adjacent. But the problem says "not only directly connected, but eventually following each other".

    So we must consider non-adjacent pairs? 

    But how? For example, (A, C) in [A, B, C] would be the time from A to C? 

    Therefore, for a given trace and a pair (X, Y), we should consider every occurrence of X and every occurrence of Y (if X and Y are the same, then we consider consecutive occurrences) and then compute the time between the two? 

    However, the problem states: "in at least one process execution". So we are to consider one execution? But then the example trace <A,B,C,D> considers multiple pairs? 

    Actually, the problem says: "For a given trace ... the pairs ... must be considered". So we are to consider every trace and every pair of activities that appear in the same trace? 

    But note: the temporal profile is defined for a pair of activities (X, Y) as the average time between X and Y when they occur in the same trace? 

    However, the example only shows adjacent pairs. But the definition says "eventually following each other" meaning that we are to consider the entire path from X to Y? 

    How the average and standard deviation are computed?
      - For a fixed pair (X, Y) in a trace, we look at every occurrence of X that is followed by an occurrence of Y (in the same trace) and compute the time between them? Then average those times? 

    But note: the example does not have multiple occurrences. 

    Since we are in a trace (a sequence of activities), each activity occurs exactly once? Then for a pair (X, Y) we have at most one occurrence? 

    However, the problem says "multiple executions". So we have multiple traces? And each trace is a sequence? Then each activity in a trace is unique? 

    But wait: what if the same activity can appear multiple times in a trace? For example, we might have two SS activities? 

    The problem does not specify. But in typical process mining, activities can repeat. 

    Therefore, we must consider:

    For a given pair (X, Y) (with X != Y) that appear in a trace, we look at the trace and find all the pairs of events (e1, e2) such that e1 is an occurrence of X, e2 is an occurrence of Y, and e1 occurs before e2 in the trace. Then we compute the time between e1 and e2 (by time of e2 minus time of e1). Then we average the times for all such pairs? 

    However, the problem says: "the observed time between two activities in a particular execution". So one execution? But then we are aggregating over multiple executions? 

    Actually, the problem says: "in at least one process execution" meaning that we are looking at one execution? But then the example trace <A,B,C,D> has one execution. Then for (A, B) we have one time: from the A to the B. For (A, C) we have one time: from the A to the C. 

    But then how do we compute average and standard deviation? We are to aggregate over multiple executions? 

    The problem states: "Given a positive value `ZETA`, a deviation occurs when the observed time between two activities in a particular execution is either significantly lower than `(AVG - ZETA * STDEV)` or significantly higher than `(AVG + ZETA * STDEV)`."

    And the temporal profile is built from multiple executions? 

    Therefore, we are to aggregate over multiple executions? 

    How the temporal profile is built?
      - For each pair (X, Y) (with X != Y) that appear in any trace (and we have multiple executions), we collect the time for every execution in which both X and Y appear (and in the same trace) and then compute:
          average_time = mean of all the times for (X, Y) pairs from every execution
          standard_deviation = standard deviation of the times for (X, Y) pairs

    But note: the problem says "eventually following each other in at least one process execution" meaning that we consider one execution? But then we are to aggregate over multiple executions? 

    The problem says: "Produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile." and "For each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other)".

    So we are to consider every pair (X, Y) that appears in the same trace (in the same execution) and then aggregate the times from every execution? 

    However, the example only shows adjacent pairs. But the problem says "not only directly connected, but eventually following each other". 

    Therefore, we must consider non-adjacent pairs? 

    But note: in one execution, the trace is a sequence. So for a pair (X, Y) that are not adjacent, we have one time: the distance from the X event to the Y event? 

    How do we compute the time? We need timestamps? 

    The problem does not give timestamps. It only gives the order in the trace. 

    Therefore, we assume that the trace is given as a sequence of activities. We can assign a timestamp to each activity? 

    But the problem does not specify. 

    However, note: the example temporal profile for (A, B) is 86400 seconds (1 day) and for (B, C) is 3600 seconds (1 hour). 

    How did they get these numbers? They must have timestamps. 

    Since the problem does not provide timestamps, we must assume that we are given the raw trace as a list of activities? 

    Actually, the problem does not provide the raw traces? 

    The problem says: "Your task: Produce a Python dictionary ..."

    How are we going to compute the temporal profile without the raw traces? 

    This indicates that the problem is abstract. We are to assume that we have the raw traces? 

    But the problem does not provide the raw traces. 

    Therefore, we must generate a representative example? 

    The problem says: "construct a dictionary that includes a representative subset of these activity pairs, ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps."

    So we are to create an example temporal profile for a set of activities? 

    But note: the problem does not give any data. 

    How can we create a temporal profile without data? 

    We are to assume a set of activities and then assign arbitrary but representative values? 

    The problem says: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt" meaning that we are not to hardcode numbers? 

    But then how? 

    Actually, the problem is ambiguous. 

    Let me re-read: 

    "Your task: Produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile."

    And the scenario says: "Over multiple process executions (traces) ... "

    So we are to assume that we have the traces? 

    But the problem does not provide the traces. 

    Therefore, I think we are to generate a fictional temporal profile that is consistent with a set of activities. 

    How? 

    We are to consider the set of activities: 
      ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']

    And we are to create a dictionary that includes pairs of these activities. 

    We are to make it representative and complex: meaning we should include pairs that are adjacent and non-adjacent? 

    But without actual data, we cannot compute the averages and standard deviations. 

    Therefore, the problem must be to design a function that, given a set of traces (each trace is a list of activity labels), computes the temporal profile? 

    But the problem says: "construct a dictionary", meaning we are to output a dictionary? 

    And the example output is a dictionary with keys being tuples of two activity labels and values being a tuple (average_time, standard_deviation). 

    Without data, we cannot do that. 

    However, note: the problem says "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt" meaning that we are not to hardcode numbers? 

    But then what? 

    I think there is a misunderstanding. The problem is to model the temporal profile as a dictionary, but we are to assume that we have the raw traces? 

    Since the problem does not provide the traces, we are to write a function that computes the temporal profile from traces? 

    But the problem says "construct a dictionary", meaning we are to output a dictionary? 

    Alternatively, the problem might be to create a fictional temporal profile that is consistent with the supply chain? 

    Given the ambiguity, I will assume that we are to write a function that, given a list of traces (each trace is a list of activity labels), computes the temporal profile. 

    However, the problem does not say that. 

    Alternatively, the problem might be to create an example temporal profile for a fixed set of traces? But the traces are not provided. 

    Another possibility: the problem is to design the structure of the temporal profile and then use some example data? 

    But the problem says: "construct a dictionary". 

    I think the intended solution is to write a function that computes the temporal profile from a list of traces. 

    Steps for the function:

    Input: 
      - traces: a list of traces, where each trace is a list of activity labels (strings) representing the sequence of activities in one execution.
      - zeta: a positive value (but the problem does not specify how to compute the average and stdev without data, so we ignore for now? or we use it in the function)

    However, the problem does not specify how to compute the average and stdev because we don't have the time values? 

    The problem states: "the observed time between two activities in a particular execution". 

    How is the time computed? 

    We need to assign timestamps? 

    Without timestamps, we cannot compute the time. 

    Therefore, we must assume that the trace is given as a sequence and we are to assign arbitrary time values for the purpose of this example? 

    But the problem says: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt". 

    This is confusing. 

    After re-thinking, I notice: the problem says "not only directly connected, but eventually following each other". 

    And the example trace <A,B,C,D> is given. 

    How about we assume that the time between two consecutive activities is given? 

    For example, in the trace [A, B, C, D], we have:
      - time(A->B) = 86400
      - time(B->C) = 3600
      - time(C->D) = 7200

    Then the time from A to C would be time(A->B) + time(B->C) = 86400+3600 = 90000.
    And the time from A to D would be 86400+3600+7200 = 194400.

    Then for a pair (A, C) we have two observations in the trace? Actually, one observation: the entire path from A to C? 

    But note: the trace might have multiple occurrences of A and C? 

    Since the trace is a sequence, each activity occurs once? 

    Therefore, for a pair (X, Y) in a trace, we have at most one time: the total time from the occurrence of X to the occurrence of Y? 

    Then for multiple executions, we have multiple time values? 

    How do we aggregate? 

    We will collect for every execution in which both X and Y appear (and in the same trace) the time from the occurrence of X to the occurrence of Y? 

    Then compute the average and standard deviation of that single time? 

    But note: if X and Y appear multiple times in a trace? 

    Example: trace [X, A, Y, X, B, Y] 
      Then we have two pairs: (X at index0 to Y at index2) and (X at index3 to Y at index5)

    So we have two time values. 

    Therefore, the plan:

    Preprocessing: 
      We are given a list of traces. Each trace is a list of activities.

    For each trace:
      We can record the index of each activity? 

    For a fixed pair (X, Y):
      We will traverse the trace and find every occurrence of X and every occurrence of Y that comes after that X? 

      Then for each such (X_i, Y_j) (where X_i is at index i and Y_j at index j and i<j) we compute the time as (timestamp of Y_j - timestamp of X_i). 

      But we don't have timestamps? 

    How do we get timestamps? 

    The problem does not provide them. 

    Therefore, we must assume that the trace is given as a list of activities and we are to assign a timestamp for each activity? 

    But the problem does not specify. 

    Alternatively, we can assume that the time between consecutive activities is given? And then the time from X to Y is the sum of the times between consecutive activities from X to Y? 

    However, the problem does not specify how the time is defined. 

    Given the ambiguity, I will assume that we are given the raw traces with timestamps? 

    But the problem does not provide that. 

    Therefore, I think the problem is flawed. 

    But wait: the problem says "the observed time between two activities in a particular execution" and then the example: 
        For (A, B): 86400 seconds, (B, C): 3600 seconds.

    How did they get these numbers? They must have a way to measure time. 

    Since the problem does not provide timestamps, we cannot compute the temporal profile. 

    However, the problem asks to construct a dictionary. 

    Therefore, I will create a fictional temporal profile for the given set of activities. 

    We will create an example that includes:

    Pairs of activities that are adjacent in the supply chain:

      ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600)   # average time and std dev for SS to OP
      ('OP', 'RC'): (43200, 7200)
      ('RC', 'QI'): (28800, 2400)
      ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 1200)
      ('CA', 'PT'): (7200, 600)
      ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 3600)
      ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 3600)
      ('WS', 'DT'): (3600, 3600)
      ('DT', 'AS'): (14400, 1200)

    And then we also include some non-adjacent pairs to ensure complexity:

      ('SS', 'RC'): (129600, 10800)   # SS to RC: SS->OP + OP->RC
      ('SS', 'QI'): (144000, 12000)   # SS->OP->RC->QI
      ('OP', 'CA'): (64800, 5400)     # OP->RC->QI->CA
      ('RC', 'PT'): (43200, 3600)     # RC->QI->CA->PT
      ('QI', 'WS'): (10800, 900)      # QI->CA->PT->PK->WS: but we only have up to PK in the adjacent? So we break it down? 

    But note: we don't have an activity 'WS' after 'PK' in the adjacent list? We have ('PK','WS'). 

    However, for non-adjacent pairs, we can take the sum of the adjacent times? 

    But the problem says: the time between two activities is the total time from the first to the second? 

    Therefore, we can compute non-adjacent pairs as the sum of the adjacent times? 

    But then the average and std dev for non-adjacent pairs would be the sum of the averages and the sum of the std devs? 

    However, the standard deviation is not additive. For independent steps, the variance is additive. But the steps are sequential and not independent? 

    But for the purpose of this example, we can assume that the time from X to Y is the sum of the times of the consecutive segments? 

    Then:
        average_time(X, Y) = sum( average_time(X, Z) + average_time(Z, Y) ) for every consecutive pair from X to Y? 
        std_dev(X, Y) = sqrt( sum( std_dev(X, Z)^2 + std_dev(Z, Y)^2 ) )? 

    But note: the standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of variances. However, the times might not be independent. 

    But we don't have data to compute the variance for non-adjacent pairs. 

    Therefore, we will only include adjacent pairs in the example? 

    But the problem says "not only directly connected, but eventually following each other". 

    So we must include non-adjacent pairs? 

    How about we only include adjacent pairs? The example in the problem does not show non-adjacent pairs? 

    Actually, the example in the problem says: for trace <A,B,C,D> they consider every pair (i,j) with i<j. 

    Therefore, we must include non-adjacent pairs? 

    Without data, we can only hardcode the values? 

    Given the constraints, I will create a fictional temporal profile that includes non-adjacent pairs by taking the sum of the adjacent times and then adding some random variation? 

    But that would be arbitrary. 

    Alternatively, we can assume that the non-adjacent pairs are not present in the data? Then we don't include them? 

    But the problem says "ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps".

    Therefore, we must include them. 

    I will create a representative set of non-adjacent pairs by taking the sum of the adjacent segments and then adding a fixed variation? 

    For example, for the pair (X, Y) that are two steps apart:

        average_time(X, Y) = average_time(X, Z) + average_time(Z, Y) + epsilon
        std_dev(X, Y) = sqrt( std_dev(X, Z)^2 + std_dev(Z, Y)^2 )   # ignoring epsilon for simplicity

    But then we are not really measuring the variation of the entire path. 

    Given the ambiguity, I will generate a fictional temporal profile for the supply chain activities including both adjacent and non-adjacent pairs. 

    We will create:

    Adjacent pairs (as above) and then non-adjacent pairs by taking the sum of the adjacent times and then adding some random variation? 

    But the problem does not require random variation. It requires an estimated average and standard deviation. 

    How about we assume that the time for a non-adjacent pair is the sum of the times of the consecutive adjacent pairs? And then we set the standard deviation to be the square root of the sum of the squares of the stddevs of the consecutive segments? 

    This is the standard deviation for the sum of independent random variables. 

    However, the activities are sequential and not independent. But we don't have data to argue otherwise. 

    Steps for non-adjacent pairs:

      Let P0 = SS, P1, P2, ..., Pn = DT (for example)

      For a non-adjacent pair (P0, P2): 
          time0 = time(P0, P1) + time(P1, P2)
          average_time(P0, P2) = average_time(P0, P1) + average_time(P1, P2)
          std_dev(P0, P2) = sqrt( std_dev(P0, P1)**2 + std_dev(P1, P2)**2 )

    Similarly for (P0, P3): 
          time0 = time(P0, P1) + time(P1, P2) + time(P2, P3)
          average_time(P0, P3) = average_time(P0, P1) + average_time(P1, P2) + average_time(P2, P3)
          std_dev(P0, P3) = sqrt( std_dev(P0, P1)**2 + std_dev(P1, P2)**2 + std_dev(P2, P3)**2 )

    But note: the example activity sequence: 
        SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS

    We don't have an activity after AS? So we won't consider pairs that go beyond AS? 

    We'll consider pairs within the sequence. 

    We'll create the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) where X and Y are in the set and X != Y, and we have a path from X to Y in the supply chain sequence? 

    But note: the supply chain sequence is fixed. So every activity has a fixed order? 

    Therefore, we can compute the non-adjacent pairs by summing the adjacent ones. 

    However, the problem does not say that the activities are in a fixed sequence without branching? 

    Given the complexity, I will create the temporal profile for the entire set of activities by including every pair (X, Y) that appears in the same trace? 

    But without data, we cannot compute the average and std dev. 

    Therefore, I will create a fictional temporal profile that includes:

      For every activity and every activity that comes before it in the supply chain sequence (i.e., the fixed order), we compute the time as the sum of the adjacent times from the first to the last. 

    But note: the activities are not necessarily visited in the fixed order in every trace? 

    The problem says: "the global supply chain process" and the activities are listed in a fixed order. 

    But in a trace, the activities might not appear in that order? 

    The problem does not specify. 

    Given the ambiguity, I will assume that every trace is the fixed order: 
        ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']

    Then for any two activities (X, Y), if X appears before Y in the fixed order, then the time between X and Y is the sum of the times of the consecutive segments from X to Y. 

    And if there are multiple occurrences, then we aggregate over every occurrence? 

    But the fixed order trace has each activity once. 

    Therefore, for every pair (X, Y) with X before Y in the fixed order, we have one time: the sum of the adjacent times from X to Y. 

    Then the average and std dev for the pair (X, Y) is that single time and zero std dev? 

    But then the std dev would be zero? 

    That is not very representative. 

    Alternatively, we can assume that the times between consecutive activities have a std dev. Then the total std dev is the std dev of the sum which is the square root of the sum of the variances. 

    So:

        Let the fixed order be: [a0, a1, a2, ..., a9]

        For a pair (a_i, a_j) (i<j), the time T = time(a_i, a_i+1) + time(a_i+1, a_i+2) + ... + time(a_j-1, a_j)

        Then:
            average_time(a_i, a_j) = sum_{k=i}^{j-1} average_time(a_k, a_k+1)
            std_dev(a_i, a_j) = sqrt( sum_{k=i}^{j-1} std_dev(a_k, a_k+1)**2 )

    This is because the variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of the variances. 

    But are the times independent? We assume they are. 

    Therefore, we can compute the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) (with X before Y in the fixed order) as described. 

    But note: the problem says "in at least one process execution". If we assume every trace is the fixed order, then we have one time for each pair. 

    Then the average is that time and the std dev is zero? 

    But the problem says "multiple executions". 

    How do we aggregate over multiple executions? 

    We would collect every time for the pair (X, Y) from every execution and then compute the average and std dev. 

    But if every trace is the fixed order, then for a pair (X, Y) that are not consecutive, we have one time per execution. 

    Then the average is the average of these one-time values? And the std dev is the std dev of these one-time values? 

    But then the std dev would be the std dev of the times for the entire path from X to Y across executions? 

    And the average_time(X, Y) = average of the total times (which is the sum of the average times of the consecutive segments) across executions? 

    But note: the consecutive segments might have different times in different executions. 

    Therefore, we cannot separate the time for (X, Y) into the sum of the consecutive segments and then average independently? 

    The total time for the path in one execution is the sum of the times of the consecutive segments in that execution. 

    Then for multiple executions:

        Let T_{exec_i} = t1_i + t2_i + ... + t_{k_i}   [for the path from X to Y]

        Then the average_time = (T1_i + T2_i + ... + Tk_i) / n

        But we don't have the breakdown per segment in the total time? 

    Alternatively, we can consider the entire path as one segment? Then we would have one time per execution. 

    Then the average and std dev would be computed on these one-time values. 

    But then why would we break it down by consecutive segments? 

    Given the complexity, I will assume that we break down the time for the entire path from X to Y (in one execution) into the consecutive segments? 

    But the problem does not require that. 

    I think the intended solution is to compute the average and std dev for the entire path from X to Y (ignoring the breakdown) for every pair (X, Y) that appear in the same trace (in the same execution) and then aggregate across executions. 

    But without data, we cannot. 

    Given the time, I will output a fictional temporal profile for the fixed order of the activities. 

    We will assume that we have multiple executions, and for each execution, the trace is the fixed order. 

    Then for each pair (X, Y) with X before Y, we have one time: the total time from X to Y (which is the sum of the adjacent times from X to Y). 

    Then the average_time(X, Y) = that time, and the std_dev(X, Y) = 0? 

    But that is not interesting. 

    Alternatively, we can assume that the times between consecutive activities have variation, and then the total time has variation that is the sum of the variances of the consecutive segments? 

    But then the average_time(X, Y) is the sum of the average times of the consecutive segments, and the std_dev(X, Y) is the square root of the sum of the std_dev(consecutive segments)**2. 

    This is the same as above. 

    Therefore, I will create the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) (with X before Y) in the fixed order using the above formula. 

    Steps:

      Let activities = ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']

      Precompute the consecutive times for the fixed order:

        consecutive_times = {
            ('SS','OP'): 86400, 
            ('OP','RC'): 43200, 
            ('RC','QI'): 28800, 
            ('QI','CA'): 14400, 
            ('CA','PT'): 7200, 
            ('PT','PK'): 3600, 
            ('PK','WS'): 3600, 
            ('WS','DT'): 3600, 
            ('DT','AS'): 14400
        }

        But note: the problem also might have non-adjacent pairs in the fixed order, but we are only given adjacent in the consecutive_times. 

      Then for any pair (X, Y) with X and Y in the activities and X appears before Y in the fixed order, we can compute:

        total_time = 0
        total_var = 0
        # We need to find the path from X to Y in the fixed order. But the fixed order is contiguous? 

        Actually, the fixed order is a linear sequence. Therefore, the path from X to Y is the consecutive segments from X to Y. 

        Let i = index of X, j = index of Y, with i<j.

        Then the consecutive segments are from index i to i+1, i+1 to i+2, ... , j-1 to j.

        Then:
            average_time(X, Y) = sum_{k=i}^{j-1} consecutive_time( (activities[k], activities[k+1]) ) 
            std_dev(X, Y) = sqrt( sum_{k=i}^{j-1} (std_dev( (activities[k], activities[k+1]) )**2 )

        But we don't have std_dev for the consecutive segments? 

        The problem does not provide them. 

        Therefore, we will assign fictional std_dev for the consecutive segments? 

        Let's assign:

            consecutive_std_dev = {
                ('SS','OP'): 3600, 
                ('OP','RC'): 3600, 
                ('RC','QI'): 2400, 
                ('QI','CA'): 1200, 
                ('CA','PT'): 600, 
                ('PT','PK'): 3600, 
                ('PK','WS'): 3600, 
                ('WS','DT'): 3600, 
                ('DT','AS'): 1200
            }

        Then for a pair (X, Y) that are k steps apart (k = j-i), the std_dev is the square root of the sum of the squares of the consecutive_std_dev for the segments. 

        But note: the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances only if the variables are independent. 

        We assume they are independent. 

    Therefore, we can compute the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) (with X before Y) as described. 

    But note: the problem says "not only directly connected, but eventually following each other", and this includes non-adjacent pairs. 

    We will include every pair (X, Y) where X and Y are in the activities and X appears before Y in the fixed order. 

    However, the problem says "for each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs", and we are assuming the fixed order. 

    But what if in a trace, the activities are not in the fixed order? 

    The problem does not specify. 

    Given the constraints, I will output the temporal profile for the fixed order. 

    Steps for the code:

      activities = ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']

      consecutive_times = { ... as above ... }
      consecutive_std_dev = { ... as above ... }

      temporal_profile = {}

      n = len(activities)
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(i+1, n):
              total_time = 0
              total_var = 0.0
              # the consecutive segments from i to j-1
              for k in range(i, j):
                  segment = (activities[k], activities[k+1])
                  total_time += consecutive_times[segment]
                  total_var += consecutive_std_dev[segment] ** 2

              std_dev = total_var ** 0.5   # square root of total_var

              temporal_profile[(activities[i], activities[j])] = (total_time, std_dev)

      But note: the problem might have pairs that are not consecutive in the fixed order but might appear in the event logs in a different order? 

      We are only including pairs where the fixed order is SS -> ... -> AS. 

      But the problem says "eventually following each other", which in the fixed order means X before Y. 

      However, in a trace, the activities might appear in any order? 

      Given the complexity, we will only include pairs where the first activity is before the second in the fixed order. 

    But wait: the problem says "couples of activities that eventually follow each other", meaning that in the event logs, we see X and then later we see Y. 

    In the fixed order, if we see a pair (Y, X) with Y after X in the fixed order, then that would be a different pair? 

    The problem does not say if the pair (X,Y) is ordered. 

    The keys in the dictionary are tuples of (X,Y) and the example: ('A','B') is different from ('B','A'). 

    But in the fixed order, if X is before Y, then we only consider (X,Y) and not (Y,X). 

    Therefore, we will only include pairs (X,Y) where X is before Y in the fixed order. 

    But note: in a trace, we might see (Y,X) with Y after X in the fixed order? Then that would be the pair (Y,X) and we would include it if Y is before X in the fixed order? 

    But in the fixed order, Y is after X, so we would not include (Y,X) because we only consider X before Y. 

    Therefore, we are missing the pairs where the first activity is after the second in the fixed order? 

    The problem says "follow each other", meaning that X is followed by Y. So the pair (X,Y) means X then Y. 

    Therefore, we only consider (X,Y) for which in the event logs, X occurs and then later Y occurs. 

    But without the event logs, we cannot determine the order. 

    Given the fixed order assumption, we will only consider pairs where the first activity has a lower index than the second in the fixed order. 

    Therefore, the above double loop is for i<j. 

    But note: the fixed order is the order of the activities in the supply chain. 

    However, in a trace, the activities might not appear in the fixed order. 

    Given the complexity, we will output only the pairs that are in the fixed order. 

    This is a substantial limitation. 

    But the problem says "complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps", and the fixed order provides that. 

    Therefore, we will output the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) where X and Y are in the activities and X appears before Y in the fixed order. 

    Let's code accordingly. 

    However, the problem does not specify the fixed order. We are given the list of activities, but not the order. 

    The list of activities is given in the scenario:

        "- Supplier Selection (SS)"
        "- Order Placement (OP)"
        "- Receive Components (RC)"
        "- Quality Inspection (QI)"
        "- Component Assembly (CA)"
        "- Product Testing (PT)"
        "- Packaging (PK)"
        "- Warehouse Storage (WS)"
        "- Distribution (DT)"
        "- After-Sales Support (AS)"

    So the fixed order is: 
        activities = ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']

    We will use this order. 

    Now, we need to define the consecutive_times and consecutive_std_dev for the consecutive segments. 

    We will define:

        consecutive_times = {
            ('SS', 'OP'): 86400,
            ('OP', 'RC'): 43200,
            ('RC', 'QI'): 28800,
            ('QI', 'CA'): 14400,
            ('CA', 'PT'): 7200,
            ('PT', 'PK'): 3600,
            ('PK', 'WS'): 3600,
            ('WS', 'DT'): 3600,
            ('DT', 'AS'): 14400
        }

        consecutive_std_dev = {
            ('SS', 'OP'): 3600,
            ('OP', 'RC'): 3600,
            ('RC', 'QI'): 2400,
            ('QI', 'CA'): 1200,
            ('CA', 'PT'): 600,
            ('PT', 'PK'): 3600,
            ('PK', 'WS'): 3600,
            ('WS', 'DT'): 3600,
            ('DT', 'AS'): 1200
        }

    Then for every pair (i, j) with i<j, we compute:

        total_time = 0
        total_var = 0.0
        for k in range(i, j):
            segment = (activities[k], activities[k+1])
            total_time += consecutive_times[segment]
            total_var += consecutive_std_dev[segment] ** 2

        std_dev = total_var ** 0.5

        temporal_profile[(activities[i], activities[j])] = (total_time, std_dev)

    But note: the consecutive_std_dev dictionary only includes the consecutive segments that are in the fixed order. 

    We have defined all consecutive segments. 

    Let's test with a non-adjacent pair: ('SS','QI')
        i=0, j=2
        segments: k=0: ('SS','OP') -> time=86400, std_dev=3600 -> var=3600^2 = 12960000
                 k=1: ('OP','RC') -> time=43200, std_dev=3600 -> var=12960000
        total_time = 86400+43200 = 129600
        total_var = 12960000 + 12960000 = 25920000
        std_dev = sqrt(25920000) = 5091.176  (approximately)

    But we want to represent it nicely? We are not to hardcode numbers? 

    We will compute it in the code. 

    However, the problem says: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt", meaning that we are to not hardcode the numbers in the prompt? 

    But we are writing the code to compute them. 

    The problem also says: "the values should be tuples of (average_time, standard_deviation)", so we will output the numbers. 

    Therefore, we will write a function that computes the temporal profile for the fixed order. 

    But the problem does not require a function? It requires a dictionary. 

    Given the instructions, I will write the code to produce the dictionary for the fixed order. 

    However, the problem says: "construct a dictionary", so we will output the dictionary. 

    But note: the problem says "in the event logs", but we are not given the event logs. 

    Therefore, we are outputting the dictionary for the fixed order as an example. 

    We will output the dictionary for every pair (X, Y) with X and Y in the fixed order and X before Y. 

    This will be a large dictionary. 

    We will do it. 

    Let's code accordingly. 

    But note: the problem might have activity pairs that are not in the fixed order? 

    We are only including the ones in the fixed order with X before Y. 

    This is the best we can do. 

    We will now write the code to compute the temporal profile. 

    However, the problem does not specify the consecutive times and std_dev. 

    We are to create a representative example. 

    Therefore, we will use the consecutive times and std_dev that we defined above. 

    We will now generate the dictionary. 

    Note: the activities list is fixed. 

    We'll do:

        activities = ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']

        consecutive_times = { ... }
        consecutive_std_dev = { ... }

        temporal_profile = {}
        n = len(activities)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                total_time = 0
                total_var = 0.0
                for k in range(i, j):
                    seg = (activities[k], activities[k+1])
                    total_time += consecutive_times[seg]
                    total_var += consecutive_std_dev[seg] ** 2
                std_dev = total_var ** 0.5
                temporal_profile[(activities[i], activities[j])] = (total_time, std_dev)

    But note: the standard deviation might be an integer? We will leave it as float.

    However, the example in the problem has integers. 

    We will output the numbers as computed. 

    Let's hope the problem accepts this. 

    We will now write the code accordingly. 

    But note: the problem says "not only directly connected, but eventually following each other", and we are including every pair (X,Y) with X before Y in the fixed order. 

    This meets the requirement. 

    We will output the dictionary. 

    However, the problem does not specify the consecutive times and std_dev. 

    We are free to choose. 

    We will choose the ones we defined. 

    Final code:

</think>

To solve this problem, we need to construct a temporal profile for a given set of activities in a supply chain process. The temporal profile is a dictionary where each key is a pair of activities (tuple of two strings), and the value is another tuple representing the average time and standard deviation of the time between these activities when they appear in sequence. The solution involves calculating these values based on the order of activities in the supply chain and aggregating times for non-adjacent activities by summing the times of consecutive segments.

### Approach
1. **Define Consecutive Times and Standard Deviations**: We start by defining the average time and standard deviation for each consecutive pair of activities in the fixed order of the supply chain process. This order is derived from the problem description: `['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']`.

2. **Generate All Activity Pairs**: For each activity in the list, we consider all subsequent activities (i.e., every pair `(X, Y)` where `X` appears before `Y` in the fixed order). This ensures we cover both adjacent and non-adjacent pairs.

3. **Calculate Total Time and Standard Deviation**: For each pair `(X, Y)`, the total time is the sum of the times of all consecutive segments from `X` to `Y`. The standard deviation is computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard deviations of these segments, assuming the segments are independent.

4. **Construct the Temporal Profile**: Populate the dictionary with each pair `(X, Y)` and their computed (average time, standard deviation) tuples.

### Solution Code
```python
activities = ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS']

consecutive_times = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): 86400,
    ('OP', 'RC'): 43200,
    ('RC', 'QI'): 28800,
    ('QI', 'CA'): 14400,
    ('CA', 'PT'): 7200,
    ('PT', 'PK'): 3600,
    ('PK', 'WS'): 3600,
    ('WS', 'DT'): 3600,
    ('DT', 'AS'): 14400
}

consecutive_std_dev = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): 3600,
    ('OP', 'RC'): 3600,
    ('RC', 'QI'): 2400,
    ('QI', 'CA'): 1200,
    ('CA', 'PT'): 600,
    ('PT', 'PK'): 3600,
    ('PK', 'WS'): 3600,
    ('WS', 'DT'): 3600,
    ('DT', 'AS'): 1200
}

temporal_profile = {}
n = len(activities)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        total_time = 0
        total_var = 0.0
        for k in range(i, j):
            seg = (activities[k], activities[k + 1])
            total_time += consecutive_times[seg]
            total_var += consecutive_std_dev[seg] ** 2
        std_dev = total_var ** 0.5
        temporal_profile[(activities[i], activities[j])] = (total_time, std_dev)

print(temporal_profile)
```

### Explanation
1. **Activity Order**: The activities are ordered as per the supply chain process: `SS` (Supplier Selection), `OP` (Order Placement), `RC` (Receive Components), `QI` (Quality Inspection), `CA` (Component Assembly), `PT` (Product Testing), `PK` (Packaging), `WS` (Warehouse Storage), `DT` (Distribution), and `AS` (After-Sales Support).

2. **Consecutive Segments**: For each consecutive pair of activities in this order, we define the average time and standard deviation. For example, the time from `SS` to `OP` is 86400 seconds (1 day) with a standard deviation of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

3. **Non-Adjacent Pairs**: For pairs of activities that are not adjacent, the total time is computed by summing the times of all consecutive segments between them. For instance, the time from `SS` to `QI` is the sum of the time from `SS` to `OP` and `OP` to `RC`, resulting in 86400 + 43200 = 129600 seconds. The standard deviation for this pair is the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard deviations of these segments.

4. **Output**: The temporal profile dictionary includes all possible pairs of activities where the first activity appears before the second in the fixed order. Each entry provides the average time and standard deviation for the time between these activities.

This approach efficiently captures the temporal relationships between all pairs of activities in the supply chain process, providing a comprehensive temporal profile that accounts for both direct and indirect dependencies.
