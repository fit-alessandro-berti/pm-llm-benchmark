This is a swimlane flowchart (BPMN-like) showing the process for preparing a shipment. The lanes represent roles/areas: Logistics (top), Secretary (middle), and Warehouse (bottom). Key elements and the flow are:

- Start (Ship goods).
- The process splits: one thread goes to the Secretary who “Clarify shipment method.”
  - Decision: “Special handling?”  
    - If yes, the Secretary “Get 3 offers from logistic companies”  “Select logistic company and place order.”
    - If no, the flow continues to checking insurance.
- The Secretary checks customer/order data (“Check if insurance is required”) using customer information and order details.
  - If insurance is required, an action in the Logistics lane “Insure parcel” is performed, then flow continues.
  - In any case the Secretary then “Write package label.”
- The Warehouse thread: after the initial split the Warehouse “Package goods.”
  - A timer of 48 hours is shown; if packaging is delayed the Warehouse “Notify customer about delay.”
  - Once packaged, the Warehouse flow rejoins with the Secretary/logistics path.
- After the logistics selection/labeling and packaging activities converge, there is a synchronization that leads to the Secretary/Warehouse “Fill out shipment paperwork,” then “Move package to pickup area.”
- End event: “Shipment prepared.”

Decision and synchronization symbols (exclusive/parallel gateways) are used to model branching (special handling, insurance required) and joining parallel flows (packaging and paperwork/logistics must both finish). Overall the diagram captures actor responsibilities, conditional branches (insurance, special handling), a timeout notification for delays, and the final paperwork + move-to-pickup steps to complete shipment preparation.
