# Analysis and Revised Event Log

## 1. Activities Appearing Multiple Times

I've identified three activities that recur within cases and carry different contextual meanings:

- **Verify Documents** (appears 2-3 times per case)
- **Call Customer** (appears 1-2 times per case)
- **Adjust Account** (appears in some cases)

---

## 2. Contextual Analysis and Renaming Rationale

### **Verify Documents**
| Occurrence | Context | Renamed Activity |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| First occurrence | Initial identity verification when request first arrives | **Verify Documents - Initial Check** |
| Subsequent occurrences | Re-verification after missing information is provided or after account adjustments | **Verify Documents - Recheck** |

**Rationale:** The first verification is gatekeeping (determining what's missing), while subsequent verifications are validation steps (confirming completeness after remediation).

---

### **Call Customer**
| Occurrence | Context | Renamed Activity |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Outbound calls requesting information/clarification | Agent initiates contact to request missing items or clarify details | **Call Customer - Request Information** |
| Outbound calls for confirmation/follow-up | Agent initiates contact to confirm actions or notify of changes | **Call Customer - Confirm Action** |
| Inbound recall due to absence | Agent calls to bring customer back (e.g., customer stepped out) | **Call Customer - Recall** |

**Rationale:** The intent differs: soliciting input, confirming outcomes, or logistical follow-up.

---

### **Adjust Account**
| Occurrence | Context | Renamed Activity |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Internal correction | Back office adjusts account details based on new information or clarification from call | **Adjust Account - Correct Details** |

**Rationale:** While "Adjust Account" appears only once per case, it could potentially recur. The naming specifies the purpose (correcting vs. other potential adjustments).

## 4. Justification Summary

| Original Activity | Renamed Variants | Contextual Clues |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Verify Documents** | • Initial Check<br>• Recheck | Timing (first vs. after remediation), outcomes (identifying gaps vs. confirming completeness), sequencing |
| **Call Customer** | • Request Information<br>• Confirm Action<br>• Recall | Purpose of call (soliciting data, confirming changes, retrieving customer), agent intent, temporal position |
| **Adjust Account** | • Correct Details | Trigger (post-clarification correction), timing (follows Call Customer), resource (BackOfficeAgent only) |
| **Submit Additional** | Renamed for clarity | One-time customer action; renamed to emphasize it's documentation submission, not a verification step |

These disambiguations enable better process mining, clearer workflow documentation, and more accurate SLA tracking for each distinct activity variant.
