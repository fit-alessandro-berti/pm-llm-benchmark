### Anomalies in the DECLARE Model

1. **Conflict in `responded_existence`:**  
   - Rule: Evaluation (`E`) should follow Assignment (`A`), but it also implicitly requires evaluations to occur, which could clash with other rules. 

2. **Contradiction in `precedence`:**  
   - Rule: Claim Closing (`C`) should follow Claim Receiving (`R`), overriding other sequence requirements such as `N` and `P` which logically precede closing based on process flow.

3. **Contradiction in `noncoexistence`:**  
   - Rule: Evaluation (`E`) and Closing (`C`) should not coexist, but this conflicts with the process flow where evaluation must occur before closing.

4. **Existence of closing (`C`) without complete preceding steps in `existence`:**  
   - Rule only supports the existence of `C` without specifying necessary preceding activities (`P` and `N`).

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements:**  
   - There may have been a misalignment or misunderstanding of the correct order and dependencies among claim activities, leading to logical inconsistencies.

2. **Policy Changes Not Reflecting Uniformly:**  
   - Over time, incremental modifications to policies may not have been uniformly reflected across all components of the DECLARE model.

3. **Technical Issues or Incomplete Data:**  
   - Errors in encoding business logic into the DECLARE constraints could stem from technical glitches or incomplete insights during model creation.

4. **Pressure for Quick Claims Processing:**  
   - Organizational pressures to expedite claim handling might have led to constraints allowing the skipping of necessary steps like Evaluation and Notification.

### SQL Verification Approaches

#### 1. Find Claims Closed Without Evaluation:
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce1
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce2
ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'E'
WHERE ce1.activity = 'C' AND ce2.event_id IS NULL;
```

#### 2. Trace Evaluation and Closing Coexistence:
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2
ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
GROUP BY ce1.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce1.activity) > 1 AND COUNT(DISTINCT ce2.activity) > 1;
```

#### 3. Ensure Evaluation Corresponds with Assigned Adjusters:
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN adjusters a ON a.name = ce.resource
WHERE ce.activity = 'E' AND ce.resource IS NULL;
```

These queries help determine whether the anomalies present in the DECLARE constraints actually manifest in practice, thereby supporting the verification and potential rectification of the business process model.
