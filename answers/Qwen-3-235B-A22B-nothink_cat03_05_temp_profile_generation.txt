Here is a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the described global supply chain process. It includes a representative and realistic subset of activity pairs that follow each other eventually (not necessarily directly) in multiple traces. For each pair, an estimated **average time** and **standard deviation** are provided in seconds, based on typical durations in such supply chain operations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 14400),         # Supplier Selection -> Order Placement (~1 day ± 4h)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (432000, 86400),        # Supplier Selection -> Receive Components (~5 days ± 1 day)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (345600, 43200),        # Order Placement -> Receive Components (~4 days ± 12h)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 3600),           # Receive Components -> Quality Inspection (~2h ± 1h)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 7200),          # Quality Inspection -> Component Assembly (~4h ± 2h)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 21600),         # Component Assembly -> Product Testing (~1 day ± 6h)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (10800, 3600),          # Product Testing -> Packaging (~3h ± 1h)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600),           # Packaging -> Warehouse Storage (~2h ± 1h)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 36000),        # Warehouse Storage -> Distribution (~2 days ± 10h)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 43200),         # Distribution -> After-Sales Support (~1 day ± 12h)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (604800, 172800),       # Supplier Selection -> Product Testing (~1 week ± 2 days)
    ('OP', 'PK'): (432000, 86400),        # Order Placement -> Packaging (~5 days ± 1 day)
    ('QI', 'WS'): (172800, 43200),        # Quality Inspection -> Warehouse Storage (~2 days ± 1 day)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),        # Component Assembly -> Distribution (~3 days ± 1 day)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (259200, 86400),        # Packaging -> After-Sales Support (~3 days ± 1 day)
    ('SS', 'AS'): (777600, 172800)        # Supplier Selection -> After-Sales Support (~9 days ± 2 days)
}
```

### Notes:
- **Time units** are in seconds (e.g., 86400 = 1 day, 3600 = 1 hour).
- The standard deviations reflect variability in logistics, production, and support operations.
- The pairs are chosen to reflect both **immediate** and **indirect** causal relationships across the supply chain.
- The profile includes a variety of **temporal granularities**, from hours to days, depending on the activity.
- This model can be used for **anomaly detection** by comparing actual durations between events to the `(AVG ± ZETA * STDEV)` thresholds.

Let me know if you'd like to generate a version with more or fewer activity pairs, or integrate this profile into an anomaly detection system.
