Business-story of the diagram  
--------------------------------  
A customer asks for a product or service.  The company’s order-to-cash sub-process shown here has one goal: decide whether the request can be accepted, and if yes, calculate the price/delivery date, obtain any mandatory internal sign-off and finally tell the customer the good (or bad) news.  
The flow is built as a “straight-through” backbone with two nested decision layers:

1. “What kind of request did we receive?” – this sets up two completely different qualification tracks.  
2. “Do we need a manager to sign this off?” – a second layer that can be triggered for both tracks and may force a loop-back if the manager says no.

Each element is interpreted below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed walk-through
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Start Event – “Receive Customer Request”  
   Any channel (mail, web form, sales rep…) is assumed to create the same token in the process engine.

2. Task A – “Receive Customer Request” (data capture)  
   Clerk logs the enquiry, opens a case file and types the minimum header data (customer, wanted product, qty, required date, special instructions).  
   One attribute that must be entered is Request Type = {Standard, Custom}.

3. XOR Gateway – “Check Request Type”  
   Exclusive choice: exactly one token leaves the gateway.  
   The value of Request Type is evaluated; no human task here, just a rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PATH 1 – Standard Request ( 70 % of cases)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
   Automatic/clerical checks against published catalogue: part number exists, price list is valid, minimum order quantity is met, customer is not blocked, etc.  
   If validation fails the request is cancelled (not shown in the fragment), otherwise the token moves on.

5. AND-gateway – “Run Parallel Checks”  
   Parallel gateway: one token becomes two tokens that race in parallel.  
   It is NOT a decision; both branches must complete before the process can continue (join behaviour).

   5a. Task C1 – “Credit Check”  
       Call to credit bureau + internal rating; result = { PASS, FAIL } stored in case data.

   5b. Task C2 – “Inventory Check”  
       ATP (available-to-promise) inquiry; result = { IN-STOCK, SHORTAGE } and earliest shipment date.

   Join (implicit in the diagram) – the gateway waits until both tokens arrive; only then it creates one token again.  
   Business meaning: we are not allowed to promise a delivery date until we know BOTH that the customer can pay and that we can ship.

6. Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
   Uses inventory result (stock or promised make-date), transport zone, calendar and requested date.  
   Produces “Confirmed delivery date” and standard list price.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PATH 2 – Custom Request
--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
   Engineers estimate technical complexity, check tool availability, regulatory constraints, cost of new BOM items, etc.  
   Output = Feasible {Yes, No} plus rough cost add-on.

5. XOR-gateway – “Is Customization Feasible?”  
   Decision based on the feasibility flag.

   6a. Feasible = Yes  Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
       Engineer builds a quotation with non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost, premium price and extended lead-time.  
       Data objects: Quotation PDF, Price, Lead-time.

   6b. Feasible = No  Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice”  direct to End Event.  
       Token leaves the sub-process; customer receives a polite “sorry, we cannot do it” e-mail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Convergence – both tracks meet again
--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. XOR-gateway – “Is Approval Needed?”  
   Rule-set examples that set the flag to “Yes”:  
   – Order value > 50 k€  
   – Credit check failed but overridden (manual review)  
   – Custom quotation with margin < 15 %  
   – Any custom request (some companies simply insist on a manager signature).  

   If none of the rules fire the token bypasses approval and jumps straight to “Generate Final Invoice”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Approval loop (can be entered from both tracks)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”  
   A sales manager opens the case, sees price, margin, customer history and the feasibility file (if custom).  
   Outcome = { Approved, Rejected }.

9. XOR-gateway – “Is Approval Granted?”  

   9a. Approved  forward to Task G.  

   9b. Rejected  Task H – “Re-evaluate Conditions”  
       The rejection must be motivated (e.g. lower price, change specs, find alternative material).  
       The diagram shows a loop-back:  
       – If the running token came from the Standard path it is sent back to Task D (“Calculate Delivery Date”) with new conditions (e.g. different quantity, longer lead-time).  
       – If the running token came from the Custom path it is sent back to Task E1 (“Prepare Custom Quotation”) so the engineer can change the offer.  
       The loop may iterate several times, but after a configured maximum (say 3) the case is automatically cancelled to prevent endless cycles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Final common steps
--------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Task G – “Generate Final Invoice” (or Sales Order)  
    All financial data are now fixed; the ERP system creates the order/invoice record and reserves stock or opens a production order.

11. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
    E-mail + PDF with order number, price, confirmed delivery date, tracking link.

12. End Event – process instance ends; the order moves to fulfilment (warehousing, shipping, …) which is outside this diagram.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Key differences Standard vs. Custom
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard  
- Mostly automatic, rule-driven, no engineering effort.  
- Lead-time taken from existing inventory or master-schedule.  
- Price = catalogue price scale.

Custom  
- Engineering manual task (feasibility) is mandatory.  
- Quotation is one-off and may contain NRE.  
- Every custom quotation is subject to extra risk, therefore approval is far more likely to be required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Approval & rework conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Approval is not tied to the path but to business rules that look at value, margin, credit and strategic importance.  
Rework is only possible when approval is withheld; the loop forces the case back to the last calculative task so numbers can be adapted without re-entering feasibility or validation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
End-to-end outcome
The process guarantees that:  
- Every request is either rejected with an explanation or accepted with a firm price and delivery date.  
- Financial risk is controlled (credit check + manager override).  
- Engineering risk is controlled (feasibility gate).  
- Customer receives one consistent confirmation, automatically generated after all gates are passed.
