To identify the main differences between the process variants of the protected and unprotected groups, we need to analyze both the frequency and performance (execution time) of the process variants. Here are some key observations:

### Frequency Differences

1. **Rejection Rates**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of rejections at earlier stages. For example:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a frequency of 484 for the protected group.
     - The unprotected group has a lower frequency of 365 for the same process variant.
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of rejections after more extensive screening:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a frequency of 2490 for the unprotected group.
     - The protected group has a frequency of 366 for the same process variant.

2. **Extensive Screening**:
   - The protected group undergoes extensive screening more frequently before rejection:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a frequency of 793 for the protected group.
     - The unprotected group has a frequency of 1022 for the same process variant.

3. **Tenant Cancellation**:
   - The protected group has fewer instances of tenants canceling after moving in compared to the unprotected group. For example:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" has a frequency of 10 for the protected group.
     - The unprotected group has a frequency of 268 for the same process variant.

### Performance (Execution Time) Differences

1. **Rejection Times**:
   - The protected group generally takes longer to reject prospective tenants:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant" takes 89999.306 for the protected group.
     - The unprotected group takes 80002.688 for the same process variant.
   - The unprotected group has shorter execution times for rejections after extensive screening:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" takes 480013.530 for the unprotected group.
     - The protected group takes 540011.977 for the same process variant.

2. **Tenant Cancellation Times**:
   - The protected group has longer execution times for processes leading to tenant cancellation:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" takes 720057.800 for the protected group.
     - The unprotected group takes 640003.769 for the same process variant.

3. **Extensive Screening and Eviction**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency and longer execution times for processes involving extensive screening and eviction:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant" has a frequency of 6 and takes 990084.833 for the protected group.
     - This process variant is not present in the unprotected group.

### Summary of Unfair Differences

1. **Higher Rejection Rates at Earlier Stages for Protected Group**:
   - The protected group is rejected more frequently at earlier stages compared to the unprotected group.

2. **Longer Execution Times for Protected Group**:
   - The protected group generally experiences longer execution times for similar process variants, indicating potential delays or more stringent screening processes.

3. **More Frequent Extensive Screening for Protected Group**:
   - The protected group undergoes extensive screening more frequently before rejection, suggesting a higher level of scrutiny.

4. **Fewer Instances of Tenant Cancellation for Protected Group**:
   - The protected group has fewer instances of tenants canceling after moving in, which could indicate stricter screening leading to fewer successful tenancies.

These differences suggest potential biases in the screening and rejection processes, with the protected group facing more stringent and time-consuming procedures.
