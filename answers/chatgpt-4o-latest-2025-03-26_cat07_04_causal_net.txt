This visualization represents a **process model**—specifically a **Petri net** used to model workflow or business processes. The model captures tasks and their logical relationships (e.g., sequence, parallelism, decision points). It includes a **legend** at the bottom right showing control-flow split and join types.

### Key Components:

#### **Main Process Flow (top-left to top-right)**
- The process starts at **a (register request)** and ends at **z (end)**.
- There are multiple tasks (represented by labeled boxes):
  - **b**: examine thoroughly
  - **c**: examine casually
  - **d**: check ticket
  - **e**: decide
  - **f**: reinitiate request
  - **g**: pay compensation
  - **h**: reject request
- Each box (transition) is connected by **places** (circles), forming the Petri net.
- These places represent the conditions required for transitions to fire (to start executing).

### **Control Logic/Structure**
- **XOR-split/join**, **AND-split/join**, and **OR-split/join** patterns define branching and merging paths.
  - For example:
    - After **a**, the path can branch into multiple subprocesses like **b**, **c**, or **d**, following splitting logic.
    - These subprocesses eventually reconverge at **e (decide)**.
    - **e** connects to **g (pay compensation)** and **h (reject request)**, which lead to the final state **z (end)**.
- Cycles/loops are supported:
  - From **e or other states to f (reinitiate request)** which connects back to earlier steps, enabling process iteration.

### **Legend (bottom right)**
Explains the gate types:
- **XOR-split**: Only one outgoing path is taken.
- **AND-split**: All outgoing paths execute in parallel.
- **OR-split**: One or more outgoing paths may be taken.
- Corresponding **joins** define how concurrent paths merge:
  - **XOR-join, AND-join, OR-join**.

### Summary:
This is a Petri net-based process model that outlines a decision workflow from registering a request through various examination and decision steps, possibly retrying, and finally ending in either payment or rejection of the request. The use of control-flow patterns models complex, real-world decisions and iterations in business logic.
