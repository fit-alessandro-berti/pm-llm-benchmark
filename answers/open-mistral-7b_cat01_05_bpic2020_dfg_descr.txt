Based on the provided data, it appears that the process involves several stages for the approval and handling of a declaration, which may be related to an expense claim or a document for some other purpose. Here's a general description of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The declaration is reviewed by a supervisor and, if approved, advances to the next stage. If rejected, the declaration returns to the employee for modification.
3. If the declaration is approved by the supervisor, it moves to the administration department for further approval (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION). If rejected, the declaration returns to the employee for modification.
4. If the declaration is approved by the administration department, it advances to the budget owner for approval (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER). If rejected, the declaration returns to the administration department for further action.
5. If the declaration is approved by the budget owner, it moves back to the supervisor for the final approval (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR). If rejected, the declaration returns to the budget owner for further action.
6. Once the declaration is final approved by the supervisor, a request for payment is made (Request Payment).
7. The payment is handled (Payment Handled) and the declaration process is complete.

There are also parallel paths in the process for cases where the declaration is rejected at certain stages. For example, if the declaration is rejected by the supervisor, it can return to the employee for modification (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE). Similarly, if the declaration is rejected by the budget owner or pre-approver, it can return to the employee (Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

The data also indicates that certain actions are taken less frequently, such as the declaration being saved by the employee (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE). Additionally, there are some unusual cases, such as a declaration being rejected by a missing entity (Declaration REJECTED by MISSING). The meaning of "missing" in this context is not clear from the data provided.
