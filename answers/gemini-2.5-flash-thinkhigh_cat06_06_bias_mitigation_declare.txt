Here is the updated DECLARE model with constraints designed to mitigate bias in the loan application process, along with a rationale for each addition.

```python
declare_model = {

        # NEW: Introduce activities for bias mitigation
        "CheckApplicantDemographics": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ApproveLoan": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "RejectLoan": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},

    },
    "response": {

### Explanation of Added Constraints to Mitigate Bias:

1.  **`existence` for New Activities (`CheckApplicantDemographics`, `BiasMitigationReview`, `ApproveLoan`, `RejectLoan`):**
    *   **Rationale:** These activities are introduced to explicitly define steps within the process that relate to sensitive information and bias mitigation. Their inclusion in `existence` signifies that these capabilities are part of the defined process model and can occur in a trace. `ApproveLoan` and `RejectLoan` are introduced as specific decision outcomes that need to be governed by bias constraints, acting as more granular `FinalDecision` activities.

2.  **`coexistence`: `CheckApplicantDemographics` with `BiasMitigationReview`:**
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint enforces that if the process includes `CheckApplicantDemographics` (i.e., information like applicant race, gender, or age is considered), then a `BiasMitigationReview` activity *must also occur* within the same process instance. This ensures that the presence of sensitive data triggers a corresponding fairness check, preventing its unchecked influence.

3.  **`response`: `CheckApplicantDemographics` to `BiasMitigationReview`:**
    *   **Rationale:** Building on the `coexistence` constraint, this `response` rule specifies the ordering: `BiasMitigationReview` must occur *after* `CheckApplicantDemographics`. This ensures that the bias review is a direct consequence of or a step following the examination of sensitive demographic data.

4.  **`response`: `BiasMitigationReview` to `ApproveLoan` and `RejectLoan`:**
    *   **Rationale:** These two constraints establish `BiasMitigationReview` as a mandatory prerequisite for any loan decision (`ApproveLoan` or `RejectLoan`). By requiring that these decisions can only occur *after* the `BiasMitigationReview` has been performed, the model ensures that fairness considerations are integrated directly into the decision-making pipeline, regardless of whether sensitive demographics were explicitly checked.

5.  **`nonsuccession`: `CheckApplicantDemographics` to `RejectLoan`:**
    *   **Rationale:** This is a strong constraint designed to prevent immediate, potentially biased, rejections. It explicitly forbids a `RejectLoan` decision from directly following `CheckApplicantDemographics`. This forces the process to include intermediate steps (like the `BiasMitigationReview`) before a negative outcome can be reached, thereby mitigating the risk of direct discrimination based on sensitive attributes.

These added constraints collectively work to reduce bias by:
*   Ensuring that sensitive attribute checks are always followed by a dedicated review for fairness.
*   Making the bias mitigation review a mandatory prerequisite for any final loan decision.
*   Prohibiting "shortcut" rejections that might be influenced by sensitive demographic information without proper due diligence.
