This Python script showcases how one might construct a DuckDB SQL query that adheres to the requirements outlined in the benchmark prompt. The example creates a small dataset, converts it into a DuckDB table, and runs a complex query to extract process mining insights, specifically focusing on identifying and filtering cases by their top K process variants. Adjustments such as the value of `K` or the example data can be made according to specific needs or testing scenarios.
