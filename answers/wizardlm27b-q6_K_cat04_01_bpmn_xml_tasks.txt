 The process model described in the BPMN XML snippet consists of several tasks. Here is a list of the tasks based on the `id` attributes, which often correspond to task names or identifiers in BPMN models:

1. Task with id `idd371ddf5-0e93-4afa-bd26-49c2c4bc293e`
2. Task with id `idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2`
3. Task with id `id47439984-1040-47c3-994b-2a70fb880ee4`
4. Task with id `id34fba6ea-bbb7-47b7-94a8-3417ede3ceef`
5. Task with id `id25fcead3-d54b-47a1-b9dc-5ac5df8a31db`
6. Task with id `id3152b404-1b39-4c61-bff7-1e4e507f627a`
7. Task with id `idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b`
8. Task with id `id3fe498e9-097b-4628-96b0-639beba726c7`
9. Task with id `id12442c46-240c-4ef8-b16c-249cb1e050b6` (Note: This task is a target for multiple sequence flows, indicating it might be the end or final task in the process.)
10. Task with id `idf3264316-df43-4e89-96d6-af7e56e8f3d3`
11. Task with id `idd401aa5b-8c47-4ee7-a629-375e3f4270b4`
12. Task with id `idde522380c-6a5f-4483-b6b2-13869776e4d5`
13. Task with id `id70cba5cf-d9af-4bd9-bc9f-7906c7b9b8d8`
14. Task with id `id76a2f4f4-7e3a-4d2c-bf79-c18f157a9f7b` (Note: This task is a start event, but it is also considered part of the process as it marks the beginning of the flow.)

Please note that in BPMN, a "start event" (like `id76a2f4f4-7e3a-4d2c-bf79-c18f157a9f7b`) is not exactly a task, but it initiates the process. Similarly, an "end event" (not present in the provided snippet) would mark the end of the process. The tasks listed above are the activities that occur between the start and end events.
