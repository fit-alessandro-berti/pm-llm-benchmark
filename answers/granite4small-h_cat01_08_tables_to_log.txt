# Process Mining Event Log

## Assumptions Made:
1. **Case ID** is derived from `order_id` as per task requirements.
2. Activities are named logically based on table and context associations.
3. For multiple line items within an order, separate "Items Picked" events are created for each item, preserving their individual timestamps to maintain process granularity.
4. In the case of orders split into multiple deliveries (`order_id` 1002), each delivery record is treated as a separate event sequence starting from dispatch until arrival.
5. Payments directly correlate with invoices, so "Payment Received" activities use invoice IDs for traceability.
