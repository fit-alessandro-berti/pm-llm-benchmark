### Analysis of Event Log

#### 1. Normative Rule Violations

**Case 1:**
- **No Violations:** The sequence of activities follows the strict normative rules:
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.

**Case 2:**
- **Violations:**
  - **Ordering Rule Violation:** The Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check. This is a direct violation of the normative constraint that requires the Credit Check to occur before the Risk Assessment.
  - **Activity Violation:** Finalize Documentation was performed after a Loan Decision (Rejected). This is not allowed as per the normative rules.

**Case 3:**
- **No Violations:** The sequence of activities follows the strict normative rules:
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.

#### 2. Desiderata Condition Failures

**Case 1:**
- **No Desiderata Violations:** All activities were performed within the recommended time frames and the follow-up call was not required.

**Case 2:**
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Timing Violation:** The Credit Check was performed after the Risk Assessment, which is a normative violation, but it also indicates a delay in the Credit Check process.
  - **Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call was made before closing the case, which is a desideratum violation.

**Case 3:**
- **Desiderata Violations:**
  - **Timing Violation:** The Credit Check was performed more than 24 hours after the application was received.
  - **Timing Violation:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision.
  - **Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call was made before closing the case.

#### 3. Interpretations and Justifications

**Case 1:**
- **Interpretation:** This case followed all normative rules and desiderata conditions perfectly. It represents the ideal process execution.

**Case 2:**
- **Interpretation:** The normative violations suggest a possible misunderstanding or error in the process execution. The Risk Assessment being performed before the Credit Check could indicate a procedural mistake or a system error. The Finalize Documentation activity after a rejection could be a human error or a miscommunication.
- **Justification:** The process might have been corrected midway (as seen by the Credit Check being performed after the Risk Assessment), but the finalization of documentation after a rejection indicates a lack of adherence to the normative rules.

**Case 3:**
- **Interpretation:** The timing violations suggest possible delays in the process, which could be due to workload, system issues, or other operational challenges. The lack of a follow-up call might indicate a less customer-centric approach or simply an oversight.
- **Justification:** While the normative rules were followed, the delays in the Credit Check and informing the applicant could be due to external factors such as high volume of applications or staffing issues. The absence of a follow-up call might be due to a lack of emphasis on this recommended practice.

### Summary

- **Case 1:** No violations of normative rules or desiderata conditions.
- **Case 2:** Violations of normative rules (ordering and activity) and desiderata conditions (timing and follow-up call).
- **Case 3:** No violations of normative rules but failures to meet desiderata conditions (timing and follow-up call).

These observations highlight the importance of adhering to both normative rules and desiderata conditions to ensure efficient and effective process execution.
