To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we need to analyze both the process variants and their execution times. Here are some key observations:

### 1. **Overall Process Complexity**
- **Protected Group**: The processes for the protected group are often more complex and involve multiple steps such as "Make Visit to Assess Collateral," "Request Co-Signer On Loan," and sometimes repeated visits to assess collateral.
- **Unprotected Group**: The processes for the unprotected group are generally simpler, with fewer instances of repeated visits or additional requirements.

### 2. **Execution Times**
- **Protected Group**: The average execution times for many processes in the protected group are significantly longer, especially for those involving multiple steps and repeated visits.
- **Unprotected Group**: The average execution times for most processes in the unprotected group are shorter, even for complex processes that involve similar steps.

### 3. **Loan Approval and Denial Rates**
- **Protected Group**: There is a higher frequency of loan denials and application rejections, especially in more complex processes.
- **Unprotected Group**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of loan approvals, particularly in simpler processes.

### 4. **Specific Process Variants**
- **Application Rejection**:
  - Protected: "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Application Rejected" (frequency = 960, performance = 219999.156)
  - Unprotected: "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Application Rejected" (frequency = 664, performance = 260002.042)
  - **Difference**: The protected group has a higher frequency of application rejections and a longer execution time.

- **Loan Denial**:
  - Protected: "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (frequency = 227, performance = 310015.991)
  - Unprotected: "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (frequency = 2709, performance = 340005.309)
  - **Difference**: The unprotected group has a much higher frequency of loan denials but with a shorter execution time.

- **Loan Approval**:
  - Protected: "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" (frequency = 31, performance = 310018.097)
  - Unprotected: "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" (frequency = 1656, performance = 340004.889)
  - **Difference**: The unprotected group has a much higher frequency of loan approvals but with a slightly longer execution time.

- **Repeated Visits**:
  - Protected: Multiple variants involve repeated visits to assess collateral, such as "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (frequency = 37, performance = 369971.649)
  - Unprotected: Fewer variants involve repeated visits, and when they do, the frequency is much lower.
  - **Difference**: The protected group faces more frequent and time-consuming processes involving multiple visits.

### Conclusion
The main differences suggest that the protected group experiences more complex and time-consuming processes, higher rates of application rejection and loan denial, and more frequent requirements for repeated visits. These factors indicate potential unfair treatment in the credit application process for the protected group.
