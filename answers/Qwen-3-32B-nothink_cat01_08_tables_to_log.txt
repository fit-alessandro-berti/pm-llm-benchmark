# Process Mining Event Log from ERP Data

Based on the provided ERP tables, I've created a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining. This event log contains one row per event with the required information.

## Event Log

## Key Assumptions and Notes

1. **Case Identification**: Used `order_id` as the case identifier as instructed.

2. **Event Derivation**: 
   - Created "Order Created" events from the Orders table
   - Created "Item Picked" events from the Order Lines table
   - Created "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events from the Delivery table
   - Created "Invoice Issued" events from the Invoice table
   - Created "Payment Received" events from the Payments table

3. **Timestamp Mapping**: Used the specific timestamps provided in each table to maintain chronological accuracy.

4. **Resource Mapping**: Mapped resource IDs to names and roles using the Resources table where possible.

5. **Multiple Deliveries/Invoices/Payments**: Handled multiple delivery records, invoice records, and payment records for the same order as separate events.

6. **Missing Data**: No data was missing that would prevent the creation of a comprehensive event log.

This event log is now ready for process mining analysis to discover, monitor, and improve business processes.
