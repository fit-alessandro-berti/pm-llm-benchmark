Let's analyze the provided process variants to identify root causes of performance issues, focusing solely on process and data-specific aspects:

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to Consider:**

* **Frequency:** How often a specific variant occurs. Higher frequency of inefficient variants indicates a larger impact.
* **Performance:**  Average time taken for each variant. Higher values indicate longer processing times and potential bottlenecks.

**Analysis of Performance Issues:**

1. **Rework Loops due to Rejections:**

   * **Significant Performance Impact:**  Variants involving rejections (e.g., "REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION," "REJECTED by SUPERVISOR," "REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER," "REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER," "REJECTED by MISSING") consistently exhibit significantly higher performance times (longer duration) compared to variants without rejections.
   * **Examples:**
     * `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE ( frequency = 174 performance = 727139.517 )`  Even a simple rejection loop has a substantial performance value.
     *  Variants with multiple rejection cycles (e.g., `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> ... -> Payment Handled`) exhibit the longest performance times, sometimes exceeding 2,000,000 or even 3,000,000.

   * **Root Cause:**  Rejections introduce rework, requiring the process to repeat steps, leading to delays and increased processing time. The reasons for these rejections need investigation. Potential data issues include:
     * **Incomplete or Incorrect Information:** Employees submitting declarations with missing data or errors.
     * **Non-compliance with Policies:** Declarations not adhering to budget guidelines or approval criteria.
     * **Lack of Clarity in Requirements:** Ambiguous instructions leading to incorrect submissions.

2. **Presence of Optional Steps Leading to Variability:**

   * **Observation:**  The process exhibits significant variability in the steps involved across different variants (e.g., some involve "APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" or "APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" while others don't).
   * **Performance Implication:** This variability likely introduces complexity and unpredictability in processing times.
   * **Root Cause:**
     * **Unclear Criteria for Optional Steps:** The conditions triggering these optional approval steps are not explicit. This ambiguity can lead to inconsistencies and delays.
     * **Data Dependencies:**  The necessity of specific approvals (e.g., BUDGET OWNER or PRE_APPROVER) might depend on the data within the declaration (e.g., amount, expense category). Inefficiencies might arise if these dependencies are not clearly defined or if the data is not readily available.

3. **Potential Data Accessibility Issues:**

   * **Evidence:** The variants involving "REJECTED by MISSING" suggest data might not be readily available during initial processing.
   * **Examples:**
     * `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> ...`
   * **Root Cause:**
     * **Data Integration Problems:**  Necessary data might reside in separate systems that are not integrated with the declaration processing system.
     * **Data Entry Delays:**  Data required for approval might be entered later, causing delays and potential rejections.

4. **Potential "Payment Handled" Efficiency Issues:**

   * **Observation:** The variant `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled` has a very high performance time (9110508.000) despite a seemingly streamlined path.
   * **Possible Root Cause (Data-Specific):**
     * **Complex Payment Processing:** The payment handling step might involve complex validation or integration with external payment systems, leading to delays if data required for payment is incomplete or incorrect.
     * **Manual Intervention in Payment Handling:** Manual steps in the payment process (e.g., manual verification or data entry) can introduce bottlenecks.

**Data-Specific Questions for Further Investigation:**

* **What data is required at each step of the process?**
* **Where does this data originate?**
* **Are there data validation rules at each step?**
* **How is data accessed by different roles involved in the process?**
* **Are there any known data quality issues?**

**In summary, the primary process and data-specific root causes for performance issues in this process are:**

* **Extensive rework loops caused by rejections (due to data errors, policy non-compliance, etc.).**
* **Variability and complexity introduced by optional approval steps (likely due to data dependencies and unclear criteria).**
* **Potential data accessibility issues leading to "MISSING" rejections.**
* **Possible inefficiencies within the "Payment Handled" step, potentially linked to complex data validation or manual interventions.**

By addressing these data-related issues, you can significantly improve the efficiency and reduce the performance times of your declaration processing process.
