### Notes on Process:
1. **Activity Names**: Activity names like "Order Created," "Item Picked," "Order Dispatched," "Order Arrived," etc., were inferred based on key lifecycle events from the data.
2. **Event Timestamps**: Each event corresponds to an explicit timestamp from the tables.
3. **Resource/Actor**: Links to actors (e.g., Sales Person, Warehouse Staff, Carrier) are included when available from the `Resources Table`.
4. **Other Attributes**: Additional details (e.g., delivery notes, payment method, or quantity) were added where appropriate.
