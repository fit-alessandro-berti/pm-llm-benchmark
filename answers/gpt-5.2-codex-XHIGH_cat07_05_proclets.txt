The image is a threepart figure about a hospital laboratory workflow.

**(a) Two connected process models:**  
On the left is a BPMNstyle “Lab visit” process carried out by a doctor and lab assistant: *Order entry  Take blood sample  Receive result  Judge results  (if everything fine) Send report; otherwise “Do tests again”  Receive updated result  Send report*.  
On the right is the “Lab test” process performed by a chemical analyst: *Perform test  Make report  Finish lab test*, with a loop for retesting (*Perform test again  Provide updated report*).  
The two processes communicate through two dashed message channels labeled **Order system** and **HIS**, linking tasks such as ordering tests and reporting results.

**(b) Class diagram:**  
A small UML diagram shows two proctlet classes, **Lab visit** and **Lab test**, with an association **requires**. Multiplicity indicates each lab visit requires one or more lab tests (1..*), and each lab test belongs to exactly one lab visit (1..1).

**(c) Example performative (message):**  
A table illustrates a message exchanged on a channel, with columns *Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, Direction*. Example: at 11:00 via the **Order system**, “Lab visitJohn” sends a **Create** request to “Lab testHGB”: “Can you perform a HGB test for John?” (scope: Private, direction: OUT).
