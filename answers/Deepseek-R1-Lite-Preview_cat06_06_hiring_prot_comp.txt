To identify the unfair differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, we'll compare the process variants and their frequencies, focusing on the thoroughness and successful outcomes.

### Key Differences:

1. **Process Complexity and Thoroughness:**
   - **Protected Group:**  
     - More process variants end prematurely without successful treatment or discharge.
     - Less frequent occurrence of comprehensive processes involving multiple examinations and steps.
     - Fewer instances of processes like "Expert Examination" or "Thorough Examination."
   
   - **Unprotected Group:**  
     - Higher frequency of detailed processes that include "Expert Examination," "Thorough Examination," and successful treatment.
     - More complex and complete process variants, indicating a more thorough case handling.

2. **Frequency of Comprehensive Treatment:**
   - **Protected Group:**  
     - Lower frequencies for complex processes, e.g., "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" occurs only 73 times.
     - Higher frequencies for incomplete processes, like "Register at ER" alone (158 times) or "Register at FD" alone (156 times).
   
   - **Unprotected Group:**  
     - High frequencies for detailed processes, e.g., "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" occurs 1,466 times.
     - Complete processes are much more common, suggesting more comprehensive care.

3. **Outcome Success:**
   - **Protected Group:**  
     - Lower frequencies of "Treatment successful -> Discharge," indicating fewer successful outcomes.
     - More occurrences of processes that do not reach a successful conclusion or terminate prematurely.
   
   - **Unprotected Group:**  
     - Higher frequencies of successful treatment and discharge, e.g., "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" occurs 1,418 times.

4. **Potential Indicators of Bias:**
   - The protected group experiences more incomplete or abbreviated processes, suggesting their cases might be deprioritized or not handled with the same level of care.
   - The unprotected group is more likely to receive comprehensive and successful treatment, indicating a disparity in the thoroughness and effectiveness of their care.

### Conclusion:
The main differences suggest that the protected group is receiving less thorough and less successful treatment compared to the unprotected group. The protected group's processes are often incomplete or lack the detailed steps (such as expert or thorough examinations) that are more commonly applied to the unprotected group, potentially pointing to unfair differences in how their cases are managed.
