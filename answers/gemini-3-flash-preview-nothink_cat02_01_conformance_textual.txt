Based on the normative process description provided, here is an analysis of the event log to identify and explain the violations for each case.

### Summary of Deviating Cases
The following cases violate the normative process: **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5.**

### Detailed Analysis of Violations

#### **Case 2: Violation of Activity Sequencing**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ **Package items** $\rightarrow$ **Authorize payment** $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **Explanation:** This case violates the rules regarding payment authorization and packaging.
    *   **Rule Violation:** The normative description explicitly states: *"Package items should only occur after authorization"* and *"Authorize payment should only occur... before packaging."*
    *   **Deviation:** In this case, "Package items" occurred at 10:00, while "Authorize payment" did not occur until 10:30. This is a sequence inversion; the process should ensure payment is valid before physical items are handled for packaging.

#### **Case 3: Violation of Cancellation Logic and Fulfillment Rules**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Cancel order** $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **Explanation:** This case contains multiple critical violations.
    *   **Rule Violation 1:** The description states that if inventory is sufficient, the process proceeds to authorization and packaging. If inventory is insufficient, it proceeds directly to "Cancel order." By performing "Authorize payment" and then "Cancel order," the process logic is conflicted.
    *   **Rule Violation 2:** Most importantly, the text states: *"Once an order is canceled... the next reasonable step is to 'Close order'"* and *"'Ship order' should... never [occur] after a cancellation."*
    *   **Deviation:** Shipping an order at 10:30 after it was canceled at 10:00 is a direct violation of the safety and logical constraints of the process. Additionally, "Package items" was skipped entirely.

#### **Case 5: Violation of Mandatory Steps (Missing Activity)**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **[Missing Package items]** $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **Explanation:** This case violates the requirement for sequential preparation before shipping.
    *   **Rule Violation:** The description states: *"Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'."* It further clarifies that *"Ship order should only occur after packaging."*
    *   **Deviation:** The process jumped directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order," skipping the "Package items" activity. Even if inventory is available and payment is authorized, the normative process requires an explicit packaging step to be recorded before shipment can occur.

### Valid Cases (For Reference)

*   **Case 1:** This is the "Happy Path" for sufficient inventory. It follows the exact sequence: Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ Package $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close.
*   **Case 4:** This is the correct "Insufficient Inventory" path. It follows the sequence: Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Cancel $\rightarrow$ Close, which aligns perfectly with the textual description for stock-out scenarios.
