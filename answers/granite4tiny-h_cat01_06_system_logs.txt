**Explanation of the Event Log Construction**

1. **Case Identification:**  
   The log was segmented into distinct cases based on logical work sessions that could be traced through consecutive interactions with the same or different applications:
   - **C1**: Editing a quarterly report in *Word* (`Quarterly_Report.docx`). This case starts when the user opens `Quarterly_Report.docx`, continues with typing/editing, and ends by saving/closing.
   - **C2**: Switching from writing to reviewing email content. The transition occurs after opening an email in Chrome (`Email - Inbox`) and ending with a reply/action within that same application context.
   - **C3**: Working on budget figures across two applications: *Excel* for calculations and then pasting into Word to reference the data. Switches between these apps are recognized as case boundaries because they involve moving focus or switching tasks (budget vs. narrative).
   - **C4**: Similar to C2 but with different applications; focusing on email interactions again.
   - **C5**: Editing the same quarterly report, continuing from where C1 left off.

2. **Activity Naming:**  
   Each raw action was mapped to a more meaningful descriptor:
   - *FOCUS*  Set focus on an application/window (applicable across cases).
   - *TYPING*  Keyboard input recognized with specific keys for summarization.
   - *SWITCH*  Transition between different applications or windows; also identified movement direction when relevant (`FromApp/ToApp` etc.).
   - *CLICK*  Interaction with UI elements, named based on action/context (`Open Email`, `Reply to Email`, `Send Email`, `Highlight Text`, etc.).
   - *SCROLL*, *HIGHLIGHT*  Specific UI interactions that provided context for the workflow (e.g., navigating through an email or emphasizing key text).

3. **Timestamps:**  
   The original timestamps were retained to preserve temporal relationships, ensuring that each case reflects a coherent work period.

4. **Activity Flow Narrative:**  
   Each case tells a story of user productivity:
   - **C1** shows the full lifecycle of drafting and finalizing a report.
   - **C2** captures how users might switch between communication channels while working.
   - **C3** reflects typical crossapplication workflows where numeric data informs narrative content.
   - **C4** repeats the email interaction pattern, possibly indicating regular status updates.
   - **C5** completes another round of report refinement.

These case groupings allow analysts to trace productivity patterns, potential bottlenecks (e.g., frequent switches), and interactions between tools that could be optimized in a workflow redesign.
