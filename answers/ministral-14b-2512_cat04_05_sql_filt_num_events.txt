Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task you described:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_event_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

This query:
1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) that counts events per `case_id` and filters to only include cases with 6 or fewer events
2. Joins this filtered set back to the original event_log table to get all events from qualifying cases
3. Returns all columns from the original events (using `e.*`)
4. Orders the results by case_id and timestamp for better readability

The query efficiently filters out cases with more than 6 events while preserving all events from the remaining cases.
