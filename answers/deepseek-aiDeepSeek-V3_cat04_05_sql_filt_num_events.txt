Hereâ€™s a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task:

```sql
WITH case_event_count AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
JOIN
    case_event_count cec
ON
    el.case_id = cec.case_id
WHERE
    cec.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:
1. **`case_event_count` CTE**: 
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the number of events (`event_count`) for each `case_id` by grouping the `event_log` table and using `COUNT(*)`.
   
2. **Main Query**:
   - The main query joins the original `event_log` table (`el`) with the `case_event_count` CTE (`cec`) on `case_id`.
   - It filters the results to include only those cases where `event_count` is six or fewer (`cec.event_count <= 6`).
   - The `SELECT el.*` ensures that all columns from the `event_log` table are returned for the filtered cases.

This query efficiently identifies cases with six or fewer events and returns the corresponding events.
