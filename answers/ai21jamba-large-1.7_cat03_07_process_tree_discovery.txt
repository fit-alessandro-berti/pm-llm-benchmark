Here is a process tree that represents the observed behavior while balancing fitness, precision, and simplicity:

```rust
-> ( 
    "Receive Application (RA)", 
    -> (
        "Validate Form (VF)",
        -> (
            "Assess Eligibility (AE)",
            + (
                -> ( 
                    "Approval Decision (AD)", 
                    -> (
                        "Send Confirmation (SC)", 
                        -> "Archive Case (AC)"
                    )
                ),
                * (
                    + (
                        "Request Missing Info (RMI)",
                        "Validate Form (VF)"
                    ),
                    "Assess Eligibility (AE)"
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sequence:**
	- Each step of the process logically follows the next in sequence:
		- Receive Application (RA) -> Validate Form (VF) -> Assess Eligibility (AE).
2. **Concurrency:**
	- The `+` operator represents the choice between:
		- A linear sequence leading to approval, confirmation, and archival.
		- A loop that allows for repeated Request Missing Info (RMI) and re-validation.
3. **Loop Construct (*** operator):
	- Captures the potential repetition of requesting missing information and re-validating the form until eligibility is confirmed.
4. **Final Sequence:**
	- Ends in the approval, confirmation, and archival steps, ensuring no ambiguity in the main process flow.

### Process Description:

- The process starts with receiving and validating the application.
- Then eligibility is assessed.
- If additional information is needed, the loop repeats missing info requests and re-validation.
- If no further information is needed, the process proceeds to approval, confirmation, and archival.
