 Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performance times, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. Different registration points: The unprotected group primarily registers at FD (Family Doctor) or ER (Emergency Room), while the protected group also registers at other locations, which could suggest accessibility differences.

2. Higher frequency of expert and thorough examinations: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of both expert and thorough examinations compared to the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group receives more detailed and specialized care.

3. Lower frequency of unsuccessful treatments: The unprotected group has a lower frequency of treatments with unsuccessful outcomes compared to the protected group. This could suggest better treatment quality or more appropriate initial diagnoses.

4. Faster discharge times: The unprotected group has more instances of discharge, which could indicate faster recovery times, while the protected group has more instances of unsuccessful treatments and readmissions.

5. Different performance times: Despite the higher frequency of expert examinations and fewer unsuccessful treatments, some performance times (treatment times) are comparable between the two groups, which might suggest that the unprotected group receives more efficient care.

6. Different process variants: The unprotected group's process variants more frequently involve expert and thorough examinations, which may indicate a more comprehensive approach to treatment.

7. Higher frequency of registrations without diagnosis or treatment: The protected group has more registrations without diagnosis or treatment compared to the unprotected group, which could indicate issues with access or continuity of care.

The main differences identified here might be influenced by various factors, such as availability of resources, access to healthcare, and the demographics and healthcare needs of each group. These findings suggest potential areas for further investigation to ensure fairness and effectiveness in the provision of healthcare services.
