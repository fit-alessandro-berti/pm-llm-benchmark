Based on the provided event log subset, we can identify the following high-level activities that represent coherent stages of the manufacturing process. These activities are grouped based on their logical connections, execution order, and their relevance to specific phases of the manufacturing workflow.

### High-Level Activities

1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Group of Events:**
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet
     - Scan barcode
     - Place metal sheet on table
     - Align metal sheet
     - Preheat metal sheet
   - **Justification:** 
     These events are all critical to preparing the raw material for further processing. They involve retrieving the material, ensuring it’s properly identified and placed for assembly, then aligning and preheating it to the necessary specifications. This step is foundational to the subsequent assembly operations.
   - **Name:** Material Preparation

2. **Assembly**
   - **Group of Events:**
     - Pick up welding tool
     - Weld corner A
     - Weld corner B
   - **Justification:** 
     These events are directly associated with the assembly phase of the manufacturing process. The action of picking up the welding tool logically leads to the welding of parts. Specifically, the welding corners A and B indicate the assembly of components that should be joined together. Therefore, it makes sense to group these actions as part of the assembly phase.
   - **Name:** Assembly

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - **Group of Events:**
     - Measure weld integrity
     - Visual check
   - **Justification:** 
     Both of these events serve the function of ensuring that the product meets quality standards. Measuring the integrity of the weld provides quantitative data about the assembly, while the visual check gives a qualitative assessment of the assembly. Their purpose and timing in the process after assembly make them part of a quality assurance step.
   - **Name:** Quality Assurance

4. **Coating Application**
   - **Group of Events:**
     - Apply protective coating
     - Dry coating
   - **Justification:** 
     Coating and drying are distinct but closely related steps that protect the assembled product. Applying the protective coating is followed by drying to ready the product for final inspections or packaging. These actions logically fit together regarding process flow.
   - **Name:** Coating Application
