The diagram is a Sankey diagram that visualizes the flow of events over time, specifically focusing on the progression of accounts from receiving a fine notification to either paying the fine or being sent for credit collection. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the upper section represents the 'Send Fine' events, and the lower section represents the subsequent actions taken, either 'Insert Fine Notification' or 'Send for Credit Collection.' The x-axis spans from January 25, 2000, to April 24, 2013, indicating the timeline over which these events occur. The upper section shows a dense series of vertical lines, each representing a fine being sent. The lower section shows lines diverging from the 'Insert Fine Notification' point, with some lines continuing downward to 'Send for Credit Collection,' highlighted in red to indicate accounts that did not pay the fine. The flow of lines from the upper to the lower section illustrates the transition of accounts through the process, with the red lines specifically marking the accounts that failed to comply with the fine payment. The overall concept conveyed by the diagram is the tracking of fine notifications and the subsequent actions taken based on compliance or non-compliance, providing a visual representation of the enforcement process over time.
