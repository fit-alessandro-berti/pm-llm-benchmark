### **Analysis of Loan Application Process Events**

We evaluate the event log based on two layers:

- **Part 1: Normative Rules (Strict)** – Any violation here constitutes a **serious deviation** from the required process behavior.
- **Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended)** – Violations here are **non-critical**, but indicate **suboptimal practice**.

##  **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules (Strict Rules)**

###  **Case ID: 2** – **Violation of Normative Sequence and Logic**

#### **Observed Activities:**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|--------|
| 2024-01-11 08:00 | Application Received |
| 2024-01-11 08:20 | Risk Assessment *(Too early – no Credit Check yet)* |
| 2024-01-11 09:00 | Credit Check |
| 2024-01-11 09:30 | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 2024-01-11 10:00 | Finalize Documentation *(After rejection – NOT allowed)* |
| 2024-01-11 10:30 | Close Case |

####  **Violations Identified:**

1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  
   - **Rule:** Credit Check must occur *before* Risk Assessment.
   - **Violation:** Risk Assessment is performed at `08:20`, while Credit Check occurs only at `09:00`.  
   - **Severity:** **Serious** – breaks fundamental sequence.

2. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**  
   - **Rule:** If loan is rejected, **do not finalize documentation** before closing.
   - **Violation:** Finalize Documentation occurs at `10:00` *after* a rejection decision.
   - **Severity:** **Serious** – contradicts decision logic.

3. **Closing the case after invalid documentation step**  
   - Even though the case is closed, the prior action (finalizing docs after rejection) invalidates the compliance of the entire path.

####  **Conclusion:**  
**Case 2 violates multiple strict normative rules.**  
- Sequence broken: Risk Assessment before Credit Check  
- Logic violated: Finalizing documentation after rejection  
 **Non-compliant with the normative process.**

---

###  **Case ID: 1** – **Fully Compliant**

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|--------|
| 09:00 | Application Received |
| 09:30 | Credit Check |
| 10:00 | Risk Assessment |
| 11:00 | Loan Decision (Approved) |
| 13:00 | Inform Applicant |
| 13:30 | Finalize Documentation |
| 14:00 | Close Case |

####  Compliance Check:
- All activities in correct order   
- Credit Check before Risk Assessment   
- Risk Assessment before Decision   
- Decision before Inform Applicant   
- Approved  Finalize Documentation  Close Case   
- No documentation after rejection  (not applicable here)

>  **Case 1 is fully compliant with all normative constraints.**

---

###  **Case ID: 3** – **No Normative Violations**

| Timestamp | Activity |
|---------|--------|
| 09:00 | Application Received |
| 10:00 | Credit Check *(2 days later – desideratum violation only)* |
| 11:00 | Risk Assessment |
| 12:00 | Loan Decision (Approved) |
| 15:00 | Inform Applicant *(>48h after decision – desideratum issue)* |
| 09:00 | Finalize Documentation |
| 10:00 | Close Case |

####  Normative Compliance:
- Credit Check occurs before Risk Assessment   
- Risk Assessment before Decision   
- Decision before Inform Applicant   
- Approved  Finalize Documentation  Close Case   
- No documentation after rejection  (not applicable)  
- No skipped steps or reversed order

>  **Case 3 adheres to all normative rules.**

---

##  **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata (Recommended Best Practices)**

These are **not serious violations**, but represent **opportunities for improvement**.

---

###  **Case ID: 3** – **Desiderata Violations**

#### **Violation 1: Credit Check Delayed (>24 hours after application)**  
- Application received: **2024-01-12 09:00**  
- Credit Check: **2024-01-14 10:00**  **49 hours later**
- **Desideratum:** Credit Check should be completed within **24 hours** of application receipt.
- **Status:**  Violated (but not normative)

#### **Violation 2: Inform Applicant Delayed (>48 hours after decision)**  
- Loan Decision: **2024-01-14 12:00**  
- Inform Applicant: **2024-01-16 15:00**  **51 hours later**
- **Desideratum:** Inform applicant within **48 hours** of decision.
- **Status:**  Violated

#### **Violation 3: No Follow-up Call Before Closing**  
- **Desideratum:** Perform a Follow-up Call before closing to ensure alignment.
- **No such event in log**   Not performed
- **Status:** Non-compliance with recommended best practice

>  **All three desiderata violations occur in Case 3.**  
> These are **suboptimal**, but **do not break the core process rules**.

---

###  **Case ID: 2** – **Desiderata Violations (Additional Context)**

Although Case 2 is **already non-compliant** due to normative violations, we can still assess its **desiderata adherence** for completeness.

#### **Violation 1: Credit Check Delayed (but not applicable)**  
- Application received: 08:00  
- Credit Check: 09:00  **1 hour later**   Within 24h window

#### **Violation 2: Inform Applicant Not Done in Time?**  
- Loan Decision: 09:30  
- Inform Applicant: **Not recorded at all** in the log  
- **No "Inform Applicant" activity**  **Major issue**  
- Even if the decision was rejected, the applicant must be informed.
- **But this is already covered under normative failure** (no inform step), so it's not just a desideratum issue — it's a **normative violation**.

>  **Note:** The absence of "Inform Applicant" in Case 2 is a **normative violation**, not just a desideratum issue.

#### **Violation 3: No Follow-up Call**  
- Not recorded   Missing
- But since Case 2 is already non-compliant, this is secondary.

>  **Desiderata violations in Case 2:**  
> - No follow-up call  
> - No "Inform Applicant" (this is normative, not desideratum)

---

###  **Case ID: 1** – **Fully Meets Desiderata (Best Practice)**

- Credit Check: 09:30  30 minutes after application   <24h  
- Inform Applicant: 13:00  2 hours after decision   <48h  
- No Follow-up Call recorded   Not performed  
- However, **this is not a violation** – it's just **not done**, not required.

>  **Case 1 meets all desiderata except follow-up call** (which is optional).

---

##  **3. Interpretations and Justifications (Where Applicable)**

We now attempt to **interpret** or **justify** the observed behaviors, **within the bounds of the constraints and recommendations**.

---

###  **Case ID: 2 – Possible Justifications for Violations**

Despite being non-compliant, we consider **plausible justifications** that *could* explain the behavior — **but only if they were allowed** under the rules.

####  **Why Risk Assessment Before Credit Check?**
- **Possible Justification:**  
  Perhaps the system **automatically triggered a preliminary risk check** based on limited data (e.g., income, employment) before full credit data was available.  
  - But this **violates the strict rule** that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.
  - Even if automated, it's **not permitted** under normative constraints.
  -  **No valid justification under the rules.**

####  **Why Finalize Documentation After Rejection?**
- **Possible Justification:**  
  Maybe the staff **mistakenly believed** that documentation was required for all cases, even rejected ones, for audit or record-keeping purposes.
  - But this contradicts the **explicit rule**: "If rejected, do not finalize documentation."
  - Even if well-intentioned, **this is a procedural error**.
  -  **Not justifiable under normative rules.**

>  **Conclusion:** No valid justifications exist for the normative violations in Case 2. The process **must be corrected**.

---

###  **Case ID: 3 – Justifications for Desiderata Violations**

These are **not serious**, so we can consider **plausible explanations**.

####  **Credit Check Delayed (49 hours):**
- **Possible Justification:**  
  - The applicant provided incomplete documentation initially.
  - Credit check was delayed due to external data provider delays (e.g., credit bureau outage).
  - Or the check was scheduled for a later business day due to high volume.
-  **Plausible**, especially if the delay was due to external factors beyond control.

####  **Inform Applicant After 51 Hours:**
- **Possible Justification:**  
  - The decision was made late in the day (12:00), and the team was on a break.
  - The applicant was unreachable during the first 48 hours (e.g., weekend, vacation).
  - A delay in the notification system (e.g., email server issue).
-  **Plausible**, especially if the team tried to contact the applicant earlier.

####  **No Follow-up Call:**
- **Possible Justification:**  
  - The case was closed quickly after approval.
  - The applicant had already been contacted during the process (e.g., via email or form).
  - The team may have deemed a follow-up unnecessary due to clear communication.
-  **Acceptable**, as the follow-up call is **recommended, not required**.

>  **These justifications are reasonable** and reflect real-world operational challenges.

##  **Final Summary**

| Case ID | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? | Summary |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| **1** |  No |  Only one (no follow-up call) | **Fully compliant & best practice** |
| **2** |  **Yes** (multiple) |  Yes (no follow-up, no inform) | **Serious non-compliance** – process broken |
| **3** |  No |  **Yes** (credit check delay, inform delay, no follow-up) | **Compliant normatively, suboptimal timing** |

---

##  **Recommendations**

1. **Case 2:**  
   - **Immediate correction** required.  
   - Re-train staff on sequence: **Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Decision  Inform  (only if approved: finalize  close)**  
   - Audit all rejected cases to prevent documentation after rejection.

2. **Case 3:**  
   - Implement **timely alerts** for Credit Check and Inform Applicant steps to meet desiderata.  
   - Introduce **automated reminders** for follow-up calls (even if optional).  
   - Monitor delays to identify systemic bottlenecks.

3. **General Process Improvement:**  
   - Use **process mining tools** to detect sequence violations and timing delays.  
   - Set up **automated gatekeepers** to prevent invalid transitions (e.g., block risk assessment without credit check).  
   - Encourage culture of **timely communication** and **follow-up**, even if not mandatory.

---

###  **Final Verdict:**

- **Only Case 2 violates normative rules**  **Must be addressed.**  
- **Case 3 fails desiderata**  **Suboptimal, but acceptable** with improvements.  
- **Case 1 is exemplary**  **Model for best practice.**

>  **Bottom Line:** The process is **mostly sound**, but **Case 2 shows a critical breakdown** that must be fixed to maintain integrity.
