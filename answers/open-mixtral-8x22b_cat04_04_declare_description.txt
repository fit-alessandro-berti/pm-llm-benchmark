Based on the provided constraints, the process described is a workflow for handling payment requests within an organization. Here is a description of the process:

1. The process starts when an employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE). This is an initialization constraint, meaning every trace of the process must start with this activity.

2. After the declaration is submitted, the supervisor must approve it (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR). This is indicated by the presence of the existence, exactly 1, and precedence constraints on these activities.

3. Once the supervisor approves the declaration, a request for payment is made (Request Payment). This is further supported by the response and chain response constraints between the activities 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Request Payment'.

4. After the request for payment is made, the payment is handled (Payment Handled). This is indicated by the existence, exactly 1, and succession constraints between 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled'.

5. The process has some other constraints like Co-Existence, which means that certain activities must occur together. For instance, if 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled', and 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must also occur.

6. There are also some activities that are absent from the process, indicated by the absence constraint. These activities include 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER', 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER', and 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'.

7. The process also has some alternate constraints, which strengthen the basic constraints by specifying that the events must alternate without repetitions. For example, if 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must occur next without any other activities occurring in between.

8. The chain constraints impose the directly-follows relation, which means that if one activity occurs, the other must immediately follow without any other activities in between. For instance, if 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must immediately follow.

In summary, the process is a linear workflow where an employee submits a declaration, the supervisor approves it, a payment request is made, and then the payment is handled. There are also several constraints that ensure the correct ordering and co-occurrence of activities.
