The loan approval process begins with the customer submitting their application, which triggers the "Receive_Application" activity. This activity is constrained by the "existence" and "init" constraints, ensuring that the application is received and that this marks the start of the process. The "absence" constraint for "Proceed_Without_Compliance" ensures that the process is always conducted with adherence to mandatory compliance protocols.

Following the receipt of the application, a "Preliminary_Credit_Check" is performed, enforced by the "exactly_one" and "response" constraints. This initial credit check is necessary to determine the creditworthiness of the applicant and is a crucial risk management step in the process. The "succession" constraint ensures that the credit check occurs before "Gather_Additional_Documents," promoting an efficient and logical order of operations.

After the preliminary credit check, the process moves to gathering any additional required documents from the customer, such as pay stubs or IDs. This activity is constrained by "existence" and "succession," ensuring that the necessary documents are collected and that this follows the credit check. The "coexistence" constraint enforces that "Gather_Additional_Documents" and "Authorize_Contract_Terms" occur together, ensuring that all necessary documents are collected before the loan terms are finalized.

Once all necessary documents are gathered, the loan offer package is assembled with the final terms, interest rates, and conditions. This activity, "Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package," is constrained by "responded_existence" and "chainresponse." The "responded_existence" constraint ensures that a quality assurance review is conducted after assembling the package, and the "chainresponse" constraint ensures that funds are not transferred until the package is assembled. This helps maintain quality and compliance standards and prevents fraud.

The "Quality_Assurance_Review" is then conducted to ensure that the prepared offer meets all internal quality and compliance standards. This activity is constrained by "precedence," ensuring that it occurs before "Authorize_Contract_Terms," and "chainsuccession," ensuring that it occurs before the loan offer package is assembled. These constraints help maintain high-quality loan offers and prevent non-compliant offers from being presented to customers.

After the quality assurance review, the loan terms are officially approved or finalized through the "Authorize_Contract_Terms" activity. This activity is constrained by "chainprecedence," ensuring that it occurs after the preliminary credit check, and "noncoexistence," ensuring that it does not occur at the same time as the transfer of funds. These constraints help prevent fraud and ensure that the loan terms are finalized only after all necessary checks have been completed.

Once the loan terms are approved, the funds are transferred into the customer's account through the "Transfer_Funds" activity. This activity is constrained by "altresponse," ensuring that the customer is notified after the funds are transferred, and "nonchainsuccession," ensuring that the transfer does not occur before the customer is notified of the final decision. These constraints help maintain operational best practices and ensure customer satisfaction.

Finally, the customer is notified of the outcome, next steps, or final decision through the "Notify_Customer" activity. This activity is constrained by "altprecedence," ensuring that it occurs before the funds are transferred, and "nonsuccession," ensuring that it does not occur immediately after the preliminary credit check. These constraints help maintain clear communication with the customer and ensure that they are aware of the status of their loan application.

If any activities were to occur out of the prescribed order or if mandatory steps were omitted, the consequences could be severe. For example, omitting the preliminary credit check could result in offering loans to high-risk applicants, increasing the likelihood of default. Proceeding without gathering necessary documents could lead to fraudulent applications being approved. Failing to conduct a quality assurance review could result in non-compliant loan offers being presented to customers. Transferring funds before authorizing contract terms or notifying the customer could lead to confusion, dissatisfaction, or even legal issues. Therefore, adhering to the constraints in the DECLARE model is crucial for ensuring a compliant, efficient, and customer-focused loan approval process.
