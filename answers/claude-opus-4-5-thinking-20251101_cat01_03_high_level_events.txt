# Event Log Analysis: High-Level Process Step Aggregation

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the event log patterns across cases A1 and B2, I identified **five distinct high-level process stages** that represent the complete manufacturing workflow. Below is my complete analysis with groupings, justifications, and structured output.

## Proposed High-Level Process Steps

### 1. **Material Preparation**

| Low-Level Events Included | Resource Type |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Retrieve raw metal sheet | Operator |
| Scan barcode | Operator |
| Place metal sheet on table | Operator |
| Align metal sheet | Robot Arm |
| Preheat metal sheet | Heating Unit |

**Rationale for Grouping:**
- **Temporal Proximity:** All events occur within a tight window (~15-20 seconds) at the start of the process
- **Logical Coherence:** All activities are prerequisites before any value-adding manufacturing work can begin
- **Functional Purpose:** These events collectively serve to:
  - Acquire and identify the raw material (retrieve + scan)
  - Position the material correctly (place + align)
  - Condition the material for processing (preheat)
- **Process Gate:** The preheat step marks a clear transition point—material is now ready for assembly operations

### 2. **Welding Assembly**

| Low-Level Events Included | Resource Type |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Pick up welding tool | Operator |
| Weld corner A | Operator |
| Weld corner B | Operator |

**Rationale for Grouping:**
- **Same Resource:** All events are performed by the same operator (Operator B)
- **Tool-Task Relationship:** The tool pickup is a necessary preparation for the welding tasks
- **Temporal Proximity:** Events occur within ~15 seconds
- **Core Manufacturing Activity:** This is the primary value-adding step where the product is physically assembled/joined
- **Consistent Pattern:** The sequence (tool preparation  sequential welding operations) is repeatable and represents a single logical unit of work

---

### 3. **Weld Quality Inspection**

| Low-Level Events Included | Resource Type |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Measure weld integrity | Quality Sensor |

**Rationale for Grouping:**
- **Inline Quality Gate:** This is a critical checkpoint immediately following the welding operation
- **Dedicated Resource:** Uses specialized quality sensor equipment
- **Decision Point:** The integrity score (95, 93 in examples) determines if the weld meets specifications
- **Separation Justification:** While temporally close to welding, this event serves a fundamentally different purpose (verification vs. production) and uses different equipment, warranting its own category

---

### 4. **Protective Coating**

| Low-Level Events Included | Resource Type |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Apply protective coating | Coating Unit |
| Dry coating | Heating Unit |

**Rationale for Grouping:**
- **Sequential Dependency:** Drying is a direct continuation of the coating application—they form an inseparable pair
- **Functional Unity:** Both events serve the purpose of surface treatment and protection
- **Different Process Phase:** This is clearly distinct from assembly (welding) and represents a finishing/treatment phase
- **Specialized Equipment:** Uses dedicated coating and curing equipment

---

### 5. **Final Quality Inspection**

| Low-Level Events Included | Resource Type |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Visual check | Operator |

**Rationale for Grouping:**
- **Terminal Position:** This is the last step in the process, serving as the final quality gate
- **Human Verification:** Unlike the automated weld check, this involves human judgment
- **Holistic Assessment:** The visual check evaluates the overall product quality (not just one aspect like weld integrity)
- **Pass/Fail Decision:** Determines if the product meets final acceptance criteria

## Grouping Rules Summary

| Rule | Description | Applied To |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Temporal Clustering** | Events occurring within short time windows (~20 sec) with logical connection | Material Preparation, Welding Assembly |
| **Resource Continuity** | Events performed by the same operator/resource | Welding Assembly |
| **Functional Purpose** | Events serving the same manufacturing objective | Protective Coating |
| **Sequential Dependency** | Events where one must immediately follow another | Coating  Drying |
| **Quality Gates** | Inspection/verification events separated from production events | Both Quality Inspection steps |
| **Process Phase Boundaries** | Natural break points where material state changes | Between all high-level steps |

---

## Alternative Grouping (More Aggregated)

If a simpler, three-level hierarchy is preferred:

| High-Level Stage | Sub-Activities | Low-Level Events |
|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Preparation** | Material Preparation | Events 1-5 |
| **Manufacturing** | Welding Assembly, Protective Coating | Events 6-8, 10-11 |
| **Quality Assurance** | Weld Inspection, Final Inspection | Events 9, 12 |

This alternative provides maximum simplification but loses some process visibility.

## Conclusion

The proposed five high-level activities provide a balanced view of the manufacturing process that:
- **Reduces complexity** from 12 low-level events to 5 meaningful stages
- **Preserves process insights** by maintaining visibility into quality gates
- **Enables better analysis** of cycle times, bottlenecks, and resource utilization at each phase
- **Supports compliance** by clearly identifying quality checkpoints
