Here's an example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Create PO', 'Send PO'), ('Receive Invoice', 'Verify Invoice')},
    'always_before': {('Create PO', 'Receive Goods'), ('Receive Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')},
    'always_after': {('Receive Goods', 'Verify Goods'), ('Verify Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')},
    'never_together': {('Create PO', 'Pay Invoice'), ('Receive Goods', 'Send PO')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create PO': {1},  # PO creation is mandatory
        'Send PO': {1},  # PO sending is mandatory
        'Receive Goods': {0, 1},  # goods reception is optional
        'Verify Goods': {0, 1},  # goods verification is optional
        'Receive Invoice': {1},  # invoice reception is mandatory
        'Verify Invoice': {1},  # invoice verification is mandatory
        'Pay Invoice': {1}  # invoice payment is mandatory
    },
    'directly_follows': {('Create PO', 'Send PO'), ('Receive Goods', 'Verify Goods'), ('Verify Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')}
}
```
This Log Skeleton model defines the following constraints for the Purchase-to-Pay process:

* Equivalence: Creating a PO and sending a PO are equivalent activities, as are receiving an invoice and verifying an invoice.
* Always Before: Creating a PO must always be followed by receiving goods, and receiving an invoice must always be followed by paying the invoice.
* Always After: Receiving goods must always be followed by verifying the goods, and verifying an invoice must always be followed by paying the invoice.
* Never Together: Creating a PO and paying an invoice cannot occur in the same case, and receiving goods and sending a PO cannot occur in the same case.
* Activity Frequencies: Each activity has a specific frequency constraint, e.g., PO creation is mandatory (must occur once), while goods reception is optional (may occur zero or one times).
* Directly-Follows: Creating a PO must be directly followed by sending a PO, receiving goods must be directly followed by verifying the goods, and verifying an invoice must be directly followed by paying the invoice.

Note that this is just one possible log skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process, and actual models may vary depending on the specific requirements and
