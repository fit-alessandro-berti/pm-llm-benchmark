Here’s a process tree (single root) that captures the full described behavior in the requested notation.

High-level structure:
- Overall: sequence from arrival to final clearances.
- XOR between CE and FBP.
- Loop for abnormal results: SC -> (X(TM, SPT)) -> (X(FCE, FBA)) repeated until normal.
- Parallel AI || NC.
- Final sequences and parallel clearances as specified.

Process Tree:

  'A',

          -> (
            X ( 'CE', 'FBP' ),
            * (
              tau,
              -> (
                'SC',
                -> (
                  X ( 'TM', 'SPT' ),
                  X ( 'FCE', 'FBA' )
                )
              )
            ),
            + ( 'AI', 'NC' ),
            -> (
              'FAS',
              -> (
                'DDI',
                + ( 'BL', + ( 'ICP', 'MRF' ) )
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)

Explanation of the loop (core part):
- * ( A, B ) means: do A once, then either exit or do B then A again.
- We set:
  - A = tau (represents “normal results / exit condition” after checks),
  - B = sequence of abnormal-result handling:
    -> ( 'SC', -> ( X('TM','SPT'), X('FCE','FBA') ) )
- This models zero or more iterations of [SC + chosen treatment + chosen follow-up test], then exit when results are normal.
