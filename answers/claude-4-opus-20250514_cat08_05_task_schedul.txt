# Advanced Process Mining-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Process Mining Approach for Job Flow Reconstruction

To reconstruct the actual job flows and task execution sequences, I would implement a multi-layered process mining approach:

**Event Log Preprocessing and Enhancement:**
- Extract and clean the MES event logs, ensuring temporal consistency and handling missing data
- Enrich events with calculated attributes: queue times, setup durations, processing delays
- Create case-level attributes aggregating job characteristics (total operations, priority changes, actual vs. planned metrics)

**Process Discovery Techniques:**
- Apply **Inductive Miner** algorithm to discover the actual process model, capturing all routing variants
- Use **Fuzzy Mining** to handle the high complexity of job shop routing, focusing on significant paths
- Implement **Multi-perspective Process Mining** to capture resource allocation patterns alongside control flow

### Key Performance Metrics Analysis

**Job Flow Times and Lead Time Distributions:**
```
Lead Time = Timestamp(Job Complete) - Timestamp(Job Released)
Flow Time = (Task Processing Time + Queue Time + Setup Time) for all tasks in job
Makespan = max(Completion Time) - min(Start Time) for a set of jobs
```

I would create statistical distributions (histograms, kernel density estimates) for each metric, segmented by:
- Job priority level
- Product complexity (number of operations)
- Time periods (to identify trends)

**Task Waiting Time Analysis:**
```
Queue Time = Timestamp(Task Start/Setup Start) - Timestamp(Queue Entry)
```

For each work center, I would:
- Calculate average, median, and 95th percentile queue times
- Identify patterns in queue length variations over time
- Correlate queue times with upstream/downstream resource states

**Resource Utilization Metrics:**
```
Productive Utilization = (Actual Task Duration) / Available Time
Setup Ratio = (Setup Duration) / (Total Processing Time)
Idle Time = Available Time - (Processing Time + Setup Time + Breakdown Time)
```

**Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Analysis:**

I would construct a **Setup Time Matrix** using process mining:
1. Extract all setup events with previous/current job information
2. Group by (Previous Job Type, Current Job Type) pairs
3. Calculate statistical distributions for each transition
4. Apply clustering to identify job families with similar setup requirements

```python
# Pseudo-code for setup time analysis
setup_matrix = {}
for setup_event in log:
    prev_job = setup_event.previous_job_type
    curr_job = setup_event.current_job_type
    duration = setup_event.actual_duration
    
    if (prev_job, curr_job) not in setup_matrix:
        setup_matrix[(prev_job, curr_job)] = []
    setup_matrix[(prev_job, curr_job)].append(duration)

# Calculate statistics for each transition
for transition, durations in setup_matrix.items():
    mean_setup = np.mean(durations)
    std_setup = np.std(durations)
    # Store distribution parameters
```

**Schedule Adherence and Tardiness Metrics:**
```
Tardiness = max(0, Actual Completion Date - Due Date)
On-Time Delivery Rate = Count(Jobs with Tardiness = 0) / Total Jobs
Average Tardiness = (Tardiness) / Count(Late Jobs)
```

**Disruption Impact Analysis:**

Using **Event Pattern Mining** and **Change Point Detection**:
- Identify breakdown events and measure ripple effects on downstream operations
- Quantify schedule recovery time after disruptions
- Analyze priority change events and their impact on other jobs' tardiness

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### Bottleneck Identification and Impact Quantification

**Multi-dimensional Bottleneck Analysis:**

1. **Utilization-based Detection:**
   - Resources with utilization > 85% consistently
   - High ratio of queue time to processing time at specific resources

2. **Flow-based Detection:**
   - Apply **Performance Spectrum** analysis to identify resources where most time is lost
   - Calculate **Waiting Time Impact** = Queue Time × Frequency of Visit

3. **Active Period Analysis:**
   - Identify resources with longest continuous busy periods
   - Measure queue growth rates during these periods

### Task Prioritization Inefficiencies

**Variant Analysis for On-time vs. Late Jobs:**

I would use process mining to compare execution patterns:
- Extract process variants for jobs completed on-time vs. late
- Identify systematic differences in:
  - Queue jumping patterns (priority violations)
  - Resource allocation sequences
  - Setup time optimization opportunities missed

**Evidence Mining Approach:**
```python
# Analyze priority inversions
priority_inversions = []
for resource in resources:
    queue_events = get_queue_events(resource)
    for t in time_periods:
        queue_state = get_queue_state(queue_events, t)
        inversions = count_priority_inversions(queue_state)
        if inversions > 0:
            priority_inversions.append({
                'resource': resource,
                'time': t,
                'high_priority_waiting': get_waiting_high_priority_jobs(queue_state),
                'low_priority_processing': get_processing_low_priority_jobs(queue_state)
            })
```

### Suboptimal Sequencing Analysis

**Setup Time Waste Quantification:**

1. Calculate actual total setup time from logs
2. Use optimization algorithms (e.g., TSP variants) to find near-optimal sequences
3. Compare: `Setup Time Waste = Actual Setup Time - Optimal Setup Time`

**Resource Starvation Detection:**

Using **Token Replay** techniques:
- Identify periods where downstream resources are idle while upstream resources have queues
- Quantify production loss due to starvation
- Map starvation patterns to specific scheduling decisions

### WIP Bullwhip Effect Analysis

**Time-Series Analysis of WIP Levels:**
- Apply **Fourier Transform** to identify oscillation patterns in WIP
- Calculate amplification ratios between stages
- Correlate WIP variations with scheduling rule changes or disruptions

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Static Rule Limitations in Dynamic Environment

**Analysis Framework:**

1. **Rule Performance Degradation Analysis:**
   - Segment historical data by system load levels
   - Measure rule effectiveness (tardiness, flow time) under different conditions
   - Identify threshold conditions where rules fail

2. **Myopic Decision Impact:**
   - Trace jobs that became late despite early favorable positions
   - Identify decisions that optimized local metrics but degraded global performance

### Visibility and Coordination Gaps

**Information Delay Analysis:**
- Measure time between state changes and scheduling decisions
- Quantify impact of stale information on decision quality

**Cross-Work Center Coordination:**
- Use **Organizational Mining** to identify communication patterns
- Measure instances where lack of downstream visibility caused upstream inefficiencies

### Estimation Accuracy Issues

**Predictive Accuracy Assessment:**
```python
# Analyze planning vs. actual discrepancies
estimation_errors = []
for task in completed_tasks:
    error_ratio = (task.actual_duration - task.planned_duration) / task.planned_duration
    estimation_errors.append({
        'task_type': task.type,
        'resource': task.resource,
        'operator': task.operator,
        'complexity_factors': task.complexity_metrics,
        'error_ratio': error_ratio
    })

# Build regression model to identify error drivers
error_model = RegressionModel()
error_model.fit(complexity_factors, error_ratios)
```

### Sequence-Dependent Setup Handling

**Current State Analysis:**
- Identify if current rules consider setup times in decisions
- Quantify additional delays from setup-unaware scheduling
- Map setup time patterns to identify optimization opportunities

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Multi-Factor Dynamic Dispatching with Learning

**Core Logic:**

Implement an adaptive dispatching rule that dynamically weights multiple factors based on current system state and historical performance.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Priority_Score(job_i, machine_m, time_t) = 
    w1(t) × Tardiness_Risk(i) +
    w2(t) × Setup_Time_Factor(i, m) +
    w3(t) × Downstream_Load_Factor(i) +
    w4(t) × Critical_Ratio(i) +
    w5(t) × Job_Value(i)

where:
- Tardiness_Risk(i) = P(Late|current_state) based on ML model
- Setup_Time_Factor(i, m) = normalized setup time from previous job
- Downstream_Load_Factor(i) = average utilization of downstream resources
- Critical_Ratio(i) = (Due_Date - Current_Time) / Remaining_Processing_Time
- Weights w_k(t) are dynamically adjusted based on system performance
```

**Process Mining Integration:**
- Train tardiness prediction model using historical completion patterns
- Build setup time prediction matrix from mined setup events
- Calculate downstream load factors from resource utilization patterns

**Addressing Pathologies:**
- Reduces tardiness through risk-based prioritization
- Minimizes setup waste through setup-aware sequencing
- Prevents downstream starvation through load balancing

**Expected Impact:**
- 25-30% reduction in average tardiness
- 15-20% reduction in total setup time
- 10-15% improvement in throughput

### Strategy 2: Predictive Schedule Generation with Stochastic Optimization

**Core Logic:**

Generate robust schedules using stochastic optimization that explicitly accounts for uncertainty in processing times, setup times, and disruption risks.

**Implementation Approach:**

1. **Stochastic Model Construction:**
```python
# Build probability distributions from process mining
processing_time_dist = {}
for task_type, resource in task_resource_pairs:
    historical_durations = mine_task_durations(task_type, resource)
    # Fit distribution (e.g., log-normal, gamma)
    distribution = fit_distribution(historical_durations)
    processing_time_dist[(task_type, resource)] = distribution

# Disruption probability model
disruption_model = TimeDependentPoissonProcess()
disruption_model.fit(historical_breakdowns)
```

2. **Robust Schedule Generation:**
- Use **Stochastic Programming** or **Robust Optimization** formulation
- Objective: Minimize expected tardiness +  × tardiness variance
- Constraints: Resource capacity, precedence, setup dependencies

3. **Real-time Schedule Adjustment:**
- Implement rolling horizon approach
- Re-optimize when actual deviates significantly from expected

**Process Mining Integration:**
- Mine task duration distributions considering operator skills, time of day, job complexity
- Extract disruption patterns and duration distributions
- Learn recovery time patterns post-disruption

**Addressing Pathologies:**
- Proactively buffers against bottlenecks
- Accounts for setup time variability
- Builds in slack for high-risk periods

**Expected Impact:**
- 30-35% reduction in tardiness variance
- 20-25% improvement in on-time delivery
- 15% reduction in expediting costs

### Strategy 3: Setup-Optimized Batch Formation with Look-Ahead

**Core Logic:**

Implement intelligent job batching and sequencing specifically targeting setup time minimization at bottleneck resources while maintaining due date performance.

**Algorithm Design:**

```python
def setup_optimized_scheduling(jobs, resources, horizon):
    # Phase 1: Job similarity clustering
    job_clusters = cluster_jobs_by_setup_similarity(jobs)
    
    # Phase 2: Bottleneck-focused batching
    for bottleneck_resource in identified_bottlenecks:
        # Create setup-minimal batches
        batches = form_batches(job_clusters, bottleneck_resource, 
                             max_batch_size, due_date_constraints)
        
        # Sequence batches using modified TSP
        batch_sequence = optimize_batch_sequence(batches, setup_matrix)
    
    # Phase 3: Non-bottleneck coordination
    for resource in non_bottlenecks:
        # Schedule to support bottleneck sequence
        schedule_supporting_operations(resource, bottleneck_schedule)
    
    return integrated_schedule
```

**Advanced Features:**

1. **Look-ahead Window:**
   - Consider jobs arriving within next n hours
   - Balance setup savings against holding costs

2. **Dynamic Batch Sizing:**
   - Adjust batch sizes based on current WIP and due date pressure
   - Smaller batches when tardiness risk is high

3. **Setup Family Learning:**
   - Continuously update job similarity metrics
   - Identify new setup-saving opportunities

**Process Mining Integration:**
- Mine setup time patterns to build accurate setup matrices
- Identify natural job families from historical sequences
- Learn optimal batch sizes from past performance

**Expected Impact:**
- 35-40% reduction in total setup time
- 20% increase in bottleneck throughput
- 25% reduction in average flow time
