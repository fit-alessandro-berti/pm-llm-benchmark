Below is a sample DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the desired filtering:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. The inner query:
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
   ```
   This groups all events by their `case_id` and counts how many events belong to each case. It then filters so that only `case_id` values with 6 or fewer events are returned.

2. The outer query:
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (...)
   ```
   This takes all the `case_id` values from the inner query and returns all rows from `event_log` corresponding to these cases. Cases that have more than six events are implicitly excluded, because they won't be returned by the inner query.

This ensures that you only get rows (events) from cases that have six or fewer total events.
