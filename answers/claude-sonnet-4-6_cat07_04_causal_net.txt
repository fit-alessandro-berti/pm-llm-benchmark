## Visualization Description

This image shows a **workflow process model** (likely a Petri net or EPC-style diagram) depicting a **request handling process**, along with a **legend** explaining the routing constructs used.

### Main Process Flow (Left/Center)

The workflow contains the following **activities (nodes)**:

| Node | Activity |
|------|----------|
| **a** | Register Request |
| **b** | Examine Thoroughly |
| **c** | Examine Casually |
| **d** | Check Ticket |
| **e** | Decide |
| **f** | Reinitiate Request |
| **g** | Pay Compensation |
| **h** | Reject Request |
| **z** | End |

### Flow Logic:
1. **Start  a** (Register Request)
2. From **a**, the process **splits** into parallel/alternative paths toward **b**, **c**, and **d**
3. These examination/check activities feed into **e** (Decide)
4. **e** can loop back through **f** (Reinitiate Request), which feeds back to **b**, **c**, or **d**
5. From **e**, the process splits to either:
   - **g**  Pay Compensation  **z** (End)
   - **h**  Reject Request  **z** (End)

### Legend (Bottom Right)

Explains **split and join routing constructs**:

| Type | Split | Join |
|------|-------|------|
| **XOR** | Exactly one path taken | Exactly one incoming path |
| **AND** | All paths taken | All paths must complete |
| **OR** | One or more paths taken | One or more paths must complete |

The dots on arcs indicate the **routing semantics** of each connector type.
