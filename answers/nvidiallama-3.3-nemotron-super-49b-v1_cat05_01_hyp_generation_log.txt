### Anomaly Identification, Hypotheses, and Investigative SQL Queries

#### **1. Out-of-Sequence Event: Case 1002 (Credit Check after Shipment Confirmation & Shipping)**

- **Anomaly Identified:** 
  - `Perform Credit Check` (event_id=11) occurs after `Confirm Shipment` (event_id=9) and `Ship Goods` (event_id=10).
- **Hypothesis:**
  - Oversight in process execution due to lack of automation or training.
  - Potential systemic error in workflow management.
- **Investigative SQL Queries:**

  ```sql
  -- Identify all cases where Credit Check happens after Shipment Confirmation
  SELECT * FROM order_event_log oel1
  JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
  WHERE oel1.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND oel1.event_id > oel2.event_id;

  -- Count occurrences by resource for potential training insights
  SELECT resource, COUNT(*) as OutOfSequenceCount
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
    AND case_id IN (
      SELECT oel1.case_id
      FROM order_event_log oel1
      JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
      WHERE oel1.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
        AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
        AND oel1.event_id > oel2.event_id
    )
  GROUP BY resource;
  ```

#### **2. Early Shipment without Explicit Credit Check Timing Issue: Case 1002**

- **Anomaly Identified:**
  - `Confirm Shipment` (event_id=9) and `Ship Goods` (event_id=10) occur very shortly after `Register Order` (event_id=8), with `Perform Credit Check` (event_id=11) happening even later.
- **Hypothesis:**
  - Potential bypass of critical checks for priority orders or error in timestamp recording.
  - Inadequate controls for expedited processes.
- **Investigative SQL Queries:**

  ```sql
  -- Investigate timeline for Case 1002
  SELECT * FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1002 ORDER BY timestamp;

  -- Check if this is a pattern for priority orders
  SELECT o.case_id, o.order_type, 
         MIN(CASE WHEN a.activity = 'Register Order' THEN timestamp END) AS RegTime,
         MIN(CASE WHEN a.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS CreditCheckTime,
         MIN(CASE WHEN a.activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS ShipTime
  FROM orders o
  JOIN order_event_log a ON o.case_id = a.case_id
  WHERE o.order_type = 'priority'
  GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_type
  HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN a.activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) - 
         MIN(CASE WHEN a.activity = 'Register Order' THEN timestamp END) < INTERVAL '1 hour';
  ```

#### **3. Payment Received before Invoice Issuance: Case 1004**

- **Anomaly Identified:**
  - `Receive Payment` (event_id=22) occurs before `Issue Invoice` (event_id=23).
- **Hypothesis:**
  - Incorrect timestamp entry.
  - Unrecorded pre-invoice payment arrangement (unlikely without additional_info hint).
- **Investigative SQL Queries:**

  ```sql
  -- Directly identify the anomaly
  SELECT * FROM order_event_log
  WHERE case_id = 1004 AND activity IN ('Receive Payment', 'Issue Invoice')
  ORDER BY timestamp;

  -- Check for patterns across all cases
  SELECT oel1.case_id, 
         oel1.timestamp AS PaymentTime, 
         oel2.timestamp AS InvoiceTime
  FROM order_event_log oel1
  JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
  WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
    AND oel1.event_id < oel2.event_id;  -- Incorrectly assuming event_id correlates with timestamp
  -- **Correction for Logic Error in Join Condition**
  -- The above query incorrectly assumes event_id order equals timestamp order. 
  -- **Corrected Query:**
  SELECT oel1.case_id, 
         oel1.timestamp AS PaymentTime, 
         oel2.timestamp AS InvoiceTime
  FROM order_event_log oel1
  JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
  WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
    AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;
  ```

#### **4. Shipment Confirmation and Shipping with No Apparent Stock Validation: Case 1003 & potentially others**

- **Anomaly Identified (Assumed based on provided normal flow):**
  - No `Validate Stock` event visible for Case 1003 before `Ship Goods`.
- **Hypothesis:**
  - Omission in logging.
  - Bypass of stock validation for certain conditions (e.g., known in-stock items).
- **Investigative SQL Queries:**

  ```sql
  -- Check for absence of Validate Stock before Ship Goods for Case 1003
  SELECT * FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1003 AND activity = 'Validate Stock';

  -- Identify all Ship Goods events without a preceding Validate Stock
  SELECT oel_ship.*
  FROM order_event_log oel_ship
  LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel_validate 
    ON oel_ship.case_id = oel_validate.case_id 
    AND oel_validate.activity = 'Validate Stock'
    AND oel_validate.event_id < oel_ship.event_id
  WHERE oel_ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    AND oel_validate.event_id IS NULL;
  ```

#### **5. Cancelled or Unshipped Order with Payment and Invoice: Case 1004**

- **Anomaly Identified:**
  - `Confirm Shipment` (event_id=24) indicates shipment was not scheduled, yet `Ship Goods` (event_id=25) occurred.
  - Payment received before invoice issuance.
- **Hypothesis:**
  - Systemic or logical error in shipment confirmation and execution.
  - Potential for incorrect or missed cancellation of orders.
- **Investigative SQL Queries:**

  ```sql
  -- Investigate the specific case for inconsistencies
  SELECT * FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = 1004 ORDER BY timestamp;

  -- Broad query to identify similar shipment inconsistencies
  SELECT *
  FROM order_event_log oel_ship
  JOIN order_event_log oel_confirm ON oel_ship.case_id = oel_confirm.case_id
  WHERE oel_ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    AND oel_confirm.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND oel_confirm.additional_info LIKE '%N%'  -- Assuming 'N' indicates not scheduled
    AND oel_confirm.event_id < oel_ship.event_id;
  ```
