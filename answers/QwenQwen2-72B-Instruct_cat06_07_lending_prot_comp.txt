Based on the provided data, we can identify several potential differences in the process variants experienced by the protected and unprotected groups. Here are the main differences:

1. **Process Variants with Significantly Higher Frequencies:**
   - The most frequent variant in the unprotected group is "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied," which occurs 2709 times. In contrast, the equivalent variant for the protected group occurs only 227 times, indicating a significant difference in loan denial frequency between the two groups.
   - Similarly, the variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" is much more frequent in the unprotected group (1656 times) than in the protected group (31 times).

2. **Process Variants Unique to Protected/Unprotected Groups:**
   - Certain process variants are only observed in the protected group, such as the variant ending with "Loan Agreement" after "Sign File to Underwriter" with multiple occurrences of "Make Visit to Assess Colateral."
   - Some process variants are unique to the unprotected group, such as "skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement."
   - The frequency of appointment denials appears to differ between the two groups, with a higher occurrence in the protected group.

3. **Execution Time (Performance) Disparities:**
   - Performance times (execution time) also vary significantly between the groups. Variants ending with "Loan Denied" have longer performance times in the protected group compared to similar variants in the unprotected group. For instance, the process variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" has an average performance of 310015.991 seconds for the protected group and 340005.309 seconds for the unprotected group. However, this might be due to the inclusion of additional activities like multiple "Make Visit to Assess Colateral."
   - Variants ending with "Sign Loan Agreement" also have lower performance times in the unprotected group compared to the equivalent variants in the protected group. For example, the variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" occurs 17 times in the protected group with an
