+ ( 
  'A', 
  -> ( 
    'B', 
    'RMI',           'Validation repeated: Receive Application (RA)  Validate Form (VF)'
    'C',              'Request Missing Info (RMI)  Re-validate: Validate Form (VF)'
    'D',                'Approval Decision (AD)'
    'E', 'Send Confirmation (SC)'
    'F', 'Archive Case (AC)'
  )
)  

Optimal structure explains:
- The main sequence: A  B  C  E  F, where C  E  F is the validated path.
- At B, an optional loop exists: after C, either stay at C (no repeat), or repeat:
   - C  D  (repeat Validate Form VF)
   - Then reconstruct E and F for the same case.
- Leaf nodes are activities: tau omitted (implied), and activities labeled `'RMI'`, `'Validation repeated'`, `'Request Missing Info'`, `'Re-validate'`, `'Approval'`, `'Send Confirmation'`, `'Archive Case'`.
- The loop semantics ensure multiple validation-on-MI cycles before finalization.

This captures repetition at C, convergence to the main flow, and final outcome.
