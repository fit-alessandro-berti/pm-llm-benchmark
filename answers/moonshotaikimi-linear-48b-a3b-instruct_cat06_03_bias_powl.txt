# Short Answer

The XOR in the model gives the underwriter freedom to **add a few "hard" points to every applicant who belongs to a local community group** and – by leaving non-members to the normal channel – effectively **admits a larger share of the favoured group**.  In practice this translates into a small but measurable statistical bias against any applicant whose membership is not recorded, even if she is equally credit-worthy.  Because the decision logic is not publicly declared and the difference in scores is incremental, the practice infringes both formal procedural fairness and the normative ideal of equal treatment.  It also creates talking-point for legal challenges: a lender who can show that the "skip" route is disproportionately used for non-members would be hard-pressed to prove that the resulting disparity is justified by business risk.

# Detailed Reasoning

## 1. How the XOR Branch Works in the Model

- A partial order model is a directed acyclic graph.
- XOR chooses **exactly one** child for execution.
  - **Branch "D"**: Underwriter explicitly checks membership in local-affiliation lists: the score is automatically boosted by, say, 10 points.
  - **Branch "skip"**: No such increase is added; the file goes straight to manual review.
- Once the branch is activated, it is selected **once**; there is no requirement to document why the underwriter selected skip or D.

## 2. Where the Bias Emerges

- **Populations that are disproportionately excluded from documented local affiliation lists** (people who live in informal communities, recent immigrants, digitally excluded users, etc.) will more often end up in the "skip" branch.
- Paradoxically, the 10-point uplift given to affiliated members is **modest**: it changes the probability of approval only a little on paper.  Yet the Delta principle in credit underwriting makes any incremental uplift worthwhile:
  - By repeatedly adding those 10 points, loan offers—and therefore liabilities—will be skewed several months later toward the affiliated population.
  - Regulatory calculators quickly translate small uplift × larger volume  measurable segment advantage.

## 3. Short-Term Impact

- **Lower default probability** = favourable financial metrics for the bank.
- **Cost-to-income ratio** improves when customers with a 10-point boost charge slightly higher rates but still convert.
- Stable regulatory capital requirement, because the (already modest) uplift is logged as a HC benefit in IRB/VA models.

## 4. Long-Term Implications

- **Equity and fairness**: Even if the uplift is small, the *pattern* of distribution is unequal.  The model is not aware of regulators’ expectation that credit decisions be *proportionate* across socio-economic groups, a requirement in GDPR Art. 22(a) plus a growing body of case law from the CFPB, US Federal Reserve, and FCA.
- **Non-members eventually notice**:
  - "Why do my neighbours with the same income get better terms?"
  - Digital word-of-mouth and social-media screws up marketing and brand perception.
- **Regulatory spotlight**: Any supervisory review will query group statistics:
  - Empirical evidence shows the gap between affiliated and non-affiliated acceptance or yield rates >2 p.p. (statistically significant)
  - Rebuttal argument "risk-based pricing" may not survive a `disparate-impact` test.

## 5. Mitigation Options (Outside the Model)

a) **Systematically delete affiliation scores**: Randomly assign every file to D or skip with equal probability; document the algorithmic decision so that a human cannot secretly inject business bias.

b) **Equalise uplift**: If affiliation must be rewarded, make the uplift a deterministic function of pre-defined criteria (e.g. 10 pts for verified community membership, 0 for unverifiable).  Remove discretion.

c) **A/B testing**: Run a sanctioned experiment measuring default vs. uplift; set the final business rule only after statistical demonstration that measured uplift prosocially improves repayment rates.

d) **Explainable output**: Attach counterfactual explanations ("if applicant A had been identified as a local member, the score would have risen to 643; score is 623 under current rules").  This makes the process auditable.

e) **External audit**: Habitu-al logging of every manual uplift and branch choice would let a compliance officer reconstruct the channel chosen and spot clusters of non-compliance.

# Conclusion

The silent yet intentional bias inserted by the XOR is not in the *astronomic* credit-score change (only 10 points), but in the data-driven *distribution of those 10-point rewards*.  In steady state the model silently funnels a larger share of marginal approvals toward documented local members, harming non-members and the lender’s legal posture while raising the risk of regulatory intervention or public backlash.
