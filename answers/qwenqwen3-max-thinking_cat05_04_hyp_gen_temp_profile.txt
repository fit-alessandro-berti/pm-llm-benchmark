### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive  Approve (R  P):**  
   - **Observation:** Average duration ~25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation (1 hour).  
   - **Concern:** Suggests an artificially constrained or scripted approval window that lacks natural variability, which is atypical for real-world claim handling involving human judgment or external verification.

2. **Approve  Notify (P  N):**  
   - **Observation:** Average delay of 7 days with high standard deviation (2 days).  
   - **Concern:** Indicates inconsistent or delayed customer communication—potentially due to batch processing, system failures, or manual bottlenecks in notification workflows.

3. **Assign  Close (A  C):**  
   - **Observation:** Average closure within 2 hours of assignment.  
   - **Concern:** Implies claims may be closed without completing intermediate steps (e.g., Evaluate or Approve), possibly reflecting erroneous closures, test records, or rapid denials without proper review.

4. **Evaluate  Notify (E  N):**  
   - **Observation:** Only 5 minutes on average between evaluation and notification.  
   - **Concern:** Unnaturally fast transition; likely indicates automation without human oversight, skipped steps, or timestamp inaccuracies (e.g., back-dated events).

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

- **R  P rigidity:** Approvals may be auto-triggered by a nightly batch job at a fixed time, forcing all approvals to occur within a narrow window regardless of actual evaluation timing. This would suppress natural variation.

- **P  N delay:** Notification might depend on a separate system (e.g., email gateway or CRM) that experiences periodic outages or is only processed weekly, leading to accumulation and bursty notifications.

- **A  C rapid closure:** Adjusters in certain regions or handling specific claim types (e.g., minor auto claims) may have authority to close claims immediately upon assignment if predefined criteria are met—but this could also reflect data entry errors where "Close" is logged prematurely.

- **E  N speed:** The "Notify" event might be programmatically generated the moment evaluation completes, with no actual customer contact occurring—suggesting a gap between system logging and real-world process execution.

### Verification SQL Queries

#### 1. **Identify claims with R  P duration outside expected range (e.g., <20h or >30h)**
```sql
WITH r_p_times AS (
    SELECT 
        r.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_seconds
    FROM 
        claim_events r
    JOIN 
        claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
    WHERE 
        r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    r_to_p_seconds / 3600 AS r_to_p_hours
FROM 
    r_p_times
WHERE 
    r_to_p_seconds < 72000  -- <20 hours
    OR r_to_p_seconds > 108000; -- >30 hours
```

#### 2. **Find claims with P  N delay >10 days or <1 day**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_days
FROM 
    claim_events p
JOIN 
    claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE 
    p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND (
        n.timestamp - p.timestamp > INTERVAL '10 days'
        OR n.timestamp - p.timestamp < INTERVAL '1 day'
    );
```

#### 3. **Detect claims closed within 3 hours of assignment, missing Evaluate or Approve**
```sql
WITH assigned AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS assign_ts FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'A'
),
closed AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS close_ts FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
),
has_evaluate AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E'
),
has_approve AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    a.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.close_ts - a.assign_ts)) / 3600 AS assign_to_close_hours
FROM 
    assigned a
JOIN 
    closed c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN 
    has_evaluate e ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
LEFT JOIN 
    has_approve ap ON a.claim_id = ap.claim_id
WHERE 
    c.close_ts - a.assign_ts <= INTERVAL '3 hours'
    AND (e.claim_id IS NULL OR ap.claim_id IS NULL);
```

#### 4. **Check E  N transitions under 2 minutes and correlate with claim type or adjuster**
```sql
SELECT 
    e.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_seconds,
    cl.claim_type,
    adj.specialization,
    adj.region
FROM 
    claim_events e
JOIN 
    claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN 
    claims cl ON e.claim_id = cl.claim_id
LEFT JOIN 
    adjusters adj ON e.resource = adj.name  -- assuming resource = adjuster name
WHERE 
    e.activity = 'E' 
    AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND n.timestamp - e.timestamp < INTERVAL '2 minutes';
```

These queries help isolate anomalous cases, enabling root-cause analysis by linking timing irregularities to claim attributes, adjuster behavior, or systemic workflow issues.
