To identify the main differences in the treatment of the protected group versus the unprotected group, we need to focus on process variants that show significant variations in frequency and performance metrics. Here are some key points:

### 1. **Final Outcome:**
   - **Protected Group:** The final state in most cases is "Tenant Cancels Appartment."
   - **Unprotected Group:** The final states can range from "Reject Prospective Tenant" to "Tenant Cancels Appartment."

### 2. **Frequency Analysis:**
   - **Protected Group:** The variants that lead to "Tenant Cancels Appartment" are much less frequent. For example, the second variant (which involves extensive screening and multiple rent payments) only occurred 12 times, while the unprotected group had a similar outcome but in far more cases.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The variants that lead to "Reject Prospective Tenant" are common, with multiple variants having frequency counts like 2,490 and 1,022.

### 3. **Process Complexity:**
   - **Protected Group:** There are process variants that include extensive screening and multiple interactions such as signing contracts, multiple rent payments, and potentially causing long-term financial and contract obligations.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Variants tend to be linear and simpler, primarily ending with rejection or cancellation.

### 4. **Performance Analysis:**
   - **Protected Group:** The performance metrics for variants that lead to long-term stays (like repeated rent payments and contract signings) are significantly higher, indicating longer engagement and higher operational costs.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The performance metrics for variants where tenants are rejected are also high but lower compared to the protected group's variants. This suggests that while the process is more straightforward, the frequency and nature of rejections are much higher.

### 5. **Key Variants and Differences:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Variances like "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" (frequency = 14, performance = 1,259,993.929) involve a much longer and more complex process.
     - These cases often result in longer engagements and higher performance metrics but are far less common.

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Variants like "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (frequency = 1,022, performance = 480,013.530) involve a much shorter and simpler process.
     - These cases are far more frequent and generally result in quicker rejections, affecting smaller numbers of people but on a much larger scale.

### Conclusion:
- **Fairness Issue:** The fundamental fairness issue lies in the disproportionate processing of the two groups, where the protected group undergoes a far more complex and time-consuming process that ends in a much lower rejection rate but is significantly less frequent. The unprotected group, on the other hand, undergoes a simpler process that ends in higher rejection rates but is much more common.
- **Potential Discrimination:** This suggests that the process for the protected group might be more regulated or involve additional scrutiny, which could be seen as more fair in terms of protection against unfair rejection but also less efficient in terms of policymaking and resource allocation.

To address this, review the processes in the protected group to ensure that any additional steps are necessary and aim to streamline the process for the unprotected group to improve efficiency without compromising fairness.
