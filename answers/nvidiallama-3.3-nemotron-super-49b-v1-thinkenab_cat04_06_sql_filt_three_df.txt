Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that excludes certain cases based on specific conditions. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the query needs to identify case_ids that have a sequence of exactly 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' followed by 'Confirm Order' in direct succession. Then, among those cases, we check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Finally, we exclude all events from such cases and return the rest.

Hmm, how to find the sequence. Since the activities must be in direct succession, we can't have any other events in between these three for the same case. So, for a case to match the sequence, there must be three consecutive events in the order specified. 

One approach is to use window functions to track the sequence. Maybe assign a row number within each case based on timestamp, then check if the activities follow the required sequence in consecutive rows. But how to ensure that the three are consecutive?

Wait, for each case, we can order the events by timestamp and assign a row number. Then, look for triples of rows where the activities are in the specified order and the row numbers are consecutive. But that might not be efficient for large logs. Alternatively, maybe use LAG functions to check the previous two activities.

Alternatively, perhaps self-join the table three times with appropriate offsets to match the sequence. For example, for a case, the first event is 'Approve...', then the next event (immediately following in the case's timeline) is 'Create Order', and the next one is 'Confirm Order'. So, using LAG twice: LAG(activity, 1) = 'Create Order' and LAG(activity, 2) = 'Approve...' when the current activity is 'Confirm Order'? Wait, no. Let's think.

Wait, the sequence is Approve (A), then Create (C), then Confirm (CO). So for a row where activity is CO, we need to check that the previous activity (LAG 1) is C, and the one before that (LAG 2) is A, and all three are consecutive in the case's timeline. But how to ensure that there are no other events in between? Because if there's an event between A and C, then the LAG might not capture it. So maybe ordering the events by timestamp and ensuring that the next two events after A are C then CO.

Alternatively, for each case, group the events in order and check for the existence of such a trio. But that's tricky. Maybe using a window with ROW_NUMBER() partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp. Then, for each row, check if the current activity is CO, the previous is C, and the one before that is A, and their row numbers are consecutive.

So, for example:

WITH ranked_events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_num
  FROM event_log
)
SELECT 
  el.case_id
FROM ranked_events el
WHERE el.activity = 'Confirm Order'
AND LAG(el.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num) = 'Create Order'
AND LAG(el.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num) = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND LAG(el.row_num, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num) = el.row_num - 1
AND LAG(el.row_num, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num) = el.row_num - 2
;

Wait, but the row_num is consecutive by definition within each case, since it's ordered by timestamp. So if the row numbers are consecutive, then there are no events in between. So for the three events A, C, CO, their row numbers would be n, n+1, n+2. So when checking for the CO row (row_num = n+2), the LAG 1 would be n+1 (C), LAG 2 would be n (A), and the row numbers are consecutive. So the condition would be that for a CO event, the previous activity is C, the one before that is A, and their row numbers are exactly one less and two less. Since row_num is assigned in order, this ensures no gaps.

So the first part is to find all case_ids where such a trio exists. Then, among those cases, check the time between C and CO. So for each such case, we need to find the timestamp of C and CO in the sequence and compute the difference.

But how to link the C and CO in the sequence. Since the trio is consecutive, the CO event's timestamp minus the C event's timestamp should be more than 5 days. Wait, but the problem says the time between C and CO in the sequence must be more than 5 days. So for the case to be excluded, it must have the sequence and the time between C and CO in that sequence is >5 days.

So first, find all cases with the sequence. Then, for those cases, check if in their sequence, the time between C and CO is >5 days. If both conditions are met, exclude all events of that case.

So the steps are:

1. Identify cases with the sequence A -> C -> CO consecutively.

2. For those cases, check if the duration between C and CO in the sequence is >5 days.

3. Exclude all events from cases that meet both conditions.

So the query needs to first find the cases that meet both conditions, then exclude them.

How to structure this.

First, create a CTE that identifies the cases with the sequence. Then, another CTE that for those cases, checks the time condition. Then, exclude those cases from the original event_log.

But how to link the time condition. Let's think.

Once we have the cases with the sequence, for each such case, we need to find the pair of C and CO events in the sequence and calculate their timestamp difference.

But since the sequence is consecutive, the C event is the one before CO in the sequence. So for each case with the sequence, the CO event's timestamp minus the previous (C) event's timestamp should be >5 days.

So perhaps, for the cases in the first CTE, we can join the event_log again to get the C and CO timestamps.

Alternatively, in the first CTE, when we find the CO event that is part of the sequence, we can get the timestamp of C (using LAG) and compute the difference.

Wait, in the first CTE, when we select the CO events that are part of the sequence, we can also include the LAG(timestamp, 1) as the C's timestamp. Then, compute the difference between the current timestamp (CO) and the LAG timestamp (C). If that difference is more than 5 days, then the case is to be excluded.

So the first CTE would find all CO events that are part of the sequence, and for each, check the time difference. Then, collect the case_ids from those rows where the difference is >5 days.

So putting it all together:

First, create a CTE that finds all cases where the sequence exists and the time between C and CO is >5 days.

Then, select all events from event_log where the case_id is not in that CTE.

So the steps in SQL:

1. Create a ranked-events CTE with row numbers per case.

2. Find CO events where the previous activity is C, the one before that is A, and row numbers are consecutive. Also, compute the time difference between CO and C.

3. Filter those CO events where the time difference is >5 days, and collect their case_ids.

4. Select all events from event_log where case_id is not in the excluded case_ids.

Now, let's structure the SQL.

First, the ranked events:

WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_num
  FROM event_log
),

-- Find cases with the sequence and time condition
excluded_cases AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id
  FROM ranked r
  WHERE r.activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND LAG(r.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num) = 'Create Order'
  AND LAG(r.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num) = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND (r.timestamp - LAG(r.timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num)) > INTERVAL '5 day'
)

-- Main query: select all events not in excluded_cases
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases);

Wait, but the excluded_cases CTE is selecting case_ids where the CO event has the required sequence and the time difference between CO and C is >5 days. So each such case_id in excluded_cases should be excluded.

But what if a case has multiple such sequences? For example, a case could have two separate sequences of A-C-CO. Then, the excluded_cases CTE would include the case_id once for each occurrence. But since we're using NOT IN, it's okay because the case_id would be present once, and all events from that case are excluded.

So this should work.

But wait, the LAG functions in the excluded_cases CTE: when we check LAG(r.activity, 1), since we're partitioning by case_id and ordering by row_num, which is consecutive, the LAG(1) would be the previous row in the case's timeline. So for the CO event (row_num n), LAG(1) is C (n-1), LAG(2) is A (n-2). The row numbers are consecutive, so no events in between.

So the excluded_cases CTE correctly identifies case_ids that have at least one occurrence of the sequence with the time condition.

Then, the main query selects all events from cases not in excluded_cases.

But wait, the problem says to exclude cases that meet both the sequence and the time condition. So the excluded_cases CTE correctly captures those case_ids.

Yes.

Now, testing edge cases. For example, a case that has the sequence but the time difference is exactly 5 days: it's not excluded. Only those with more than 5 days.

Another edge case: a case that has the sequence multiple times. As long as at least one of those sequences meets the time condition, the entire case is excluded.

Yes, because the excluded_cases CTE would include the case_id once, and NOT IN would exclude all events from that case.

So the final query should be:

WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_num
  FROM event_log
),
excluded_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id  -- To avoid duplicates if multiple sequences
  FROM ranked r
  WHERE r.activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND LAG(r.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num) = 'Create Order'
  AND LAG(r.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num) = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND (r.timestamp - LAG(r.timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY row_num)) > INTERVAL '5 day'
)
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases);

Wait, but in the excluded_cases CTE, if a case has multiple CO events that meet the conditions, the SELECT would return the case_id multiple times. Using DISTINCT would ensure it's only once. So adding DISTINCT is better to avoid redundant entries.

Yes, that's a good point. So the excluded_cases CTE should SELECT DISTINCT case_id.

Now, putting it all together.

But wait, in DuckDB, the window function LAG can be used in the WHERE clause? Or do we need to wrap it in a subquery or CTE?

Yes, in DuckDB, window functions can be used in the WHERE clause, but only if they are part of a subquery or CTE. Wait, no. Window functions are evaluated after the WHERE clause, so you can't use them directly in the WHERE. So the approach of using a CTE (like the ranked CTE) and then applying the window functions in the next CTE (excluded_cases) is correct.

So the code should work.

Testing another scenario: a case that has A, then some other activity, then C, then CO. Then, the LAG(1) for CO would be C, but LAG(2) would be the other activity, so it's not selected. So the sequence is not consecutive, so the case is not excluded.

Another case: A, C, X, CO. Then, the CO's LAG(1) is X, so not matched.

So the code correctly requires that the three activities are consecutive.

Now, the time difference calculation: (r.timestamp - LAG(r.timestamp, 1)) gives the interval between CO and C. If that's more than 5 days, then the condition is met.

Yes.

So the final query should be as written.
