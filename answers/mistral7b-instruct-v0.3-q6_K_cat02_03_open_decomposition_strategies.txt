 Decomposition strategies can be beneficial in large-scale process mining projects for several reasons:

1. **Scalability**: By breaking down a complex process into smaller, manageable parts, you can handle larger volumes of data more efficiently. This reduces the computational resources required and speeds up analysis time.

2. **Understandability**: Decomposition helps in gaining a clearer understanding of the overall process by focusing on specific sub-processes or activities. This can make the results easier to interpret and actionable for process improvement.

3. **Focused Analysis**: Decomposing allows you to prioritize areas of the process that need the most attention based on performance metrics like cycle time, frequency, or cost.

4. **Modularity**: If changes occur in one part of the process, decomposition can help minimize the impact on other parts, making it easier to manage and implement improvements.

However, there are also challenges associated with using decomposition strategies:

1. **Complexity**: The process of decomposition itself can be complex, requiring careful planning and coordination to ensure that all parts are accurately represented and interconnected.

2. **Over-segmentation**: Overly dividing the process into too many parts might lead to loss of context and make it difficult to understand the overall flow of the process.

3. **Inconsistent Data**: Large-scale process mining projects often deal with incomplete or inconsistent data, which can affect the accuracy of the decomposition and subsequent analysis.

4. **Time and Resource Intensive**: Decomposition can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially in large-scale projects where there are many potential sub-processes to consider.

5. **Integration**: Ensuring that the various decomposed parts are integrated effectively to create an accurate overall picture of the process can be challenging.
