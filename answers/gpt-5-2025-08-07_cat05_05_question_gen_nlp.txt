1. How do we balance cost advantages of globally dispersed sourcing against resilience to geopolitical, trade, or natural-disaster risks, and what specific contingency plans exist for sudden disruptions at key suppliers (e.g., Taiwan, Japan, South Korea)?
2. Which factors contribute most to end-to-end lead time variability (supplier production, customs, transport, factory throughput), and how can we systematically reduce variance without undermining quality or flexibility?
3. Where should we position postponement/decoupling points (e.g., localization, final packaging, firmware) to better absorb regional demand volatility and shorten effective lead times?
4. How do our demand-forecasting and inventory ML models perform during new product launches, promotions, or black swan events, and what governance controls address bias, drift, and explainability?
5. What multi-echelon inventory policies best balance service levels, working capital, and obsolescence risk across fast- and slow-moving markets, and how do we dynamically adjust safety stocks?
6. How do mode choices (air vs. ocean; direct vs. transshipment) affect total landed cost, OTIF performance, and carbon footprint, and what decision triggers should switch modes in real time?
7. What is our strategy for dual-sourcing/second-source qualification of critical parts (chipsets, OLEDs, camera modules), and how do tooling, IP, and certification timelines constrain agility?
8. How do currency fluctuations, interest rates, and inflation across regions impact margins and cash flow, and what hedging, pricing, and contract structures mitigate exposure?
9. Where do quality escapes still occur despite in-line testing, and how do we integrate field telemetry, returns data, and social listening to rapidly detect defects and execute targeted recalls?
10. How are environmental, social, and labor standards monitored and enforced beyond tier-1 suppliers, and what audit, traceability, and remediation mechanisms ensure compliance and credibility?
11. What is our capacity strategy at the Malaysia plant (shifts, flexible lines, overtime), and how do we allocate scarce components during shortages to maximize enterprise value and customer impact?
12. How well are ERP, PLM, MES, WMS, and TMS integrated, and where do data latency or quality issues create bullwhip effects or decision lags across planning and execution?
13. What level of serialization and component-to-finished-goods traceability do we have to combat counterfeiting, support warranty analytics, and comply with right-to-repair and take-back rules?
14. How should our global network design (DC locations, cross-docks, FTZs) evolve under alternative demand, tariff, and pandemic scenarios, and what are the cost-to-serve implications by channel?
15. What governance and cadence do we use for S&OP/IBP, which KPIs truly drive outcomes (OTIF, forecast accuracy, inventory turns, CO2/unit), and how are exceptions escalated and resolved?
16. How do we integrate reverse logistics (returns, refurbish, part harvesting, recycling) with forward flows to improve circularity, margin recovery, and regulatory compliance?
17. What cybersecurity controls and third-party risk practices protect supplier portals, EDI, IoT devices, and cloud planning tools from disruptions or data breaches?
18. Which incoterms, customs brokerage strategies, and insurance coverages best balance risk allocation, cash conversion, and claims recovery across lanes and partners?
19. How do we segment SKUs and markets to decide between just-in-time replenishment and consolidated monthly shipments, and what metrics trigger switching policies over time?
20. What upcoming regulatory shifts (e.g., EU Battery Regulation, right-to-repair, extended producer responsibility) will reshape product design, sourcing choices, after-sales operations, and total cost?
