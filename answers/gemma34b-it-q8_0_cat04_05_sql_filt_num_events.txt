```duckdb
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inner Query (Subquery):**
   - `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`
   - This subquery identifies the `case_id` values that have six or fewer events.
   - `GROUP BY case_id` groups the events by `case_id`.
   - `COUNT(*)` counts the number of events within each group (i.e., for each `case_id`).
   - `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` filters the groups, keeping only those where the event count is less than or equal to 6.

2. **Outer Query:**
   - `SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (...)`
   - This query selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table.
   - `WHERE case_id IN (...)` filters the rows based on the `case_id` values returned by the subquery.  It only includes rows where the `case_id` is present in the list of `case_id`s that have six or fewer events.

**Alternative (using a Common Table Expression - CTE):**

This approach can be more readable, especially for more complex queries:

```duckdb
WITH CasesWithLimitedEvents AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesWithLimitedEvents);
```

This CTE version does the same thing as the first query, but it breaks the logic into two steps, making it easier to understand.  The `WITH` clause defines a temporary named result set called `CasesWithLimitedEvents`.

**Why this solution is correct:**

* **Correct Grouping:** The `GROUP BY case_id` clause ensures that events are grouped by the case they belong to.
* **Accurate Filtering:** The `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` clause correctly filters out cases with more than six events.
* **Complete Result:** The `WHERE case_id IN (...)` clause ensures that only events from the remaining cases (those with six or fewer events) are returned.
* **DuckDB Compatibility:** The query uses standard DuckDB SQL syntax and should execute without issues in a DuckDB environment.
