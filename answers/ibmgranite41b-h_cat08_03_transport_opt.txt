# Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing & Integration 

**Objective:** Consolidate disparate data streams (GPS tracks, driver scanners, dispatch logs, maintenance records) into a unified event log suitable for process mining analysis.

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicate entries, handle missing values, and standardize timestamps across systems. Convert all time stamps to a uniform format (e.g., ISO 8601).
- **Event Normalization**: Ensure consistent naming conventions for events such as “Arrive Customer” vs. “Scan at Depot”. Create standardized case identifiers that link vehicle-day activity.
- **Temporal Alignment**: Use GPS timestamp granularity and align it with scanner timestamps where possible to capture precise delivery milestones.

**Challenges:** 
- Inconsistent data schemas across systems (different field names, formats).
- Delays in real-time transmission of event logs from vehicles or scanners may require buffering mechanisms for consistency.
- Integration between legacy dispatch system outputs and newer GPS/maintenance records may necessitate ETL processes to ensure seamless integration.

### Process Discovery 

**Techniques**: Utilize process discovery algorithms such as Data Flow Analysis (DFA) or Graph Pattern Matching on the integrated event log. Tools like Celonis, Dynatrace, or proprietary logistics-specific software can be employed for this purpose.

- **Visualization of Actual Delivery Process:** The discovered model will depict a flowchart representing end-to-end delivery activities—from depot departure to return visits—highlighting key events such as vehicle start/stop times, scan acknowledgments, and customer interactions. Visualization aids in understanding where delays or deviations occur.
  
**Comparison with Planned Routes:**
- **Conformance Checking**: Compare the discovered process model against planned routes (including expected stop sequences, delivery windows) to identify discrepancies like unplanned stops, excessive travel times, or route deviations for maintenance.

### Types of Deviations 

Key categories include:

- Sequence Deviations: Unexpected sequence jumps in vehicle operations—e.g., a departure from depot without completing required scan milestones.
- Unplanned Stops: Instances where vehicles deviate from planned routes due to traffic congestion, delivery delays, or unscheduled maintenance stops. 
- Significant Timing Differences: Delays exceeding predefined thresholds (e.g., >15 minutes) between critical events.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
1. **On-Time Delivery Rate**: Percentage of deliveries completed within the requested time window.
2. **Average Time per Stop**: Total travel or waiting time divided by number of stops, providing insight into operational efficiency at each stage.
3. **Travel vs. Service Ratio**: Measuring service delivery speed relative to actual driving times helps evaluate if delays stem from movement inefficiencies rather than customer interactions.

**Techniques for Bottleneck Identification:**
- **Event Sequence Analysis:** Use graph pattern mining or sequence alignment algorithms to identify repeated patterns of events that may indicate bottlenecks.
  
  - *Traffic Hotspots*: Correlate GPS location data with traffic congestion alerts (e.g., from public APIs) to pinpoint routes congested during specific times. 
  - *Driver Performance Variability*: Analyze variance in driver response times across similar locations or time slots, possibly correlating this with training records.
  
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Employ variant analysis techniques comparing high-performing vs. low-performing delivery sequences/drivers to uncover systematic inefficiencies (e.g., frequent stops at specific addresses).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

**Potential Root Causes:**

1. **Dynamic Routing Issues:** Static route plans may not adapt quickly enough to real-time traffic changes, leading to congestion-induced delays.
2. **Travel Time Estimations**: GPS data might not always reflect current conditions (e.g., accidents), causing overestimation of travel times and unnecessary detours.
3. **Customer Interaction Variability:** Delays caused by customer unavailability or location accessibility issues can inflate service time beyond expected delivery windows.

**Specific Process Mining Analyses:**
- *Variant Analysis*: Compare performance metrics across routes/drivers that show higher-than-average delays, highlighting suboptimal practices in those segments.
  
  - Example: Identify drivers who frequently experience missed stops due to traffic congestion and correlate this with real-time GPS data during peak hours.
  
- **Correlation Studies**: Analyze event logs alongside weather or incident datasets (e.g., from government APIs) for correlations that could explain observed delay patterns.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy Proposals:

1. **Dynamic Routing Adjustments:**
   - *Implementation*: Deploy real-time traffic and GPS data analysis platforms to modify routes dynamically based on congestion levels, delivery windows, or vehicle availability.
   - *Impact on KPIs*: Expected improvement in On-Time Delivery Rate through reduced travel times; decreased Fuel Consumption due to optimized paths.

2. **Dynamic Route Sequencing:**
   - *Implementation*: Optimize stop sequences based on historical performance data (e.g., high-risk delivery zones, time windows).
   - *Root Cause Addressed*: Unplanned stops and unnecessary delays caused by inefficient order management or suboptimal route planning.
   
3. **Improved Time Window Management & Communication:**
   - *Implementation*: Develop automated notification systems that alert drivers of imminent customer unavailability via SMS/email synchronization with GPS data tracking. 
   - *Impact on KPIs*: Reduction in failed deliveries, leading to higher On-Time Delivery Rates; enhanced Customer Satisfaction through reliable communication.

4. **Predictive Maintenance Scheduling:**
   - *Implementation*: Use vehicle usage patterns (e.g., mileage, speed) and maintenance logs identified from the process mining analysis to schedule preventative maintenance proactively.
   - *Impact on KPIs*: Decreased unexpected downtime reducing travel times; reduced unplanned repairs enhancing overall operational uptime.

5. **Targeted Driver Training:**
   - *Implementation*: Use case studies derived from variant analyses of high-performing delivery routes/drivers, coupled with real-time feedback mechanisms during operations to coach drivers.
   - *Impact on KPIs*:

     Improved efficiency and punctuality by reinforcing best practices identified in successful scenarios.

## 5. Considering Operational Constraints & Monitoring

**Operational Constraints:**
- **Driver Working Hours**: Ensure that proposed changes respect mandated working hour limits, potentially requiring flexible scheduling algorithms or additional staffing for peak demand periods.
- **Vehicle Capacities**: Adjust route planning to accommodate varying vehicle loads while minimizing empty runs and maintaining operational efficiencies.

### Continuous Monitoring Plan:

1. **Process Mining Dashboards:**
   - Visualize KPI performance in real-time; set up alerts for deviations exceeding predefined thresholds (e.g., missed deliveries, significant timing differences).
   
2. **Automated Reporting**: 
   - Generate weekly/monthly reports summarizing delivery metrics and trends identified through process mining.
   - Include root cause analysis outcomes to provide actionable feedback loops.

3. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Utilize dashboard data for ongoing driver training sessions; integrate customer satisfaction surveys with operational insights for continuous improvement cycles.
   
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: 
   - Regularly compare current performance metrics against historical baselines (pre-optimization period) and set targets based on industry benchmarks or competitors.
