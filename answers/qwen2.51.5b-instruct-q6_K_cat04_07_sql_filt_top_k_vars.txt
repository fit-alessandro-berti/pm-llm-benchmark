To achieve the described task in DuckDB, we will follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Ordered Sequence of Activities for Each Case:**
   We need a query that orders activities by `timestamp` within each case.

2. **Aggregate and Count Cases Per Variant:**
   Use aggregation to count cases per unique variant (ordered activity sequence).

3. **Filter Down to Top K Variants:**
   Determine which variants have the most cases, filtering out others.

4. **Return Events from Top K Variants Only:**
   Select events that belong only to those top K variants.

Here is how you can achieve this in a single DuckDB query:

```sql
WITH 
-- Step 1: Extract ordered sequences of activities per case
event_log AS (
    SELECT 
        `case_id`, 
        activity, 
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY `case_id` ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
-- Step 2: Aggregate and count cases per variant
variants_count AS (
    SELECT 
        `case_id`,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp ASC) AS ordered_activities,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE case_id = ANY(ROW_NUMBER())) OVER (PARTITION BY ordered_activities) AS variant_cases
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY `case_id`, ordered_activities
),
-- Step 3: Identify top K variants based on the number of cases per variant
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        ordered_activities,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE case_id = ANY(ROW_NUMBER())) OVER (PARTITION BY ordered_activities) AS count
    FROM variants_count
    GROUP BY ordered_activities
),
-- Step 4: Return events from top K variants only
final_results AS (
    SELECT 
        e.*
    FROM event_log e
    INNER JOIN variants_count vc ON e.`case_id` = vc.`case_id`
    WHERE vc.ordered_activities IN (SELECT ordered_activities FROM top_k_variants)
)

SELECT *
FROM final_results;
```

### Explanation:
1. **event_log CTE**: We first create a subquery to assign row numbers within each case `PARTITION BY`, ordering by timestamp.
   
2. **variants_count CTE**: This step groups the events by `case_id` and orders activities, then counts the number of cases that follow each ordered sequence (variant).

3. **top_k_variants CTE**: Here we identify which variants have the most cases (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE case_id = ANY(ROW_NUMBER())) OVER (PARTITION BY ordered_activities) AS count`) by grouping them.

4. **final_results CTE**: This step joins the original events with the variant counts, filtering to include only those variants that have more than one case and selects all activities from those matching cases.

5. **Final Selection**: The result is selected containing all events from the `event_log` table that belong to top K variants.

This query ensures you get a comprehensive view of how each unique sequence (variant) of activities for processes within your event log fits together, grouped by their frequency and filtered down to only include the most relevant ones.
