**Explanation:**

- **Material Preparation**: This high-level step encapsulates all the activities related to preparing the raw material (M-045 and M-046) for further processing. These include scanning a barcode, placing the sheet on a table, aligning it, and preheating it, which are standard procedures in the preparation phase.

- **Assembly**: The assembly high-level step groups the sequence of events where a welding tool is picked up, followed by the actual welding of corners A and B. This logically follows with a quality inspection step (Measure weld integrity and Visual check) to ensure the welds meet specifications. Applying and drying the protective coating also appears as part of this high-level activity since it directly follows the welding process.

- **Quality Inspection**: The final high-level step encompasses all events related to assessing the quality of the manufactured item, including a visual check, which is performed by different operators (B2 and C) after various manufacturing stages.

This structured grouping adheres to the principles of clustering temporally close events, ensuring activities are conducted in sequence, and recognizing that certain actions (e.g., welding followed by inspection) are integral parts of larger process steps. The naming of these high-level activities is consistent with standard industry terminology for such processes.
