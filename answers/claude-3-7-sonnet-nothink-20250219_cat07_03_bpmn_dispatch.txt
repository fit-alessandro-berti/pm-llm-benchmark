This image shows a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram depicting a shipping process workflow across three organizational lanes: Logistics, Department of Computer Hardware Shop (Secretary), and Warehouse.

The process flow is as follows:

1. The process begins with "Ship goods" in the Secretary lane.
2. The first step is to "Clarify shipment method."
3. After clarification, the process branches based on whether "Special handling" is required:
   - If "yes," the flow moves to "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" followed by "Select logistic company and place order"
   - If "no," the flow checks if insurance is required using customer information from a database

4. The "Check if insurance is required" step has two outcomes:
   - If insurance is necessary, the process moves to the Logistics lane to "Insure parcel"
   - In all cases ("always" path), the process continues to "Write package label"

5. In parallel with the Secretary lane activities, the Warehouse lane shows:
   - "Package goods" (with a 48-hour timer)
   - If packaging exceeds 48 hours, "Notify customer about delay"

6. After the Secretary lane completes its tasks and the package is ready, the process converges in the Warehouse lane to:
   - "Fill out Shipment paperwork"
   - "Move package to pickup area"
   - End with "Shipment prepared"

The diagram effectively illustrates the cross-functional responsibilities and decision points in the shipping process, showing how different departments coordinate to prepare a shipment from initial order to final preparation for pickup by the logistics provider.
