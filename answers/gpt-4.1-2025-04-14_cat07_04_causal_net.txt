### **Summary**

The image presents a **Petri net diagram**, which is commonly used for modeling business processes and workflows. It visually depicts the flow of activities within a process, using places (circles), transitions (rectangles), and directed arcs.

---

### **Main Diagram (Process Model)**

- **Activities/Transitions (Rectangles with labels):**
  - **a**: register request
  - **b**: examine thoroughly
  - **c**: examine casually
  - **d**: check ticket
  - **e**: decide
  - **f**: reinitiate request
  - **g**: pay compensation
  - **h**: reject request
  - **z**: end

- **Places (Small black circles):**
  - Represent temporary or intermediate states, serving as connectors between activities.
  - Tokens flow through these circles, enabling transitions (activities) to "fire."

- **Arcs (Directed Arrows):**
  - Indicate the process flow, connecting activities via places.
  - Show possible sequences and choices for progressing through the process.

#### **General Process Flow:**
1. The process starts at **a (register request)**.
2. Three possible subsequent activities: **b** (thorough), **c** (casual), or **d** (check).
3. After these, activities converge toward **e (decide)**.
4. If a decision is made, the process may:
   - Proceed to **f (reinitiate request)** and loop back for further review,
   - Or move to the conclusion phase, either to **g (pay compensation)** or **h (reject request)**.
5. Both **g** and **h** lead to **z (end)**.

### **Legend (Bottom-Right Corner)**

The legend illustrates different types of workflow patterns using the Petri net notation:

- **XOR-split**: One of several possible paths is chosen.
- **AND-split**: Multiple paths are taken simultaneously.
- **OR-split**: Any combination of the outgoing paths may be taken.
- **XOR-join**: The process waits for one incoming path.
- **AND-join**: The process waits for all incoming paths.
- **OR-join**: The process waits for any combination of incoming paths.

These patterns correspond to decision points or parallelism in a process.

### **Overall Purpose**

This visualization provides a **formal model of a case management/business process** using Petri net principles, highlighting possible execution paths, rework cycles, choices, and parallel activities.
