# Analysis of Process Violations

## Summary of Violations

**Compliant Cases:** Case 1, Case 4  
**Non-Compliant Cases:** Case 2, Case 3, Case 5

## Detailed Analysis

### **Case 1:  COMPLIANT**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This case perfectly follows the normative process for orders with sufficient inventory. All activities occur in the correct sequence as prescribed.

---

### **Case 2:  VIOLATION**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items**  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** Activities are executed out of order.

**Explanation:** 
The normative description explicitly states that "Authorize payment" should occur "before packaging" and that "Package items should only occur after authorization." In Case 2, items are packaged at 10:00 before payment is authorized at 10:30. This violates the fundamental principle that payment authorization must be confirmed before committing resources to prepare items for shipment. The process should not invest effort in packaging until financial approval is secured.

### **Case 3:  MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order**  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violations:** 
1. Shipping after cancellation
2. Missing mandatory "Package items" activity before shipping
3. Inconsistent process branch (authorization followed by cancellation)

**Explanation:**
This case contains the most serious violations:
- The normative description explicitly states: "Ship order should only occur **after packaging and never after cancellation**" and "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)."
- After canceling the order at 10:00, the process continues to ship it at 10:30, which is fundamentally contradictory.
- Additionally, the "Package items" activity is completely missing, yet shipping occurs anyway.
- The sequence also suggests process confusion: if inventory was insufficient (leading to cancellation), why was payment authorized first?

### **Case 4:  COMPLIANT**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This case correctly follows the normative process for orders with insufficient inventory. The process appropriately branches to cancellation after the inventory check and proceeds directly to closure without any fulfillment activities.

---

### **Case 5:  VIOLATION**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violation:** Missing mandatory "Package items" activity.

**Explanation:**
The normative description states that "Package items should only occur after authorization and **before shipping**" and "'Ship order' should only occur **after packaging**." Case 5 skips the packaging activity entirely, jumping directly from payment authorization to shipping. The description establishes packaging as a necessary prerequisite for shipping: "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" Without this activity, the items cannot logically be shipped, making this a violation of the required process sequence.

## Conclusion

Three out of five cases (Cases 2, 3, and 5) violate the normative process. The violations involve incorrect activity ordering, executing fulfillment activities after cancellation, and skipping mandatory activities. These deviations represent failures to follow the prescribed control flow and logical constraints of the order handling process.
