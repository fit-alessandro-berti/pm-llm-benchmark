The process represents a logistics operation involving multiple objects and activities. Here is a description of the major steps:

1. Register Customer Order: A customer order is registered within the system, likely involving details such as what goods are requested and the delivery address.

2. Create Transport Document: Once the customer order is registered, a transport document is created. This document likely includes information about the freight, such as type of goods, quantity, and destination, and serves as a record for the entire logistics process.

3. Book Vehicles: After creating the transport document, the company then books vehicles to provide transport for the goods. This might involve assigning specific trucks or other vehicles for the transportation.

4. Order Empty Containers: To prepare for loading goods, empty containers are ordered. This is likely done in advance to have containers available for packaging the goods.

5. Pick Up Empty Containers: The empty containers are fetched, likely from a storage area. This activity is closely associated with the order for empty containers and indicates the initial step in the physical movement of the logistics process.

6. Load Trucks: Goods are collected from the storage and are loaded onto the trucks that were previously booked. This involves arranging and securing the cargo onto the trucks for safe and efficient transportation.

7. Drive to Terminal: Trucks are driven to the terminal, which could be an internal warehouse, distribution center, or a shipping port. This step is essential for further processing and eventually transporting the goods.

8. Weigh Goods: At the terminal, the weight of the goods is measured, possibly for billing or shipping purposes. This step ensures that the weight information on the transport document is accurate.

9. Place in Stock: Goods that have been weighed and possibly inspected may be placed in stock, either for temporary storage or waiting for further processing.

10. Load Containers to Vehicles: Prepared containers are then loaded onto shipping vehicles. This includes placing containers onto specific transport modes like trucks, trains, or ships.

11. Depart: Once all necessary preparation and loading has been completed, the vehicles carrying the goods will depart from the terminal, embarking on their journey to the destination.

12. Reschedule Containers: Occasionally, containers may need to be rescheduled for various reasons, such as significant delays or changes in shipping plans. This involves modifying the timeline or transportation method for the containers.

13. Bring to Loading Bay: After goods have been processed (weighed, stocked, etc.), they may be moved to the loading bay to be easily accessed for loading onto vehicles.

14. Collect
