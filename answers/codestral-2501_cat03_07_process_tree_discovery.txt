To create a process tree that captures the observed behavior from the given event log, we need to identify the main sequence of activities, the optional repeating loop for requesting missing information and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival. Here is a structured process tree that balances fitness, precision, and simplicity:

```
+ ( 'Receive Application (RA)',
    -> ( 'Validate Form (VF)',
        * ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
            'Validate Form (VF)' ),
        -> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
            -> ( 'Approval Decision (AD)',
                -> ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)',
                    'Archive Case (AC)' ) ) ) ) )
```

### Explanation:

1. **Parallel Execution (`+`) of 'Receive Application (RA)' and the subsequent sequence:**
   - `+ ( 'Receive Application (RA)', ... )`
   - This indicates that 'Receive Application (RA)' can be executed in true concurrency with the rest of the process.

2. **Sequence (`->`) of activities after 'Receive Application (RA)':**
   - `-> ( 'Validate Form (VF)', ... )`
   - This ensures that 'Validate Form (VF)' is executed before the subsequent activities.

3. **Loop (`*`) for 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' and re-validation:**
   - `* ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' )`
   - This loop allows for multiple iterations of 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' followed by 'Validate Form (VF)' until the loop is exited.

4. **Sequence (`->`) of activities after the loop:**
   - `-> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', ... )`
   - This ensures that 'Assess Eligibility (AE)' is executed after the loop.

5. **Further sequence (`->`) of activities after 'Assess Eligibility (AE)':**
   - `-> ( 'Approval Decision (AD)', ... )`
   - This ensures that 'Approval Decision (AD)' is executed after 'Assess Eligibility (AE)'.

6. **Final sequence (`->`) of activities after 'Approval Decision (AD)':**
   - `-> ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 'Archive Case (AC)' )`
   - This ensures that 'Send Confirmation (SC)' is executed before 'Archive Case (AC)'.

This process tree captures the main flow of the process, including the optional repeating loop for requesting missing information and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival.
