Based on the given event log, the process tree should capture the following behavior:

1. **Main Sequence**: The process typically starts with "Receive Application (RA)", followed by "Validate Form (VF)", "Assess Eligibility (AE)", and then either proceeds to approval or enters a loop for requesting missing information.
2. **Optional Loop**: After "Assess Eligibility (AE)", there may be a loop where "Request Missing Info (RMI)" is executed, followed by another "Validate Form (VF)". This loop can repeat multiple times (as seen in Case 3) or not occur at all (as in Case 2).
3. **Final Steps**: After the loop (if any), the process proceeds to "Approval Decision (AD)", "Send Confirmation (SC)", and finally "Archive Case (AC)".

### Final Process Tree Structure:
```
-> (
    'RA',
    -> (
        'VF',
        -> (
            'AE',
            * (
                tau,
                -> (
                    'RMI',
                    'VF'
                )
            ),
            -> (
                'AD',
                -> (
                    'SC',
                    'AC'
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sequence (`->`)**:
   - The process starts with "RA", followed by a sequence of "VF" and "AE".
2. **Loop (`*`)**:
   - After "AE", there is a loop where:
     - The process can silently exit (`tau`) or enter a sequence of "RMI" followed by "VF".
     - This loop can repeat (as seen in Case 3, where "RMI" occurs twice).
3. **Final Sequence**:
   - After the loop, the process continues with "AD", "SC", and "AC" in sequence.

### Visual Representation:
```
        ->
       /   \
     RA     ->
           /   \
         VF     ->
               /   \
             AE     *
                  / | \
                tau -> AD
                    /   \
                  RMI   VF
```

This model captures:
- The mandatory sequence of RA → VF → AE.
- The optional and repeatable RMI → VF loop.
- The final sequence AD → SC → AC.

The loop ensures that the model fits cases where missing information is requested multiple times (like Case 3) or not at all (like Case 2). The silent transition (`tau`) allows exiting the loop directly to "AD".
