This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** illustrating the end-to-end process for shipping goods, likely for a computer hardware shop. The process is organized across three organizational lanes (pools): **Logistics**, **Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop / Secretary**, and **Warehouse**.

The process begins with the **Start Event** "Ship goods" in the Secretary/Dispatch lane.

### Process Flow Breakdown

**1. Initial Parallel Split and Shipment Clarification:**
Immediately after starting, an **Inclusive Gateway (Start)** indicates that two main tracks can begin simultaneously:
*   The administrative track proceeds to the **Secretary** to "Clarify shipment method."
*   The physical track proceeds directly to the **Warehouse** to "Package goods."

**2. Administrative/Logistics Coordination (Secretary & Logistics Lanes):**

*   **Shipment Decision:** After clarifying the method, the Secretary encounters an **Exclusive Gateway (Special handling?)**.
    *   **If NO:** The process flows directly to the insurance check.
    *   **If YES:** The process requires external coordination: "Get 3 offers from logistic companies," followed by "Select logistic company and place order."

*   **Insurance Handling:** Regardless of the special handling path, the process moves to "Check if insurance is required," referencing "Customer information." This leads to an **Inclusive Gateway**:
    *   If insurance is necessary, the flow moves to the **Logistics Lane** to execute the task **"Insure parcel."**
    *   The flow then merges back, indicating that regardless of insurance status, the next step is always executed.

*   **Labeling and Merging:** The next step is "Write package label." This flow then merges with the path coming from the logistic company selection (if applicable) at an **Exclusive Gateway (X)** before proceeding downward.

**3. Warehouse Activities (Physical Preparation):**

*   The **Warehouse** task "Package goods" is executed in parallel with the administrative tasks.
*   An artifact indicates a time constraint: packaging should take less than **"48 hours."**
*   If the packaging exceeds 48 hours (implied by the timer flow), the process executes **"Notify customer about delay."**

**4. Synchronization and Completion:**

*   The administrative/logistics path (documentation, labeling, ordering) and the physical preparation path (packaging, potential delay notification) must synchronize before final preparation.
*   These flows meet at an **Inclusive Gateway (Plus)**, combining the documentation requirement with the packaged goods.
*   The synchronized flow proceeds to:
    1.  "Fill out Shipment paperwork."
    2.  "Move package to pickup area."

The process concludes successfully with the **End Event** "Shipment prepared."
