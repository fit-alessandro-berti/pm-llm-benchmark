 Based on the provided directly follows graph from the object-centric event log, some process and data specific considerations that could be contributing to performance issues include:

1. Object type: Truck
* "Load Truck" followed by "Load Truck" on the same object is happening frequently (8559 times) with a duration of 5259.71. This could indicate that there are inefficiencies in the loading process or that there is unnecessary downtime between loading events.
* "Drive to Terminal" to "Load Truck" transition has a high frequency (1988) but also has a long duration (84119.09). This could suggest there are inefficiencies in the terminal loading process or traffic conditions on the route that could be addressed.
1. Object type: Container
* There is a high frequency of "Order Empty Containers" (1995) followed by "Pick Up Empty Container" (1994) with a long duration (368943.92). This might indicate that there are inefficiencies in the container ordering process or that the procurement time of empty containers is lengthy.
* The duration for "Place in Stock" (1960.09) after "Weigh" (1814 occurrences) is relatively low. However, the high frequency of "Place in Stock" followed by "Bring to Loading Bay" (1794 occurrences) has a significant duration (743380.51), indicating that there might be an issue with the container placement process or scheduling.
* There is a high frequency of "Bring to Loading Bay" (1931) followed by "Load to Vehicle" (1956), but the duration (2428.91) is low. This suggests that the container placement and loading process may have minor bottlenecks, but the overall frequency suggests there may be other areas causing the performance issues.
1. Object type: Vehicle
* There is a high frequency of "Book Vehicles" followed by "Load to Vehicle" (122 occurrences) with a long duration (283101.01). This could indicate an issue with efficient vehicle allocation and the loading process.
* "
