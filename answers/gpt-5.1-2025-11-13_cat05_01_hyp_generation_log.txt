Below is a prompt you can give to another LLM that has access to this PostgreSQL database. It includes the schema, example data, and clear instructions about the type of analysis you want (anomalies, hypotheses, and investigative SQL).

You are connected to a PostgreSQL database with the following schema.

### Schema

**Table:** `order_event_log`  
Columns:  
- `case_id` (INTEGER) – Identifies a particular order  
- `event_id` (INTEGER) – Primary key for event records  
- `activity` (VARCHAR) – Name of the event/activity in the process  
- `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP) – When the activity took place  
- `resource` (VARCHAR) – The person/system performing the activity  
- `additional_info` (VARCHAR) – Additional context, e.g., amounts, reason codes  

**Table:** `orders`  
Columns:  
- `case_id` (INTEGER) – Matches `order_event_log.case_id`  
- `customer_id` (INTEGER) – Identifies the customer  
- `order_type` (VARCHAR) – E.g., standard, priority  
- `order_value` (DECIMAL) – Monetary value of the order  

**Table:** `resources`  
Columns:  
- `resource_id` (VARCHAR) – Matches `order_event_log.resource`  
- `role` (VARCHAR) – The role of the resource (e.g., SalesRep, CreditOfficer, WarehouseClerk)  
- `department` (VARCHAR) – The department (e.g., Sales, Finance, Logistics)  

### Assumed “Normal” Process Flow

For each order (`case_id`), the intended, normal sequence of activities is:

1. Register Order (Sales)  
2. Perform Credit Check (Finance)  
3. Validate Stock (Warehouse)  
4. Confirm Shipment (Logistics)  
5. Ship Goods (Logistics)  
6. Issue Invoice (Finance)  
7. Receive Payment (Finance)

### Your Tasks

1. **Identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors**  
   - Analyze the sequences of activities per `case_id` in `order_event_log` compared to the assumed normal process flow.  
   - Find and describe patterns such as:  
     - Activities occurring in the “wrong” order (e.g., shipping before credit check).  
     - Missing activities (e.g., no credit check, no shipment confirmation, no invoice, etc.).  
     - Activities that appear multiple times when they normally should appear once.  
     - Suspicious timing (e.g., payment before invoice, shipment confirmation after shipping, long delays between steps).  
     - Activities performed by roles or departments that are unexpected (e.g., Sales doing Finance tasks).  

2. **Hypothesize root causes**  
   For each major anomaly type you identify, propose plausible explanations, such as:  
   - System configuration issues or integration timing problems.  
   - Policy violations or workarounds by staff.  
   - Training issues or misunderstandings of process rules.  
   - Data quality issues, logging delays, or backdated entries.  
   Make these hypotheses explicit and link them to concrete patterns you observe in the data.

3. **Propose concrete SQL queries to investigate your hypotheses**  
   - For each anomaly type or hypothesis, write one or more **PostgreSQL SQL queries** that could be run against the `order_event_log` table (and optionally joining `orders` and `resources`) to:  
     - Quantify how often the anomaly occurs.  
     - Identify which orders (`case_id`) and which resources are involved.  
     - Segment by `order_type`, `order_value`, role, department, etc., where relevant.  
   - The queries should be syntactically valid PostgreSQL and runnable as-is, assuming:  
     - Table names: `order_event_log`, `orders`, `resources`.  
     - Column names exactly as specified above.  
   - Include queries for:  
     - Detecting reversed or skipped steps (e.g., `Ship Goods` before `Perform Credit Check` or `Validate Stock`).  
     - Detecting payment before invoice or before shipment.  
     - Detecting orders where mandatory steps (from the normal flow) are missing.  
     - Detecting role/department mismatches (e.g., shipment by non-Logistics, invoices by non-Finance).  
     - Optional: measuring time lags between steps (e.g., time from `Register Order` to `Ship Goods`, from `Issue Invoice` to `Receive Payment`), and flagging long outliers.  

4. **Present your answer in three parts**  
   - **(A) Anomaly types and concrete examples**  
     - Describe each anomaly type and give concrete example patterns (you may reference the illustrative `case_id`s like 1002, 1003, 1004 as examples).  
   - **(B) Hypotheses / possible root causes**  
     - For each anomaly type, list possible reasons why it might occur.  
   - **(C) SQL queries for investigation**  
     - Group the SQL queries by anomaly/hypothesis.  
     - For each query, briefly state what it is intended to reveal.  

Focus on:  
- Being systematic in the anomaly detection logic.  
- Making your SQL queries as general as possible (not hard-coded to specific `case_id`s).  
- Explicitly tying your queries back to the anomalies and hypotheses you describe.
