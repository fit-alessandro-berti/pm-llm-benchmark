## Step 1: Analyze POWL Model 1
In POWL Model 1, the activities are structured in a straightforward sequence:
1. Post a job advertisement.
2. Screen candidates.
3. Make a hiring decision.
4. Conduct interviews.
5. Onboard the employee.
6. Add the employee to payroll.
7. Close the case.

However, there's an anomaly in the sequence: interviewing candidates happens after the hiring decision has been made. Typically, interviews should occur before deciding on a candidate.

## Step 2: Analyze POWL Model 2
In POWL Model 2, the sequence is:
1. Post a job advertisement.
2. There's an option to either conduct interviews or skip them.
3. Regardless of whether interviews were conducted or not, make a hiring decision.
4. There's an optional loop for onboarding depending on whether a decision was made to hire. If not, a silent transition is performed.
5. A choice for adding the employee to payroll: a silent transition (not adding the employee) or actually adding the employee to payroll.
6. Close the case.

This model includes several anomalies:
- Interviews are optional, but the hiring decision is not contingent on whether interviews were conducted.
- Onboarding and adding the employee to payroll are optional and not necessarily in the correct sequence, considering typical process logic.
- The use of silent transitions introduces potential ambiguity in the workflow, as they do not perform any actual activity but can affect the flow.

## Step 3: Decide Which Model Aligns Better
Between the two models, Model 1 presents a clearer anomaly in process logic, where interviews occur after the hiring decision, disrupting the standard sequence of verifying a candidate's qualifications before committing to them.

Model 2, while including several options and loops that deviate from the expected sequence, for the sake of its complexity, offers a more adaptive handling of the hiring process. However, its anomalies compromise the integrity of the workflow by introducing potential loops and optional outcomes without clear dependencies.

Considering typical process logic and the standard sequence of activities in a Hire-to-Retire process, Model 2, despite its deviations, aligns closer to a normative version because it acknowledges and attempts to adaptively handle various outcomes, even though these are introduced through anomalies. Model 1 directly disrupts the logics of the process, making it less acceptable in a hiring context where the integrity of decision-making and candidate evaluation is crucial.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$
