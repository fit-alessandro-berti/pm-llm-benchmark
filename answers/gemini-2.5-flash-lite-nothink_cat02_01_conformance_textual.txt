Let's analyze the provided event log against the normative process description.

**Cases that Deviate from the Normative Process:**

*   **Case 2**
*   **Case 3**

**Explanation of Violations:**

**Case 2:**

*   **Violation:** The sequence of activities is `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Package items` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`.
*   **Rule Violated:** The normative description states, **"Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging.** In Case 2, "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment". This violates the stated dependency where payment authorization should inform or at least precede the physical preparation of items for shipment. The process flow implies that you need to know if payment is approved before you start packaging, especially if the payment could potentially be denied.

**Case 3:**

*   **Violation:** The sequence of activities is `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Cancel order` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`.
*   **Rule Violated:** The normative description clearly states, **"Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.** In Case 3, after "Cancel order" is executed, the process proceeds to "Ship order". This is a direct contradiction to the rule that shipping should not happen after an order has been canceled, as cancellation implies the fulfillment process should be halted. The normative description for cancellation scenarios indicates that after cancellation, the next reasonable step is to "Close order," not to proceed with fulfillment activities like shipping.

**Cases that Conform to the Normative Process:**

*   **Case 1:** `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Package items` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`. This follows the "sufficient inventory" path perfectly.
*   **Case 4:** `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Cancel order` -> `Close order`. This follows the "insufficient inventory" path perfectly.
*   **Case 5:** `Receive order` -> `Check inventory` -> `Authorize payment` -> `Ship order` -> `Close order`. This case is interesting because "Package items" is missing. However, the normative description doesn't strictly mandate that "Package items" *must* occur if shipping happens directly after authorization. It states, "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"
    *   **Interpretation of Ambiguity:** The phrasing "items should be prepared" and "it is appropriate to proceed" can be interpreted in a few ways.
        *   **Strict Interpretation:** If packaging *must* happen and be recorded as an activity before shipping, then Case 5 is also a deviation.
        *   **Looser Interpretation (adopted here):** The normative description focuses on the *dependencies* and *order* of key decision points. It outlines the *ideal* flow. The absence of a recorded "Package items" activity between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" *could* imply that packaging happened implicitly or was a very brief step not logged. More importantly, the *critical dependencies* are met: payment is authorized before shipping, and shipping doesn't happen after cancellation. Given that the process flow explicitly lists "Package items" as an intermediate step, a more robust normative model might require it. However, without a specific rule stating "Package items is mandatory before Ship order", and given the other rules are met, we will consider Case 5 as *not definitively violating* the core, critical normative rules *as explicitly stated*. If the intention was that packaging is always an explicit, logged step, then it would be a violation. But based on the provided text, the primary violation would be the order of operations or performing fulfillment after cancellation.

In summary, Case 2 violates the dependency between authorizing payment and packaging, while Case 3 violates the rule against shipping after cancellation.
