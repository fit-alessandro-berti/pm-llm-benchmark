In the table below I have grouped the 15 sensor snapshots into coherent “phases”, assigned an activity label to every phase, and written the reasoning that links the numeric pattern to the real-world manufacturing step.

| Phase | Event # (time span) | Assigned Activity | Characteristic sensor pattern | Why this pattern suggests the activity |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0 | 1-3 (08:00:00-08:00:10) <br> 13-15 (08:01:00-08:01:10) | Stand-by / Material Loading & Unloading | • Very low temperature (20-21 °C) <br> • Baseline pressure (1 bar) <br> • Vibration  0 Hz <br> • No material flow, tool at “home” (0 mm) <br> • Minimum energy ( 0.4-0.5 kWh) | Readings match a machine that is running but not cutting, welding, or moving tools. The same pattern appears at the start (before work) and the end (after work), so both windows are grouped as “idle / load-unload”. |
| 1 | 4-6 (08:00:15-08:00:25) | Cutting Metal | • Temperature rises rapidly (50  58 °C) <br> • Vibration jumps to 30-38 Hz <br> • Material flow 5 units/s (removal of chips/coolant) <br> • Tool moves from 5  10 mm <br> • Energy climbs to 3 kWh | Cutting generates heat and high-frequency vibration; chip conveyor or coolant pump causes measurable material flow; tool position is advancing into the workpiece; power draw is several times the idle value. |
| 2 | 7-8 (08:00:30-08:00:35) | Assembling / Component Positioning | • Temperature drops to 40 °C and stabilises <br> • Pressure increases to 2 bar (pneumatic clamps) <br> • Vibration drops to 10 Hz (mechanical movements, not cutting) <br> • Material flow lowers to 2 units/s (fasteners or small parts fed) <br> • Tool jumps to 15 mm, then holds | After cutting, the machine appears to move parts into place, clamp them, or add fasteners. Lower vibration and moderate pressure with modest flow are typical of pneumatic/servo assembly operations. |
| 3 | 9 (08:00:40) | Welding | • Sharp spike in temperature to 80 °C <br> • Highest vibration (50 Hz – arc ignition & wire feed motors) <br> • Zero material flow (no coolant/chips) <br> • Energy peak at 5 kWh | Electric welding briefly draws very high current (energy peak) and heat. No material flow because nothing is being removed; vibration is high due to arc stabilisation and wire drive. |
| 4 | 10-12 (08:00:45-08:00:55) | Quality Inspection / Cooling | • Temperature falls to 30  25 °C (cool-down) <br> • Pressure back to 1 bar <br> • Very low vibration (1-5 Hz) <br> • Little or no flow (0-1 units/s – air blow-off) <br> • Tool position settles at 15-20 mm <br> • Energy modest ( 1.0-1.6 kWh) | After welding the part cools while sensors or a vision system check dimensions. Low mechanical activity, low power, and slight airflow (1 unit/s) are common during inspection or purge. |

Resulting high-level process sequence (one complete cycle):
Stand-by  Cutting Metal  Assembling Parts  Welding  Inspection/Cooling  Stand-by.

These labels convert the unlabeled numeric log into a readable manufacturing process model that can now be used for further process-mining or performance-analysis work.
