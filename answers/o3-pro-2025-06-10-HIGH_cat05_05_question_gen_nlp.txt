1. How does the company balance cost efficiency with supply-chain resilience when relying on geographically dispersed, single-source suppliers for critical components?  
2. What contingency plans exist for geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, or natural disasters that could disrupt suppliers in Taiwan, South Korea, or Japan, and how frequently are these plans stress-tested?  
3. In what ways could closer collaboration between R&D and supply-chain planners reduce the time from concept approval to mass production without sacrificing quality or compliance?  
4. How might digital-twin simulations help identify hidden bottlenecks or inefficiencies across procurement, manufacturing, and logistics flows?  
5. Which stages of the assembly process in Malaysia present the greatest throughput constraints, and what improvements—automation, workforce upskilling, line balancing—would yield the highest ROI?  
6. How does the firm ensure consistent quality and traceability when suppliers follow different standards, and what mechanisms exist for rapid escalation if defects are detected post-shipment?  
7. What opportunities are there to incorporate circular-economy practices (e.g., component reuse, responsible recycling) to lower environmental impact and material costs?  
8. How should the company redefine its just-in-time strategy in light of recent global shipping disruptions, and what inventory buffers are optimal for high- versus low-volatility markets?  
9. What early-warning indicators best signal an impending shortage of key components, and how can supplier relationships be structured to secure preferential allocation during industry-wide crunches?  
10. How can machine-learning demand forecasts be improved for emerging markets with limited historical data and rapidly changing consumer behavior?  
11. What ethical and operational challenges arise from running 24/7 assembly lines, and how can worker wellbeing, safety, and retention be enhanced?  
12. How does the company verify compliance with diverse environmental regulations during multi-modal transport, and where are the biggest gaps in documentation or enforcement?  
13. Which innovative packaging or shipping solutions could significantly cut carbon emissions while maintaining product protection and brand experience?  
14. What would be the cost, lead-time, and complexity implications of adding regional assembly plants closer to end markets versus expanding the Malaysian facility?  
15. How could blockchain or other distributed-ledger technologies improve component traceability, anti-counterfeit measures, and supplier accountability?  
16. In what ways is warranty and after-sales service data fed back into supplier scorecards and future sourcing decisions?  
17. Which key performance indicators (KPIs) most effectively drive continuous improvement across sourcing, production, logistics, and after-sales functions?  
18. How resilient is the supply chain's digital infrastructure to cybersecurity threats targeting purchase orders, customs filings, and real-time tracking systems?  
19. What financial hedging strategies best mitigate currency-exchange volatility across procurement, production, and sales revenues denominated in multiple currencies?  
20. How can sustainability metrics be fully integrated into supplier contracts and incentive structures to encourage lower-carbon, socially responsible manufacturing practices?
