`-> ( 'RA', 'VF', 'AE', * ( tau, -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ), 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )`

- Main sequence: Receive Application  Validate Form  Assess Eligibility  Approval Decision  Send Confirmation  Archive Case  
- Loop in the middle: after Assess Eligibility you may repeat zero or more times the cycle “Request Missing Info  Validate Form”; the `tau` in the loop allows exiting immediately (i.e., skipping the loop entirely).
