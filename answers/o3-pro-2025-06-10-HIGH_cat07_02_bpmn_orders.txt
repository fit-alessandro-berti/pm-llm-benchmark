The picture is a Business-Process-Model-and-Notation (BPMN) diagram that shows, end-to-end, how a customer order moves through four organisational units:

1. Sales  
2. Production  
3. Procurement  
4. Warehouse  

General structure  
• Each horizontal band is a swim-lane that belongs to one unit.  
• Solid arrows are ordinary (“sequence”) flows inside a lane.  
• Dashed arrows are message flows that jump from one lane to another.  
• Circles = start / end events; envelopes in the circle = message start / end events.  
• Diamonds = gateways (decisions or forks).  
• Boxes = tasks; the thick-bordered box is an expanded sub-process.  
• The cylinder icon is a data store (customer database).

Step-by-step narrative

Sales lane  
1. Start event: “Monday morning”.  
2. Task: “Check order for completeness”.  
3. Exclusive gateway: “Is the customer already in the database?”  
   • If NO  task “Add customer to the database”, then re-join.  
4. Task: “Send order details” (message is thrown to Production & Procurement).  
5. The lane waits for a warehouse message (“Product sent”), then  
6. Task: “Draft invoice”, followed by a plain end event.

Production lane  
1. Message start: “Order details arrive”.  
2. Task: “Plan production”.  
3. Parallel gateway splits: one branch waits for the procurement message “Material not faulty”, the other leads directly to the join.  
4. Once material is confirmed, task “Manufacture product”.  
5. Message end event: “Product complete” (goes to the Warehouse).

Procurement lane  
1. Message start: “Order details arrive”.  
2. Expanded sub-process “Material Compensation”:  
   • Task “Order materials”.  
   • If goods are wrong/faulty, task “Return material” (dotted flow indicates exception).  
3. Outside the sub-process, task “Check materials”.  
4. If materials pass inspection, a message with the intermediate event “Material not faulty” is sent to Production.  
5. If inspection fails, an intermediate event triggers “Order cancellation”, which ends the procurement branch.

Warehouse lane  
1. Message start: receives “Product complete”.  
2. Task: “Send product”.  
3. Message end event: “Product sent” goes back to Sales.

What the diagram conveys  
• Sales is the process initiator.  
• Production cannot build anything until Procurement supplies material and signals that it is acceptable.  
• The Warehouse ships only after Production finishes.  
• When the customer’s goods leave the warehouse, Sales is informed so it can raise an invoice.  
• A material-quality failure in Procurement can short-circuit the flow (order cancelled).

In short, the visualization depicts an integrated order-to-cash workflow, highlighting the hand-offs, checks, and possible cancellation points among Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.
