Below is the most plausible reconstruction of the three separate patientjourneys (“cases”).  
The grouping is based on the constant patient descriptors (age + gender + insurance), the clinical logic of an emergency vs. elective surgery path, and the time-ordering of the events.


CASE #1ER, male, 45 yrs, private insurance  

 1. 08:05:13  Register patient  (ER – Admin Clerk)  
 4. 08:10:50  Initial triage    (ER – Nurse Joy)  
 7. 08:15:42  X-ray imaging     (Radiology – Radiology Tech)  
12. 08:23:10  Doctor consultation, Dx=hairline_fracture (ER – Dr. Lee)  
15. 08:30:05  Patient discharged, follow-up=outpatient_clinic (ER – Ward Clerk)  


CASE #2ER, female, 62 yrs, public insurance  

 2. 08:07:02  Register patient  (ER – Admin Clerk)  
 5. 08:12:29  Initial triage    (ER – Nurse Mark)  
 8. 08:16:10  Lab test requested  (ER – Dr. Smith)  
10. 08:20:27  Lab test completed  (Laboratory – Lab Tech)  
11. 08:22:54  Doctor consultation, Dx=minor_infection (ER – Dr. Smith)  
14. 08:27:00  Prescription created, meds=antibiotics (ER – Dr. Smith)  
17. 08:35:29  Patient discharged, follow-up=pharmacy_pickup (ER – Ward Clerk)  


CASE #3Elective knee surgery, male, 28 yrs, private insurance  

 3. 08:07:15  Register patient  (Surgery – Admin Clerk)  
 6. 08:13:00  Doctor consultation, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery (Surgery – Dr. Lee)  
 9. 08:16:45  Surgery preparation, GA planned (Surgery – Surgical Nurse)  
13. 08:25:19  Surgery performed, procedure=arthroscopy (Surgery – Dr. Lee)  
16. 08:31:37  Recovery room, condition=stable (Surgery – Recovery Nurse)  
18. 08:40:13  Patient discharged, follow-up=physiotherapy_sessions (Surgery – Ward Clerk)  

Key reasoning cues
• Age + gender combinations are unique across the log (45 M, 62 F, 28 M), making them natural surrogate case identifiers.  
• Departmental paths differ: two ER presentations vs. one Surgery pathway.  
• Activities obey clinical order for each path (e.g., registration  triage  imaging  consultation  discharge for the fracture patient).  
• Time stamps are strictly increasing inside each reconstructed case.

Thus the 18 interleaved events map to exactly three cases as detailed above.
