**Explanation:**

The logic applied for transforming the raw system log into a process mining event log follows these steps:

1. **Case Identification:**
   - Each user session was treated as a separate case. A new case starts with the first significant activity (usually focusing on a document) and ends when the user closes all applications related to that task.
   - To group events, I considered both explicit user actions like saving or closing documents, as well as inferred transitions such as after typing content, which often precedes a save or send action.

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - High-level activities were constructed by combining the system's low-level actions with context, particularly application and window titles. For instance, "FOCUS" on a document was named "Start Editing Docx" to convey meaningful process steps.
   - I aimed to use consistent activity names that would be familiar to analysts examining business processes.

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - Each event includes the unique Case ID for tracing the logical unit of work through its activities.
   - The Activity Name reflects higher-level process steps as explained.
   - The Timestamp preserves the original event time.
   - Additional attributes such as "Application" and "Window Title" were not included in the final log but would be useful for analysis with more advanced tools that can leverage this data.

4. **Coherent Narrative:**
   - This log tells the story of a user working on a report, handling emails related to an annual meeting, editing budget information, and then drafting the executive summary of the report. The narrative follows a logical sequence of business activities, segmented into distinct cases by application focus and completion of tasks.

The final event log is designed to be analyzable by process mining tools, with activities that correspond to identifiable process stages and transitions that indicate the flow of user work sessions. The naming convention strives for coherence, aiding analysts in interpreting the data as meaningful steps in a business process.
