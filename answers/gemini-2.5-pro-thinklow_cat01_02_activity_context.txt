Of course. Here is a detailed analysis, the revised event log, and the justification for the changes based on the provided prompt.

### 1. Analysis of Ambiguous Activities

By analyzing the event log, two main activities were identified as having different contextual meanings despite sharing the same name: **`Verify Documents`** and **`Call Customer`**.

*   **Verify Documents:** This activity appears twice in cases C001 and C003.
    *   **First Occurrence:** In all cases, the initial `Verify Documents` activity happens immediately after the request is initiated. It represents the standard, initial check of the customer's provided information.
    *   **Second Occurrence:** In cases C001 and C003, this activity happens *after* a corrective action has been taken (e.g., the customer submitted additional documents or an agent adjusted the account). This second instance is a *re-verification* to confirm that the issue is now resolved and the documents are complete and correct.

*   **Call Customer:** This activity appears multiple times within case C002 and has a distinctly different purpose in each of the three cases.
    *   **In Case C001:** The call is made to explicitly **request missing information** from the customer after the initial verification failed.
    *   **In Case C002:** The first call is to **clarify a discrepancy** found in the account details. The second call is a follow-up to **confirm** that the internal adjustments have been made correctly. These are two separate and distinct interactions.
    *   **In Case C003:** The call is purely logistical, made to **request the customer's return** to the branch after they had stepped out.

Additionally, the **`Initiate Request`** activity, while not recurring within a single case, has a different origin depending on the case (Web vs. Branch), which can be clarified for better process understanding.

### 2. Justification for Renaming

The new names were chosen to disambiguate these activities by embedding their specific purpose or sequence into the name itself.

| Original Name      | Context                                                              | New Name                                | Justification                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Initiate Request` | Submitted via online portal.                                         | `Initiate Request via Portal`           | Clarifies the channel of initiation, distinguishing it from in-person requests.                               |
| `Initiate Request` | Submitted by a walk-in customer.                                     | `Initiate Request at Branch`            | Immediately signals a different process variant starting at a physical location.                              |
| `Verify Documents` | The first check performed after initiation.                          | `Initial Document Verification`         | The "Initial" prefix clearly marks this as the first, standard verification step in the workflow.               |
| `Verify Documents` | The check performed after a correction or addition of information.   | `Re-verify Corrected Documents`         | The "Re-verify" prefix indicates repetition, and "Corrected" adds the context that a change has occurred.       |
| `Call Customer`    | To ask for missing documents (C001).                                 | `Call Customer for Missing Info`        | The name specifies the *reason* for the call, linking it directly to the failed verification.                 |
| `Call Customer`    | To clarify an issue (C002).                                          | `Call Customer for Clarification`       | Distinguishes this investigative call from other types of customer interactions.                              |
| `Call Customer`    | To confirm a change has been made (C002).                            | `Call Customer to Confirm Adjustment`   | Marks this as a concluding, informational call, separating it from the problem-solving call that preceded it. |
| `Call Customer`    | To ask a customer to come back to the branch (C003).                 | `Call Customer to Return to Branch`     | Highlights the logistical and location-specific nature of this call, which is unique to the branch process.   |
