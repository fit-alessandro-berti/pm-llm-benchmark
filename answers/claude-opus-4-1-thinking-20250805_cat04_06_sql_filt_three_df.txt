Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Find cases with the exact sequence in direct succession
2. Check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is > 5 days
3. Exclude those cases from the final result

Here's my DuckDB SQL solution:

```sql
WITH sequence_detection AS (
    -- For each event, look ahead to the next two events in the same case
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp_1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp_2
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    -- Identify cases that have the specific sequence with the timing condition
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence_detection
    WHERE 
        -- Check for the exact sequence starting from current row
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 
        AND next_activity_1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_activity_2 = 'Confirm Order'
        -- Check if time between Create Order and Confirm Order > 5 days
        AND (next_timestamp_2 - next_timestamp_1) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
-- Return all events except those from excluded cases
SELECT * 
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **sequence_detection CTE**: Uses the `LEAD` window function to look at the next two activities and their timestamps for each event within a case. This ensures we're checking for direct succession.

2. **cases_to_exclude CTE**: Identifies cases where:
   - The current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   - The immediately next activity is 'Create Order' 
   - The activity after that is 'Confirm Order'
   - The time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days

3. **Final SELECT**: Returns all events from the original table, excluding those that belong to the identified cases.

The query ensures that:
- The three activities appear in exact order with no intervening events (via LEAD function)
- The timing condition is checked only for the qualifying sequences
- All events from non-matching cases are preserved in the output
