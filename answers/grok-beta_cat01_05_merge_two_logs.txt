### Step-by-Step Approach to Merging Event Logs

**1. Data Preparation:**
   - Convert all timestamps to a uniform format for comparison (e.g., `datetime` objects in Python).
   - Normalize event names to facilitate matching.

**2. Event Matching:**
   - Use `order_id` as the primary key for matching events.
   - Look for temporal proximity within a tolerance of 2 seconds.
   - Normalize event names to account for slight variations (e.g., `Order Received` vs `OrderReceived`).

**3. Event Merging:**
   - If events match, merge attributes from both logs into a new record.
   - Choose the timestamp from Log A as the primary timestamp since it's the primary timeline, but include both timestamps if they differ.
   - Document decisions regarding conflicts or unmatched events.

**4. Handling Non-Matching Events:**
   - Events with no match in the other log will be kept as separate records with a notation indicating their source.

**5. Output Formatting:**
   - Create a merged log where each event record includes all possible attributes from both logs.
   - Order events chronologically using the primary timestamp.

### Merged Log Creation:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Normalize and convert timestamps
def normalize_timestamp(ts):
    return datetime.strptime(ts, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

# Normalize event names
def normalize_event(event):
    return event.lower().replace(" ", "")

# Log A
log_a = [
    ("2023-10-10T10:00:00Z", "Order Received", "Order#1234"),
    ("2023-10-10T10:01:30Z", "Order Validated", "Order#1234"),
    ("2023-10-10T10:02:00Z", "Payment Processed", "Order#1234"),
    ("2023-10-10T10:05:00Z", "Item Shipped", "Order#1234"),
    ("2023-10-10T10:20:00Z", "Item Delivered", "Order#1234")
]

# Log B
log_b = [
    ("2023-10-10T09:59:58Z", "OrderReceived", "Order#1234", "u45", "r10", "Event captured at warehouse system"),
    ("2023-10-10T10:01:29Z", "OrderValidation", "Order#1234", "u12", "r10", "Cross-check inventory"),
    ("2023-10-10T10:02:05Z", "PaymentCheck", "Order#1234", "u12", "r99", "Payment gateway delay"),
    ("2023-10-10T10:03:00Z", "Quality Check", "Order#1234", "u45", "r11", "Random inspection"),
    ("2023-10-10T10:05:02Z", "Shipping", "Order#1234", "u45", "r10", "Package handed to courier")
]

# Convert to datetime
log_a = [(normalize_timestamp(ts), event, order_id) for ts, event, order_id in log_a]
log_b = [(normalize_timestamp(ts), event, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes) for ts, event, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes in log_b]

# Match and merge events
merged_events = []
tolerance = timedelta(seconds=2)

for a_event in log_a:
    a_ts, a_event_type, a_order_id = a_event
    matched = False
    for b_event in log_b:
        b_ts, b_event_type, b_order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes = b_event
        if a_order_id == b_order_id and abs(a_ts - b_ts) <= tolerance and normalize_event(a_event_type) == normalize_event(b_event_type):
            merged_events.append({
                'timestamp': a_ts.isoformat() + 'Z',  # Use Log A's timestamp as primary
                'event_type': a_event_type,
                'order_id': a_order_id,
                'user_id': user_id,
                'resource_id': resource_id,
                'notes': notes,
                'source': 'Merged from A and B',
                'alternate_timestamp': b_ts.isoformat() + 'Z' if a_ts != b_ts else None
            })
            matched = True
            log_b.remove(b_event)  # Remove matched event from B
            break
    if not matched:
        merged_events.append({
            'timestamp': a_ts.isoformat() + 'Z',
            'event_type': a_event_type,
            'order_id': a_order_id,
            'source': 'Log A',
        })

# Add remaining events from Log B
for b_event in log_b:
    b_ts, b_event_type, b_order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes = b_event
    merged_events.append({
        'timestamp': b_ts.isoformat() + 'Z',
        'event_type': b_event_type,
        'order_id': b_order_id,
        'user_id': user_id,
        'resource_id': resource_id,
        'notes': notes,
        'source': 'Log B',
    })

# Sort merged events by timestamp
merged_events.sort(key=lambda x: x['timestamp'])

# Print merged log
for event in merged_events:
    print(f"{event['timestamp']}, {event['event_type']}, {event['order_id']}, {event.get('user_id', 'N/A')}, {event.get('resource_id', 'N/A')}, {event.get('notes', 'N/A')}, {event['source']}, {event.get('alternate_timestamp', 'N/A')}")
```

### Reasoning:

- **Timestamp Selection:** Log A's timestamp is used as the primary since it represents when events were received, which is often more relevant for process analysis.
- **Event Matching:** Events are matched based on order_id, temporal proximity, and normalized event names. This accounts for small timestamp discrepancies and naming variations.
- **Unmatched Events:** Events from Log B that did not match any in Log A are included as-is, indicating they are from Log B, to ensure no data is lost.
- **Attribute Integration:** All attributes from both logs are included when possible, providing a richer dataset for analysis.
- **Chronological Order:** The final log is sorted by the primary timestamp to ensure events are listed in the order they occurred.

This approach ensures a comprehensive and coherent merged event log that leverages the strengths of both systems while maintaining data integrity.
