To identify unfair differences in the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we can analyze the process variants and their frequencies and execution times. Here are the main differences observed:

### 1. **Frequency of Rejection/Denial:**
   - **Protected Group:** 
     - There are multiple process variants leading to "Application Rejected" or "Loan Denied," with a total frequency of 960 + 229 + 227 + 217 + 138 + 104 + 88 + 84 + 40 + 37 + 33 + 26 + 26 + 17 + 15 + 13 = **2,634**.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The total frequency of "Application Rejected" or "Loan Denied" is 2709 + 335 + 297 + 80 + 58 + 7 + 1 + 1 = **3,468**.
   - **Observation:** 
     - The unprotected group has a higher total frequency of rejections/denials compared to the protected group. However, this needs to be considered in the context of the total number of process variants and the overall frequency distribution.

### 2. **Process Complexity and Steps:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The protected group has more complex process variants with additional steps, such as multiple "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" steps and "Request Co-Signer On Loan."
     - Example: 
       - "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (frequency = 15, performance = 390019.000)
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The unprotected group has simpler process variants with fewer steps leading to "Loan Denied" or "Sign Loan Agreement."
     - Example:
       - "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (frequency = 2709, performance = 340005.309)
   - **Observation:**
     - The protected group undergoes more complex and time-consuming processes, which may indicate additional scrutiny or barriers in the loan application process.

### 3. **Execution Time (Performance):**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The execution times for the protected group are generally longer, with some process variants taking up to 390,000 units of time.
     - Example:
       - "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (frequency = 15, performance = 390019.000)
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The execution times for the unprotected group are generally shorter, with most process variants taking around 340,000 units of time.
     - Example:
       - "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" (frequency = 2709, performance = 340005.309)
   - **Observation:**
     - The protected group's processes take significantly longer to execute, which could indicate delays or additional steps that are not present in the unprotected group's processes.

### 4. **Approval Paths:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The protected group has fewer process variants leading to "Sign Loan Agreement," and these variants often involve additional steps and longer execution times.
     - Example:
       - "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" (frequency = 13, performance = 349945.923)
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The unprotected group has more straightforward paths to "Sign Loan Agreement" with fewer steps and shorter execution times.
     - Example:
       - "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" (frequency = 1656, performance = 340004.889)
   - **Observation:**
     - The unprotected group has more efficient and direct paths to loan approval, while the protected group faces more complex and time-consuming paths to the same outcome.

### 5. **Skipped Steps:**
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The unprotected group has process variants where certain steps are skipped, such as "skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement" (frequency = 332, performance = 260013.446).
   - **Protected Group:**
     - There are no process variants in the protected group where steps are skipped.
   - **Observation:**
     - The unprotected group benefits from skipped steps, which may indicate a more lenient or streamlined process for this group.

### **Conclusion:**
The protected group appears to be subject to more complex, time-consuming, and scrutinized processes compared to the unprotected group. The protected group faces more steps, longer execution times, and fewer direct paths to loan approval. Additionally, the unprotected group benefits from skipped steps and more straightforward processes, which may contribute to faster approval or denial outcomes.

These differences could indicate potential unfair treatment of the protected group, as they are subjected to more stringent and time-consuming processes, which may disproportionately affect their loan application outcomes.
