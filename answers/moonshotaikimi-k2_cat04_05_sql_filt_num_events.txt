Here’s a concise idiomatic DuckDB query that meets the requirement:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

How it works  
1. The subquery groups every `case_id` and keeps those whose **COUNT(*)** is 6 events or fewer.  
2. The outer query then returns **every row** (full events) whose `case_id` survived that filter.
