### Process Mining Event Log Transformation

To transform the provided Windows system log into a process mining event log, we need to group related events into coherent cases and map raw actions to meaningful activities. Below is the transformed event log:

| Case ID | Activity Name          | Timestamp            | Application       | Window Title                         |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|

### Explanation

**Case Identification:**

- **Start Typing/Type X**: These activities are used for different phases of typing, starting and continuing with text input.
- **Highlight Text**: This activity is named after the action taken in the PDF reader to highlight a specific section.
- **Save Work**: Represents saving work within an application.
- **Switch to Application**: Indicates switching focus from one application to another.
- **Scroll Down/Up**: These activities capture vertical movement within a document or interface.
- **Reply to Email**: Describes the action of replying to an email in the browser.

**Event Attributes:**
- **Case ID**: A unique identifier for each case, which is determined by the initial application and file opened (e.g., Document1.docx).
- **Activity Name**: Standardized names that reflect meaningful actions within a process.
- **Timestamp**: The original event timestamp.
- **Application/Window Title**: Details of the application and window title to provide context.

This transformation helps in creating a coherent narrative of user work sessions, making it easier for analysts to understand and analyze the workflow.
