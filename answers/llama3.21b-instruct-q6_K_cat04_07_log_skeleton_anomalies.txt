Based on the provided activity occurrences, I have identified some potential anomalies in the proposed process model:

1. **Lack of Revisions:** After the declaration is approved by the administraion but not by the PRE_APPROVER, it was either rejected or saved. It should be that it gets reviewed again.
2. **Multiple Rejections of Declaration:** While there are instances where a declaration is reJECTED by BUDGET OWNER as well as by MISSING, this could be due to different reasons such as budget issue vs being in non-active status, however the overall process seems flawed, and only one approval can be given for each declaration.

Upon further examination, it appears that there may not be enough validation of the decisions at every stage.
