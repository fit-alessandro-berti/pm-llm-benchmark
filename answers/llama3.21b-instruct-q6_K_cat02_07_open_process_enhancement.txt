In process mining, a comprehensive approach to understanding business processes is employed. The different components involved are:

1. **Process Discovery (PD):**

Discovery is the initial stage where the current state of our process in terms of its elements (inputs, activities, outputs) is mapped and documented. This involves gathering information, conducting investigations into the workflow of the organization during various cycles to identify, document each phase or section based on existing standards.

Process discovery aims at understanding as much about the current execution of a business process without altering it. The focus here primarily focuses on improving efficiency by reducing unnecessary steps, streamlining workflows and enabling data collection for further analysis.

2. **Conformance Checking (CC):**

Conformance checking is about identifying deviations from agreed-upon business processes and validating the compliance to such standards. This involves conducting reviews of the current process against a structured model or set of guidelines. While it addresses a specific aspect of process effectiveness, conformance checking focuses more on enforcement mechanisms. Conformity checks ensure that an organization adheres strictly to its own policies and procedures.

3. **Process Enhancement (PE):**

Process enhancement is about optimizing business processes to make them more effective in achieving results. Unlike discovery, which aims at identifying the current states of a process or its elements without changing it, enhancing involves modifying an existing process to reflect better practices aligned with organizational goals. This enhancement includes improving operational efficiency, reducing costs by reducing cycle times and waste, streamlining management structures, and minimizing non-value-added activities.

Process enhancements target significant changes towards creating more impactful, strategic value for the organization due to a focused approach on refining processes for higher productivity, cost savings, customer satisfaction, or improved decision-making capabilities.

In summary:

- **Discovery** focuses on understanding an organization's current state of its processes.
- **Conformance Checking** verifies adherence to set standards and processes.
- **Process Enhancement** seeks to create more efficient, effective, and high-value business processes.
