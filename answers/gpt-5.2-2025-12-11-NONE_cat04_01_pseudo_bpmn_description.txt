### 1) Overall intent of the process
The process models how an organization handles an incoming customer request (e.g., an order/request for quotation), routes it based on whether it’s a **standard** or **custom** request, performs the appropriate checks/analysis, and then (optionally) seeks managerial approval before issuing an invoice and confirming to the customer. It also includes a **rework loop** when approval is denied.

---

### 2) Step-by-step business meaning (tasks and flow)

#### Start Event  **Task A: “Receive Customer Request”**
- **Purpose:** Intake of the request into the process (capture requirements, customer details, requested items/configuration, quantities, dates, etc.).
- **Output:** A classified request ready for evaluation.

---

### 3) First decision: request type selection

#### **XOR Gateway: “Check Request Type”**
- **Meaning (XOR / exclusive choice):** Exactly **one** outgoing path is taken, based on the request’s type.
- **Business logic:** Determine whether the request matches predefined offerings (“standard”) or requires bespoke work (“custom”).

---

## 4) Standard request path

#### **Task B1: “Perform Standard Validation”**
- **Purpose:** Ensure the request aligns with standard catalog rules: valid product, pricing rules, serviceability, basic customer data completeness, etc.
- **Outcome:** A validated standard order/request.

#### **AND Gateway: “Run Parallel Checks”**
- **Meaning (AND / parallel split):** Launches multiple activities **at the same time** (logically parallel).
- **Why parallel:** Credit and inventory checks can be done independently to reduce cycle time.

##### **Task C1: “Credit Check”**
- **Purpose:** Verify customer creditworthiness/limits, outstanding balances, payment terms, risk flags.

##### **Task C2: “Inventory Check”**
- **Purpose:** Confirm availability of items/resources; or validate capacity/lead time if made-to-stock vs made-to-order.

#### **Parallel Join: “All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)”**
- **Meaning (AND join):** The process **waits until both** the credit and inventory checks are completed before continuing.
- **Rationale:** Delivery date calculation depends on inventory/capacity; proceeding without either check could be wrong.

#### **Task D: “Calculate Delivery Date”**
- **Purpose:** Determine feasible delivery/fulfillment date using inventory availability, lead times, logistics constraints, possibly credit hold outcomes.
- **Output:** A delivery promise that can be invoiced/confirmed.

---

## 5) Custom request path

#### **Task B2: “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”**
- **Purpose:** Engineering/operations review to decide if the custom request can be delivered: technical feasibility, cost, lead time, compliance, tooling, capacity, risks.

#### **XOR Gateway: “Is Customization Feasible?”**
- **Meaning (XOR):** Choose one of two outcomes—feasible or not feasible.

##### If **Yes**  **Task E1: “Prepare Custom Quotation”**
- **Purpose:** Build a bespoke quote: pricing based on BOM/effort, custom lead times, special terms, risk buffers, and scope definitions.

##### If **No**  **Task E2: “Send Rejection Notice”**  **End Event**
- **Purpose:** Notify customer the request cannot be fulfilled (possibly with reasons or alternatives).
- **This is a terminal path:** The process ends early because there’s nothing to approve/invoice.

---

### 6) Convergence after “Standard” or “Custom feasible” work
Your pseudo-model states:

> “After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed”

This is a **conceptual merge point**:  
- For **standard**, it occurs after **Task D** (delivery date is ready).  
- For **custom feasible**, it occurs after **Task E1** (custom quotation is ready).  

In BPMN terms, this is typically represented as an **XOR merge gateway** (or just converging sequence flows) because only one of the two branches will have been active.

---

### 7) Approval handling (optional)

#### **XOR Gateway: “Is Approval Needed?”**
- **Meaning:** Decide whether this case requires managerial approval.
- **Typical triggers:** High discount, large order value, low margin, credit risk, non-standard terms, long lead times, custom work risk, exceptions to policy.

##### If **No**  skip directly to invoicing
- Goes to **Task G: “Generate Final Invoice”**

##### If **Yes**  **Task F: “Obtain Manager Approval”**
- **Purpose:** Manager reviews the prepared standard outcome (delivery date/terms) or custom quotation and decides to approve or reject.

#### **XOR Gateway: “Is Approval Granted?”**
- **Meaning:** Route based on approval decision.

##### If **Yes**  **Task G: “Generate Final Invoice”**
- **Purpose:** Produce the final invoice (or final commercial document) based on approved terms.

##### If **No**  **Task H: “Re-evaluate Conditions”**
- **Purpose:** Rework step. The business revisits price/terms/scope/delivery assumptions to address the manager’s concerns (e.g., adjust discount, revise lead time, change payment terms, reduce customization scope).

---

### 8) Rework loop (where it loops back depends on request type)
After **Task H**, the model states:

> “Loop back to Task E1 (for Custom Path) or Task D (for Standard Path)”

- **Standard rework loop  back to Task D (Calculate Delivery Date):**  
  Implies approval denial is due to delivery/fulfillment conditions (or conditions tied to delivery feasibility). In practice, it might also involve revisiting credit/inventory or pricing, but your model loops specifically to delivery date calculation.

- **Custom rework loop  back to Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation):**  
  Implies approval denial is due to quote contents (price, margin, scope, risk assumptions). The team updates the quotation and then the case will again hit the approval decision/approval granted check (depending on how you model the loop’s reconnection).

**Key implication:** The process can iterate multiple times until approval is granted or the business chooses to terminate (your model does not explicitly show a “give up/cancel” path during rework, but it could be added).

---

### 9) Finalization

#### **Task I: “Send Confirmation to Customer”**
- **Purpose:** Send the outcome to the customer (confirmation of order/quote acceptance terms, invoice issued, delivery date, next steps).
- **Occurs after:** Invoice generation (Task G).

#### **End Event**
- **Purpose:** Process completes after confirmation is sent.

---

## 10) How standard vs custom differs (summary)
- **Standard requests** focus on:
  - Standard validation (B1)
  - **Parallel operational checks** (credit + inventory)
  - Delivery date calculation (D)
- **Custom requests** focus on:
  - Feasibility analysis (B2)
  - A feasibility decision (custom feasible?)
  - If feasible, creation of a custom quotation (E1)
  - If not feasible, rejection notice (E2) and end

Both (standard completed OR custom feasible quoted) then converge into the **approval decision** and then to **final invoice + customer confirmation**.

---

## 11) When approvals and rework are triggered
- **Approval is triggered** when the “Is Approval Needed?” gateway evaluates to Yes—typically due to policy thresholds or risk/exception conditions.
- **Rework is triggered** when approval is required and the manager **does not grant approval** at “Is Approval Granted?”.
- **Rework loops back** to:
  - **Task D** for standard cases (revise delivery/conditions)
  - **Task E1** for custom cases (revise quotation/terms)

If you want, I can redraw this as a more “BPMN-correct” structure (explicit merge gateways, explicit loop connectors, and clear reconnection points) and suggest where additional end states (e.g., “Customer cancels”, “Rework limit reached”) typically appear.
