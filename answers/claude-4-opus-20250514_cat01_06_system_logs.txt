## Explanation of Case Grouping and Activity Naming Logic

**Case Identification Logic:**
I grouped events into cases based on the document or task context. Each case represents a coherent unit of work:
- **DOC-001**: All activities related to working on Document1.docx
- **EMAIL-001**: The complete email handling workflow (reading and replying to the Annual Meeting email)
- **PDF-001**: The PDF review session for Report_Draft.pdf
- **BUDGET-001**: Budget spreadsheet editing activities
- **REPORT-001**: Work on the Quarterly Report document

**Activity Naming Strategy:**
I standardized the raw system actions into business-meaningful activities:
- FOCUS actions became "Open Document/Spreadsheet/PDF" when first accessing a file
- TYPING actions were translated to "Edit Document", "Compose Email", or "Update Data" depending on context
- CLICK actions were interpreted based on context (e.g., "Open Email", "Reply to Email", "Send Email")
- SCROLL actions became "Read Email" or "Review PDF"
- HIGHLIGHT action became "Annotate PDF"
- SAVE and CLOSE actions retained their meaning but were standardized

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. The initial FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx was excluded as it appeared to be a brief check before starting actual work
2. Document1.docx activities were kept as one case despite the interruption for other tasks, as the user returned to complete the document
3. Each document/application context forms its own case to maintain clarity in process flows
4. Activities are named to reflect business intent rather than technical actions

This transformation creates a process log that clearly shows four distinct work processes: document creation, email handling, PDF review, and budget updating, making it suitable for process mining analysis.
