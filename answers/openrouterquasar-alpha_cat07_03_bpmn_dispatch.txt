This visualization is a **business process flowchart** depicting the **shipment preparation** process in a computer hardware shop. It uses standard BPMN-like symbols to represent tasks, decisions, and process flow, and it is structured across three swimlanes representing different departments or roles:

### Swimlanes:
- **Dispatch of goods (Computer Hardware Shop Secretary)**
- **Logistics**
- **Warehouse**

### Process Description:

1. **Start:** The process begins with the task "Ship goods."
   
2. **Clarify shipment method:**
   - Order details are reviewed to clarify how the goods will be shipped.
   
3. **Decision - Special handling?**

   - If this takes longer than 48 hours, the customer is notified about the delay.
   
7. **Fill out shipment paperwork:**
   - Once the goods are packaged and labeling or insurance is complete, shipment paperwork is filled out.
   
8. **Move package to pickup area:**
   - The package is then moved to the pickup area for dispatch.

9. **End:**
