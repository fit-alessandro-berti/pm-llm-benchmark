Here’s a concise assessment of each model against a normative Hire-to-Retire process (roughly: Post job  Screen candidates  Conduct interviews  Make hiring decision  Onboard employee  Add to payroll  Close case):

Model 1 analysis
- Structure: Post  Screen; after Screen, both Decide and Interview are enabled; Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close. No explicit constraint between Interview and Decide besides both following Screen.
- Anomalies:
  1) Decision before/without interviews: Because Decide is enabled directly after Screen (in parallel with Interview), the hiring decision can be taken before interviews are conducted or even without conducting them. This violates core hiring logic.
  2) Interviews possibly redundant/late: Interviews can occur after the decision (since no edge from Interview to Decide), making them pointless or inconsistent.
  3) Missing optionality semantics: There is no explicit choice/loop to indicate rework (e.g., re-screening) or that interviews might be repeated or skipped by policy; instead, partial order allows freedom that can harm correctness.
- Severity: High, because it allows hiring decisions without interviews.

Model 2 analysis
- Structure: Post precedes Screen and Interview (both can start after Post). Interview  Decide. After Decide, a loop on Onboard (Onboard, skip) allows zero or multiple onboarding cycles. Then XOR(Payroll, skip) allows optional payroll. Close follows.
- Anomalies:
  1) Screening can be skipped or run in parallel with interviews: Post enables both Screen and Interview independently; there is no constraint Screen  Interview. This allows interviews without prior screening, and even never doing screening. This deviates from common practice but is less logically fatal than deciding without interviewing.
  2) Optional payroll: XOR(Payroll, skip) lets cases close without adding the employee to payroll, which contradicts the essence of Hire-to-Retire after a hire. Severe from an HR/payroll integrity standpoint.
  3) Potentially zero onboarding: The loop with a skip as the redo path also permits zero onboarding iterations. That allows hiring without onboarding, a notable deviation (though in edge cases, an internal transfer might require minimal onboarding).
  4) Over-flexible re-onboarding: Multiple onboarding iterations are allowed; unusual but conceivable (e.g., re-onboarding for corrections), though typically you would model rework more explicitly.
- Positive aspect compared to Model 1: Interview  Decide enforces that the hiring decision cannot precede interviews, preserving a key logical dependency.

Which model is closer to normative?
- Despite Model 2 allowing optional payroll and overly flexible onboarding/screening, it preserves the critical dependency that interviews precede the hiring decision. Model 1 permits the decision before or without interviews, which fundamentally undermines the hiring logic.
- Therefore, Model 2 aligns more closely with a normative Hire-to-Retire process, primarily because it enforces Interview  Decide. Its anomalies (optional payroll, optional/parallel screening, optional onboarding) are serious but can be tightened with additional constraints; the core hiring logic remains intact. In contrast, Model 1 breaks that core logic by allowing Decide without Interview, rendering outcomes untrustworthy.

Summary of anomaly severity
- Most severe in Model 1: Decision independent of interviews.
- Most severe in Model 2: Payroll optional after hiring; onboarding optional.
- Overall choice: Model 2 is closer to the normative process due to preserving the essential interview-before-decision dependency.
