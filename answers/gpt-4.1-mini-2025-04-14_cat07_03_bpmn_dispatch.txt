The provided visualization is a swimlane diagram illustrating the process for shipping goods in a Computer Hardware Shop. The swimlanes represent three roles/entities involved: Secretary, Warehouse, and Logistics.

Here is a detailed description of the flow:

**Start:**  
- The process starts with the event "Ship goods."

**Secretary Lane:**  
1. Clarify shipment method.  
2. Check if there is special handling needed:  
   - If **yes**:  
     - Get 3 offers from logistics companies.  
     - Select a logistics company and place the order.  
   - If **no**:  
     - Check if insurance is required (uses customer information).  
     - If insurance is required, insure the parcel.  
3. Write the package label (this happens always after checking insurance).  
4. Both the order placement (for special handling) and the package label writing converge.

**Warehouse Lane:**  
1. Package goods. This step has a timer event with a duration of 48 hours.  
2. If the packaging takes longer than 48 hours, the system notifies the customer about the delay.  
3. After packaging is complete, the flow synchronizes with the Secretary's flow.  
4. Fill out shipment paperwork.  
5. Move the package to the pickup area.

**Logistics Lane:**  
- This lane is involved only with the "Insure parcel" step, which is connected with the Secretary’s flow when insurance is necessary.

**End:**  
- The process ends with "Shipment prepared," indicating that the package is ready for shipment.

**Key points:**  
- The decision points handle special handling and insurance requirements.  
- The packaging step has time-based monitoring for delays.  
- Customer notifications occur for delays related to packaging.

This diagram effectively maps the tasks and decision points required to ship goods within the Computer Hardware Shop environment involving Secretary, Warehouse, and Logistics.
