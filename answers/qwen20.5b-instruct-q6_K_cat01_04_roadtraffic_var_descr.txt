Based on the data described in the document, here is a high-level overview of how it was created:

1. "Create Fine" -> "Payment"
   - This operation might involve sending out fines to individuals or entities for non-payment of a specific fine amount.

2. "Create Fine" -> "Send Fine"
   - It creates an invoice that contains the details of the fine, such as the person or entity involved, and the amount owed. The payment is made by a bank account or credit card.

3. "Create Fine" -> "Insert Fine Notification"
   - This operation involves creating a notification to the fines' recipient (i.e., a bank or government agency) that confirms receipt of the fine.

4. "Create Fine" -> "Add penalty"
   - This operation adds a penalty to the fine, which is generally used when there's more than one non-payment.

5. "Create Fine" -> "Payment"
   - The fines are then paid through the payment mechanism involved in this process (e.g., bank account, credit card).

6. "Create Fine" -> "Insert Fine Notification -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture"
   - This operation involves sending out notification requests for fines and appeals to relevant authorities or courts.

7. "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment ( frequency = 34  performance = 16001788.235)"
   - The fine is first paid in stages, with each payment being made on a separate payment date and amount.

8. "Create Fine" -> "Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender"
   - This process involves sending out appeals and receiving information about the outcome of fines that were paid through the various methods.

9. "Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture"
   - The fine details (details from the initial creation) are then added to a notification for payment, allowing them to be processed according to their specific circumstances.

10. "Create Fine -> Payment -> Pay Off"
    - The fines are usually settled after payment in terms of amounts or time period specified by the payer or court.

So overall, it involves several steps and interactions between different systems, each with its own rules and processes for handling and processing financial debts. The data seems to reflect this process within a specific jurisdiction, possibly as part of an administrative procedure or legal system.
