Certainly! Below is a detailed DuckDB SQL query that addresses the given benchmark task. The query will:

Determine the sequence of activities for each case_id, maintaining the order imposed by timestamp.
Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants.
Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants by their frequency.
Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants.
SQL Query

Explanation
ordered_activities CTE:

Assigns a sequence number to each activity within a case, ordered by the timestamp.
Ensures that only rows with non-NULL activity and timestamp are considered.
case_sequences CTE:

Aggregates the activities into an array for each case based on the sequence number.
This creates the activity sequence for each case_id.
sequence_frequencies CTE:

Counts the frequency of each unique activity sequence to determine how many cases follow each variant.
ranked_sequences CTE:

Ranks the variants based on their frequency in descending order using DENSE_RANK().
top_k_sequences CTE:

Selects the top K activity sequences based on their rank.
top_k_case_ids CTE:

Retrieves the case_id of cases that belong to the top K activity sequences.
Final SELECT:

Retrieves all events from the original event_log that belong to the cases identified in the top_k_case_ids CTE.
Example
Suppose the event_log table contains the following data:

case_id	activity	timestamp
1	A	2023-01-01 10:00:00
1	B	2023-01-01 10:05:00
2	A	2023-01-02 11:00:00
2	B	2023-01-02 11:05:00
3	B	2023-01-03 12:00:00
3	A	2023-01-03 12:05:00
For K = 1:

Sequences:

Case 1: A, B
Case 2: A, B
Case 3: B, A
Frequencies:

Ranked sequences:

A, B: rank 1
B, A: rank 2
Top K=1: A, B

Cases 1 and 2 are included

Events from cases 1 and 2 are selected

The final result will be:

case_id	activity	timestamp
1	A	2023-01-01 10:00:00
1	B	2023-01-01 10:05:00
2	A	2023-01-02 11:00:00
2	B	2023-01-02 11:05:00
This query ensures that the top K process variants are correctly identified and that only the events from those variants are returned.
