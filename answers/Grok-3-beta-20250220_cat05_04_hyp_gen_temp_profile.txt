### Analysis of Temporal Profile Model Anomalies

Based on the provided temporal profile model, several anomalies stand out due to unusually short or long average times between activities, as well as unexpected standard deviations. Below, I outline these anomalies, propose hypotheses for their causes, and suggest SQL queries to verify them using the `claim_events` table.

---

#### 1. Identified Anomalies

- **R to P (Receive to Approve): 25 hours average, STDEV = 1 hour**
  - The average time of ~1.04 days is reasonable, but the very low standard deviation (1 hour) is suspicious. This suggests an almost fixed timeline for approvals, which is unlikely in a natural process involving human review or variable claim complexity.
  
- **P to N (Approve to Notify): 7 days average, STDEV = 2 days**
  - A 7-day average delay between approval and notification is excessively long for what should be a straightforward step. The high standard deviation (2 days) indicates significant inconsistency, with some notifications occurring quickly and others delayed substantially.

- **A to C (Assign to Close): 2 hours average, STDEV = 1 hour**
  - An average of 2 hours from assignment to closure is unusually short if all intended steps (e.g., Evaluate, Approve) are followed. This could imply that some claims bypass critical steps, leading to premature closure.

- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify): 5 minutes average, STDEV = 1 minute**
  - A 5-minute average transition is extremely fast, suggesting either an automated process with no meaningful delay or a potential skipping of necessary verification or documentation steps before notifying the customer.

#### 2. Hypotheses on Anomalies

- **R to P (Receive to Approve)**
  - **Hypothesis:** Approvals might be automated or rubber-stamped on a fixed schedule (e.g., batch processing every 24 hours), reducing variability unnaturally.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis:** Data entry errors could truncate timestamps, making approvals appear to happen at predictable intervals.

- **P to N (Approve to Notify)**
  - **Hypothesis:** A bottleneck exists due to limited staff availability for notifications, causing a backlog that delays some claims significantly while others are processed immediately.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis:** Notifications might depend on external systems or customer responses, introducing unpredictable delays.

- **A to C (Assign to Close)**
  - **Hypothesis:** Some claims are closed prematurely without proper evaluation or approval, possibly due to adjuster discretion or system glitches marking claims as resolved.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis:** Simple claims (e.g., low amounts) might follow an expedited process, skipping intermediate steps.

- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**
  - **Hypothesis:** An automated notification system triggers immediately after evaluation, but this speed might bypass required quality checks or customer communication protocols.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis:** Timestamp errors or overlapping activities (e.g., evaluation and notification logged simultaneously) could artificially shorten this interval.

#### 3. Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

Below are SQL queries to investigate these anomalies using the `claim_events` table, correlating them with other tables where relevant.

##### **Anomaly: R to P (Receive to Approve)**
- **Goal:** Identify claims where the time between Receive and Approve deviates from the expected range (e.g., outside AVG ± 2*STDEV: 90000 ± 7200 seconds).
- **Query:**
```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds,
        c.claim_type,
        c.claim_amount
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    time_diff_seconds,
    claim_type,
    claim_amount
FROM time_diffs
WHERE time_diff_seconds < 82800 OR time_diff_seconds > 97200  -- Outside 90000 ± 7200
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds;
```
- **Purpose:** Check if certain claim types or amounts consistently show rigid timing, suggesting automation or errors.

##### **Anomaly: P to N (Approve to Notify)**
- **Goal:** Find claims with unusually long (>9 days) or short (<5 days) delays between Approve and Notify, and link to adjusters.
- **Query:**
```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 86400 AS time_diff_days,
        ce1.resource AS adjuster_resource,
        c.claim_type,
        a.region
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
    JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    time_diff_days,
    adjuster_resource,
    claim_type,
    region
FROM time_diffs
WHERE time_diff_days < 5 OR time_diff_days > 9  -- Outside 7 ± 2 days
ORDER BY time_diff_days DESC;
```
- **Purpose:** Investigate if delays correlate with specific adjusters, regions, or claim types, pointing to resource constraints or process issues.

##### **Anomaly: A to C (Assign to Close)**
- **Goal:** Identify claims closed within 3 hours of assignment and check for missing intermediate steps (E, P).
- **Query:**
```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ce3.activity IN ('E', 'P') THEN 1 END) AS intermediate_steps
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    LEFT JOIN claim_events ce3 ON ce1.claim_id = ce3.claim_id 
        AND ce3.timestamp > ce1.timestamp 
        AND ce3.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    GROUP BY ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp, ce2.timestamp
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    time_diff_seconds / 3600.0 AS time_diff_hours,
    intermediate_steps
FROM time_diffs
WHERE time_diff_seconds <= 10800  -- Less than 3 hours
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds;
```
- **Purpose:** Confirm if quick closures lack evaluation or approval, indicating premature resolution.

##### **Anomaly: E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**
- **Goal:** Find claims with Evaluate-to-Notify times under 6 minutes and check adjuster involvement.
- **Query:**
```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds,
        ce1.resource AS adjuster_resource,
        c.claim_amount
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    time_diff_seconds,
    adjuster_resource,
    claim_amount
FROM time_diffs
WHERE time_diff_seconds <= 360  -- Less than 6 minutes
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds;
```
- **Purpose:** Determine if rapid transitions are tied to automation (e.g., consistent resource IDs) or errors, and if they correlate with claim amounts.
