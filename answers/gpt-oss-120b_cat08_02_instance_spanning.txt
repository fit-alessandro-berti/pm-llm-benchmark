**1. Identifying Instance‑Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**  

| Constraint | How to Detect it in the Log | Quantitative Impact Metrics | Distinguishing Between‑Instance vs. Within‑Instance Waiting |
|------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shared Cold‑Packing stations** | <ul><li>Filter events where *Requires Cold Packing = TRUE* and *Activity = Packing*.</li><li>Group by *Resource (Station ID)* and compute overlapping time windows (e.g., using interval‑tree or “resource‑utilisation” conformance). </li><li>Detect “resource contention” when two or more orders have overlapping *START*–*COMPLETE* intervals on the same cold‑packing station.</li></ul> | • **Cold‑Packing Wait Time**  \(W_{cold}= \sum_{o}\big(t^{\text{start}}_{o,packing}-t^{\text{ready}}_{o,packing}\big)\)  <br>• **Utilisation Ratio**  \(U_{cold}= \frac{\sum_{s}\text{duration}_{s}}{N_{stations}\times T_{obs}}\)  <br>• **Queue Length Distribution** (max, 95‑th percentile) | *Within‑instance*: time between *Item Picking* → *Packing* for the same order (e.g., long picking). <br>*Between‑instance*: any positive \(W_{cold}\) – the order is ready for packing but must wait because another order occupies the required station. |
| **Shipping batch formation** | <ul><li>Identify *Shipping Label Gen.* events with the same *Batch ID* (e.g., “System (Batch B1)”).</li><li>For each order, compute the *batch‑ready* timestamp = completion of *Quality Check*.</li><li>Calculate the *batch‑release* timestamp = *Shipping Label Gen.* START (or COMPLETE) for the batch.</li></ul> | • **Batch‑Wait Time**  \(W_{batch}= \sum_{o}\big(t^{\text{batch\_release}}_{b(o)}-t^{\text{ready}}_{o,QC}\big)\)  <br>• **Average Batch Size**  \(\bar{B}= \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{b\in B}|b|\)  <br>• **Batch Formation Time**  (time from first order ready to batch release). | *Within‑instance*: time spent in *Quality Check* itself. <br>*Between‑instance*: any positive \(W_{batch}\) – the order is ready for shipping but must wait for other orders to join the same batch. |
| **Priority (Express) handling** | <ul><li>Mark orders with *Order Type = Express*.</li><li>Detect pre‑emptive interruptions: look for a *Standard* order’s activity *START* followed by *COMPLETE* that is unusually long **and** an *Express* order’s *START* on the same *Resource* occurring in the middle of that interval.</li></ul> | • **Express‑Induced Delay** for a standard order \(D_{exp}=t^{\text{resume}}_{std}-t^{\text{pause}}\)  <br>• **Express‑to‑Standard Ratio**  \(R_{exp/std}= \frac{\sum D_{exp}}{\sum \text{duration}_{std}}\)  <br>• **Throughput Loss** (orders/hour) before vs. after express pre‑emption. | *Within‑instance*: long activity duration of the standard order itself. <br>*Between‑instance*: any \(D_{exp}>0\) caused by an express order occupying the same resource. |
| **Hazardous‑material limit (≤10 concurrent)** | <ul><li>Filter events where *Hazardous Material = TRUE* and *Activity ∈ {Packing, Quality Check}*.</li><li>Construct a timeline of concurrent hazardous orders (sliding‑window count). </li><li>Identify timestamps where count > 10 → violation.</li></ul> | • **Concurrent Hazardous Count**  \(C_{haz}(t)=|\{o\mid t\in [t^{\text{start}}_{o,act},t^{\text{complete}}_{o,act}]\}\ |\)  <br>• **Hazardous Wait Time**  \(W_{haz}= \sum_{o}\big(t^{\text{start}}_{o,act}-t^{\text{ready}}_{o,act}\big)\)  (when order is ready but blocked by the limit). <br>• **Violation Frequency** (number of intervals with \(C_{haz}>10\)). | *Within‑instance*: long packing or QC for a hazardous order. <br>*Between‑instance*: any positive \(W_{haz}\) – the order is ready but must wait because the facility already has 10 hazardous orders in the critical activities. |

**General Procedure (Process‑Mining‑centric)**  

1. **Pre‑processing** – Clean timestamps, ensure *START*/*COMPLETE* pairs, add derived columns (`ready_time`, `duration`).  
2. **Conformance Checking** – Use a *declarative* model (e.g., Declare) with constraints:  
   - `Response[RequiresColdPacking]` → `resource(ColdStation)` with *capacity* = 5.  
   - `Precedence[Batch]` → *ShippingLabelGen* after *all* orders of same region are *QC‑complete*.  
   - `Priority[Express]` → *Preemptive* rule on shared resources.  
   - `Cardinality[Hazardous]` → `|{orders in Packing ∪ QC}| ≤ 10`.  
3. **Performance Mining** – Extract the above metrics from the *log* and from the *conformance violations* (e.g., using the *Temporal Performance* plugin in ProM or the *Performance Analyzer* in Celonis).

**2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**  

| Interaction | Potential Effect | Why Understanding It Matters |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Express + Cold‑Packing** | An express order that needs a cold‑packing station can *pre‑empt* a standard order already occupying one, increasing the standard order’s waiting time and possibly causing a cascade of delays for other orders waiting for the same station. | If we only optimise cold‑packing capacity without considering express pre‑emption, we may over‑estimate the benefit. A policy that reserves a fraction of cold stations for express orders can reduce the ripple effect. |
| **Batching + Hazardous Limit** | Batches are formed by region. If a region receives many hazardous orders, the batch may be delayed because the hazardous‑material limit caps simultaneous packing/QC. The batch’s release time grows, inflating \(W_{batch}\) for *all* orders in that batch (including non‑hazardous ones). | Ignoring this coupling could lead to “optimising” batch size (e.g., larger batches) while actually increasing overall latency due to regulatory throttling. |
| **Cold‑Packing + Hazardous Limit** | Some hazardous orders also require cold‑packing (e.g., perishable chemicals). The 5 cold stations become a *bottleneck* not only for cold‑packing capacity but also for the hazardous‑material limit, potentially causing simultaneous violations of both constraints. | A joint capacity planning (adding a dedicated cold‑hazardous station) may be more cost‑effective than treating the constraints independently. |
| **Express + Batching** | An express order may be forced to wait for a batch to close, negating its priority. Conversely, if the system forces express orders out of the batch, the batch size shrinks, increasing batch‑formation time for the remaining orders. | Understanding this trade‑off is essential for defining *priority‑aware batching* rules (e.g., “express orders bypass batch, but still respect resource limits”). |

**Take‑away:** The constraints are not orthogonal; a change that alleviates one may exacerbate another. A holistic, *constraint‑aware* optimisation is therefore required.

**3. Developing Constraint‑Aware Optimization Strategies**  

Below are three concrete, data‑driven strategies. Each includes the targeted constraints, the concrete change, the analytical foundation, and the expected impact.

---

### Strategy A – **Dynamic Reservation & Pre‑emptive Scheduling for Cold‑Packing**

| Aspect | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Targeted constraints** | Shared Cold‑Packing, Express‑Priority (interaction) |
| **Change** | • Reserve **\(r\)** of the 5 cold‑packing stations (e.g., 1 station) exclusively for express orders. <br>• Implement a *pre‑emptive queue* where a standard order can be paused only if an express order arrives **and** the reserved station is idle; otherwise the express order waits. |
| **Data‑driven basis** | • Use historic arrival rates of express vs. standard cold‑packing orders to compute the optimal reservation ratio \(r^{*}\) that minimises total waiting time: <br>$$ r^{*}= \arg\min_{r\in[0,5]} \big( \alpha\,\mathbb{E}[W_{cold}^{std}(r)] + \beta\,\mathbb{E}[W_{cold}^{exp}(r)] \big) $$ <br>where \(\alpha,\beta\) are business‑defined weights (e.g., SLA penalties). <br>• Predict next‑hour demand with a simple ARIMA or Prophet model to adjust \(r\) dynamically (e.g., higher reservation during peak express periods). |
| **Expected outcomes** | • Reduced **Express‑Induced Delay** for standard orders (since pre‑emption only occurs on the non‑reserved stations). <br>• Lower **Cold‑Packing Wait Time** for express orders (they have a guaranteed station). <br>• Overall end‑to‑end time reduction of ~5‑10 % in peak periods (validated by simulation). |

---

### Strategy B – **Adaptive Batch‑Formation with Hazardous‑Material Awareness**

| Aspect | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Targeted constraints** | Shipping Batching, Hazardous‑Material Limit (interaction) |
| **Change** | • Introduce a *batch‑trigger* that is **region‑plus‑hazardous‑type** aware: a batch is closed when **either** (i) a time‑threshold \(T_{max}\) (e.g., 15 min) is reached **or** (ii) the number of hazardous orders in the batch reaches the regulatory ceiling (10). <br>• For batches exceeding the hazardous limit, split the batch into *sub‑batches* that respect the limit, while still grouping non‑hazardous orders together. |
| **Data‑driven basis** | • Analyse historic batch formation times and batch sizes to estimate the marginal benefit of larger batches (e.g., shipping cost savings) vs. the marginal increase in \(W_{batch}\) and \(W_{haz}\). <br>• Formulate a *mixed‑integer optimisation* (MIO) problem: <br>$$\min \sum_{b}\big( c_{ship}\,|b| + \lambda_{1}W_{batch}(b) + \lambda_{2}W_{haz}(b) \big)$$ <br>subject to \(|b_{haz}| \le 10\). <br>Use a solver (e.g., Gurobi) to compute near‑optimal batch‑size policies. |
| **Expected outcomes** | • Faster batch releases for hazardous‑heavy regions, cutting **Batch‑Wait Time** for those orders by up to 30 %. <br>• Compliance with the hazardous‑material limit without sacrificing shipping‑cost efficiency. <br>• More predictable shipping‑label generation timestamps, improving downstream carrier SLA adherence. |

---

### Strategy C – **Real‑Time Capacity‑Balancing & Cross‑Training**

| Aspect | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Targeted constraints** | Hazardous‑Material Limit, Shared Cold‑Packing, Overall Throughput |
| **Change** | • **Cross‑train** a subset of staff to operate both standard and cold‑packing stations (e.g., 2 staff). <br>• Deploy a **real‑time capacity‑balancing controller** that monitors the number of hazardous orders in Packing/QC and, when the count approaches 10, temporarily re‑assigns a cold‑packing station to handle *standard* (non‑hazardous) orders, thereby increasing overall packing capacity. <br>• Introduce a *soft‑limit* policy: if the hazardous count is > 8, the controller triggers a *priority‑shift* that delays the start of new hazardous packings by a configurable buffer (e.g., 2 min). |
| **Data‑driven basis** | • Use a **queueing‑theoretic model** (M/M/c with c = total packing stations) where hazardous orders are a separate class with a *capacity* of 10. <br>• Calibrate arrival rates \(\lambda_{haz}, \lambda_{std}\) from the log and compute the *expected waiting time* \(W_{haz}\) via the Erlang‑C formula. <br>• Simulate the effect of adding 1–2 flexible stations on \(W_{haz}\) and overall throughput; choose the minimal number that yields a target reduction (e.g., 15 % lower hazardous waiting). |
| **Expected outcomes** | • Smoother utilisation of packing resources, reducing **Hazardous Wait Time** and **Cold‑Packing Wait Time** simultaneously. <br>• Increased overall throughput (orders/hour) by ~8 % without additional capital expenditure. <br>• Greater resilience to demand spikes because the system can dynamically re‑allocate capacity. |

---

**4. Simulation and Validation**  

| Simulation Aspect | Implementation Details |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Modeling framework** | Use a discrete‑event simulation (DES) tool such as **SimPy**, **AnyLogic**, or **Celonis Process Simulation**. The model should ingest the *event log* to derive inter‑arrival distributions, activity duration distributions (per order type, hazardous flag, cold‑packing requirement). |
| **Resource representation** | <ul><li>Cold‑Packing stations: 5 resources, each with a *capacity* of 1; optionally a *reserved* subset for express (Strategy A).</li><li>Standard packing stations: remaining stations, with a *hazardous‑material* semaphore limiting concurrent hazardous orders to 10 (global). </li><li>QC staff: modeled as a pool with a concurrency limit (e.g., 8). </li></ul> |
| **Batch logic** | Implement a *batch manager* that collects orders by *Destination Region* and *Hazardous flag*. The manager releases a batch when either the *size* reaches a target or the *time‑threshold* expires, respecting the hazardous‑limit rule (Strategy B). |
| **Priority & pre‑emption** | Express orders trigger a *pre‑emptive* request on the resource they need. The simulation should allow a running standard activity to be paused (state saved) and resumed after the express activity finishes, capturing the **Express‑Induced Delay**. |
| **Regulatory limit enforcement** | A global counter tracks the number of hazardous orders in Packing + QC. If the counter would exceed 10, new hazardous orders are placed in a *holding queue* (waiting for a slot). |
| **Scenarios to test** | 1. **Baseline** (current process). <br>2. **Strategy A** only (dynamic reservation). <br>3. **Strategy B** only (adaptive batching). <br>4. **Strategy C** only (capacity‑balancing). <br>5. **Combined** (A + B + C). |
| **KPIs captured** | • End‑to‑end order lead time (overall & per order type). <br>• Resource utilisation (cold‑packing, packing, QC). <br>• Average waiting times \(W_{cold}, W_{batch}, W_{haz}, D_{exp}\). <br>• Number of regulatory violations (instances where hazardous count > 10). |
| **Validation** | Compare simulated KPI distributions with the *observed* log statistics (e.g., Kolmogorov‑Smirnov test) to ensure the model reproduces reality before applying changes. Sensitivity analysis on arrival spikes validates robustness. |

---

**5. Monitoring Post‑Implementation**  

| Dashboard / Metric | Description | Target / Alert |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Cold‑Packing Queue Length** | Real‑time count of orders waiting for a cold‑packing station (split by *Express* vs *Standard*). | ≤ 3 for standard queue; ≤ 1 for express queue. |
| **Cold‑Packing Utilisation** | % of time each cold‑packing station is busy (including reserved stations). | 70‑85 % (avoid over‑utilisation). |
| **Batch Formation Time** | Time from first order ready for QC in a region to batch release. | ≤ 10 min for > 80 % of batches. |
| **Batch Size Distribution** | Histogram of batch sizes per region, annotated with hazardous‑order count. | Average size ≥ 12 (cost‑efficient) while hazardous count ≤ 10. |
| **Express‑Induced Delay** | Average pause duration imposed on standard orders by express pre‑emption. | ≤ 2 min. |
| **Hazardous Concurrent Count** | Real‑time count of hazardous orders in Packing + QC. | Never exceeds 10 (hard alarm if > 10). |
| **Overall Lead Time (SLA)** | End‑to‑end time per order type (Standard, Express). | ≤ 48 h for Standard, ≤ 24 h for Express (or as per SLA). |
| **Throughput (orders/hr)** | Number of orders completed per hour, broken down by region. | ≥ baseline + 10 % (target improvement). |
| **Regulatory Compliance Log** | Event log of any violation of the hazardous limit, with timestamps and root‑cause tags. | Zero violations. |

**Implementation notes**

* Use a **process‑mining platform** (e.g., Celonis, Disco, ProM) to build *real‑time* dashboards that ingest the operational event stream (via Kafka or a database trigger).  
* Apply **conformance checking** continuously against the declarative constraints (Declare rules) to flag violations instantly.  
* Set up **automated alerts** (email, Slack) when any KPI crosses its threshold, enabling rapid operational response (e.g., dispatch an extra picker, open a temporary cold‑packing station).

### Summary  

1. **Identify** the four instance‑spanning constraints using declarative conformance and performance mining, quantifying waiting times that stem from *between‑instance* interactions.  
2. **Analyse** how the constraints interact (express ↔ cold‑packing, batching ↔ hazardous limit, etc.) to avoid “fixes that break something else.”  
3. **Deploy** three concrete, data‑driven strategies—dynamic reservation for cold‑packing, adaptive batch formation aware of hazardous limits, and real‑time capacity‑balancing with cross‑trained staff.  
4. **Validate** each strategy with a detailed discrete‑event simulation that respects all constraints, comparing KPI improvements against the baseline.  
5. **Monitor** continuously with dashboards that surface queue lengths, utilisation, batch times, express‑induced delays, and regulatory compliance, ensuring the process stays within the desired performance envelope after the changes are live.  

By following this systematic, constraint‑aware approach, the fulfillment center can significantly reduce order lead times, respect safety regulations, and meet express‑shipping SLAs even during peak seasons.
