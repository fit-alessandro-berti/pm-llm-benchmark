The graphic is made up of three separate elements.

In panel(a) two “proplet” classes are drawn as little activity diagrams. On the left is a lab visit: it starts at a solid black circle, goes through an order entry step performed by a doctor or lab assistant, a blood sample is taken, a result is received and judged. If everything is fine the report is sent and the process ends, if not the tests are done again, an updated result is received and then a report is sent. On the right is a lab test: it starts, a chemical analyst performs the test, makes a report, finishes the lab test and ends; there is a branch to perform the test again and provide an updated report. The two proplets talk to each other via two dashed “channels”: an “Order system” for ordering tests and a “HIS” (health information system) for sending and receiving results and updates. Horizontal arrows inside those dashed boxes show where messages are exchanged.

Panel(b) distils that into a simple class diagram: a “Lab visit” requires one or more “Lab test” instances, with multiplicities 1..1 on the visit side and 1..* on the test side.

Panel(c) gives a concrete example of a performative, as a table with columns for time, channel, sender, receivers, action, content, scope and direction. At 11:00, over the Order system, the “Lab visit–John” proplet sends a Create message to “Lab test–HGB John” asking “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”, marked as a private, outgoing message.
