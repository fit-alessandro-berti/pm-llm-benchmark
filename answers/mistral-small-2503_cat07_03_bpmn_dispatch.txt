The diagram is a detailed flowchart illustrating the process of shipping goods, divided into three main sections: Logistics, Dispatch of Goods (Computer Hardware Shop Secretary), and Warehouse. The process begins with the initiation of shipping goods, where the order details are reviewed. The flowchart then branches into checking if insurance is required, with a decision point leading to either insuring the parcel or proceeding directly to writing the package label. Another decision point assesses if special handling is needed, which, if yes, involves getting offers from logistic companies and selecting one to place an order. The process then moves to packaging the goods, with a delay notification step if the packaging takes 48 hours. Following this, the shipment paperwork is filled out, and the package is moved to the pickup area, marking the shipment as prepared. The diagram effectively outlines the sequential and conditional steps involved in preparing and shipping goods, highlighting the roles of different departments and the decision points that influence the process flow.
