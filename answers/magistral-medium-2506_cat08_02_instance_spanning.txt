# **Optimization Strategy for E-commerce Fulfillment Center Using Process Mining**

## **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

### **Methods for Detection and Quantification**
To identify and quantify the impact of instance-spanning constraints, we leverage **process mining techniques** such as:
- **Performance Analysis (Bottleneck Detection):**
  - Use **performance spectra** to identify activities with high waiting or idle times due to shared resources (e.g., Cold-Packing stations).
  - Measure **flow time** (from order receipt to shipping) to detect delays caused by batching or regulatory limits.
- **Resource Utilization Analysis:**
  - Apply **resource profiles** to track occupancy of Cold-Packing stations and identify contention.
  - Use **queue length analysis** to measure waiting times for shared resources.
- **Dependency Graph Analysis:**
  - Model dependencies between orders (e.g., batching delays, express order interruptions) using **sequence and concurrence graphs**.
- **Constraint-Specific Metrics:**
  - **Cold-Packing Contention:** Measure average waiting time for cold-packing-required orders.
  - **Batching Delays:** Track the difference between order completion and batch shipping label generation.
  - **Priority Handling Impact:** Compare flow times of standard vs. express orders, identifying cases where standard orders were paused.
  - **Hazardous Material Limits:** Monitor the number of hazardous orders in Packing/Quality Check simultaneously to detect throttling effects.

### **Differentiating Waiting Time Causes**
To isolate delays caused by instance-spanning constraints vs. within-instance factors:
- **Intra-instance delays** (e.g., slow picking) can be identified by comparing activity durations against historical averages.
- **Inter-instance delays** (e.g., waiting for Cold-Packing) are detected when an order is idle while another order occupies a required resource.
- **Batching delays** are measured by tracking the time between an order’s completion and its shipping label generation.

## **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**

### **Key Interactions Between Constraints**
1. **Cold-Packing + Priority Handling:**
   - An express order requiring Cold-Packing may preempt a standard order, increasing waiting times for non-express cold-packing orders.
2. **Batching + Hazardous Material Limits:**
   - If multiple hazardous orders are batched for the same region, they may exceed the 10-order limit during packing/quality check, forcing delays.
3. **Priority Handling + Batching:**
   - Express orders may bypass batching rules, leading to inefficient shipping routes if not coordinated.
4. **Cold-Packing + Hazardous Material Limits:**
   - If a hazardous order requires Cold-Packing, it may block both a Cold-Packing station and consume one of the 10 hazardous slots simultaneously.

### **Why Understanding Interactions Matters**
- A solution addressing one constraint (e.g., adding Cold-Packing stations) may inadvertently worsen another (e.g., more hazardous orders in packing).
- Without considering interactions, optimization efforts may fail to improve overall throughput or even introduce new bottlenecks.

## **3. Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations**
**Constraint Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing stations.
**Proposed Changes:**
- Implement a **priority-aware scheduling algorithm** that:
  - Allocates Cold-Packing stations to express orders first.
  - Uses predictive analytics to forecast cold-packing demand and dynamically adjust assignments.
- Introduce **flexible station allocation** (e.g., temporarily converting standard packing stations to Cold-Packing during peak demand).

**Data-Driven Approach:**
- Use historical data to predict peak cold-packing demand periods.
- Implement real-time monitoring of queue lengths to trigger dynamic reallocation.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Reduced waiting times for cold-packing orders.
- Better utilization of limited Cold-Packing resources.

### **Strategy 2: Adaptive Batching with Hazardous Material Awareness**
**Constraint Addressed:** Batching delays & hazardous material limits.
**Proposed Changes:**
- Modify batching logic to:
  - Prioritize forming batches that include hazardous orders to avoid exceeding the 10-order limit.
  - Dynamically adjust batch sizes based on order types (e.g., smaller batches for hazardous items).
- Allow **partial batch releases** if waiting for a few orders causes excessive delays for others.

**Data-Driven Approach:**
- Analyze historical batching patterns to optimize batch size thresholds.
- Use simulation to test different batching policies under varying order mixes.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Reduced delays for non-hazardous orders waiting on batch formation.
- Compliance with hazardous material limits while maintaining throughput.

---

### **Strategy 3: Priority-Aware Preemption with Fairness Constraints**
**Constraint Addressed:** Priority handling interruptions.
**Proposed Changes:**
- Implement a **preemption policy** that:
  - Allows express orders to interrupt standard orders at packing stations.
  - Ensures fairness by limiting the number of consecutive priority interruptions per standard order.
- Introduce **buffer zones** for standard orders to resume after interruptions without excessive rework.

**Data-Driven Approach:**
- Analyze past interruptions to determine optimal interruption thresholds.
- Use process mining to identify stages where express orders cause the most disruption.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Faster processing of express orders without excessively delaying standard orders.
- Better balance between urgency and fairness.

## **4. Simulation and Validation**

### **Simulation Approach**
Before implementation, we simulate the proposed strategies using:
- **Discrete-event simulation** modeling order flows, resource contention, and batching.
- **Agent-based modeling** to simulate interactions between express vs. standard orders, hazardous material constraints, and Cold-Packing station allocation.

**Key Focus Areas in Simulation:**
1. **Resource Contention:**
   - Model Cold-Packing station queues under dynamic allocation policies.
2. **Batching Dynamics:**
   - Simulate different batching strategies to measure their impact on shipping delays.
3. **Priority Handling Impact:**
   - Test how different preemption rules affect express and standard order flow times.
4. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Ensure hazardous material limits are never exceeded while optimizing throughput.

**Validation Metrics:**
- End-to-end flow time reduction.
- Compliance with hazardous material limits.
- Resource utilization efficiency (e.g., Cold-Packing station idle time reduction).

## **5. Monitoring Post-Implementation**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to Track**
| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Average Cold-Packing Wait Time** | Measure impact of dynamic allocation. |
| **Time Spent in Batching Queues** | Evaluate adaptive batching effectiveness. |
| **Express vs. Standard Order Flow Time Ratio** | Ensure priority handling is balanced. |
| **Hazardous Orders in Packing/Quality Check Simultaneously** | Ensure compliance with regulatory limits. |
| **Resource Utilization Rate** | Identify under/over-used packing stations. |

### **Process Mining Dashboards**
We implement real-time dashboards with:
1. **Bottleneck Heatmaps** – Visualize delays caused by Cold-Packing or hazardous material limits.
2. **Batching Efficiency Monitor** – Track batch formation times and identify delays.
3. **Priority Handling Impact Tracker** – Compare flow times before/after preemption policies.
4. **Regulatory Compliance Alerts** – Flag when hazardous material limits are nearing capacity.

### **Continuous Improvement Loop**
- Use **process mining drift detection** to identify if new bottlenecks emerge after changes.
- Regularly update simulation models with fresh data to refine strategies.
