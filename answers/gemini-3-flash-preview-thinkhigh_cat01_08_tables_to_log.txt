To create a comprehensive event log for process mining, I have integrated the provided tables into a single, chronologically ordered sequence per `order_id`. 

### Assumptions and Data Handling Notes:
1.  **Multiple Item Picking:** Where an order had multiple items, I have kept them as individual "Item Picked" events to reflect the granular warehouse activity.
2.  **Split Deliveries:** For Order 1002, which had multiple deliveries (`DLV-5002` and `DLV-5003`), each dispatch and arrival is listed as a separate event to capture the complexity of the logistics process.
3.  **Invoice/Payment Links:** Payments were linked to the Case ID via the `Invoice Table`.
4.  **Resource Mapping:** Resource IDs (e.g., SP-001) have been mapped to their corresponding names and roles (e.g., Alice Brown) for better readability.
5.  **Incomplete Processes:** Order 1004 appears to have stopped after the picking stage (no delivery or invoice data available); it is included up to the last recorded activity.
