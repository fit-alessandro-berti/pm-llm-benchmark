### Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules)

#### Identifying Violations

1. **Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case**
   - In the provided Event Log, Case 1 illustrates this sequence.
   - Violations occur when a credit check is skipped after the application and before risk assessment, or when documentation is finalized after a rejection. Both scenarios violate the strict sequence.

2. **Event Log**
   - Table 1 above summarizes the event log for Case 1.
   - Both Risks 1 and 2 in the event log indicate a violation of the sequence.
   - Risks 1 and 2 fail to occur in the required order due to application receipt followed by credit check.

3. **Applying Desiderata**
   - Desiderata violations include failing to follow the recommended timeline and skipping the follow-up call.
   - In Case 2, the risk assessment occurs before the credit check (Risk 2), violating the normative rule. Additionally, since the application was received before the risk assessment, the sequence for risk assessment and loan decision is incorrect (Risk 1).
   - In Case 3, the follow-up call is skipped (Risk 2), and the application's receipt is ignored for more than 24 hours (desideratum 1), also violating the normative sequence.

### Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)

#### Identifying Desiderata Violations

1. **Timing Recommendations**:
   - While not severe, violating these is not a serious problem, but ideally they should be followed.
   - For example, the credit check should be completed within a short time window after the application is received (e.g., within 24 hours), and the applicant should be informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision).

2. **Follow-up Call and Documentation Completion**:
   - Failing to adhere to these timing recommendations or skipping the follow-up call is not a serious violation.
   - These are considered “desiderata” rather than hard rules. However, such behavior can lead to inefficiencies and less than optimal outcomes.

3. **Application Receipt and Decision**:
   - Failing to maintain consistency with the sequence of applying for credit, performing a risk assessment, and then making a loan decision can cause confusion for the applicant and decrease efficiency for the business.

#### Interpreting and Justifying Behavior

In both parts, common issues arise due to adherence to strict rules and the recommended but not strict desiderata.

- The credit check, risk assessment, loan decision, and informing the applicant in the correct sequence are well-maintained by the business, adhering to strict rules.
- The application receipt followed by the risk assessment violation in Case 1 and the decision decision decision change highlighting the importance of following the sequential order of activity, even if adherence to exact sequence isn't required.
- Failure to inform applicants promptly (desideratum 1) and to finalize documentation after a rejection (desideratum 2) can negatively impact outcomes. However, business constraints (desideratum 3) do not typically dictate behavior.

For Part 2, including being more proactive in the follow-up call and adhering to the stipulated timeline enhances efficiency and reduces inefficiencies, given that neglecting these tasks might result in improved working processes and optimized outcomes.

### Finalize Methodologies

1. **Auditing**:
   - The best approach is to perform a systematic review of all events to ensure alignment with both the normative and desiderata standards.
   - Emphasize clear communication to reinforce adherence to the rules, including maintain feedback in the Event Log to monitor for adherence to the expected sequence.

2. **Training**:
   - Based on findings, the training and awareness programs should explicitly include the compliance to strict rules and recommended best practices in the transactional process.

3. **Observation**:
   - Include regular review of business activities to directly observe and identify and take corrective action if normative behavior patterns begin to show signs of deviations that could undermine compliance.

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Constantly track the application flow and the outcome accuracy, as recommended best practices and normative behavior should be continuously monitored to stay aligned with the expected sequence of events.

5. **Targeted Refresher Training**:
   - Add periodic training sessions specifically to reinforce the compliance to normative and desiderata guidelines for all personnel involved in handling loan applications.
