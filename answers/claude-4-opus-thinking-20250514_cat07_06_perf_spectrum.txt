This is a Sankey diagram (or alluvial diagram) that visualizes the flow of what appears to be a fine collection process over time from 2000 to 2013. The diagram has three main horizontal levels representing different stages in the process:

1. **"Send Fine"** (top level) - shown in gray
2. **"Insert Fine Notification"** (middle level) - the transition point
3. **"Send for Credit Collection"** (bottom level) - shown with pink/red coloring

The diagram shows how cases flow between these three stages over the 13-year period. The gray flows descending from the top represent fines moving from the initial "Send Fine" stage to the notification stage. The pink/red flows show cases transitioning from the notification stage to credit collection.

The width of each flow represents the volume or quantity of cases moving between stages at different time periods. The visualization effectively shows patterns in the fine collection process, including when larger volumes of cases moved to collection (indicated by thicker pink/red bands) and the overall flow patterns throughout the timeline.

This type of visualization is particularly useful for understanding process flows, identifying bottlenecks, and seeing how the volume and timing of transitions between stages have changed over the years.
