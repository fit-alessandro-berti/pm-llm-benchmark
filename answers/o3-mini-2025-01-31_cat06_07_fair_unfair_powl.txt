Below are two sample implementations expressed in Pythonstyle pseudocode using POWL constructs. The first model (Unfair) demonstrates an XOR branch where one branch (“CommunityAffiliationCheck”) gives candidates with a community affiliation a subtle advantage over those who simply go through the “CulturalFitCheck.” The second model (Fair) removes the biased branch so that every candidate follows the same cultural evaluation.


Model 1: POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model the workflow proceeds as follows:
•ReceiveApplication
•DataCompletenessCheck is performed (with a loop that, if information is missing, calls RequestMoreInfo and then rechecks completeness)
•SkillAssessment is executed
•An XOR branch is introduced:
– One branch is CulturalFitCheck (standard evaluation)
– The other branch is CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives an uplift for candidates with local affiliations)
•ManagerialReview is then done on borderline cases
•FinalDecision is made

Below is the corresponding POWL model code snippet:

-----------------------------------------------------
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication       = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck    = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo          = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment          = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck         = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck= Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview         = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision            = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for resume parsing & completeness check:
# This loop executes DataCompletenessCheck and if issues occur, triggers RequestMoreInfo, then loops.
completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP,
                                  children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define an XOR branch for cultural evaluation:
# Either go the standard CulturalFitCheck or the community-based branch.
cultural_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR,
                               children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Construct overall sequential partial order process:
# The steps must be performed in sequence.
process_nodes = [ReceiveApplication, completeness_loop, SkillAssessment, cultural_choice, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
powl_model_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=process_nodes)

# Define the sequential order:
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, completeness_loop)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_choice)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_choice, ManagerialReview)
powl_model_unfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# (At this point, "powl_model_unfair" represents the full hiring process with potential bias via the XOR branch.)
-----------------------------------------------------


Model 2: POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model all candidates follow a single cultural evaluation path.
•ReceiveApplication
•DataCompletenessCheck (with a loop that calls RequestMoreInfo as needed)
•SkillAssessment
•All candidates then go through the same CulturalFitCheck (with no alternative branch)
•ManagerialReview and FinalDecision follow in sequence

Below is the corresponding POWL model code snippet:

-----------------------------------------------------
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication    = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo       = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment       = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck      = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview      = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision         = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for resume parsing & completeness check:
completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP,
                                  children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# No XOR branch is used here – all candidates move to the same CulturalFitCheck.
# Build the overall sequential partial order process:
process_nodes = [ReceiveApplication, completeness_loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
powl_model_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=process_nodes)

# Define order edges:
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, completeness_loop)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
powl_model_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# (The model "powl_model_fair" represents a uniform process, thereby removing the potential bias from branching.)
-----------------------------------------------------


Summary

•Model 1 uses an XOR operator to choose between a standard cultural evaluation and one that introduces a bias (CommunityAffiliationCheck) that may favor some applicants.
•Model 2 eliminates this selective branch so that every candidate is rated via the same CulturalFitCheck, ensuring a fairer process.

These POWL models capture both the intended process sequencing (with loops and strict ordering) and the different handling of the cultural evaluation stage.
