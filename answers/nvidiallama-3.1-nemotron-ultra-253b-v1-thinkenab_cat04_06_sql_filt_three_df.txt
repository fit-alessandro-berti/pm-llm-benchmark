Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that filters out certain cases based on specific activity sequences and time conditions. Hmm, let's break down the requirements.

First, the main task is to exclude cases where the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' followed by 'Confirm Order' occurs consecutively, and the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. The final result should include all events except those from such cases.

So, the plan is: identify those problematic case_ids and then exclude their events. Let's think about how to detect the sequence.

To find consecutive sequences, I need to look for events in a case where the next event is the next activity. So for each event in the case, check if the current activity is the first in the sequence, the next is the second, and the one after that is the third. Also, ensure there are no other events in between them.

But wait, in the log, events are ordered by timestamp. So, for each case, the events are ordered by timestamp. We need to check for three consecutive events in that order with no other events in between.

So for a given case, if there's a triplet of events e1, e2, e3 where e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', e2.activity = 'Create Order', e3.activity = 'Confirm Order', and e1 is immediately followed by e2, and e2 is immediately followed by e3. Also, the time between e2 and e3 is more than 5 days.

But how do we check that there are no events in between? Because in the same case, the events are ordered by timestamp. So the row numbers can help here. For each event in the case, assign a row number ordered by timestamp. Then, check if for e1, the next row_number is e2's row_number (i.e., e1.row_num +1 = e2.row_num), and similarly for e2 to e3.

So, the approach would be:

1. For each case, assign row numbers to events ordered by timestamp. Let's call this row_num.

2. Find all triples (e1, e2, e3) where:
   - e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   - e2.activity = 'Create Order'
   - e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
   - e1.row_num +1 = e2.row_num
   - e2.row_num +1 = e3.row_num

3. Additionally, check that the time difference between e3.timestamp and e2.timestamp is more than 5 days.

Once we have these case_ids, we need to exclude all events from these cases in the final result.

So the steps in SQL would be:

- Identify the problematic case_ids using a subquery or CTE.
- Then, select all events from event_log where case_id is not in those problematic case_ids.

But how to structure the subquery/CTE to find the problematic case_ids?

Let's think about the subquery. For each case, look for the existence of such a triplet.

First, create a CTE that assigns row numbers per case:

WITH row_numbers AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)

Then, for each row in row_numbers where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check if the next row is 'Create Order' and the one after is 'Confirm Order', with consecutive row numbers.

So, for each e1 in row_numbers where e1.activity = 'Approve...', we can look for e2 in the same case where e2.rn = e1.rn +1 and e2.activity = 'Create Order'. Then, check if e3 exists in the same case with e3.rn = e2.rn +1 and e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'.

But how to do this efficiently in SQL? Maybe using self-joins.

Alternatively, we can use LAG and LEAD functions. Wait, but LAG would look at previous events, LEAD at next. But since the sequence is three events in a row, maybe using multiple window functions.

Alternatively, for each event, check if it's the first of the sequence, and the next two events form the rest of the sequence.

So, for each e1 in the row_numbers CTE where e1.activity is 'Approve...', check if the next row (e2) is 'Create Order' and the row after that (e3) is 'Confirm Order', and that e2 and e3 are consecutive.

But how to get e2 and e3 for each e1?

Perhaps using a subquery that for each e1, checks if there exists an e2 and e3 in the same case with the required activities and row numbers.

So, the subquery to find the problematic case_ids could be:

SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
FROM row_numbers e1
JOIN row_numbers e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.rn = e1.rn +1
JOIN row_numbers e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.rn = e2.rn +1
WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
  AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY;

This would get the case_ids where such a triplet exists. Then, the final query is to select all events where case_id is not in this list.

But wait, the NOT IN would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problematic_cases);

Putting it all together:

WITH row_numbers AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
problematic_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
    FROM row_numbers e1
    INNER JOIN row_numbers e2 
        ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id 
        AND e2.rn = e1.rn +1
    INNER JOIN row_numbers e3 
        ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id 
        AND e3.rn = e2.rn +1
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problematic_cases);

But wait, in DuckDB, the syntax for interval might be different. In DuckDB, the interval is written as INTERVAL '5 DAY', so '5 DAY' as a string.

Yes, so (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY would be correct.

This should work. Let's test some cases.

Suppose a case has the three events in order, consecutive, and the time between Create and Confirm is 6 days. Then, this case would be in problematic_cases, so it's excluded. All events of this case are not in the final result.

If a case has the three events but the time between Create and Confirm is 3 days, then it's not in problematic_cases, so their events are included.

If a case has the three events but there's another event between Approve and Create, then e1.rn +1 would not be e2.rn, so the join would not find it, so it's not excluded.

If a case has the three events but not consecutive, same as above.

So this query should correctly identify the problematic cases and exclude them.

Therefore, the final query is as written above.
