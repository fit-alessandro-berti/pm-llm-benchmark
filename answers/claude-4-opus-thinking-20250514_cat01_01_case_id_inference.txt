Looking at this interleaved sequence, I can identify three distinct patient cases based on the logical flow of activities, patient demographics, and departmental pathways:

## Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER Leg Injury)
- **Events:** 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- **Journey:** Register (ER)  Triage  X-ray (left leg)  Doctor consultation (hairline fracture diagnosis)  Discharge
- **Timeline:** 08:05:13 - 08:30:05
- **Key indicators:** Consistent age/gender, ER pathway, logical progression for trauma case

## Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER Infection)
- **Events:** 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- **Journey:** Register (ER)  Triage  Lab test requested  Lab completed  Doctor consultation (minor infection diagnosis)  Prescription (antibiotics)  Discharge
- **Timeline:** 08:07:02 - 08:35:29
- **Key indicators:** Consistent age/gender, ER pathway with lab work, infection treatment flow

## Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Scheduled Surgery)
- **Events:** 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
- **Journey:** Register (Surgery)  Doctor consultation (scheduled knee surgery)  Surgery prep  Surgery performed (arthroscopy)  Recovery room  Discharge
- **Timeline:** 08:07:15 - 08:40:13
- **Key indicators:** Consistent age/gender, Surgery department throughout, scheduled procedure flow

**Reasoning:**
- Each case maintains consistent patient demographics throughout
- The activity sequences follow logical hospital workflows
- Department transitions make sense (e.g., ER  Radiology  back to ER)
- Timing is sequential within each case
- Resources and additional information align with expected patterns for each type of case
