### Analysis of Temporal Profile Model for Insurance Claim Handling Process

#### 1. Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model
Based on the provided temporal profile model, several anomalies in the time intervals between activities in the insurance claim handling process have been identified:

- **Receive to Approve (R to P):** The average time between receiving a claim and approving it is approximately 25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation of 1 hour. This suggests a rigid or potentially artificial timing pattern that may not align with realistic business processes requiring thorough evaluation.
- **Approve to Notify (P to N):** There is a significant average delay of 7 days between approval and notification, with a high standard deviation of 2 days. This indicates inconsistent timing, with some notifications being heavily delayed while others occur much sooner.
- **Assign to Close (A to C):** The average time of 2 hours between assigning an adjuster and closing a claim is surprisingly short, with a standard deviation of 1 hour. This raises concerns about whether intermediate steps like evaluation or approval are being skipped or if claims are being closed prematurely.
- **Evaluate to Notify (E to N):** The average time between evaluation and notification is only 5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1 minute. This extremely short duration may indicate automated processes or potential skipping of necessary review steps before notifying the customer.

#### 2. Hypotheses on Causes of Anomalies
Several potential reasons could explain these anomalies in the temporal profile:

- **Receive to Approve (R to P) - Low Variability and Short Duration:** The rigid timing and low standard deviation might suggest an automated or pre-scheduled approval process for certain claims, bypassing thorough evaluation. Alternatively, it could indicate data entry errors where timestamps are not accurately recorded.
- **Approve to Notify (P to N) - Long Delay and High Variability:** The extended delay and high variability could be due to resource constraints, such as insufficient staff to handle notifications promptly, leading to backlogs. It might also reflect varying notification methods (e.g., manual vs. automated) or delays in customer response or confirmation.
- **Assign to Close (A to C) - Short Duration:** The quick closure after assignment might indicate that some claims are being closed without proper processing, possibly due to policy cancellations, customer withdrawals, or administrative errors. It could also suggest that certain adjusters or regions follow non-standard practices.
- **Evaluate to Notify (E to N) - Extremely Short Duration:** The very short time between evaluation and notification might be due to automated systems triggering notifications immediately after evaluation without human oversight. Alternatively, it could indicate that evaluation and notification are recorded as a single event in some cases, skewing the data.

#### 3. Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries
To investigate these anomalies further, the following SQL queries are proposed to analyze the data in the `claim_events` table and correlate timing deviations with other factors such as adjusters, claim types, or regions. These queries assume the use of PostgreSQL and are designed to identify specific claims or patterns contributing to the anomalies.

##### a. Investigating Receive to Approve (R to P) - Short Duration and Low Variability
This query identifies claims where the time between Receive (R) and Approve (P) is significantly shorter or longer than the average of 25 hours (90000 seconds), using a threshold of ±1 standard deviation (3600 seconds).

```sql
WITH r_to_p_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS receive_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    rtp.claim_id,
    rtp.time_diff_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    c.customer_id,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    a.region
FROM r_to_p_times rtp
JOIN claims c ON rtp.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON rtp.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::text
WHERE rtp.time_diff_seconds < (90000 - 3600) OR rtp.time_diff_seconds > (90000 + 3600)
ORDER BY rtp.time_diff_seconds;
```

**Purpose:** This query helps identify claims with unusual R-to-P timing and correlates them with claim type, adjuster, and region to check for patterns (e.g., specific adjusters or regions approving claims too quickly).

##### b. Investigating Approve to Notify (P to N) - Long Delay and High Variability
This query identifies claims where the time between Approve (P) and Notify (N) is outside the expected range of 7 days (604800 seconds) ± 2 days (172800 seconds).

```sql
WITH p_to_n_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    ptn.claim_id,
    ptn.time_diff_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    c.customer_id,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    a.region
FROM p_to_n_times ptn
JOIN claims c ON ptn.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON ptn.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::text
WHERE ptn.time_diff_seconds < (604800 - 172800) OR ptn.time_diff_seconds > (604800 + 172800)
ORDER BY ptn.time_diff_seconds DESC;
```

**Purpose:** This query targets claims with extreme delays or unusually quick notifications after approval, allowing analysis of whether delays are linked to specific claim types, adjusters, or regions.

##### c. Investigating Assign to Close (A to C) - Short Duration
This query identifies claims where the time between Assign (A) and Close (C) is shorter than the average of 2 hours (7200 seconds) minus 1 standard deviation (3600 seconds), and checks if intermediate activities (like Evaluate or Approve) are missing.

```sql
WITH a_to_c_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
),
missing_steps AS (
    SELECT 
        act.claim_id,
        BOOL_AND(CASE WHEN activity IN ('E', 'P') THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END) AS has_intermediate_steps
    FROM claim_events act
    WHERE act.activity IN ('E', 'P')
    GROUP BY act.claim_id
)
SELECT 
    atc.claim_id,
    atc.time_diff_seconds,
    COALESCE(ms.has_intermediate_steps, FALSE) AS has_intermediate_steps,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    a.region
FROM a_to_c_times atc
JOIN claims c ON atc.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON atc.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::text
LEFT JOIN missing_steps ms ON atc.claim_id = ms.claim_id
WHERE atc.time_diff_seconds < (7200 - 3600)
ORDER BY atc.time_diff_seconds;
```

**Purpose:** This query flags claims closed unusually quickly after assignment and checks for missing intermediate steps, correlating with adjuster and region to identify potential procedural deviations.

##### d. Investigating Evaluate to Notify (E to N) - Extremely Short Duration
This query identifies claims where the time between Evaluate (E) and Notify (N) is shorter than the average of 5 minutes (300 seconds) minus 1 standard deviation (60 seconds).

```sql
WITH e_to_n_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    etn.claim_id,
    etn.time_diff_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    a.region
FROM e_to_n_times etn
JOIN claims c ON etn.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON etn.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::text
WHERE etn.time_diff_seconds < (300 - 60)
ORDER BY etn.time_diff_seconds;
```

**Purpose:** This query highlights claims with suspiciously quick transitions from evaluation to notification, checking for correlations with claim type or adjuster to determine if automation or data entry practices are involved.

#### Conclusion
These SQL queries provide a structured approach to verify the identified anomalies in the temporal profile model by extracting specific claims with unusual timing patterns and correlating them with relevant factors such as adjusters, regions, and claim types. The results can help uncover systemic issues, procedural deviations, or data quality problems contributing to the observed irregularities in the insurance claim handling process.
