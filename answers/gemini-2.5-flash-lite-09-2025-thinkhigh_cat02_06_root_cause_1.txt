This analysis focuses on calculating the total resolution time for each ticket and then dissecting the wait times between critical process steps to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

## 1. Identification of Significantly Longer Cases

To identify significant delays, we first calculate the Total Resolution Time (TRT) for each case, defined as the time elapsed between **Receive Ticket** and **Close Ticket**.

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Resolution Time (TRT) |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00 | 2024-03-01 10:15 | 2 hours, 15 minutes |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10 | 2024-03-01 09:30 | 1 hour, 20 minutes |
| **102** | 2024-03-01 08:05 | 2024-03-02 09:15 | **~25 hours, 10 minutes** |
| **104** | 2024-03-01 08:20 | 2024-03-02 08:30 | **~24 hours, 10 minutes** |
| **105** | 2024-03-01 08:25 | 2024-03-03 09:30 | **~50 hours, 5 minutes** |

The average resolution time for the quick cases (101 and 103) is approximately **1 hour and 47 minutes**.

**Conclusion:** Cases **102, 104, and 105** are significantly delayed, taking over 13 times longer than the average ticket resolution time.

## 2. Determination of Potential Root Causes

We analyze the wait times (gaps between sequential activities) for the delayed cases to isolate the factors contributing to the long cycle times.

### Factor A: Delays Related to Escalation Handoff (Cases 102 & 105)

When a ticket requires escalation, the subsequent handling time is critical.

| Case | Activity A (Start) | Activity B (End) | Wait Time | Observation |
|------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **102** | Escalate to L2 @ 11:30 | Investigate (L2) @ 14:00 | **2.5 hours** | Moderate delay for L2 team pick-up. |
| **105** | Escalate to L2 @ 10:00 (Day 1) | Investigate (L2) @ 14:00 (Day 2) | **28 hours** | **Critical Delay:** The escalated ticket sat untouched for over a full day before L2 began investigation. |

**Root Cause Finding:** Case 105 shows a massive bottleneck in the L2 queue or handoff process. The escalation itself took immediate effect in the log, but the actual work by the specialized team was severely delayed.

### Factor B: Extended Overnight/Off-Hours Stagnation (Cases 102, 104, 105)

A common pattern across all long cases (even the non-escalated one) is a massive time gap occurring between the `Investigate Issue` step and the `Resolve Ticket` step, often spanning an entire night.

| Case | Investigation End Time | Resolution Start Time | Wait Time | Observation |
|------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **102** | 2024-03-01 14:00 | 2024-03-02 09:00 | **19 hours** | Investigation complete, ticket sat until next morning before resolution was applied. |
| **104** | 2024-03-01 13:00 | 2024-03-02 08:00 | **19 hours** | Investigation complete, ticket sat until next morning before resolution was applied. |
| **105** | 2024-03-02 14:00 | 2024-03-03 09:00 | **19 hours** | Investigation complete, ticket sat until next morning before resolution was applied. |

**Root Cause Finding:** It appears that if an investigation spans late into the day, the final resolution step is explicitly or implicitly scheduled for the next business morning, leading to predictable 18-19 hour stalls.

### Factor C: Pre-Investigation Delays (Case 104)

Case 104 did not escalate but was still slow. We examine the time between assignment and investigation start:

| Case | Activity A (Start) | Activity B (End) | Wait Time | Observation |
|------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **104** | Assign L1 @ 09:30 | Investigate @ 13:00 | **3.5 hours** | Agent has the ticket but does not start working on it for 3.5 hours. |

**Root Cause Finding:** Case 104 suggests L1 agent availability or a general backlog preventing work from starting promptly after assignment, even for standard tickets.

## 3. Insights and Recommendations

The analysis reveals that the primary performance bottlenecks are **queueing time for specialized resources (L2)** and **scheduling constraints related to resolution logging (Overnight Stalls)**.

### Insights:

1.  **Escalation Bottleneck is Severe (Case 105):** The 28-hour gap between escalation logging and L2 investigation starting suggests that either L2 agents are not monitored overnight, or there is a major administrative delay in recognizing or routing escalated tickets to the correct L2 queue.
2.  **Resolution Dependency on Business Hours:** The consistent 19-hour overnight gap after investigation completion suggests that the final `Resolve Ticket` step is treated as a non-urgent, daylight-only activity, even if the investigation concluded late in the afternoon.
3.  **L1 Handling Efficiency (Case 104):** The 3.5-hour delay before L1 investigation began indicates that the assignment step might not correlate directly with immediate agent bandwidth.

### Recommendations:

| Bottleneck Addressed | Recommendation | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L2 Queueing/Handoff (Case 105)** | **Implement Priority Alerting for Escalations:** Ensure that once an `Escalate` event is logged, the Level-2 team receives an immediate, high-priority notification (e.g., PagerDuty/SMS) rather than relying on passive queue monitoring. Investigate why L2 work didn't begin until the next calendar day. | Drastically reduce the cycle time for complex tickets. |
| **Overnight Stalls (Cases 102, 104, 105)** | **Decouple Investigation from Resolution:** If investigation is complete, the system should flag the ticket as "Ready for Finalization." If resolutions can be scripted or performed by an on-call/L1 agent quickly, resolve this gap. If resolution requires deep domain knowledge, staff L2 teams to handle ticket finalization shifts outside of peak hours. | Capture the 19 hours of lost time, potentially reducing TRT by 30-50%. |
| **L1 Pre-Investigation Delay (Case 104)** | **Audit L1 Workload Distribution:** Analyze the time between `Assign to Level-1 Agent` and `Investigate Issue`. If agents are assigned more tickets than they can start immediately, adjust assignment logic or allocate dedicated capacity buffers. | Improve responsiveness for initial support tiers. |
