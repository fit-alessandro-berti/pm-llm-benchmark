### Rationale for Added Constraints

1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**  
   These activities must always appear in the process, ensuring that sensitive decisions undergo a fairness-related check.

2. **Coexistence of `ManualReview` with sensitive decisions:**  
   For any decision targeting minority applicants (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`, etc.), we enforce that `ManualReview` also appears somewhere in the trace. This guarantees manual oversight to reduce bias.

3. **Response from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`:**  
   This requires that after the sensitive attribute check (`CheckApplicantRace`), the process must respond with a bias mitigation step before any decision-making, preventing decisions that are based solely on sensitive attributes without review.

4. **Succession from `BiasMitigationCheck` to sensitive decisions:**  
   Ensures that decisions regarding sensitive groups happen only after a bias mitigation has occurred, promoting fairness and preventing premature biased outcomes.

5. **Nonsuccession from `CheckApplicantRace` to decisions:**  
   Prevents direct immediate succession from sensitive attribute checks to decisions such as `Reject` or `Approve`. This avoids decisions that could directly discriminate without intermediate evaluation.

Together, these constraints shape the loan application process model to enforce fairness, ensuring that sensitive attributes do not lead directly to biased decisions and that manual and bias mitigation reviews are integral steps.
