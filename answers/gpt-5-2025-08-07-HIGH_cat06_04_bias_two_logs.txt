Short answer: The Group B (Unprotected) log exhibits a favorable bias via a “Community Boost” that is not available to Group A (Protected). This advantage is tied to LocalResident = TRUE and membership in a specific CommunityGroup, leading to lower effective approval thresholds for that subgroup and systematically different outcomes.

What the logs show
- Group A (Protected):
  - LocalResident = FALSE for all cases; CommunityGroup = None.
  - ScoreAdjustment = 0 in every case.
  - Outcomes align with raw PreliminaryScore (P001 720 Approved; P002 710 Rejected; P003 740 Approved).

- Group B (Unprotected):
  - LocalResident = TRUE for all cases.
  - When CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club,” a +10 ScoreAdjustment (“Community Boost”) is applied at PreliminaryScoring and carried through ManualReview to FinalDecision (U001, U003).
  - No boost when CommunityGroup = None (U002).
  - The boost alters outcomes: U003 with a lower base score (695) becomes 705 (Adjusted) and is Approved, whereas a higher unboosted case in Group A (P002 at 710) was Rejected.

How the bias manifests
- Disparate treatment: The decision process explicitly adds points based on CommunityGroup membership. That is a non-performance factor directly influencing the score and final decision.
- Proxy/gating via LocalResident: All boosted cases are LocalResident = TRUE, and all Group A cases are LocalResident = FALSE. If LocalResident status is a precondition or strong correlate of being in the community group, the boost is effectively unavailable to Group A.
- Lower effective threshold for favored subgroup: The +10 makes borderline applicants in Group B pass where similarly or better-scored Group A applicants do not (e.g., U003 695705 Approved vs P002 710 Rejected). Even though this sample yields equal approval rates (2/3 each), the rule systematically advantages LocalResidents with the specified CommunityGroup, which would increase approvals for that subgroup at scale.

Conclusion
- The bias is visible in the Group B log as a “Community Boost” tied to LocalResident and CommunityGroup, creating a preferential pathway. Because Group A never receives such adjustments, they face a stricter effective standard, leading to systematic differences in final decisions.
