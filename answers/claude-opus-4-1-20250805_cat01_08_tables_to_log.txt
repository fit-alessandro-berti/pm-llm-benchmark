I'll create a comprehensive event log by integrating all the provided tables. Let me analyze the data and construct the event log with proper chronological ordering.

## Event Log

## Assumptions Made:

1. **Resource Mapping**: Used the Resources table to map IDs to actual names for better readability
2. **Missing Data**: Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment records - this represents an incomplete order process
3. **Multiple Shipments**: Order 1002 has two separate deliveries (DLV-5002 and DLV-5003), likely due to partial backorder as noted
4. **Multiple Invoices**: Order 1002 has two invoices (INV-1002 and INV-1003), possibly due to the split shipments
5. **Payment Resource**: Payment events don't have a specific resource/actor, as payments are typically system-recorded
6. **Chronological Order**: All events are sorted by timestamp within each case to maintain process flow integrity
7. **Item Picking**: Each item picked is recorded as a separate event to maintain granularity for process mining

## Key Insights:
- The event log shows complete order-to-cash cycles for orders 1001, 1002, 1003, and 1005
- Order 1004 appears to be incomplete (picked but not shipped/invoiced)
- Order 1002 demonstrates a complex case with multiple shipments and invoices
- High priority orders (1001, 1003, 1005) generally show faster processing times
