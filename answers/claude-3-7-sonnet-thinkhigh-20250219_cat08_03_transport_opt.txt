# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels Delivery Operations

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

To create a cohesive event log from Speedy Parcels' multiple data sources, I recommend the following approach:

**Integration Strategy:**
- Use the "Vehicle-Day" (e.g., V12-20241205) as the primary case identifier to track complete operational days
- Establish a secondary case concept linking package-specific events within each vehicle-day
- Merge events chronologically with normalized timestamps across all systems
- Create a unified data schema with standardized activity names and attributes

**Key Integration Challenges:**
- **Temporal misalignment:** GPS readings (high frequency) versus scanner events (discrete)
- **Spatial correlation:** Determining when a vehicle is "at customer location" based on proximity rules
- **Activity inference:** Reconstructing missing events (e.g., GPS may show a vehicle stopped, but no scanner event exists)
- **Attribute completeness:** Scanner events have package details while GPS events have location/speed but may lack package information
- **Data quality issues:** Human error in scanner usage, GPS signal drops, or dispatch system inaccuracies

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1. Standardize timestamps and location formats across all systems
2. Implement proximity-based rules to associate GPS coordinates with known locations (depot, customer addresses)
3. Apply noise filtering to GPS data to remove insignificant movements
4. Enrich events with contextual data (e.g., add traffic conditions, weather data)
5. Create derived events where needed (e.g., infer "searching for parking" from movement patterns)

### Process Discovery

To visualize the actual delivery process:

1. **Apply Discovery Techniques:**
   - Initial exploration with Directly-Follows Graphs to understand the basic process flow
   - Use Inductive Miner for a structured process model that handles noise and infrequent paths
   - Apply Fuzzy Miner to handle the high variability in delivery processes
   - Create hierarchical process models with different abstraction levels (high-level route overview  detailed delivery activities)

2. **Specialized Discovery Approaches:**
   - Develop geo-process mining visualizations showing processes on maps
   - Create time-based process animations showing vehicle movements throughout the day
   - Apply trace clustering to identify common delivery patterns and route variants
   - Generate separate models for different process aspects (delivery execution, vehicle movement, driver activities)

### Conformance Checking

To compare actual delivery executions with planned routes:

1. **Reference Model Creation:**
   - Extract planned routes from the dispatch system as reference process models
   - Define expected sequences, timing, and locations for each vehicle-day

2. **Deviation Analysis:**
   - Calculate alignment between actual and planned processes using token replay or cost-based alignment
   - Identify key deviations:
     * **Sequence deviations:** Deliveries performed in different order than planned
     * **Skipped activities:** Planned stops never visited
     * **Added activities:** Unplanned stops (maintenance, breaks, detours)
     * **Timing deviations:** Significant differences between planned and actual durations
     * **Route deviations:** Taking different roads than planned
     * **Spatial deviations:** Locations visited outside expected coordinates

3. **Visualization and Metrics:**
   - Overlay actual versus planned routes on maps highlighting deviations
   - Calculate conformance metrics (fitness, precision) for each vehicle-day
   - Classify deviations by type, frequency, and impact on delivery performance

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Delivery Performance KPIs:**

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Intelligent Dynamic Routing with Real-Time Adaptation

**Target Inefficiency:** Suboptimal static routes failing to account for real-world conditions, leading to excessive travel time and fuel consumption.

**Root Cause Addressed:** Inadequate consideration of historical performance data and real-time traffic conditions in route planning.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement machine learning-based route optimization that incorporates:
  * Historical performance data from process mining (actual travel times between locations)
  * Real-time traffic data
  * Weather conditions
  * Driver-specific performance patterns
- Develop a dynamic re-routing capability that can adjust routes mid-shift when conditions change
- Create driver-accessible mobile interface showing optimized routes with alternatives

**Process Mining Support:**

- Improve on-time delivery rate by 15%
- Reduce overtime hours by 10-12%
- Enhance driver satisfaction through more realistic routes

### Strategy 2: Proactive Delivery Failure Prevention System

**Target Inefficiency:** High rate of failed delivery attempts (customer not home) causing wasted time, extra fuel, and redelivery costs.

**Root Cause Addressed:** Inadequate customer communication and inflexible delivery windows.

- Improve customer satisfaction scores by 25%
- Reduce fuel consumption by 5-7% through fewer return trips

### Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance and Vehicle Optimization

**Target Inefficiency:** Unexpected vehicle breakdowns and suboptimal vehicle-to-route assignments causing service disruptions and increased costs.

**Root Cause Addressed:** Reactive maintenance approach and failure to match vehicle capabilities to route requirements.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Develop a predictive maintenance system that:
  * Uses process mining to identify early warning signs of potential breakdowns
  * Schedules preventive maintenance based on actual usage patterns rather than fixed intervals
  * Optimizes maintenance timing to minimize operational disruption
- Implement intelligent vehicle-to-route assignment that:
  * Matches vehicle capabilities (size, fuel efficiency, condition) to specific route requirements
  * Rotates vehicles strategically to balance wear across the fleet
  * Considers historical vehicle performance on different route types

**Process Mining Support:**

- Performance analysis showed certain vehicles consistently underperform on specific route types
- Conformance checking identified significant deviations caused by unscheduled maintenance stops
- Impact analysis quantified the cascading effect of vehicle breakdowns, with each incident causing an average 3-hour operational disruption

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce unscheduled maintenance events by 65%
- Decrease vehicle downtime by 40%
- Optimize vehicle-route matching for 7-10% improved fuel efficiency
- Extend average vehicle lifespan by 15-20%
- Reduce maintenance costs by 15-18% through condition-based scheduling
