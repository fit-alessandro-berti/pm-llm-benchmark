Sure, I can generate an example of a Log Skeleton for a Purchase-to-Pay process. Here's a simplified version that follows the structure you described:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Request for Quotation')},
    'always_before': {('Receive Goods', 'Create Purchase Order'), ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'), ('Payment', 'Invoice Receipt')},
    'always_after': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'), ('Invoice Receipt', 'Receive Goods'), ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment')},
    'never_together': {('Invoice Receipt', 'Create Purchase Order')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {1},
        'Receive Goods': {1},
        'Invoice Receipt': {1},
        'Payment': {1},
        'Request for Quotation': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'),
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'),
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment')
    }
}
```

Let me explain the constraints based on standard purchase-to-pay process activities:

1. Equivalence: A create purchase order (`Create Purchase Order`) can often be followed by a request for quotation (`Request for Quotation`). Since they depend on the same purchase request, we indicate that 'Create Purchase Order' and 'Request for Quotation' are considered to have the same occurrences.

2. Always Before: 
   - `Receive Goods` cannot occur before creating a `Create Purchase Order`.
   - `Invoice Receipt` should happen after `Receive Goods` to ensure that the goods have been received before invoicing.
   - `Payment` has to be executed after `Invoice Receipt` to ensure that the invoice is validated before a payment is made.

3. Always After:
   - After `Create Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods` should be processed once the order is fulfilled.
   - `Invoice Receipt` should follow `Receive Goods`, indicating that after goods are received, they should be invoiced.
   - `Payment` must occur after `Invoice Receipt`, aligning with accounting practices.

4. Never Together: An `Invoice Receipt` and a `Create Purchase Order` cannot occur together in the same case since an invoice is created for received goods and not during the purchase order creation.

5. Activity Occurrences: We set the frequency of `Create Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods`, `Invoice Receipt`, and
