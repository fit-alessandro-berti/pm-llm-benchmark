**Redesigned Pseudo-BPMN Process with Optimizations**

The redesigned process focuses on automating routine tasks, leveraging automation to optimize resource allocation, and incorporating predictive analytics to proactively identify potential customization requests.

**Changes to Existing Tasks:**

1. **Task A: Receive Customer Request**
	* Implement an AI-powered chatbot to handle a significant portion of incoming requests, reducing the need for manual intervention.
	* Automate data entry for standard requests, using machine learning algorithms to learn and improve data accuracy over time.
2. **Task B1 & B2: Standard & Custom Feasibility Analysis**
	* Develop a rules-based system to determine the likelihood of a request requiring customization, using historical data and machine learning models.
	* Introduce a hybrid approach, where both standard and custom tasks are executed in parallel, with the decision on which path to take based on the predictive analysis results.
3. **Task E1 & E2: Custom Quotation & Rejection Notice**
	* Introduce a module for proactively identifying potential non-standard requests, using predictive analytics and data mining techniques.
	* Automate the generation of customized quotations and rejection notices, using template-based solutions and AI-powered content creation.
4. **Task F: Obtain Manager Approval**
	* Implement a digital workflow for manager approval, using a dashboard to track approval status and notify stakeholders.
	* Introduce a self-service portal for managers to review and approve requests, reducing the need for manual intervention.
5. **Task G: Generate Final Invoice**
	* Develop a template-based system for generating invoices, using AI-powered content creation and machine learning algorithms to optimize pricing and discounts.
	* Automate the process of updating customer records and invoice status, using data synchronization and workflow automation tools.

**New Decision Gateways and Subprocesses:**

1. **Predictive Analysis Gateway**: A new gateway that evaluates the likelihood of a request requiring customization, using machine learning models and historical data.
	* If the analysis indicates a high likelihood of customization, the process flows through the custom path.
	* If the analysis indicates a low likelihood, the process flows through the standard path.
2. **Dynamic Resource Allocation Gateway**: A new gateway that dynamically allocates resources based on the type of request and the availability of resources.
	* If a non-standard request is identified, the gateway allocates additional resources to handle the customized request.
	* If a standard request is identified, the gateway optimizes resource allocation based on historical data and demand forecasting.
3. **Automated Workflows**: New subprocesses that automate routine tasks, such as data entry, invoice generation, and customer record updates.
4. **Intelligent Routing**: A new subprocess that uses machine learning algorithms to route requests to the most suitable task handler based on historical data and customer behavior.

**Effects on Performance, Customer Satisfaction, and Operational Complexity:**

1. **Reduced Turnaround Times**: Automation and predictive analytics enable faster processing of requests, reducing turnaround times and improving customer satisfaction.
2. **Increased Flexibility**: The redesigned process allows for greater flexibility in handling non-standard requests, enabling the company to respond more effectively to changing customer needs.
3. **Operational Complexity Reduction**: The introduction of automated workflows and intelligent routing reduces the complexity of the process, making it easier to manage and maintain.
4. **Improved Customer Experience**: The use of AI-powered chatbots, digital workflows, and predictive analytics enables a more personalized and efficient experience for customers, improving overall satisfaction.

**Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning:**

1. **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends in request processing, customer behavior, and resource allocation.
2. **Machine Learning Model Development**: Develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of customization, optimize resource allocation, and identify potential issues in the process.
3. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**: Continuously monitor the process and refine the predictive models and machine learning algorithms to improve performance and accuracy.

By implementing these changes, the redesigned process is expected to improve performance, customer satisfaction, and operational complexity, while reducing turnaround times and increasing flexibility in handling non-standard requests.
