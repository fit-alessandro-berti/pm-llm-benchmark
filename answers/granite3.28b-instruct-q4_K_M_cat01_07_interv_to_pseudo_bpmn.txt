[End Event]
```

**Roles and Artifacts:**
- **Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk):** Checks PO, logs invoices, forwards to Purchasing, handles discrepancies.
- **Dan (Purchasing Officer):** Confirms receipt and match with PO. Resolves discrepancies, sends confirmation back to AP.
- **Carlos (Department Manager):** Receives invoices for final approval after confirmation from Purchasing.
- **Rita (Accounts Payable Supervisor):** Handles exceptions; contacts suppliers or department heads as needed.
- **Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager):** Involved indirectly, helps resolve issues with suppliers regarding invoice terms.

**Artifacts:**
- Purchase Orders (POs)
- Invoices
- Email communications for clarification and confirmation

**Exceptions/Variations:**
- Invoice without a valid PO Number -> Send back to supplier for details or hold until PO is provided.
- Discrepancies in invoice details (pricing, quantities) -> Hold the invoice and contact either Purchasing or Supplier to resolve.
- Unmatched Invoices (services contracted informally) -> Create retrospective PO or decide on rejection after consultation with department heads.
