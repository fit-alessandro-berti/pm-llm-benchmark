### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

**Process Mining Techniques and Analysis:**
To formally identify and quantify the impact of each type of instance-spanning constraint, we use process mining techniques. Process mining allows us to reconstruct accurate process models from event logs. Here's how each constraint can be analyzed:

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:**
  - Use resource perspective analysis to identify how often orders are waiting for Cold-Packing stations.
  - Metric: Average waiting time and queue length at Cold-Packing stations.

- **Shipping Batches:**
  - Sequence analysis to understand the delay incurred due to batching.
  - Metric: Average time orders spend waiting for batch formation.

- **Priority Handling for Express Orders:**
  - Compare the processing time and delays experienced by standard orders when express orders intervene.
  - Metric: Proportion of delays to standard orders due to express processing.

- **Hazardous Material Limits:**
  - Analyze throughput where hazardous orders are involved.
  - Metric: Incidence and duration of blocked operations due to regulation limits.

**Differentiating Between Within-Instance and Between-Instance Factors:**
- Within-Instance: Measure actual time taken for each activity from start to end for each order.
- Between-Instance: Use process models and heatmaps to visualize waiting times specifically linked to resource contention or batching delays.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

**Potential Interactions:**
- **Priority Handling and Cold-Packing:**
  Express orders need Cold-Packing can lead to increased queue delays for standard orders needing the same resource.

- **Batching and Hazardous Material Limits:**
  If several hazardous orders are directed to the same region, batching might be delayed, affecting throughput.

Understanding these interactions is crucial because identifying overlapping and compounding effects of constraints can help in designing holistic optimization strategies, rather than addressing constraints in isolation.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Stations**
- **Addresses:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations.
- **Changes:** Implement a dynamic scheduling system that reallocates resources based on real-time demand predictions.
- **Leveraging Data:** Use historical data for demand forecasting.
- **Outcomes:** Reduce queue lengths and waiting times, improving overall throughput, especially during peak periods.

**Strategy 2: Revised Batching Logic**
- **Addresses:** Shipping Batches.
- **Changes:** Introduce dynamic batch formation based on real-time shipment volumes and regional demand rather than fixed processes.
- **Leveraging Data:** Analyze historical patterns in order destinations.
- **Outcomes:** Decrease in waiting times for batch formation; more efficient delivery routing.

**Strategy 3: Improved Scheduling with Priority and Regulatory Compliance**
- **Addresses:** Priority Handling, Hazardous Material Limits.
- **Changes:** Implement a rule-based scheduler that accounts for both order priorities and compliance constraints.
- **Leveraging Data:** Real-time monitoring and predictive analytics.
- **Outcomes:** Balance faster processing for express orders while maintaining compliance without unduly delaying standard orders.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

**Simulation Techniques:**
- **Approach:** Utilize discrete-event simulation models built from the process mining analysis to test proposed strategies.
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Simulate scenarios with peak demand to assess resource contention.
  - Evaluate how dynamic batching affects logistics.
  - Check if priority rules cause bottlenecks under mixed order types.

**Validation of KPIs:**
- Use simulations to assess performance improvements (e.g., reduced cycle time, increased throughput) while respecting constraints such as regulatory limits.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Key Metrics and Dashboards:**
- **Metrics:** Monitor queue lengths for resources, batch formation time, order throughput, and compliance metrics.
- **Process Mining Dashboards:**
  - Real-time queue status for Cold-Packing stations.
  - Visualization of batching efficiency by region.
  - Compliance dashboard showing orders in packing or quality check stages involving hazardous materials.

**Tracking Effectiveness:**
- Use dashboards to track actual performance against critical KPIs—such as reduced waiting times, balanced resource utilization between order types, and compliance adherence—allowing for continuous improvement.

This strategic plan recognizes the complexities of inter-instance dependencies and leverages data-driven insights to optimize operations effectively. By implementing and continuously refining these strategies, the fulfillment center can enhance its ability to meet delivery deadlines and improve overall customer satisfaction.
