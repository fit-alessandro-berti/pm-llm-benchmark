The root cause of the performance issues in the process is primarily due to the high frequency of events (i.e., objects being created or destroyed) in some of the processes. Specifically:

  * "Book Vehicles" has a frequency of 19, which means it happens quite frequently compared to other processes. However, since each event represents a large amount of time (371476.42 seconds), this process could potentially have an impact on overall performance.
  * There are two events with a high frequency in "Reschedule Container" (i.e., Reschedule Container -> Depart -> Depart and Depart -> Reschedule Container). This indicates that the processes for rescheduling containers and releasing them can be quite common and may cause congestion in certain areas of the system, particularly if there are many concurrent requests or tasks.

To optimize performance in these areas, you could consider implementing techniques such as:

  * Caching: In "Book Vehicles" or another process with high frequency events, caching some objects (e.g., containers) could help reduce the number of times they need to be created and released.
  * Data Partitioning: If "Reschedule Container" is responsible for rescheduling many containers at once, partitioning the requests by container type might help improve performance. For example, you could have a separate process or thread for each container type, with a queue that is full when it runs out of capacity.
  * Load Balancing: If there are many concurrent requests for "Book Vehicles" and "Reschedule Container", consider using load balancing techniques to distribute the workload across multiple servers or workers.

By optimizing these processes specifically (i.e., by caching them, partitioning the requests, or balancing the load), you can reduce the frequency of events and improve the overall performance of the system.
