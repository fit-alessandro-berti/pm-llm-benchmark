## Process Improvement Consultant Report: Optimizing Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions

### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To analyze TechSolve’s resource assignment behavior, I would systematically examine the event log data through both quantitative metrics derived from process mining and conceptually through process mapping informed by the event stream.

#### Key Metrics of Focus:

- **Agent-level Metrics:**  
  - **Workload Distribution:** Average number of open tickets per agent, total resolution time per agent, and first-call resolution (FCR) rate (especially L1-specific).  
  - **Activity Throughput:** Tickets handled per agent per shift, average time spent processing each ticket (including escalation delays).  

- **Tier-specific Metrics:**  
  - **Handling Time versus Escalation Time:** Time taken per ticket at each tier, time lost in escalation loops (e.g., time between escalation and assignment).  
  - **Reassignment Frequency:** Number of ticket reassignments per tier, average time between initial assignment and final assignment.  

- **Skill and Role Metrics:**  
  - Skill utilization rate for each skill (e.g., percentage of App-CRM tickets resolved by agents with App-CRM skills).  
  - Time per ticket with skill mismatch vs. matches.  

#### Process Mining Techniques:  

- **Resource Interaction Analysis:**  
  Mapping of all handovers (escalations/reassignments) to visualize the ‘who transitions to whom’ pattern. This would reveal hotspots of escalations and long handover chains—flagging where the assigned agent lacks required skills (e.g., INC-1001’s initial L1 assignment to Agent A05, who performed poorly due to missing Database-SQL).

- **Social Network Analysis (SNA):**  
  Mapping agent-to-agent handover flows to identify informal escalation networks or repeated assignments to the same agents, indicating bottlenecks or over-reliance on certain skill sets. For example, repeated assignment of Database-SQL tasks to Agent B15 despite her assignment history.

- **Role Discovery:**  
  Identifying inferred roles and handover patterns to uncover process variations—like informal L1-Agent-A02 influencing L2 assignments despite L1 responsibility. This would expose gaps in current assignment logic.

#### Comparison to Intended Logic:  
Current assignment logic is a mix of round-robin (simplicity) and manual intelligence, leading to skill mismatches (e.g., assigning a Security agent to handle App-CRM tickets lacking Security-App expertise). Mining reveals deviations from ideal patterns: manual decisions override skill-based routing, and spiral handovers violate intended retention of L1 ownership.

#### Skill Utilization Analysis:  
Process mining detects underutilization: specialized agents performing generic tasks (e.g., Agent B12, posted as App-CRM with DB-SQL tasks). Conversely, specialists are underused—indicating poor initial assignment validation, leading to escalations and wasted expertise.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

#### Potential Bottlenecks and Problems:

- **Skill Shortages Leading to Delays:**  
  High volume of L2/L3 tickets with specific required skills (e.g., App-CRM for database applications) assigned to agents lacking those skills, forcing escalation and extending resolution time. For example, INC-1001 repeatedly assigned L2 tasks with DB-SQL skills to Agent B15, a key inconsistency.

- **Excessive Reassignment & Escalations:**  
  Frequent reassignments (e.g., INC-1002 escalated 3 times within 1 hour) and prolonged escalation times signal misaligned assignments and process friction. Average latitude time per escalation can be quantified per ticket.

- **Ineffective Initial Assignments:**  
  Repeated L1 reassignments indicate poor first assignment decisions—e.g., agent Selection based on tier availability but not on skill fit, resulting in first-call failures.

- **Overloaded vs. Underutilized Agents:**  
  Some agents (e.g., Dispatcher) face heavy workloads with cleanup from reassignments, while others (e.g., Agent A02) sit idle during L1/II peak hours, suggesting poor workload balancing.

- **Correlation with SLA Breaches:**  
  Heavyweight tickets (P1-P2) assigned to low-skilled agents (by role/skill) or displaced by poor initial assignments breach SLAs more frequently. Predictive analysis could forecast SLA risk based on resource assignment patterns.

#### Quantification:  
- Average ticket delay attributable to reassignment: Calculate cumulative delay in ticket timeline between initial assignment and final resolution by performing path analysis on failure edges (escalations, reassignments).  
- SLA breach rate segmented by skill mismatch: For instance, 65% of P3 tickets causing SLA breach lacking required DB-SQL skill.  
- Agent utilization efficiency: Calculate agent team efficiency ratio (tickets resolved / total working hours) to spot underused specialists.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Root causes could include:

- **Static Assignment Logic:** Pure round-robin ignores dynamic skill demand and real-time workload, leading to skill shortages and misfits.  
- **Incomplete Skill Profiling:** Skill data inaccurate or missing critical technical nuances (e.g., distinguishing DB-SQL vs. DB-NetWorker).  
- **Poor Ticket Initialization:** Agent metadata derived from categorization (e.g., assuming App-CRM means OS-Windows), yet actual ticket content shows mismatched needs.  
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Absence of dashboards showing queue lengths per skill, tier, or workload, causing reactive rather than proactive assignment.  
- **LQA/L1 Reliance:** L1 scripts or escalation triggers override agent autonomy or skill fit due to informal influence patterns revealed via SNA.

#### Using Variant and Decision Mining:

- **Variant Analysis:** Compare cases with smooth assignment cycles (low reassignment) vs. broken cycles (many reassignments). Variants can highlight specific ticket attributes (category + keyword) leading to poor updates. For example, App-CRM tickets with security keywords may consistently go to non-Security-App agents.  
- **Decision Mining:** Apply classification models to identify attributes driving poor assignments. For instance, if ticket ‘OS-WindowsServer’ paired with ‘Troubleshoot’ is frequently assigned to App-CRM skill agents, decision mining reveals skill-irrelevant preprocessing issues—likely automated categorization bias.

### 4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

#### Strategy 1: **Skill-Weighted Routing with Confidence Scores**

- **Issue Addressed:** Skill mismatches causing escalations and extended resolution times.  
- **Implementation:** Develop an algorithm that routes tickets using a weighted scoring system:  
  Score = (matching percentage of priority + category) – (weight for ticket complexity)  
  Weighted skills are increased (e.g., DB-SQL for App-CRM tickets requires double weight). Dynamic adjustment based on agent availability and real-time workload.  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Itemized agent skill proficiency (not just presence).  
  - Historical ticket outcomes (FCR rate at each tier).  
- **Expected Benefit:** Reduction in skill mismatches by 30-40%; average ticket resolution time decreased by 20% for P3-P2 tickets.

#### Strategy 2: **Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**

- **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workloads (some agents overloaded, others idle).  
- **Implementation:** Create a dynamic algorithm that balances:  
  - Current number of open tickets per agent.  
  - Skill-specialization (matched to ticket skill requirements).  
  - Availability (shift schedule; buffer time for escalation).  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Real-time queue length per tier and task type.  
  - Workload time series for each agent (open tickets, progress, free time).  
- **Expected Benefit:** Improvement in agent utilization efficiency from ~60% to ~82%; reduction in ticket queue times by 25%.

#### Strategy 3: **Predictive Skill Matching Using Ticket Metadata**

- **Issue Addressed:** Repeated skill mismatches with high impact (e.g., DB task assigned to non-DB specialists).  
- **Implementation:** Use natural language processing (NLP) on ticket descriptions to extract keywords (e.g., “database report”, “sql query”) and route accordingly. Overlay skill profiles for predictive matching.  
- **Data Requirements:**  
  - NLP-tagged ticket descriptions.  
  - Agent skill granularity (e.g., DB-SQL, DB-Windows, DB-Net).  
- **Expected Benefit:** Reduction in skill mismatch tickets by 40%; fewer escalations due to initial mismatch avoided by 25%.

#### Additional Supportive Measure:  
- **Dynamic Tier Reassignment:** Use reinforcement learning to dynamically promote agents to higher tiers upon sustained P3+ success, earning tier-based bonuses when resolving complex L3 tickets.

- **Model:** Use discrete-event simulation (DES) tools (e.g., AnyLogic) to replicate TechSolve’s ticket flow based on current mining insights and proposed strategies.  
- **Inputs:** Agent skill profiles, historical workloads, ticket characteristics, current assignment rules.  
- **Scenarios Tested:**  
  - Baseline (current logic) vs. Skill-Weighted routing with weighted confidence.  
  - Revenue and response-time sensitivity to workload imbalances.  
- **Outputs:** Simulated metrics including SLA compliance, average resolution time, reassignment rate, and agent utilization.  
- **Validation:** Cross-check simulation outcomes with 90-day post-implementation data to update models iteratively.

#### Monitoring Post-Implementation:

- **KPIs to Track:**  
  - First-call resolution rate by tier.  
  - Average ticket resolution time (ARPT), particularly for P2-P3 tickets.  
  - Number of escalations/reassignments per ticket.  
  - Agent utilization rate.  
  - SLA compliance rate per priority and skill level.

- **Dashboards:**  
  - Real-time resource utilization dashboard visualizing agent load per skill/tier and current queue backlogs.  
  - SLA breach heatmaps by agent and ticket type.  
  - Skill-level ticket routing analysis comparing expected vs. actual assignments.  

- **Feedback Loop:**  
  Regularly update mining models with new process logs to capture long-term impact and adapt to evolving incident patterns.
