This is a process model shown as an EPC/Workflow-style graph with gateways. Activities are rounded rectangles labeled with letters and names; black dots on arcs indicate control-flow connectors.

Flow:
- Start at activity a: “register request.”
- From a, the process can branch to three examination activities:
  - b: “examine thoroughly”
  - c: “examine casually”
  - d: “check ticket”
- These feed into e: “decide.” There are feedback loops from e back to b/c/d and to f.
- f: “reinitiate request” can loop back to the earlier examinations as well as toward e.
- From e, the process splits toward two outcomes:
  - g: “pay compensation”
  - h: “reject request”
- Both converge and lead to z: “end.”

At the bottom-right, a legend explains the black-dot gateway notation:
- XOR-split and XOR-join (exclusive choice/merge)
- AND-split and AND-join (parallel fork/join)
- OR-split and OR-join (inclusive choice/merge)

Arrows show the possible paths; loops indicate rework cycles before the decision and reinitiation steps.
