To construct the corresponding POWL model for the given complex digital service provisioning process at a telecom company, we will use the provided Python code structure and classes to define each activity or transition in the workflow. We'll create nodes representing activities (e.g., `Service Request`, `Contract Setup`) and transitions defining how these activities are linked according to the described scenario. Silent transitions may not be explicitly needed here due to the absence of nondeterministic choices, but we can illustrate their usage if necessary.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to construct this POWL model in Python using the given classes:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

# Define SilentTransition if needed (though not used in this scenario)
SilentTransition = pm4py.objects.powl.obj.SilentTransition

# Step 1: Define the initial activity - Service Request Verification
service_request_verification = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")

# Step 2: Contract Setup is mandatory after verification
contract_setup = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# Step 3: Datacenter Allocation and Access Control Initialization can run in parallel.
datacenter_allocation = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
access_control_initiation = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

# Since DA and ACI are independent, they don't need explicit edges between them. 
# They will be part of a partial order later as dependent on the completion of Contract Setup.

# Step 4: Base Network Configuration followed by optional Debug & Reconfigure
base_network_configuration = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
debug_reconfigure = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")

# We'll encapsulate this loop structure within an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator.
configuration_loop = pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.OperatorPOWL(
    operator=pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.LOOP,
    children=[base_network_configuration, debug_reconfigure]
)

# Step 5: Exclusive choice for deployment method (Containerized or Monolithic)
container_deployment = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
monolithic_deployment = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")

# Create an exclusive choice between the two deployments.
deployment_choice = pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.OperatorPOWL(
    operator=pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.XOR,
    children=[container_deployment, monolithic_deployment]
)

# Step 6: Final tasks - QA and Security Audit can be concurrent or ordered
quality_assurance = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
security_audit = Transition(label="Security Audit")

final_tasks_partial_order = pm4py.objects.powl.obj.StrictPartialOrder()
final_tasks_partial_order.order.add_edge(quality_assurance, security_audit)  # Ensuring both are completed before GLA

# Step 7: Go-Live Approval after QA and SA
go_live_approval = Transition(label="Go Live Approval")

# Now we assemble the full POWL model using StrictPartialOrder to represent all nodes and their dependencies.
powl_model = pm4py.objects.powl.obj.StrictPartialOrder()

# Linking initial activities and mandatory prerequisites:
powl_model.order.add_edge(service_request_verification, contract_setup)
powl_model.order.add_edge(contract_setup, datacenter_allocation)  # DA is independent of ACI
powl_model.order.add_edge(datacenter_allocation, access_control_initiation)

# Adding the configuration loop to the model:
powl_model.nodes.extend([configuration_loop])
powl_model.order.add_edge(contract_setup, configuration_loop)  # After CS, start loop

# Incorporating deployment choice after configuration:
powl_model.order.add_edge(configuration_loop, deployment_choice)

# Finally linking all tasks for Go Live Approval at the end of the model
final_tasks_partial_order.nodes.extend([quality_assurance, security_audit, go_live_approval])
final_tasks_partial_order.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, final_tasks_partial_order)  # Ensure everything is done before GLA

# Adding the partial order to our overall POWL model:
powl_model.nodes.extend(final_tasks_partial_order)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transitions**: Each activity or decision point in the process has been defined as a `Transition` instance, representing an action that can occur when certain conditions are met (e.g., verification of the service request).

2. **Loops & Operators**:
   - The configuration loop for setting up the network is encapsulated using `OperatorPOWL` with the `LOOP` operator, indicating repeated execution until a stable state is achieved.
   - For the deployment choice between Containerized and Monolithic deployments, we use another `OperatorPOWL` instance but this time with the `XOR` operator to represent an exclusive choice (only one path will be taken).

3. **Partial Orders**:
   - We utilize `StrictPartialOrder` to define dependencies in the workflow. Dependencies such as requiring contract setup before any technical configuration are explicitly added using `.order.add_edge(source_node, target_node)`.
   - The final tasks' partial order ensures that QA and Security Audit must be completed before Go-Live Approval, with an option for concurrency between them.

4. **Assembly**:
   - All nodes (activities or transitions) are combined into a cohesive `StrictPartialOrder` model, which encapsulates the entire workflow.
   - This structured representation allows us to visualize the dependencies and possible execution paths clearly, facilitating further analysis or implementation of the digital service provisioning process.

This structure provides a clear and comprehensive representation of the described scenario in POWL format, adhering closely to the specifications provided.
