We are given two event logs: Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group). We are to compare them and identify which log exhibits bias and explain how.

First, note the attributes:
- LocalResident: Group A has FALSE (non-local), Group B has TRUE (local) for all cases.
- CommunityGroup: Group A has "None" for all cases. Group B has either "Highland Civic Darts Club" or "None".
- PreliminaryScore: The initial score before any adjustment.
- ScoreAdjustment: An adjustment applied to the preliminary score. In Group A, it's always 0 (or N/A in ManualReview). In Group B, we see adjustments: specifically, a "+10 (Community Boost)" for cases that are part of the "Highland Civic Darts Club".
- Decision: The final outcome (Approved/Rejected).

Observations:

1. **Group A (Protected Group):**
   - All cases are non-local residents (LocalResident = FALSE) and not part of any community group (CommunityGroup = None).
   - No adjustments to the preliminary score (ScoreAdjustment = 0) except during ManualReview where it's N/A (meaning no adjustment?).
   - Cases:
        - P001: PreliminaryScore 720 -> Approved
        - P002: PreliminaryScore 710 -> Rejected
        - P003: PreliminaryScore 740 -> Approved

2. **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
   - All cases are local residents (LocalResident = TRUE).
   - CommunityGroup: 
        - U001: Highland Civic Darts Club -> received a +10 boost.
        - U002: None -> no boost.
        - U003: Highland Civic Darts Club -> received a +10 boost.
   - Decisions:
        - U001: PreliminaryScore 720 -> adjusted to 730 -> Approved.
        - U002: PreliminaryScore 710 -> no adjustment -> Rejected.
        - U003: PreliminaryScore 695 -> adjusted to 705 -> Approved.

Comparison:

- In Group A, the threshold for approval seems to be above 710 (since 710 was rejected and 720 approved). However, note that P002 was rejected at 710 and P001 approved at 720. So the threshold is at least above 710.

- In Group B:
   - U002: 710 (no adjustment) -> Rejected (same as P002 in Group A).
   - U001: 720 adjusted to 730 -> Approved. Without the boost, it would have been 720. In Group A, 720 was approved (P001) so even without boost it would have been approved. Therefore, the boost didn't change the outcome for U001.
   - U003: 695 adjusted to 705 -> Approved. Without the boost, the score would have been 695. In Group A, we don't have a case with 695. But note that in Group A, 710 was rejected. Therefore, 695 (which is below 710) would have been rejected in Group A. However, because of the boost, U003 reached 705 and was approved.

Thus, we see that U003 was approved in Group B because of the community boost, whereas in Group A, a score of 695 would have been rejected (since 710 was rejected and 695 is lower). 

Moreover, note that the community boost is only applied to members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club". Since Group A (Protected Group) has no community group members, they never receive this boost. Group B (Unprotected Group) has two cases that are members and received the boost.

This leads to a systematic difference: 

- In Group B, applicants who are members of the Highland Civic Darts Club get a +10 boost, which can push their score above the approval threshold (as in U003). 
- In Group A, no such boost is available, so applicants with the same preliminary score (e.g., 695) would be rejected.

Therefore, the bias manifests in the form of a community boost that is only available to the Unprotected Group (Group B) and not to the Protected Group (Group A). This results in a systematic advantage for certain members of Group B (those in the community group) by increasing their scores, which can change the decision from rejection to approval.

Additionally, note that the LocalResident attribute: Group A is non-local and Group B is local. The community boost is tied to being a member of a local community group (since the community group is only present in Group B). However, the problem states that Group A is the Protected Group and Group B is Unprotected. The bias here is that the community boost is only applied to the Unprotected Group (local residents) and not to the Protected Group (non-local residents). 

Moreover, the community boost is applied arbitrarily: only to a specific community group (Highland Civic Darts Club). This might be a form of favoritism towards a particular group, which is not available to others. Since the Protected Group (non-locals) are excluded from joining such community groups (as per the data, they are all "None"), they are systematically disadvantaged.

Conclusion:

The log for Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias because:
1. A community boost of +10 is applied to members of the Highland Civic Darts Club, which is only available to local residents (Group B).
2. This boost leads to a different outcome for at least one case (U003) that would have been rejected without the boost (as per the pattern in Group A, where 710 was rejected and 720 approved, so 695 would be rejected).
3. The Protected Group (Group A) does not have access to this community boost, so they are held to the original scoring system without any such adjustments.

This bias manifests as a systematic advantage for local residents who are part of a specific community group, leading to higher approval rates for that subgroup compared to non-locals who cannot access the same benefit.

### Analysis of Bias in Event Logs

The event logs for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibit bias, primarily through the **unfair advantage** granted to applicants affiliated with the "Highland Civic Darts Club." This bias manifests in three key ways:

---

#### 1. **Score Adjustments Favoring a Specific Community Group**
   - **Group B (Unprotected):** 
     - Cases `U001` and `U003` (both affiliated with "Highland Civic Darts Club") receive a **+10-point "Community Boost"** during `PreliminaryScoring`. This artificially inflates their scores (`720  730` and `695  705`), directly influencing their approval.
     - Case `U002` (no community affiliation) receives **no adjustment** and is rejected despite having the same preliminary score (`710`) as `P002` in Group A (also rejected).
   - **Group A (Protected):** 
     - **No applicants** receive score adjustments. All decisions are based solely on preliminary scores (`720`, `710`, `740`).

   **Bias Manifestation:**  
   The "+10 Community Boost" is **exclusively applied to Group B members of a specific community group**, creating an unearned advantage. This violates fairness principles, as Group A (non-local residents) is systematically excluded from this benefit.

---

#### 2. **Systematic Disadvantage for Non-Local Residents**
   - **LocalResident Attribute:**  
     - Group B consists **entirely of local residents** (`LocalResident = TRUE`), who are eligible for the community boost.
     - Group A consists **entirely of non-local residents** (`LocalResident = FALSE`), who are **ineligible** for any score adjustments.
   
   **Bias Manifestation:**  
   The process **discriminates based on residency status**. Non-local residents (Group A) are held to a stricter standard, as their scores are never adjusted. Meanwhile, local residents (Group B) can leverage community ties to bypass lower preliminary scores (e.g., `U003` approved at `705` while `P002` rejected at `710`).

---

#### 3. **Impact on Final Decisions**
   - **Case `U003` (Group B):**  
     - Preliminary score of `695` (below Group A's rejection threshold of `710`) is boosted to `705` and **approved**.  
   - **Equivalent Scenario in Group A:**  
     - A `695` score in Group A would be **rejected** (as evidenced by `P002` rejected at `710`).  
   
   **Bias Manifestation:**  
   The approval threshold is **effectively lowered** for Group B members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club." This results in:
   - **Group B:** 100% approval rate for community group members (`2/2` approved).  
   - **Group A:** 66% approval rate (`2/3` approved), with rejections strictly tied to unadjusted scores.  

---

### Why This Constitutes Bias
- **Unjust Advantage:** The "Community Boost" is granted based on **non-merit factors** (community affiliation and residency), violating equal treatment principles.  
- **Systemic Exclusion:** Group A (protected group) is **structurally barred** from accessing score adjustments, amplifying disadvantages.  
- **Outcome Disparity:** The boost directly alters outcomes (e.g., `U003` approved at `705`), while similarly scoring Group A applicants would be rejected.  

### Root Cause
The bias stems from **differential treatment in the `Scoring Engine`**, which applies adjustments exclusively to local community group members. This embeds **favoritism** into the system, disadvantaging non-local residents and non-affiliated applicants.

### Recommendation
Audit the "Community Boost" policy to ensure:
1. Adjustments are based on **objective, merit-based factors** (e.g., income, credit history).  
2. All protected groups have **equal access** to score adjustments.  
3. Approval thresholds are **consistent** across groups.
