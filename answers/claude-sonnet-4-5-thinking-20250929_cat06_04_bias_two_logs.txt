# Bias Analysis: Comparison of Group A and Group B Event Logs

## Executive Summary

**Group B's process exhibits systemic bias that discriminates against Group A (Protected Group).** The bias manifests through a "Community Boost" mechanism that is structurally inaccessible to Group A members, creating an unequal two-tier approval system.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. **Disparate Access to Score Adjustments**

| Feature | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| LocalResident Status | FALSE (all cases) | TRUE (all cases) |
| Community Group Access | None (all cases) | Available to members |
| Score Adjustments | 0 (no boosts available) | +10 for community members |

**Critical Issue:** Group A members receive **zero score adjustments** across all cases, while Group B members with community affiliations receive systematic +10 point boosts.

---

### 2. **Effective Approval Threshold Inequality**

Comparing cases with similar preliminary scores reveals discriminatory treatment:

#### **Score 720 Comparison:**
- **P001 (Group A):** 720  No adjustment  720  **Approved**
- **U001 (Group B):** 720  +10 boost  730  **Approved**

Both approved, but U001 received an unnecessary advantage.

#### **Score 710 and Below - The Smoking Gun:**
- **P002 (Group A):** 710  No adjustment  710  **REJECTED**
- **U003 (Group B):** 695  +10 boost  705  **APPROVED**

**This reveals the bias:** A Group B applicant with a score **15 points lower** than a rejected Group A applicant gets approved due to community group membership.

---

### 3. **Structural Barriers**

The bias operates through three mechanisms:

```
Protected Group A              Unprotected Group B
                                    
LocalResident = FALSE          LocalResident = TRUE
                                    
No Community Groups      Community Groups Available
                                    
No Score Adjustments        +10 Community Boost
                                    
Need 720 to Approve        Need 695 to Approve
```

## How the Bias Manifests

### **Type 1: Indirect Discrimination**
The "Community Boost" policy appears neutral ("anyone in a community group gets +10 points") but has **disparate impact**:
- The community groups referenced (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club") are only available to local residents
- Group A members (LocalResident = FALSE) are systematically excluded from accessing these groups
- This creates a facially neutral rule that disproportionately harms the protected group

### **Type 2: Proxy Discrimination**
The attributes serve as proxies for protected characteristics:
- **LocalResident** correlates perfectly with group membership (TRUE for all Group B, FALSE for all Group A)
- **CommunityGroup** becomes a gatekeeping mechanism that perpetuates existing exclusion
- The system rewards social capital that the protected group cannot acquire

### **Type 3: Outcome Inequality**

**Effective approval rates at borderline scores:**

| Score Range | Group A Result | Group B Result (with community membership) |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 695-709 | **Rejection** | **Approval** (boosted to 705-719) |
| 710-719 | **Rejection** | **Approval** (boosted to 720-729) |
| 720+ | Approval | Approval (with inflated scores) |

Group B members have a **25-point wider approval band** (695-720) compared to Group A (720+).

## Legal and Ethical Concerns

### **1. Unjustifiable Differential Treatment**
- No evidence that community group membership predicts creditworthiness or loan performance
- The +10 adjustment is arbitrary and lacks actuarial justification
- Creates systematic disadvantage for newcomers, immigrants, or non-local residents

### **2. Feedback Loop Risk**
```
Group A excluded from community groups 
     Lower approval rates 
     Less economic integration 
     Continued exclusion from local networks 
     Perpetuation of disadvantage
```

### **3. Violation of Fairness Principles**
- **Equal treatment:** Not satisfied—identical preliminary scores receive different final decisions
- **Equal opportunity:** Not satisfied—access to score boosts is structurally unavailable to Group A
- **Meritocracy:** Violated—lower objective scores (695) achieve approval over higher scores (710)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action:** Remove or suspend the "Community Boost" adjustment until impact analysis is completed

2. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - If community engagement is relevant, create accessible alternatives for all applicants
   - Use objective, non-discriminatory factors (e.g., employment stability, savings history)
   - Ensure any adjustments are available equally to both groups

3. **Process Audit:** 
   - Review all cases where community adjustments changed outcomes
   - Assess whether Group A members were systematically disadvantaged
   - Calculate disparate impact ratios

4. **Policy Redesign:**
   - Establish clear, objective approval thresholds applied uniformly
   - Eliminate criteria that correlate with protected characteristics
   - Document business necessity for any differential treatment

## Conclusion

**The bias clearly resides in Group B's process**, though it manifests as favoritism toward Group B rather than explicit discrimination against Group A. This creates a system where Group A is effectively discriminated against through **structural exclusion** from beneficial treatment. The "Community Boost" mechanism serves as a **proxy for protected group status**, creating a **15-25 point approval advantage** for local residents with community connections—an advantage that is systematically unavailable to the protected group.

This constitutes **indirect discrimination with disparate impact** and requires immediate remediation.
