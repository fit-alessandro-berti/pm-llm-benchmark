Certainly! To construct a temporal profile for the global supply chain process in high-tech electronics manufacturing, we need to estimate the average times and standard deviations for the time delays between various pairs of activities. This includes both directly connected activities and those that are separated by multiple steps.

Explanation
Direct Pairs:

Estimated average times based on typical durations for consecutive activities.
Standard deviations account for variations in execution times.
Non-Consecutive Pairs:

Average times are summed from intermediate steps.
Standard deviations are combined using the square root of the sum of squares to get the overall standard deviation.
This temporal profile provides a comprehensive view of expected time delays and their variations between various activities in the supply chain process, aiding in better planning and anomaly detection.
