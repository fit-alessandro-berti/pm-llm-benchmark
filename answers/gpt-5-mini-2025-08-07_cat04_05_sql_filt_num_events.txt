Two equivalent DuckDB queries — pick one.

Option A — aggregate then join:
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) c USING (case_id)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;

Option B — window function:
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
FROM (
  SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS case_count
  FROM event_log
) t
WHERE case_count <= 6
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

(If you want to exclude NULL case_id values, add WHERE case_id IS NOT NULL in the inner query.)
