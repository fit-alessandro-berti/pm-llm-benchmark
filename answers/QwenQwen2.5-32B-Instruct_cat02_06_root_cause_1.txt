### Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

#### 1. Identification of Cases with Longer Resolution Times

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, we first calculate the total duration for each case from the "Receive Ticket" event to the "Close Ticket" event.

- **Case 101:**
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
  - End: 2024-03-01 10:15
  - Duration: 2 hours and 15 minutes

- **Case 102:**
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
  - End: 2024-03-02 09:15
  - Duration: 25 hours and 10 minutes

- **Case 103:**
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
  - End: 2024-03-01 09:30
  - Duration: 1 hour and 20 minutes

- **Case 104:**
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
  - End: 2024-03-02 08:30
  - Duration: 24 hours and 10 minutes

- **Case 105:**
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
  - End: 2024-03-03 09:30
  - Duration: 49 hours and 5 minutes

From the durations calculated, we can see that **Case 102**, **Case 104**, and **Case 105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to **Case 101** and **Case 103**.

#### 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

- **Escalations to Level-2 Agents:**
  - **Case 102** and **Case 105** both involve escalation to Level-2 agents, which is a significant factor leading to longer cycle times.
  - **Case 104** does not involve escalation but still has a long duration.

- **Long Waiting Times between Activities:**
  - **Case 102**: The investigation step after escalation took 6 hours (from 11:30 to 14:00 on the same day), which might indicate delays in receiving necessary information or lack of immediate availability of Level-2 agents.
  - **Case 104**: The investigation step took 3.5 hours (from 13:00 to 08:00 the next day), which could be due to the Level-1 agent not being able to proceed until the next day.
  - **Case 105**: The investigation step after escalation took 28.5 hours (from 10:00 on the first day to 14:00 on the third day), indicating significant delays in the escalation process and investigation.

#### 3. Insights and Recommendations to Address Performance Bottlenecks

- **Streamline Escalation Processes:**
  - Implement a more efficient escalation process to minimize delays.
  - Provide Level-2 agents with better visibility into the tickets they are handling, enabling quicker response times.

- **Reduce Waiting Times Between Activities:**
  - Ensure Level-1 agents have the necessary tools and information to handle tickets effectively and escalate only when absolutely necessary.
  - Improve communication and collaboration between Level-1 and Level-2 agents to reduce waiting times during the investigation phase.

- **Improve Resource Allocation:**
  - Ensure Level-2 agents are available during regular business hours to handle escalations promptly.
  - Consider rotating Level-2 agents on a regular basis to prevent burnout and ensure freshness in their approach to complex issues.

- **Implement Time Tracking and Performance Metrics:**
  - Monitor key performance indicators such as average resolution time and time spent in each stage of the process.
  - Use these metrics to identify trends and bottlenecks, and continuously refine processes to improve efficiency.

By addressing these factors, the support ticket resolution process can be optimized, leading to shorter resolution times and improved customer satisfaction.
