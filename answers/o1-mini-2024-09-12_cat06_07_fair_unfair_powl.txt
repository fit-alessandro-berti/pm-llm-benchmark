Certainly! Below are the two **POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language)** models representing the hiring process at **GlobalTeq Solutions**. 

1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:** This model includes an **XOR** branching after the skill assessment, where applicants can either undergo a standard cultural fit evaluation or a community affiliation check that may introduce subtle biases.

2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness:** This model removes the potential bias by ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation without any preferential branching.

Both models are implemented using the `pm4py` library in Python.

## 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, after the **SkillAssessment**, there's an **XOR** choice between **CulturalFitCheck** and **CommunityAffiliationCheck**. The presence of the **CommunityAffiliationCheck** branch introduces the potential for subtle biases.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define Loop for Data Completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define XOR Branch for Cultural Fit
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the main workflow
# Order: ReceiveApplication -> loop -> SkillAssessment -> xor -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the order of execution
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# The POWL model with potential unfairness is now defined in 'root'
```

### **Model Explanation:**

1. **ReceiveApplication:** The process starts with receiving the application.
2. **DataCompletenessCheck & RequestMoreInfo:** These activities form a loop ensuring that all necessary data is provided. If data is incomplete, the applicant is prompted to provide more information.
3. **SkillAssessment:** Applicants undergo a skill-based assessment.
4. **XOR Branch:**
   - **CulturalFitCheck:** Standard cultural fit evaluation.
   - **CommunityAffiliationCheck:** Checks for community affiliations, potentially introducing bias by giving a subtle advantage to affiliated applicants.
5. **ManagerialReview:** A hiring manager reviews borderline candidates.
6. **FinalDecision:** The final hiring decision is made.

## 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model removes the **CommunityAffiliationCheck**, ensuring all applicants undergo the same **CulturalFitCheck** without any preferential branching.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define Loop for Data Completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the main workflow without XOR branching
# Order: ReceiveApplication -> loop -> SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the order of execution
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# The POWL model without unfairness is now defined in 'root'
```

### **Model Explanation:**

1. **ReceiveApplication:** The process starts with receiving the application.
2. **DataCompletenessCheck & RequestMoreInfo:** These activities form a loop ensuring that all necessary data is provided. If data is incomplete, the applicant is prompted to provide more information.
3. **SkillAssessment:** Applicants undergo a skill-based assessment.
4. **CulturalFitCheck:** All applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation without any branching based on community affiliations.
5. **ManagerialReview:** A hiring manager reviews borderline candidates.
6. **FinalDecision:** The final hiring decision is made.

## **Visual Representation**

While the above code defines the POWL models programmatically, here's a high-level visual representation of both models for clarity.

### **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**

```
ReceiveApplication
       |
       v
DataCompletenessCheck --(loop)--> RequestMoreInfo
       |
       v
SkillAssessment
       |
       v
      XOR
     /    \
Cultural  Community
FitCheck AffiliationCheck
     \    /
      v
ManagerialReview
       |
       v
FinalDecision
```

### **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness:**

```
ReceiveApplication
       |
       v
DataCompletenessCheck --(loop)--> RequestMoreInfo
       |
       v
SkillAssessment
       |
       v
CulturalFitCheck
       |
       v
ManagerialReview
       |
       v
FinalDecision
```

## **Summary**

- **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:** Introduces an **XOR** branch that allows for a **CommunityAffiliationCheck**, potentially giving preferential treatment to certain applicants based on community affiliations or educational backgrounds.
  
- **POWL Model Without Unfairness:** Ensures all applicants are treated equally by undergoing the same **CulturalFitCheck** without any additional biased branching.

By implementing the second model, **GlobalTeq Solutions** can enhance the fairness and transparency of its hiring process, mitigating the risk of subtle biases influencing hiring decisions.
