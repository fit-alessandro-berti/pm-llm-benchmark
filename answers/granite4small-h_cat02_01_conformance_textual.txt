To determine which of the given cases deviate from the expected normative process outlined in the text, we'll need to systematically analyze each case according to the rules laid out.

### Normative Process Summary:
1. **Start**: "Receive order"
2. **Inventory Check**: Must occur immediately after receiving an order.
3. **Payment Authorization**:
   - Occurs only if inventory is sufficient.
   - Must happen before packaging items and cannot precede inventory check.
4. **Packaging Items**: Occurs after payment authorization (if applicable).
5. **Shipping Order**: Happens after packaging but never occurs after cancellation.
6. **Closing Order**: Final step in all scenarios.

### Case-by-Case Analysis:

#### Case 1:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Package items
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Analysis:**
- This case follows the normative process correctly.
- No deviations detected.

#### Case 2:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Package items
4. Authorize payment
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Analysis:**
- **Violation**: Packaging occurs before authorization of payment, which violates the requirement that "Authorize payment" should happen after "Check inventory" and before packaging.
- This is a clear deviation from the normative process.

#### Case 3:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Cancel order
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Analysis:**
- **Violation**: Shipping occurs after cancellation, which violates the rule that "Ship order" should not occur if there is a cancellation step before it.
- This violates the process flow described for both scenarios involving inventory sufficiency and insufficiency.

#### Case 4:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Cancel order
4. Close order

**Analysis:**
- This case adheres to the normative process correctly, as per insufficient inventory scenario.
- No deviations detected.

#### Case 5:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Ship order
5. Close order

**Analysis:**
- **Assumption**: Since there is no indication in this case log of any cancellation or packaging steps, we assume that the "Check inventory" step verified sufficient stock.
- The sequence follows a logical flow for when inventory is sufficient:
  - Receive order  Check inventory (assumed sufficient)  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
- This case adheres to the normative process correctly.

### Summary of Deviations:

- **Case 2** violates the rule that "Authorize payment" must occur before packaging.
- **Case 3** involves a deviation by shipping an order after it has been canceled, which goes against the stated rules.

Cases 1, 4, and 5 follow the normative process correctly. Case 2 is flagged for violating the sequence of operations concerning payment authorization and packaging. Case 3 deviates from expected sequences involving cancellations and shipping.
