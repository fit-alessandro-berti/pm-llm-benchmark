## Process Mining for Optimizing Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions

### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

#### **Metrics to Analyze:**
To analyze individual agent and tier performance, focus on:
- **Workload Distribution**: Measure the number of tickets each agent or tier handles per time period (e.g., daily, weekly). Identify imbalances indicating overloading or underutilization.
- **Activity Processing Times**: Track how long it takes for agents to complete their tasks (first response, resolution initiation, escalation, etc.). Compare these across tiers and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1**: Analyze the percentage of tickets resolved by L1 agents on first contact. This metric reveals efficiency and effectiveness in initial support.
- **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills**: Examine how often specific categories or skill requirements lead to reassignments or escalations, indicating possible mismatches.

#### **Process Mining Techniques:**
Use the following process mining techniques:
1. **Resource Interaction Analysis**: Map interactions between agents and tickets across tiers. Identify frequent handovers and compare them with intended logic, revealing deviations such as unintended escalations or reassignments.
2. **Social Network Analysis Based on Handovers**: Construct a network showing how tickets move between agents (nodes) over time. This visualizes bottlenecks and identifies influential nodes (agents who frequently handle high-reassignment cases).
3. **Role Discovery**: Identify distinct roles or subgroups within the agent pool based on their handling of specific categories or skills, providing insights into specialization gaps.

#### **Skill Utilization Analysis:**
Examine how specialized skills are being used:
- Map the skill sets required for tickets against those possessed by agents. Identify instances where highly skilled agents handle tasks beneath their capabilities, indicating underutilization or inefficient deployment.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

#### **Specific Problems:**
Based on the process mining insights:
1. **Skill Mismatch**: Determine if SLA breaches correlate with tickets escalated due to skill mismatch (e.g., L1 misassigning P2/P3 based on incorrect categorization).
2. **Frequent Reassignments**: Identify recurring patterns where reassignments occur, especially within tiers or between similarly skilled agents, leading to delays.
3. **Overloaded Agents/Teams**: Highlight overburdened agents or teams using workload distribution metrics and compare against SLA targets.
4. **Underutilized Specialists**: Recognize specialists often assigned to routine tasks, indicating a need for skill alignment.
5. **Initial Miscategorization**: Assess the impact of incorrect initial categorization on escalation rates.

#### **Quantification:**
- Measure average delay caused by reassignments (e.g., time difference between creation and resolution post-reassignment).
- Calculate percentage of SLA breaches directly linked to skill mismatch by cross-referencing resolved tickets with required skills.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

#### **Potential Causes:**
1. **Inefficient Assignment Rules**: Current logic (round-robin) may not consider agent skills or workload, leading to mismatches and ineffective use of resources.
2. **Incomplete/Inaccurate Agent Skills**: Incorrect skill profiles can result in improper initial assignments.
3. **Poor Ticket Categorization**: Inconsistent categorization complicates routing and increases reassignment chances.
4. **Lack of Real-time Visibility**: Limited insight into agent availability hinders dynamic assignment.
5. **Insufficient L1 Training/Empowerment**: Underprepared L1 agents may escalate prematurely, overloading higher tiers.

#### **Variant and Decision Mining:**
Use variant analysis to compare well-handled cases (smooth assignments) against poorly handled ones (numerous reassignments). Extract decision rules from these variations to pinpoint inefficient assignment criteria.

### 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

#### **Proposed Strategies:**
1. **Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weights**:
   - *Issue Addressed*: Skill mismatch and overloading of specialists.
   - *Process Mining Leverage*: Utilize skill maps and usage patterns to assign tickets based on both possessed skills and proficiency levels, optimizing efficiency.
   - *Data Required*: Detailed agent skill profiles, historical ticket skill requirements.
   - *Expected Benefits*: Increased FCR rate, fewer reassignments, improved SLA compliance.

2. **Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**:
   - *Issue Addressed*: Uneven workload distribution and overloading of specific agents/teams.
   - *Process Mining Leverage*: Use real-time workload metrics to dynamically allocate tickets considering current agent availability and queue lengths.
   - *Data Required*: Historical and real-time workload data, agent capacity thresholds.
   - *Expected Benefits*: Reduced average resolution times, balanced workload across agents/teams.

3. **Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics**:
   - *Issue Addressed*: Inaccurate initial categorization leading to escalations.
   - *Process Mining Leverage*: Analyze ticket descriptions and historical data to predict required skills before contact initiation, guiding initial routing decisions.
   - *Data Required*: Textual analysis of ticket descriptions, historical outcomes linked to similar tickets.
   - *Expected Benefits*: Reduced unnecessary escalations, improved first-contact resolution rates.

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

#### **Simulation Plan:**
- Utilize process simulation tools informed by mined models to simulate the impact of each strategy on key metrics (resolution times, SLA compliance, agent utilization).
- Test multiple scenarios considering varying ticket volumes and types.

#### **Implementation and Monitoring:**
- Deploy chosen strategies incrementally, starting with those least disruptive.
- Set up real-time process mining dashboards to track:
  - Average resolution time by tier and agent.
  - Number of reassignments per ticket type/category.
  - Agent utilization rates across tiers.
  - SLA adherence metrics (e.g., percentage of tickets resolved within agreed timeframes).
- Regularly review these KPIs to assess strategy effectiveness and make iterative improvements as needed. 

By leveraging process mining, TechSolve can gain deep insights into their resource assignment practices, identify critical issues, and implement targeted, data-driven strategies to enhance efficiency, improve service levels, and optimize agent utilization.
