<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to write a DuckDB SQL query that returns all events from the event_log table except those cases that have a specific sequence of activities with a time condition. Let me break down what's needed.

First, the key points from the prompt:

1. We need to find cases (case_id) that have the sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' → 'Create Order' → 'Confirm Order' in direct succession (no other events between them).
2. Among those cases, we only want to exclude the ones where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. Then, return all events except those from the excluded cases.

Wait, no. Wait. The third point says: "After identifying such cases, exclude them from your final result. You should only return events from cases that do not meet the above criteria." So, cases that have the sequence with the time >5 days are excluded. So the final result should be all events not in those cases.

Wait, let's clarify:

- Identify cases that have the exact sequence (Approve → Create → Confirm) in order, no other events between.
- Among those cases, further filter to only those where (Confirm Order timestamp - Create Order timestamp) > 5 days.
- Then, exclude those cases. So the final result should be all events from cases that are NOT in this excluded set.

So, the steps are:

1. Find all case_ids that have the sequence with the time condition (Create to Confirm >5 days).
2. Then, select all events from event_log where case_id is NOT in that list.

But how to find the cases with the sequence?

To find the sequence, since it's direct succession, for a given case_id, the events must be ordered by timestamp, and the three activities must appear consecutively.

So for a case_id, we need to check that there's an event with activity 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed immediately by 'Create Order', followed immediately by 'Confirm Order'.

So, in SQL terms, for each case_id, we can order the events by timestamp, and then check for the sequence.

One way to do this is to use window functions to get the next activity for each row, then check if the next activity is 'Create Order' and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

Wait, but the sequence is three in a row. So for the 'Approve' event, the next event should be 'Create', and the one after that should be 'Confirm'.

So, for each row (event) in the event_log, ordered by timestamp per case_id:

- If activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then check if the next activity (lead activity) is 'Create Order', and the one after that (lead lead) is 'Confirm Order'.

But we need to do this for all cases, then group by case_id, and see if such a sequence exists.

Alternatively, we can use a self-join to find consecutive events.

But maybe a better way is to use window functions to get the next two activities.

Let me think. For each event in a case, ordered by timestamp, we can get the next activity and the one after that.

So, using lead() twice.

So, for a given case_id, the sequence would be:

- activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
- lead(activity, 1) = 'Create Order'
- lead(activity, 2) = 'Confirm Order'

But we need to make sure that these are consecutive. So, for the row where activity is 'Approve', the next row (same case_id, next timestamp) should be 'Create', and the one after that should be 'Confirm'.

So, the query to find the case_ids that have this sequence would be:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
SELECT
case_id,
activity,
LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity
FROM event_log
)
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

This should give us all case_ids where the three activities are in sequence.

Then, from these case_ids, we need to find those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

Wait, but in the above, we have the sequence. Now, for each such case_id, we need to check the timestamp between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.

Wait, but the 'Create Order' is the next event after 'Approve', and 'Confirm Order' is the one after that. So, the timestamp for 'Create Order' is the timestamp of the row where activity is 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' is the next row.

So, for the case_id that has the sequence, we need to find the time difference between the 'Create Order' timestamp and 'Confirm Order' timestamp.

But how to get that in the query.

Alternatively, in the same window function approach, we can get the timestamp of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

Wait, maybe for the rows where activity is 'Create Order', we can get the timestamp of the next event (which should be 'Confirm Order' in the sequence), and compute the difference.

But perhaps it's easier to first get the case_ids that have the sequence, then for each case_id, find the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

Wait, but in the sequence, 'Create Order' is the second event, 'Confirm Order' is the third. So for each case_id that has the sequence, there's exactly one occurrence of this sequence (assuming no duplicates), so we can get the timestamp of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' for that case.

So, perhaps we can do:

First, find all case_ids where the sequence exists (using the lead approach), then for those case_ids, find the timestamp difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

Wait, but how to get the timestamps for those specific events.

Alternative approach: For the cases that have the sequence, join the event_log table to get the timestamps of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' for the sequence.

So, step 1: Identify case_ids with the sequence.

Step 2: For those case_ids, find the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events (i.e., the timestamp of 'Confirm Order' minus timestamp of 'Create Order').

Step 3: Filter case_ids where this difference > 5 days.

Step 4: Exclude these case_ids from the final result.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
SELECT
case_id,
timestamp AS create_order_timestamp,
LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
)
WHERE activity = 'Create Order'
AND (confirm_order_timestamp - create_order_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
)

Wait, but this might not be correct. Let's think.

Wait, in the inner query, we want to find the 'Create Order' events that are followed by 'Confirm Order' (as per the sequence), but the sequence is 'Approve' → 'Create' → 'Confirm', so the 'Create Order' is the second event, and the next event is 'Confirm Order'.

So, for the 'Create Order' event, the next event (in the sequence) is 'Confirm Order', so the timestamp difference would be between the 'Create Order' timestamp and the next event's timestamp (which is 'Confirm Order').

So, in the inner query, for each 'Create Order' event, if the next activity is 'Confirm Order', then compute the time difference.

Wait, but in the sequence, the 'Create Order' is followed by 'Confirm Order', so the next event after 'Create Order' should be 'Confirm Order'.

So, the correct way is:

For case_ids where the sequence exists (Approve → Create → Confirm), the time between Create and Confirm is the next event's timestamp minus Create's timestamp.

So, the inner query to find case_ids where the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days would be:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
SELECT
case_id,
timestamp AS create_ts,
LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
FROM event_log
)
WHERE activity = 'Create Order'
AND LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order'
AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

Wait, but the LEAD(activity,1) here would check if the next activity is 'Confirm Order', which is part of the sequence. So, the 'Create Order' must be followed by 'Confirm Order' (which is part of the sequence), so the time difference between them is what we need.

But also, the sequence requires that 'Approve' comes before 'Create', so the case_id must have the 'Approve' before 'Create', but since we're checking for the 'Create Order' followed by 'Confirm Order', and the sequence is three in a row, the 'Approve' is the one before 'Create', but we don't need to check that in this part because the case_id is already part of the sequence.

Wait, no. The case_id must have the sequence, so if we're getting case_ids where 'Create Order' is followed by 'Confirm Order', but we need to ensure that the 'Approve' is immediately before 'Create', otherwise it's not the correct sequence.

Wait, the problem says the three activities must be in direct succession. So the sequence must be Approve → Create → Confirm. So, the 'Create Order' must be immediately after 'Approve', and 'Confirm' immediately after 'Create'.

So, the case_id must have the three activities in order with no other events between. So, the 'Create Order' must be the next event after 'Approve', and 'Confirm' the next after 'Create'.

Therefore, to find the case_ids where the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days, we need to ensure that the Create is immediately followed by Confirm (so the next event after Create is Confirm), and also that the event before Create is Approve.

But in the inner query, if we check that activity = 'Create Order' and next activity = 'Confirm Order', that ensures that Create is followed by Confirm. But to ensure that Approve is followed by Create, we need to check that the event before Create is Approve.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to first find the case_ids that have the exact sequence, then for those, check the time between Create and Confirm.

So, the first step is to find case_ids with the sequence (Approve → Create → Confirm), which can be done by checking for a row where activity = 'Approve', next activity = 'Create', next next activity = 'Confirm'.

Then, from those case_ids, check if the time between Create and Confirm is >5 days.

So, the inner query for the excluded cases would be:

SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
SELECT
case_id,
timestamp AS approve_ts,
LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
FROM event_log
)
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order'
AND LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order'
AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

Wait, but in the window function, we can't use LEAD in the WHERE clause directly. So, perhaps it's better to use a subquery where we compute the lead activities first.

So, the correct way is to have a CTE that computes the lead activities, then filter.

So:

WITH sequence_events AS (
SELECT
case_id,
activity,
LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
FROM event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM sequence_events
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

This would give the case_ids where the sequence exists and the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days.

Then, the final query is to select all events from event_log where case_id is not in this list.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
WITH sequence_events AS (
SELECT
case_id,
activity,
LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
FROM event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM sequence_events
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
);

Wait, but in DuckDB, can we use CTEs in subqueries like that? Yes, but the syntax might need to be adjusted.

Alternatively, to avoid using CTEs in the subquery, we can write it as a subquery.

But DuckDB supports CTEs in subqueries, so the above should work.

Wait, but the problem is that in the inner query, we're using LEAD(timestamp, 1) and LEAD(timestamp, 2), but the LEAD function in DuckDB requires the partitioning and ordering.

Wait, but in the subquery, the LEAD is computed over the partition by case_id and ordered by timestamp, which is correct.

Another thing to note: the time difference. In DuckDB, the difference between two timestamps can be calculated using subtraction, and then compared to an interval. So, (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY.

But let's confirm: in DuckDB, the interval is specified with '5' DAY, so that's correct.

Now, let's test this logic.

Suppose a case has the sequence:

timestamp: 2023-01-01, activity: Approve

timestamp: 2023-01-02, activity: Create

timestamp: 2023-01-08, activity: Confirm

Then, the time between Create (2023-01-02) and Confirm (2023-01-08) is 6 days, which is more than 5. So this case should be excluded.

In the inner query, for the row with activity 'Approve', the next_activity is 'Create', next_next_activity is 'Confirm', and confirm_ts - create_ts = 6 days >5, so case_id is selected for exclusion.

Thus, the final query would exclude this case.

Another example: if the sequence is Approve → Create → Confirm, but the time between Create and Confirm is 4 days, then this case is not excluded, so it remains in the result.

Now, the problem says to return all events except those from cases that match both the sequence and the timing condition.

So, the query should exclude all events from the case_id that are in the inner query.

Therefore, the final query is as above.

But let's check if the LEAD functions are correctly applied.

In the sequence_events CTE, for each row, we get the next activity and the next next activity.

For the row where activity is 'Approve', the next_activity should be 'Create', and next_next_activity 'Confirm'.

Then, the create_ts is the timestamp of the next row (which is 'Create'), and confirm_ts is the timestamp of the row after that (which is 'Confirm').

So, the time between Create and Confirm is confirm_ts - create_ts, which is correct.

Yes.

Another edge case: if a case has multiple sequences, but we're using DISTINCT case_id, so even if a case has multiple occurrences of the sequence, it's only counted once.

The problem says "any case that contains the following sequence", so even one occurrence is enough to exclude the entire case.

So, using DISTINCT case_id is correct.

Now, let's write the query.

Wait, but in the CTE, the LEAD(timestamp, 1) is the timestamp of the next event, which is 'Create Order', and LEAD(timestamp, 2) is the timestamp of the event after that, which is 'Confirm Order'.

So, create_ts = timestamp of 'Create Order', confirm_ts = timestamp of 'Confirm Order'.

Thus, confirm_ts - create_ts is the time between Create and Confirm.

So, the condition (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY is correct.

Now, putting it all together.

The final query should be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM (
SELECT
case_id,
activity,
LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
FROM event_log
) AS seq
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
);

Wait, but in DuckDB, the syntax for LEAD is LEAD(expression, offset) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...), so the above is correct.

Also, the subquery inside the NOT IN needs to be a valid query.

Another thing: the LEAD(timestamp, 1) and LEAD(timestamp, 2) might return NULL if there's no next event. But in the WHERE clause, we're checking for next_activity = 'Create Order' and next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order', so if the next activity is not 'Create Order', then the row won't be selected, so the NULLs would be filtered out.

For example, if a case has 'Approve' as the last event, then next_activity would be NULL, so it won't be in the WHERE clause.

Thus, the inner query will only include rows where the sequence exists.

So, the query should work.

Let me check if the syntax is correct.

In DuckDB, the INTERVAL is written as INTERVAL '5' DAY.

Yes.

Also, the subtraction of timestamps gives a duration, which can be compared to an interval.

Yes.

So, the query should be correct.

Now, let's make sure we're not including cases where the sequence is not present.

For example, if a case has 'Approve', 'Create', 'Confirm' but with other activities in between, then the next_activity would not be 'Create' for the 'Approve' row, so it won't be selected.

Thus, the query correctly filters only the direct succession.

Another point: the problem says "three activities in direct succession: Approve, Create, Confirm". So, the three events must be consecutive. So, no other events between them. Which is exactly what the LEAD functions check.

Yes.

Therefore, the query should be correct.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to identify all events in the `event_log` table that do **not** belong to cases containing the exact sequence of activities `'Approve Purchase Requisition' → 'Create Order' → 'Confirm Order'` with the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` exceeding 5 days. 

### Approach
1. **Identify Cases with the Sequence**: 
   - Use window functions to check for consecutive activities in the specified order. For each event, verify that the next activity is `'Create Order'` and the one after that is `'Confirm Order'`.
   
2. **Check Time Condition**:
   - For cases identified in step 1, compute the time difference between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` timestamps. Exclude cases where this difference exceeds 5 days.

3. **Exclude Matching Cases**:
   - The final result should include all events **except** those from cases that match both the sequence and the time condition.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_ts,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_ts
        FROM event_log
    ) AS seq
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
);
```

### Explanation
1. **Inner Subquery**:
   - The subquery uses `LEAD()` to look ahead at the next two activities and their timestamps for each event in the `event_log`.
   - It filters rows where the current activity is `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, the next activity is `'Create Order'`, and the activity after that is `'Confirm Order'`.
   - It also checks that the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` (using `confirm_ts - create_ts`) exceeds 5 days.

2. **Exclusion**:
   - The `NOT IN` clause ensures that all events from cases matching the above criteria are excluded from the final result.
   - `DISTINCT case_id` ensures each case is only considered once, even if it contains multiple qualifying sequences.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The query returns all events from `event_log` where the `case_id` is **not** in the list of excluded cases, fulfilling the requirement to exclude only those cases meeting both the sequence and time condition.

This solution efficiently leverages DuckDB's window functions to handle sequential event analysis and time-based filtering, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.
