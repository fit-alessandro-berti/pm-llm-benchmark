# Integrated Event Log Analysis

## Merged Event Log

| Timestamp | Event Name | Order ID | User ID | Resource ID | Notes | Source |
|-----------|------------|----------|---------|------------|-------|--------|
| 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z | Order Received | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | "Event captured at warehouse system" | Merged (A+B) |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z | Order Validated | Order#1234 | u12 | r10 | "Cross-check inventory" | Merged (A+B) |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | Payment Processed | Order#1234 | u12 | r99 | "Payment gateway delay" | Merged (A+B) |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z | Quality Check | Order#1234 | u45 | r11 | "Random inspection" | Log B only |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z | Item Shipped | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | "Package handed to courier" | Merged (A+B) |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z | Item Delivered | Order#1234 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Log A only |

## Event Matching Rationale

### 1. Order Received
- **Log A**: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, "Order Received"
- **Log B**: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, "OrderReceived"
- **Decision**: Merged - timestamps within 2-second tolerance; nearly identical event names
- **Timestamp choice**: Used Log B's earlier timestamp as it likely represents when the event actually started

### 2. Order Validated
- **Log A**: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, "Order Validated"
- **Log B**: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, "OrderValidation"
- **Decision**: Merged - timestamps within 2-second tolerance; semantically identical event names (past tense vs. noun form)
- **Timestamp choice**: Used Log B's earlier timestamp

### 3. Payment Processed
- **Log A**: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, "Payment Processed"
- **Log B**: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, "PaymentCheck"
- **Decision**: Merged despite 5-second difference (exceeding tolerance) based on:
  - Both events refer to payment processing
  - Log B's notes mention "Payment gateway delay" which explains the timestamp discrepancy
- **Timestamp choice**: Used Log A's timestamp for consistency with primary timeline

### 4. Quality Check (Log B only)
- No corresponding event in Log A
- Included as-is from Log B

### 5. Item Shipped
- **Log A**: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, "Item Shipped"
- **Log B**: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, "Shipping"
- **Decision**: Merged - timestamps within 2-second tolerance; semantically related event names
- **Timestamp choice**: Used Log A's timestamp for consistency with primary timeline

### 6. Item Delivered (Log A only)
- No corresponding event in Log B
- Included as-is from Log A

## Integration Methodology & Challenges

### Timestamp Resolution
- Applied a 2-second tolerance for matching events
- Made exception for Payment event (5-second difference) based on contextual evidence
- Generally preferred Log B's earlier timestamps for the first events, then switched to Log A's timestamps for consistency

### Event Name Normalization
- Used Log A's naming convention for consistency (primarily past tense format)
- Successfully matched events despite naming variations:
  * Spacing vs. CamelCase ("Order Received" vs. "OrderReceived")
  * Verb tense differences ("Order Validated" vs. "OrderValidation")
  * Related but different terms ("Payment Processed" vs. "PaymentCheck")

### Attribute Integration
- Preserved all available attributes from both logs for merged events
- Used "N/A" for attributes not available in Log A-only events
- Retained all contextual notes from Log B which provide valuable process details

## Key Observations

1. **Timestamp patterns**: Log B consistently records events slightly earlier than Log A for matching events, confirming that Log A likely records event reception rather than initiation.

2. **System complementarity**: 
   - Log A provides the full process view through to delivery
   - Log B offers enhanced attribute detail and captures intermediary events (Quality Check)

3. **Missing event analysis**:
   - Log B lacks the "Item Delivered" event, likely because it focuses on warehouse/fulfillment operations
   - Log A omits the "Quality Check" event, possibly because it tracks primary process milestones only

## Recommendations for Future Integration

- Standardize event naming conventions between systems
- Add correlation IDs to facilitate more confident event matching
- Consider synchronizing system clocks to reduce timestamp variations
- Document expected timestamp offsets between systems to refine matching tolerances

This integrated log provides a comprehensive view of the entire order fulfillment process by leveraging the complementary information from both systems while maintaining chronological integrity.
