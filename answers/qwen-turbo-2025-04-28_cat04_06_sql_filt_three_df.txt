<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that returns all events from the event_log table except those that belong to cases that have a specific sequence of three activities in order, with the 'Create Order' to 'Confirm Order' taking more than 5 days. 

First, I need to understand the requirements clearly. The three activities must be consecutive in the case. So for a case_id, there should be an event with 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed immediately by 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order'. No other events in between. 

Then, among those cases that have this sequence, we need to check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. And then exclude all events from such cases. So the final result should not include any events from those cases.

So the plan is: 

1. Find all case_ids that have the sequence of the three activities in order, with no other events in between.
2. For those cases, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. Exclude all events from those cases.

But how to do this in SQL?

First, I need to find the cases that have the sequence. To find consecutive events, I can use window functions to assign row numbers based on the timestamp. For each case, order the events by timestamp. Then, for each event, check if the next event (row number +1) is the next activity in the sequence.

Alternatively, maybe using self-joins. But with DuckDB, perhaps using LAG or LEAD functions would be better.

Let me think. For each case, we can order the events by timestamp. Then, for each event, check if the next event (using LEAD) is the next activity. But since the sequence is three activities, maybe we need to check three consecutive events.

For example, for a case, if there's an event with activity 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then the next event (same case, next in order) is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

So, for each event in the log, we can check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and the next activity (LEAD) is 'Create Order', and the next next activity (LEAD with offset 2) is 'Confirm Order'. But this would require that the three events are consecutive.

But how to get the case_ids that have this sequence?

Alternatively, we can generate for each case a sequence of events ordered by timestamp, and then check if there's a triplet of consecutive events matching the required sequence.

But how to do that in SQL?

Maybe using a CTE (Common Table Expression) to assign row numbers to each event in a case, ordered by timestamp. Then, for each row, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next row (row_num +1) is 'Create Order', and the row after that (row_num +2) is 'Confirm Order'.

So, let's create a CTE where for each event, we have the row number within the case. Then, we can join the same CTE with itself, shifting by 1 and 2 rows.

For example:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        e1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events e1
    JOIN ordered_events e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.rn + 1 = e2.rn
    JOIN ordered_events e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id AND e1.rn + 2 = e3.rn
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
)

This would give us all case_ids that have the three consecutive activities in order.

Once we have those case_ids, we need to check the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. For each such case, we need to check if the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

But how to get that time difference? For the cases in the sequences CTE, we can find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. Let's think: for each case in sequences, there's at least one occurrence of the three activities. But maybe multiple occurrences? However, the problem says "any case that contains the sequence", so even if there are multiple occurrences, as long as one exists, the case is considered.

But for the time check, we need to check if in any of the sequences, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Wait, the problem says: "among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days."

So, for a case that has the sequence, if there exists at least one occurrence where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days, then the case is excluded. So we need to find all cases that have at least one such occurrence.

So, the steps are:

1. Find all case_ids that have the sequence of three activities in order (as above).
2. For those case_ids, check if any of their sequences have the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' > 5 days.
3. Exclude those cases from the final result.

So, first, let's get the case_ids that have the sequence. Then, for those cases, check if there's a 'Create Order' event and 'Confirm Order' event in the sequence where the time difference is more than 5 days.

So, perhaps we can create another CTE that for each case in the sequences, checks the time difference.

Alternatively, for the sequences CTE, we can calculate the time difference between e2 and e3 (since e2 is 'Create Order' and e3 is 'Confirm Order').

So, modifying the sequences CTE to include the time difference:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        e1.case_id,
        e2.timestamp AS create_order_time,
        e3.timestamp AS confirm_order_time
    FROM ordered_events e1
    JOIN ordered_events e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.rn + 1 = e2.rn
    JOIN ordered_events e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id AND e1.rn + 2 = e3.rn
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
filtered_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM sequences
    WHERE (confirm_order_time - create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

Then, the case_ids in filtered_sequences are the ones that need to be excluded.

So, the final step is to select all events from event_log where the case_id is not in the filtered_sequences.

But how to handle that in the query?

Putting it all together:

First, get all case_ids that have the sequence and the time condition. Then, select all events not in those case_ids.

But how to structure this in SQL.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        WITH ordered_events AS (
            SELECT 
                case_id,
                activity,
                timestamp,
                ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
            FROM event_log
        ),
        sequences AS (
            SELECT 
                e1.case_id
            FROM ordered_events e1
            JOIN ordered_events e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.rn + 1 = e2.rn
            JOIN ordered_events e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id AND e1.rn + 2 = e3.rn
            WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
              AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
              AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        ),
        filtered_sequences AS (
            SELECT s.case_id
            FROM sequences s
            JOIN ordered_events e2 ON s.case_id = e2.case_id
            JOIN ordered_events e3 ON s.case_id = e3.case_id
            WHERE e2.rn = (SELECT rn + 1 FROM ordered_events WHERE case_id = s.case_id AND activity = 'Create Order') 
            -- Wait, this part might be complicated. Maybe better to calculate the time difference in the sequences CTE.

Wait, maybe the sequences CTE should include the timestamps of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' so that we can compute the difference.

Let me adjust the sequences CTE to include those timestamps.

So:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        e1.case_id,
        e2.timestamp AS create_order_ts,
        e3.timestamp AS confirm_order_ts
    FROM ordered_events e1
    JOIN ordered_events e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.rn + 1 = e2.rn
    JOIN ordered_events e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id AND e1.rn + 2 = e3.rn
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
filtered_sequences AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM sequences
    WHERE confirm_order_ts - create_order_ts > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_sequences);

But wait, in the sequences CTE, for each occurrence of the sequence, we have the case_id, and the create_order_ts and confirm_order_ts. Then, in filtered_sequences, we select the case_ids where the time difference is more than 5 days. Then, the final query excludes those case_ids.

But what if a case has multiple sequences? For example, multiple instances of the three activities. But even if one of them meets the time condition, the case is excluded. So the filtered_sequences would have the case_id once, even if there are multiple occurrences. So the NOT IN would work.

But how to handle the case where a case has multiple sequences, some meeting the time condition and others not. But since the case is excluded if any of the sequences meet the condition, the NOT IN would work.

Now, the problem is that in the sequences CTE, we might have multiple entries per case_id. But when we do SELECT case_id FROM filtered_sequences, it's possible that a case_id appears multiple times, but in the NOT IN, it's handled as a set.

But in DuckDB, the NOT IN clause would work with a subquery that returns a list of case_ids.

But there's a potential problem if there are NULLs, but since case_id is a primary key or unique per case, probably not.

Now, let's test this logic.

But what about the ordering of the events? The ordered_events CTE uses ROW_NUMBER() with ORDER BY timestamp. So for each case, events are ordered by their timestamp. Then, the sequences are checked for consecutive rows.

But what if there are multiple events with the same timestamp? Well, the problem says that the events must be in direct succession, which implies that they are ordered by timestamp. So the ROW_NUMBER() would assign them in order, but if two events have the same timestamp, their order might be undefined. However, the problem may assume that timestamps are unique, or that the ordering is correct.

Assuming that the timestamps are unique, the ROW_NUMBER() will correctly order them.

Another thing: the LEAD function could also be used. For example, for each event, check if the next activity is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'. But using the row numbers and joining the same table with different rn values is another way.

But the current approach seems valid.

Now, let's think about the time difference. In DuckDB, the subtraction of timestamps gives a duration. So, confirm_order_ts - create_order_ts would be a duration. Then, comparing it to INTERVAL '5 days' would work.

But how is the duration represented? For example, if the difference is 5 days and 1 hour, then it's more than 5 days. So the condition is correct.

Now, putting all together.

But in the initial CTE, the sequences CTE is selecting case_id, create_order_ts, confirm_order_ts. Then, in filtered_sequences, we check if the difference is more than 5 days.

So the final query would be as written above.

But let's check for possible errors.

What if a case has the sequence but the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is less than or equal to 5 days? Then, it's not in filtered_sequences, so it's not excluded.

So the final query returns all events except those in cases that have the sequence and the time condition.

But the problem says that the final result should exclude events from cases that meet both the sequence and the timing condition.

Yes, that's exactly what this query does.

But what about cases that have the sequence but not the timing condition? They are not excluded, so their events are included.

Another thing: the query selects all events from event_log where case_id is not in the filtered_sequences. So all events from those cases are excluded. Which is correct.

Now, possible edge cases:

- A case that has the sequence but the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is exactly 5 days. It's not included in filtered_sequences, so the case is not excluded.

- A case that has multiple sequences. If any of them has the time condition, the case is excluded.

Now, what about the case where the sequence is not consecutive? For example, 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by another activity, then 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order'. The current approach would not capture that, because the row numbers must be consecutive. So the code correctly checks for consecutive events.

So, the query seems to handle that.

Now, the problem is that in DuckDB, the syntax for CTEs might require some adjustments. For example, in DuckDB, the WITH clause can be used with multiple CTEs. So the query would be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        e1.case_id,
        e2.timestamp AS create_order_ts,
        e3.timestamp AS confirm_order_ts
    FROM ordered_events e1
    JOIN ordered_events e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.rn + 1 = e2.rn
    JOIN ordered_events e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id AND e1.rn + 2 = e3.rn
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
filtered_sequences AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequences
    WHERE confirm_order_ts - create_order_ts > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_sequences);

Wait, but in the sequences CTE, for each occurrence of the sequence, we have a case_id. So if a case has multiple sequences, it will appear multiple times in sequences. But in filtered_sequences, we can use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates. Although, even without DISTINCT, the NOT IN would work, but using DISTINCT might be more efficient.

But the problem says that the case should be excluded if it has any such sequence. So even if a case has multiple sequences, once it's in filtered_sequences once, it's excluded. So adding DISTINCT is safe.

Another thing: the 'DISTINCT' in filtered_sequences might not be necessary, but it's better to have it to avoid duplicates.

Now, testing this query.

But what if there are no sequences? Then filtered_sequences is empty, and the NOT IN returns all events.

Another possible issue: the JOIN conditions. For example, when joining e1, e2, e3, are they all from the same case_id? Yes, because the ON clauses have e1.case_id = e2.case_id and e1.case_id = e3.case_id.

So this should work.

Now, let's think about the case where the sequence is present but the time difference is not more than 5 days. Then, the case is not in filtered_sequences, so it's included.

Another possible edge case: a case that has the sequence but the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' are not in the same sequence. But the code checks for the exact sequence, so that's handled.

I think this should work.

Now, translating this into the final query.

But the problem says that the final query should return all events from the event_log except those that belong to cases matching both the sequence and the timing condition.

Yes, this query does that.

So the final answer is the query as written above.
</think>
To address the problem, we need to identify all events in the `event_log` table that **do not** belong to any case that:

1. Contains the **exact sequence** of activities:  
   `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`  `'Create Order'`  `'Confirm Order'`  
   with **no intervening events** between them.

2. **And**, for such cases, the **time between** `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is **more than 5 days**.

The final result should return **all events** from the `event_log` **except** those from cases that meet **both** criteria.

---

###  Solution Strategy

We break the problem into the following logical steps:

1. **Order Events by Timestamp**:  
   For each `case_id`, assign a row number to each event in the order of their timestamps.

2. **Identify Valid Sequences**:  
   Use self-joins to find any case where the three required activities appear in **consecutive** order.

3. **Check Time Difference**:  
   For each valid sequence, compute the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'`.

4. **Filter Out Problematic Cases**:  
   Collect all `case_id`s that have at least one such sequence with a time difference greater than 5 days.

5. **Exclude Those Cases**:  
   Return all events **except** those that belong to the filtered `case_id`s.

###  SQL Query

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequences AS (
    SELECT
        e1.case_id,
        e2.timestamp AS create_order_ts,
        e3.timestamp AS confirm_order_ts
    FROM ordered_events e1
    JOIN ordered_events e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.rn + 1 = e2.rn
    JOIN ordered_events e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id AND e1.rn + 2 = e3.rn
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
filtered_sequences AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequences
    WHERE confirm_order_ts - create_order_ts > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_sequences);
```

---

###  Explanation of Key Parts

- **`ordered_events`**: This CTE ensures that events are ordered chronologically within each case.
- **`sequences`**: This CTE identifies all triplets of consecutive events matching the required sequence.
- **`filtered_sequences`**: Filters out only those `case_id`s where the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is more than 5 days.
- **Final `SELECT`**: Returns all events from the `event_log` **excluding** those from the filtered cases.

---

###  Edge Case Handling

- **Multiple Sequences**: If a case has multiple valid sequences, it is still excluded if **any** of them satisfies the time condition.
- **Duplicate Case IDs**: `DISTINCT` ensures that each case is only excluded once, even if it has multiple qualifying sequences.
- **No Matching Sequences**: If no such sequences exist, the final result includes all events.

---

###  Final Output

This query ensures that all events from cases that **have the exact sequence** and **exceed 5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'** are **excluded**, while all others are **retained**.
