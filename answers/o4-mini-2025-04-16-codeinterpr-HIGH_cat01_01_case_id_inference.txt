Here’s the most parsimonious way to slice these 18 interleaved events into three distinct patient journeys (“cases”), using patient_age + patient_gender + department as identifiers:

Case 1 – the 45-year-old male in the ER  
  Events:  
  1. 08:05:13 Register patient (45 M, ER)  
  4. 08:10:50 Initial triage (45 M, ER)  
  7. 08:15:42 X-ray imaging (45 M, ER)  
  12. 08:23:10 Doctor consultation (45 M, ER)  
  15. 08:30:05 Patient discharged (45 M, ER)  

Case 2 – the 62-year-old female in the ER  
  Events:  
  2. 08:07:02 Register patient (62 F, ER)  
  5. 08:12:29 Initial triage (62 F, ER)  
  8. 08:16:10 Lab test requested (62 F, ER)  
  10. 08:20:27 Lab test completed (62 F, Laboratory)  
  11. 08:22:54 Doctor consultation (62 F, ER)  
  14. 08:27:00 Prescription created (62 F, ER)  
  17. 08:35:29 Patient discharged (62 F, ER)  

Case 3 – the 28-year-old male in Surgery  
  Events:  
  3. 08:07:15 Register patient (28 M, Surgery)  
  6. 08:13:00 Doctor consultation (28 M, Surgery)  
  9. 08:16:45 Surgery preparation (28 M, Surgery)  
  13. 08:25:19 Surgery performed (28 M, Surgery)  
  16. 08:31:37 Recovery room (28 M, Surgery)  
  18. 08:40:13 Patient discharged (28 M, Surgery)  

Rationale: each event’s timestamp, department and patient demographics align into three coherent, non-overlapping sequences.
