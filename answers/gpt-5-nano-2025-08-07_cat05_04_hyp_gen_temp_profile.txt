Here are concise outputs aligned to the scenario: anomalies, possible explanations, and concrete SQL verification approaches.

Anomalies in the temporal profile model
- R to P (Receive  Approve) shows a mean of about 25 hours but with an unusually small SD (about 1 hour). That combination suggests a near-constant SLA for this leap, which is suspicious if the real process normally varies more due to reviews, checks, or backlogs.
- P to N (Approve  Notify) has a very long mean delay (about 7 days) with a large SD (about 2 days). This can indicate backlog-driven waiting, inconsistent handoffs, or sporadic processing bursts.
- A to C (Assign  Close) is short on average (about 2 hours) and may occur without the mid-process steps (e.g., Evaluate, Approve) observed in other claims. This raises concerns about premature closures.
- E to N (Evaluate  Notify) averages around 5 minutes with a very small SD (1 minute). This is unusually fast for a legitimate evaluation-to-notification handoff and may imply skipping steps or automated, unverified notifications.
- E to C (Evaluate  Close) shows about 1 hour on average but with a very large SD (around 50 minutes), indicating highly variable behavior around a core step, which could reflect inconsistent checks or inconsistent data quality.
- Overall pattern concerns: several pairs exhibit either extremely low variability where variability would be expected (RP) or extremely long/variable backlogs (PN). The combinations suggest the process timing may be rigid in some places and highly variable or incomplete in others.

Possible reasons for these anomalies
- System automation shortcuts: some transitions (e.g., EN, EC) could be automated or semi-automated, producing unrealistically fast or uniform timings.
- Manual data-entry bottlenecks: long delays (PN) may be driven by human queueing, backlog, or resource constraints.
- Premature closures: quick AC transitions may indicate claims being closed without full evaluation or validation steps.
- Missing or skipped steps: if E or P events frequently don’t occur in some claims, downstream timings (e.g., N or C) can appear anomalous.
- Inconsistent resources or regions: certain adjusters or regions may have uneven workloads, causing timing bursts or lags that distort the average plus high variance in some pairs.
- Data quality issues: incorrect timestamps, out-of-sequence events, or duplicate/missing events can produce artificial timing patterns.

Verification approaches using SQL (PostgreSQL)
Notes:
- The following queries assume claim_events contains one row per activity per claim with timestamps, and claims (plus adjusters) provide context. The temporal profile values used here are the ones shown in the example (R_A, R_E, R_P, A_C, E_N, E_C, P_N, N_C).
- We compute per-claim event timestamps for R, A, E, P, N, C, then derive deltas for the relevant pairs. We then flag deviations beyond a threshold (here, |delta - avg| > 3 * sd, i.e., roughly 3-sigma).
- If your resource field in claim_events (for A) maps to adjusters, you can join to the adjusters table to analyze by region/specialization. The examples below show how to do that, with notes on mapping.

Query 1 — identify per-claim deltas and flag deviations against the model (3-sigma rule)
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_R,

    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_C - t_E)) AS delta_E_C

SELECT

Note: You can trim or expand the UNION blocks to match exactly the model you are validating. The idea is to surface claims whose deltas for any pair differ meaningfully from the model.

Query 2 — identify the specific claims with the strongest deviation (aggregate 3-sigma flag)
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_R,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_A,

    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_N,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_C
  FROM claims c
  LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
),
deltas AS (

DESC
LIMIT 100;

This query surfaces claims with larger-than-expected deviations across multiple pairs, enabling prioritization for investigation.

Query 3 — correlate anomalies with adjusters (when A resources map to adjusters)
-- Assumes claim_events rows for 'A' have a resource that corresponds to adjuster_id (or adjuster name). Adjust mapping as needed.
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_R,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_A
  FROM claims c
  LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
),
anomalous_A AS (
  SELECT
    et.claim_id,
    ce.resource AS adjuster_resource
  FROM event_times et
  JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = et.claim_id
  WHERE ce.activity = 'A'
    -- example filter: only claims flagged as anomalous in A-related pairs
    -- (You can reuse the results from Query 1 here to filter to anomalous claims)
)
SELECT
  a.claim_id,
  a.adjuster_resource,
  adj.adjuster_id,
  adj.name,
  adj.region,
  adj.specialization,
  COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
FROM anomalous_A a
LEFT JOIN adjusters adj
  ON (CASE
        WHEN a.adjuster_resource ~ '^[0-9]+$' THEN adj.adjuster_id = CAST(a.adjuster_resource AS INTEGER)
        ELSE adj.name = a.adjuster_resource
     END)
GROUP BY a.claim_id, a.adjuster_resource, adj.adjuster_id, adj.name, adj.region, adj.specialization
ORDER BY anomaly_count DESC
LIMIT 50;

Note: You may need to adapt the join condition to how the claim_events.resource maps to your adjusters table (adjuster_id vs. name vs. another field). The goal is to see whether anomalous timings cluster around particular adjusters, regions, or specializations.

Query 4 — detect premature closings or missing mid-process steps (AC timing concerns)
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_A,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_C,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_E,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_P
  FROM claims c
  LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
)
SELECT
  claim_id,
  t_A,
  t_E,
  t_P,
  t_C,
  (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_C - t_A)) / 3600.0) AS hours_A_to_C,
  (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_E - t_A)) / 3600.0) AS hours_E_from_A
FROM event_times
WHERE t_A IS NOT NULL AND t_C IS NOT NULL
  AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_C - t_A)) < 3600) -- less than 1 hour (adjust threshold as needed)
  AND (t_E IS NULL OR t_E > t_C); -- E happened after C or is missing
-- This flags claims that closed quickly after assign with no (or late) evaluation.

Query 5 — detect unusually fast Evaluate-to-Notify transitions (EN) and other “too-fast” steps
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_E,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_N
  FROM claims c
  LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
)
SELECT
  claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_N - t_E)) AS delta_E_N_seconds
FROM event_times
WHERE t_E IS NOT NULL AND t_N IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_N - t_E)) < 180; -- less than 3 minutes, example threshold
-- Adjust the threshold to reflect the model's 5-minute mean and 1-minute SD; this helps flag unusually fast EN transitions.

Query 6 — backlog/slow-region analysis (P_N and N_C patterns by region or type)
WITH deltas AS (
  SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_P,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS t_N,
    c.claim_type,
    adj.region AS region
  FROM claims c
  LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT ce.claim_id, ce.resource AS adj_region
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.activity = 'A'
  ) a ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
  LEFT JOIN adjusters adj ON adj.adjuster_id = CAST(a.adj_region AS INTEGER) -- adjust as needed
  GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type, adj.region
)
SELECT
  region,
  claim_type,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_N - t_P)) / 86400.0) AS avg_days_P_N,
  STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t_N - t_P)) / 86400.0) AS stdev_days_P_N
FROM deltas
GROUP BY region, claim_type
ORDER BY avg_days_P_N DESC
LIMIT 100;

How to use and adapt
- Replace threshold values (e.g., 3*sd, 1 hour, 3 minutes) with the ZETA factor you want to apply (the example uses a 3-sigma rule for anomalies).
- If your claim_events.resource maps to an identifier in the adjusters table, adjust the joins accordingly (by adjuster_id or by name). If it maps to a separate mapping table, join through that mapping.
- You can expand or prune the pair checks in the anomaly queries to match exactly which activity pairs you want to enforce against the temporal_profile model.
- For larger analyses, you can wrap these into a view or materialized view to reuse the computed deltas and anomaly flags in dashboards or BI tools.

If you want, I can tailor the SQL to your exact data mappings (e.g., confirm how claim_events.resource corresponds to adjusters, and provide a single consolidated query that returns both per-claim deltas and an anomaly flag per pair).
