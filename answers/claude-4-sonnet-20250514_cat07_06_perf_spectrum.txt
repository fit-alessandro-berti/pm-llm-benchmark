This visualization appears to be an alluvial or flow diagram showing the progression of events across three distinct stages over time from 2000 to 2013. The diagram has three horizontal layers:

1. **Top layer - "Send Fine"**: Represented by gray vertical bars of varying heights and densities, suggesting the frequency or volume of fines being sent over time.

2. **Middle layer - "Insert Fine Notification"**: Shows flowing connections between the top and bottom layers, depicted with curved lines in light pink/red coloring.

3. **Bottom layer - "Send for Credit Collection"**: Contains red/pink flowing elements that appear to represent cases that have progressed to the credit collection stage.

The flow lines connecting these layers indicate how cases move through the system - from initial fine issuance, through notification processes, to eventual credit collection. The varying thickness and intensity of the flows suggest different volumes of cases moving between stages at different time periods.

The time axis spans from January 25, 2000 to April 24, 2013, allowing viewers to see how the pattern and volume of this process has changed over more than a decade. The visualization effectively shows both the overall process flow and temporal patterns in what appears to be a fine or penalty management system.
