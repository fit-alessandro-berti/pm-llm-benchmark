<answer>Here’s the analysis and responses to the prompt:  


### Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model  
1. **R (Receive)  P (Approve)**  
   - Average time: ~25 hours (90000 seconds) with a standard deviation of 1 hour (3600 seconds). The very low standard deviation relative to a relatively long average indicates a rigid, predictable process (but may not reflect claim complexity), suggesting automated, fixed-time approval workflows with minimal variation.  
2. **P (Approve)  N (Notify)**  
   - Average time: 7 days (604800 seconds) with a standard deviation of 2 days (172800 seconds). The extremely long average delay and moderate variation point to inconsistent notification timing, likely caused by resource bottlenecks, staff shortages, or prioritization issues in the notification step.  
3. **A (Assign)  C (Close)**  
   - Average time: 2 hours with a notable absence of intermediate steps (e.g., Evaluate, Approve). This suggests premature claim closures without completing core process stages, implying issues with tracking completeness or ad - hoc shortcuts for certain claims.  
4. **E (Evaluate)  N (Notify)**  
   - Average time: 5 minutes, which is unusually short. This suggests a skipped or expedited evaluation step, leading to rapid notification without thorough claim assessment.  


### Hypotheses for Anomalies  
1. For **R  P anomaly**: Automated approval processes (e.g., daily batch processing) enforce strict timelines, causing consistent but long delays, regardless of claim specificities or adjuster workloads.  
2. For **P  N anomaly**: Notification relies on limited or slow resources (e.g., manual confirmation for high - volume claims), creating variable delays and backlog.  
3. For **A  C anomaly**: Some claims bypass evaluate/approve stages due to low priority, profit decisions, or simplified severity assessments, leading to skipping necessary process checks.  
4. For **E  N anomaly**: Expedited evaluations for routine claims skip full assessment, allowing quick notification but potentially compromising accuracy due to lean processes.  


### Verification SQL Queries  
1. **Identify claims with R  P time outside expected range** (±3 standard deviations from average 90000s, stdev 3600s):  
```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    customer_id, 
    claim_type, 
    adjuster_name
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id, 
        ce1.customer_id, 
        c.claim_type, 
        a.name as adjuster_name,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) as duration_seconds
    FROM 
        claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
        AND ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
    JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ce1.resource
) sub
WHERE 
    duration_seconds NOT BETWEEN 90000 - 3*3600 AND 90000 + 3*3600;
```  

2. **Correlate anomalies with adjusters (to check if specific adjusters cause deviations)**:  
```sql
SELECT 
    a.name as adjuster_name, 
    COUNT(*) as anomalous_claims
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    AND ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ce1.resource
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) NOT BETWEEN 90000 - 3*3600 AND 90000 + 3*3600
GROUP BY 
    a.name
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 0;
```  

3. **Find claims closed immediately after assignment (A  C too short, skipping Evaluate/Approve)**:  
```sql
SELECT 
    ce.claim_id, 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.claim_type, 
    a.name as adjuster_name
FROM 
    claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ce.resource
WHERE 
    EXIST (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce2 
        WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id 
            AND ce2.activity = 'A'
            AND ce.activity = 'C'
            AND (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) < 3600  -- Shorter than average (1 hour)
    )
AND ce.activity = 'C'
AND ce.activity <> 'A';
```  

4. **Identify P  N excessively long duration (> average 604800s ± stdev 172800s)**:  
```sql
SELECT 
    ce.claim_id, 
    c.customer_id, 
    a.name as approver_name, 
    n.name as notifier_name,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) as p_to_n_duration_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    AND ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ce1.resource
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800 + 172800;  -- Delay longer than avg + stdev
```  


These queries help isolate anomalous claims, link them to specific adjusters or customer segments, and validate hypotheses about process inefficiencies or shortcuts.
