The two logs make it painfully clear where unfair advantage creeps into the process:

1. Group A (Protected Group)  
   – No one ever receives a “+5” boost; all candidates stand or fall on their raw Skill, Personality and CulturalFit scores.  
   – Of the three cases, P001 and P003 are hired (they have the highest combined unadjusted fit), P002 is not.

2. Group B (Unprotected Group)  
   – Candidates who belong to the LocalBusinessLeadersClub get a +5 “Association Boost” added to their CulturalFit score at two stages.  
   – U001 and U003 both have identical or even slightly lower raw scores than some in Group A, but the +5 bump pushes their final fit into the “hired” range.  
   – U002, who is exactly the same on raw scores but has no association, is not hired.

Which log exhibits bias?  
• Group B is biased. It systematically inflates the CulturalFit of unprotectedgroup candidates with a particular affiliation—an irrelevant credential—so that they outcompete equally qualified (or even more qualified) members of the protected group.  

How the bias manifests:  
• Disparate treatment: only Group B gets the +5 adjustment.  
• Score inflation: raw fit scores of 60 become 65, 58 become 63—enough to swing hiring decisions.  
• Outcome distortion: two Group B applicants with marginally weaker unadjusted profiles beat out Group A applicants who had no chance to receive the same boost.

Implications for fairness and equity:  
• Candidates in the protected group never see the same boost, so the process is not blind or meritocratic.  
• Hiring quotas will skew in favor of those who have the “right” club membership rather than true job fit.  
• You open yourself to legal and reputational risk if nonjobrelated factors drive decisions.  

In a fair system, every candidate’s fit should be assessed by the same criteria, without adhoc score boosts tied to affiliations that correlate with nonprotected status. Removing the “Association Boost” or applying any adjustment equally across groups is essential to restore equity to the process.
