Group B (the “Unprotected” log) clearly exhibits bias.  Here’s how it shows up, step by step:

1. No association boost in Group A  
   - All candidates in Group A are evaluated solely on skilltest score, personality score and a “raw” culturalfit score.  
   - Final hiring decisions line up with those three job-relevant metrics: P001 and P003 (the highestscoring candidates) are hired; P002 is not.  

2. Association-based boost in Group B  
   - Any candidate who belongs to the LocalBusinessLeadersClub receives a +5 point adjustment to their cultural-fit score (applied at CulturalFitCheck and again at FinalInterview).  
   - U001 and U003 both belong to the Club, so their cultural-fit scores jump by 5—even though their raw scores are lower than or equal to those of non-members.  
   - As a result U003 (75 skill, 65 personality, 58 raw fit  63 adjusted fit) is hired over U002 (78 skill, 70 personality, 60 fit) despite having lower core scores.  

3. Why this is biased  
   - The +5 “association boost” has no direct bearing on job performance yet systematically privileges those who happen to belong to a particular club.  
   - Candidates with equal or better raw qualifications (e.g. U002, and especially P002 in Group A) are passed over solely because they lack that membership.  
   - Access to that club may correlate with wealth, connections or other socio-economic factors, creating indirect discrimination against anyone who cannot—or does not choose to—join.  

4. Implications for fairness and equity  
   - Decisions are no longer meritocratic: an extraneous credential (Club membership) overrides actual ability and fit.  
   - This sort of hidden bias can exacerbate workplace homogeneity, undermine diversity goals, and expose the organization to legal or reputational risk.  
   - A fair process would strip out non-job-related boosts, or at least validate that “association” really predicts on-the-job success and is equally accessible to all candidates.  

By contrast, Group A’s log applies only job-relevant criteria (skill, personality, cultural fit) with no hidden perks—and so does not display this form of bias. Removing or rigorously justifying the +5 association adjustment is the first step toward restoring equity in the hiring funnel.
