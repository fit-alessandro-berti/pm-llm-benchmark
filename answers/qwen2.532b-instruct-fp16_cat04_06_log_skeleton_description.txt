Based on the given activity occurrences and directly-follows constraints, it seems we are looking at a workflow related to declaration processing for payment requests. The process involves several roles: Employee, Supervisor, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, Administration, and Missing (likely an internal system or status). Here is a general outline of how this process might work:

1. **Initial Declaration**:
   - An employee can save ('Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE') or directly submit ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', though it's not listed in the occurrences) their declaration.
   
2. **Pre-Approval Process**:
   - The declaration is sent for pre-approval: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER').
   - If rejected at this stage, it can be sent back to the employee ('Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' followed by 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' or 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR').

3. **Budget Owner Review**:
   - If not rejected by the pre-approver, the declaration goes to the Budget Owner for approval ('Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER').
   
4. **Supervisor Review**:
   - After budget owner’s approval or if directly from pre-approval, it moves to the supervisor for further review and possible final approval: 
     - Final Approval ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), which can lead to payment requests.
     - Rejection ('Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR').

5. **Administration Review**:
   - If approved by the Supervisor or directly from pre-approval, it goes for administration review and approval: 
     - Administration approves the declaration ('Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION').
     - Possible rejection at this stage ('Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION') which can be followed by a resubmission to pre-approver.

6. **Payment Handling**:
   - Once approved through all stages, it moves towards payment handling: 
     - Payment Requested ('Request Payment'), followed by 'Payment Handled'.

7. **Rejected Declarations and Revisions**:
   - Throughout the process, if a declaration is rejected at any point (by PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR) or marked as missing information (by MISSING), it may return to an earlier stage for revision ('Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' or 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', etc.).

8. **Final Review and Closure**:
   - Once a declaration is finalized and payment handled, the process closes unless further revisions are required due to rejections.

### Example Sequence of Events:

1. Employee saves or submits a declaration.
2. Declaration moves for pre-approval.
3. If passed, goes to budget owner for approval; if rejected, back to employee for revision.
4. Approved declarations move to supervisor for final review/approval; if not approved by Supervisor, it can be sent back or rejected.
5. If approved by supervisor, then goes to administration for the final approval stage.
6. Once all approvals are given and any necessary revisions completed, a payment request is made followed by the handling of the payment.

This process ensures that declarations go through various checkpoints ensuring accuracy in financial documentation before payment can be processed.
