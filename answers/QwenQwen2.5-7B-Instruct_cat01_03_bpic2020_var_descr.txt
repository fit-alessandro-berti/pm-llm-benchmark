The data describes a series of process variants for handling declaration submissions and subsequent payments. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the underlying process:

### Main Parts of the Process

1. **Declaration Submission**: The process starts when an employee (`EMPLOYEE`) submits a declaration.
2. **Approval Stages**:
   - **Initial Approval**: The declaration can be reviewed and approved by:
     - **ADMINISTRATION**: This can be the first step or can occur before a more specific approval.
     - **BUDGET OWNER**: This is an additional step that can be required.
     - **PRE_APPROVER**: This is a separate approver before the final one.
     - **SUPERVISOR**: This is a final approval.
   - **Rejection Stages**:
     - At each step, the declaration can be rejected by the reviewer, leading to resubmission and subsequent re-pricing.
3. **Final Approval and Payment Handling**: Once the declaration reaches the final approver (`SUPERVISOR`), and depending on the previous steps, a payment is requested and, if successful, handled.

### Variants of the Process

1. **Basic Flow (Version 1)**:
   - `Declaration Submitted by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration Approved by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 4618
   - **Performance (in units)**: 810187.903

2. **Basic Flow (Version 2)**:
   - `Declaration Submitted by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration Approved by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration Approved by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 2473
   - **Performance (in units)**: 1084338.407

3. **Alternative Route**:
   - `Declaration Submitted by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration Approved by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 575
   - **Performance (in units)**: 861058.409

4. **Handling of Rejections**:
   - Different flows exist for handling rejections and re-submissions, including:
     - `Declaration Submitted by EMPLOYEE -> Approved by ADMINISTRATION -> Rejected by SUPERVISOR -> Rejected by EMPLOYEE -> Resubmitted -> RESUBMITTED -> Approved by ADMINISTRATION -> Final Appproved by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
     - `Declaration Submitted by EMPLOYEE -> Approved by ADMINISTRATION -> Rejected by ADMINISTRATION -> Rejected by EMPLOYEE -> RE-RESUBMITTED -> Approved by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - For each of these paths, the number of rejections and resubmissions can vary, influencing the frequency and performance metrics.

5. **Special Cases and Invalidations**:
   - `Declaration Submitted by EMPLOYEE -> REQUEST Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 134, performance = 0.000)` - This likely indicates a case where the declaration was saved without any further processing.
   - `Declaration Submitted by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> REQUEST Payment -> REQUEST Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 5, performance = 13805869.200)` - This variant shows a complex rejection cycle before handling the payment.

### Summary of Variants

- **Initial Approvals**: Ranges from being solely by `ADMINISTRATION` to requiring multiple levels of approval (`ADMINISTRATION`, `BUDGET OWNER`, `SUPERVISOR`).
- **Branching Logic**: For rejections, the process can have multiple branches and retries, often involving re-submission stages.
- **Final Approvals and Payment**: Depend on the initial and intermediate approvals, with `SUPERVISOR` being the definitive final approver.
- **Performance Metrics**: The performance metric likely represents some form of quantitative measure, possibly related to efficiency, cost, or throughput.

This high-level description covers most of the process details, highlighting the complexity and variety in workflows. Each variant captures different patterns of approval and rejection paths, influencing the efficiency and resource allocation.
