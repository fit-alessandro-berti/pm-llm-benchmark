**Analysis of Event Log Deviations from Normative Process**

Based on the provided normative process description and the event log, the following cases deviate from the expected process flow. Below is a detailed analysis of each violating case, including the specific violations and references to the normative rules.

### **Violating Cases Identified: Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5**

---

#### **1. Case 2**

| Timestamp           | Activity          |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order     |
| 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory   |
| 2023-10-06 10:00    | Package items     |
| 2023-10-06 10:30    | Authorize payment |
| 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order        |
| 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order       |

****Violations:**

1. **Packaging Items Before Authorizing Payment**
   - **Normative Reference:** 
     - *"Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging.*
     - *"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.*
   - **Explanation:**
     - In Case 2, the activity sequence proceeds from "Check inventory" directly to "Package items" at **10:00**, followed by "Authorize payment" at **10:30**.
     - **Violation:** Packaging occurs **before** payment authorization, which contradicts the normative rule that payment must be authorized prior to packaging.

#### **2. Case 3**

| Timestamp           | Activity          |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order     |
| 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory   |
| 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment |
| 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order      |
| 2023-10-07 10:30    | Ship order        |
| 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order       |

****Violations:**

1. **Authorizing Payment Despite Insufficient Inventory**
   - **Normative Reference:**
     - *If inventory is insufficient, the process should branch into a cancellation scenario directly after "Check inventory".*
     - *"Authorize payment" should only occur after confirming inventory sufficiency.*
   - **Explanation:**
     - In Case 3, after "Check inventory" at **09:20**, the process proceeds to "Authorize payment" at **09:40** before determining that the inventory is insufficient.
     - **Violation:** Payment authorization occurs **before** recognizing insufficient inventory, whereas the normative process dictates that cancellation should proceed directly without authorizing payment.

2. **Shipping Order After Cancellation**
   - **Normative Reference:**
     - *"Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation.*
   - **Explanation:**
     - Following "Cancel order" at **10:00**, the process incorrectly proceeds to "Ship order" at **10:30**.
     - **Violation:** Shipping occurs **after** the order has been canceled, which is inconsistent with the normative rule that fulfillment activities should not follow cancellation.

---

#### **3. Case 5**

| Timestamp           | Activity         |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order    |
| 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory  |
| 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment|
| 2023-10-09 11:00    | Ship order       |
| 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order      |

****Violations:**

1. **Ship Order Occurs Before Packaging Items**
   - **Normative Reference:**
     - *"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.*
     - *The expected sequence is: Authorize Payment → Package Items → Ship Order.*
   - **Explanation:**
     - In Case 5, the process moves from "Authorize payment" at **10:30** directly to "Ship order" at **11:00**, omitting the "Package items" activity.
     - **Violation:** The absence of "Package items" means that shipping is initiated **before** packaging, violating the required order of activities.

---

### **Summary of Deviations**

- **Case 2:** Packaging items before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3:** 
  - Authorizing payment despite insufficient inventory.
  - Shipping order after cancellation.
- **Case 5:** Shipping order without packaging items.

These deviations represent breaches of the normative process rules, specifically concerning the correct sequencing and conditional flow of activities based on inventory status.
