1. How does the R&D team balance innovation (new features and materials) with downstream manufacturability, reliability, and supplier feasibility across multiple countries?

2. What criteria determine the choice of suppliers for critical components (e.g., processors, OLED screens), and how does the company avoid over-dependence on single-source or single-region suppliers?

3. How are supplier lead times, defect rates, and contractual terms incorporated into demand planning and production scheduling—especially when market demand shifts suddenly?

4. What early-warning indicators does the company track to detect supply disruptions (geopolitical risk, port congestion, factory yield issues), and how are mitigation plans triggered?

5. How does the organization quantify and manage the trade-off between just-in-time replenishment (lower inventory) and resilience (buffer stock) in high-demand regions?

6. What are the most common quality issues found during assembly and diagnostic testing, and how are those issues traced back to specific suppliers, batches, or process steps?

7. How does the Malaysia assembly plant optimize throughput and quality across 24/7 shifts while minimizing worker fatigue, turnover, and safety incidents?

8. In what ways does automation improve consistency and speed, and where does it introduce new risks (e.g., brittle processes, maintenance downtime, skills gaps)?

9. How are packaging choices (materials, size, protection level) evaluated for cost, damage rates, sustainability goals, and compliance across different jurisdictions?

10. What factors drive the decision to use air freight versus sea freight for particular markets, and how does the company measure the full cost impact (including carbon footprint and risk)?

11. How does customs and regulatory compliance complexity influence routing decisions, inventory placement, and product configuration (e.g., labeling, chargers, radio certifications)?

12. What data governance practices ensure that purchase orders, invoices, customs declarations, and production data remain accurate and consistent across systems and partners?

13. How are forecasts generated and validated across regions, and how does the company handle biases from promotions, product launches, or competitor actions?

14. What mechanisms exist to reconcile differences between planned vs. actual demand, production yield, and logistics performance—and how quickly can plans be revised?

15. How does the company decide optimal inventory positioning (supplier hubs, in-transit stock, regional distribution centers, retail safety stock) to balance service levels and working capital?

16. What are the biggest bottlenecks in the end-to-end lead time (supplier production, international transport, customs clearance, warehouse processing), and which are most cost-effective to improve?

17. How does the organization manage currency fluctuations and payment terms across suppliers and regions, and what strategies reduce financial volatility?

18. When product recalls or warranty issues arise, how does the company trace affected units, communicate with customers and regulators, and minimize brand damage and cost?

19. How are environmental and labor regulations verified across the supplier network, and what is the escalation process if non-compliance is discovered?

20. What KPIs best capture both efficiency and resilience (e.g., OTIF, yield, forecast accuracy, cash-to-cash cycle, emissions), and how are they used to drive continuous improvement without unintended consequences?
