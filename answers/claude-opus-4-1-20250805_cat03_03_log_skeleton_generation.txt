Based on the order fulfillment process described, I'll construct a Log Skeleton that captures the business logic and constraints of this warehouse management system.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'D'),  # Every received order must be dispatched (and vice versa)
        ('PI', 'PO'),  # Every picked item must be packed (and vice versa)
    },
    
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),  # Check availability must come after receive order
        ('RI', 'CA'),  # Reserve items must come after checking availability
        ('PI', 'RI'),  # Pick items must come after reserving them
        ('QC', 'PI'),  # Quality check must come after picking items
        ('PO', 'QC'),  # Pack order must come after quality check
        ('GSL', 'PO'),  # Generate shipping label must come after packing
        ('D', 'GSL'),  # Dispatch must come after generating shipping label
        ('IC', 'D'),  # Invoice customer must come after dispatch
        ('RP', 'IC'),  # Record payment must come after invoicing
    },
    
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # After receiving order, must check availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # After checking availability, must reserve items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # After reserving, must pick items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # After picking, must do quality check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # After quality check, must pack
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # After packing, must generate shipping label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # After generating label, must dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),  # After dispatch, must invoice customer
    },
    
    'never_together': {
        # No activities are mutually exclusive in this process
    },
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},      # Receive order occurs exactly once
        'CA': {1},      # Check availability occurs exactly once
        'RI': {1},      # Reserve items occurs exactly once
        'PI': {1},      # Pick items occurs exactly once
        'QC': {1},      # Quality check occurs exactly once
        'PO': {1},      # Pack order occurs exactly once
        'GSL': {1},     # Generate shipping label occurs exactly once
        'D': {1},       # Dispatch occurs exactly once
        'IC': {1},      # Invoice customer occurs exactly once
        'RP': {0, 1},   # Record payment may or may not occur (customer might not pay yet)
    },
    
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),   # Receive order directly followed by check availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),   # Check availability directly followed by reserve items
        ('RI', 'PI'),   # Reserve items directly followed by pick items
        ('PI', 'QC'),   # Pick items directly followed by quality check
        ('QC', 'PO'),   # Quality check directly followed by pack order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Pack order directly followed by generate shipping label
        ('GSL', 'D'),   # Generate shipping label directly followed by dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),    # Dispatch directly followed by invoice customer
    }
}
```

This Log Skeleton represents a linear order fulfillment process where:

1. Each order follows a strict sequence from receipt through dispatch and invoicing
2. Most activities occur exactly once per order (except payment recording which is optional)
3. The process enforces a clear workflow with direct succession between activities
4. The equivalence constraints ensure that every received order gets dispatched, and every picked order gets packed
5. The always_before and always_after constraints maintain the logical sequence of operations
6. The directly_follows constraints indicate that this is a streamlined process without intermediate activities between the main steps
