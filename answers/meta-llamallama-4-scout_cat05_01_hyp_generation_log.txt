## Step 1: Identify Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors
To identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the given event log, we need to analyze the sequence of events for each case_id and compare them against the assumed normal process flow.

## Step 2: Analyze Case 1001
Case 1001 follows the normal process flow:
1. Register Order
2. Perform Credit Check
3. Validate Stock
4. Confirm Shipment
5. Ship Goods
6. Issue Invoice
7. Receive Payment

No anomalies detected.

## Step 3: Analyze Case 1002
Case 1002 does not follow the normal process flow:
1. Register Order
2. Confirm Shipment
3. Ship Goods
4. Perform Credit Check
5. Validate Stock
6. Issue Invoice
7. Receive Payment

Anomaly detected: Credit Check and Validate Stock happened after Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods.

## Step 4: Analyze Case 1003
Case 1003 does not follow the normal process flow:
1. Register Order
2. Perform Credit Check
3. Ship Goods
4. Issue Invoice
5. Confirm Shipment
6. Receive Payment

Anomaly detected: Confirm Shipment happened after Issue Invoice.

## Step 5: Analyze Case 1004
Case 1004 does not follow the normal process flow:
1. Register Order
2. Receive Payment
3. Issue Invoice
4. Confirm Shipment
5. Ship Goods

Anomalies detected: Receive Payment happened before Issue Invoice and other activities.

## Step 6: Hypothesize Why Anomalies Might Occur
- Case 1002: Possible causes include system errors, incorrect workflow configuration, or training issues leading to skipping critical steps like credit checks before shipment.
- Case 1003: Possible cause is a system error or manual override that allowed shipment confirmation to occur out of sequence.
- Case 1004: Possible causes include a payment received before processing the order (e.g., advance payment) or a system error allowing financial transactions out of sequence.

## 7: Propose Relevant SQL Queries to Investigate Hypotheses
### Query 1: Retrieve All Cases with Anomalous Sequences
```sql
WITH ranked_events AS (
  SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp,
         LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM ranked_events
WHERE (activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND prev_activity NOT IN ('Validate Stock', 'Perform Credit Check'))
   OR (activity = 'Ship Goods' AND prev_activity NOT IN ('Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment'))
   OR (activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND prev_activity NOT IN ('Ship Goods', 'Confirm Shipment'))
   OR (activity = 'Receive Payment' AND prev_activity NOT IN ('Issue Invoice'));
```

### Query 2: Investigate Credit Check Anomalies
```sql
SELECT case_id, event_id, timestamp, additional_info
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
  AND (CASE 
         WHEN LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) != 'Register Order' THEN TRUE 
       END);
```

### Query 3: Examine Payment and Invoice Sequence
```sql
SELECT o.case_id, o.order_value, 
       MIN(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN oel.timestamp END) AS payment_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN oel.timestamp END) AS invoice_time
FROM orders o
JOIN order_event_log oel ON o.case_id = oel.case_id
GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_value
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN oel.timestamp END) 
       < MIN(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN oel.timestamp END);
```

### Query 4: Resource and Role Analysis for Anomalous Cases
```sql
SELECT oel.case_id, oel.resource, r.role, r.department
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE oel.case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) != COUNT(activity)  -- Detect duplicate activities
);
```

## Conclusion
The identified anomalies suggest potential issues with workflow management, system configurations, or operational procedures. Further investigation using the proposed SQL queries can help uncover the root causes of these anomalies.
