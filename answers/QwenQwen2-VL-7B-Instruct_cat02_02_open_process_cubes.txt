Process cubes are a data analysis technique used in multi-dimensional process mining to identify patterns and trends in complex processes. They differ from traditional process mining approaches in that they use a cube-based approach to organize and analyze data, rather than a sequential or event-based approach. 

In traditional process mining, data is analyzed by examining individual events and their relationships to identify patterns and trends. This is useful for identifying specific processes or events within a process, but it can be difficult to identify broader patterns or trends across multiple processes or events.

Process cubes, on the other hand, use a multidimensional approach to organize and analyze data. They group related data into cubes, which are essentially tables that contain multiple dimensions of data, such as time, location, and resource. By analyzing these cubes, it is possible to identify broader patterns and trends across multiple processes or events, as well as to compare and contrast different processes or events.

For example, in a manufacturing process, a process cube might group data by product type, production line, and stage of production. By analyzing this cube, it is possible to identify trends in production efficiency, such as which products are taking longer to manufacture, or which production lines are more efficient than others.

Overall, process cubes are a powerful tool for multi-dimensional process mining, as they provide a way to organize and analyze complex data in a way that is both comprehensive and insightful.
