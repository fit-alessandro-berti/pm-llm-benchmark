I'll analyze each case and identify violations based on the normative process description:

**Case 1:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close
Status: Compliant
This case follows the ideal "happy path" exactly as described in the normative process.

**Case 2:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close
Status: Non-compliant
Violation: Package items occurs before payment authorization. The normative process clearly states that payment authorization must occur before packaging can begin.

**Case 3:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close
Status: Non-compliant
Multiple violations:
1. After cancellation, shipping should not occur (the description explicitly states this is not allowed)
2. The process shows both authorization and cancellation, which is inconsistent with the branching logic described
3. Shipping occurs without a packaging step

**Case 4:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close
Status: Compliant
This case follows the proper cancellation path as described when inventory is insufficient.

**Case 5:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close
Status: Non-compliant
Violation: The "Package items" step is missing between authorization and shipping. The description clearly states that packaging must occur before shipping.

**Summary of Key Violations:**

1. **Case 2** violates the sequence constraint requiring payment authorization before packaging.

2. **Case 3** has multiple serious violations:
   - Shipping after cancellation (explicitly forbidden)
   - Mixed cancellation and fulfillment activities
   - Missing packaging step
   
3. **Case 5** violates the requirement for packaging before shipping.

**Interpretation of Ambiguities:**
While the normative description leaves some room for interpretation, I've based my analysis on these key principles:
1. The sequence must be logical and consistent (either fulfillment OR cancellation path)
2. Explicit constraints in the description (like no shipping after cancellation) must be strictly followed
3. Required steps (like packaging before shipping) cannot be skipped
4. The branching logic (sufficient vs. insufficient inventory) should lead to either the complete fulfillment path or the cancellation path, not a mix of both.

These interpretations help resolve ambiguities while maintaining the integrity of the process as described.
