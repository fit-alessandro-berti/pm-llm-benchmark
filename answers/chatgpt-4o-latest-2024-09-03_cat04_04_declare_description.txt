The **DECLARE model** you've shared represents a **declarative process** where the activities and their relationships are governed by various constraints, instead of by an explicitly defined step-by-step procedure in a flowchart or workflow. This allows for flexibility while still enforcing certain rules.

#### Context Overview

This process appears to pertain to **internal approval of declarations and handling payments**, with activities such as submitting a declaration, approving or rejecting it, and managing payments. Several different entities are involved in the process (e.g., EMPLOYEE, SUPERVISOR), and various restrictions regulate how and when certain activities should be carried out. These restrictions are captured using **constraint types** like **existence**, **response**, **precedence**, **succession**, and **absence**, etc. Here's an overview of the important aspects:

---

### Key Activities
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: The employee submits the initial request/declaration.
2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: The supervisor gives final approval to the employee's declaration.
3. **Request Payment**: After the supervisor's approval, a payment needs to be requested for the subject matter of the declaration.
4. **Payment Handled**: After the payment request, the payment is processed.
5. **Absences of Rejected or Intermediate Approval Activities**: Various intermediate approvals or rejections (e.g., by ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER) are **absent**, indicating these pathways are not possible in this process.

### Constraints Govern the Process

#### 1. **Existence Constraints**
- The following activities **must happen at least once** during any trace of the process:
    - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
    - `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`
    - `Request Payment`
    - `Payment Handled`

This essentially describes the core flow of the process: submission  approval  payment request  payment processing.

#### 2. **Exactly One Execution**
- It is ensured that critical activities are executed **exactly once** in each process trace:
    - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
    - `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`
    - `Request Payment`
    - `Payment Handled`

There cannot be multiple submissions or repeated approvals, requests, or payments in any execution trace. This might be because the process concerns a specific declaration that follows a strict sequential workflow without redoing steps.

#### 3. **Initialization**
- The process **always starts** with `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`. This affirms that the first step is always an employee initiating the process by submitting a declaration.

#### 4. **Responded Existence**
- Whenever certain activities happen, others must also happen at some point:
    - If `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` occurs, `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` must also occur.
    - If `Request Payment` occurs, `Payment Handled` must eventually occur.
    - If `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` occurs, `Request Payment` must also occur.

These constraints ensure that submitted declarations must lead to final approval (by the supervisor), and payment requests or declarations follow suit with the handling of payment.

#### 5. **Precedence/Chain Precedence Constraints**
- Certain activities have to happen **before** others:
    - `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` must precede both `Request Payment` and `Payment Handled`. 
    - `Request Payment` must precede `Payment Handled`.
    - The relationship between these two is further strengthened by **chain** precedence, i.e., whenever `Request Payment` occurs, it **directly follows** `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`. Similarly, `Payment Handled` **directly follows** `Request Payment`.

#### 6. **Response / Chain Response Constraints**
- Once certain activities happen, others must follow **in the future of the trace**:
    - `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` must lead to `Payment Handled`.
    - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` must trigger `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` and eventually lead to `Request Payment` and then `Payment Handled`.
    - Strengthened by **chain response**, if `Request Payment` is made, the next immediate step must be `Payment Handled`.

#### 7. **Succession Constraints**
- There's a tight coupling between certain activities, meaning:
    - If `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` happens, it should always be followed by `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, eventually leading to `Request Payment` and `Payment Handled`.
    - **Alternate succession**, further specifying no other activities are allowed to intervene between these steps.

#### 8. **Absence of Intermediate/Rejected States**
- A number of activities are strictly prohibited from occurring in this process (due to the **absence** constraints):
    - Various activities such as rejection by different actors (SUPERVISOR, EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION) and intermediate states (e.g., `FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER`) are absent. 
    - This indicates that once a declaration is submitted, the only possible path is final approval by the supervisor, followed by a request for payment and handling of the payment. Any rejections or intermediate steps are not part of the process.

#### 9. **Co-Existence**
- Some activities are **mutually dependent**, meaning if one happens, the other must also happen:
    - For instance, if `Request Payment` occurs, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` and `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` must also occur, ensuring that these activities are part of the same process cycle.

### Process Workflow Summary

1. **Start**: 
   - The process is **initiated by an employee** submitting a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

2. **Approval**:
   - The process proceeds towards obtaining **final approval from the supervisor** (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).

3. **Request Payment**:
   - Once the declaration is approved, a **payment request is made** (`Request Payment`).

4. **Payment Execution**:
   - The process completes when **the payment is handled** (`Payment Handled`).

This is the primary flow of the process. No activities like **rejection** by various actors, or intermediate approval stages, are allowed as per the **absence constraints**.

The constraints outlined ensure that the process follows a **linear, strict, and well-defined path** from submission to approval, payment request, and final payment, with no optional or alternate paths (e.g., rejections or partial approvals).
