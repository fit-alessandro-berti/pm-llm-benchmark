Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative rules and the desiderata for the loan application process. The user provided an event log with three cases, and I need to check each against the given constraints and recommendations.

Starting with Part 1: Normative Process Behavior. The key is to ensure the sequence of activities is strictly followed. Let's look at each case one by one.

Case 1:
- Application Received (10:00)
- Credit Check (9:30)
- Risk Assessment (10:00)
- Loan Decision (11:00)
- Inform Applicant (13:00)
- Finalize Documentation (13:30)
- Close Case (14:00)

Sequence looks correct. Credit Check before Risk Assessment, then Loan Decision, then Inform Applicant. Since it's approved, Finalize Documentation comes before Close Case. No issues here. So Case 1 is compliant.

Case 2:
- Application Received (8:00)
- Risk Assessment (8:20)  This is a problem because the Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So this is a violation of the normative rules. The order is wrong here. Even though later there's a Credit Check, the Risk Assessment was done before the Credit Check. The normative rules state that Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment. So this is a violation.

Then, after Risk Assessment, Credit Check is done. Then Loan Decision (Rejected). Then Finalize Documentation (which is not allowed after rejection). So even though the Credit Check is after Risk Assessment, the main violation is the order of Risk Assessment before Credit Check. Also, Finalize Documentation after rejection is not allowed. So Case 2 has two violations: incorrect sequence and Finalize after rejection.

Case 3:
- Application Received (9:00)
- Credit Check (14:00)  This is more than 24 hours later. The desideratum says Credit Check should be within 24 hours. So this is a desideratum violation, not a normative one. But the normative rule is that Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment. Then Risk Assessment is next, then Loan Decision (Approved). Then Inform Applicant is at 16:00, which is later than the recommended 48 hours. So that's a desideratum violation. Also, after the loan decision, they inform the applicant, then finalize documentation, then close case. Since it's approved, Finalize Documentation should be before Close Case. So that's correct. But the timing of the Inform Applicant is after the recommended 48 hours. So that's a desideratum violation. Also, there's no Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum.

Now, moving to Part 2: Desiderata. These are not strict rules but recommended practices. So for Case 2, the Credit Check is done after Risk Assessment, but the desideratum is that Credit Check should be done within 24 hours. However, in Case 2, the Credit Check is done at 9:00, which is 10 minutes after the Risk Assessment. Wait, the application was received at 8:00, then Risk Assessment at 8:20, then Credit Check at 9:00. So that's within 24 hours. But the problem is that the Risk Assessment was done before the Credit Check, which is a normative violation. But for desiderata, the timing of the Credit Check is okay. However, the desideratum about the Credit Check being within 24 hours is not violated here. Wait, the desideratum says that the Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours after the application is received. So in Case 2, the Credit Check is done at 9:00, which is 1 hour after the application was received. So that's within 24 hours. So that's okay. But the main issue is the order. But the desideratum is about timing, not order. So the main desideratum violations are for Case 3: Credit Check is done 5 days after the application, which is a desideratum violation. Also, the Inform Applicant is done 5 days after the decision, which is after the 48-hour recommendation. Also, no Follow-up Call.

So for the desiderata, Case 3 has two desideratum violations: Credit Check after 24 hours and Inform Applicant after 48 hours. Case 2's Credit Check is within 24 hours, so that's okay. But the main issue is the normative violation.

Now, the user's task is to identify which cases are violating normative rules and which are failing desiderata.

So for Case 2: Normative violation because Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check. Also, Finalize Documentation after rejection is not allowed. So two normative violations.

Case 3: No normative violations, but two desideratum violations.

Case 1: No violations in either normative or desiderata.

Now, for the answer, I need to explain each case.

For Case 2, the first activity is Risk Assessment before Credit Check, which is a normative violation. Also, Finalize Documentation after rejection is another violation. So both are normative.

For Case 3, the Credit Check is done more than 24 hours after application, which is a desideratum violation. Also, the Inform Applicant is done after 48 hours, which is another desideratum violation. No normative violations.

So that's the breakdown.

### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules**  
**Case 2**  
- **Violation 1:** **Incorrect Sequence**  
  - **Activity:** Risk Assessment (8:20) is performed **before** Credit Check (9:00).  
  - **Normative Rule:** Credit Check must occur **before** Risk Assessment. This violates the strict sequence requirement.  
- **Violation 2:** **Finalize Documentation After Rejection**  
  - **Activity:** Finalize Documentation (10:00) is done **after** the Loan Decision (Rejected) is made.  
  - **Normative Rule:** If the loan is rejected, documentation must **not** be finalized before closing the case.  

**Case 3**  
- **No Normative Violations:**  
  - Credit Check occurs **before** Risk Assessment (14:00  14:00), and the sequence of activities (Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case) is strictly followed.  
  - Finalize Documentation is done **before** Close Case (17:00  10:00), which is correct for an approved loan.

### **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**  
**Case 2**  
- **No Desideratum Violations:**  
  - Credit Check occurs **within 24 hours** of the application (8:00  9:00).  
  - No mention of a Follow-up Call, but this is **not a violation** (desiderata are not strict).  

**Case 3**  
- **Violation 1:** **Delayed Credit Check**  
  - Credit Check occurs **5 days** (14:00) after the application was received (9:00).  
  - **Desideratum:** Credit Check should be completed **within 24 hours** of application receipt.  
- **Violation 2:** **Delayed Applicant Notification**  
  - Inform Applicant occurs **5 days** (16:00) after the loan decision (14:00).  
  - **Desideratum:** Applicant should be informed **within 48 hours** of the decision.  
- **Violation 3:** **No Follow-up Call**  
  - No Follow-up Call is recorded, though this is **not a critical violation** (desideratum).  

---

### **3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors**  
**Case 2:**  
- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:**  
  - This is a **serious normative violation**. The process must strictly follow the sequence: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment. Performing Risk Assessment first is a logical error and invalidates the entire workflow.  
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection:**  
  - This is a **direct violation** of the rule that documentation must not be finalized after a rejection. It could lead to incorrect records and confusion.  

**Case 3:**  
- **Delayed Credit Check:**  
  - While not a strict rule, this is a **desideratum violation**. Delaying the Credit Check may affect the accuracy of the risk assessment and could lead to inefficiencies.  
- **Delayed Applicant Notification:**  
  - Though not a strict rule, this is a **suboptimal practice**. Prompt communication is critical for customer satisfaction and trust.  
- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  - This is a **non-critical desideratum violation**. While not required, a follow-up call can help ensure alignment with the applicant and improve the overall process.

### **Summary**  
- **Normative Violations:**  
  - **Case 2** (2 violations: incorrect sequence, finalize after rejection).  
- **Desideratum Violations:**  
  - **Case 3** (2 desideratum violations: delayed credit check, delayed notification).  
- **Compliant Cases:**  
  - **Case 1** (no violations in either normative or desiderata).
