Explanation of the added anti-bias constraints
1. existence(BiasMitigationCheck)  
   • Guarantees that every loan-application case includes an explicit activity devoted to bias mitigation.

2. coexistence(CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview)  
   • Ensures that whenever an applicant’s race is inspected, the case is also manually reviewed, adding human oversight; likewise, ManualReview cannot occur without a preceding race check (symmetry of coexistence).

3. response(CheckApplicantRace  BiasMitigationCheck)  
   • Forces a BiasMitigationCheck sometime after the sensitive attribute is examined, preventing the process from “forgetting” to run the automated fairness routine.

4. precedence(BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision)  
   • Makes it impossible to reach any FinalDecision (Approve or Reject) unless a BiasMitigationCheck has already been carried out, so decisions are taken only after mitigation has been considered.

5. nonchainsuccession(CheckApplicantRace  FinalDecision)  
   • Blocks the sensitive attribute inspection from being immediately followed by the final decision, preventing snap judgments based directly on protected characteristics.

Together, these declarative rules inject explicit checks and secondary reviews between sensitive-attribute handling and the ultimate outcome, reducing the risk that loan decisions are driven—consciously or unconsciously—by discriminatory bias.
