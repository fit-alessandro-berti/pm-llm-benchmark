## 1. Identified Anomalies

Upon analyzing the provided DECLARE model, the following anomalies and contradictions have been identified:

- **Contradiction between `precedence` and `noncoexistence`:**  
  The `precedence` rule requires that "C (Close Claim)" must be preceded by "R (Receive Claim)". However, the `noncoexistence` rule prohibits "E (Evaluate Claim)" from coexisting with "C". Since evaluation is typically required before closing, this creates a logical contradiction in the process flow.

- **Violation of the standard process flow:**  
  The `existence` of "C (Close Claim)" is mandatory, but there is no guarantee in the constraints that the claims undergo key activities, such as assignment ("A") or notification ("N"), before closure.

- **`responded_existence` ambiguity:**  
  The `responded_existence` rule states that "E (Evaluate Claim)" must always have a corresponding "A (Assign Adjuster)". However, there is no guarantee that "A" actually occurs before "E", which undermines the logical sequence.

- **Overly strict `noncoexistence` rule:**  
  The `noncoexistence` rule states that "E (Evaluate Claim)" cannot coexist with "C (Close Claim)", which is problematic since evaluation is expected to precede closing as part of a logical process flow.

- **Absence of required constraints for the full process flow:**  
  For an ideal insurance claims process, there should be constraints guaranteeing all key activities (Receive -> Assign -> Evaluate -> Approve -> Notify -> Close), but parts of the process can be skipped entirely due to missing or overly permissive rules.

## 2. Hypotheses for Potential Causes of Anomalies

Several potential reasons for the identified anomalies are:

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements:**  
   - The DECLARE model may not correctly reflect the intended business process, potentially due to ambiguous or inaccurately documented requirements.

2. **Incremental Policy Changes:**  
   - Rules could have been added or modified over time without ensuring consistency across the entire set of constraints, leading to contradictions and gaps.

3. **Incomplete or Erroneous Data Analysis:**  
   - The constraints may have been derived from incomplete or noisy data, resulting in incorrect assumptions about valid paths in the process.

4. **Operational Pressure:**  
   - To process claims faster, shortcuts in the process may have been allowed in practice, leading to relaxed or contradictory rules in the model.

5. **Lack of Validation during Model Creation:**  
   - The model might not have been rigorously tested for logical consistency, nor mapped against real process execution data to identify discrepancies.

## 3. Verification Approaches: SQL-Based Analysis

To investigate these anomalies, we propose specific SQL queries to be executed on the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables:

---

### a) Checking if Claims are Closed Without Evaluation
To verify if some claims are closed without undergoing evaluation ("E"), use the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_eval ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
WHERE ce_eval.claim_id IS NULL AND ce_close.claim_id IS NOT NULL;
```

This query identifies claims that have a closing activity ("C") but no corresponding evaluation activity ("E").

---

### b) Identifying Traces Where "Evaluation" and "Closing" Coexist
To detect if traces in the `claim_events` table contain both "E (Evaluate)" and "C (Close)", violating the `noncoexistence` rule:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ce1.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'E'
  AND ce2.activity = 'C';
```

This query retrieves claim IDs where both evaluation and closure activities occur, which directly violates the `noncoexistence` rule.

---

### c) Ensuring Assignment Always Occurs Before Evaluation
To verify if adjusters are assigned ("A") before claims are evaluated ("E"), the following query can be used:

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON c.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events ce_evaluate ON c.claim_id = ce_evaluate.claim_id AND ce_evaluate.activity = 'E'
WHERE ce_assign.timestamp > ce_evaluate.timestamp;
```

This query identifies cases where an adjuster was assigned after the evaluation activity, violating the expected precedence of assignment.

---

### d) Checking for Skipped Process Steps (Example: Missing "Notification")
To confirm if any mandatory process steps, such as notification ("N"), are skipped before closing, use the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_notify ON c.claim_id = ce_notify.claim_id AND ce_notify.activity = 'N'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
WHERE ce_close.claim_id IS NOT NULL AND ce_notify.claim_id IS NULL;
```

This query finds claims where a closing activity exists, but no notification was sent to the customer.

---

### e) Verifying if "Assignment" Always Occurs for Evaluated Claims
To check if all claims that underwent evaluation ("E") have an assigned adjuster ("A"):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_evaluate ON c.claim_id = ce_evaluate.claim_id AND ce_evaluate.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON c.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
WHERE ce_evaluate.claim_id IS NOT NULL AND ce_assign.claim_id IS NULL;
```

This query identifies situations where claims have evaluation but no adjuster was assigned, violating the `responded_existence` rule.

---

### f) Ensuring Process Starts with "Receive" and Ends with "Close"
To validate that all claims start with "R (Receive)" and conclude with "C (Close)", the following query checks the first and last activities:

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS first_event, MAX(timestamp) AS last_event
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
) events ON c.claim_id = events.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce_first ON ce_first.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce_first.timestamp = events.first_event
JOIN claim_events ce_last ON ce_last.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce_last.timestamp = events.last_event
WHERE ce_first.activity != 'R' OR ce_last.activity != 'C';
```

This query ensures that the initial activity is always "R" and the final activity is always "C".

These queries can help validate the DECLARE model against real-world process data and identify discrepancies or compliance issues. Insights from the results can guide further refinements to the model.
