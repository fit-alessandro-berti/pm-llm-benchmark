Here's a description of the visualization based on the image:

**Type & General Approach:** 
    It looks like a Gantt chart or a timeline visualization with unusual aesthetics. It tracks events across time, represented on the horizontally axis.

**Overall Impression:** The chart has three distinct visual layers.
*   The top layers consist a long vertical bar of grey lines, with each representing a 'Send Fine' event occurring frequently. A very dense visual suggests an extremely high volume of event occurrence.
 
**Details by Layers**

*   **Layer 2 (Grey Lines):** This is represented by thousands grey vertical lines spread over the left third timeframe (i.e. events occurring between 2000 and 2009) , representing activity involving fines, with labels 'Send Fine'.
*   **Bottom Layer (Red Lines):** This shows a series of sloping red lines. The start of the lines clustered from the earlier timestamps, gradually thinning and trending toward 'Send for Credit Collection'. The color scheme emphasizes a change with respect for events, particularly an increased volume of events toward the bottom. 
    

**Timeframe:**  The plot time frames spans from approximately 2000 to 2013. 

**Labels:** Labels denote three possible event states – "Send Fine", 'Introduce Fine Notification, and finally 'Send for Credit Action'.
