 To identify the main differences between these patient pathways, let's break down the processes and note where they diverge. We can categorize the differences based on key steps in a typical healthcare journey: registration, types of examinations, diagnoses, treatments, and discharges. Here are the significant differences:

1. **Registration Point**:
   - Some patients start at "Register at ER" (Emergency Room), while others begin at "Register at FD" (Family Doctor).
   - "I successful" implies that some patients might bypass initial registration and go straight to treatment or discharge.

2. **Types of Examinations**:
   - There are different examination paths:
     - Simple "Examination".
     - "Thorough Examination".
     - "Expert Examination".
   - Some pathways include one type, while others involve multiple types or skip examinations altogether (e.g., "I successful" bypasses all examinations).

3. **Diagnosis and Treatment Success**:
   - Pathways vary significantly based on the success of initial treatment:
     - Some patients have successful treatments right away ("I successful").
     - Others require multiple diagnoses and treatments before being discharged successfully (e.g., "Treatment unsuccessful" leading to another diagnosis and then a subsequent successful treatment).
   - The complexity of the path increases with each additional step, such as repeated diagnoses or treatments.

4. **Number of Steps**:
   - Pathways range from very short ("I successful") to highly complex (with multiple unsuccessful treatments requiring further diagnostics and interventions before discharge).
   - The frequency and performance data indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of these pathways.

5. **Specific Combinations**:
   - Some pathways are unique combinations, such as those that include repeated cycles of diagnoses and treatments. For example:
     - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge
   - Others are shorter but with high frequency, indicating they are common routes (e.g., "I successful").

### Summary of Main Differences:

- **Registration**:
  - ER vs. FD registration.

- **Examination Types**:
  - Simple examination vs. thorough examination vs. expert examination.
  - Pathways may include one, multiple, or no examinations.

- **Diagnosis and Treatment Success**:
  - Directly successful treatments vs. complex pathways with multiple unsuccessful treatments requiring further diagnostics and interventions.
  - Differences in the number of diagnostic cycles and treatment attempts before discharge.

- **Complexity**:
  - High variability in the complexity of patient journeys, ranging from very short and simple to lengthy and complex.

By understanding these differences, healthcare providers can optimize resource allocation, improve patient flow, and enhance overall healthcare efficiency.
