We need to analyze each case. Normative process: sequence must be:


- Always start with Receive order.
- Then Check inventory.
- If inventory sufficient: Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order.
- If insufficient: Cancel order -> Close order.
Also constraints: Authorize payment only after Check inventory and before packaging. Package only after authorization and before shipping. Ship only after packaging and never after cancellation. Close final.

We need to identify violations in cases 1-5.

Case 1: Sequence matches normal flow, no violation.

Case 2: Sequence is Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Violations:


- Package occurs before Authorize payment (should be after).
- Authorize occurs after package (violates ordering).
Thus violation of "Package items should only occur after authorization" and "Authorize payment should be before packaging".
Also shipping occurs after package but that's fine; but the earlier step violates ordering.

Case 3: Sequence is Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. Violations:


- After canceling an order you shouldn't ship; shipping occurs post-cancel which violates "Ship order should not occur after cancellation".
Also maybe cancel should happen immediately after check if insufficient; but here we had authorise then cancel? Actually normative says if insufficient inventory then Cancel directly; but here we authorized payment first then canceled - that might also violate because you shouldn't authorize when insufficient inventory? But the log doesn't indicate whether inventory was sufficient or not; but normative says if insufficient then cancel directly. So having authorise before cancel may violate that rule as well (since you can't authorize when insufficient). But we don't know sufficiency status from log; ambiguous. We can interpret that the presence of Cancel indicates insufficiency; so authorizing before cancel is wrong because you shouldn't authorize when there's not enough stock. So violation of "Authorize payment should only occur when inventory sufficient" or at least "Cancel scenario must follow check directly". So we can mention both.
Case 4: Sequence is Receive, Check, Cancel, Close - correct for insufficient scenario? Yes matches expected sequence for cancellation scenario (Receive->Check->Cancel->Close). No violations.

Case 5: Sequence is Receive->Check->Authorize->Ship->Close missing Package step between Authorization and Shipping => violates rule that package must happen between authorization and shipping. Also missing close? It has close yes at end. Also missing package step so violation of "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping". Also maybe shipping without packaging violates rule about ship requiring packaged items.

Thus violations identified:

Case2 - wrong ordering between package & authorize
Case3 - ship after cancel + possibly unauthorized action
Case5 - missing package

Now produce explanation referencing textual description.

Let's craft answer accordingly with bullet points per case with explanation referencing constraints like "Authorize payment ...", etc., using LaTeX for any math? Not needed likely but could use \text{...}. Use formatting guidelines no special code needed except maybe enumerated list or table summarizing violations.

Let's produce final answer accordingly.

**Summary of deviations**

| Case | Deviations found | Why it breaks the normative model |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **1** | None | Follows *Receive → Check → Authorise → Package → Ship → Close* exactly as described for a “sufficient‑inventory” path |
| **2** | • `Package items` precedes `Authorize payment` <br>• `Authorize payment` follows `Package items` | The text states “*Authorise payment* **must** come *after* *Check inventory* **and** *before* *Package items*.”<br>Placing `Package` first therefore violates both “payment‑after‑check” and “package‑after‑authorisation” constraints.<br>Consequently the whole sequence does not respect the required partial ordering \(C \prec A \prec P \prec S\) where \(C\)=Check inventory,\(A\)=Authorise payment,\(P\)=Package,\(S\)=Ship |
| **3** | • `Ship order` occurs **after** `Cancel order` <br>• An attempt to *Authorise payment* precedes a cancellation (implying an attempt to charge a customer whose stock is unavailable) | The description says “If the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock … proceed directly to *Cancel order*, followed by *Close order*.”<br>Thus once a cancellation has been issued no further fulfillment activities—including shipping—are allowed (“*Ship…should never occur after a cancellation*”).<br>Additionally authorising a charge when the item cannot be supplied contradicts “Authorization must follow a successful inventory check.” |
| **4** | None | Matches the short path *Receive → Check → Cancel → Close*, which is exactly what the text prescribes for an unsatisfied stock situation |
| **5** | • Missing intermediate activity `Package items`; instead goes straight from `Authorize payment` to `Ship order`. <br>• Consequently ships without packaged goods.| The normative flow requires “*Package items* must come **after** authorisation and **before** shipment.” Skipping this step means that shipment happens without prepared goods – violating both “package‑before‑ship” and implicitly “ship requires packaged goods”. |

### Detailed reasoning

1. **Order of activities**

   The process imposes a partial ordering on activities:

   \[
   R \;\prec\; C \;\prec\;
   \begin{cases}
     A \;\prec\; P \;\prec\; S & (\text{inventory sufficient})\\[4pt]
     C_{\text{cancel}} & (\text{inventory insufficient})
   \end{cases}
   \;\prec\;
   X
   \]

   where  
   \(R=\) “Receive”, \(C=\) “Check”, \(A=\) “Authorise”, \(P=\) “Package”,  
   \(S=\) “Ship”, \(C_{\text{cancel}}=\) “Cancel”, \(X=\) “Close”.

2. **Violation in Case 2**

   The observed subsequence  
   \(C\,P\,A\,S\,X\)
   
   does not satisfy either constraint:
   
      – It places \(P\) before its predecessor \(A\).  
      – It places \(A\) outside its required window between \(C\) and \(P,S,X.\)

3. **Violation in Case 3**

    The subsequence  
    \(R\,C\,A\,C_{\text{cancel}}\,S\,X\)

    breaches two rules:

      – After issuing a cancellation (\(C_{\text{cancel}}\)) no further fulfillment actions are allowed (“ship cannot follow cancel”).  
      – Attempting an authorisation (\(A)\)) while an eventual cancellation indicates lack of stock conflicts with “authorisation only follows successful inventory checks.”

4. **Violation in Case 5**

    Here we have  

    \(R\,C\,A\,S\,X.\)

    Because there’s no intermediate ‘\(P)\), this skips the mandatory preparation step required by “…only occur ***after*** authorization ***and*** ***before*** shipment.” Thus shipment proceeds without packaged goods—a direct breach of that constraint.

### Conclusion

Only cases 1 and 4 adhere fully to the normative process description.
Cases 2, 3 and 5 contain one or more activity‐ordering violations as explained above.
