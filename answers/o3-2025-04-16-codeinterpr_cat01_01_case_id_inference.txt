In this short fragment only three distinct “patient profiles” can be seen, and each profile shows a coherent, chronologically-consistent care path.  
Those profiles therefore represent the three hidden cases.

CASE 1 – 45-year-old male, ER visit for a leg fracture  
Events: 1  4  7  12  15  
• #1  Register patient (ER)  
• #4  Initial triage (ER)  
• #7  X-ray imaging (Radiology) – left leg  
• #12 Doctor consultation (ER) – hairline fracture diagnosed  
• #15 Patient discharged (ER) – outpatient follow-up  

CASE 2 – 62-year-old female, ER visit for minor infection  
Events: 2  5  8  10  11  14  17  
• #2  Register patient (ER)  
• #5  Initial triage (ER)  
• #8  Lab test requested (ER)  
• #10 Lab test completed (Laboratory)  
• #11 Doctor consultation (ER) – diagnosis given  
• #14 Prescription created (ER) – antibiotics  
• #17 Patient discharged (ER) – pharmacy pick-up  

CASE 3 – 28-year-old male, scheduled knee surgery  
Events: 3  6  9  13  16  18  
• #3  Register patient (Surgery)  
• #6  Doctor consultation (Surgery) – scheduled procedure confirmed  
• #9  Surgery preparation (Surgery)  
• #13 Surgery performed (Surgery) – arthroscopy  
• #16 Recovery room (Surgery)  
• #18 Patient discharged (Surgery) – physiotherapy follow-up  

Why this grouping is reliable  
1. Unique demographic combination: Each age-gender pair appears only once, so matching on those two fields alone already partitions the events.  
2. Logical clinical sequence: Within each group the activities follow a medically plausible order without overlaps (e.g., triage before imaging, prep before surgery, recovery before discharge).  
3. Temporal consistency: Timestamps inside every group are strictly increasing, while events from the different cases interleave in the global log, which is what one expects in a live hospital setting.

Thus the interleaved 18 events represent three separate cases, grouped as listed above.
