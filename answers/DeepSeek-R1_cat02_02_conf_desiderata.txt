### **1. Normative Rule Violations**

**Case 2**  
- **Violation 1:** *Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check.*  
  - **Explanation:** The normative sequence requires `Credit Check → Risk Assessment`. Case 2 executed `Risk Assessment` at 08:20 before `Credit Check` at 09:00.  
- **Violation 2:** *Finalize Documentation after rejection.*  
  - **Explanation:** After a `Loan Decision (Rejected)`, the case must close without `Finalize Documentation`. Case 2 finalized documentation post-rejection.  
  - **Severity:** Critical (violates strict rules).  

**Case 1 and Case 3**  
- No normative violations. Both follow the required sequence and decision logic (approved cases finalized documentation; Case 3 skipped `Follow-up Call`, but this is a desideratum, not a rule).

### **2. Desiderata Failures**

**Case 3**  
- **Failure 1:** *Credit Check delayed beyond 24 hours.*  
  - **Explanation:** Application received on 2024-01-12 09:00; `Credit Check` occurred on 2024-01-14 10:00 (~49 hours later).  
  - **Note:** Suboptimal but not critical.  
- **Failure 2:** *Applicant informed later than 48 hours after decision.*  
  - **Explanation:** `Loan Decision (Approved)` at 2024-01-14 12:00; `Inform Applicant` at 2024-01-16 15:00 (~51 hours later).  
- **Failure 3:** *No Follow-up Call.*  
  - **Explanation:** Encouraged but not required.  

**Case 1**  
- Met desiderata:  
  - `Credit Check` within 30 minutes of application.  
  - `Inform Applicant` within 2 hours of decision.  
- Missing `Follow-up Call` is technically a desideratum failure but trivial compared to Case 3.  

**Case 2**  
- **No desiderata failures** (irrelevant due to severe normative violations).

### **3. Interpretations/Justifications**

- **Case 3’s Delays:**  
  - The 49-hour gap between `Application Received` and `Credit Check` could stem from a weekend (if 2024-01-13 was a non-working day).  
  - The delay in `Inform Applicant` might reflect external factors (e.g., applicant unavailability).  
- **Case 2’s Ordering Violation:**  
  - The reversed `Risk Assessment` and `Credit Check` could be a human error (e.g., miscommunication between teams).  
- **Case 3’s Missing Follow-up Call:**  
  - Resource constraints or prioritization of other tasks might explain this omission.

### **Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Failures? |  
|------|-----------------------|-----------------------|  
| 1    | None                  | None (Follow-up Call missing, but minor) |  
| 2    | Yes (2 violations)    | No (irrelevant)       |  
| 3    | None                  | Yes (3 failures)      |  

**Key Takeaway:**  
- Case 2 is non-compliant and requires corrective action.  
- Case 3 is compliant but could improve adherence to best practices.
