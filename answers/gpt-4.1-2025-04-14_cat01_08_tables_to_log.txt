Below is a **comprehensive event log** integrating all key process events for each `order_id`. Each row is an event, sequenced by timestamp per case.  
Columns include:  
- **Case ID** (`order_id`)
- **Activity Name**
- **Timestamp**
- **Resource/Actor** (resolved if available, else left as ID)
- **Additional Attributes** (relevant attributes: item_id, quantities, delivery/invoice/payment IDs, etc.)

#### **Assumptions / Notes**:
1. For order creation, salesperson is the resource.
2. For item picking, generate an event per line; show picker and item as resource/attribute.
3. For delivery, dispatch and arrival are two events per delivery; carrier as resource.
4. For invoice, one event per invoice issued; billing clerk as resource.
5. For payment, one event per payment; payment method and reference as attributes.
6. All attribute IDs resolved via Resources/Products tables if possible.
7. Orders (1004) with no downstream events (e.g., no delivery, invoice, payment) have only creation and picking events.
