In practice-mining jargon, each “case” is the complete, chronologically ordered trail of events that belong to one and the same patient visit.  
Although the log shown here has no explicit case identifier, three very stable clues let us reconstruct the hidden groupings:

1. Static patient attributes that do not change during a visit (patient_age + patient_gender).  
2. Typical activity orderings for an ER visit versus a scheduled surgery.  
3. Temporal continuity (events for one patient are never more than a few minutes apart).

By cross-checking these clues, the 18 events split cleanly into three patient journeys.

 Case reconstruction 

CASE 01 – “45-year-old male, ER, hairline-fracture pathway”

Event#1  08:05  Register patient (ER) – 45 M  
Event#4  08:10  Initial triage – 45 M  
Event#7  08:15  X-ray imaging – 45 M  
Event#12 08:23  Doctor consultation – 45 M (diagnosis = hairline fracture)  
Event#15 08:30  Patient discharged – 45 M (follow-up outpatient clinic)

CASE 02 – “62-year-old female, ER, minor-infection pathway”

Event#2  08:07  Register patient (ER) – 62 F  
Event#5  08:12  Initial triage – 62 F  
Event#8  08:16  Lab test requested – 62 F  
Event#10 08:20  Lab test completed – 62 F  
Event#11 08:22  Doctor consultation – 62 F (diagnosis = minor infection)  
Event#14 08:27  Prescription created – 62 F  
Event#17 08:35  Patient discharged – 62 F (follow-up pharmacy pickup)

CASE 03 – “28-year-old male, scheduled knee surgery”

Event#3  08:07  Register patient (Surgery) – 28 M  
Event#6  08:13  Doctor consultation – 28 M (scheduled knee surgery)  
Event#9  08:16  Surgery preparation – 28 M  
Event#13 08:25  Surgery performed – 28 M  
Event#16 08:31  Recovery room – 28 M  
Event#18 08:40  Patient discharged – 28 M (follow-up physiotherapy)

 How the grouping was derived 

• The age+gender pair (45 M, 62 F, 28 M) is unique across the log, letting us cluster events unambiguously.  
• Within each cluster the activities follow a medically plausible order (registration  triage/labs/consults  discharge in ER; registration  pre-op  surgery  recovery  discharge in the OR pathway).  
• Time stamps show no overlaps that would contradict the grouping (for example, the 62-year-old female never appears in Radiology or Surgery).

Event  Case  
1  01  
2  02  
3  03  
4  01  
5  02  
6  03  
7  01  
8  02  
9  03  
10  02  
11  02

13  03  
14  02  
15  01  
16  03  
17  02  
18  03

Thus, the interleaved log actually contains three distinct cases.
