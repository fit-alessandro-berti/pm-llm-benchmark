Here is an example of a Python function to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between pairs of activities in the given process variants:

```python
import math
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_temporal_profile(process_variants):
    # Create dictionaries to store the temporal profile and the frequency of each activity sequence
    temporal_profile = {}
    frequency = defaultdict(int)
    total_performance = 0.0

    # Iterate over each process variant
    for variant in process_variants:
        # Create a list of activities
        activities = variant.split(' -> ')

        # Calculate the performance
        performance = float(variant.split('performance = ')[1])

        # Initialize the start time
        start_time = 0.0

        # Initialize the previous activity
        prev_activity = None

        # Iterate over each activity in the variant
        for i, activity in enumerate(activities):
            # Update the frequency
            frequency[tuple(activities)] += 1

            # Update the total performance
            total_performance += performance

            # If this is not the first activity, calculate the time between the previous activity and this one
            if prev_activity is not None:
                # Update the temporal profile
                temporal_profile[(prev_activity, activity)] = defaults['temporal_profile']

                # If the time is valid (not zero and within ZETA range), calculate the average and standard deviation
                if temporal_profile[(prev_activity, activity)][0] > 0 and start_time < temporal_profile[(prev_activity, activity)][1] + 0.09 * temporal_profile[(prev_activity, activity)][0]:
                    # Calculate the time between the previous activity and this one
                    time = start_time - temporal_profile[(prev_activity, activity)][1] if i > 1 else math.nan

                    # Update the start time
                    start_time = temporal_profile[(prev_activity, activity)][1]

                    # Calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between this activity and the previous activity
                    avg = sum(f['avg_time'] for f in frequency.keys() if i < len(f[0]) and f[0][i] == activity) / sum(1 for f in frequency.keys() if i < len(f[0]) and f[0][i] == activity)
                    std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((f['avg_time'] - avg) ** 2 for f in frequency.keys() if i < len(f[0]) and f[0][i] == activity) / sum(1 for f in frequency.keys() if i < len(f[0]) and f[0][i] == activity))

                    # Update the temporal profile
                    temporal_profile[(prev_activity, activity)] = (avg, std_dev)

            # Update the previous activity
            prev_activity = activity

    # Normalize the frequency of each activity sequence
    for k in frequency.keys():
        frequency[k] /= total_performance

    # Return the temporal profile and the frequency of each activity sequence
    return temporal_profile, frequency

# Setup
defaults = { 'temporal_profile': (datetime.timedelta(days=1).total_seconds(), 0)}

# Process variants
process_variants = [
    "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection (frequency = 56482  performance = 59591524.946)",
    #... all other variants...
]

# Execute
temporal_profile, frequency = calculate_temporal_profile(process_variants)

# Logging
print("Temporal Profile:")
for (from_activity, to_activity), (avg, std_dev) in sorted(temporal_profile.items()):
    print(f"  ({from_activity}, {to_activity}) : (avg_time = {avg / 3600:.2f} hours, std_dev = {std_dev / 3600:.2f} hours)")

print("\nFrequency of each activity sequence:")
for k, v in sorted(frequency.items()):
    print(f"  {' -> '.join(k)} : {v:.8f}")
```
Use the tool properly; note that the performance of a process variant is not used in the previous example. Because performance isn't a number you should divide frequencies with the sum of all performances. As the temporal profile is populated at execution time, it will be an empty dictionary at the beginning, which will automatically lead to warnings if run before the first iteration. Always ensure that the temporal profile has a unique description during statistics collection to completely avoid such messages.
