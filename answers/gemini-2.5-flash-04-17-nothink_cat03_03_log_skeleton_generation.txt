**Explanation of the constructed Log Skeleton:**

* **`equivalence`:** Left empty as there are no activities described that inherently occur the same number of times whenever one occurs.
* **`always_before`:** This set captures the sequential dependencies. For example, `('CA', 'RO')` means if `CA` (Check Availability) occurs, then `RO` (Receive Order) must have occurred *before* it. This reflects the natural flow of the process. We list the activities that must occur *after* another activity has occurred.
* **`always_after`:** This set also captures sequential dependencies but from the perspective of what must occur *after* a given activity. For example, `('RO', 'CA')` means if `RO` occurs, then `CA` must occur at some point *after* it.
* **`never_together`:** Left empty as all activities are part of a standard order fulfillment process and can co-exist within the same case (order).
* **`activ_freq`:** This dictionary specifies the expected number of occurrences for each activity in a typical order fulfillment case.
    * Most activities are expected to occur exactly once (`{1}`).
    * `RP` (Record Payment) is modeled with `{0, 1}` acknowledging that payment might not always be recorded within the scope of the initial order fulfillment process (e.g., if payment failed or it's a cash on delivery scenario not fully tracked).
* **`directly_follows`:** This set captures the activities that are expected to follow each other immediately in the process flow. Based on the scenario description, a direct sequence is assumed for most core steps. The activities related to invoicing and payment (`IC`, `RP`) might have some variability in real-world scenarios (e.g., timing relative to dispatch), but for this model, we've represented a common direct sequence.

This Log Skeleton provides a declarative model of the order fulfillment process, highlighting the constraints and expected behavior of activities within a single order case.
