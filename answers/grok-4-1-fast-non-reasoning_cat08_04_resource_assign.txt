# Process Improvement Plan for TechSolve Solutions' IT Service Desk

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To analyze resource behavior and assignment patterns, I would extract and visualize key metrics from the event log using process mining tools (e.g., Celonis, Disco, ProM, or PM4Py).

### Key Metrics to Focus On:
- **Workload Distribution**: Cases handled per agent/tier (throughput), active cases simultaneously (multitasking index), and total working time per agent.
- **Processing Times**: Average/median cycle time per activity per agent/tier (e.g., Work L1 Start to End), idle time before assignment.
- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate**: Percentage of L1 assignments without escalation/reassignment (filter cases where "Escalate L2" or "Reassign" follows L1 work).
- **Skill-Specific Performance**: Tickets resolved per required skill per agent, resolution time for matched vs. mismatched skills.
- **Tier Utilization**: Percentage of tickets escalated from L1 to L2/L3, L2/L3 tickets handled by L1-capable agents.

### Process Mining Techniques:
- **Resource Interaction Analysis**: 
  - **Handover Networks**: Visualize ticket handovers (e.g., A05  Dispatcher  B12  B15 for INC-1001). High handover density indicates reassignment issues.
  - **Resource Profiles**: Per-agent views showing activity frequency, case duration, and collaboration patterns.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Nodes as agents/tiers, edges weighted by handover frequency. Identifies "broker" agents overloaded with escalations and isolated underutilized agents.
- **Role Discovery**: Algorithmically cluster agents by activity patterns (e.g., "CRM Specialists" handling App-CRM tickets) vs. documented tiers/skills.
- **Comparison to Intended Logic**: Overlay discovered process models (actual paths) against normative models (round-robin L1  skill-escalation L2/L3). Highlight deviations like L2 agents doing L1 work.

### Skill Utilization Analysis:
- **Skill Coverage Maps**: Matrix of agent skills vs. ticket required skills. Calculate:
  - Coverage ratio: % tickets with required skill available in assigned tier.
  - Underutilization: % time specialists spend on "Basic-Troubleshoot" tickets.
- **Skill Bottleneck Detection**: Tickets waiting longest per required skill (e.g., Networking-Firewall delays due to few B08-like agents).

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Using the above analysis, pinpoint issues through targeted filters and conformance checking:

### Specific Problems and Quantification:
- **Skill Availability Bottlenecks**: Filter by "Required Skill" and measure average time-to-assignment post-escalation. E.g., if Networking-Firewall tickets wait >30min while App-CRM <10min, flag shortage of firewall specialists.
- **Reassignment/Escalation Delays**: Calculate delay per event:
  - Avg. delay per reassignment: Timestamp diff between "Work L2 End"  "Reassign"  next "Work Start" (e.g., INC-1001: ~50min from B12 to B15).
  - Escalation overhead: % tickets with 2 escalations/reassignments (target <10%); total delay contribution (e.g., 20% of P2 SLA breaches from reassignments).
- **Incorrect Initial Assignments**: % L1 assignments where agent skills mismatch "Required Skill" (e.g., A02 lacks Networking-Firewall). Correlate with escalation rate.
- **Overloaded/Underperforming Agents**: Pareto analysis of top 20% agents handling 80% workload; compare their cycle times vs. peers.
- **SLA Breach Correlation**: Decision tree on breached tickets: Filter P2/P3 breaches, drill into root activities (e.g., 40% linked to L2 assignment delays >2hrs).

**Quantified Impact Example** (hypothetical from log):
| Issue                  | Frequency (% tickets) | Avg. Delay Added | SLA Breach Contribution |
|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Skill Mismatch Reassign| 15%                  | 45 min          | 25% of P2 breaches    |
| L2 Queue Delays       | 22%                  | 1.2 hrs         | 35% of P3 breaches    |
| L1 Over-Escalation    | 60% (of L1 tickets)  | 30 min          | 15%                   |

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### Potential Root Causes:
- **Assignment Rules Deficiency**: Round-robin ignores skills/workload, leading to mismatches (e.g., A05 assigned App-CRM without skill).
- **Incomplete Skill Profiles**: Documented skills outdated; actual skills discovered via mining differ (e.g., B12 has DB-SQL but reassigned).
- **Poor Ticket Triage**: Inaccurate "Required Skill" at creation (e.g., initial App-CRM later needs Database-SQL).
- **No Real-Time Visibility**: Dispatcher lacks workload views, causing uneven distribution.
- **L1 Limitations**: High escalation rate due to insufficient training (e.g., 60% FCR target unmet).

### Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause:
- **Variant Analysis**:
  - **Happy Path Variants**: Cases with 1 assignment, no escalation (e.g., direct L2 resolve). Compare attributes (priority, category, initial skill match) vs. deviant variants.
  - **DevPath Variants**: Cases with 2 reassignments. Decision mining on branch points (e.g., "Escalate L2" decision rules).
- **Decision Mining**: Extract rules from log (e.g., "IF Required Skill = Networking-Firewall THEN 80% chance of L1 escalation"). Identify poor predictors like category alone.
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Correlate external attributes (e.g., ticket volume peaks causing overload) with bottlenecks using performance spectra.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Skill-Matched Initial Routing with Proficiency Scoring
- **Addresses**: Skill mismatches and unnecessary L1 escalations (60% rate).
- **Leverages Mining**: Skill coverage maps and historical resolution success rates per agent-skill pair.
- **Data Required**: Agent skills (from profiles + discovered), ticket required skill, past resolution times/success per skill.
- **Implementation**: Score agents by proficiency (e.g., resolution time percentile + FCR). Route new tickets to top-3 available matches across tiers (bypass L1 if P2+ and L1 coverage <50%).
- **Expected Benefits**: Reduce escalations 40%, cut reassignment delay 45min/ticket, lift FCR to 75%.

### Strategy 2: Workload-Balanced Dynamic Assignment
- **Addresses**: Uneven workload (Pareto overload) and dispatcher delays.
- **Leverages Mining**: Real-time resource profiles (queue length, active cases, predicted completion from historical cycle times).
- **Data Required**: Current agent workload (active cases), estimated service time (mined per agent-activity), availability status.
- **Implementation**: Assignment algorithm: Score = Skill Match (50%) + Inverse Workload (30%) + Proximity (tier match, 20%). Use real-time dashboard for auto-dispatch.
- **Expected Benefits**: Balance workload (top 20% agents drop from 80% to 50% share), reduce L2 start delays 50%, improve SLA by 25%.

### Strategy 3: Predictive Skill and Complexity Routing
- **Addresses**: Poor initial categorization and over-reliance on manual triage.
- **Leverages Mining**: Classification models trained on historical tickets (features: description keywords, category, priority  required skill, tier needed, resolution time).
- **Data Required**: Ticket text (keywords via NLP), historical mappings (e.g., 70% Software-App need App-CRM), variant outcomes.
- **Implementation**: ML model predicts "Required Skill" and "Complexity Tier" at creation. Route directly (e.g., P2 Network  L2 firewall specialist).
- **Expected Benefits**: 30% fewer reassignments, 20% faster initial assignment, SLA improvement via proactive specialist allocation.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### Business Process Simulation for Evaluation:
- **Approach**: Use mined process models (discovered Petri nets/BPMN) and resource calendars (from log: avg. working hours, skill availability). Simulate strategies in tools like ProSim or Celonis Simulate.
  - **Scenarios**: Replay 10k historical cases under new rules; inject stochastic elements (arrival rates, service times).
  - **KPIs Tested**: Throughput time, SLA compliance, resource utilization (target 75-85%), reassignment rate.
- **Validation**: Compare simulated vs. actual outcomes; A/B test on subset of live tickets.

### Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan:
- **Dashboards** (e.g., Celonis Process Intelligence):
  | KPI/View                  | Target          | Update Frequency |
  |---------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
  | Avg. Reassignments/Ticket | <0.2            | Real-time       |
  | Tier Escalation Rate      | L1L2 <30%      | Daily           |
  | Skill Match %             | >85%            | Daily           |
  | Agent Utilization         | 75-85%          | Hourly          |
  | SLA Compliance by Priority| P2>95%, P3>90% | Daily           |
  | Handover Network          | Density <5 edges/agent | Weekly       |
- **Continuous Mining**: Automated conformance checks vs. target model; anomaly detection for SLA-risk tickets; monthly variant analysis for drifts.
- **Feedback Loop**: Quarterly re-mining to refine ML models and rules based on new data.

This data-driven approach, rooted in process mining, will transform TechSolve's assignment from reactive round-robin to predictive, skill-optimized routing, targeting 30-50% efficiency gains.
