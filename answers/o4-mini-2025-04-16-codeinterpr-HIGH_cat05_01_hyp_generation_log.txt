Below is a structured example of how you might approach this in three steps:  

1.   Detect and describe the main anomalies in your sample log  
2.   Hypothesize possible root-causes  
3.   Give a suite of SQL queries you can run against `order_event_log` (and, where indicated, `orders` and `resources`) to drill into each hypothesis.

1. ANOMALIES / UNDESIRABLE BEHAVIORS  
———————————————————  
Case 1002  
  • “Confirm Shipment” (08:25) and “Ship Goods” (08:40) happen before the credit check (09:10) and even before stock validation (09:15).  
  • Missing the normal “Validate Stock” step prior to shipping.  

Case 1003  
  • “Ship Goods” (09:10) occurs before “Confirm Shipment” (09:45).  
  • Entirely missing the “Validate Stock” step.  

Case 1004  
  • “Receive Payment” (09:05) comes before “Issue Invoice” (09:20).  
  • “Confirm Shipment” flagged `shipment_scheduled=N` yet goods are still shipped (09:50).  

—  
2. POSSIBLE ROOT-CAUSE HYPOTHESES  
———————————————————  
• Policy / system exception for priority orders (auto-ship, skip credit check/stock)  
• Resource training gaps or manual overrides (Warehouse or Logistics skipping steps)  
• Misconfigured automation rules (e.g. “if order_value > X  auto-ship”)  
• Timestamp recording errors (clocks out of sync)  
• Dataentry mistakes (wrong activity code, wrong flag)  

—  
3. INVESTIGATIVE SQL QUERIES  
———————————————————  
Below are template queries. You can parameterize activity names or thresholds as needed.  

A) Find cases missing a given activity  
-----------------------------------------------------  
-- cases with NO credit check  
SELECT o.case_id  
FROM orders o  
LEFT JOIN (  
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id  
    FROM order_event_log  
    WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'  
) cc ON o.case_id = cc.case_id  
WHERE cc.case_id IS NULL;  

-- likewise: replace 'Perform Credit Check' with 'Validate Stock' or 'Confirm Shipment'  

B) Find out-of-order pairs via window functions  
-----------------------------------------------------  
WITH seq AS (  
    SELECT  
      case_id,  
      activity,  
      timestamp,  
      LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_act  
    FROM order_event_log  
)  
SELECT DISTINCT case_id  
FROM seq  
WHERE  
    (activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND prev_act IN ('Confirm Shipment','Ship Goods'))  
    OR (activity = 'Ship Goods' AND prev_act = 'Perform Credit Check' /* example if CC must precede ship */)  
;  

C) Find “Ship Goods” BEFORE “Confirm Shipment”  
-----------------------------------------------------  
WITH times AS (  
    SELECT  
      case_id,  
      MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Ship Goods')   AS ship_time,  
      MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Confirm Shipment') AS conf_time  
    FROM order_event_log  
    GROUP BY case_id  
)  
SELECT case_id, ship_time, conf_time  
FROM times  
WHERE ship_time < conf_time;  

D) Find “Receive Payment” BEFORE “Issue Invoice”  
-----------------------------------------------------  
WITH t AS (  
    SELECT  
      case_id,  
      MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Receive Payment') AS pay_time,  
      MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Issue Invoice')    AS inv_time  
    FROM order_event_log  
    GROUP BY case_id  
)  
SELECT case_id, pay_time, inv_time  
FROM t  
WHERE pay_time < inv_time;  

E) Aggregate anomalies by order_type (are they mostly “priority” orders?)  
-----------------------------------------------------  
WITH anomaly_cases AS (  
    -- reuse C) or D) or your own anomaly definition  
    SELECT case_id FROM times WHERE ship_time < conf_time  
)  
SELECT o.order_type, COUNT(*) AS anomaly_cnt,  
    COUNT(*)::decimal / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders) AS pct_of_all_cases  
FROM orders o  
JOIN anomaly_cases a ON o.case_id = a.case_id  
GROUP BY o.order_type;  

F) Which resources are most involved in anomalies?  
-----------------------------------------------------  
WITH bad_ship AS (  
    SELECT case_id FROM times WHERE ship_time < conf_time  
), shipments AS (  
    SELECT case_id, resource  
    FROM order_event_log  
    WHERE activity='Ship Goods'  
)  
SELECT r.resource_id, res.role, res.department, COUNT(*) AS num_bad_ships  
FROM bad_ship b  
JOIN shipments s ON b.case_id = s.case_id  
JOIN resources res ON s.resource = res.resource_id  
GROUP BY r.resource_id, res.role, res.department  
ORDER BY num_bad_ships DESC;  

G) Correlation of anomalies with order_value (are highvalue orders more prone?)  
-----------------------------------------------------  
WITH anomaly_list AS (  
    -- pick any anomaly filter, e.g. missing credit check  
    SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log  
    WHERE activity='Ship Goods'  
    EXCEPT  
    SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity='Perform Credit Check'  
)  
SELECT  
    AVG(o.order_value) AS avg_value_all,  
    AVG(o2.order_value) AS avg_value_anomaly  
FROM orders o  
LEFT JOIN anomaly_list a ON o.case_id = a.case_id  
LEFT JOIN orders o2 ON a.case_id = o2.case_id;  

H) Timelag analysis: how long between “Perform Credit Check”  “Ship Goods”?  
-----------------------------------------------------  
SELECT  
    case_id,  
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Ship Goods')  
      - MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Perform Credit Check'))/3600  
      AS hours_cc_to_ship  
FROM order_event_log  
GROUP BY case_id  
ORDER BY hours_cc_to_ship DESC  
LIMIT 20;  

—  
With these building-blocks you can:  
• Quantify how many and which cases deviate,  
• See if anomalies cluster by order_type, order_value or by resource/department,  
• Measure timedelays,  
• And test whether “priority” orders or “high-value” ones are systematically being fast-tracked (and skipping controls) or whether this is random data entry/system noise.  

From there you can drill into:  
– System logs around exception rules  
– Training/SLAs for specific roles  
– Clocksync and timestamprecording processes.
