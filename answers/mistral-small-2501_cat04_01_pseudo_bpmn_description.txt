The provided pseudo-BPMN representation describes a business process for handling customer requests, specifically differentiating between standard and custom requests. Below is a detailed explanation of the process, including the purpose of each step, the meaning of the gateways, and how the different paths converge or loop back.

### Process Overview

1. **Start Event**
   - The process begins when a customer request is received.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
   - The process involves receiving a customer request, which initiates the workflow.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
   - This gateway directs the flow based on the type of the customer request (Standard or Custom).

### Standard Request Path

4. **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
   - For standard requests, this task involves performing typical validation checks to ensure the request meets predefined criteria.

5. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
   - This gateway initiates two parallel tasks that need to be completed simultaneously.

6. **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
   - This task involves checking the customer's credit status.

7. **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
   - This task involves checking the availability of inventory.

8. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
   - This join ensures that both the credit check and inventory check are completed before proceeding.

9. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
   - Based on the results of the parallel checks, this task calculates the delivery date.

### Custom Request Path

4. **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
   - For custom requests, this task involves performing a feasibility analysis to determine if the customization is possible.

5. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
   - This gateway directs the flow based on the feasibility of the customization.

6. **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
   - If the customization is feasible, this task prepares a custom quotation for the customer.

7. **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
   - If the customization is not feasible, this task sends a rejection notice to the customer and the process ends.

### Post-Validation/Analysis Tasks

8. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
   - This gateway determines if the completed tasks require manager approval.

9. **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
   - If approval is needed, this task involves obtaining approval from a manager.

10. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
    - This gateway directs the flow based on whether the approval is granted or not.

11. **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
    - If approval is granted or if approval is not needed, this task generates the final invoice.

12. **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
    - If approval is not granted, this task involves re-evaluating the conditions.

13. **Loop back to Task E1 (for Custom Path) or Task D (for Standard Path)**
    - Depending on the path, the process loops back to either Task E1 for custom requests or Task D for standard requests to rework the conditions.

### Final Steps

14. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
    - This task sends a confirmation to the customer, indicating that the process has been completed successfully.

15. **End Event**
    - The process ends after the confirmation is sent to the customer.

### Summary of Differences and Looping Conditions

- **Standard vs. Custom Paths:**
  - Standard requests involve validation and parallel checks (credit and inventory), followed by delivery date calculation.
  - Custom requests involve feasibility analysis and, if feasible, custom quotation preparation.

- **Approval and Rework Conditions:**
  - If approval is needed and not granted, the process loops back for re-evaluation and rework.
  - Approval conditions are checked after the initial validation/analysis steps.

This detailed process ensures that both standard and custom requests are handled efficiently, with appropriate checks and approvals to maintain the quality and feasibility of the customer's request.
