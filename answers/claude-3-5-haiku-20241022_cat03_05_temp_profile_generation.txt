Here's a comprehensive temporal profile for the global supply chain process, capturing the nuanced time relationships between activities:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Close proximity/sequential activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (3600, 1800),     # Supplier selection to order placement (1 hour ± 30 min)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 86400),  # Order placement to component receipt (2 days ± 1 day)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 3600),     # Component receipt to quality inspection (2 hours ± 1 hour)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (3600, 1800),     # Quality inspection to component assembly (1 hour ± 30 min)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (7200, 3600),     # Component assembly to product testing (2 hours ± 1 hour)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 1800),     # Product testing to packaging (1 hour ± 30 min)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1800, 900),      # Packaging to warehouse storage (30 min ± 15 min)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),   # Warehouse storage to distribution (1 day ± 12 hours)

    # Non-sequential, but potential process connections
    ('SS', 'RC'): (259200, 129600), # Supplier selection to component receipt (3 days ± 1.5 days)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (345600, 172800), # Order placement to component assembly (4 days ± 2 days)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (604800, 302400), # Quality inspection to distribution (7 days ± 3.5 days)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (432000, 216000), # Supplier selection to product testing (5 days ± 2.5 days)
    
    # Long-range process connections
    ('SS', 'AS'): (2592000, 1296000), # Supplier selection to after-sales support (30 days ± 15 days)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000),  # Distribution to after-sales support (30 days ± 10 days)
}
```

The temporal profile captures several key aspects of the supply chain process:

1. **Short-range Temporal Relationships**: 
   - Immediate sequential activities have tighter standard deviations
   - Examples: order placement to receipt, assembly to testing

2. **Medium-range Temporal Connections**:
   - Non-sequential but related activities
   - Larger time ranges and standard deviations
   - Examples: supplier selection to component assembly, quality inspection to distribution

3. **Long-range Process Connections**:
   - Broad temporal relationships spanning entire process lifecycle
   - Significant variability in timing
   - Examples: supplier selection to after-sales support

The time units are in seconds, representing a realistic modeling of process variability:
- Short activities: hours (3600 seconds)
- Medium activities: days (86400 seconds)
- Long-range processes: weeks to months

The standard deviations reflect the inherent uncertainty in complex manufacturing and supply chain processes, capturing potential delays, efficiencies, and variabilities.
