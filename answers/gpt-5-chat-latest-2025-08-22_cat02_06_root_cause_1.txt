Great — let’s analyze this systematically.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total resolution time for each case**
We’ll measure from **Receive Ticket  Close Ticket**.

- **Case 101**:  
  2024-03-01 08:00  2024-03-01 10:15 = **2h 15m**  

- **Case 102**:  
  2024-03-01 08:05  2024-03-02 09:15 = **about 25h 10m**  

- **Case 103**:  
  2024-03-01 08:10  2024-03-01 09:30 = **1h 20m**  

- **Case 104**:  
  2024-03-01 08:20  2024-03-02 08:30 = **about 24h 10m**  

- **Case 105**:  
  2024-03-01 08:25  2024-03-03 09:30 = **about 49h 5m ( 2 days)**  

 **Significantly delayed cases:** **102, 104, 105**.  
Normal baseline resolution times (cases without problems: 101 & 103) are **1–2 hours**.

---

### **Step 2: Identify causes of delays**
Let’s inspect those long cases more closely.

#### **Case 102 (25h 10m)**  
- Escalation triggered at **11:30**.  
- **Gap** between escalation (2024-03-01 11:30) and next investigation (2024-03-01 14:00)  **2.5 hours**.  
- Major delay: issue not resolved until **next morning** (2024-03-02 09:00), indicating overnight waiting.  
- **Cause:** Escalation introduces significant overnight delay before resolution.

#### **Case 104 (24h 10m)**  
- Large gap: **Assign to L1 at 09:30**  **Investigate Issue only at 13:00** (3.5h delay before work even starts).  
- Then another big delay: investigation ends at 13:00 but resolution only happens **next morning (8:00)**  ~19h gap.  
- **Cause:** Slow start of investigation plus overnight wait before resolution.

#### **Case 105 (49h 5m)**  
- Escalation occurred **2024-03-01 10:00**.  
- Investigation at L2 team does not begin until **2024-03-02 14:00**  **28 hours delay**.  
- Then resolution only happens the **next morning after that (2024-03-03 09:00)**.  
- **Cause:** Escalation led to *extremely long waiting times* between handoff and investigation by Level 2.

---

### **Step 3: General root causes**
From the above, main bottlenecks are:

1. **Escalations to Level-2 cause severe waiting times**
   - Case 102: overnight delay.  
   - Case 105: more than a full day before investigation resumed.  

2. **Long idle times before investigation starts**
   - Case 104: >3h delay just to begin investigating.  
   - Suggests workload balancing or prioritization issue.

3. **Overnight or next-day waiting for resolution**
   - Several cases (102, 104, 105) show tickets sitting idle until the following day even after investigation, likely due to shifting work across support shifts or backlog.

---

### **Step 4: Recommendations / Insights**
- **Improve escalation handling:**  
  Escalated tickets cause *major delays*. Introduce SLA targets for L2 teams (e.g., maximum handoff-to-investigation time of 2–4 hours).

- **Reduce idle times before investigation:**  
  Many tickets wait hours before the first “Investigate Issue” step. Root cause may be poor triage prioritization or overloading of L1 agents.

- **Address overnight work gaps:**  
  Tickets should not remain idle until the next day after being investigated. Options: extend L2/L1 operational coverage (e.g., staggered shifts) or implement “follow-the-sun” support to speed global coverage.

- **Early escalation policy:**  
  If certain ticket types are *likely* to require L2, escalate them promptly instead of assigning them to L1 first — reducing wasted hours.

- **Monitoring & reporting:**  
  Track key performance metrics:  
  - *Time from assign  investigation started*.  
  - *Time from escalation  L2 investigation started*.  
  - *Investigation  resolution delay*.  
  Identify outliers earlier and intervene.

---

 **Summary of Findings:**  
- Normal tickets close in **~1–2 hours**.  
- Delayed cases (102, 104, 105) take **1–2 days** due to **escalation delays, idle time before investigation, and overnight waiting for resolution**.  
- **Primary bottleneck:** escalation handling at Level-2 combined with scheduling/coverage gaps.  
- **Recommendation:** enforce tighter SLAs for escalations, improve staffing/coverage, reduce idle pre-investigation wait, and introduce earlier escalation when applicable.

Would you like me to also **visualize this as a process timeline (per case with waiting times highlighted)** to make the bottlenecks even clearer?
