### 1) Cases with significantly longer total resolution (Receive  Close)

| Case | Start (Receive) | End (Close) | Total cycle time | Notes vs others |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| 103 | 2024-03-01 08:10 | 2024-03-01 09:30 | **1h 20m** | Fast |
| 101 | 2024-03-01 08:00 | 2024-03-01 10:15 | **2h 15m** | Fast |
| 104 | 2024-03-01 08:20 | 2024-03-02 08:30 | **24h 10m** | **Very long** |
| 102 | 2024-03-01 08:05 | 2024-03-02 09:15 | **25h 10m** | **Very long** (escalation) |
| 105 | 2024-03-01 08:25 | 2024-03-03 09:30 | **49h 05m** | **Longest** (escalation + long queues) |

“Significantly longer” here are **102, 104, 105**, with **105** as the main outlier.

### 2) Likely root causes (patterns/factors driving delay)

#### A. Escalation introduces major queue/hand-off time (102, 105)
- **Case 102**
  - Assign L1  Escalate L2: **2h 30m**
  - L2 Escalate  Investigate: **2h 30m**
  - Investigate  Resolve: **~19h** (overnight wait)
- **Case 105**
  - Escalate to L2 (10:00 Mar-01)  L2 Investigate (14:00 Mar-02): **~28h**
  - Then Investigate  Resolve: **~19h** (another overnight wait)

**Pattern:** Once a ticket hits Level-2, it appears to sit in a backlog/queue for a long time.

#### B. Large “idle gaps” between key activities (especially investigation and resolution)
Even without escalation, **Case 104** is very slow due to waiting:
- Assign L1 (09:30)  Investigate (13:00): **3h 30m**
- Investigate (13:00)  Resolve (next day 08:00): **~19h**

**Pattern:** Work starts late and then rolls over to the next day, suggesting capacity constraints, batching, or end-of-day cutoffs.

#### C. Overnight delays dominate the longest cases
The repeated **~19h gaps** (e.g., 14:00  next day 09:00, 13:00  next day 08:00) strongly suggest:
- resolution steps not performed after business hours, and/or
- tickets are not progressed continuously (handoffs/queues), and/or
- “Resolve Ticket” is done in a scheduled/batched manner (e.g., morning processing).

### 3) How these factors increase cycle time + recommendations

#### How they drive longer cycle times
- **Escalations = extra handoffs + separate queues.** Each handoff adds waiting time (L2 backlog is the clearest bottleneck in this data).
- **Long waits before/after investigation = low flow efficiency.** The ticket spends most of its life waiting rather than being worked on (especially in 104/105).
- **End-of-day rollover effect.** Starting investigation midday but not resolving until next morning produces a predictable ~19–20 hour delay.

#### Recommendations to address bottlenecks
1. **Reduce time-to-start for Level-2 work**
   - Set/monitor an SLA like “L2 acknowledge/investigate within X hours”.
   - Add L2 capacity or implement WIP limits and priority rules for aged tickets.
   - Improve L1 triage quality so escalations are more complete (better info reduces L2 rework/queue cycling).

2. **Improve handoff/assignment speed**
   - Automate routing/assignment (skills-based routing) to cut “Assign  Escalate/Investigate” delays.
   - Standardize escalation packets (required fields, logs, reproduction steps) to avoid ping-pong.

3. **Address overnight rollover**
   - If after-hours work is not possible, introduce a **“same-day resolution cutoff”** policy: tickets investigated after a certain time get prioritized to be resolved before close of business.
   - Alternatively, add staggered coverage/on-call for high-priority tickets to prevent the consistent overnight gap.

4. **Operational monitoring**
   - Track per-step waiting times (queue time) separately from working time.
   - Create alerts for tickets sitting >N hours in statuses like “Assigned”, “Escalated”, or “Investigating”.

If you want, I can compute “flow efficiency” per case (active work vs waiting) from this log and highlight the single biggest delay segment across all cases (it’s likely the L2 queue in case 105).
