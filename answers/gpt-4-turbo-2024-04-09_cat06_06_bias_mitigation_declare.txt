After analyzing the loan application process and considering the requirement to mitigate potential bias against sensitive attributes, I have introduced specific constraints that enhance fairness and consistency across decision-making activities. Below is the updated version of the `declare_model` dictionary:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensuring Manual Review is considered
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
        # Ensuring that any decision involving a sensitive variable requires a Manual Review
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
        # BiasMitigationCheck must follow any check of sensitive attributes.
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
        # Ensuring FinalDecision only occurs after BiasMitigationChecks for fairness.
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
        # Preventing immediate rejection based on an assessment of a sensitive attribute.
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Explanation of Added Constraints to Reduce Bias in the Loan Application Process:**

1. **Coexistence Constraint for Manual Reviews**: When decisions like `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority` are made, the `ManualReview` must always coexist in the trace. This ensures thorough scrutiny and prevents unfair decisions based solely on sensitive attributes.

2. **Response Constraint for Bias Mitigation Checks**: Following a check of sensitive attributes such as `ApplicantRace` or `ApplicantGender`, a `BiasMitigationCheck` is mandated before proceeding with the process. This step is designed to analyze and potentially rectify any biased impressions or datasets influencing the next steps of the application.

3. **Succession Constraint Guaranteeing Fair Decision Sequencing**: The `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede a `FinalDecision` to ensure that decisions are made post examination of any bias that might have affected the application.

4. **Non-Succession Constraint to Avoid Immediate Biased Decisions**: Direct successive activities from checking sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`) to a decision of rejection (`Reject`) are strictly prohibited. This prevents instantaneous unfavourable decisions based solely on sensitive demographic details, ensuring a buffer via intervening processes like manual review or bias checks. 

This enhanced DECLARE model structure thus helps promote a fair, unbiased, and consistent decision-making process in handling loan applications.
