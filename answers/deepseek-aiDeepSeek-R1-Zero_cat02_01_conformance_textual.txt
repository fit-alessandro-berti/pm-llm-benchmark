To solve this, let us first recall the main steps described in the normative process description:

1. The process always starts with the "Receive order" activity.
2. After receiving an order, the "Check inventory" step should occur next.
3. Based on the result of the inventory check, the process branches into two possible flows:
    
    - If the inventory is sufficient:
        - "Check inventory" should be followed by "Authorize payment."
        - After "Authorize payment," the next step should be "Package items."
        - After "Package items," the next step should be "Ship order."
        - Finally, "Ship order" should be followed by "Close order."
        - Thus, the expected sequence for sufficient inventory would be:
            `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`

    - If the inventory is insufficient:
        - "Check inventory" should be followed by "Cancel order."
        - After "Cancel order," the next step should be "Close order."
        - Thus, the expected sequence for insufficient inventory would be:
            `Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`
    
4. "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
5. "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
6. "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and never after a "Cancel order."
7. "Close order" should be the final activity in all cases.

Based on the given normative process description, any case that deviates from the two main sequences should be identified as a violation. 

### Analyze Case 1:
1. Receive order (2023-10-05 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-05 10:00)
3. Authorize payment (2023-10-05 11:00)
4. Package items (2023-10-05 12:00)
5. Ship order (2023-10-05 13:00)
6. Close order (2023-10-05 14:00)

This case follows the sequence described for the "sufficient inventory" flow:
`Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`
Thus, **Case 1 appears to follow the normative process description for a sufficient inventory scenario**.

### Analyze Case 2:
1. Receive order (2023-10-06 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-06 09:30)
3. Package items (2023-10-06 10:00)
4. Authorize payment (2023-10-06 10:30)
5. Ship order (2023-10-06 11:00)
6. Close order (2023-10-06 11:30)

The sequence here is:
`Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`

Based on the normative process description:
- "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items." However, in this case, "Authorize payment" occurs after "Package items."
- "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment." Here it appears before.
- "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items," which is true here, but "Package items" itself should only occur after "Authorize payment," so "Ship order" should still only be done after "Authorize payment" and "Package items" in that order.

This makes **Case 2 a violation of the normative process description**. The "Package items" should not happen before "Authorize payment." 

### Analyze Case 3:
1. Receive order (2023-10-07 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-07 09:20)
3. Authorize payment (2023-10-07 09:40)
4. Cancel order (2023-10-07 10:00)
5. Ship order (2023-10-07 10:30)
6. Close order (2023-10-07 11:00)

The sequence here is:
`Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order`

Based on the normative process description:
- After "Check inventory," if the inventory is insufficient, the next step should be "Cancel order." However, it seems that "Authorize payment" was performed first here before "Cancel order." This seems a bit unusual because once inventory is checked and found insufficient, the next step should be "Cancel order." However, the description does not explicitly state that "Authorize payment" should not be done if the inventory check leads to a "Cancel order." However, it makes little sense to authorize payment if you are going to cancel the order. It seems like a part of the "sufficient inventory" flow has been mixed here.
- Another important point here is that "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items." However, "Package items" is completely absent here. Also, "Ship order" should never occur after "Cancel order." 

This makes **Case 3 a violation of the normative process description**. It seems that the order was canceled, yet "Ship order" was still executed. 

### Analyze Case 4:
1. Receive order (2023-10-08 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-08 09:10)
3. Cancel order (2023-10-08 09:20)
4. Close order (2023-10-08 09:50)

The sequence here is:
`Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`

This case follows the sequence described for the "insufficient inventory" flow:
`Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`
Thus, **Case 4 appears to follow the normative process description for an insufficient inventory scenario**.

### Analyze Case 5:
1. Receive order (2023-10-09 09:00)
2. Check inventory (2023-10-09 10:00)
3. Authorize payment (2023-10-09 10:30)
4. Ship order (2023-10-09 11:00)
5. Close order (2023-10-09 11:30)

The sequence here is:
`Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`

Based on the normative process description:
- After "Authorize payment," the next step should be "Package items" before "Ship order." However, in this case, "Package items" is completely missing.

This makes **Case 5 a violation of the normative process description**. The "Package items" step should occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order," which is not followed here.

### Summary of Violations:

**Case 2:**
- Violation: "Package items" should occur after "Authorize payment," not before. The order here should be "Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order."

**Case 3:**
- Violations:
  - "Authorize payment" seems to be done even though the order was canceled (which usually happens if the inventory check shows insufficient stock).
  - "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order," and should only occur if "Package items" has been done. Any "Cancel order" should be followed only by "Close order," so "Ship order" is out of place here.

**Case 5:**
- Violation: "Package items" should occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order," but the "Package items" step is completely missing.

Based on this reasoning, cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process description. Case 1 and case 4 appear to follow the described process correctly.

\boxed{
### Identified Violations

**Case 1:**
- Appears to follow the normative process description for a sufficient inventory scenario.

**Case 2:**
- **Violation**: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which should be the other way around.
- **Expected sequence for sufficient inventory should be**: `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`.

**Case 3:**
- **Violations**:
  - "Authorize payment" is performed even though the order was later canceled.
  - "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order" and should only occur after "Package items," which is missing here.
  - **Expected sequence for insufficient inventory should be**: `Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`.

**Case 4:**
- Appears to follow the normative process description for an insufficient inventory scenario.

**Case 5:**
- **Violation**: "Package items" step is completely missing. The step should be: `Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`.
