### Justification for Renaming Activities:

#### **1. "Verify Documents"  "Initial Document Verification" / "Re-verify Documents"**
- **Contextual Clues**:  
  - The first occurrence of "Verify Documents" in every case (C001, C002, C003) represents the **initial identity check** after request submission.  
  - The second occurrence in C001 (after `Submit Additional`) and C003 (after `Adjust Account`) represents a **re-verification** after corrections.  
- **Naming Rationale**:  
  - `Initial Document Verification`: Clearly denotes the first identity check.  
  - `Re-verify Documents`: Highlights that documents are re-examined post-correction.  
- **Why Rename?**  
  Prevents ambiguity by distinguishing between the first verification and subsequent checks triggered by external/internal fixes.

#### **2. "Call Customer"  "Request Missing Documents" / "Clarify Discrepancy" / "Confirm Adjustments" / "Request Customer Return"**
- **Contextual Clues**:  
  - **C001**: Triggered by incomplete verification to gather missing data (`Request Missing Documents`).  
  - **C002**:  
    - First call: Clarifies account discrepancies before adjustments (`Clarify Discrepancy`).  
    - Second call: Confirms after internal fixes (`Confirm Adjustments`).  
  - **C003**: Triggered by customer absence to return for in-person action (`Request Customer Return`).  
- **Naming Rationale**:  
  - Each name explicitly describes the **purpose and timing** of the call (e.g., data collection vs. confirmation).  
- **Why Rename?**  
  The same activity ("Call Customer") serves vastly different roles in each case. Renaming reveals the **intent** behind the call (e.g., data retrieval vs. confirmation vs. procedural coordination).

### Key Insights:
- **Process Flow Clarity**: Renamed activities expose **dependencies** between steps (e.g., `Re-verify Documents` only occurs after corrective actions like `Submit Additional` or `Adjust Account`).  
- **Resource Differentiation**: While resources vary (e.g., `FrontlineAgent` vs. `BranchOfficer`), the renaming focuses on **activity purpose** to avoid conflating roles with actions.  
- **Ambiguity Resolution**:  
  - "Verify Documents" could imply any identity check; the new names specify if it’s initial or corrective.  
  - "Call Customer" could mean anything from data gathering to procedural follow-up; the new names clarify the goal.  

This approach ensures the log accurately reflects the **contextual nuances** of each activity, enabling precise process analysis.
