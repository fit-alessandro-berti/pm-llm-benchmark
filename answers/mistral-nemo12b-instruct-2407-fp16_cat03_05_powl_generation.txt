Here's a Python code snippet using pm4py to create a POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) model for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process. This example includes activities, choices, and loops:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities (transitions)
purchase_request = Transition(label="Purchase Request")
approve_pr = Transition(label="Approve Purchase Request")
reject_pr = SilentTransition()
order_goods = Transition(label="Order Goods")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
pay_invoice = Transition(label="Pay Invoice")

# Define choice (XOR operator)
approve_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approve_pr, reject_pr])

# Define loop (LOOP operator) for receiving goods and paying invoice
loop_receive_pay = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[
        receive_goods,
        pay_invoice,
        SilentTransition()  # Silent transition to allow looping back to 'Receive Goods'
    ]
)

# Define partial order (StrictPartialOrder)
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[purchase_request, approve_choice, order_goods, loop_receive_pay])

# Add edges to define the execution order
root.order.add_edge(purchase_request, approve_choice)
root.order.add_edge(approve_choice, order_goods)
root.order.add_edge(order_goods, loop_receive_pay)

# Print the POWL model (for visualization purposes)
print(root)
```

This code creates a Purchase-to-Pay process with the following steps:

1. A purchase request is made.
2. The purchase request is either approved or rejected.
3. If approved, goods are ordered.
4. Goods are received and invoices are paid in a loop until all goods have been received and all invoices have been paid.

You can visualize this POWL model using pm4py's visualization capabilities:

```python
from pm4py.visualization.powl import visualizer

gviz = visualizer.apply(root)
gviz
```

This will generate an interactive graph representation of the Purchase-to-Pay process.
