Here's a Python code snippet using `pm4py` to create a POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow) model for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process. This example includes activities like 'Order', 'Receive Goods', 'Invoice Approval', and 'Payment'. It also contains a choice between 'Express Delivery' and regular delivery, as well as a loop for reordering.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import (
    StrictPartialOrder,
    OperatorPOWL,
    Transition,
    SilentTransition,
)
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities (transitions)
order = Transition(label="Order")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
invoice_approval = Transition(label="Invoice Approval")
payment = Transition(label="Payment")

# Define silent activity
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define choice between Express Delivery and Regular Delivery
delivery_choice = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[
        Transition(label="Express Delivery"),
        Transition(label="Regular Delivery"),
    ],
)

# Define loop for reordering (repeatedly order goods)
reorder_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[order])

# Create the main POWL model
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        # Order goods
        order,
        # Choose delivery method
        delivery_choice,
        # Receive goods (after both possible deliveries)
        receive_goods,
        # Approve invoice
        invoice_approval,
        # Make payment
        payment,
        # Reorder loop (optional, can be executed after payment or invoice approval)
        reorder_loop,
    ]
)

# Add partial order edges
root.order.add_edge(order, delivery_choice)
root.order.add_edge(delivery_choice, receive_goods)
root.order.add_edge(receive_goods, invoice_approval)
root.order.add_edge(invoice_approval, payment)
root.order.add_edge(payment, reorder_loop)  # Optional: Reorder after payment
root.order.add_edge(invoice_approval, reorder_loop)  # Optional: Reorder if invoice is rejected

# Print the POWL model (for visualization)
pm4py.view_model_tree(root)
```

This code creates a POWL model for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process with choices and loops. You can visualize the created model by uncommenting the `pm4py.view_model_tree(root)` line at the end of the script. Make sure you have pm4py installed (`pip install pm4py`).
