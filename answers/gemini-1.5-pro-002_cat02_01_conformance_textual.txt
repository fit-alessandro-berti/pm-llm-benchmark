**Violating Cases:**

* **Case 2:** This case violates the normative process because "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment." The description clearly states that payment authorization must happen before packaging.

* **Case 3:** This case has multiple violations:
    * "Cancel order" is followed by "Ship order," which is explicitly forbidden by the description.  An order cannot be shipped after cancellation.
    * "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order", implying that the order had sufficient inventory and then was cancelled even after payment authorization. There isn't necessarily a stated rule about this in the normative process description, but it is implied to be illogical to authorize payment and then cancel when the stated reason for canceling is insufficient inventory.

* **Case 5:** This case violates the process because it's missing the "Package items" activity between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." The description mandates that items must be packaged before shipping.


**Summary of Violations:**

* **Case 2:** Incorrect order of "Package items" and "Authorize payment."
* **Case 3:** "Ship order" after "Cancel order"; "Authorize payment" preceding "Cancel order" in a presumed insufficient inventory scenario.
* **Case 5:** Missing "Package items" activity.


Case 1 and Case 4 adhere to the normative process description, with Case 1 representing the successful fulfillment scenario and Case 4 representing the cancellation scenario.
