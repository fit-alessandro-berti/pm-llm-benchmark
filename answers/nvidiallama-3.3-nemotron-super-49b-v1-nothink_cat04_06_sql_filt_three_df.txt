### Solution: DuckDB SQL Query

To solve this problem efficiently in DuckDB, we'll break down the solution into steps and then combine them into a single query. This involves identifying the sequences, checking the timing condition, and finally excluding those cases from the full event log.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation and Query

#### **1. Identifying Sequences and Timing Condition**

First, we identify the sequences and check the timing condition. We use a subquery to filter case IDs based on the given conditions.

```sql
WITH -- Common Table Expression to identify problematic case_ids
problematic_cases AS (
  SELECT 
    e1.case_id
  FROM 
    event_log e1
  JOIN 
    event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp
  JOIN 
    event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e2.timestamp < e3.timestamp
  WHERE 
    -- Exact sequence required
    e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    -- Check for direct succession (no events in between)
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM event_log e4
      WHERE e4.case_id = e1.case_id
        AND e4.timestamp > e1.timestamp
        AND e4.timestamp < e2.timestamp
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM event_log e5
      WHERE e5.case_id = e2.case_id
        AND e5.timestamp > e2.timestamp
        AND e5.timestamp < e3.timestamp
    )
    -- Time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' > 5 days
    AND (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 day'
)
```

#### **2. Excluding Problematic Cases from Event Log**

Now, exclude these cases from the full event log.

```sql
SELECT 
  * -- Select all columns for simplicity; adjust as needed
FROM 
  event_log el
WHERE 
  -- Exclude cases identified in the CTE
  el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problematic_cases)
ORDER BY 
  el.case_id, -- Group by case for readability
  el.timestamp; -- Ordered by timestamp for understanding the process flow
```

#### **Combined Query**

Here's the combined query for direct execution:

```sql
WITH problematic_cases AS (
  SELECT 
    e1.case_id
  FROM 
    event_log e1
  JOIN 
    event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp
  JOIN 
    event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e2.timestamp < e3.timestamp
  WHERE 
    e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM event_log e4
      WHERE e4.case_id = e1.case_id
        AND e4.timestamp > e1.timestamp
        AND e4.timestamp < e2.timestamp
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM event_log e5
      WHERE e5.case_id = e2.case_id
        AND e5.timestamp > e2.timestamp
        AND e5.timestamp < e3.timestamp
    )
    AND (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 day'
)
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  event_log el
WHERE 
  el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problematic_cases)
ORDER BY 
  el.case_id,
  el.timestamp;
```

### Advice for Execution and Optimization

- **Indexing**: Ensure that `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` are indexed in your `event_log` table for better performance, especially if the table is large.
  
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_case_id ON event_log (case_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_activity ON event_log (activity);
  CREATE INDEX idx_timestamp ON event_log (timestamp);
  ```

- **CTE vs. Derived Table**: The query uses a CTE for readability. For very large datasets, compare performance with a derived table (subquery) in the `WHERE` clause.

- ** EXISTS vs. NOT IN**: The query uses `NOT EXISTS` for excluding intermediate events, which is generally more efficient than `NOT IN` when dealing with subqueries that might return `NULL` values. The outer `NOT IN` is used for simplicity assuming `case_id` is not nullable in `problematic_cases`; consider `NOT EXISTS` or `LEFT JOIN` with `IS NULL` check for more complex scenarios.

- **Adjustments for Specific Needs**: If you only need specific columns, replace `*` with the column names you're interested in to reduce the data transferred and processed.

### Example Use Case

Assuming your `event_log` looks something like this:

| case_id | activity                  | timestamp           |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 1       | Approve Purchase Requisition | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| 1       | Create Order               | 2023-01-01 10:05:00 |
| 1       | Confirm Order              | 2023-01-06 10:00:00 |
| 2       | Approve Purchase Requisition | 2023-01-05 12:00:00 |
| 2       | Create Order               | 2023-01-05 12:10:00 |
| 2       | Review Order               | 2023-01-05 12:15:00 |
| 2       | Confirm Order              | 2023-01-05 12:20:00 |
| 3       | Approve Purchase Requisition | 2023-01-10 14:00:00 |
| 3       | Create Order               | 2023-01-10 14:05:00 |
| 3       | Confirm Order              | 2023-01-11 14:00:00 |

Running the combined query would exclude `case_id = 1` because it matches both the sequence and the timing condition (`> 5 days` between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'). The result would include all events from `case_id = 2` and `case_id = 3`, as `case_id = 2` does not match the sequence exactly (has 'Review Order' in between) and `case_id = 3` does not exceed the 5-day threshold.
