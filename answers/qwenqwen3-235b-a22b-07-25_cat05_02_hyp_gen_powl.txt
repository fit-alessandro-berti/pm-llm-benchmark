# Analysis of the POWL Process Model Anomalies in the Insurance Claims Handling Process

The provided POWL (Partially Ordered While Language) process model for an insurance claim handling workflow contains several **structural and behavioral anomalies** that deviate from the intended sequential flow. These anomalies may reflect modeling errors, incomplete business logic implementation, or actual deviations observed in real execution traces. Below is a comprehensive analysis addressing the three tasks:

---

## 1. **Identification of Anomalies in the POWL Model**

### **Anomaly 1: Loop Between Evaluate (E) and Approve (P)**
```python
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[E, P])
```
- The loop structure allows repeated execution of **Evaluate Claim (E)** followed by **Approve Claim (P)**.
- This implies a claim can be **approved multiple times**, possibly after re-evaluation.
- In a standard insurance process, a claim should be evaluated once (or with revisions), approved once, and then closed. Repeated approvals suggest either:
  - A flaw in modeling (e.g., confusing iterative evaluation with repeated approval).
  - A design allowing cyclical rework, but without a clear exit condition.

>  **Risk**: Could lead to inconsistent state (e.g., multiple approval records), inflated processing times, or even fraudulent cycles.

---

### **Anomaly 2: XOR Choice to Skip Customer Notification (N)**
```python
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[N, skip])
```
- The use of an XOR gate with a silent transition (`skip`) means that **"Notify Customer" is optional**.
- While some systems may allow skipping notifications under certain conditions (e.g., automated denials), making it a **structural choice in the model** suggests it's a common or accepted path.
- However, in regulated domains like insurance, **customer notification is typically mandatory** after key decisions (approval/denial).

>  **Risk**: Violation of compliance or transparency requirements; customers unaware of claim status.

---

### **Anomaly 3: Premature Claim Closure via Direct Edge from Assign Adjuster (A) to Close (C)**
```python
root.order.add_edge(A, C)  # Allows closing claim possibly prematurely
```
- Despite the intended flow requiring evaluation, approval, and notification before closure, there's a **direct partial order edge from A  C**.
- Combined with the lack of enforced ordering between `xor` and `C`, this allows:
  - Claim closure **without evaluation or approval**.
  - Closure **before notification**.
- Since `StrictPartialOrder` does not enforce full sequencing, multiple paths can lead to `C` without completing prior required steps.

>  **Risk**: Claims closed prematurely—possibly without being processed—leading to customer dissatisfaction and regulatory issues.

---

### **Anomaly 4: Lack of Synchronization After XOR Before Closure**
```python
# No edge from xor to C
# But C is present in the node list and connected from A
```
- There is no explicit ordering constraint ensuring that the outcome of the XOR (i.e., whether notification occurred or was skipped) must complete **before** closure.
- This creates a **race condition or concurrency anomaly**, where closure might occur independently of the notification decision.

>  **Risk**: Closure recorded before notification is sent, leading to inaccurate audit trails.

---

## 2. **Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Might Exist**

| Anomaly | Possible Explanation |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Loop between E and P** | - Business rule change: Claims can be re-evaluated and re-approved after new evidence. However, model incorrectly allows looping *after* approval instead of before.<br>- Misinterpretation of "rework" paths in process mining: If real data shows back-and-forth between evaluation and approval, the modeler may have naively encoded it as a formal loop. |
| **Optional Notification (N or skip)** | - Technical workaround: System automatically closes small claims without explicit notification.<br>- Departmental misalignment: IT assumed notifications were optional; compliance team expected them always.<br>- Cost-cutting measure: Reduce communication overhead for high-volume, low-value claims. |
| **Direct A  C Edge (Premature Closure)** | - Exception handling not properly modeled: Adjusters may close invalid claims immediately after assignment (e.g., duplicate or fraudulent). But instead of a proper exception sub-process, a shortcut was added.<br>- Workflow engine limitation: The tool used doesn't support exception flows, so modellers added direct edges. |
| **Missing xor  C Constraint** | - Inadequate validation during model design: The modeler forgot to enforce sequencing after conditional logic.<br>- Assumption that all paths naturally converge before closure, which isn’t true in partial orders. |

## 3. **Proposed Database Queries to Verify Anomalies**

We now propose **SQL queries** against the PostgreSQL schema (`claims`, `adjusters`, `claim_events`) to **detect actual occurrences** of these anomalies in historical event data.

---

###  **Query 1: Detect Claims Closed Without Evaluation or Approval**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce.activity IN ('Evaluate Claim', 'E')
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce.activity IN ('Approve Claim', 'P')
)
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce.activity IN ('Close Claim', 'C')
);
```
>  **Purpose**: Checks for claims closed (`C`) without any `Evaluate (E)` or `Approve (P)` events — validates Anomaly 3 (premature closure).

---

###  **Query 2: Identify Claims Approved Multiple Times**

```sql
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS approval_count
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('Approve Claim', 'P')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY approval_count DESC;
```
>  **Purpose**: Finds claims with more than one approval — validates Anomaly 1 (loop effect).

---

###  **Query 3: Find Claims Closed Without Customer Notification**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce.activity IN ('Close Claim', 'C')
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce.activity IN ('Notify Customer', 'N')
);
```
>  **Purpose**: Detects cases where `N` was skipped — validates Anomaly 2 (XOR skip path).

---

###  **Query 4: Claims Where Closure Precedes Approval or Notification**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id
  AND ce_close.activity IN ('Close Claim', 'C')
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce_appr
    WHERE ce_appr.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce_appr.activity IN ('Approve Claim', 'P')
      AND ce_appr.timestamp > ce_close.timestamp
)
OR EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce_notif
    WHERE ce_notif.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce_notif.activity IN ('Notify Customer', 'N')
      AND ce_notif.timestamp > ce_close.timestamp
);
```
>  **Purpose**: Identifies temporal violations — closure before approval or notification. Confirms **temporal inconsistency** due to weak ordering (Anomalies 3 & 4).

---

###  **Query 5: Correlation Between Adjuster Region and Premature Closure**

```sql
SELECT a.region, COUNT(*) AS premature_closure_count
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON c.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity IN ('Assign Adjuster', 'A')
JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity IN ('Close Claim', 'C')
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_eval ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity IN ('Evaluate Claim', 'E')
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce_assign.resource = a.name  -- assuming resource is adjuster name
WHERE ce_close.timestamp < (
    SELECT MIN(ce_eval.timestamp)
    FROM claim_events ce_eval
    WHERE ce_eval.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce_eval.activity IN ('Evaluate Claim', 'E')
)
   OR ce_eval.claim_id IS NULL
GROUP BY a.region
ORDER BY premature_closure_count DESC;
```
>  **Purpose**: Tests hypothesis that certain regions (teams) are more likely to close claims prematurely — could indicate localized practices or training gaps.

##  Summary and Recommendations

| Issue | Evidence Needed | Action |
|------|------------------|--------|
| **Unnecessary Loops (E-P)** | High frequency of multi-approval claims | Restructure model: Replace loop with optional re-evaluation branch before single approval |
| **Skipped Notifications** | Many claims closed without `N` | Enforce mandatory notification in model; add logging |
| **Premature Closure** | Claims closed before evaluation/approval | Remove direct `A  C` edge; introduce explicit exception path (e.g., "Reject & Close") |
| **Weak Sequencing** | Closure before dependent steps | Enforce strict ordering: `xor  C` must be required; use total order or synchronization |

---

###  Recommended Fix to the POWL Model

Replace the current model with a **well-structured sequence**:
```python
# Corrected structure
corrected_process = Sequence(
    R,
    A,
    Loop(  # Only allow re-evaluation if needed
        Sequence(
            E,
            Choice(
                P,
                Deny  # If denial is possible
            )
        ),
        max_iterations=2  # Optional: limit rework
    ),
    N,  # Mandatory notification
    C   # Final closure
)
```

Alternatively, use **process conformance checking** (via PM4Py) to compare the model with actual logs and identify deviations statistically.

By combining **model analysis**, **hypothesis generation**, and **database validation**, organizations can move from abstract process models to **data-driven process improvement**, ensuring both correctness and compliance.
