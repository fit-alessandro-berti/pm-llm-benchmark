To identify unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group based on the provided process variants, we need to compare several aspects:

### Frequency of Process Variants:
1. **Frequent Rejection for Protected Group:**
   - The protected group shows a higher frequency in being rejected at various stages compared to the unprotected group.
     - For example, `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant` has a much higher frequency (484) in the protected group versus 674 in the unprotected group. However, both groups have relatively high rejection rates early on, indicating that rejections are common across the board.
     - But the frequency of `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant` is much higher in the protected group (793) than in the unprotected group (1022). This suggests that there might be a bias or more stringent criteria applied to the protected group during the extensive screening phase.

2. **Success Rate and Length of Tenancy:**
   - The frequency and performance times for successful tenancies in the protected group are often lower, and these processes tend to have higher durations.
     - For instance, `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent` followed by cancellations or missed rent payments are observed more in the protected group (lower frequencies but higher performance times). This indicates that even when the process is successful, it takes longer to complete and often leads to quicker terminations compared to the unprotected group.
     - On the other hand, the unprotected group has a higher frequency of processes leading to stable tenancies (`Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent` followed by longer sequences of pay rent events).

### Performance Time (Execution Time):
- **Higher Rejection Times:**
  - Processes ending in rejection for the protected group often take longer (`performance = 540011.977`, `performance = 449997.746`), suggesting that even though rejections occur, they go through more prolonged and possibly unnecessary screening phases.
  
- **High Success but Shorter Tenancy for Protected Group:**
  - When the protected group does make it to signing a contract (`Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract`), they tend to experience higher cancellation rates (`Tenant Cancels Appartment`) or missed rent payments leading to eviction (`Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant`). This pattern indicates that successful tenancies are less stable for the protected group and often shorter, suggesting a possible systemic issue.

### Conclusion:
The main unfair differences identified are:

1. **Increased Rejections:** The protected group faces higher rejection rates especially during the extensive screening phase.
2. **Longer Screening Processes Before Rejection:** Even when rejected, the processes for the protected group tend to be longer and more drawn-out compared to the unprotected group.
3. **Less Stable Tenancies After Approval:** Successful tenancy processes in the protected group often lead to shorter periods before cancellation or eviction, suggesting less stability and support.

These patterns suggest potential biases or systemic barriers that make it harder for members of the protected group to successfully become tenants with stable tenures compared to the unprotected group.
