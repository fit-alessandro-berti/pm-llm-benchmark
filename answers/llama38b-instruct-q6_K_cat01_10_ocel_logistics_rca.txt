Based on the provided event log data, here are some potential root causes for the performance issues in the process:

1. **Create Package** step is a bottleneck:
	* The "create package" step has a high frequency of events (1823) and objects (1128), which indicates that it is a critical step in the process.
	* The duration of this step is also relatively long, with an average duration of 25911.20 seconds for the object-centric event log and 68577.23 seconds for the package object type.
2. **Send Package** step has high frequency but short duration:
	* The "send package" step has a high frequency of events (1741) and objects, indicating that it is a common step in the process.
	* However, its average duration is relatively short (7082.67 seconds), which may not be contributing to performance issues as much as other steps.
3. **Package Delivered** step has long duration:
	* The "package delivered" step has an average duration of 18730.77 seconds for the object-centric event log and 66493.91 seconds for the package object type, indicating that it may be taking a significant amount of time to complete.
4. **Pay Order** step is related to multiple other steps:
	* The "pay order" step is connected to several other steps, including "create package", "place order", and "send package". This could indicate that there are dependencies or conflicts between these steps, which may be contributing to performance issues.

To further analyze and identify the root causes of the performance issues, it would be helpful to:

1. Investigate the distribution of event frequencies and durations to see if there are any outliers or anomalies.
2. Analyze the relationships between events and objects to identify any potential bottlenecks or dependencies.
3. Explore the data to determine if there are any correlations between specific steps or objects that may be contributing to performance issues.

Please note that these findings are based on the provided event log data and may not reflect the actual root causes of the performance issues in the process. Further analysis and investigation would be necessary to confirm the findings and identify potential solutions.
