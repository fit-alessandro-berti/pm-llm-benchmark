Sure, here are the opposite concepts (antonyms) and more general concepts for each of the given Petri net terms:

1. **Source Place**
   - Opposite: Sink Place (a place with no input transitions)
   - More General: Place (any node in a Petri net that can hold tokens)

2. **Immediate Transition**
   - Opposite: Delayed Transition (a transition that doesn't fire immediately after enabling)
   - More General: Transition (any node in a Petri net that connects places and has a firing rule)

3. **Live Transition**
   - Opposite: Dead Transition (a transition that cannot fire due to insufficient tokens)
   - More General: Firable Transition (any transition that can potentially fire given sufficient tokens)

4. **Bounded Net**
   - Opposite: Unbounded Net (a net where at least one place has an unbounded number of tokens)
   - More General: Well-formed Net (a net with no self-loops or loops on places, and no isolated nodes)

5. **Free Choice Net**
   - Opposite: Structured Net (a net that is not free choice, e.g., it contains inhibitor arcs or priorities)
   - More General: Petri Net (any directed bipartite graph with places and transitions connected by arcs)
