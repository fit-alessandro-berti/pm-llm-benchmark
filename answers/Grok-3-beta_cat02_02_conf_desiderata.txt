Let’s analyze the event log step-by-step based on the Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules) and Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict) constraints provided. I’ll evaluate each case for violations of the strict rules, deviations from the desiderata, and offer possible interpretations or justifications where applicable.
1. Analysis of Normative Rule Violations (Strict Rules)
The normative process requires a strict sequence of activities:  
Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform Applicant → [If Approved: Finalize Documentation] → Close Case  
Key constraints: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, Inform Applicant after Loan Decision, Finalize Documentation only if approved and before Close Case, no skipping or reordering steps.
Case 1:
Event Log:
2024-01-10 09:00: Application Received
2024-01-10 09:30: Credit Check
2024-01-10 10:00: Risk Assessment
2024-01-10 11:00: Loan Decision (Approved)
2024-01-10 13:00: Inform Applicant
2024-01-10 13:30: Finalize Documentation
2024-01-10 14:00: Close Case
Analysis:  
The sequence follows the normative order exactly: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case.
The loan is approved, and Finalize Documentation occurs before Close Case, as required.
Conclusion: No normative violations.
Case 2:
Event Log:
2024-01-11 08:00: Application Received
2024-01-11 08:20: Risk Assessment (Violation 1)
2024-01-11 09:00: Credit Check
2024-01-11 09:30: Loan Decision (Rejected)
2024-01-11 10:00: Finalize Documentation (Violation 2)
2024-01-11 10:30: Close Case
Analysis:  
Violation 1: Risk Assessment (08:20) occurs before Credit Check (09:00), which violates the strict rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.
Violation 2: After Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30, Finalize Documentation (10:00) is performed, which is explicitly not allowed when the loan is rejected. The process should have gone directly to Close Case after informing the applicant (though Inform Applicant is missing here—another potential issue, though not explicitly logged).
Additional Note: Inform Applicant is not recorded, which might indicate skipping a required step, though the log could simply be incomplete rather than indicating the step was skipped in practice.
Conclusion: Two normative violations:  
Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order violation).  
Finalize Documentation after rejection (contradictory action).
Case 3:
Event Log:
2024-01-12 09:00: Application Received
2024-01-14 10:00: Credit Check
2024-01-14 11:00: Risk Assessment
2024-01-14 12:00: Loan Decision (Approved)
2024-01-16 15:00: Inform Applicant
2024-01-17 09:00: Finalize Documentation
2024-01-17 10:00: Close Case
Analysis:  
The sequence follows the normative order: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case.
The loan is approved, and Finalize Documentation occurs before Close Case, as required.
Conclusion: No normative violations.
2. Analysis of Desiderata Deviations (Recommended Practices)
The desiderata include:  
Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received (recommended).  
Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision (recommended).  
Follow-up Call before Close Case (encouraged, but not required).
These are not strict rules, so deviations are suboptimal but not severe violations.
Case 1:
Timing Analysis:  
Credit Check (09:30) is 30 minutes after Application Received (09:00) → Within 24 hours (satisfied).
Inform Applicant (13:00) is 2 hours after Loan Decision (11:00) → Within 48 hours (satisfied).
Follow-up Call: Not recorded → Missed, but not required.
Conclusion: No desiderata deviations. The process adheres to timing recommendations, though it skips the optional Follow-up Call.
Case 2:
Timing Analysis:  
Credit Check (09:00) is 1 hour after Application Received (08:00) → Within 24 hours (satisfied).
Inform Applicant: Not recorded. Loan Decision (09:30) to Close Case (10:30) is 1 hour, but without Inform Applicant logged, we can’t assess the 48-hour rule directly. Assuming it was skipped, this could be a normative issue (see above), but as a desideratum, timing isn’t assessable here.
Follow-up Call: Not recorded → Missed, but not required.
Conclusion: No clear desiderata deviations assessable due to missing Inform Applicant data. The Credit Check timing is fine, and the Follow-up Call is optional.
Case 3:
Timing Analysis:  
Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00) is 49 hours after Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00) → Exceeds 24 hours (deviation).  
Calculation: Jan 12, 09:00 to Jan 13, 09:00 = 24 hours; to Jan 14, 10:00 = 49 hours.
Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00) is 51 hours after Loan Decision (2024-01-14 12:00) → Exceeds 48 hours (deviation).  
Calculation: Jan 14, 12:00 to Jan 15, 12:00 = 24 hours; to Jan 16, 12:00 = 48 hours; to Jan 16, 15:00 = 51 hours.
Follow-up Call: Not recorded → Missed, but not required.
Conclusion: Two desiderata deviations:  
Credit Check exceeds the recommended 24-hour window.  
Inform Applicant exceeds the recommended 48-hour window.
These are suboptimal but not severe, as they are recommendations, not rules.
3. Interpretations and Justifications
Case 1:
Observation: Fully compliant with normative rules and desiderata (except the optional Follow-up Call).
Interpretation: This case represents an ideal execution of the process, likely handled by an efficient team or automated system adhering to both strict and recommended guidelines.
Case 2:
Observation: Major normative violations (Risk Assessment before Credit Check, Finalize Documentation after rejection).
Interpretation/Justification:  
Risk Assessment before Credit Check: This could be due to human error, a misunderstanding of the process, or an attempt to expedite the case by prematurely assessing risk based on incomplete data (e.g., assuming credit data was already available informally). Alternatively, it might reflect a system glitch or mislogged timestamp.
Finalize Documentation after Rejection: This might indicate a procedural oversight or a miscommunication where staff assumed rejection didn’t preclude documentation (e.g., preparing a rejection notice mistaken as "documentation"). It could also suggest a lack of training or enforcement of the rejection workflow.
Case 3:
Observation: No normative violations, but delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant exceed desiderata timing.
Interpretation/Justification:  
Credit Check Delay (49 hours): This could be due to a backlog of applications, third-party delays in providing credit data, or weekend scheduling (Jan 12 was a Friday; Jan 14 was a Sunday—processing might have been deferred to Monday).
Inform Applicant Delay (51 hours): This might reflect staffing shortages, prioritization of other tasks, or the applicant being unavailable, pushing notification to a later time. Since it’s post-decision, it doesn’t affect the outcome, aligning with its non-strict status.
No Follow-up Call: Likely skipped due to time constraints or deemed unnecessary if the applicant was already satisfied with the outcome.
Summary
Normative Violations (Strict Rules):  
Case 1: None.  
Case 2:  
Risk Assessment before Credit Check.  
Finalize Documentation after rejection.
Case 3: None.
Desiderata Deviations (Recommended Practices):  
Case 1: None (Follow-up Call skipped, but optional).  
Case 2: None assessable (Inform Applicant missing, but timing otherwise fine).  
Case 3:  
Credit Check > 24 hours after Application Received (49 hours).  
Inform Applicant > 48 hours after Loan Decision (51 hours).  
Follow-up Call skipped (optional).
These deviations in Case 3 are suboptimal but not severe, as they are recommendations rather than requirements.
Interpretations:  
Case 1 is a model process execution.  
Case 2’s violations suggest errors or poor oversight.  
Case 3’s delays likely stem from operational constraints, not intentional disregard.
