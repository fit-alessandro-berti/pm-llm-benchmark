To solve this task, I will outline a step-by-step approach to achieve the required result using DuckDB SQL queries.

**Step 1: Extract the ordered sequence of activities per case**

To get the ordered sequence of activities per case, we will use the following DuckDB SQL query:
```sql
SELECT case_id, 
       activity, 
       @prev_time = @prev_time + row_timestamp,
       @prev_activity = @prev_activity || activity,
       @next_time = @prev_time + row_timestamp,
       @next_activity = @prev_activity || activity,
       @prev_time > timestamp
  FROM
    event_log
  CROSS JOIN
    LAG(row_timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @prev_time,
    LAG(activity) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @prev_activity,
    LAG(timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @prev_timestamp,
    LAG(@next_time) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_time,
    LAG(@next_activity) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_activity
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```
This query assumes that you have the following DuckDB tables and columns:

- `event_log`: 
  - `case_id`
  - `activity`
  - `timestamp`

**Explanation:**

- The query starts with a `CROSS JOIN` to join the `event_log` table with itself for each row. This is necessary to calculate the ordered sequence of activities per case.

- The `LAG` window function is used to access the previous row's timestamp and activity. This is needed to calculate the `@prev_time` and `@prev_activity` variables.

- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by `timestamp` for each case, ensuring that the ordered sequence is maintained.

**Step 2: Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants**

To group cases by their complete activity sequence, we will use the following DuckDB SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
  case_id,
  activity,
  @prev_activity = LAG(activity),
  @prev_timestamp = timestamp,
  LAG(activity) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
  LAG(timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
FROM
  event_log
CROSS JOIN
  LAG(next_activity) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_activity_prev,
  LAG(next_timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_timestamp_prev
ORDER BY 
  case_id,
  @prev_activity,
  @next_activity_prev,
  @next_timestamp_prev;
```
This query assumes that the `activity` column has the same ordering as the `timestamp` column.

**Explanation:**

- The query uses `LAG` to access the previous row's activity and timestamp for each case.

- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by `activity` and `timestamp` for each case.

**Step 3: Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants by their frequency**

To count the frequency of each variant, we will use the following DuckDB SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
  variant,
  COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM
  (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      @prev_activity = LAG(activity),
      @prev_timestamp = timestamp,
      LAG(activity) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
      LAG(timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
    FROM
      event_log
    CROSS JOIN
      LAG(next_activity) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_activity_prev,
      LAG(next_timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_timestamp_prev
    CROSS JOIN
      LAG(@next_activity_prev) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_activity_prev_prev,
      LAG(@next_timestamp_prev) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_timestamp_prev_prev
    ORDER BY 
      case_id,
      @prev_activity,
      @next_activity_prev,
      @next_timestamp_prev
  ) subquery
GROUP BY 
  variant
ORDER BY 
  freq DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
This query first counts the frequency of each variant using a subquery.

**Explanation:**

- The subquery uses `LAG` to access the previous row's activity, timestamp, and variant for each case.

- The subquery is then grouped by the variant and ordered by frequency in descending order.

- Finally, the `LIMIT 10` clause limits the top 10 variants with the highest frequency.

**Step 4: Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants**

To return the events from the top K variants, we will use the following DuckDB SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
  event_log.event_id,
  event_log.activity,
  event_log.timestamp
FROM
  event_log
WHERE 
  case_id IN (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      @prev_activity,
      @next_activity_prev,
      @next_timestamp_prev
    FROM
      (
        SELECT 
          case_id,
          activity,
          @prev_activity = LAG(activity),
          @prev_timestamp = timestamp,
          LAG(activity) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
          LAG(timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
        FROM
          event_log
        CROSS JOIN
          LAG(next_activity) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_activity_prev,
          LAG(next_timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_timestamp_prev
        CROSS JOIN
          LAG(@next_activity_prev) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_activity_prev_prev,
          LAG(@next_timestamp_prev) OVER (ORDER BY timestamp) AS @next_timestamp_prev_prev
      ) subquery
    GROUP BY 
      case_id,
      activity
  )
ORDER BY 
  event_id, timestamp;
```
This query assumes that the `event_log` table has an `event_id` column that uniquely identifies each event.

**Explanation:**

- The subquery returns a list of `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` values that correspond to the top K variants.

- The outer query then filters the original event log to include only events from cases that are part of these top K variants.
