Certainly! Below are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, reflecting different approaches to handling the cultural fit and community affiliation check.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model includes an XOR branching where one path includes a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that can give an advantage to certain candidates.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops and branches
loop_activities = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Assemble the main POWL model
root_with_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_activities, SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_activities)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(loop_activities, SkillAssessment)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_xor)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model, all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation process, ensuring no special treatment based on community affiliation.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops
loop_activities = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Assemble the main POWL model
root_without_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_activities, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_activities)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(loop_activities, SkillAssessment)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### Explanation

1. **Model with Bias**: 
   - This model features an XOR branching after the skill assessment. Candidates take either a standard cultural fit evaluation or a community affiliation check, which can favor some applicants based on their affiliations.

2. **Model without Bias**: 
   - This model eliminates any bias by ensuring every candidate undergoes the same cultural fit evaluation after the skill assessment, ensuring a fairer selection process.

These models reflect the subtle differences in handling community affiliations while maintaining the overall structure of the hiring process.
