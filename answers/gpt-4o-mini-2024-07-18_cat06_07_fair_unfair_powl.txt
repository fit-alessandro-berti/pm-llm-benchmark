Here are the two POWL models reflecting the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. The first model includes potential unfairness through community affiliation checks, while the second model standardizes the cultural fit assessment for all applicants.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops and XOR choices
data_completion_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
cultural_fit_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])
hiring_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_completion_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    cultural_fit_choice,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define the order of execution
hiring_process.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completion_loop)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(data_completion_loop, SkillAssessment)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_choice)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_choice, ManagerialReview)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops (for data completeness) and standard flow without XOR
data_completion_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
hiring_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_completion_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define the order of execution
hiring_process.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completion_loop)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(data_completion_loop, SkillAssessment)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
hiring_process.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### Summary

- **Model 1 (With Potential Unfairness):** This model includes an XOR decision point between Cultural Fit and Community Affiliation checks. The presence of the Community Affiliation Check can lead to a biased advantage for certain applicants.
  
- **Model 2 (Without Unfairness):** This model removes the XOR decision and ensures that all applicants go through a standardized Cultural Fit Check without any preferential treatment based on community affiliation.
