To determine which event log exhibits bias and how that bias manifests, let’s analyze the two logs—Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group)—by comparing their processes, attributes, and outcomes. The key attributes to focus on are LocalResident, CommunityGroup, and ScoreAdjustment, as they appear to influence the PreliminaryScore and ultimately the FinalDecision. I’ll break this down step-by-step.
Overview of the Logs
Group A (Protected Group):
All applicants have LocalResident = FALSE and CommunityGroup = None.
No ScoreAdjustment is applied (always 0).
Decisions: 2 Approved (P001: 720, P003: 740), 1 Rejected (P002: 710).
Group B (Unprotected Group):
All applicants have LocalResident = TRUE.
Some belong to a CommunityGroup (e.g., Highland Civic Darts Club), others do not.
ScoreAdjustment is applied for those in a CommunityGroup (+10 Community Boost), otherwise 0.
Decisions: 2 Approved (U001: 730 adjusted from 720, U003: 705 adjusted from 695), 1 Rejected (U002: 710).
Both groups follow the same process: ApplicationReceived → DataValidation → PreliminaryScoring → ManualReview → FinalDecision. The differences lie in the attributes and their impact on scoring and decisions.
Key Observations
LocalResident Attribute:
Group A: All LocalResident = FALSE.
Group B: All LocalResident = TRUE.
This distinction suggests Group B applicants are systematically classified as local residents, while Group A applicants are not. However, the logs don’t show LocalResident directly affecting scores or decisions—its influence seems tied to CommunityGroup eligibility.
CommunityGroup and ScoreAdjustment:
Group A: No applicants belong to a CommunityGroup, and no ScoreAdjustment is applied.
Group B: Applicants in a CommunityGroup (e.g., U001 and U003) receive a +10 ScoreAdjustment labeled as “Community Boost.” Those without (e.g., U002) receive no adjustment.
This adjustment is a clear differentiator: Group B applicants with community affiliation get a score boost, while Group A applicants never do.
Impact on Final Decisions:
Group A: Decisions seem based solely on PreliminaryScore:
P001 (720) → Approved.
P002 (710) → Rejected.
P003 (740) → Approved.
Implied threshold: ~715–720 (710 rejected, 720 approved).
Group B: Decisions reflect adjusted scores when applicable:
U001 (720 → 730) → Approved.
U002 (710 → 710) → Rejected.
U003 (695 → 705) → Approved.
The threshold appears similar (~715), but the +10 boost allows lower initial scores (e.g., 695 in U003) to cross it.
Which Log Exhibits Bias?
Group B’s log exhibits bias. Here’s why:
Bias Manifestation:
The ScoreAdjustment (+10 Community Boost) is exclusively available to Group B applicants who belong to a CommunityGroup. Group A applicants, with CommunityGroup = None, never receive this boost.
This creates a systematic advantage for certain Group B applicants, enabling approvals that wouldn’t occur without the adjustment (e.g., U003: 695 → 705, approved). A Group A applicant with the same initial score (695) would likely be rejected, as no adjustment is possible.
Source of Bias:
The bias stems from the interaction of LocalResident and CommunityGroup. Since only Group B has LocalResident = TRUE, and only they can belong to a CommunityGroup, the scoring system favors Group B applicants with community ties. Group A, lacking these attributes, is structurally excluded from this benefit.
Systematic Differences in Outcomes:
Compare P002 (Group A: 710, Rejected) with U003 (Group B: 695 → 705, Approved). Despite P002 having a higher initial score, U003 is approved due to the boost. This suggests Group B applicants with community affiliation can succeed with lower baseline qualifications, while Group A applicants must meet a higher effective threshold.
The approval rate in this small sample is 2/3 for both groups, but the mechanism differs: Group A relies entirely on raw scores, while Group B benefits from an adjustment that can “rescue” borderline cases.
How Bias Manifests
Preferential Treatment: The +10 boost acts as an affirmative action for Group B’s community-affiliated applicants, skewing the process in their favor. For example, U001 (720 → 730) doesn’t need the boost to pass but gets it anyway, while U003 (695 → 705) depends on it for approval.
Exclusion of Group A: Group A’s lack of access to CommunityGroup or ScoreAdjustment reflects a structural disadvantage. If the boost is tied to LocalResident = TRUE, Group A is systematically excluded from this opportunity.
Threshold Manipulation: The adjustment effectively lowers the required PreliminaryScore for Group B’s community members, creating unequal standards. A score of 695 is sufficient for approval in Group B (with adjustment), but not in Group A.
Discussion
The bias in Group B’s log likely reflects a policy prioritizing local residents with community ties (e.g., Highland Civic Darts Club). While this could be intentional (e.g., to support local engagement), it introduces unfairness by:
Favoring Group B: Applicants like U003 benefit from a boost unavailable to Group A, despite potentially lower initial merit.
Disadvantaging Group A: Non-residents are judged solely on raw scores, with no compensatory mechanism, even if their exclusion from community groups is circumstantial (e.g., not living locally).
Inconsistent Standards: The decision threshold is effectively lower for Group B’s community members, undermining equal evaluation.
This bias could be mitigated by:
Applying a uniform scoring rule (no adjustments) across groups.
Offering Group A an equivalent boost based on other criteria (e.g., socioeconomic factors).
Transparently justifying the Community Boost and its exclusion from Group A.
Conclusion
Group B’s log exhibits bias through the ScoreAdjustment mechanism, which systematically favors local residents with community affiliations. This manifests as an unequal opportunity for approval, giving Group B an advantage that Group A cannot access, leading to systematic differences in final decisions.
