The process tree should strictly preserve the observed order between the main activities:

- RA is always the first activity of a case  
- VF must always be executed immediately after receiving the application  
- AE follows VF (unless the EA loop enters)  
- The “Request Missing Information & re-Validate” (RMI  VF) block is repeatable and optional, and occurs **between AE and AD** whenever it happens  
- AD  SC  AC complete the case in that fixed order.

A compact and behaviour–reflecting tree is consequently:

```
->(
   'RA',
   'VF',
   AE,
   *(
       tau,
       ->('RMI', 'VF')
   ),
   'AD',
   'SC',
   'AC'
 )
```

Explanation of the operators used

-  (sequence) preserves the strict linear ordering among the main stages.  
- * (loop) inserted after AE permits any number (including zero) of the inner block RMI  VF before finally moving on to continuing with AD.

This single tree concisely models the dominant process paths of the log, faithfully allowing both cases that skip the RMI–VF loop and cases that execute it multiple times.
