The provided visualization is a type of Sankey diagram, often used to represent flows and their quantities in various states over time.

Here's a detailed description of the visualization:

1. **Axes and Timeline:**
   - The x-axis represents time, spanning from January 25, 2000, to April 24, 2013.
   - The y-axis is not labeled with specific values but is used to show different states or stages in the process.

2. **Stages:**
   - There are three main stages or states labeled on the y-axis:
     - "Send Fine"
     - "Insert Fine Notification"
     - "Send for Credit Collection"

3. **Flows:**
   - The flows between these stages are represented by lines or bands.
   - The lines start from "Send Fine" and move to "Insert Fine Notification," and then from "Insert Fine Notification" to "Send for Credit Collection."
   - The width of the lines indicates the volume or quantity of the flow at different points in time.

4. **Color Coding:**
   - The lines are color-coded, with grey lines representing the flow from "Send Fine" to "Insert Fine Notification."
   - The lines transition to a reddish hue when moving from "Insert Fine Notification" to "Send for Credit Collection."

5. **Patterns:**
   - The diagram shows a dense and continuous flow of fines being sent and notifications being inserted over the entire period.
   - There is a noticeable pattern of fines transitioning to credit collection, with varying volumes over time.

6. **Interpretation:**
   - The diagram visually represents the process of fines being issued, notifications being sent, and the subsequent credit collection process.
   - The varying widths of the lines over time suggest fluctuations in the number of fines issued, notifications sent, and collections initiated.

This Sankey diagram effectively visualizes the lifecycle of fines from issuance to collection, highlighting the transitions and volumes over a span of more than a decade.
