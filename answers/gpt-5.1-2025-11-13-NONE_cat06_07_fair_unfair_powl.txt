Below are two POWL models, written in the same style as the example and using Python/pm4py constructs.

---

## 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (XOR branch with CommunityAffiliationCheck)

This model includes an XOR after the skill assessment: one branch is the standard cultural fit check, the other is a path that includes a CommunityAffiliationCheck before managerial review, giving affiliated/local candidates a subtle advantage.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Atomic activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affil = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness: execute DataCompletenessCheck,
# then optionally RequestMoreInfo and again DataCompletenessCheck
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_info]
)

# Unfair XOR: either standard cultural fit OR community-based path
standard_path = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[cultural_fit, manager_review],
)
standard_path.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)

community_path = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[community_affil, cultural_fit, manager_review],
)
# Community affiliation evaluated first, then cultural fit, then managerial review
community_path.order.add_edge(community_affil, cultural_fit)
community_path.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)

unfair_xor = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[standard_path, community_path]
)

# Overall process as a partially ordered workflow
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assessment, unfair_xor, final_decision]
)

# Define ordering: ReceiveApplication -> Data Loop -> SkillAssessment -> XOR Branch -> FinalDecision
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, unfair_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(unfair_xor, final_decision)
```

In this **unfair** model, only some applicants traverse the `community_path` branch (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`  `CulturalFitCheck`  `ManagerialReview`), which is where a subtle advantage can be embedded (e.g., uplift in perceived alignment).

## 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness (Single, uniform CulturalFitCheck path)

Here, all applicants follow the same path after the skill assessment: everyone goes through a single cultural fit check and managerial review. No separate community-based path exists.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Atomic activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness (same as in unfair model)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_info]
)

# Single, fair path: everyone follows the same sequence
fair_seq = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[cultural_fit, manager_review],
)
fair_seq.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)

# Overall process: no XOR with community-based branch
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assessment, fair_seq, final_decision]
)

# Define ordering: ReceiveApplication -> Data Loop -> SkillAssessment -> CulturalFit & ManagerReview -> FinalDecision
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, fair_seq)
root_fair.order.add_edge(fair_seq, final_decision)
```

In this **fair** model, there is no XOR that differentially routes applicants based on community affiliation; all candidates undergo the same `CulturalFitCheck` and `ManagerialReview` sequence.
