## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics Using Process Mining

**Reconstructing and Analyzing Actual Job Flows**

Process mining leverages MES event logs to reveal the real, as-executed process flows and task sequences on each resource. By transforming the logs into structured event sequences (traces) for each job, we can:

- Visually reconstruct each job’s route through the factory, mapping every step, queue entry, setup, task start/end, and disruption event.
- Unfold machine-centric “resource logs” to see exactly which jobs, in what sequence, were processed on each machine, with pauses, setups, and breakdowns.

**Key Techniques and Metrics**

- *Process Discovery*: Use tools like the Directly-Follows Graph (DFG) and Petri nets to map actual job flows, routing variants, and identify frequent vs. rare paths.
- *Performance Analysis*: Overlay the discovered models with performance data.
    - **Job Flow and Lead Times**: For each job, calculate time from release to completion (flow time), and aggregate across jobs for distribution analysis.
    - **Makespan Distributions**: For larger batches or production windows, compute makespan (latest finish minus earliest start) and track its variability[2][4].
    - **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times)**: For each task, subtract queue entry from setup start or task start to quantify waiting at each machine.
    - **Resource Utilization**: For each machine/operator, segment time into productive (processing), setup, idle (no job), waiting for maintenance, and downtime (breakdown) blocks. Calculate % utilization as productive + setup time divided by total available time.
    - **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**: Mine all “Setup Start/End” pairs, link to both preceding and succeeding jobs, and statistically profile setup durations as a function of job sequence (e.g., via heatmaps or matrix plots showing average setup time from job A to B).
    - **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**: For each completed job, subtract due date from actual completion. Aggregate for mean/median/percentile tardiness, lateness rates, and identify jobs with largest delays (worst-case analysis)[5].
    - **Impact of Disruptions**: Tag log segments with breakdown or “hot job” events. Analyze KPIs (waiting times, queue lengths, WIP, tardiness) before, during, and after such disruptions to quantify their impact.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies with Process Mining

**Key Pathologies and Quantitative Evidence**

- **Bottleneck Identification**: Analyze machine-centric event logs for consistently high queue lengths, above-average task durations, and waiting times. Calculate each machine’s utilization and time-in-queue statistics. Machines with sustained high utilization and long queues are bottlenecks, limiting throughput[2][4].
- **Delayed High-Priority Jobs**: Use variant analysis to compare routing/timing of on-time vs. late or urgent jobs. Identify cases where high-priority/hot jobs are delayed due to long waits in queues behind lower priority work, evidencing ineffective prioritization.
- **Suboptimal Sequencing (Setup Overhead)**: Cross-reference setup time data with job sequences. Identify periods where frequent switching between job types caused total setup time to spike, versus times when similar jobs were batched and setup times minimized.
- **Starvation of Downstream Resources**: Inspect event logs for idle periods at downstream workstations coinciding with bottlenecks or blockages upstream, demonstrating that poor scheduling or bottleneck overload leads to downstream starvation.
- **Bullwhip Effect in WIP**: Track WIP levels between workstations over time; plot spikes and analyze their correlation with schedule variability, breakdowns, or hot job insertions. Evidence strong variability and lack of flow control.

Process mining tools enable automated generation of these insights via:
- *Bottleneck analysis* (e.g., via resource-centric performance overlays)
- *Variant analysis* (comparing paths and outcomes for different job categories)
- *Resource contention heatmaps* (highlighting periods of high/low machine load and queue buildup)
- *Case attribute correlation* (e.g., relating setup times to job sequence patterns)

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Common root causes likely to emerge for Precision Parts Inc.:

- **Static Dispatching Rule Limitations**: Simple heuristics (FCFS, EDD) do not dynamically account for bottlenecks, setup overhead, machine availability, or job priorities. When job mix, disruptions, or machine-specific constraints change, these rules become suboptimal.
- **Lack of Real-Time Shop Floor Visibility**: Without instant awareness of actual queue lengths, machine status, or in-progress work, local scheduling decisions frequently conflict or fail to exploit available capacity.
- **Setup/Duration Estimation Errors**: If planning ignores historical distributions of task/setup times (especially under sequence-dependence), schedules will be unrealistic, leading to lateness and poor resource allocation.
- **Ineffective Sequence-Dependency Handling**: Not accounting for setup times driven by job order leads to excessive changeovers and lost productive time.
- **Poor Coordination Across Work Centers**: Siloed scheduling can lead to upstream overproduction (excess WIP), downstream starvation, and poor end-to-end flow.
- **Inadequate Disruption Response**: Lacking predictive maintenance or dynamic rescheduling for breakdowns/hot jobs causes cascading delays.

**Process mining distinguishes between scheduling logic failures vs. capacity/process constraints:**
- If process mining reveals that even theoretically optimal job sequences still overload certain resources, the issue may be true capacity bottlenecks.
- If variant analysis shows that alternative routing/sequencing (as occasionally happens) yields better performance, current scheduling logic is at fault.

## 4. Developing Advanced, Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Criteria Dispatching Rules (Data-Driven Priority Index)**

**Core Logic:**
- Replace simplistic FCFS/EDD with a composite priority index for each job at each decision point. The index dynamically weighs factors:
    - Remaining processing time (shortest remaining processing time first)
    - Proximity to due date
    - Customer/job priority (e.g., “hot job” flag)
    - Downstream bottleneck queue length or load
    - *Estimated sequence-dependent setup time* if this job is run next, based on mined historical setups for that machine/job-pair

**Use of Process Mining:**
- Historical data used to train or calibrate the weighting of each factor (e.g., how much does setup time typically impact KPIs?).
- Sequence-dependent setup time estimator based on mined averages for each job-pair transition at each machine.
- Real-time process visibility via MES enables up-to-date queue/prioritization.

**Addresses:**
- Reduces excessive setup time, improves adherence to due dates, prevents resource starvation, and balances priorities.

**Expected Impact:**
- Lower mean tardiness, smoother resource utilization, reduced WIP and setup overhead.

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Realistic Task/Setup Distributions and Disruption Anticipation**

**Core Logic:**
- Use process mining to obtain empirical distributions (not point estimates) for task and setup durations, differentiated by job type, machine, operator, and sequence context.
- Schedule generation leverages stochastic models, simulates the expected duration and uncertainty for each task.
- If predictive maintenance indicators (e.g., mean time between failures derived from log “Breakdown Start” events) are available, proactively schedule preventive maintenance or add risk buffers on critical machines.
- Hot job impact is modeled by inserting urgent jobs into simulation to estimate knock-on delays.

**Use of Process Mining:**
- Task/setup duration models built from event logs (e.g., kernel density estimation, machine learning regression).
- Disruption frequencies and mean durations captured for simulation and risk-aware planning.

**Addresses:**
- Narrows gap between planned and actual performance, enables earlier detection of likely delays, supports more accurate customer lead time estimates, and provides tools for what-if scenario planning.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduced tardiness, improved schedule reliability, better customer communication.

### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Minimization via Intelligent Sequencing and Batching**

**Core Logic:**
- Apply process mining to discover patterns of high setup times due to unfavorable sequencing; construct a setup time “transition matrix” for each machine.
- At scheduling time, optimize the sequence of jobs to minimize total expected setup time (e.g., via Traveling Salesman Problem algorithms or metaheuristics), particularly for bottleneck and high-setup machines.
- Where feasible, batch jobs with similar setup profiles together (even if from different customers), and negotiate order acceptance or due date flexibility to allow for more efficient grouping.

**Use of Process Mining:**
- Quantifies expected setup overhead for all possible job transitions per machine.
- Identifies job attributes (e.g., material, geometry) that drive high setup times for clustering.

**Addresses:**
- Cuts non-productive time, increases throughput on constraint machines, reduces WIP by smoothing flow.

**Expected Impact:**
- Substantial improvements in total throughput (makespan), machine utilization, and lower lead times.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Discrete-Event Simulation for Strategy Evaluation**

- Parameterize a digital twin of the shop floor with empirical task and setup time distributions, routing probabilities, breakdown/maintenance frequencies, and disruption patterns obtained from process mining.
- Simulate current (baseline) and proposed schedules under realistic conditions:
    - High overall load, queueing dynamics
    - Burst of hot jobs or urgent priorities
    - Resource breakdowns (volatility scenarios)
    - Setup-heavy job mixes

**KPIs to Track:**
- Mean/variance of tardiness
- WIP levels at each stage
- Lead time predictability
- Machine utilization (by state)
- Frequency and duration of starvation and blockage events

**Continuous Improvement Framework**

- Deploy ongoing process mining to the live event stream from the MES.
- Automatically update key models:
    - Resource utilization, task/setup time distributions, disruption frequencies
    - Priority index weighting retrained periodically based on outcome tracking (reinforcement learning)
- Monitor KPI trends over time; detect drifts (e.g., rising setup times, new bottlenecks) using statistical process control techniques.
- Trigger alerts for manual or automated rescheduling logic adjustment when systematic inefficiencies or deviations emerge.
