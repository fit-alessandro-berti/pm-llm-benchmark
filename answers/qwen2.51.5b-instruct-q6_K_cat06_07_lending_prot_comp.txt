From a typical consumer protection perspective, we should look for any process variants that violate normal business practices or create unnecessary barriers to entry for customers. Based on the provided data:

### Unfair Differences Between Protected and Unprotected Groups

1. **First-Visit Verification**:
   - **Protected Group**: Includes multiple requests (Set Appointment -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan, etc.) which is common in the credit application process.
   - **Unprotected Group**: The only significant difference here is that there are no explicit visits required for verification before submitting a file or initiating additional steps like requesting co-signers or making further assessments.

2. **Performance of Process Variants**:
   - Some processes seem to be more efficient with the Protected Group compared to the Unprotected Group.
     - For example, verifying borrowers' information and then submitting it directly leads to higher performance for Protected Group (e.g., Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied).
   - Conversely, unprotected groups have more steps that are less efficient or may involve additional visits without clear benefits.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **Protected Group**: Several processes (like Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter) show high performance but may not be the most common procedure.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Some unprotected group variations involve longer or less efficient steps, especially those involving multiple visits that don't add substantial value.

### Potential Unfairness:
1. **Redundant Steps**:
   - The Protected Group has a significant number of steps (e.g., verifying information before submitting), while the Unprotected Group typically skips this step, which could be seen as unnecessary for the consumer.

2. **Risk Incentives**:
   - If these processes are not standardized or require additional visits without clear benefits to the customer, it can create an unfair advantage for those in protected status who have access to more detailed information from the start.
   
3. **Customer Experience**:
   - The Protected Group's steps seem to offer a more streamlined and potentially safer process because they allow for clearer verification upfront.

4. **Efficiency**: 
   - Unprotected group steps that require multiple visits or additional checks (like skipped examinations, making multiple visits) might be seen as less efficient or riskier for the consumer compared to protected groups where verification is completed before significant steps like requesting a co-signer are initiated.

### Recommendations:
- Ensure consistency in all process variants across both groups.
- Highlight redundant steps and potentially unnecessary customer interactions that could lead to increased risk or inefficiency.
- Consider standardizing the most effective (and safest) path for all consumers, including those in protected groups, to reduce unfair advantages and risks.
