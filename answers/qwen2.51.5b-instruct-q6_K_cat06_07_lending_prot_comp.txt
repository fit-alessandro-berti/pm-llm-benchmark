Based on the provided data, here are some primary observations and differences:

1. **Request Appointment Phase:**
   - The number of times the request appointment step is attempted for a single user has ranged from 4 to 9.
   - Many users skip this step altogether.

2. **Hand In Credit Application Step:**
   - Generally, there's no distinct frequency in how many applications are handed in by each user, indicating that it varies widely based on individual behavior patterns.

3. **Verification of Borrowers Information Step:**
   - Both "Verify Borrower Details" and "Skipped Examination" steps occur quite frequently for the same users.
   - Users tend to skip examinations more than they verify borrower details, but most do both.

4. **Making Visit to Assess Collateral and Requesting a Co-Signer On Loan Steps:**
   - These steps are requested individually or together within the context of "Verify Borrower Details."
   - For verification, these steps are requested multiple times independently.
   - The order in which users request these items can vary widely; it does not particularly follow a standard logical sequence as per usual loan scenarios.

5. **Handling Loan Processing Steps:**
   - There is significant inconsistency with the number of visits needed prior to signing the loan agreement:
     - Some users go straight through without a visit, while many need more than one.
     - The total number in preparation (handing files over or signing docs) varies widely from user to user.

6. **Loan Denial Process:**
   - While not directly related data on the above steps being skipped indicates that loan applications are indeed getting down-serviced:
     - Users get denied on a regular basis, which is consistent with financial services operations.
  
**Overall Conclusions:**

The primary difference lies in how users interact and navigate each phase of the loan application process. Some behaviors persistently skew more towards skipping tasks rather than fulfilling them completely. Additionally, there's considerable variability in whether users proceed to additional steps like making visits or requesting co-signers. The overall success rates (performance) are relatively consistent across many attempts due to repeated requests leading up to the final step (loan signing).

If you're dealing with a loan approval process for financial institutions, this data indicates that managing and understanding these user interactions is crucial but often results in variations in customer experience based on their individual behaviors.
