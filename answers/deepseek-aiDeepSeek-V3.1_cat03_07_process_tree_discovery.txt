Based on the observed event log, the process tree should capture the following behavior:
1. The process starts with "Receive Application (RA)".
2. Then, there is a sequence of "Validate Form (VF)" and "Assess Eligibility (AE)".
3. After that, there might be a loop (which can occur multiple times) where "Request Missing Info (RMI)" is followed by "Validate Form (VF)" and "Assess Eligibility (AE)" again.
4. Then, "Approval Decision (AD)" is performed.
5. Finally, "Send Confirmation (SC)" and "Archive Case (AC)" are executed in sequence.

The process tree is:

```
-> (
    'RA',
    -> (
        'VF',
        'AE',
        * (
            tau,
            -> (
                'RMI',
                -> (
                    'VF',
                    'AE'
                )
            )
        ),
        'AD',
        -> (
            'SC',
            'AC'
        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**
- The entire process is a sequence (->) starting with 'RA'.
- Then, there is a sequence of 'VF' and 'AE'.
- After that, there is a loop (*) that:
  - Can be skipped (tau) to exit.
  - Or can execute a sequence of 'RMI', followed by 'VF' and 'AE' (which then leads back to the loop).
- After the loop, there is 'AD'.
- Finally, there is a sequence of 'SC' and 'AC'.

This model captures:
- The mandatory initial activity 'RA'.
- The mandatory 'VF' and 'AE' after 'RA'.
- The optional and repeating pattern of 'RMI' followed by 'VF' and 'AE' (which can occur multiple times, as seen in case 3).
- The mandatory 'AD' after the loop.
- The mandatory sequence 'SC' and 'AC' at the end.

The loop is structured with a tau (silent transition) to allow exiting without doing the loop, and the body of the loop is a sequence of 'RMI', then 'VF' and 'AE'. This ensures that after each 'RMI', the form is validated and eligibility is assessed again.
