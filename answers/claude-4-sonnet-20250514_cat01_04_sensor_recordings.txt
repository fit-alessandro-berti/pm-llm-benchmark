## Process Mining Analysis of Manufacturing Assembly Line

After analyzing the sensor data patterns, I've identified **5 distinct manufacturing activities** based on the characteristic signatures in temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption.

### Identified Activities and Event Groupings:

#### **Activity 1: Machine Idle/Standby** 
**Events: 1-3, 13-15**
- **Temperature**: 20-21°C (ambient)
- **Pressure**: 1 bar (atmospheric)
- **Vibration**: 0 Hz (no movement)
- **Material Flow**: 0 units/s (no processing)
- **Tool Position**: 0 mm (home position)
- **Energy**: 0.40-0.50 kWh (minimal baseline consumption)

**Rationale**: These readings represent the machine in standby mode with minimal energy consumption, no mechanical activity, and all sensors at baseline levels.

#### **Activity 2: Cutting Metal**
**Events: 4-6**
- **Temperature**: 50-58°C (rising heat from cutting)
- **Pressure**: 1-1.5 bar (moderate cutting force)
- **Vibration**: 30-38 Hz (high cutting vibrations)
- **Material Flow**: 5 units/s (steady material processing)
- **Tool Position**: 5-10 mm (progressive cutting depth)
- **Energy**: 2.00-3.00 kWh (high power for cutting operation)

**Rationale**: The combination of rising temperature, significant vibration, steady material flow, and progressive tool movement strongly indicates a metal cutting operation. The energy consumption peaks during this phase.

#### **Activity 3: Assembling Parts**
**Events: 7-8**
- **Temperature**: 40°C (moderate, cooling from cutting)
- **Pressure**: 2 bar (assembly pressure)
- **Vibration**: 10 Hz (low, controlled movement)
- **Material Flow**: 2 units/s (reduced flow for positioning)
- **Tool Position**: 15 mm (fixed assembly position)
- **Energy**: 2.00 kWh (moderate consumption)

**Rationale**: Stable readings with moderate pressure suggest parts are being positioned and assembled. The fixed tool position and reduced material flow indicate precise placement operations.

#### **Activity 4: Welding**
**Events: 9**
- **Temperature**: 80°C (high heat from welding)
- **Pressure**: 2 bar (welding pressure)
- **Vibration**: 50 Hz (intense welding vibrations)
- **Material Flow**: 0 units/s (no material movement during welding)
- **Tool Position**: 15 mm (fixed welding position)
- **Energy**: 5.00 kWh (peak energy consumption)

**Rationale**: The highest temperature and energy consumption, combined with intense vibration and zero material flow, clearly indicates a welding operation. This is the most energy-intensive process in the sequence.

#### **Activity 5: Quality Inspection**
**Events: 10-12**
- **Temperature**: 30-25°C (cooling down)
- **Pressure**: 1 bar (minimal pressure)
- **Vibration**: 1-5 Hz (gentle inspection movements)
- **Material Flow**: 0-1 units/s (minimal or no flow)
- **Tool Position**: 15-20 mm (inspection positioning)
- **Energy**: 1.00-1.60 kWh (low consumption)

**Rationale**: Gradual cooling, minimal vibration, and low energy consumption suggest inspection activities. The slight tool movement indicates scanning or measurement operations for quality control.

### **Process Flow Summary:**
The identified process follows a logical manufacturing sequence:
1. **Idle**  2. **Cutting Metal**  3. **Assembling Parts**  4. **Welding**  5. **Quality Inspection**  6. **Return to Idle**

This represents a complete manufacturing cycle where raw material is cut, assembled into components, welded together, inspected for quality, and the machine returns to standby for the next cycle.
