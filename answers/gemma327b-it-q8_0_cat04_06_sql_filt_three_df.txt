**Explanation:**

1. **`SequenceCases` CTE:** This CTE identifies `case_id`s that contain at least one instance of 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. This is a preliminary step to filter for cases that *could* contain the full sequence.

2. **`CreateOrderCases` CTE:** This CTE filters for `case_id`s that contain 'Create Order' *immediately* after 'Approve Purchase Requisition' within the same case.  The `LAG` function is used to check the preceding activity.

3. **`ConfirmOrderCases` CTE:** This CTE filters for `case_id`s that contain 'Confirm Order' *immediately* after 'Create Order' within the same case.  Again, `LAG` is used to verify the sequence.

4. **`TimingCases` CTE:** This CTE identifies `case_id`s where the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is greater than 5 days.  It joins the `event_log` table to itself to find the timestamps of these two events within the same case and calculates the difference in days using `strftime('%J', timestamp)`.

5. **Final `SELECT` Statement:** This statement selects all columns from the `event_log` table, but filters out events where the `case_id` is present in the `TimingCases` CTE. This ensures that only events from cases that *do not* meet both the sequence and timing criteria are returned.

**Key improvements and considerations:**

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is broken down into CTEs, making it easier to understand each step of the process.
* **Correctness:** The use of `LAG` function correctly identifies the sequence of activities. The timing condition is accurately implemented using `strftime('%J', timestamp)` to calculate the difference in days.
* **Efficiency:** Using CTEs can help the DuckDB query optimizer to execute the query more efficiently.
* **Handles Multiple Occurrences:** The query correctly handles cases where the sequence appears multiple times within the same `case_id`.  If *any* instance of the sequence meets the timing criteria, the entire case is excluded.
* **DuckDB Specifics:** The query uses DuckDB-specific functions like `LAG` and `strftime`.
* **Error Handling:**  This query assumes the data is clean and that the necessary columns exist.  In a production environment, you might want to add error handling to handle missing data or invalid timestamps.
* **Alternative Timing Calculation:**  While `strftime('%J', timestamp)` is a simple way to calculate the difference in days, it doesn't account for time of day.  For more precise timing calculations, you could use `JULIANDAY(timestamp)` and subtract the values.  However, `strftime` is generally sufficient for this problem.
