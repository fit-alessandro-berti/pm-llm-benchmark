From the event log provided, it appears that there are several potential performance issues that could be affecting the process. Here are some root causes based on the data:

1. High frequency of certain events: Some events, such as "pick item", "confirm order", and "pay order", have a high frequency of occurrence. This could indicate that these tasks are taking a long time to complete, leading to bottlenecks in the process.
2. Long duration of certain events: Some events, such as "create package", "send package", and "package delivered", have long durations. This could be due to inefficiencies in the process, such as waiting times or manual tasks that could be automated.
3. High number of objects involved in certain events: Some events, such as "pick item", "confirm order", and "pay order", involve a high number of objects. This could indicate that these tasks are resource-intensive, requiring significant computing power or storage capacity.
4. Dependencies between events: The events are closely dependent on each other, which could create bottlenecks and delays in the process. For example, the "pick item" event is often followed by the "confirm order" event, which in turn is often followed by the "pay order" event. If any of these events take a long time to complete, it could slow down the entire process.
5. Imbalance in workload: The event log shows that some employees are involved in more events than others. This could indicate an imbalance in the workload, with some employees being overworked while others have too little to do.
6. Lack of automation: Many of the events in the log involve manual tasks, such as picking items or confirming orders. This could indicate a lack of automation in the process, which could lead to inefficiencies and delays.

To address these performance issues, consider the following potential solutions:

1. Optimize tasks with high frequency: Analyze the tasks with high frequency and duration to identify any inefficiencies or bottlenecks that could be addressed through process improvements, automation, or resource allocation.
2. Reduce the number of objects involved in events: Consider ways to reduce the number of objects involved in events, such as by implementing batch processing or batching tasks together.
3. Address dependencies between events: Review the dependencies between events to identify any bottlenecks or delays that could be addressed through process redesign or workflow optimization.
4. Balance workload: Ensure that the workload is balanced among employees to prevent overwork and underutilization of resources.
5. Automate manual tasks: Identify manual tasks that could be automated to improve efficiency and reduce the workload on employees.
6. Monitor and improve performance: Continuously monitor performance metrics, such as event duration and frequency, to identify trends and opportunities for improvement.
