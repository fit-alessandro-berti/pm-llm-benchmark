Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the process flow and the rules given in Part 1, then check each case in the event log against those rules. Then, move on to the desiderata in Part 2 and see where those are violated. Let me start by breaking down the normative constraints.

The strict sequence is: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  If Approved: Finalize Documentation  Close Case. So each case must follow this exact order, with no skipping or reversing. Also, specific ordering rules: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk before Loan Decision, Inform after Loan Decision. For approved loans, Finalize Documentation before Close Case. For rejected, no Finalize Documentation.

Now, looking at the event log for each case:

Case 1:
- All steps in order. Application, Credit Check, Risk, Decision (Approved), Inform, Finalize, Close. Seems compliant with all normative rules. No obvious issues here.

Case 2:
- Application Received, then Risk Assessment without a prior Credit Check. That's a violation of the ordering rule (Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment). Then Credit Check happens later. Then Loan Decision (Rejected), followed by Finalize Documentation. But since it's rejected, Finalize Documentation shouldn't be there. So two violations: order of Risk Assessment and Credit Check, and Finalize after rejection.

Case 3:
- Application Received, then Credit Check happens more than 24 hours later (on 1/14 vs 1/12). That's a desideratum violation (timeliness). Then Risk Assessment, Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant after 48 hours (from 1/14 12:00 to 1/16 15:00 is 2 days 3 hours, which is over 48 hours? Wait, 1/14 12:00 to 1/16 12:00 is 48 hours, then 3 more hours. So yes, Inform Applicant is late. Also, no Follow-up Call. So these are desiderata issues but not normative violations. Also, Finalize Documentation and Close Case in order. So Case 3 doesn't violate normative rules, just the recommended timings and follow-up.

So for part 1, violations are in Case 2. For part 2, Case 3 has desiderata issues.

Now, possible justifications: For Case 2, maybe they thought Risk Assessment could be done first, but the rules are strict. Or maybe a system error. For Case 3, delays could be due to workload or other factors, but the desiderata are not strictly enforced.

Wait, let me double-check Case 3's timings. Application Received on 1/12 09:00, Credit Check on 1/14 10:00. That's 2 days and 1 hour later. So more than 24 hours, which violates the desideratum. Then the Inform Applicant is on 1/16 15:00. The Loan Decision was on 1/14 12:00. So from Decision to Inform is 2 days 3 hours. The recommendation is 48 hours (2 days), so this is 3 hours over. So that's another desideratum. Also no Follow-up Call.

Case 2's Risk Assessment before Credit Check is a clear normative violation. Also, Finalize Documentation after rejection is another.

So the answer should list these points. Also, suggest possible interpretations, like maybe the team in Case 2 made a mistake, or in Case 3, delays were unavoidable.

### **1. Violations of Normative Rules**  
**Case 2** violates multiple strict rules:  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**: The process starts with **Risk Assessment** (2024-01-11 08:20) *before* performing a **Credit Check** (2024-01-11 09:00), violating the required sequence.  
- **Finalize Documentation after Loan Rejection**: After a **Loan Decision (Rejected)** (2024-01-11 09:30), **Finalize Documentation** (2024-01-11 10:00) is incorrectly performed, which is explicitly prohibited for rejected applications.  
- **Incomplete Closure**: While **Close Case** (2024-01-11 10:30) is executed, the process should have skipped **Finalize Documentation** entirely for a rejected loan.  

**Case 1** and **Case 3** comply fully with all normative constraints.  

---

### **2. Violations of Desiderata (Recommended Best Practices)**  
**Case 3** fails to meet the following desiderata:  
- **Delayed Credit Check**: The **Credit Check** (2024-01-14 10:00) occurs **>24 hours** after **Application Received** (2024-01-12 09:00), violating the recommendation to complete it within 24 hours.  
- **Delayed Notification to Applicant**: **Inform Applicant** (2024-01-16 15:00) occurs **>48 hours** after **Loan Decision (Approved)** (2024-01-14 12:00), breaching the prompt notification guideline.  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**: No **Follow-up Call** is recorded before **Close Case** (2024-01-17 10:00), though this is only a recommended step.  

**Case 1** and **Case 2** (despite normative violations) adhere to the timing desiderata, though this is irrelevant for Case 2 due to its strict rule violations.

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**  
- **Case 2**:  
  - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**: This could stem from a misunderstanding of the workflow (e.g., assuming Risk Assessment is a preliminary step) or system errors (e.g., misconfigured automation). However, this is a critical violation of the normative process.  
  - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**: Likely a human error (e.g., staff oversight) or a failure to enforce conditional logic in the system. This undermines the integrity of the decision-making process.  

- **Case 3**:  
  - **Delayed Credit Check and Notification**: Delays may reflect resource constraints (e.g., understaffed teams) or external dependencies (e.g., third-party credit checks). While suboptimal, these are non-critical and could be addressed through process optimization.  
  - **Missing Follow-up Call**: The absence of a follow-up might indicate low prioritization of this step, as it is not mandatory. However, it risks reducing customer satisfaction or alignment.  

---

### **Summary**  
- **Strict Violations (Case 2)**:  
  - Incorrect order of **Risk Assessment** and **Credit Check**.  
  - **Finalize Documentation** performed after loan rejection.  
- **Desiderata Violations (Case 3)**:  
  - Delays in **Credit Check** and **Inform Applicant**.  
  - Missing **Follow-up Call**.  

**Recommendations**:  
- Enforce strict validation checks in the process (e.g., automated blockers to prevent out-of-order activities).  
- Provide training to address misunderstandings (e.g., Case 2).  
- Optimize resource allocation to reduce delays (e.g., Case 3).  
- Consider making **Follow-up Call** mandatory if it significantly improves outcomes.
