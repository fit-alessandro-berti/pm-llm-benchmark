<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a DuckDB SQL query that filters out certain cases from the event log based on specific sequence and timing conditions. Let me break down what needs to be done.

First, I need to identify cases that have the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' followed by 'Confirm Order' with no other events in between. Then, among those, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Finally, exclude all events from these cases and return the rest.

Hmm, how to approach the sequence detection? Maybe using window functions to order events within each case. For each case, I can assign a row number based on the timestamp. Then, for each event, check if the next two events in sequence are the ones we need.

Wait, but how to ensure that there are no other events in between. So, for a case to have the exact sequence of three activities in order, each subsequent activity must be immediately after. So for the first activity (Approve), the next activity in the same case must be Create Order, and then the next after that must be Confirm Order. And there should be exactly three events in that sequence with no gaps.

So maybe I need to self-join the event_log table for the same case_id, where each subsequent event has a higher row number. Let me think.

Let me outline steps:

1. For each case, order the events by timestamp. Assign a row number to each event in the case's order.

2. For each event in the case, check if the next event (row number +1) has activity 'Create Order' and the one after that (row number +2) has 'Confirm Order'. Also, ensure that the timestamps are in order (though ordering by timestamp is already done via row numbers, assuming no two events have same timestamp, but maybe better to check).

Once I find such sequences, I need to note the case_ids. Then, among those, calculate the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. If that's more than 5 days, include those case_ids in the exclusion list.

Finally, select all events not in those excluded cases.

But how to implement this in SQL?

Let me try to structure this.

First, create a CTE that adds row numbers per case, ordered by timestamp. Let's call it ordered_events.

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        activity, 
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)

Then, find cases where there exists a row where:

- activity is 'Approve...', and the next row (rn+1) has 'Create Order', and the next row (rn+2) has 'Confirm Order'.

So, we can self-join ordered_events three times? Or use correlations?

Alternatively, for each case, check if there exists a sequence. Maybe using exists or joins.

Another approach is to join the ordered_events table with itself for the same case_id, where the second row is rn = first_rn + 1, third row is first_rn + 2, and the activities match.

So:

SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
FROM ordered_events o1
JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
  AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'

This would get all case_ids that have the exact sequence of three consecutive activities. Let's call this CTE as sequences.

Now, for each of these cases, we need to calculate the time between 'Create Order' (o2.timestamp) and 'Confirm Order' (o3.timestamp). The condition is that this difference is more than 5 days.

So in the same CTE or another CTE, we can compute that. Then select case_ids where JULIANDAY(o3.timestamp) - JULIANDAY(o2.timestamp) > 5. But DuckDB uses different date functions. Wait, DuckDB's timestamp handling: to calculate the difference in days, perhaps using (o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp) / 86400 (seconds in a day) ?

Alternatively, using DATE_DIFF function. For example, DATE_DIFF('day', o2.timestamp, o3.timestamp) > 5. Wait, but DATE_DIFF in DuckDB is the number of boundaries crossed. So if the timestamps are datetime, need to check if the difference is more than 5 days. Maybe using the difference in seconds divided by 86400, but need to ensure that it's strictly more than 5*86400 seconds.

But perhaps the exact function depends on DuckDB's capabilities. Let me check.

In DuckDB, to compute the difference between two timestamps in days, you can subtract them to get an interval, but extracting days might be tricky. Alternatively, using the EXTRACT function. Or converting to EPOCH and calculating.

For example:

EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0 > 5

But DuckDB's date arithmetic: if you subtract two TIMESTAMPs, you get an INTERVAL. Then, you can cast that to seconds, or use EXTRACT(EPOCH ...).

So perhaps:

SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp2 - timestamp1)) / 86400.0 AS days_diff

So, in our case, we need:

EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0 > 5

Once we have those case_ids, we need to exclude them from the final result.

Putting it all together:

First, find all case_ids that have the sequence and meet the time condition.

Then, select all events from event_log where case_id is not in that list.

So the overall query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT s.case_id
    FROM (
        -- Find cases with the sequence
        SELECT o1.case_id
        FROM ordered_events o1
        JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
        JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
        WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
          AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
          AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    ) s
    -- Now check the time between o2 and o3 (Create and Confirm)
    JOIN ordered_events o2_sub ON s.case_id = o2_sub.case_id AND o2_sub.rn = s.o1_rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3_sub ON s.case_id = o3_sub.case_id AND o3_sub.rn = s.o1_rn + 2
    WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (o3_sub.timestamp - o2_sub.timestamp)) / 86400.0 > 5
)

Wait, but in the subquery s, we only have case_id. How to get the o2 and o3 timestamps? Because in the initial join to find the sequence, we have the case_id, but not the rn of o1. Wait, in the first part, the inner query that finds the case_ids with the sequence, perhaps we need to also capture the rn of o1, so that we can later get o2 and o3 for that specific sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps in the same query where we find the case_ids, we can compute the time difference.

Wait, in the initial joins (o1, o2, o3), we already have o2 and o3's timestamps. So maybe the time difference can be calculated directly in that same query. Let me adjust:

So the subquery that finds the case_ids with the sequence and the time condition can be:

SELECT o1.case_id
FROM ordered_events o1
JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
  AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0) > 5

So this gives the case_ids that have the sequence and the time condition. Therefore, the outer query can exclude these case_ids.

Therefore, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
    WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0) > 5
)

But wait, the ordered_events is a CTE. So putting it all together:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        activity, 
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
    WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0) > 5
)

But need to make sure that the subquery returns unique case_ids, hence the DISTINCT.

But what if a case has multiple such sequences? For example, the same case has the sequence occurring more than once. But using DISTINCT ensures that each case is considered once.

Now, let me check for possible errors. For example, the ordered_events CTE is inside the WITH, which is correct.

But in DuckDB, the EXTRACT function syntax: EXTRACT ( unit FROM timestamp ). So EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp) ?

Wait, in DuckDB, subtracting two timestamps gives an interval. So o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp is an interval. Then, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM interval) gives the total seconds. So dividing by 86400 gives days. So yes, that should work.

Another thing: what if there are multiple sequences in a case? For example, a case has the sequence once, but meets the time condition. It will be excluded. Even if there are other sequences in the same case that don't meet the time condition, but once one sequence meets both criteria, the case is excluded.

That's correct according to the problem statement.

Now, what about cases that have the sequence but the time between Create and Confirm is <=5 days? Those are not excluded. So our subquery correctly selects only those cases where both conditions are met.

Now, the outer query returns all events not in those excluded cases.

This seems correct.

But let me test for possible edge cases. For example, a case that has the three activities in order but with another event in between. The ordered_events rn would have o1.rn, then rn+1 is Create Order, but if there's another event between them, then the rn+1 would not be Create Order, so it's not selected. So the initial joins correctly enforce that there are no events in between.

Another edge case: if a case has the three activities in order, but the time between Create and Confirm is exactly 5 days. Then it's not excluded. Correct.

What if the timestamps are in the same day but the actual difference is more than 5 days? Well, the calculation is based on the actual difference in seconds, not calendar days, which is correct.

So the query should work.

Now, putting it all together in DuckDB SQL.

But need to make sure that the ordered_events is defined in the CTE. Also, note that the main query is selecting from event_log, which is the original table.

Another thing to consider: if a case has multiple sequences, but only some of them meet the time condition. But as long as at least one sequence meets both criteria, the case is excluded.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, writing the full query.

Also, need to make sure that the subquery is correctly correlated. Also, in DuckDB, the NOT IN clause should work with the subquery.

But sometimes, using NOT IN with subqueries that might have NULLs can be problematic, but assuming that case_id is not NULL, it's okay.

So the final query would be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        activity, 
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 
        ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 
        ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
    WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0) > 5
)

But perhaps the EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...) can be simplified. Alternatively, using the - operator between timestamps and casting to BIGINT as epoch seconds.

Alternatively, in DuckDB, you can cast timestamps to BIGINT which represents the EPOCH time. So:

CAST(o3.timestamp AS BIGINT) - CAST(o2.timestamp AS BIGINT) as seconds_diff

Then divide by 86400.0.

But I need to check if DuckDB allows that. Let me think. DuckDB's TIMESTAMP can be cast to BIGINT as the number of microseconds since epoch? Or seconds?

Actually, DuckDB's TIMESTAMP is stored as microseconds since epoch. So casting to BIGINT would give microseconds. Therefore, to get seconds, divide by 1e6. Alternatively, perhaps using the EPOCH function. Wait, DuckDB has a function EPOCH() which returns the number of seconds since epoch. So perhaps:

EPOCH(o3.timestamp) - EPOCH(o2.timestamp) as seconds_diff

Which would give the difference in seconds. Then dividing by 86400.0 gives days. That might be more efficient.

So changing the condition to:

AND (EPOCH(o3.timestamp) - EPOCH(o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0 > 5

That would be better.

So the revised subquery:

...
        AND (EPOCH(o3.timestamp) - EPOCH(o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0 > 5

This would be better and perhaps more readable.

So the final query becomes:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        activity, 
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 
        ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 
        ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
    WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (EPOCH(o3.timestamp) - EPOCH(o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0 > 5
)

This should work.

Now, check if the ordered_events CTE is correctly referenced. Yes, because o1, o2, o3 are all from ordered_events.

Another thing to note: what if there are multiple cases that meet the criteria? The NOT IN will exclude them all.

Now, what about cases that have the sequence but with more than three activities? For example, a case that has the three activities in order but also other activities. The initial joins check for the sequence, regardless of other activities in the case. Which is correct.

Also, the problem says that the three events must appear in exact order with no other events from the same case in between. The row_number ensures that o2 is immediately after o1, and o3 immediately after o2, so there are no events in between. So that's correctly handled.

Therefore, this query should meet all the requirements.
</think>

To address the problem of filtering out events from process instances that follow a specific sequence and timing condition, we can use a combination of window functions and joins in DuckDB. The final SQL query is structured to:

1. Identify the exact sequence of three activities in consecutive order.
2. Ensure the time between the second and third activity is greater than 5 days.
3. Exclude all events from cases that meet these conditions.

###  Final DuckDB SQL Query

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        activity, 
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 
        ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 
        ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
    WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (EPOCH(o3.timestamp) - EPOCH(o2.timestamp)) / 86400.0 > 5
)
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

###  Explanation

#### **1. CTE: `ordered_events`**
- Adds a row number (`rn`) to each event within a `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`.
- This ensures that events are processed in chronological order per case.

#### **2. Subquery to Identify Matching Cases**
- Joins `ordered_events` three times to find sequences where:
  - The first event is `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`
  - The second is `'Create Order'`
  - The third is `'Confirm Order'`
- Ensures the sequence is in **direct succession** (no gaps) using `rn + 1` and `rn + 2`.
- Calculates the time difference between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` using `EPOCH()` to get seconds, then converts to days.
- Filters for cases where this time is **more than 5 days**.

#### **3. Final Selection**
- Selects all events from the original `event_log` table **excluding** those from cases identified in the subquery.
- Orders the result by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity.

---

###  Edge Case Considerations
- **Multiple matching sequences in a single case**: Only one sequence is needed to exclude the case.
- **Time calculation precision**: Uses actual elapsed seconds to compute the time difference between events.
- **No other events in between**: The `rn + 1` and `rn + 2` logic ensures this.

---

This query efficiently and accurately filters out the specified cases based on sequence and timing, returning the rest of the event log as required.
