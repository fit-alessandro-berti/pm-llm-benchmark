## Detailed Analysis

### Case 1:  No Violations
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This is a textbook execution of the **sufficient inventory** path. Every activity occurs in the prescribed order, and "Close order" is the final step. No issues.

### Case 2:  Violation — Packaging before Payment Authorization
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items  Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment." The normative description is explicit that *"Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging"* and *"Package items should only occur after authorization."* Here, items were packaged at 10:00 and payment was authorized at 10:30, reversing the required order.

**Rationale:** Authorizing payment before packaging ensures the customer's payment is valid before resources are spent preparing the shipment. Packaging items without confirmed payment creates risk and contradicts the intended process logic.

### Case 3:  Multiple Violations — Shipping after Cancellation (and other issues)
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order  Ship order**  Close order

**Violation 1 (most severe): "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."** The normative description states unambiguously: *"Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."* It further notes that *"once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)."* Shipping a cancelled order is a direct contradiction of the process rules.

**Violation 2: "Ship order" occurs without "Package items."** Even setting aside the cancellation, the order was shipped without ever being packaged. The description requires that *"items must be prepared before they can be shipped"* — i.e., "Ship order" should only follow "Package items."

**Violation 3 (interpretive): "Authorize payment" occurs in what becomes a cancellation path.** The normative description states that when inventory is insufficient, the process should go *directly* from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order." Authorizing payment before cancelling suggests either an error in the process flow or that inventory was initially deemed sufficient but the order was cancelled for another reason. Regardless, authorizing payment and then cancelling (rather than proceeding to packaging) deviates from both described paths.

### Case 4:  No Violations
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This is a textbook execution of the **insufficient inventory** (cancellation) path. The order is received, inventory is checked and found lacking, the order is cancelled, and finally closed. No issues.

---

### Case 5:  Violation — Shipping without Packaging
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violation: "Ship order" occurs without "Package items."** The normative description states that *"Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped"* and *"Ship order should only occur after packaging."* The "Package items" activity is entirely missing from this case. The order jumps directly from payment authorization to shipping, skipping a mandatory step.

**Rationale:** The packaging step is not optional in the fulfillment path — it is a required prerequisite for shipping. Items must be physically prepared before dispatch, and omitting this step violates the prescribed sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Package**  Ship  Close.
