from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define all activity transitions
SR = Transition(label="Service Request")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Step 2: Create the parallel execution block for DA and ACI
# These two can be done concurrently (no order between them)
parallel_prep = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
# No edges added, so they are concurrent

# Step 3: Create the loop for configuration phase
# Loop structure: BNC is the "do" part, D&R is the "redo" part
# Loop executes BNC, then either exits or executes D&R and goes back to BNC
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 4: Create the exclusive choice for deployment method
# Either CD or MD, but not both
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 5: Create the partial order for QA and SA
# Both must complete before GLA, but can be done in any order or concurrently
final_checks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
# No edges between QA and SA, so they are concurrent

# Step 6: Build the overall process as a strict partial order
# The main flow: SR -> CS -> parallel_prep -> loop_config -> xor_deployment -> final_checks -> GLA
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, parallel_prep, loop_config, xor_deployment, final_checks, GLA])

# Step 7: Define the ordering constraints
# SR must complete before CS
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# CS must complete before the parallel preparation phase
root.order.add_edge(CS, parallel_prep)

# Both DA and ACI (in parallel_prep) must complete before the loop configuration
root.order.add_edge(parallel_prep, loop_config)

# Loop configuration must complete before the deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, xor_deployment)

# Deployment must complete before final checks
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, final_checks)

# Final checks (QA and SA) must both complete before GLA
root.order.add_edge(final_checks, GLA)

# The root now represents the complete POWL model for the digital service provisioning process
print("POWL model constructed successfully!")
print(f"Root model: {root}")

**Explanation of the model structure:**

1. **Sequential start**: `SR  CS` ensures the service request is verified before contract setup.

2. **Parallel preparation**: `parallel_prep` contains `DA` and `ACI` with no ordering between them, allowing concurrent execution.

3. **Looped configuration**: `loop_config = *(BNC, D&R)` models the iterative configuration process where BNC is executed, then either the loop exits (configuration stable) or D&R is executed followed by another iteration of BNC.

4. **Exclusive deployment choice**: `xor_deployment = X(CD, MD)` represents the choice between containerized or monolithic deployment.

5. **Concurrent final checks**: `final_checks` contains `QA` and `SA` with no ordering, allowing them to run concurrently or in any order.

6. **Final approval**: `GLA` can only execute after both QA and SA complete.

The overall partial order ensures the proper sequence: verification  contract  parallel prep  configuration loop  deployment choice  final checks  approval.
