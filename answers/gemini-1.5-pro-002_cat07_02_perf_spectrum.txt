The visualization appears to be an alluvial diagram showing the progression of events related to fines over time.  

* **Three stages/events:** The horizontal lines represent different stages in a process: "Send Fine," "Insert Fine Notification," and "Send for Credit Collection."
* **Time axis:** The bottom axis represents time, spanning from January 25, 2000, to April 24, 2013.
* **Flows:** The gray and reddish lines connecting the stages represent the flow or transition of instances (presumably fines) through the process.  A gray line indicates a direct transition between stages at approximately the same time. Reddish lines indicate transitions occurring over longer periods. The thickness of a line likely suggests the volume of instances following that particular path.
* **Patterns:**
    * The majority of "Send Fine" events seem to quickly transition to "Insert Fine Notification," indicated by the numerous, mostly vertical gray lines.
    * There is a clear time lag between "Insert Fine Notification" and "Send for Credit Collection," as shown by the angled, reddish lines. This suggests that a significant portion of fines are not immediately sent for collection.
    * There are a few cases where fines seemingly go directly from "Send Fine" to "Send for Credit Collection" (some thin, angled red lines).  These are a smaller fraction than those going through the "Insert Fine Notification" stage.
    * The visualization allows us to see the distribution of the durations between these events.


In summary, the visualization tracks the lifecycle of fines, demonstrating the time it takes for them to progress through different stages of handling.  It highlights the delays between notification and collection, providing insights into the efficiency of the fine collection process.
