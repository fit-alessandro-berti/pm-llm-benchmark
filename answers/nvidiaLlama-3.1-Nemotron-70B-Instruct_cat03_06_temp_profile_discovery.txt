Generating a temporal profile from the provided process variants involves calculating the average (AVG) and standard deviation (STDEV) of the times between each pair of activities across all occurrences in the traces. However, the provided data includes:

1. **Process Variants (Traces):** Sequences of activities.
2. **Frequency of Each Variant:** The number of times each variant occurs.
3. **Performance (Total Time) of Each Variant:** The total time taken by each variant, but not the individual times between activities.

Since the individual times between activities within each trace are not provided, we cannot directly calculate the AVG and STDEV for each pair of activities as required for the temporal profile. The average and standard deviation calculations for the temporal profile would typically follow these steps for each pair of activities:

1. **Collect Time Intervals:** Gather all time intervals between each occurrence of the activity pair across all traces.
2. **Calculate Average (AVG):** Sum all time intervals and divide by the number of intervals.
3. **Calculate Standard Deviation (STDEV):** Use the AVG and individual intervals to compute the standard deviation.

Given the limitations of the provided data, we'll outline a conceptual approach to generate a temporal profile if we had the necessary detailed timing information for each activity pair. We'll then provide a mock example based on hypothetical timing data for illustrative purposes.

### Conceptual Approach (if detailed timing data were available):

1. **Extract Activity Pairs:** From each trace, identify all unique pairs of activities (e.g., (A, B), (A, C), (B, C), etc.), considering both direct and indirect follow-ups.
2. **Collect Time Intervals for Each Pair:**
   - For each pair, gather all the time intervals from the start of the first activity to the start of the second activity across all occurrences.
3. **Calculate AVG and STDEV for Each Pair:**
   - Use the collected intervals to calculate the average (AVG) and standard deviation (STDEV) for each activity pair.

### Mock Example with Hypothetical Timing Data:

Assume we have detailed timing data and have extracted the following intervals for a few activity pairs:

| **Activity Pair** | **Time Intervals (Seconds)** |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| (Create Fine, Send Fine) | 10, 12, 15, 10, 11      |
| (Send Fine, Insert Fine Notification) | 20, 22, 18, 25        |
| (Insert Fine Notification, Add penalty) | 5, 6, 4, 7, 5        |

**Calculations for Temporal Profile (Simplified for Illustration):**

- **(Create Fine, Send Fine)**
  - **AVG:** `(10 + 12 + 15 + 10 + 11) / 5 = 11.6` seconds
  - **STDEV:** Assuming a simple standard deviation calculation for illustration (actual calculation would involve more steps), let's say it's approximately `2.1` seconds.

- **(Send Fine, Insert Fine Notification)**
  - **AVG:** `(20 + 22 + 18 + 25) / 4 = 21.25` seconds
  - **STDEV:** Approximately `2.5` seconds.

- **(Insert Fine Notification, Add penalty)**
  - **AVG:** `(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 + 5) / 5 = 5.4` seconds
  - **STDEV:** Approximately `1.1` seconds.

### Example Temporal Profile (Python Dictionary):

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (11.6, 2.1),
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (21.25, 2.5),
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): (5.4, 1.1)
    #... Add more pairs as calculated
}
```

### Note:
- The actual calculation of standard deviation involves more steps, including finding the variance.
- This example assumes a simplistic dataset for illustrative purposes. Real-world datasets would be more complex and might require more sophisticated analysis tools or programming libraries (e.g., Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy/SciPy for statistical calculations in Python). 
- Given the original data's nature, to accurately generate a temporal profile, you would need the specific timing information for each activity transition, which is not provided in your question.
