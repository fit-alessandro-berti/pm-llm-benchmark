To analyze which cases have significantly longer total resolution times compared to others, we first need to calculate the duration between each ticket's receipt and its closure.

Let’s break down the calculation for each case:

### Case 101:
- **Received:** 2024-03-01 08:00
- **Closed:** 2024-03-01 10:15
- Total time: 2 hours and 15 minutes

### Case 102:
- **Received:** 2024-03-01 08:05
- **Closed:** 2024-03-02 09:15 (Next day)
- Total time: ~25 hours and 10 minutes

### Case 103:
- **Received:** 2024-03-01 08:10
- **Closed:** 2024-03-01 09:30 (Same day)
- Total time: ~1 hour and 20 minutes

### Case 104:
- **Received:** 2024-03-01 08:20
- **Closed:** 2024-03-02 08:30 (Next day)
- Total time: ~24 hours and 10 minutes

### Case 105:
- **Received:** 2024-03-01 08:25
- **Closed:** 2024-03-03 09:30 (Next next day)
- Total time: ~47 hours and 6 minutes

From this breakdown, we can identify that Case 102 and Case 104 have significantly longer resolution times than the others. However, Case 105 stands out as the most problematic with a total duration of nearly two days.

### Potential Root Causes:
1. **Escalation to Level-2 Agent:**
   - Cases 102, 104, and 105 all required escalation to a Level-2 agent at some point.
   - Escalations often lead to delays as they require more specialized knowledge, which may not be immediately available.

2. **Long Waiting Times Between Activities:**
   - Particularly evident in Case 102 and Case 104 where there are significant gaps between activities (e.g., from Level-1 assignment to escalation).
   - For instance:
     - In Case 102, the time gap between “Assign to Level-1 Agent” at 09:00 on Day 1 and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" at 11:30 on Day 1 is substantial.
     - Similarly, in Case 104, there’s a significant delay from assignment (at 09:30) to investigation (at 13:00).

### Recommendations:
1. **Enhance Escalation Process:**
   - Establish clear criteria for when and how escalations should occur.
   - Implement better communication channels or tools that allow quicker routing of escalated tickets to Level-2 agents.

2. **Optimize Workflow Timing:**
   - Ensure there is a consistent follow-up mechanism in place to minimize delays between assigning the ticket to an agent and starting the investigation process.
   - Set benchmarks for response times at each stage, ensuring that no single step drags out unnecessarily.

3. **Staffing Considerations:**
   - Review staffing levels, particularly during peak hours or known periods of high escalation frequency, to ensure there are enough Level-2 agents available.
   - Cross-training Level-1 agents on handling more complex issues could also reduce the need for frequent escalations.

By addressing these factors, we can aim to streamline the resolution process and reduce overall cycle times.
