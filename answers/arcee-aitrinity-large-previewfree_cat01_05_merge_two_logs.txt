Looking over both logs, the first step is to line up the events by order ID and timing. Log A is considered the main timeline, but its timestamps reflect when the system received the event, not necessarily when it actually started. Log B has more detail—extra attributes like user and resource IDs, plus descriptive notes—but its timestamps can be slightly ahead or behind Log A's.

To match events, I set a tolerance window: if two events for the same order are within about 2 seconds of each other, they're likely the same occurrence. Event names don't always match perfectly, so I rely more on timing and context.

Starting with the first event, Log A's "Order Received" at 10:00:00Z lines up closely with Log B's "OrderReceived" at 09:59:58Z—just 2 seconds apart—so I merge them, keeping the Log A timestamp as the main one and pulling in Log B's extra details (user_id, resource_id, notes).

Next, "Order Validated" in Log A (10:01:30Z) is nearly identical to "OrderValidation" in Log B (10:01:29Z)—a 1-second difference—so those merge too, again favoring Log A's timestamp but including Log B's attributes.

For "Payment Processed" (10:02:00Z) and "PaymentCheck" (10:02:05Z), the 5-second gap is a bit more than ideal, but the sequence and order context make it clear these are the same step. I merge them, using Log A's timestamp and adding Log B's details.

Log A then has "Item Shipped" at 10:05:00Z, which aligns closely with Log B's "Shipping" at 10:05:02Z (2 seconds apart). These merge, with Log A's timestamp as primary.

Log A's "Item Delivered" at 10:20:00Z has no corresponding event in Log B, so it stays as-is.

Log B has a "Quality Check" at 10:03:00Z, which doesn't appear in Log A at all, so that's included separately, with Log B's timestamp and all its attributes.

Putting it all together chronologically, the merged log is:

1. **2023-10-10T10:00:00Z** - Order Received, Order#1234, user_id: u45, resource_id: r10, notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"
2. **2023-10-10T10:01:30Z** - Order Validated, Order#1234, user_id: u12, resource_id: r10, notes: "Cross-check inventory"
3. **2023-10-10T10:02:00Z** - Payment Processed, Order#1234, user_id: u12, resource_id: r99, notes: "Payment gateway delay"
4. **2023-10-10T10:03:00Z** - Quality Check, Order#1234, user_id: u45, resource_id: r11, notes: "Random inspection"
5. **2023-10-10T10:05:00Z** - Item Shipped, Order#1234, user_id: u45, resource_id: r10, notes: "Package handed to courier"
6. **2023-10-10T10:20:00Z** - Item Delivered, Order#1234

This approach keeps the main timeline intact, integrates all available details, and transparently documents how each event was handled.
