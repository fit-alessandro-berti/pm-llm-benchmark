### **Merged Event Log with Reasoning**

Below is the merged event log, combining events from **Log A** and **Log B** where possible, while preserving unmatched events. The final log is ordered chronologically based on the **primary timestamp (Log A's timestamp)** unless otherwise noted.

### **Final Merged Log**
*(Format: `primary_timestamp, event_type, order_id, [additional attributes from Log B], source_logs`)*

| **Timestamp (Primary)** | **Event Type**       | **Order ID** | **User ID** | **Resource ID** | **Notes**                          | **Source Logs** |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z   | Order Received       | Order#1234   | u45         | r10             | "Event captured at warehouse system" | Log B only      |
| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z   | Order Received       | Order#1234   | -           | -               | -                                  | Log A only      |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z   | Order Validated       | Order#1234   | u12         | r10             | "Cross-check inventory"            | Log A + Log B   |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z   | Payment Processed     | Order#1234   | u12         | r99             | "Payment gateway delay"            | Log A + Log B   |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z   | Quality Check         | Order#1234   | u45         | r11             | "Random inspection"                | Log B only      |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z   | Item Shipped          | Order#1234   | u45         | r10             | "Package handed to courier"        | Log A + Log B   |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z   | Item Delivered        | Order#1234   | -           | -               | -                                  | Log A only      |

### **Reasoning for Merging Decisions**

1. **Order Received (Log A vs. Log B)**
   - **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, Order Received, Order#1234`
   - **Log B:** `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, OrderReceived, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"`
   - **Decision:** These are **not merged** because:
     - The timestamps differ by **2 seconds**, which is within tolerance, but:
     - Log A's timestamp likely reflects when the event was **received**, not when it **started**.
     - Log B's timestamp is **earlier**, suggesting it was recorded at the source (warehouse).
     - Since Log A is the "primary" timeline, we keep both events but mark them as separate.

2. **Order Validated (Log A) vs. OrderValidation (Log B)**
   - **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, Order Validated, Order#1234`
   - **Log B:** `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, OrderValidation, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"`
   - **Decision:** **Merged** because:
     - Timestamps differ by **1 second** (within tolerance).
     - Event names are semantically equivalent (`Order Validated` vs. `OrderValidation`).
     - Combined attributes from both logs.

3. **Payment Processed (Log A) vs. PaymentCheck (Log B)**
   - **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234`
   - **Log B:** `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"`
   - **Decision:** **Merged** because:
     - Timestamps differ by **5 seconds** (slightly beyond tolerance, but likely the same event).
     - Event names are related (`Payment Processed` vs. `PaymentCheck`).
     - Log B's notes explain a delay, which aligns with Log A's timestamp.

4. **Quality Check (Log B only)**
   - **Log B:** `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"`
   - **Decision:** **Kept as-is** because:
     - No corresponding event in Log A.
     - Unique to Log B.

5. **Item Shipped (Log A) vs. Shipping (Log B)**
   - **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234`
   - **Log B:** `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, Shipping, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"`
   - **Decision:** **Merged** because:
     - Timestamps differ by **2 seconds** (within tolerance).
     - Event names are equivalent (`Item Shipped` vs. `Shipping`).

6. **Item Delivered (Log A only)**
   - **Log A:** `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234`
   - **Decision:** **Kept as-is** because:
     - No corresponding event in Log B.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Timestamp Tolerance:** Used **2 seconds** as a threshold for matching.
- **Event Naming:** Matched events with similar semantics (e.g., `Order Validated`  `OrderValidation`).
- **Attribute Integration:** Combined all available attributes when merging.
- **Unmatched Events:** Preserved events that appeared in only one log.

This approach ensures a **rich, unified timeline** while maintaining clarity on event origins.
