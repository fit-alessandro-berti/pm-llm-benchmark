### Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors in the Event Log

1. **Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
   - **Case 1002:** The activity "Confirm Shipment" occurs before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock," which deviates from the normal process flow.
   - **Case 1003:** The activity "Ship Goods" occurs before "Confirm Shipment," which is out of sequence.
   - **Case 1004:** The activity "Receive Payment" occurs before "Issue Invoice," which is unusual.

2. **Missing Activities:**
   - **Case 1003:** The activity "Validate Stock" is missing, which is a critical step in the normal process flow.
   - **Case 1004:** The activities "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock" are missing.

3. **Late Confirmations:**
   - **Case 1003:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity has an additional_info field indicating "late_confirmation=Y," suggesting a delay in this step.

4. **Early Confirmations:**
   - **Case 1002:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity has an additional_info field indicating "attempted_early=Y," suggesting an attempt to confirm shipment prematurely.

5. **Unusual Payment Timing:**
   - **Case 1004:** The "Receive Payment" activity occurs almost immediately after "Register Order," which is unusual and could indicate a prepayment or a system error.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
   - **System Errors:** There might be a bug in the system that allows activities to be logged out of sequence.
   - **Policy Violations:** Employees might be bypassing standard procedures due to time pressures or lack of training.

2. **Missing Activities:**
   - **System Errors:** The system might fail to log certain activities due to a bug.
   - **Policy Violations:** Employees might be skipping steps to expedite the process.

3. **Late Confirmations:**
   - **Resource Constraints:** There might be a shortage of staff or resources in the Logistics department, causing delays.
   - **System Delays:** The system might be slow to update the status of shipments.

4. **Early Confirmations:**
   - **Policy Violations:** Employees might be trying to meet KPIs by confirming shipments prematurely.
   - **System Errors:** The system might allow confirmations before the necessary checks are completed.

5. **Unusual Payment Timing:**
   - **System Errors:** There might be a bug causing payments to be logged incorrectly.
   - **Policy Violations:** Customers might be making prepayments, which should be flagged for review.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Investigation

1. **Identify Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
   ```sql
   WITH normal_sequence AS (
       SELECT activity, ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS seq
       FROM (VALUES 
           ('Register Order'),
           ('Perform Credit Check'),
           ('Validate Stock'),
           ('Confirm Shipment'),
           ('Ship Goods'),
           ('Issue Invoice'),
           ('Receive Payment')
       ) AS normal_activities(activity)
   ),
   event_sequence AS (
       SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
              ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
       FROM order_event_log
   )
   SELECT es.case_id, es.activity, es.timestamp, ns.seq AS normal_seq, es.seq AS actual_seq
   FROM event_sequence es
   JOIN normal_sequence ns ON es.activity = ns.activity
   WHERE es.seq != ns.seq
   ORDER BY es.case_id, es.timestamp;
   ```

2. **Identify Missing Activities:**
   ```sql
   WITH normal_activities AS (
       SELECT activity
       FROM (VALUES 
           ('Register Order'),
           ('Perform Credit Check'),
           ('Validate Stock'),
           ('Confirm Shipment'),
           ('Ship Goods'),
           ('Issue Invoice'),
           ('Receive Payment')
       ) AS normal_activities(activity)
   ),
   case_activities AS (
       SELECT DISTINCT case_id, activity
       FROM order_event_log
   )
   SELECT ca.case_id, na.activity
   FROM normal_activities na
   CROSS JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) ca
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM case_activities
       WHERE case_activities.case_id = ca.case_id
       AND case_activities.activity = na.activity
   )
   ORDER BY ca.case_id, na.activity;
   ```

3. **Investigate Late Confirmations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, additional_info
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
   AND additional_info LIKE '%late_confirmation=Y%'
   ORDER BY timestamp;
   ```

4. **Investigate Early Confirmations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, additional_info
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
   AND additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early=Y%'
   ORDER BY timestamp;
   ```

5. **Investigate Unusual Payment Timing:**
   ```sql
   WITH payment_timing AS (
       SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
              LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
              LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp
       FROM order_event_log
   )
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, prev_activity, prev_timestamp
   FROM payment_timing
   WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
   AND prev_activity != 'Issue Invoice'
   ORDER BY timestamp;
   ```

These queries will help identify and investigate the anomalies in the event log, providing insights into potential system errors, policy violations, or resource constraints.
