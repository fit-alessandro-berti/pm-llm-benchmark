So I've got this task to create a temporal profile for a supply chain process in manufacturing high-tech electronics. The process involves a series of activities: Supplier Selection (SS), Order Placement (OP), Receive Components (RC), Quality Inspection (QI), Component Assembly (CA), Product Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Warehouse Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), and After-Sales Support (AS). I need to estimate the average time and standard deviation between pairs of these activities that eventually follow each other in the process executions.

First, I need to understand what "eventually follow each other" means. From the prompt, it seems that for a trace like <A,B,C,D>, we consider pairs like (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), and (C,D). So, it's not just the directly consecutive activities but also those that are further apart in the sequence.

Given that, for the supply chain process, the activities are likely to follow a specific order, but there might be variations or parallel paths in some executions. However, since the problem doesn't specify any parallel activities or alternative paths, I'll assume a linear sequence for simplicity: SS → OP → RC → QI → CA → PT → PK → WS → DT → AS.

But wait, in reality, supply chain processes can have parallel activities, like ordering from multiple suppliers or assembling different components simultaneously. However, since the prompt doesn't provide details on such complexities, I'll stick to a linear sequence to keep things manageable.

Now, I need to estimate the average time and standard deviation for each pair of activities that eventually follow each other. That means for every pair (A, B) where A comes before B in the sequence, not necessarily directly.

For example, (SS, OP), (SS, RC), (SS, QI), ..., (SS, AS), then (OP, RC), (OP, QI), ..., (OP, AS), and so on, up to (DT, AS).

That's a lot of pairs! But the prompt says to include a representative subset, so I don't need to list all possible pairs, just enough to show the pattern and cover different distances between activities.

Let me think about how to estimate the times. Since no explicit numerical data is provided, I need to make reasonable assumptions based on typical supply chain timelines.

Let's start by estimating the time between consecutive activities.

SS to OP: Supplier Selection to Order Placement. Once a supplier is selected, placing an order might take a few days to a week, depending on negotiations and paperwork. Let's say average 3 days, with a standard deviation of 1 day.
Wait, but I need to express times in seconds, as per the example in the prompt.

There are 86400 seconds in a day. So, 3 days is 3 * 86400 = 259200 seconds. Standard deviation of 1 day is 86400 seconds.

But maybe it's better to think in terms of hours or days and then convert to seconds.

Alternatively, since the example uses seconds, I'll keep it in seconds.

Actually, for supply chain processes, times can range from hours to weeks, so seconds might be too granular, but I'll stick to the requirement.

Wait, the example has ('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600), which is 1 day and 1 hour. So, it's fine.

Let me proceed.

OP to RC: Order Placement to Receive Components. This depends on the supplier's lead time, which can vary widely. For electronics components, it might be a few weeks to a couple of months. Let's assume an average of 30 days, with a standard deviation of 7 days.
So, 30 * 86400 = 2592000 seconds, std dev 7 * 86400 = 604800 seconds.

RC to QI: Receive Components to Quality Inspection. Once components are received, inspection might start immediately or after a short delay. Let's say average 1 day, std dev 0.5 days.
So, 86400 seconds, std dev 43200 seconds.

QI to CA: Quality Inspection to Component Assembly. If components pass inspection, assembly can start soon after. Maybe a few hours to a day. Let's say average 12 hours, std dev 6 hours.
12 hours = 43200 seconds, std dev 21600 seconds.

Wait, actually, 12 hours is 12 * 3600 = 43200 seconds, yes.

CA to PT: Component Assembly to Product Testing. After assembly, testing might be done immediately or after some preparation. Let's say average 1 day, std dev 0.5 days.
86400 seconds, std dev 43200 seconds.

PT to PK: Product Testing to Packaging. If the product passes testing, packaging can follow quickly. Maybe a few hours. Average 6 hours, std dev 3 hours.
6 * 3600 = 21600 seconds, std dev 10800 seconds.

PK to WS: Packaging to Warehouse Storage. Once packaged, moving to warehouse storage might take a short time, say a few hours. Average 4 hours, std dev 2 hours.
4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds, std dev 7200 seconds.

WS to DT: Warehouse Storage to Distribution. The time in storage can vary greatly depending on demand and logistics. It could be days to weeks. Let's assume average 14 days, std dev 7 days.
14 * 86400 = 1209600 seconds, std dev 604800 seconds.

DT to AS: Distribution to After-Sales Support. After-sales support starts after the product is delivered and might be triggered by customer issues, which can happen anytime after delivery. This is tricky to estimate. Perhaps it's better to consider the time from distribution to when support is typically needed, but since support can be ongoing, maybe it's not directly comparable. For simplicity, let's assume an average of 90 days, std dev 30 days.
90 * 86400 = 7776000 seconds, std dev 2592000 seconds.

Wait, but actually, after-sales support might not be a direct follow-up in the same way as the other activities. It might be better to consider it as a separate process. However, since the prompt includes it in the list, I'll keep it.

Now, these are the times for consecutive activities. But I also need to consider pairs that are not directly consecutive, like (SS, RC), (SS, QI), etc.

For these, the time between A and C, where B is between them, would be the sum of the times from A to B and B to C, but since the times are random variables, the average would be the sum of the averages, and the standard deviation would be the square root of the sum of the variances, assuming independence.

Wait, more precisely, if X and Y are independent random variables, then Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y), so std dev is sqrt(Var(X) + Var(Y)).

So, for example, for (SS, RC), which goes through OP, the average time would be average(SS to OP) + average(OP to RC), and the std dev would be sqrt( std dev(SS to OP)^2 + std dev(OP to RC)^2 ).

Similarly for other pairs.

But actually, in a sequence, the time from A to C is the sum of the times from A to B and B to C only if B is always between A and C, which in a linear sequence it is.

However, if there are parallel paths or alternative routes, it might be different, but since I'm assuming a linear sequence, this should hold.

Wait, actually, even in a linear sequence, the time from A to C is not simply the sum of A to B and B to C, because the process might have waiting times or other activities in between. But in this model, since we're considering the time between activities that eventually follow each other, and the trace is a sequence of activities, I think it's reasonable to assume that the time from A to C is the sum of the times between consecutive activities along the path from A to C.

For example, in the trace <SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS>, the time from SS to RC would be the time from SS to OP plus the time from OP to RC.

Assuming that the times between consecutive activities are independent, then yes, the average time from SS to RC is avg(SS to OP) + avg(OP to RC), and the std dev is sqrt( std dev(SS to OP)^2 + std dev(OP to RC)^2 ).

Similarly for other pairs.

So, to generalize, for two activities A and B with k activities in between, the average time is the sum of the averages of the k+1 consecutive pairs, and the std dev is the square root of the sum of the variances of those k+1 pairs.

Wait, actually, for A to B with activities C1, C2, ..., Ck in between, the time is the sum of times from A to C1, C1 to C2, ..., Ck to B, so it's the sum of k+1 inter-activity times.

Yes.

Therefore, I can calculate the average and std dev for any pair by summing the averages and combining the variances accordingly.

But to do this, I first need to define the times for all consecutive pairs.

Wait, earlier I started defining times for consecutive pairs, but I only did a few.

Actually, in the list above, I have:

SS to OP: avg 3 days, std dev 1 day
OP to RC: avg 30 days, std dev 7 days
RC to QI: avg 1 day, std dev 0.5 days
QI to CA: avg 0.5 days (12 hours), std dev 0.25 days (6 hours)
Wait, earlier I said 12 hours, which is 0.5 days, and std dev 6 hours, which is 0.25 days.

But to be consistent, maybe I should use days and then convert to seconds at the end.

Alternatively, since the final output needs to be in seconds, I can work in seconds from the start.

Let me define the times for all consecutive pairs.

Let's list the activities in order:

SS
OP
RC
QI
CA
PT
PK
WS
DT
AS
So, the consecutive pairs are:

(SS, OP), (OP, RC), (RC, QI), (QI, CA), (CA, PT), (PT, PK), (PK, WS), (WS, DT), (DT, AS)

I need to estimate avg and std dev for each of these.

Earlier, I had:

(SS, OP): 3 days, std dev 1 day
(OP, RC): 30 days, std dev 7 days
(RC, QI): 1 day, std dev 0.5 days
(QI, CA): 0.5 days, std dev 0.25 days
Wait, actually, 12 hours is 0.5 days, yes.

Then,

(CA, PT): let's say 1 day, std dev 0.5 days
(PT, PK): 0.25 days (6 hours), std dev 0.125 days (3 hours)
(PK, WS): 0.1667 days (4 hours), std dev 0.0833 days (2 hours)
(WS, DT): 14 days, std dev 7 days
(DT, AS): 90 days, std dev 30 days
Wait, but for (DT, AS), as I thought earlier, it might not be directly comparable, but I'll keep it for now.

Now, to convert to seconds, I can multiply the days by 86400.

But perhaps it's easier to keep them in days for calculation and convert at the end.

Wait, actually, since I need to sum them for non-consecutive pairs, and then convert to seconds, I can calculate in days and then convert.

But for the std dev, since it's the square root of the sum of variances, and variance is (std dev)^2, I need to be careful with the units.

Actually, since time is in seconds, and std dev is also in seconds, I should probably work in seconds from the start to avoid confusion.

Let me define the times in seconds.

First, let's set the averages and std devs for consecutive pairs:

(SS, OP): avg = 3 * 86400 = 259200 seconds, std dev = 1 * 86400 = 86400 seconds
(OP, RC): avg = 30 * 86400 = 2592000 seconds, std dev = 7 * 86400 = 604800 seconds
(RC, QI): avg = 1 * 86400 = 86400 seconds, std dev = 0.5 * 86400 = 43200 seconds
(QI, CA): avg = 0.5 * 86400 = 43200 seconds, std dev = 0.25 * 86400 = 21600 seconds
Wait, 0.5 days is 43200 seconds, yes, since 0.5 * 86400 = 43200.

Similarly, 0.25 days is 21600 seconds.

Then,

(CA, PT): avg = 1 * 86400 = 86400 seconds, std dev = 0.5 * 86400 = 43200 seconds
(PT, PK): avg = 0.25 * 86400 = 21600 seconds, std dev = 0.125 * 86400 = 10800 seconds
Wait, 0.25 days is 21600 seconds, but actually, 0.25 days is 6 hours, and 6 * 3600 = 21600 seconds, yes.

Similarly, 0.125 days is 3 hours, 3 * 3600 = 10800 seconds.

(PK, WS): avg = (4/24) * 86400 = (1/6) * 86400 = 14400 seconds, std dev = (2/24) * 86400 = (1/12) * 86400 = 7200 seconds
Since 4 hours is 4/24 days, etc.

(WS, DT): avg = 14 * 86400 = 1209600 seconds, std dev = 7 * 86400 = 604800 seconds
(DT, AS): avg = 90 * 86400 = 7776000 seconds, std dev = 30 * 86400 = 2592000 seconds
Alright, now, for non-consecutive pairs, say (SS, RC), which has OP in between, the average time is avg(SS to OP) + avg(OP to RC) = 259200 + 2592000 = 2851200 seconds

The variance is var(SS to OP) + var(OP to RC) = (86400)^2 + (604800)^2

Then std dev = sqrt( (86400)^2 + (604800)^2 )

Let me calculate that.

First, 86400^2 = 7464960000

604800^2 = 365783040000

Sum = 7464960000 + 365783040000 = 373248000000

Then std dev = sqrt(373248000000) ≈ 611000 seconds (since 611000^2 = 373321000000, close enough)

Similarly, for (SS, QI), which has OP and RC in between, but actually, since it's a linear sequence, the time from SS to QI is the sum of SS to OP, OP to RC, and RC to QI.

So avg = 259200 + 2592000 + 86400 = 2937600 seconds

Variance = (86400)^2 + (604800)^2 + (43200)^2

Calculate each: 86400^2 = 7464960000

604800^2 = 365783040000

43200^2 = 1866240000

Sum = 7464960000 + 365783040000 + 1866240000 = 375115680000

Std dev = sqrt(375115680000) ≈ 612500 seconds

And so on.

But now, to create the dictionary, I need to include a representative subset of these pairs.

Since there are many possible pairs, I'll select some that are directly consecutive, some that are a few steps apart, and some that are further apart.

For example:

Directly consecutive: (SS, OP), (OP, RC), (RC, QI), etc.
A few steps apart: (SS, RC), (OP, QI), (QI, PT), etc.
Further apart: (SS, PT), (OP, WS), (CA, DT), etc.
Also, include some pairs involving AS, like (SS, AS), (DT, AS).

Let me choose, say, 10 pairs to include in the dictionary.

First, let's include all consecutive pairs, since they are the building blocks.

Wait, there are 9 consecutive pairs: (SS, OP), (OP, RC), (RC, QI), (QI, CA), (CA, PT), (PT, PK), (PK, WS), (WS, DT), (DT, AS)

But the prompt says "a representative subset", so maybe I don't need all of them.

Alternatively, since the task is to show complexity by considering pairs separated by multiple steps, perhaps I should include some non-consecutive pairs.

Let me include a mix.

For instance:

(SS, OP)
(OP, RC)
(RC, QI)
(SS, RC) # which is SS to OP to RC
(SS, QI) # SS to OP to RC to QI
(QI, PT) # QI to CA to PT
(CA, WS) # CA to PT to PK to WS
(WS, AS) # WS to DT to AS
(SS, AS) # the entire process
(DT, AS)
Wait, (DT, AS) is already a consecutive pair.

Maybe include (PT, DT), which is PT to PK to WS to DT.

Alright, let's calculate for these pairs.

First, for consecutive pairs:

('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 86400)
('OP', 'RC'): (2592000, 604800)
('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200)
('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 21600)
('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200)
('PT', 'PK'): (21600, 10800)
('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 7200)
('WS', 'DT'): (1209600, 604800)
('DT', 'AS'): (7776000, 2592000)
But since I need a subset, let's pick a few of these and some non-consecutive ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the task expects me to include all possible pairs, but that would be too many.

Wait, in the prompt, it says "for each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other)", but then it says "include a representative subset".

So, I think including some examples is sufficient.

Let me calculate for the following pairs:

('SS', 'OP')
('OP', 'RC')
('SS', 'RC')
('SS', 'QI')
('QI', 'PT')
('CA', 'WS')
('WS', 'AS')
('SS', 'AS')
First, ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 86400)

Second, ('OP', 'RC'): (2592000, 604800)

Third, ('SS', 'RC'): as calculated earlier, avg = 259200 + 2592000 = 2851200, std dev ≈ 611000

Wait, more precisely, std dev = sqrt(86400^2 + 604800^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 365783040000) = sqrt(373248000000) = 610938.5 ≈ 610900 seconds

Similarly, ('SS', 'QI'): avg = 259200 + 2592000 + 86400 = 2937600, std dev = sqrt(86400^2 + 604800^2 + 43200^2) = sqrt(7464960000 + 365783040000 + 1866240000) = sqrt(375115680000) = 612465.5 ≈ 612500 seconds

Next, ('QI', 'PT'): this involves QI to CA to PT, so avg = avg(QI to CA) + avg(CA to PT) = 43200 + 86400 = 129600 seconds, std dev = sqrt(21600^2 + 43200^2) = sqrt(466560000 + 1866240000) = sqrt(2332800000) = 48300 seconds

Wait, more precisely, 21600^2 = 466560000, 43200^2 = 1866240000, sum = 2332800000, sqrt(2332800000) ≈ 48299.4 ≈ 48300 seconds

Then, ('CA', 'WS'): this involves CA to PT to PK to WS, so avg = avg(CA to PT) + avg(PT to PK) + avg(PK to WS) = 86400 + 21600 + 14400 = 122400 seconds, std dev = sqrt(43200^2 + 10800^2 + 7200^2) = sqrt(1866240000 + 116640000 + 51840000) = sqrt(2034720000) ≈ 45107.9 ≈ 45100 seconds

Next, ('WS', 'AS'): this involves WS to DT to AS, so avg = avg(WS to DT) + avg(DT to AS) = 1209600 + 7776000 = 8985600 seconds, std dev = sqrt(604800^2 + 2592000^2) = sqrt(365783040000 + 6718464000000) = sqrt(7084247040000) ≈ 2661690 seconds

Finally, ('SS', 'AS'): this is the entire process, sum of all consecutive averages: 259200 + 2592000 + 86400 + 43200 + 86400 + 21600 + 14400 + 1209600 + 7776000 = let's calculate step by step.

First, SS to OP: 259200

OP to RC: 2592000

RC to QI: 86400

QI to CA: 43200

CA to PT: 86400

PT to PK: 21600

PK to WS: 14400

WS to DT: 1209600

DT to AS: 7776000

Sum: 259200 + 2592000 = 2851200

2851200 + 86400 = 2937600

2937600 + 43200 = 2980800

2980800 + 86400 = 3067200

3067200 + 21600 = 3088800

3088800 + 14400 = 3103200

3103200 + 1209600 = 4312800

4312800 + 7776000 = 12088800 seconds

So, avg = 12088800 seconds

For std dev, it's sqrt( sum of variances of all consecutive pairs)

Variances: 86400^2, 604800^2, 43200^2, 21600^2, 43200^2, 10800^2, 7200^2, 604800^2, 2592000^2

But since there are many terms, and some are large, perhaps I can calculate it approximately.

Alternatively, since the largest variances are from (OP, RC), (WS, DT), and (DT, AS), which are 604800, 604800, and 2592000, their variances are 604800^2 ≈ 3.66e11, and 2592000^2 ≈ 6.72e12, while others are smaller, like 86400^2 ≈ 7.46e9, which is much smaller.

So, the total variance is approximately sum of the large ones: 3.66e11 + 3.66e11 + 6.72e12 ≈ 7.45e12

Then std dev ≈ sqrt(7.45e12) ≈ 2.73e6 seconds

More precisely, let's calculate sum of variances:

Let me list them:

86400^2 = 7464960000

604800^2 = 365783040000

43200^2 = 1866240000

21600^2 = 466560000

43200^2 = 1866240000

10800^2 = 116640000

7200^2 = 51840000

604800^2 = 365783040000

2592000^2 = 6718464000000

Now, sum these up.

First, the smaller ones: 7464960000 + 1866240000 + 466560000 + 1866240000 + 116640000 + 51840000 ≈ 7.46e9 + 1.87e9 + 4.67e8 + 1.87e9 + 1.17e8 + 5.18e7 ≈ 1.18e10

Then, the larger ones: 365783040000 + 365783040000 + 6718464000000 ≈ 3.66e11 + 3.66e11 + 6.72e12 ≈ 7.45e12

So total variance ≈ 7.45e12 + 1.18e10 ≈ 7.45e12

Thus, std dev ≈ sqrt(7.45e12) ≈ 2,729,000 seconds

So, for ('SS', 'AS'): (12088800, 2729000)

Now, to summarize, I'll create the dictionary with these pairs.

But wait, I should also include some other pairs for variety.

For example, let's add ('PT', 'DT'), which is PT to PK to WS to DT.

Avg = avg(PT to PK) + avg(PK to WS) + avg(WS to DT) = 21600 + 14400 + 1209600 = 1245600 seconds

Std dev = sqrt(10800^2 + 7200^2 + 604800^2) ≈ sqrt(116640000 + 51840000 + 365783040000) ≈ sqrt(365951424000) ≈ 604950 seconds

Similarly, let's include ('OP', 'CA'), which is OP to RC to QI to CA.

Avg = 2592000 + 86400 + 43200 = 2721600 seconds

Std dev = sqrt(604800^2 + 43200^2 + 21600^2) ≈ sqrt(365783040000 + 1866240000 + 466560000) ≈ sqrt(368115840000) ≈ 606730 seconds

So, now I can compile the dictionary.

Let me list the pairs I have:

('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 86400)
('OP', 'RC'): (2592000, 604800)
('SS', 'RC'): (2851200, 610900)
('SS', 'QI'): (2937600, 612500)
('QI', 'PT'): (129600, 48300)
('CA', 'WS'): (122400, 45100)
('WS', 'AS'): (8985600, 2661690)
('SS', 'AS'): (12088800, 2729000)
('PT', 'DT'): (1245600, 604950)
('OP', 'CA'): (2721600, 606730)
Wait, actually, in the calculation for ('SS', 'RC'), I had std dev ≈ 610938, so 610900 is fine.

Similarly for others.

Now, to make it a Python dictionary, I need to use tuples for the keys and tuples for the values.

Also, since the prompt mentions that the times are in seconds, and the example uses integers, I'll round the std devs to the nearest hundred or so, but actually, since they are estimates, it's fine to keep them as is.

But to make it cleaner, perhaps I can round them to the nearest 100 seconds or something, but it's not necessary.

Alternatively, since the numbers are large, keeping them as is is acceptable.

So, finally, the temporal profile dictionary would be:

python
Wrap
Copy
temporal_profile = {

Wait, but in the prompt, the example has smaller numbers, like 86400 and 3600, but in this context, since it's a supply chain process spanning months, having large numbers makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I can scale down the times, but I think it's fine as is.

Moreover, the prompt says "do not provide explicit numerical temporal information", meaning that I should estimate them myself, which I did.

So, this should be acceptable.

I think this dictionary provides a representative subset of the activity pairs with estimated average times and standard deviations.

To address the user's query, I need to create a temporal profile for a supply chain process in manufacturing high-tech electronics. The process includes the following activities in a typical sequence: Supplier Selection (SS), Order Placement (OP), Receive Components (RC), Quality Inspection (QI), Component Assembly (CA), Product Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Warehouse Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), and After-Sales Support (AS). The task requires a Python dictionary that maps pairs of these activities—those that "eventually follow each other" in process executions—to tuples containing estimated average times and standard deviations of the temporal distances between them, expressed in seconds. Since the prompt specifies a "representative subset" and emphasizes complexity by including pairs separated by multiple steps, I will estimate these values based on reasonable assumptions about a supply chain process, as no explicit numerical data is provided.

### Understanding "Eventually Follow Each Other"
The prompt clarifies that for a trace like `<A, B, C, D>`, pairs such as `(A, B)`, `(A, C)`, `(A, D)`, `(B, C)`, `(B, D)`, and `(C, D)` are considered. This means I need to account for both consecutive activities (e.g., SS to OP) and those separated by one or more intermediate steps (e.g., SS to RC, SS to AS). For simplicity, I'll assume a linear sequence—SS → OP → RC → QI → CA → PT → PK → WS → DT → AS—since the prompt doesn't specify parallel paths or alternative routes. For non-consecutive pairs, the average time will be the sum of the average times of the consecutive segments between them, and the standard deviation will be calculated as the square root of the sum of the variances (assuming independence between segments).

### Estimating Times for Consecutive Pairs
Since no explicit temporal data is provided, I'll estimate average times and standard deviations for consecutive pairs based on typical supply chain dynamics for high-tech electronics manufacturing. All times will be converted to seconds (1 day = 86,400 seconds, 1 hour = 3,600 seconds) to match the prompt's example.

1. **SS to OP**: After selecting a supplier, placing an order involves negotiations and paperwork, typically taking a few days.  
   - Average: 3 days = 3 × 86,400 = 259,200 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 1 day = 86,400 seconds  

2. **OP to RC**: Receiving components depends on supplier lead time, often weeks to months for electronics.  
   - Average: 30 days = 30 × 86,400 = 2,592,000 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 7 days = 7 × 86,400 = 604,800 seconds  

3. **RC to QI**: Inspection begins shortly after components arrive, perhaps within a day.  
   - Average: 1 day = 86,400 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 0.5 days = 43,200 seconds  

4. **QI to CA**: Assembly follows inspection quickly if components pass, maybe half a day.  
   - Average: 12 hours = 12 × 3,600 = 43,200 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 6 hours = 6 × 3,600 = 21,600 seconds  

5. **CA to PT**: Testing follows assembly, often within a day.  
   - Average: 1 day = 86,400 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 0.5 days = 43,200 seconds  

6. **PT to PK**: Packaging is swift after testing, taking a few hours.  
   - Average: 6 hours = 6 × 3,600 = 21,600 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 3 hours = 3 × 3,600 = 10,800 seconds  

7. **PK to WS**: Moving to storage is quick, a few hours.  
   - Average: 4 hours = 4 × 3,600 = 14,400 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 2 hours = 2 × 3,600 = 7,200 seconds  

8. **WS to DT**: Distribution time varies with demand, possibly weeks.  
   - Average: 14 days = 14 × 86,400 = 1,209,600 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 7 days = 7 × 86,400 = 604,800 seconds  

9. **DT to AS**: After-sales support begins after distribution, potentially months later when issues arise.  
   - Average: 90 days = 90 × 86,400 = 7,776,000 seconds  
   - Standard Deviation: 30 days = 30 × 86,400 = 2,592,000 seconds  

### Calculating Non-Consecutive Pairs
For pairs separated by multiple steps, I’ll sum the average times of the consecutive segments. The standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the variances (variance = standard deviation squared), assuming independence. Below, I compute a subset of pairs to include in the dictionary.

- **(SS, RC)**: SS → OP → RC  
  - Average = 259,200 + 2,592,000 = 2,851,200 seconds  
  - Variance = 86,400² + 604,800² = 7,464,960,000 + 365,783,040,000 = 373,248,000,000  
  - Standard Deviation = √373,248,000,000 ≈ 610,900 seconds  

- **(SS, QI)**: SS → OP → RC → QI  
  - Average = 259,200 + 2,592,000 + 86,400 = 2,937,600 seconds  
  - Variance = 86,400² + 604,800² + 43,200² = 7,464,960,000 + 365,783,040,000 + 1,866,240,000 = 375,114,240,000  
  - Standard Deviation = √375,114,240,000 ≈ 612,500 seconds  

- **(QI, PT)**: QI → CA → PT  
  - Average = 43,200 + 86,400 = 129,600 seconds  
  - Variance = 21,600² + 43,200² = 466,560,000 + 1,866,240,000 = 2,332,800,000  
  - Standard Deviation = √2,332,800,000 ≈ 48,300 seconds  

- **(CA, WS)**: CA → PT → PK → WS  
  - Average = 86,400 + 21,600 + 14,400 = 122,400 seconds  
  - Variance = 43,200² + 10,800² + 7,200² = 1,866,240,000 + 116,640,000 + 51,840,000 = 2,034,720,000  
  - Standard Deviation = √2,034,720,000 ≈ 45,100 seconds  

- **(WS, AS)**: WS → DT → AS  
  - Average = 1,209,600 + 7,776,000 = 8,985,600 seconds  
  - Variance = 604,800² + 2,592,000² = 365,783,040,000 + 6,718,464,000,000 = 7,084,247,040,000  
  - Standard Deviation = √7,084,247,040,000 ≈ 2,661,700 seconds  

- **(SS, AS)**: SS → OP → RC → QI → CA → PT → PK → WS → DT → AS  
  - Average = 259,200 + 2,592,000 + 86,400 + 43,200 + 86,400 + 21,600 + 14,400 + 1,209,600 + 7,776,000 = 12,088,800 seconds  
  - Variance = 86,400² + 604,800² + 43,200² + 21,600² + 43,200² + 10,800² + 7,200² + 604,800² + 2,592,000² ≈ 7,452,556,800,000  
  - Standard Deviation = √7,452,556,800,000 ≈ 2,729,000 seconds  

- **(PT, DT)**: PT → PK → WS → DT  
  - Average = 21,600 + 14,400 + 1,209,600 = 1,245,600 seconds  
  - Variance = 10,800² + 7,200² + 604,800² = 116,640,000 + 51,840,000 + 365,783,040,000 = 365,951,520,000  
  - Standard Deviation = √365,951,520,000 ≈ 605,000 seconds  

### Selecting a Representative Subset
With 10 activities, there are 45 possible pairs (n × (n-1) / 2), but the prompt requests a subset. I’ll include a mix of consecutive pairs (e.g., SS to OP), pairs with a few steps between (e.g., QI to PT), and pairs spanning larger distances (e.g., SS to AS) to reflect the process’s complexity.

### Final Temporal Profile
Here is the Python dictionary representing the temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 86400),    # Consecutive: 3 days ± 1 day
    ('OP', 'RC'): (2592000, 604800),  # Consecutive: 30 days ± 7 days
    ('SS', 'RC'): (2851200, 610900),  # Two steps: SS to OP to RC
    ('SS', 'QI'): (2937600, 612500),  # Three steps: SS to OP to RC to QI
    ('QI', 'PT'): (129600, 48300),    # Two steps: QI to CA to PT
    ('CA', 'WS'): (122400, 45100),    # Three steps: CA to PT to PK to WS
    ('WS', 'AS'): (8985600, 2661700), # Two steps: WS to DT to AS
    ('SS', 'AS'): (12088800, 2729000),# Full process: SS to AS
    ('PT', 'DT'): (1245600, 605000)   # Three steps: PT to PK to WS to DT
}
```

### Verification
- **Units**: All times are in seconds, consistent with the prompt’s example (e.g., 86,400 seconds = 1 day).
- **Reasonableness**: Times reflect supply chain realities (e.g., long lead times for OP to RC, shorter times for PT to PK).
- **Complexity**: Includes pairs with varying distances (consecutive, short gaps, long spans).
- **Subset**: Nine pairs cover different phases (procurement, assembly, distribution, support).

This dictionary provides a practical temporal profile for the supply chain process, balancing detail and manageability as required.
