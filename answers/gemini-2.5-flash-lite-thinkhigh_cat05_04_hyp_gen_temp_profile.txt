### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

*   **Receive to Approve (`R` to `P`)**: The average time from claim submission (`R`) to its approval (`P`) is approximately 25 hours. The standard deviation for this interval is only 1 hour. This very low standard deviation suggests an unusually consistent or rigid timing for approvals, which is rarely seen in processes that are subject to natural variations in claim complexity, adjuster workload, or external factors.

*   **Assign to Close (`A` to `C`)**: An average of 2 hours between assigning an adjuster (`A`) and closing a claim (`C`) is observed. This duration is notably short, particularly when considering the intended sequence of steps, which usually includes evaluation and approval. Such a quick turnaround might indicate that claims are being closed prematurely or that critical intermediate steps are being bypassed.

*   **Evaluate to Notify (`E` to `N`)**: The average time between evaluating a claim (`E`) and notifying the customer (`N`) is a mere 5 minutes, with a standard deviation of just 1 minute. This extremely rapid transition is suspicious, potentially implying that the "Evaluate" step is a nominal or automated marker, or that notification occurs almost instantaneously without sufficient review or processing time.

*   **Approve to Notify (`P` to `N`)**: There is an average delay of 7 days between approving a claim (`P`) and notifying the customer (`N`), with a high standard deviation of 2 days. This lengthy average waiting period, coupled with its significant variability, suggests potential bottlenecks in the notification process, backlogs in communication, or inconsistent handling of post-approval customer outreach.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

*   **Rigid Approval Timing (`R` to `P`)**:
    *   **Hypothesis 1:** Automated approval workflows are in place, enforcing strict time limits for processing and approval, potentially overriding nuanced claim assessments.
    *   **Hypothesis 2:** Data entry practices for submission and approval timestamps may be standardized or batched, creating an artificial appearance of consistent timing.
    *   **Hypothesis 3:** Specific claim types or criteria might trigger an immediate, predefined approval path that masks the true variability of the evaluation process.

*   **Premature Closure (`A` to `C`)**:
    *   **Hypothesis 1:** Certain types of claims or specific handling rules allow for immediate closure after assignment, bypassing thorough evaluation or formal approval.
    *   **Hypothesis 2:** The 'Close' activity might be misused to signify other process states, or there are instances where claims are marked as closed due to data entry errors before all necessary steps are completed.
    *   **Hypothesis 3:** An automated system might be triggering premature closures based on initial assignment data rather than actual process completion.

*   **Rapid Evaluation-to-Notification (`E` to `N`)**:
    *   **Hypothesis 1:** The "Evaluate" step is a minimal, automated marker, and notification is a direct consequence of a status update, bypassing human review.
    *   **Hypothesis 2:** System integration issues or an automated notification system trigger immediate alerts upon the completion of a rudimentary evaluation, without allowing for additional checks.
    *   **Hypothesis 3:** Data capturing these events might be tightly coupled, indicating that the system logs these timestamps in rapid succession, implying a lack of meaningful intervening activity.

*   **Variable Notification Delays (`P` to `N`)**:
    *   **Hypothesis 1:** A significant bottleneck exists in the department or system responsible for customer notifications post-approval, leading to unpredictable delays.
    *   **Hypothesis 2:** Manual processes for preparing and sending customer notifications after approval are prone to delays due to fluctuating workloads and resource availability.
    *   **Hypothesis 3:** Approvals might be batched internally, and customer notifications are also batched or queued, resulting in highly variable lead times before customers are informed.

### SQL Query Approaches for Verification

To investigate these anomalies, we can calculate actual time intervals between activities for specific claims and identify patterns by correlating them with claim characteristics.

**1. Investigating Rigid Approval Timing (`R` to `P`):**

*   **Objective:** Identify claims where the time from 'R' to 'P' deviates significantly from the expected 25-hour average, particularly looking for claims that are much faster or slower than the narrowly predicted range.
*   **Query:**
    ```sql
    WITH ClaimInterval AS (
        SELECT
            ce1.claim_id,
            ce1.timestamp AS receive_ts,
            ce2.timestamp AS approve_ts,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS actual_duration_sec
        FROM
            claim_events ce1
        JOIN
            claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
        WHERE
            ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    )
    SELECT
        ci.claim_id,
        ci.actual_duration_sec,
        c.claim_type,
        -- Add other relevant claim details if needed
        -- For example, to check if specific adjusters are involved in faster/slower approvals,
        -- we would need to join based on the 'A' event's resource, assuming it maps to an adjuster.
        (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ci.claim_id AND activity = 'A') AS assigned_resource
    FROM
        ClaimInterval ci
    JOIN
        claims c ON ci.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE
        ci.actual_duration_sec < (90000 - 3600)  -- Significantly faster than expected average (25h - 1h)
        OR ci.actual_duration_sec > (90000 + 3600) -- Significantly slower than expected average (25h + 1h)
    ORDER BY
        ci.actual_duration_sec;
    ```

**2. Investigating Premature Closure (`A` to `C`):**

*   **Objective:** Pinpoint claims closed very quickly after assignment, potentially bypassing evaluation or approval steps.
*   **Query:**
    ```sql
    WITH AssignCloseInterval AS (
        SELECT
            ce1.claim_id,
            ce1.timestamp AS assign_ts,
            ce2.timestamp AS close_ts,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS actual_duration_sec
        FROM
            claim_events ce1
        JOIN
            claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
        WHERE
            ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    )
    SELECT
        aci.claim_id,
        aci.actual_duration_sec,
        c.claim_type,
        -- Retrieve the resource that assigned the claim for potential correlation
        (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = aci.claim_id AND activity = 'A') AS assigned_resource
    FROM
        AssignCloseInterval aci
    JOIN
        claims c ON aci.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE
        aci.actual_duration_sec < 3600 -- Focus on claims closed much faster than the 2-hour average (7200s)
                                     -- For example, less than 1 hour.
    ORDER BY
        aci.actual_duration_sec;
    ```

**3. Investigating Rapid Evaluation-to-Notification (`E` to `N`):**

*   **Objective:** Identify claims where the time between evaluation and notification is exceptionally short, suggesting skipped steps.
*   **Query:**
    ```sql
    WITH EvaluateNotifyInterval AS (
        SELECT
            ce1.claim_id,
            ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_ts,
            ce2.timestamp AS notify_ts,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS actual_duration_sec
        FROM
            claim_events ce1
        JOIN
            claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
        WHERE
            ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    )
    SELECT
        eni.claim_id,
        eni.actual_duration_sec,
        c.claim_type,
        -- Get the resource performing the 'E' activity for correlation
        (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = eni.claim_id AND activity = 'E') AS evaluator_resource
    FROM
        EvaluateNotifyInterval eni
    JOIN
        claims c ON eni.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE
        eni.actual_duration_sec < 180 -- Focus on claims where Evaluation to Notification is extremely fast (e.g., less than 3 minutes, well below the 5-minute average)
    ORDER BY
        eni.actual_duration_sec;
    ```

**4. Investigating Variable Notification Delays (`P` to `N`):**

*   **Objective:** Find claims with unusually long delays between approval and customer notification, and analyze associated claim types or resources.
*   **Query:**
    ```sql
    WITH ApproveNotifyInterval AS (
        SELECT
            ce1.claim_id,
            ce1.timestamp AS approve_ts,
            ce2.timestamp AS notify_ts,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS actual_duration_sec
        FROM
            claim_events ce1
        JOIN
            claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
        WHERE
            ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    )
    SELECT
        ani.claim_id,
        ani.actual_duration_sec,
        c.claim_type,
        adj.region AS adjuster_region -- Assuming resource from 'A' event maps to adjuster_id
    FROM
        ApproveNotifyInterval ani
    JOIN
        claims c ON ani.claim_id = c.claim_id
    LEFT JOIN -- Use LEFT JOIN in case 'A' event or adjuster mapping is missing
        claim_events assign_event ON ani.claim_id = assign_event.claim_id AND assign_event.activity = 'A'
    LEFT JOIN
        adjusters adj ON assign_event.resource = adj.adjuster_id::VARCHAR -- Join on resource (as VARCHAR) to adjuster_id
    WHERE
        ani.actual_duration_sec > (604800 + 172800) -- Focus on claims where Approve to Notify is significantly longer than average (7 days + 2 days STDEV)
                                                  -- i.e., more than 9 days delay.
    ORDER BY
        ani.actual_duration_sec DESC; -- Order by longest delays first
    ```
