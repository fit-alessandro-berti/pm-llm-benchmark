# Questions to Clarify the Property Onboarding Process

Based on your detailed explanation of the property onboarding process, I'd like to ask several questions to deepen my understanding of how this complex workflow functions:

## Documentation and Initial Review

1. What specific criteria do you use to determine if a property's documentation is sufficient to proceed with onboarding?
2. How do you handle situations where landlords have difficulty providing certain required documents?
3. Could you elaborate on how the property coordinator prioritizes incoming property requests when multiple landlords reach out simultaneously?

## Property Manager Assignment

4. What metrics or thresholds define when a property manager's workload is considered "full"?
5. How do you resolve situations where no property manager has the ideal geographic specialization or experience for a particular property?
6. Is there a formal handover process between the property coordinator and the assigned property manager?

## Inspection and Compliance

7. What happens if a property repeatedly fails inspections? Is there a point where you might decline to onboard it?
8. How do you handle urgent safety issues discovered during inspection that require immediate attention?
9. Who makes the final determination that a property meets all requirements to proceed to marketing?

## Marketing and Listing

10. How do you determine the optimal pricing strategy for each property? Who has final approval on pricing?
11. What criteria determine which marketing channels are used for different types of properties?
12. How frequently are marketing materials and listings reviewed or updated after initial creation?

## Tenant Selection

13. Could you walk me through how you handle competing applications for the same property?
14. What specific criteria might cause you to reject an otherwise qualified tenant?
15. How do you balance the landlord's preferences for tenant selection with fair housing requirements?

## Process Management and Exceptions

16. What's your typical timeline from initial landlord contact to having a tenant move in?
17. How do you track the status of properties moving through different stages of the onboarding process?
18. What are the most common bottlenecks in the process, and how do you address them?
19. Could you describe your escalation process when issues arise during onboarding?

## Communication and Technology

20. How do you ensure consistent communication between all stakeholders throughout the process?
21. What systems integration challenges have you encountered between your various property management tools?
22. How do you measure the effectiveness and efficiency of your onboarding process?

## Continuous Improvement

23. How has this onboarding process evolved over time, and what prompted those changes?
24. What feedback mechanisms do you have in place to gather input from landlords and tenants about the onboarding experience?
25. Are there any aspects of the current process you're actively working to improve?
