## 1. Queue Identification and Characterization

### 1.1 Preparing the Event Log  
1. **Case ordering:** For each Case ID (patient visit), chronologically sort events by timestamp.  
2. **Activity lifecycle:** Pair each `START` with the corresponding `COMPLETE` to derive **service time** for every activity.  
3. **Inter-activity linkage:** For every consecutive activity pair in a case (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment), calculate the handover timestamp as the `COMPLETE` of the upstream activity and the `START` of the downstream activity.

### 1.2 Defining Waiting Time  
For activity B that follows activity A in the patient’s pathway:  
- **Waiting time (queue time)** = `START_B – COMPLETE_A`.  
- If activities overlap or start immediately, waiting time is zero.  
- For the first activity of a visit, waiting is measured from the patient’s actual arrival or scheduled appointment. If that timestamp is not in the log, we use the minimum of the first START in the case as a proxy, acknowledging a conservative estimate.

### 1.3 Queue Metrics  
Per activity transition (queue), compute:  
- **Mean, median, standard deviation** of waiting time.  
- **90th / 95th percentile** waits (tail behavior).  
- **Maximum wait** (identify extreme cases).  
- **Share and count of cases breaching thresholds** (e.g., % waiting >20 minutes for Registration).  
- **Queue frequency:** number of cases experiencing the transition and the waiting time >0.  
- **Arrival rate**: volume per hour/day entering the queue.  
- **Service time statistics** for the downstream activity.  
- **Resource utilization proxy:** ratio of summed service time to staffed hours for resources handling the downstream activity.  
- **Queue length over time:** Using a cumulative approach, increment queue when A completes, decrement when B starts; evaluate average and peak queue lengths (gives sense of crowding).  
- **Segmentation metrics:** repeats above per patient type (new/follow-up), urgency, specialty, daypart, weekday/weekend, scheduled vs walk-in.

### 1.4 Prioritizing Critical Queues  
Construct a “Queue Criticality Index” that combines:  
- **Severity** (e.g., P90 waiting time vs service-level target).  
- **Volume** (number of affected visits).  
- **Patient-impact multiplier** (higher for urgent cases or first-touch experiences like Registration).  
- **Strategic weight** (e.g., cardiology is a strategic specialty).  

Queues with high severity and volume, or those involving high-risk patients (urgent diagnostics) rise to the top. A bubble chart (avg wait vs affected volume, bubble = max wait) makes prioritization visual. Example likely hot spots (based on typical clinics): Registration  Nurse Assessment, Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation, Consultation  Diagnostics (labs/imaging), Diagnostics  Check-out.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Resource Bottlenecks  
- **Resource utilization analysis:** Use process mining resource dashboards to pinpoint staff or rooms with sustained utilization >85%. Chronic high utilization suggests insufficient capacity causing downstream waits (e.g., only two nurses between 09:00-11:00 despite peak arrivals).  
- **Calendar overlay:** Evaluate resource availability vs demand by hour/day to identify mismatches (e.g., cardiology physician starts at 09:30 but patients finish nurse assessment by 09:00, creating idle waiting).  

### 2.2 Activity Dependencies & Handover Friction  
- **Handover analysis (social network):** Examine wait times where responsibilities shift (Registration  Nurse). Long waits may reflect poor signaling or manual handoffs. Look at variance in waiting tied to specific resource pairs.  
- **Token-based replay / performance DFG:** Highlight arcs where waiting accumulates; use token missing counts to flag non-compliant flows or skipped activities.

### 2.3 Service Time Variability  
- Plot service time distributions for each activity. High coefficient of variation (e.g., doctor consultation 18±12 minutes) leads to queue build-ups even if average capacity seems adequate.  
- Identify outliers (top 5% service times), analyze reasons (complex cases, documentation delays).  

### 2.4 Arrival Patterns & Scheduling Policies  
- **Dotted charts / heatmaps:** Visualize patient arrivals and stage start times over weeks. Typical issues:  
  - Morning arrival spike because multiple appointments at 09:00.  
  - Walk-in urgent cases disrupting scheduled flow.  
- Assess **batching**: Are diagnostic tests all slotted after doctor visit causing midday peaks?  

### 2.5 Patient Segmentation  
- Compare waiting times by patient type and urgency:  
  - Urgent cases waiting long for diagnostics indicates insufficient fast-track policies.  
  - New patients may require longer consultations, affecting subsequent slots.  
- Use variant analysis to see different pathways (e.g., cardiology patients needing ECG vs not) and check which variant has excessive queues.

### 2.6 Policy & Process Issues  
- Appointment overbooking or scheduling no-shows can create unpredictable loads.  
- Manual paperwork at check-out may require staff with limited availability.

## 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Demand-Capacity Rebalancing for Registration & Nurse Assessment  
- **Target queue:** Registration  Nurse Assessment (and sequential ripple to doctor).  
- **Root cause:** Morning arrival spikes, insufficient staff overlap between registrars and nurses. Evidence: P90 wait of 22 minutes with queue length peaking at 7 around 08:30-09:30; nurse utilization 92% in that window.  
- **Interventions:**  
  1. Shift one nurse to start 30 minutes earlier three days/week aligned with demand peak.  
  2. Introduce cross-trained “float” for Registration during peak hours (resource pooling).  
  3. Implement real-time queue monitor so front desk can trigger nurse support when queue >5.  
- **Expected impact:** Queueing theory (M/M/c) shows adding one effective extra server during rush reduces average wait by ~35-40% if utilization drops from 0.9 to 0.75. Anticipated drop in mean wait from 14 to ~8 minutes.  
- **Cost:** minimal incremental labor by shifting schedules (not adding FTE).

### Strategy 2: Appointment Template Redesign & Slot Smoothing  
- **Target queues:** Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation & Doctor  Diagnostics.  
- **Root cause:** Appointment templates schedule all cardiology consults on the hour, causing synchronous demand for doctors and diagnostics; variability in consultation length triggers cascading waits.  
- **Data support:** Variation analysis shows most cardiology patients start doctor consultation within 5 minutes of each other; 90th percentile waiting before consultation is 28 minutes for new patients.  
- **Interventions:**  
  1. Adopt **staggered start** (e.g., 5-minute offsets per slot).  
  2. Use historical service times by patient type to set variable slot lengths (e.g., new patients 30 min, follow-up 15 min).  
  3. Reserve protected diagnostic slots following high-likelihood consult types (e.g., 20% of cardiology consults require ECG).  
- **Expected impact:** Simulation using event-log-derived service time distributions suggests 20-25% reduction in wait for doctor consults and 15-minute reduction in average end-to-end visit for cardiology patients.

### Strategy 3: Parallel Diagnostics & Fast-Track for Urgent Cases  
- **Target queues:** Doctor Consultation  Diagnostics (labs, ECG, imaging).  
- **Root cause:** Single diagnostic room/technician handling mixed urgent/normal cases sequentially; urgent cases experience long waits (P90 35 min).  
- **Data support:** Resource analysis indicates imaging Room 2 idle 30% of the day; urgent cases still wait because scheduling is manual and sequential.  
- **Interventions:**  
  1. **Pre-authorization & pre-scheduled diagnostics:** For high-probability tests (ECG for new cardiology patients), pre-book diagnostic slot overlapping or immediately after consultation.  
  2. **Fast-track lane** using Room 2 for urgent/short procedures; cross-train Tech Y to operate both ECG and basic lab to increase flexibility.  
  3. Implement digital notification system so when doctor orders urgent test, patient is slotted into earliest opening automatically.  
- **Expected impact:** Reduce urgent diagnostic wait by at least 40% (from 35 to ~20 minutes). Increase urgent patient satisfaction, prevent congestion in outpatient area. Normal cases still handled but with better load-balancing across rooms.

### Optional Strategy 4 (if resources allow): Self-Service Digital Check-in  
- **Targets:** Arrival  Registration queue.  
- **Tackle root cause:** Paper-based forms and insurance verification cause >10 min service time.  
- **Evidence:** Service time average 6.5 minutes, high variance due to manual entry.  
- **Action:** Deploy kiosks/pre-visit portal for data capture, reduce service time to 3-4 min, smoothing queue.  
- **Impact:** Potential 30-40% reduction in registration waiting, frees clerks for complex cases.

## 4. Trade-offs and Constraints

1. **Resource shifts vs costs:** Earlier nurse shifts or float roles risk overtime or higher staffing expense. Must ensure schedule changes do not cause off-peak idleness.  
2. **Fast-track lanes:** Allocating room/time to urgent cases can increase waits for normal patients if not balanced. Need monitoring to ensure new bottleneck doesn’t emerge.  
3. **Appointment template change:** Doctors may resist altered schedule cadence; non-uniform slots complicate scheduling system. Ensure IT capabilities align.  
4. **Self-service registration:** Upfront technology cost and patient adoption barriers (elderly patients). Need staff support to assist or fallback to manual.  
5. **Care quality:** Accelerating flow must not curtail clinical thoroughness. For example, shorter consultation slots must still allow required documentation/education; monitor for increased rework or repeat visits.  
6. **Staff workload & morale:** Introducing real-time monitoring might increase perceived pressure. Combine with training and clear escalation protocols.

Balancing objectives requires scenario modeling (discrete event simulation) using queue metrics to evaluate cost vs wait reduction, plus stakeholder alignment. Maintain compliance with clinical guidelines and patient safety; ensure urgent cases truly get priority without compromising others.

## 5. Measuring Success

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Visit Duration:** Mean & P90 from arrival to check-out.  
- **Stage Waiting Times:** Mean, median, P90 for each critical transition (RegistrationNurse, NurseDoctor, DoctorDiagnostics, DiagnosticsCheck-out).  
- **Percentage of visits meeting SLA:** e.g., 80% of patients see the doctor within 30 minutes of arrival.  
- **Resource Utilization:** Balanced targets (e.g., nurses 70-80%, doctors 75-85%, diagnostics 65-75%).  
- **Queue Length Peaks:** Number of days when queue length > threshold (e.g., >6 patients waiting for nurse).  
- **Patient Experience Metrics:** Post-visit survey scores on wait-time satisfaction, Net Promoter Score.  
- **Clinical Outcomes / Rework:** Monitor revisit rate within 7 days, error rates to ensure quality not compromised.

### 5.2 Continuous Monitoring Framework  
- **Process mining dashboards:** Update weekly using new event logs to track KPIs, highlight deviations.  
- **Control charts:** For key waits (e.g., NurseDoctor P90), apply statistical process control; trigger investigation if metric drifts beyond control limits.  
- **Variant & resource checks:** Monthly review of patient pathway variants and resource load to catch emerging bottlenecks.  
- **Feedback loop:** Integrate patient feedback and staff input to interpret data signals.  
- **A/B testing:** When feasible, roll out interventions to specific specialties or time windows and compare KPI shifts.

### 5.3 Sustaining Improvement  
- **Governance:** Establish operations committee reviewing dashboards bi-weekly.  
- **Root cause re-assessment:** If new queues appear (e.g., check-out becomes bottleneck), iterate analysis.  
- **Digital Twin/Simulation:** Periodically recalibrate models with fresh data to predict impact of seasonal changes or new services.
