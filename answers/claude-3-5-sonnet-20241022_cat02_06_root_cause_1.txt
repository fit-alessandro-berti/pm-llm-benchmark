I'll analyze the event log and provide insights on the customer support ticket resolution process.

1. **Case Duration Analysis:**
- Case 101: ~2.25 hours (efficient)
- Case 102: ~25 hours (delayed)
- Case 103: ~1.33 hours (most efficient)
- Case 104: ~24 hours (delayed)
- Case 105: ~49 hours (most delayed)

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**

a) **Escalation Patterns:**
- Cases requiring escalation (102 and 105) have significantly longer resolution times
- Escalation to Level-2 appears to introduce substantial delays
- Case 102: ~25 hours with escalation
- Case 105: ~49 hours with escalation

b) **Waiting Times:**
- Significant delays observed in:
  * Case 102: ~2.5 hours gap between assignment and escalation
  * Case 104: ~3.5 hours gap between assignment and investigation
  * Case 105: ~29 hours between escalation and Level-2 investigation

c) **Investigation to Resolution Delays:**
- Case 102: ~19 hours between investigation and resolution
- Case 104: ~19 hours between investigation and resolution
- Case 105: ~19 hours between Level-2 investigation and resolution

3. **Insights and Recommendations:**

a) **Escalation Process Improvement:**
- Implement faster handoff between Level-1 and Level-2 agents
- Consider parallel processing where Level-1 can continue investigation while waiting for Level-2
- Establish clear escalation criteria to avoid unnecessary escalations

b) **Resource Management:**
- Level-2 agent availability appears to be a bottleneck
- Consider increasing Level-2 staffing during peak hours
- Implement a priority system for escalated cases

c) **Process Optimization:**
- Standardize investigation times (Case 103 shows it can be done efficiently)
- Reduce waiting time between activities by setting maximum acceptable delays
- Implement real-time monitoring of ticket progress to identify potential delays early

d) **Training and Knowledge Sharing:**
- Enhance Level-1 agent capabilities to reduce escalation needs
- Create knowledge base from resolved cases to speed up future resolutions
- Implement regular review of escalated cases to identify training opportunities

e) **Performance Metrics:**
- Set target resolution times for different ticket types
- Monitor escalation rates and resolution times by agent level
- Track and analyze waiting times between activities

The most significant performance issues appear to be related to:
1. Delays in Level-2 agent availability
2. Long waiting times between activities
3. Inconsistent handling of escalated cases

Implementing these recommendations could help reduce resolution times and improve overall service efficiency.
