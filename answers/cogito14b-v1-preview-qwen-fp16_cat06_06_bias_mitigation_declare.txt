Alright, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to understand what the original DECLARE model looks like and then figure out where to add constraints that would mitigate bias based on sensitive attributes.

Looking at the given model, there are several activities: StartApplication, FinalDecision, RequestAdditionalInfo. The succession constraint shows that after RequestAdditionalInfo comes FinalDecision. But there's nothing about checking for biases or handling sensitive attributes.

So my task is to add new constraints that ensure fairness. Let me think of possible scenarios where bias could creep in. For example, if during the application review process an activity like CheckApplicantRace happens, then it might lead directly to a decision without proper checks. That's bad because it could result in biased decisions against certain races.

I need to add constraints that prevent such direct paths and enforce checks before making decisions. Let's start by adding a ManualReview activity that must coexist with sensitive-related decisions. For example, if there's a FinalDecision_Reject_Minority (assuming the model has these activities), then it should coexist with ManualReview.

Another thing is to ensure that after any sensitive attribute check (like CheckApplicantRace), there must be a BiasMitigationCheck before reaching a decision like Approve or Reject. This can be done by adding response and succession constraints.

Also, non-succession constraints could prevent direct paths from a sensitive activity to a final decision without an intermediate step like the mitigation check.

Now I need to structure these as DECLARE constraints in the dictionary format provided. For example, under "coexistence", add entries for FinalDecision_Reject_Minority coexisting with ManualReview. Under "succession", make sure that CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck before Approve or Reject.

Let me also consider adding existence constraints for these new activities if they're not already present, but the original model might have them implicitly. So I'll focus on linking existing ones with fairness constraints.

```python
declare_model = {
    # Original constraints remain unchanged
    
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # Add existence of new fairness-related activities
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    
    "coexistence": {
        **declare_model["coexistence"],
        # Ensure sensitive decisions coexist with manual review
        "FinalDecision_Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    
    "response": {
        **declare_model["response"],
        # Ensure sensitive checks lead to bias mitigation
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "AgeVerification": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    
    "succession": {
        **declare_model["succession"],
        # Prevent direct decisions after sensitive checks
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "AgeVerification": {"Reject": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    
    "non_succession": {
        # Prevent direct paths from sensitive checks to decisions
        **declare_model["non_succession"],
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "AgeVerification": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    }
}
```

**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

1. **Existence of Fairness Activities**
   - Added `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`: These activities are essential intermediaries that ensure sensitive attributes are properly reviewed before final decisions.

2. **Coexistence Requirements**
   - Any decision involving minority applicants (`FinalDecision_Reject_Minority`, `Approve_Minority`) must coexist with a manual review.
   - This ensures human oversight for potentially biased outcomes.

3. **Response Constraints**
   - After identifying sensitive attributes (race, age), the process must first perform bias mitigation checks before proceeding.
   - Prevents automated decisions based solely on demographic information.

4. **Succession and Non-succession Controls**
   - Prohibited direct succession from sensitive attribute checks to final decisions.
   - Ensures that decision steps always include intermediate review processes.

These constraints create a structured path through the application process where:
- Sensitive attributes are first identified
- Bias mitigation is performed (required step)
- Manual reviews occur for sensitive demographic cases
- Final decisions can only follow these proper procedures

This approach helps prevent unconscious or deliberate bias by enforcing systematic checks and documentation before reaching final loan decisions.
