Final process tree that captures the behaviour in the three observed cases

-> (                                              # main sequence

        tau,                                       #     … so we skip the whole “missing-info” part

        -> (                                       # … or we have to ask for (possibly several) pieces of information
            * (                                   # ----- loop: one or more “Request Missing Info”
                'Request Missing Info (RMI)',      #        first RMI
                tau                                #        then, whenever we decide to stay in the loop, only a silent step is executed
            ),                                     #        and we start the body (RMI) again
            'Validate Form (VF)'                   # re-validation after the last RMI
        )

    'Send Confirmation (SC)',

How the tree reproduces the log:

• Case 2 (no missing information):  
  RA  VF  AE  (choose  in the XOR)  AD  SC  AC

• Case 1 (one request):  
  RA  VF  AE  (take second branch of XOR)  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

• Case 3 (two requests):  
  RA  VF  AE  (second branch)  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC  
  (first RMI is the loop body, the silent step  keeps the loop alive, then the body RMI is executed again, after which the loop is left).

This tree therefore:

1. Keeps the main flow strictly sequential.  
2. Allows any positive number of consecutive “Request Missing Info” events, followed by a single re-validation.  
3. Allows skipping the whole request/re-validation part altogether, matching cases where the form was complete from the start.
