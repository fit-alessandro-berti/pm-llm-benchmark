The main differences between these transactions can be attributed to multiple factors, such as:

1. Frequency of tenants exiting the property:
   - The transactions with higher frequency (e.g., 84, 63) have more occurrences in a shorter period compared to those with lower frequencies like 268 and 56.

2. Performance metrics:
   - As the number increases through multiple entries under each transaction, there's an upward trend.
   - Some transactions are characterized by frequent payments before lease cancellation, suggesting potential issues during contract enforcement (e.g., frequency of performance > 719990).

3. Process stage involvement:
   - The timeline shows a progression from viewing property to signing the contract and eventually moving in. Each transaction includes various internal steps that add complexity and detail into each booking.

4. Quality of screening results and their impact:
   - Screening methods vary from simple ("Screening") to extensive, with some transactions showing no further steps towards completion (e.g., 52), indicating either completed deals or a loss of interest by the tenant.

5. Timing variations for individual applications:
   - There's a mix in the overall data timing range, revealing different activity patterns and seasonal trends within these transactions that vary individually but collectively influence total outcomes.
