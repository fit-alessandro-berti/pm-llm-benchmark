### 1. Violations of Normative Rules

**Case ID: 2**

- **Timestamp:** 20240111 08:00 – Application Received  
- **Violation:** Credit Check occurred at 20240111 08:20, which is after the required credit check (must occur immediately after application received). This violates the ordering rule that a Credit Check must happen before Risk Assessment.

**Case ID: 2**

- **Timestamp:** 20240111 10:00 – Loan Decision (Rejected)  
- **Violation:** Finalize Documentation performed at 20240111 10:30. The normative constraint explicitly states that if the loan is rejected, documentation should not be finalized before closing the case. This action contradicts the strict ordering rule and must therefore be avoided.

**Case ID: 3**

- **Timestamp:** 20240112 09:00 – Application Received  
- **Violation:** Credit Check occurred at 20240114 11:00, which is more than 24 hours later. The normative rule requires that the credit check be completed within a short time window (e.g., within 24 hours) after receiving the application.

**Summary of Normative Violations**

| Case ID | Specific Rule Violated |
|---------|------------------------|
| 2       | Credit Check Order    |
| 2       | Finalize Documentation After Rejection |
| 3       | Credit Check Timing   |

### 2. Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions

**Case ID: 1**

- **Timestamp:** Inform Applicant at 20240110 13:00  
- **Desideratum Violation:** The applicant was informed within the recommended time frame (within 48 hours of loan decision). No violation here.

**Case ID: 2**

- **Timestamp:** Loan Decision at 20240111 09:00, Inform Applicant at 20240111 10:00  
- **Desideratum Violation:** The time between the loan decision and applicant notification is within the recommended window (within 48 hours). No violation here.

**Case ID: 3**

- **Timestamp:** Loan Decision at 20240114 12:00, Inform Applicant at 20240116 15:00  
- **Desideratum Violation:** The applicant was informed more than 24 hours after the loan decision. This exceeds the recommended notification timeframe of within 48 hours.

**Summary of Desiderata Failures**

| Case ID | Specific Desideratum Violated |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 3       | Inform Applicant Timing       |

### 3. Interpretations and Justifications

**Case ID: 2 – Normative Rule Violations**

- **Credit Check After Loan Decision:**  
  - **Possible Reason:** A miscommunication or error in the system where loan decisions were logged before the necessary preassessment steps (credit check) were completed. This could be due to an oversight by a team member who was also responsible for reviewing loan decisions.
  
- **Finalize Documentation Post-Rejection:**  
  - **Possible Reason:** The documentation team may have prioritized finalizing documents for approved cases first, leading to the neglected paperwork for rejected applications.

**Case ID: 3 – Normative Rule Violations**

- **Delayed Credit Check:**  
  - **Possible Reason:** Delays in processing due to a backlog of applications or perhaps the credit check required additional time (e.g., verification with external credit bureaus) that was not anticipated. This is more aligned with a desideratum rather than a strict rule.
  
- **Late Notification for Rejected Cases:**  
  - **Possible Reason:** The applicant may have been contacted through an automated system, which could have taken longer to send the rejection message.

**Case ID: 3 – Desiderata Violation**

- **Notification Timing:**  
  - **Interpretation:** The delay between loan decision and notification is likely due to inefficiencies in the communication pipeline (e.g., emails not being sent immediately or routed through multiple channels). It does not violate strict process rules but represents an area for improvement.

### Overall Recommendations

1. **Implement Automated Alerts:**  
   - Set up alerts within the system to notify both staff and applicants at each stage of the process when a rule is about to be violated, enabling immediate corrective action.

2. **Time-Box Activities:**  
   - Enforce strict time windows for critical activities like credit checks (e.g., within 24 hours) using automated reminders if delays are detected.

3. **Review Communication Systems:**  
   - Ensure that notifications reach applicants promptly by testing and optimizing the communication pipeline, especially for rejected cases where timely feedback is crucial.

4. **Staff Training on Process Flow:**  
   - Conduct regular training sessions highlighting the importance of following the strict sequence to minimize errors in documentation or decision-making steps.
