Hereâ€™s a list of targeted, open-ended questions to deepen your understanding of the property onboarding process:

### **Process Flow & Sequencing**  
1. Could you walk me through the typical timeline for onboarding a property, from initial contact to tenant move-in? Are there any steps that often cause delays?  
2. How do you ensure smooth handoffs between teams (e.g., from the property coordinator to the property manager)? Are there any bottlenecks in these transitions?  
3. Are there steps that can happen in parallel, or is the process strictly sequential?  

### **Roles & Responsibilities**  
4. Beyond the property coordinator and manager, who else is involved in the process, and what are their key responsibilities?  
5. How is the property manager assigned? Are there formal criteria (e.g., workload thresholds, expertise matching), or is it more ad hoc?  
6. Who handles disputes or disagreements between the landlord and the property manager during onboarding?  

### **Decision Criteria & Policies**  
7. How do you determine whether a property is a good fit for your portfolio? Are there red flags that would disqualify a property?  
8. What factors influence the rental price range (e.g., market trends, property condition)? Who has final approval on pricing?  
9. How do you prioritize tenants when multiple applications are received? Are there policies for handling high-demand properties?  

### **Documentation & Compliance**  
10. What happens if a landlord cannot provide required documents (e.g., outdated inspection reports)? Are there alternative verification methods?  
11. How do you ensure compliance with local housing regulations, especially when operating across multiple cities with differing laws?  
12. Who reviews and approves custom lease clauses requested by landlords? How are these tracked to avoid conflicts later?  

### **Exceptions & Edge Cases**  
13. How do you handle properties with significant repair needs? Is there a threshold for deferring onboarding until fixes are made?  
14. What happens if a property fails inspection? Are there escalation paths for urgent or costly repairs?  
15. How are disputes between landlords and tenants handled during the screening phase (e.g., conflicting references)?  

### **Communication & Tools**  
16. How is communication tracked across teams (e.g., CRM, email, project management tools)? Are there pain points in documentation?  
17. How do you keep landlords informed about onboarding progress? Are there automated status updates, or is it manual?  
18. What happens if a landlord or tenant has special requirements not covered by your standard process (e.g., unique insurance needs)?  

### **Quality Control & Continuous Improvement**  
19. How do you audit the onboarding process for consistency and compliance? Are there regular reviews or retrospectives?  
20. Have there been major process changes based on past challenges? Could you share an example?  

These questions should help uncover gaps, clarify dependencies, and reveal how the company handles complexity and exceptions. Would you like to refine any of them for a specific focus area?
