Certainly! Here's a detailed process mining analysis of the event log, mapping unlabeled sensor data to inferred manufacturing activities:

### Step 1: Data segmentation — Detect phase changes

Let's review readings to spot coherent phases:

**Events 1–3:**  
- Low temps (~20–21°C), low pressure, no vibration, no material flow, zero tool position, low energy.  
- Idle or startup/baseline state.

---

**Events 4–6:**  
- Temp jumps to 50–58°C, low-to-moderate pressure (1–1.5 bar), high vibration (30–38 Hz), significant material flow (5 units/s), increasing tool position (510mm), and higher energy use.  
- Indicates active physical process involving material application + cutting or abrasion.

---

**Events 7–8:**  
- Temp drops to 40°C, pressure rises to 2 bar, lower vibration (10 Hz), material flow reduces to 2 units/s, tool position stable (15mm), energy moderate (~2kWh).  
- Suggests assembly phase with pressure-based fitting, less cutting.

---

**Event 9:**  
- Sharp temperature spike to 80°C, high vibration (50 Hz), pressure steady at 2 bar, zero material flow, tool not moving (15mm), energy peaks at 5kWh.  
- Intense, localized process—likely welding (heat + vibration with no material flow fits this).

---

**Event 10:**  
- Rapid cooldown to 30°C, pressure drops to 1 bar, minimal vibration, no material flow, tool stable, low energy  
- Cooling/reset just after welding, possibly awaiting inspection.

---

**Events 11–12:**  
- Lower temps (25°C), low pressure, low vibrations, minimal material flow (1 unit/s), tool position increases (20mm), steady low energy.  
- Gentle activity, maybe inspection using sensors that move tool small amounts and small adjustments.

---

**Events 13–15:**  
- Baseline again: ambient temps (~20–21°C), no vibration, no material flow, zero tool position, low energy.  
- Reset/state ready to start next cycle, possibly including initial packaging or idle.

### Step 2: Assign labels to identified phases

| Phase (Event Range) | Description of pattern                                  | **Inferred Activity**                   | **Rationale**                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Events 1–3**      | Idle/baseline readings                                 | **Idle / Setup**                       | Little activity, machine baseline.                                                                            |
| **Events 4–6**      | Temp/vibration rise, flow up, increasing tool position  | **Cutting Metal**                      | Elevated temperature + vibration + material flow + tool movement indicates cutting/drilling.                  |
| **Events 7–8**      | Temperature stabilizes, increased pressure, steady flow | **Assembling Parts**                   | Less vibration, moderate flow, pressure increase fit assembly (press-fit parts, adhesive application).        |
| **Event 9**         | High temp and vibration spike, no material flow         | **Welding**                            | Sudden temperature surge and high vibration + energy are classic welding signatures.                          |
| **Event 10**        | Rapid cooldown, minimal activity                       | **Cooling / Transition**               | A cooling or brief pause post-welding before next steps.                                                      |
| **Events 11–12**    | Low, steady readings, slight flow/tool adjustments      | **Quality Inspection**                 | Minor measurements/movement and low energy imply inspection/measurement phase.                                |
| **Events 13–15**    | Return to baseline/no flow/no vibration                 | **Idle / Packaging / Reset**           | Machine reset; could represent idle time, initial packaging, or readiness for new cycle.                      |

### **Conclusion**

By analyzing sensor trends over time, I grouped events with similar characteristics and assigned high-level labels based on typical manufacturing signatures. The continuous rise and fall in temperature, vibration, material flow, and energy provide natural breakpoints indicative of distinct manufacturing activities: from startup, through cutting, assembly, welding, and inspection, and back to readiness.

This derivation supports a typical industrial fabrication cycle, reconstructed solely from numerical process monitoring data.
