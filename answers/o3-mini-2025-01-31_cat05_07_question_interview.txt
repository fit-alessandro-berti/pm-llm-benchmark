1. Can you walk me through how you initially verify the legitimacy and completeness of the landlord’s documentation? Are there specific criteria or checklists used during this stage?  
2. What happens if the landlord is slow or unable to provide updated or missing documentation? How is that situation handled in terms of timelines and escalation?  
3. How do you determine which property manager is assigned to a new property, and what specific factors have the most influence on that decision?  
4. Could you describe what typically takes place during the introductory meeting between the property manager and the landlord? How are expectations and potential challenges aligned?  
5. When scheduling the photographer and inspector, what considerations guide the timing and coordination of these visits? Is there a preset sequence, or does it vary by property type or location?  
6. In the event that the inspector identifies issues with the property, what protocols are in place? How is urgency determined and what are the criteria for engaging contractors or deciding on repairs?  
7. How does the digital marketing team determine the final pricing and positioning for the property in online listings? Are market trends integrated dynamically, or are there periodic reviews?  
8. Could you explain how the tenant screening process is managed in terms of decision-making? What are the criteria used when multiple applications are received for the same property?  
9. Once a lease agreement is finalized, what quality checks or audits are performed to ensure it complies with all internal policies and external regulations?  
10. How are exceptions handled during the onboarding process, such as properties with special insurance requirements or landlords requesting custom lease clauses? Is there a formal protocol for these cases?  
11. Can you detail how communication is maintained and tracked across the different stakeholders (regional offices, landlords, property managers, support teams) throughout the process?  
12. How do you manage potential delays or bottlenecks in the process, especially when coordination between various teams (inspection, marketing, leasing) is required?  
13. What kind of decision points are identified as critical junctures in the process, and how are these decisions documented and communicated?  
14. Are there periodic reviews or performance indicators that help refine or improve the onboarding process over time? If so, could you elaborate on how feedback is integrated?  

Each of these questions should help illuminate details around responsibilities, timing, exception handling, and overall process robustness as you work to fully understand and potentially improve the property onboarding procedure.
