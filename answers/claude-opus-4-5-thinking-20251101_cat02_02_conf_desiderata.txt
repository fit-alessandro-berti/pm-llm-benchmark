# Analysis of Loan Application Process Event Log

## 1. Normative Rule Violations

### **Case 1: COMPLIANT **
Case 1 follows all normative rules correctly:
- Proper sequence maintained: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- Credit Check (09:30) occurred before Risk Assessment (10:00) 
- Loan was approved, and Finalize Documentation (13:30) occurred before Close Case (14:00) 

**No normative violations detected.**

---

### **Case 2: NON-COMPLIANT **
Case 2 contains **three serious normative violations**:

| Violation | Description | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **1. Ordering Violation** | Risk Assessment performed *before* Credit Check | Risk Assessment at 08:20, Credit Check at 09:00 |
| **2. Forbidden Action** | Finalize Documentation performed after loan rejection | Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30, Finalize Documentation at 10:00 |
| **3. Skipped Activity** | "Inform Applicant" is entirely missing from the case | Sequence jumps from Loan Decision  Finalize Documentation  Close Case |

**Explanation:**
- The process violated the mandatory ordering rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment
- Despite the loan being rejected, documentation was finalized—explicitly forbidden by the rules
- The applicant was never informed of the decision, skipping a required activity

---

### **Case 3: COMPLIANT **
Case 3 follows all normative rules correctly:
- Proper sequence maintained throughout
- Credit Check (Jan 14, 10:00) occurred before Risk Assessment (Jan 14, 11:00) 
- Loan was approved, and Finalize Documentation (Jan 17, 09:00) occurred before Close Case (Jan 17, 10:00) 

**No normative violations detected.**

## 2. Desiderata (Best Practice) Violations

### **Case 1: Minor Deviation**
| Desideratum | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Credit Check within 24 hours |  Met | Completed in 30 minutes |
| Inform Applicant within 48 hours |  Met | Completed in 2 hours |
| Follow-up Call performed |  Not performed | Optional, but recommended |

**Assessment:** Nearly ideal execution; only the optional follow-up call was omitted.

---

### **Case 2: Desiderata Overshadowed by Normative Issues**
| Desideratum | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Credit Check within 24 hours |  Met | 1 hour (though performed out of order) |
| Inform Applicant within 48 hours |  Not applicable | Activity was skipped entirely |
| Follow-up Call performed |  Not performed | Optional |

**Assessment:** While timing was technically met for the Credit Check, the normative violations are far more serious concerns.

---

### **Case 3: Multiple Desiderata Violations**
| Desideratum | Status | Measurement |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Credit Check within 24 hours |  Violated | ~49 hours (Application: Jan 12 09:00  Credit Check: Jan 14 10:00) |
| Inform Applicant within 48 hours |  Violated | ~51 hours (Loan Decision: Jan 14 12:00  Inform Applicant: Jan 16 15:00) |
| Follow-up Call performed |  Not performed | Optional, but recommended |

**Assessment:** All three desiderata were not met. However, these are suboptimal behaviors rather than serious violations.

## 3. Possible Interpretations and Justifications

### **Case 2 Interpretations:**
While Case 2 clearly violates normative rules, potential (though not excusable) explanations might include:

1. **Order Violation (Risk Assessment before Credit Check):**
   - Possible human error or system glitch that allowed Risk Assessment to be triggered prematurely
   - Perhaps an urgent case where staff attempted to expedite, inadvertently skipping steps

2. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**
   - Staff may have begun documentation before the decision was recorded, then failed to abort the process
   - Possible misunderstanding of the rejection outcome

3. **Missing "Inform Applicant":**
   - Could indicate incomplete logging (activity performed but not recorded)
   - Alternatively, a genuine oversight requiring corrective action

**Recommendation:** Case 2 requires immediate review and corrective measures.

---

### **Case 3 Interpretations:**
The desiderata violations in Case 3 may have reasonable explanations:

1. **Credit Check Delay (49 hours):**
   - Weekend or holiday intervening between Jan 12 and Jan 14
   - External credit bureau delays or system unavailability
   - High workload causing backlog

2. **Inform Applicant Delay (51 hours):**
   - Difficulty reaching the applicant (e.g., scheduling a phone call)
   - Internal approval processes for communication
   - Again, possible weekend/non-working hours

3. **No Follow-up Call:**
   - May not be necessary if the applicant acknowledged receipt of information
   - Resource constraints prioritizing other tasks

**Recommendation:** While understandable, Case 3 represents opportunities for process improvement to meet best-practice timelines.
