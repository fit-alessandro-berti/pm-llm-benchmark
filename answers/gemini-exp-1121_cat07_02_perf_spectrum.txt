The visualization shows a Sankey diagram over a period of time from 2000-01-25 01:00:00 to 2013-04-24 02:00:00. There are three stages shown, and there is a large volume of flows from the first stage, Send Fine, to the second stage, Insert Fine Notification, and a smaller volume of flows from Insert Fine Notification to Send for Credit Collection. All of the flows from the first stage go to the second stage and the third stage. The flows are mainly in grey and pink. The majority of flows take a short time to transition between stages. The time between 2006-09-09 02:00:00 and 2013-04-24 02:00:00 shows many flows from Send Fine stage directly transition to the Send for Credit Collection stage. In the middle of the time line, the transition between Send Fine and Insert Fine Notification takes a longer period.
