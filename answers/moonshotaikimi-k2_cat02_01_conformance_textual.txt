Deviations found in the event log
================================

| Case | Is compliant? | Violation(s) [ citation from normative description ] |
|------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    |  **YES**     | — none — the sequence *Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close* is exactly the *“expected flow when inventory is sufficient”*. |
| 2    |  **NO**      | **Payment authorization runs after packaging.**<br>- “Authorize **payment**… should only occur … **before** **packaging**” is violated, because *Authorise payment* is recorded at 10:30 **after** *Package items* at 10:00. |
| 3    |  **NO**      | **Shipping after an explicit cancellation.**<br>- Once *Cancel order* was performed at 10:00, the norm prescribes “it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for *fulfilment* (such as … **shipping**)”. Yet *Ship order* is executed at 10:30. |
| 4    |  **YES**     | — none — the shortened path *Receive  Check  Cancel  Close* mirrors the normatively defined insufficient-stock scenario. |
| 5    |  **NO**      | **Shipment without prior packaging.**<br>- The norm states that items must be *packaged* before they can be **shipped** (“*Ship order* should only occur **after** *Package items*”). Case 5 jumps directly from *Authorize payment* to *Ship order*, skipping packaging.
