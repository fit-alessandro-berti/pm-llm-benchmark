The graphic is a Business-Process-Model-and-Notation (BPMN) diagram that shows, step by step, how a make-to-order company handles an incoming customer order.  
Key structural features  

1. Four horizontal swim-lanes (organisational units)  
   • Sales (top lane)  
   • Production  
   • Procurement  
   • Warehouse (bottom lane)

2. Symbols follow the BPMN palette  
   • Circles = start/ end events  
   • Rounded rectangles = activities / tasks  
   • Diamonds = gateways (yes/no or branching decisions)  
   • Envelopes = message events (hand-offs between lanes)  
   • Cylinder = data store (customer database)  
   • Sub-process frame with a “+” sign indicates detail collapsed inside.  
   • Dashed arrows = asynchronous message flow between lanes; solid arrows = in-lane sequence flow.

Flow narrative  

A. Sales lane  
   1. Start event labelled “Monday morning”.  
   2. “Check order for completeness”.  
   3. Decision “Is the customer already in the database?”  
      – If no, task “Add customer to the database”, then re-join.  
   4. Message task “Send order details” passes a dashed message to Production and Procurement.  
   5. When a dashed message “Product sent” returns from Warehouse, Sales drafts the invoice and ends.

B. Production lane  
   1. Message start event “Order details arrive”.  
   2. “Plan production”.  
   3. Gateway: Is material OK?  
      – If material is not yet confirmed, an intermediate message event waits for confirmation from Procurement.  
   4. “Manufacture product”.  
   5. End event “Product complete”, which sends two dashed messages:  
      • to Warehouse (“Product complete”) so the goods can be shipped, and  
      • back to Sales (“Product complete”) as an information update.

C. Procurement lane  
   1. Message start event “Order details arrive”.  
   2. Collapsed sub-process “Material compensation”: inside it, materials are ordered and, if unusable, sent back (a dotted arrow leads to a “Return material” task).  
   3. “Check materials” task with an intermediate quality-check event.  
      – If the material fails, an end event “Order cancellation” is triggered and a dashed cancel message is sent to Production.  
      – If the material passes, a dashed message “Material not faulty” is sent to Production to let manufacturing proceed.

D. Warehouse lane  
   1. Message start “Product complete” arrives from Production.  
   2. “Send product”.  
   3. End event “Product sent”, which sends confirmation back to Sales.

Overall logic  

• Sales owns customer interaction and billing.  
• Production cannot build until it knows material quality; it waits for Procurement’s feedback.  
• Procurement can abort the entire order if material fails inspection.  
• Warehouse ships only after Production finishes, and its confirmation then lets Sales invoice.  

The dotted message lines make the cross-lane dependencies easy to see, while the gateways highlight the two critical decision points: customer existence and material quality.
