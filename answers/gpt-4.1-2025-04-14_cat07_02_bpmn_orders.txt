Certainly! The provided visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram**. It illustrates a typical **order fulfillment process** in an organization and is divided into four lanes, each representing a different department:

## **Lanes/Departments:**
1. **Sales**
2. **Production**
3. **Procurement**
4. **Warehouse**

---

## **Step-by-Step Process Description:**

### **1. Sales Lane:**
- The process starts on "Monday morning."
- **Check order for completeness.**
- **Check if customer is already in the database:**
  - If **not**, “Add customer to the database.”
  - If **yes**, proceed to next step.
- **Send order details** to the Production and Procurement Departments.
- **Draft invoice** once the product is sent.

### **2. Production Lane:**
- Waits for **order details** to arrive from Sales.
- **Plan production.**
- **Check if materials are available** (intersection with Procurement).
  - If materials are faulty, request material compensation from Procurement.
- **Manufacture product** once materials are confirmed.
- Once the product is complete, notify the Warehouse and Sales.

### **3. Procurement Lane:**
- Receives **order details** from Sales.
- **Material Compensation Subprocess:**
  - **Order materials**.
  - If materials are not adequate, **return material** and re-order.
- **Check materials** when they arrive.
  - If not adequate, **cancel order**.
  - If adequate, notify Production.

### **4. Warehouse Lane:**
- **Send product** once production is complete and ready.
- Notify Sales that the **product is sent**.

## **Other Notable Points:**

- **Dashed lines/arrows:** Indicate the flow of information and coordination between lanes.
- **Events (circles):** Such as start, intermediate, and end points.
- **Gateways (diamonds):** Decisions within the process (e.g., if customer exists in database or material is not faulty).
- **Subprocesses (rounded rectangles with a plus):** For modular activities like “Material Compensation Subprocess.”

## **Purpose:**
This diagram is used for business process optimization, making it clear how different departments collaborate to fulfill an order—from receiving and processing it, to procurement and manufacturing, and finally delivering the product.
