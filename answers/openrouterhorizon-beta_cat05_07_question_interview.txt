Here are targeted, open-ended questions to deepen understanding of the onboarding process:

Scope and triggers
1) What events or inputs formally trigger the start of onboarding, and what criteria must be met before the process is considered “initiated” versus just an inquiry?
2) How do you define the end of onboarding—what exact milestones must be completed for a property to be considered fully onboarded?

Documentation and verification
3) What specific documents are mandatory versus optional, and how do you handle jurisdictional differences in required compliance documents?
4) How do you track document validity (expiry dates, renewals), and who is accountable for follow-ups if items are missing or outdated?
5) Are there service-level targets for document verification turnaround, and what happens if landlords are slow to respond?

Roles and responsibilities
6) Can you map responsibilities across roles (coordinator, property manager, compliance officer, financial analyst, IT, marketing, leasing agents)? Where do handoffs occur and how are they documented?
7) Who has decision authority at each key point (assigning a manager, approving special clauses, setting the final rent, activating the listing)?

Assignment of property manager
8) How do you evaluate workload, geographic fit, and experience—do you have thresholds or scoring criteria for assignment?
9) In cases where no manager cleanly fits, how are tradeoffs made and who arbitrates?

Owner alignment and policies
10) What standard policies are non-negotiable (e.g., fair housing, safety) versus negotiable (e.g., pets, furnished, payment channels)?
11) How are special landlord requirements captured, approved, and communicated downstream to marketing, leasing, and compliance?

Inspections, photography, and remediation
12) What are the scheduling lead times and dependencies for inspections and photography, and can they occur in parallel?
13) What categories of inspection findings exist (e.g., critical vs. minor), and what are the thresholds for delaying activation?
14) How do you select and manage contractors for remediation—who approves scope, budget, and timelines?
15) How are cost responsibilities between the landlord and the company determined for repairs or upgrades?

Pricing and marketing
16) How is the initial rental price range set, and what inputs feed the pricing model (market comps, seasonality, unit features)?
17) Who can override the pricing model, and under what circumstances?
18) What is the review/approval process for marketing materials and listing content? Are there brand or compliance checks before publication?

Activation and tenant screening
19) What criteria must be met before the property is marked “activated” across systems?
20) How are tenant screening standards defined (credit thresholds, income multiples, reference requirements), and can they be tailored per property or landlord?
21) When multiple qualified applicants exist, what decision framework is used to select a tenant or negotiate terms?

Lease finalization and move-in
22) How are lease templates managed and customized, and who approves deviations or custom clauses?
23) What is the sequence for signing, deposits, and scheduling move-in? Are there dependencies that commonly cause delays?

Compliance and audits
24) What compliance checks occur pre-listing vs. pre-lease vs. post-lease, and what triggers each review?
25) How does the compliance team handle potential fair housing risks in marketing language and tenant selection?
26) What financial validations are performed (e.g., profitability thresholds, fee structures), and what happens if targets aren’t met?

Systems and data integrity
27) Which systems are the sources of truth for property data, lease data, and marketing content, and how are they synchronized?
28) How are data discrepancies identified and resolved, and who owns data quality at each stage?

Timelines, SLAs, and bottlenecks
29) What are typical cycle times for each phase, and where do bottlenecks most often occur?
30) Do you have SLAs with internal teams (marketing, IT, compliance) and external vendors (inspectors, photographers)? How are misses escalated?

Exceptions and edge cases
31) How do you handle properties requiring special insurance, unique amenities, or non-standard local regulations?
32) What is your approach when landlords request terms that conflict with policy or compliance? How are compromises documented and approved?
33) How are urgent or high-priority properties expedited without bypassing critical checks?

Communication and governance
34) How is cross-team communication coordinated—what tools, cadences, and artifacts (checklists, playbooks) are used?
35) How are decisions and rationales recorded for auditability and future reference?
36) What metrics or dashboards do you use to monitor onboarding performance and quality?

Post-onboarding feedback and continuous improvement
37) Do you conduct post-mortems or feedback loops after onboarding, and how do insights feed into process updates?
38) How are landlord and tenant satisfaction measured during/after onboarding, and what actions follow negative feedback?

Risk management and escalation
39) What are the top risks in onboarding (legal, financial, operational), and what controls are in place to mitigate them?
40) What is the escalation path for stalled cases, disputes, or non-compliant findings, and who has final decision rights?
