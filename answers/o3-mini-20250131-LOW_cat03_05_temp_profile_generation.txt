Below is one example of how such a temporal profile dictionary might be constructed. In this example we assign estimated average delays (in seconds) and standard deviations for not only sequential steps but for pairs of activities that are eventually reached later in the process. Note that the numbers here are only illustrative approximations meant to capture the idea of variability across many process executions:

------------------------------------------------------------
# Example temporal profile for the global supply chain process

temporal_profile = {
    # Direct following activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 7200),    # Supplier Selection  Order Placement (~2 days avg, with slight variability)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (86400, 3600),      # Order Placement  Receive Components (~1 day avg)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 3600),      # Receive Components  Quality Inspection (~12 hours avg)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (21600, 1800),      # Quality Inspection  Component Assembly (~6 hours avg)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (28800, 3600),      # Component Assembly  Product Testing (~8 hours avg)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 1800),      # Product Testing  Packaging (~4 hours avg)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 900),        # Packaging  Warehouse Storage (~2 hours avg)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (28800, 3600),      # Warehouse Storage  Distribution (~8 hours avg)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 7200),      # Distribution  After-Sales Support (~1 day avg)
    
    # Longer-range correlations (activities not directly following but observed to be temporally correlated)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (259200, 10800),    # From Supplier Selection all the way to Receiving Components (~3 days avg)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (259200, 10800),    # Supplier Selection  Quality Inspection (reflecting overall process lead time variability)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (172800, 7200),     # Order Placement  Quality Inspection (~2 days avg)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (194400, 7200),     # Order Placement  Component Assembly (~2.25 days avg)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (64800, 3600),      # Receive Components  Component Assembly (~18 hours avg)
    ('RC', 'PT'): (86400, 5400),      # Receive Components  Product Testing (~1 day avg)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (50400, 3600),      # Quality Inspection  Product Testing (~14 hours avg)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (43200, 3600),      # Component Assembly  Packaging (~12 hours avg)
    ('PT', 'WS'): (21600, 1800),      # Product Testing  Warehouse Storage (~6 hours avg)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (36000, 1800),      # Packaging  Distribution (~10 hours avg)
}

# This dictionary provides a representative subset of temporal correlations across the process:
# - Directly connected events (e.g., ('SS', 'OP')) capture immediate delays.
# - Indirect pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'RC')) help identify deviations that might indicate issues spanning multiple steps.
# Each tuple value is in the form (average_time_in_seconds, standard_deviation_in_seconds).

This construction enables process mining or conformance checking to flag any execution where the time difference between events falls outside the range defined by (AVG - ZETA * STDEV) or (AVG + ZETA * STDEV) for a given ZETA value. Adjustments can be made by further analyzing detailed event logs in your domain.
