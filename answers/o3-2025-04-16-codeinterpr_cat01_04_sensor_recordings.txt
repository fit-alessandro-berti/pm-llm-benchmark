Below is one possible way to translate the raw numbers into business-level, human-readable activities.  
(The same logic could be automated, but here it is expressed qualitatively for clarity.)


Inferred Phases and Their Constituent Events

1. Material Loading / Machine Idle Events 1-3  
2. Cutting Metal Events 4-6  
3. Assembling Parts (positioning & fastening) Events 7-8  
4. Welding Event 9  
5. Quality Inspection Events 10-12  
6. Unload / Packaging / Return-to-Home Events 13-15  


Why each label was chosen

Phase 1 – Material Loading / Machine Idle (Events 1-3)  
• Temperature, pressure, vibration and flow all sit at, or just above, ambient (20 °C, 1 bar, 0 Hz, 0 units/s).  
• Energy draw is minimal (0.4–0.5 kWh).  
• Tool position is at 0 mm, meaning the tool is retracted or waiting.  
 The machine is powered but not processing material—typical of loading or standby.

Phase 2 – Cutting Metal (Events 4-6)  
• Sharp rise in temperature (20  58 °C) and vibration (0  38 Hz).  
• Material flow appears (5 units/s) and tool advances from 5  10 mm.  
• Energy consumption triples (2  3 kWh).  
 A rotating or reciprocating cutting tool engages the workpiece, producing heat, chips (flow), and high mechanical vibration.

Phase 3 – Assembling Parts (Events 7-8)  
• Temperature falls to a moderate 40 °C; vibration drops to 10 Hz (far below cutting).  
• Pressure rises slightly to 2 bar while a small, steady flow (2 units/s) is present—could be adhesive or fastening feed.  
• Tool moves to its final assembly position (15 mm) but stays there.  
• Energy use steady at 2 kWh.  
 The intense cutting has ended; the machine is holding pieces together, applying pressure, and perhaps dispensing fasteners or adhesive.

Phase 4 – Welding (Event 9)  
• Temperature spikes to 80 °C, the highest in the log; vibration jumps to 50 Hz.  
• Material flow drops to 0 units/s (no feedstock; welding wire may be internally fed).  
• Energy consumption peaks at 5 kWh—characteristic of an electric arc or laser welding pulse.  
 A short, high-energy thermal operation fits welding.

Phase 5 – Quality Inspection (Events 10-12)  
• Temperature quickly returns to near-ambient (25-30 °C); vibration is very low (1-5 Hz).  
• Minimal material flow (0–1 units/s) and modest energy (1–1.6 kWh).  
• Tool position makes small probing moves (15  20 mm).  
 Sensors or a probe are measuring the welded/assembled part—typical of an inspection or gauging step.

Phase 6 – Unload / Packaging / Return-to-Home (Events 13-15)  
• All variables settle back to the same levels as Phase 1 (ambient conditions, low energy).  
• Tool position resets to 0 mm, indicating retraction.  
 The part has passed inspection; the machine either packages the part or simply returns to an idle “home” position, ready for the next cycle.

This labeled sequence converts the raw sensor traces into a high-level, human-readable manufacturing process model that can now be used for further process-mining tasks such as frequency analysis, conformance checking, or performance benchmarking.
