Here's an example of a DECLARE model for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process, where the main activities could include "Issue Purchase Order"  "Receive Goods"  "Authorize Receipt"  "Create Invoices"  "Process Invoices"  "Payment".

```python
pm4py DECLARE model = {
    'existence': {'Issue Purchase Order': 1.0, 'Receive Goods': 1.0, 'Authorize Receipt': 1.0, 'Create Invoices': 1.0, 'Process Invoices': 1.0, 'Payment': 1.0},
    'absence': {},
    'exactly_one': {},
    'init': {'Issue Purchase Order': 1.0},
    'responded_existence': {},
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {'Receive Goods': {'Issue Purchase Order': 1.0}, 'Authorize Receipt': {'Receive Goods': 1.0}, 'Create Invoices': {'Authorize Receipt': 1.0}, 'Process Invoices': {'Create Invoices': 1.0}, 'Payment': {'Process Invoices': 1.0}},
    'precedence': {'Process Invoices': {'Create Invoices': 1.0}, 'Payment': {'Process Invoices': 1.0}},
    'succession': {'Issue Purchase Order': {'Receive Goods': 1.0}, 'Receive Goods': {'Authorize Receipt': 1.0}, 'Authorize Receipt': {'Create Invoices': 1.0}, 'Create Invoices': {'Process Invoices': 1.0}, 'Process Invoices': {'Payment': 1.0}},
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {},
    'chainprecedence': {},
    'chainsuccession': {},
    'noncoexistence': {'Issue Purchase Order': {'Receive Goods': 1.0}},
    'nonsuccession': {},
    'nonchainsuccession': {},
}
```
In this model:

- **Existence** ensures that all the activities happen at least one time.
- **Initialization** starts with the activity of "Issuing a Purchase Order".
- **Response** sets the sequence of activities as described in the flow of a P2P process.
- **Precedence**, **succession**, and similar rules manage the exact and direct order in which the activities
