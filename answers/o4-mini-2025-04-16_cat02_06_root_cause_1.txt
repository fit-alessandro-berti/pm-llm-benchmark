1. Cases with unusually long cycle times  
- Case 105: ~49 hours (20240301 08:25  20240303 09:30)  
- Case 102: ~25 hours (20240301 08:05  20240302 09:15)  
- Case 104: ~24 hours (20240301 08:20  20240302 08:30)  
In contrast, Cases 101 and 103 closed in under 2¼ hours and 1½ hours, respectively.

2. Rootcause patterns  
a) Escalations introduce long “handoff” delays  
• Case 105: Escalated at 20240301 10:00, but Level2 didn’t investigate until next day 14:00 (28 h later).  
• Case 102: Escalated at 11:30, investigated at 14:00 (2.5 h later), then resolution only next morning (19 h overnight delay).  
b) Overnight / outofhours gaps  
• Case 104: Investigation at 13:00, but “Resolve” not until 08:00 next day (19 h wait), even without escalation.  
c) Unnecessary staging between steps  
• AssigntoInvestigate lag: in fast cases (101, 103) typically <45 min; in slow ones (104) it was 3½ h.  

3. How these factors inflate cycle time  
- Escalations without SLAs or 24×7 Level2 coverage create multiday handoffs.  
- Nonurgent resolution steps are deferred overnight rather than picked up by an oncall team.  
- Manual triage/assignment queues build up, particularly before investigation and resolution.  

4. Recommendations to reduce delays  
a) Enforce escalation SLAs  
• Define maximum “time to Level2 investigation” (e.g. 4 h). Automate reminders and escalations if breached.  
b) Extend coverage or introduce oncall rotations  
• Ensure at least minimal Level2 capacity outside core hours to avoid multiday gaps.  
c) Streamline handoffs with automation  
• Automate ticket routing and alerts. Preassign specialists based on issue type to reduce queue time.  
d) Monitor key “waiting time” metrics  
• Track and report average durations between critical activities (Assign  Investigate, Investigate  Resolve). Set improvement targets.  
e) Crosstrain Level1 agents  
• Empower Level1 with common Level2 skills to resolve more issues without formal escalation.  

Implementing these measures should tighten handoff windows, eliminate unnecessary overnight waits, and cut average resolution times back into the singledigithour range.
