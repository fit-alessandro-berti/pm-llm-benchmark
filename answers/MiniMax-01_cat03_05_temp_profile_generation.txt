To construct a representative temporal profile for the global supply chain process, we need to estimate the average times and standard deviations for various pairs of activities. These estimates should reflect the typical durations and variabilities in a high-tech electronics manufacturing process. Below is a Python dictionary that includes a subset of activity pairs, considering both direct and indirect connections between activities:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct Transitions
    ('SS', 'OP'): (2 * 86400, 86400),       # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: 2 days ± 1 day
    ('OP', 'RC'): (5 * 86400, 2 * 86400),   # Order Placement to Receive Components: 5 days ± 2 days
    ('RC', 'QI'): (1 * 86400, 4 * 3600),    # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: 1 day ± 4 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (4 * 3600, 3600),         # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: 4 hours ± 1 hour
    ('CA', 'PT'): (8 * 3600, 2 * 3600),     # Component Assembly to Product Testing: 8 hours ± 2 hours
    ('PT', 'PK'): (2 * 3600, 3600),         # Product Testing to Packaging: 2 hours ± 1 hour
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1 * 3600, 1800),         # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: 1 hour ± 30 minutes
    ('WS', 'DT'): (2 * 86400, 86400),       # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: 2 days ± 1 day
    ('DT', 'AS'): (3 * 86400, 2 * 86400),   # Distribution to After-Sales Support: 3 days ± 2 days

    # Indirect Transitions
    ('SS', 'RC'): (7 * 86400, 3 * 86400),   # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: 7 days ± 3 days
    ('OP', 'QI'): (6 * 86400, 3 * 86400),   # Order Placement to Quality Inspection: 6 days ± 3 days
    ('RC', 'CA'): (5 * 3600, 2 * 3600),     # Receive Components to Component Assembly: 5 hours ± 2 hours
    ('QI', 'PT'): (12 * 3600, 4 * 3600),    # Quality Inspection to Product Testing: 12 hours ± 4 hours
    ('CA', 'PK'): (10 * 3600, 3 * 3600),    # Component Assembly to Packaging: 10 hours ± 3 hours
    ('PT', 'WS'): (3 * 3600, 1800),         # Product Testing to Warehouse Storage: 3 hours ± 30 minutes
    ('PK', 'DT'): (3 * 86400, 2 * 86400),   # Packaging to Distribution: 3 days ± 2 days
    ('WS', 'AS'): (5 * 86400, 3 * 86400),   # Warehouse Storage to After-Sales Support: 5 days ± 3 days
    ('DT', 'QI'): (4 * 86400, 2 * 86400),   # Distribution to Quality Inspection (e.g., for returns): 4 days ± 2 days
    ('AS', 'SS'): (30 * 86400, 10 * 86400) # After-Sales Support to Supplier Selection (e.g., for supplier review): 30 days ± 10 days
}
```

### Explanation of the Temporal Profile:

1. **Direct Transitions**: These are the most straightforward connections between activities, representing the typical flow of the process.
   - **('SS', 'OP')**: Supplier Selection to Order Placement typically takes 2 days with a variability of ±1 day.
   - **('OP', 'RC')**: Order Placement to Receive Components takes about 5 days with a variability of ±2 days.
   - **('RC', 'QI')**: Receiving Components to Quality Inspection takes 1 day with a variability of ±4 hours.
   - **('QI', 'CA')**: Quality Inspection to Component Assembly takes 4 hours with a variability of ±1 hour.
   - **('CA', 'PT')**: Component Assembly to Product Testing takes 8 hours with a variability of ±2 hours.
   - **('PT', 'PK')**: Product Testing to Packaging takes 2 hours with a variability of ±1 hour.
   - **('PK', 'WS')**: Packaging to Warehouse Storage takes 1 hour with a variability of ±30 minutes.
   - **('WS', 'DT')**: Warehouse Storage to Distribution takes 2 days with a variability of ±1 day.
   - **('DT', 'AS')**: Distribution to After-Sales Support takes 3 days with a variability of ±2 days.

2. **Indirect Transitions**: These pairs represent activities that are not directly connected but may occur in sequence over the process execution.
   - **('SS', 'RC')**: Supplier Selection to Receive Components takes 7 days with a variability of ±3 days.
   - **('OP', 'QI')**: Order Placement to Quality Inspection takes 6 days with a variability of ±3 days.
   - **('RC', 'CA')**: Receiving Components to Component Assembly takes 5 hours with a variability of ±2 hours.
   - **('QI', 'PT')**: Quality Inspection to Product Testing takes 12 hours with a variability of ±4 hours.
   - **('CA', 'PK')**: Component Assembly to Packaging takes 10 hours with a variability of ±3 hours.
   - **('PT', 'WS')**: Product Testing to Warehouse Storage takes 3 hours with a variability of ±30 minutes.
   - **('PK', 'DT')**: Packaging to Distribution takes 3 days with a variability of ±2 days.
   - **('WS', 'AS')**: Warehouse Storage to After-Sales Support takes 5 days with a variability of ±3 days.
   - **('DT', 'QI')**: Distribution to Quality Inspection (e.g., for returns) takes 4 days with a variability of ±2 days.
   - **('AS', 'SS')**: After-Sales Support to Supplier Selection (e.g., for supplier review) takes 30 days with a variability of ±10 days.

### Notes:
- The estimates provided are hypothetical and based on typical durations in a high-tech electronics supply chain. Actual times may vary depending on specific circumstances and business practices.
- The standard deviations are chosen to reflect the variability inherent in each transition, accounting for potential delays or expedited processes.
- The indirect transitions capture the complexity of the process, where activities may not follow a strictly linear path.

This temporal profile can be used to monitor and analyze the supply chain process, identifying deviations that may require attention or process improvements.
