The optimization of the BPMN process to reduce turnaround times and enhance flexibility while incorporating automation, dynamic resource reallocation, and predictive analytics can significantly transform the efficiency and responsiveness of handling customer requests. Below are revised tasks, new gateways, and subprocesses, along with their potential impact on performance, customer satisfaction, and operational complexity.

1. Automation Integration:
   - Task B1 (Perform Standard Validation): This task can now include automatic credit and inventory checks using integrated systems. Generate rules or machine learning models that correlate patterns in customer profiles with past performance to speed up decision making.
   - Task B2 (Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis): Integrate an AI-based feasibility analysis tool that considers current stock, historical sales data, and trend analysis to determine feasibility more quickly.

2. Dynamic Resource Reallocation:
   - Parallel Checks (Credit and Inventory): Utilize a resource orchestration tool that automatically scales up or down computing resources based on the demand, ensuring optimum utilization of existing resources and reduced wait times for assessments.

3. Predictive Analytics Implementation:
   - Before the XOR (Check Request Type) gateway, introduce a Predictive Analysis Gateway: "Analyze Request Likelihood of Customization."
     - If the analysis predicts a high probability of custom requests, pre-emptively allocate resources and initiate Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation).
     - If the prediction indicates standard requests, proceed with Knowledge Gateway (XOR) as usual.

New Decision Gateways/Processes:

1. "Analyze Request Likelihood of Customization" Gateway: Utilize machine learning algorithms that consider past request data, time of year, customer history, and other relevant factors to predict the likelihood of a request being customized.

2. Pre-approval Process (Parallel to Manager Approval): For custom requests, initiate a background pre-approval process where a dedicated team can collate quotes and required resources, thus speeding up subsequent manager approval if necessary.

Revised Performance, Customer Satisfaction, and Operational Impact:

- Task A (Receive Customer Request) automatically routes to optimized queues using an intelligent initial routing engine that considers customer data and request characteristics.
- Increased efficiency is achieved as predictive analytics helps in quickly identifying non-standard requests, thereby reducing overall waiting times. 
- Dynamic resource allocation ensures cost-effective use of resources, preventing either underutilization or resource bottlenecks.
- The complexity of operations increases due to the integration and management of multiple new systems and procedures but is justified by the substantial gains in processing times, increased throughput, and customer satisfaction.
- Operationally, there's an upfront investment in technology and training, but the long-term benefits include scalability and the capability to handle a growing influx of requests with maintained or improved accuracy and response times.
- Valuing customer experience, the system proactively adjusts its approach based on the individual nature of each request, leading to personalized service, faster turnaround, and potentially higher customer loyalty.

To summarize, the BPMN process's transformation through embracing automation, dynamic resource management, and predictive analytics can transform customer request handling from a linear, reactive process to a proactive, optimized system that not only reduces waiting times but also elevates the overall service experience.
