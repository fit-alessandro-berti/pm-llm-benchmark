Here’s one way to break down the interleaved events into three distinct patient journeys (“cases”) based on patient demographics, department flows, and the logical activity sequences:

  
Case 1 – 45-year-old Male (ER pathway)

• Event 1 – 08:05:13Z  
Activity: Register patient Department: ER  
(45 M, insurance=private)

• Event 4 – 08:10:50Z  
Activity: Initial triage Department: ER  
(45 M, triage_code=3)

• Event 7 – 08:15:42Z  
Activity: X-ray imaging Department: Radiology  
(45 M, body_part=left_leg)

• Event 12 – 08:23:10Z  
Activity: Doctor consultation Department: ER  
(45 M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)

• Event 15 – 08:30:05Z  
Activity: Patient discharged Department: ER  
(45 M, followup=outpatient_clinic)

  
Case 2 – 62-year-old Female (ER pathway)

• Event 2 – 08:07:02Z  
Activity: Register patient Department: ER  
(62 F, insurance=public)

• Event 5 – 08:12:29Z  
Activity: Initial triage Department: ER  
(62 F, triage_code=2)

• Event 8 – 08:16:10Z  
Activity: Lab test requested Department: ER  
(62 F, test_type=blood_panel)

• Event 10 – 08:20:27Z  
Activity: Lab test completed Department: Laboratory  
(62 F, results=normal_levels)

• Event 11 – 08:22:54Z  
Activity: Doctor consultation Department: ER  
(62 F, diagnosis=minor_infection)

• Event 14 – 08:27:00Z  
Activity: Prescription created Department: ER  
(62 F, medication=antibiotics)

• Event 17 – 08:35:29Z  
Activity: Patient discharged Department: ER  
(62 F, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

  
Case 3 – 28-year-old Male (Surgery pathway)

• Event 3 – 08:07:15Z  
Activity: Register patient Department: Surgery  
(28 M, insurance=private)

• Event 6 – 08:13:00Z  
Activity: Doctor consultation Department: Surgery  
(28 M, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)

• Event 9 – 08:16:45Z  
Activity: Surgery preparation Department: Surgery  
(28 M, prep_type=general_anesthesia)

• Event 13 – 08:25:19Z  
Activity: Surgery performed Department: Surgery  
(28 M, procedure=arthroscopy)

• Event 16 – 08:31:37Z  
Activity: Recovery room Department: Surgery  
(28 M, condition=stable)

• Event 18 – 08:40:13Z  
Activity: Patient discharged Department: Surgery  
(28 M, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

  

Explanation of the groupings:

1. The 45-year-old male’s events all originate in the ER timeline—with registration, triage, radiology imaging, a subsequent ER doctor consultation diagnosing a hairline fracture, and ending with discharge from the ER.

2. The 62-year-old female’s sequence shows an ER registration, triage, lab-ordered tests (with results and a later consultation diagnosing a minor infection), prescription creation, and eventual discharge—all aligning to one ER path.

3. The 28-year-old male case is distinct by being routed to Surgery. From his registration in the surgery department, he experiences a surgery-related consultation, preparation, the actual surgery procedure, a recovery stage, and discharge with physiotherapy followup.

Thus, the interleaved events belong to three distinct cases based on the logical flows and patient attributes.
