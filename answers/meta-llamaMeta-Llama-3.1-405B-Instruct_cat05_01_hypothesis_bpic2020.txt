Based on the provided process variants, I've generated a list of 20 relevant questions with a confidence score for each question. The confidence score is a subjective assessment of how relevant and insightful the answer to the question is likely to be, based on the provided data. Please find the list below:

**1. What is the most common sequence of activities in the process?** (Confidence score: 9/10)
**2. Which user role (e.g., EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR) is most frequently involved in the process?** (Confidence score: 8.5/10)
**3. What percentage of declarations are approved by ADMINISTRATION in the first attempt?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
**4. Which activity has the highest average performance time (i.e., duration)?** (Confidence score: 9/10)
**5. What is the average number of iterations (i.e., loops) in the process?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
**6. Which declaration status (e.g., APPROVED, REJECTED, FINAL_APPROVED) is most frequently reached in the process?** (Confidence score: 8.5/10)
**7. How often do declarations get rejected by ADMINISTRATION before being approved?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
**8. What is the most common reason for declarations being rejected by SUPERVISOR?** (Confidence score: 7.5/10)
**9. Can we identify any differences in process behavior depending on the time of day/week/month?** (Confidence score: 7/10)
**10. Which user role is most frequently responsible for the longest performance times?** (Confidence score: 8.5/10)
**11. What is the probability that a declaration will be finally approved after being rejected by ADMINISTRATION?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
**12. How does the performance time of the process vary depending on the declaration type?** (Confidence score: 7.5/10)
**13. Are there any specific combinations of user roles and activities that are more likely to lead to rejections?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
**14. Can we identify any correlations between performance time and declaration status?** (Confidence score: 7.5/10)
**15. How does the process behavior change depending on the experience (
