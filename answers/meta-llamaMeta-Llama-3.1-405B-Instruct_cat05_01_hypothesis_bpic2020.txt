Based on the provided process variants, I've generated a list of 20 relevant questions with a confidence score for each question. The confidence score represents the likelihood that the question is relevant to the process, with higher scores indicating greater relevance.

**Note:** The confidence scores are subjective and based on my analysis of the process variants.

1. **What is the most common sequence of activities in the process?** (Confidence score: 9/10)
2. **What is the average processing time for a declaration?** (Confidence score: 8.5/10)
3. **Which activity is most likely to be rejected?** (Confidence score: 8.5/10)
4. **What is the probability of a declaration being approved by the administration?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
5. **How often does a declaration need to be resubmitted?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
6. **What is the typical sequence of activities for a declaration that is rejected by the administration?** (Confidence score: 7.5/10)
7. **How does the process change when a declaration is rejected by the supervisor?** (Confidence score: 7.5/10)
8. **What is the average number of times a declaration is reviewed by the administration?** (Confidence score: 7/10)
9. **Which activity has the highest processing time?** (Confidence score: 7/10)
10. **Can a declaration be approved by the budget owner without being approved by the administration?** (Confidence score: 6.5/10)
11. **How often does a declaration need to be approved by the pre-approver?** (Confidence score: 6.5/10)
12. **What is the probability of a declaration being rejected by the pre-approver?** (Confidence score: 6/10)
13. **Can a declaration be rejected by the supervisor after being approved by the administration?** (Confidence score: 6/10)
14. **How does the process change when a declaration is saved by the employee?** (Confidence score: 5.5/10)
15. **What is the average processing time for a declaration that is approved by the administration and the budget owner?** (Confidence score: 5.5/10)
16. **Can a declaration be approved by the supervisor without being approved by the administration?** (Confidence score: 5/10)
17. **How often does a declaration need to be reviewed by the budget owner?** (Confidence score: 5/10)
18. **What is the probability of a declaration being rejected by the budget owner?** (Confidence score: 4.5/10)
19. **Can a declaration be rejected by the administration after being approved by the pre-approver?** (Confidence score: 4.5/10)
20. **How does the process change when a declaration is rejected by the missing activity?** (Confidence score: 4/10)

These questions cover various aspects of the process, including sequence of activities, processing times, rejection probabilities, and approval requirements. The confidence scores reflect the relevance of each question to the process, with higher scores indicating greater relevance.
