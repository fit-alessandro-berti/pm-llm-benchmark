The given data represents a process for approving and rejecting employee expense declarations. Each line in the data describes a single declaration submitted by an employee. The process involves multiple stages where the declaration is reviewed by various levels of management before being approved or rejected for payment. 

The process starts with the declaration submitted by an employee, which then moves to the administration level for approval. If approved, it then moves to the budget owner level, followed by a final review by the supervisor. At each stage, the declaration can be either approved or rejected. 

In addition, the data also shows that declarations may be submitted multiple times if they are initially rejected and later resubmitted with changes. This can happen for various reasons such as missing information or incomplete documentation. The resubmission process can involve additional stages of review before being finally approved or rejected. 

The data also includes information on the frequency and performance metrics of the approval process. The 'frequency' parameter indicates the number of declarations approved during a given time period, while the 'performance' parameter measures how efficiently the approvers are in processing these declarations. A higher 'performance' value generally indicates faster turnaround times for declaration approvals.
