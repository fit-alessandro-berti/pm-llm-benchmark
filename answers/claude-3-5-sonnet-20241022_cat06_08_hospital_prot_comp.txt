Analyzing the process variants between the protected and unprotected groups, I can identify several key differences that might indicate unfair treatment:

1. Complexity of Care:
- The unprotected group more frequently undergoes more complex treatment paths, with longer sequences involving "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination" as initial steps
- The most frequent variants for the unprotected group include both Expert and Thorough examinations, while the protected group's most common variants are simpler paths with just basic Examination

2. Treatment Success Rates:
- The protected group has more variants ending without "Treatment successful" or with early termination
- There are more incomplete process variants in the protected group (like variants ending at "Register at ER" or "Register at FD")

3. Multiple Treatment Attempts:
- The unprotected group shows more instances of multiple treatment attempts (sequences with "Treatment unsuccessful" followed by additional treatments)
- The unprotected group has longer process variants involving up to three treatment attempts, which might indicate more persistent care

4. Initial Point of Contact:
- The protected group has a more even distribution between "Register at ER" and "Register at FD"
- The unprotected group seems to have more planned visits (more FD registrations for complex examinations)

These differences might suggest:
- Less thorough initial assessment for the protected group
- Earlier termination of treatment for the protected group
- Less persistence in treating protected group members when initial treatments are unsuccessful
- Different standards of care between the two groups

This could indicate systematic bias in healthcare delivery, though further investigation would be needed to confirm these patterns and their causes.
