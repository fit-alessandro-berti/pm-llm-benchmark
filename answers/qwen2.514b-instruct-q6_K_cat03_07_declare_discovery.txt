To create a DECLARE model based on the provided variants, we need to identify patterns and constraints that are consistent across these variants. Below is an example of how you might structure your DECLARE model as a Python dictionary using the pm4py framework. I'll focus primarily on existence, precedence (since it's the most common pattern in this process), co-existence, and non-succession based on the provided data.

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                  'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                  'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                  'Add penalty': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'exactly_one': {},
    'absence': {},
    'init': {'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'responded_existence': {},
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {},
    'precedence': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'succession': {},
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {},
    'chainprecedence': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'chainsuccession': {},
    'noncoexistence': {},
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Add penalty'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'nonchainsuccession': {}
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Existence**: Indicates that certain activities must occur at least once in any trace (e.g., `Create Fine`, `Send Fine`, `Insert Fine Notification`, and `Add penalty`).
- **Exactly One**: Not directly relevant based on the provided data; left empty.
- **Absence**: No activity is specified to be absent, so this is left empty.
- **Initialization**: The process always starts with `Create Fine`.
- **Precedence**:
  - A `Send Fine` should precede an `Insert Fine Notification`
  - An `Insert Fine Notification` should precede an `Add penalty`
- **Chain Precedence**: Similar to precedence but specifies a direct sequence without any intervening activities.
- **Non-Succession and Non-Chain Succession**:
  - A `Send Fine` is not directly followed by a `Payment`.
  - An `Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture` does not immediately precede an `Add penalty`.

### Notes:
1. The above model is simplified for clarity, focusing on primary patterns observed from the provided process variants.
2. You might need to refine this model further based on specific business rules and additional data analysis.
3. Some activities in your list like `Payment`, `Appeal to Judge`, etc., occur less frequently or under different conditions (e.g., after certain appeals), which are not covered by basic precedence or succession but would require more detailed modeling if critical.

This model can be used as a starting point for further refinement and inclusion of additional constraints based on your specific requirements.
