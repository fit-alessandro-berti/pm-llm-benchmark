Below is a plainlanguage walkthrough of the process, what each step does, what the gateways mean, how paths merge or loop, and how the flow differs for standard versus custom requests. I also call out when approvals and rework get triggered.

Overall intent
- Handle a customer’s request from intake to confirmation, with different processing for standard versus custom work, necessary checks (credit, inventory, feasibility), optional approval, and either an early rejection (if custom isn’t feasible) or a confirmed invoice and customer notification.

Meaning of gateways in this model
- XOR gateway (exclusive): routes the flow down exactly one path based on business rules (e.g., request type, feasibility, approval decision). When used to merge alternative branches, it simply passes through the token that arrives (because only one branch is active).
- AND gateway (parallel): splits work into multiple tasks that proceed at the same time. The corresponding parallel join waits for all parallel tasks to finish before continuing.

Step-by-step explanation with purpose of each step
1) Start Event: The process begins when a customer request is received.

2) Task A – Receive Customer Request
- Purpose: Capture the incoming request, create a case/order record, and collect basic information (customer identity, items/services requested, quantities, dates, special requirements).

3) XOR – Check Request Type
- Decision: Is the request a standard offering or a custom request?
- Only one path proceeds: Standard path or Custom path.

Standard path
4) Task B1 – Perform Standard Validation
- Purpose: Confirm the request is for a catalog/standard item and that the request is complete and valid (correct SKUs, quantities, addresses, contract references, etc.).

5) AND – Run Parallel Checks
- Split into two parallel tasks to shorten lead time:
  - Task C1 – Credit Check
    - Purpose: Assess the customer’s credit status/limits, account standing, and risk flags.
  - Task C2 – Inventory Check
    - Purpose: Verify stock availability, allocation options, or backorder needs.
- AND join – waits for both checks to complete.

6) Task D – Calculate Delivery Date
- Purpose: Based on inventory status, lead times, shipping options, and any credit-related constraints (e.g., prepayment), compute a realistic delivery/fulfillment date and any related conditions.

Custom path
4) Task B2 – Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis
- Purpose: Evaluate whether the requested customization can be delivered within technical, capacity, cost, compliance, and time constraints. May involve engineering, procurement, production planning, and costing.

5) XOR – Is Customization Feasible?
- If Yes: proceed to Task E1.
- If No: proceed to Task E2 and terminate the process.

6) Task E1 – Prepare Custom Quotation
- Purpose: Prepare a detailed custom quote including scope/specification, price, delivery lead time, assumptions, and terms.

7) Task E2 – Send Rejection Notice (if not feasible)
- Purpose: Inform the customer that the request cannot be met, optionally suggest alternatives.
- End Event: The process ends here for infeasible custom requests.

Paths converge and approval decision
8) Merge point after Standard or Custom work
- From Standard: after Task D; from Custom: after Task E1.
- Since only one of these paths is active, this is an exclusive merge (no waiting for anything else).

9) XOR – Is Approval Needed?
- Decision based on business rules (see “When approvals are needed” below).
- If Yes: go to Task F.
- If No: skip to Task G.

Approval and potential rework
10) Task F – Obtain Manager Approval
- Purpose: Route the case with all supporting data (price, cost/margin, risk flags, delivery feasibility) to the designated approver(s).

11) XOR – Is Approval Granted?
- If Yes: proceed to Task G.
- If No: proceed to Task H.

12) Task H – Re-evaluate Conditions
- Purpose: Address the approver’s concerns. This is a rework loop:
  - For Custom requests: loop back to Task E1 (revise the custom quotation—scope, price, lead time, terms).
  - For Standard requests: loop back to Task D (recalculate delivery date or related conditions, possibly after adjusting allocation, shipping method, or pricing inputs).
- After rework, the flow returns through the approval decision again (i.e., back to “Is Approval Needed?” or directly to approval depending on how you implement the loop). In the diagram, the loop explicitly targets E1 or D, after which it reaches the approval gateway again.

Finalization and confirmation
13) Task G – Generate Final Invoice
- Purpose: Create the final invoice (or order confirmation/offer, depending on your terminology) reflecting the approved or automatically accepted terms.

14) Task I – Send Confirmation to Customer
- Purpose: Communicate the finalized details (invoice, delivery commitment, terms) to the customer, and optionally trigger downstream fulfillment.

15) End Event: The process completes once confirmation is sent.

How the two main paths differ
- Standard request:
  - Focus on catalog items and policy-driven checks.
  - Parallelized credit and inventory checks speed up processing.
  - Delivery date calculation is the key output before approval/invoice.
  - Rework, if needed after an approval denial, centers on adjusting delivery commitments or related conditions.
- Custom request:
  - Requires feasibility analysis before pricing.
  - If not feasible, the process ends early with a rejection.
  - If feasible, a tailored quotation is prepared.
  - Rework, if needed after an approval denial, centers on revising scope, pricing, or lead time to meet margin, risk, or policy constraints.

When approvals are needed (typical rules)
- Approval may be required when any of the following is true:
  - Order value or discount exceeds thresholds.
  - Margin falls below policy.
  - Customer credit status is borderline or negative.
  - Rush/expedited or nonstandard terms are requested.
  - Inventory is insufficient and backordering or substitutions are required.
  - Any custom work is involved (often default to “approval required”).
- If none of the rules trigger approval, the process generates the invoice directly.

When rework is triggered
- Rework occurs only if an approver denies the request at “Is Approval Granted?”.
  - Standard: rework delivery commitments or conditions (Task D).
  - Custom: rework the quote and possibly the design/assumptions (Task E1).
- The loop continues until approval is granted or the business chooses to cancel the request (a cancel path is not shown in the pseudo-BPMN but can be added).

How paths converge or end
- Parallel checks (credit and inventory) use an AND split and AND join; the flow resumes only when both finish.
- Standard and Custom paths converge exclusively before the approval decision (only one is active).
- Custom infeasible path exits early at a dedicated End Event after sending a rejection.
- The final confirmation leads to the main End Event for successful cases.

Notes on modeling clarity (optional)
- The exclusive merge after “Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed” can be modeled as a simple sequence flow in BPMN because only one path can reach it at a time; an explicit XOR merge is acceptable for readability.
- Ensure the rework loop preserves context so the process “knows” whether to return to E1 (custom) or D (standard). This is typically implemented by a stored request-type attribute.
