1. How does the R&D team’s early design choices influence downstream supplier selection, lead times, and overall supply chain resilience?  
2. In what ways could geopolitical tensions or trade policy changes among Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the United States disrupt component availability, and how might the company proactively mitigate those risks?  
3. What strategies can be employed to balance just-in-time inventory approaches for high-demand markets with cost-effective bulk shipments for slower-moving regions without compromising customer satisfaction?  
4. How might the integration of real-time IoT sensor data on assembly line machinery better predict equipment failures and reduce unplanned downtime in the Malaysian plant?  
5. Which key performance indicators (KPIs) provide the most meaningful insight into end-to-end supply chain efficiency, and how should they be prioritized or weighted?  
6. How can machine learning models be trained to improve demand forecasting accuracy when faced with volatile consumer preferences and rapid product lifecycles?  
7. What are the potential ethical and environmental implications of sourcing critical materials—such as rare earth elements—and how could alternative suppliers or materials reduce those impacts?  
8. How does currency fluctuation among multiple countries affect component pricing and overall product margin, and what financial hedging strategies could be employed to manage this exposure?  
9. In what ways can collaboration platforms or blockchain technology enhance transparency, traceability, and trust among international suppliers, logistics partners, and regulatory authorities?  
10. How might a sudden global event (e.g., a pandemic, natural disaster, or cyberattack) stress-test each supply chain node, and what contingency plans should be in place for rapid recovery?  
11. What role could additive manufacturing (3-D printing) play in decentralizing the production of certain smartphone components, and how might this change supplier relationships and cost structures?  
12. How can the company ensure consistent quality assurance standards across suppliers operating under different regulatory regimes and cultural norms?  
13. What incentives or contractual mechanisms can be introduced to encourage suppliers and logistics partners to adopt greener practices and reduce overall carbon footprint?  
14. How can the company streamline customs clearance processes to reduce transit times without increasing compliance risks in diverse regulatory environments?  
15. In what ways can after-sales support data—such as warranty claims and repair logs—feed back into design and manufacturing decisions to improve future product reliability?  
16. How might the company balance data privacy requirements (e.g., GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California) with the need for granular supply chain analytics across global regions?  
17. What workforce development initiatives are necessary to upskill employees in the Malaysian assembly plant as automation and AI tools become more prevalent?  
18. How can scenario planning help the company decide when to hold strategic safety stock versus investing in dual sourcing for critical components?  
19. What mechanisms can be deployed to quickly detect and respond to counterfeit or substandard components entering the supply chain?  
20. How could customer feedback from VIP or pre-order channels be leveraged to refine product launch strategies and align supply chain capacity with anticipated demand peaks?
