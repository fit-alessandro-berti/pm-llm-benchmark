1. How might geopolitical tensions or trade restrictions in any supplier’s country disrupt component availability, and what contingency plans could mitigate such risks?  
2. In what ways can collaborative forecasting with suppliers and logistics partners improve leadtime accuracy and reduce safetystock levels across the network?  
3. How could the firm redesign its supplier portfolio to balance cost advantages with resilience, sustainability, and ethical sourcing principles?  
4. What predictive analytics or machinelearning models could best anticipate sudden demand spikes for flagship devices without inflating inventory?  
5. How might carbonemission targets influence decisions on transportation modes—air versus sea—and what tradeoffs arise between speed, cost, and sustainability?  
6. Which qualityassurance checkpoints along the supply chain most effectively catch defects early, and how could feedback loops be shortened to prevent largescale recalls?  
7. How can realtime visibility across multiple time zones be improved so that planners, suppliers, and logistics partners make synchronized decisions?  
8. What alternative manufacturing strategies—such as regionalized “microfactories” or contract manufacturing—could reduce dependency on a single assembly plant in Malaysia?  
9. How might fluctuating exchange rates and multicurrency transactions impact overall supplychain profitability, and what financial hedging strategies could be employed?  
10. In what ways can automation and robotics on the assembly line be scaled without compromising workforce engagement, safety, and local labor compliance?  
11. How can the company incorporate circulareconomy principles—like repairability, refurbished devices, and component recycling—into its endtoend supply chain?  
12. What datagovernance policies are needed to ensure that sensitive supplier and customer information remains secure while still enabling broad data sharing for analytics?  
13. How could vendormanaged inventory (VMI) or consignment stock models alter the power dynamics and risk allocation between the firm and its key component suppliers?  
14. Which metrics beyond traditional cost and lead time—such as social impact, supplier diversity, or environmental footprint—should be elevated in supplier scorecards?  
15. How might emerging trade blocs or new freetrade agreements reshape optimal distributioncenter locations over the next decade?  
16. What earlywarning indicators can be monitored to detect capacity constraints in the semiconductor ecosystem before they cascade into production delays?  
17. How can aftersales service data (e.g., warranty claims, repair rates) be fed back into R&D and supplier negotiations to drive continuous product and process improvements?  
18. In managing justintime replenishment for highdemand markets, how can the firm protect itself against the bullwhip effect amplified by volatile consumer preferences?  
19. What ethical considerations arise when balancing cost pressures with fair labor practices across different regions, and how should the company audit and enforce compliance?  
20. How could blockchain or other distributedledger technologies enhance traceability from raw materials to end customer, and what obstacles might hinder largescale adoption?
