The process model you provided appears to describe a workflow or process involving the submission, approval, and handling of a request for payment. Here's a high-level description of the process based on the constraints provided:

1. **Initialization**: The process starts with the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" activity. This is the initial step where an employee submits a declaration.

2. **Approval**: The "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" activity leads to the "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" activity, indicating that the supervisor needs to review the declaration. There is a constraint that the "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" activity must occur after the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" activity.

3. **Approval by Supervisor**: The "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" activity leads to the "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" activity, indicating that the supervisor has approved the declaration. This constraint specifies that the "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" activity must occur after the "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" activity.

4. **Handling of Payment**: The "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" activity leads to the "Payment Handled" activity, indicating that the payment is being handled. This constraint specifies that the "Payment Handled" activity must occur after the "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" activity.

5. **Succession**: There are constraints specifying that the "Payment Handled" activity must occur after the "Request Payment" activity, indicating a direct flow from the request to the payment handling. This is an example of the "Succession" constraint.

6. **Multi-Step Approvals**: There are constraints specifying that the "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" activity must occur after the "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" activity, and the "Payment Handled" activity must occur after the "Request Payment" activity. This shows that there are multiple approval steps involved in the process.

7. **Non-Co-Existence**: There are constraints specifying that certain activities cannot occur together, such as "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" and "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurring at the same time.

8. **Non-Sequence and Non-Chain Succession**: There are constraints specifying that certain activities cannot follow or be followed by other activities, such as "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" not being followed by "Request Payment", and "Payment Handled" not being followed by "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".

Overall, this process model describes a workflow where an employee submits a declaration, it is reviewed and approved by a supervisor, and then the payment is handled. The process is structured with clear approvals and handling steps, with constraints to ensure that the process follows specific steps in a logical order.
