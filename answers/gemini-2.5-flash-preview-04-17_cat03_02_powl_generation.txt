from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Define all activity nodes (Transitions)
sr = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")
cs = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
da = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
aci = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
bnc = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
dr = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
cd = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
md = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
qa = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
sa = Transition(label="Security Audit")
gla = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# 2. Define operator nodes for loop and choice
# The loop is between BNC and D&R. The definition of LOOP(A, B) is "execute A, then either exit, or execute B and then A again".
# So, BNC is A, and D&R is B.
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[bnc, dr])

# The choice is between CD and MD.
xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cd, md])

# 3. Define the root StrictPartialOrder.
# The nodes of the root PO are the main sequential/concurrent entities.
# These include the initial sequential activities, the concurrent activities group (represented as individual nodes here, dependencies establish concurrency),
# the operator nodes (loop, choice), and the final sequential/concurrent activities group and final step.
root_nodes = [sr, cs, da, aci, loop_node, xor_node, qa, sa, gla]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=root_nodes)

# 4. Define the partial order dependencies based on the scenario
# - SR must complete before CS
root.order.add_edge(sr, cs)

# - After CS, DA and ACI can be done concurrently
root.order.add_edge(cs, da)
root.order.add_edge(cs, aci)

# - The loop (represented by loop_node) must wait for both DA and ACI to complete
root.order.add_edge(da, loop_node)
root.order.add_edge(aci, loop_node)

# - After the loop completes, the choice (represented by xor_node) begins
root.order.add_edge(loop_node, xor_node)

# - After the choice completes, QA and SA can be done concurrently
root.order.add_edge(xor_node, qa)
root.order.add_edge(xor_node, sa)

# - GLA must wait for both QA and SA to complete
root.order.add_edge(qa, gla)
root.order.add_edge(sa, gla)

# The 'root' object now represents the complete POWL model for the scenario.
# You can potentially visualize or further process this object using other pm4py functions.
# For example, you could print its structure or check its validity if pm4py provides such functions for POWL.

# Optional: Print a confirmation or a simple representation (depends on POWL object's __str__ or __repr__)
print("POWL model constructed successfully.")
# Note: pm4py's POWL object might not have a comprehensive string representation by default.
# You would typically use visualization functions if available in pm4py for POWL.
# print(root) # This might not output a readable graph representation directly
