### **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

#### **Defining "Waiting Time"**
In this outpatient clinic context, *waiting time* for a patient is the duration between the completion of one activity (or arrival at a stage) and the start of the next required activity. For example, if a patient finishes registration at 09:08:45 and begins the nurse assessment only at 09:15:20, the waiting time for nurse assessment is 6 minutes and 35 seconds. Conceptually:

**Waiting Time (Active Queue) = Activity N Start Timestamp  Activity N-1 Completion Timestamp**

For the first activity (e.g., Registration) in a visit, the waiting time is often implicitly, or explicitly, the difference between the patient’s arrival (if recorded) or check-in time, and the activity start time. If the concept of “arrival at clinic” is tracked, waiting time for registration is calculated similarly.

#### **Key Metrics for Characterizing Queues**
To quantify and prioritize the queues, we should calculate several statistics:

- **Average Waiting Time per Activity Transition**: Calculated for all patients across a time frame, representing the typical duration spent in a queue for a specific transition (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment).
- **Median Waiting Time**: Less sensitive to extreme outliers and more representative of the typical patient experience.
- **Maximum Waiting Time, 90th Percentile Waiting Time**: Helps identify outliers and extreme delays, essential for improving the worst-case experience.
- **Queue Frequency**: Represents how often patients encounter the queue—a high-frequency, moderately long queue might harm more patients than a rare, very long wait.
- **Cases Experiencing “Excessive” Waits**: Thresholds (e.g., waits > 30 minutes, or 90th percentile duration) can be defined based on service level agreements or patient satisfaction targets.

#### **Identifying Critical Queues**
The *most critical* queues should be identified based on a *weighted combination of metrics* and clinical/operational context. Criteria include:
- **Longest Average/High Percentile Waits**: Queues where patients frequently wait much longer than acceptable.
- **Highest Frequency**: Queues encountered by nearly all patients; even small improvements can multiply across all visits.
- **Impact on Specific Patient Types or Urgency Levels**: For instance, if “Urgent” patient class experiences disproportionate delays at a particular stage (e.g., between nurse assessment and doctor consult), these must be prioritized.
- **Downstream Impact**: If delays in a queue (e.g., from Nurse Assessment to Doctor Consult) extend the whole visit or delay important diagnostic steps, they are especially critical.

**Justification**: Combining metrics ensures that optimization is patient-centered, maximizes reach, and addresses both chronic and acute bottlenecks.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis**

To move from “where” to “why” queues form, the following factors (and corresponding process mining techniques) should be considered using the event log:

- **Resource Bottlenecks**:
  - If a resource (room, staff, equipment) is consistently busy or unaligned with demand, queuing will increase. Process mining can track:
    - **Resource utilization rates**: How busy each staff member or room is at any given time.
    - **Handover delays**: Delays transferring patients between resources (e.g., nurse to doctor).
    - **Occupancy graphs**: Visualize when specific rooms or staff are at capacity.
- **Activity Dependencies and Handovers**:
  - Sequential activities where the previous step routinely takes longer than allotted time. For example, if all patients must pass through nurse assessment before seeing a doctor, congestion in nurse assessment creates a knock-on queue for doctors.
  - This can be visualized with **process variant analysis**—comparing average times and bottlenecks for patients following different care paths.
- **Variability in Activity Durations**:
  - Patient heterogeneity (e.g., complex cases taking longer for ECG) causes queues if service times vary widely. **Service time distributions** (mean, variance) for each activity identify high-variability problems.
- **Appointment Scheduling Policies**:
  - If scheduled appointment slots are too tight or not staggered for different specialties (e.g., bunching all cardiology consults at 10 AM), uneven demand will cause predictable bottlenecks. **Temporal trend analysis** (tracking queue sizes/times by hour/day) reveals scheduling misalignment.
- **Patient Arrival Patterns**:
  - If many patients arrive at clinic check-in at once—outside staff capacity—registration queues surge. **Arrival histograms** show if arrivals cluster at certain times, indicating the need for staggered check-in or larger opening staff teams.
- **Differences by Patient Type (New vs. Follow-up) or Urgency**:
  - New patients may take longer at each step (more information gathering) than follow-ups, but clinics may not account for this in scheduling. Urgent patients should move faster but might not be prioritized properly. **Stratifying waiting times** by patient characteristics reveals these disparities.

**Techniques for root cause pinpointing**:
- **Tracking and Tracing**: Identify instances where long waits occurred and trace through the preceding and following step.
- **Network and Petri Net analysis**: Model the sequence and dependencies to highlight bottlenecks.
- **Predictive modeling**: Of wait times based on historical patterns, to reveal which factors best correlate with delays.

### **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Below are **three distinct, actionable strategies** to reduce critical waiting times, each targeting major bottlenecks and supported by data analysis.

---

#### **Strategy 1: Reschedule and Roster Staff for Peak Times**
- **Targeted Queue**: The queue from Registration  Nurse Assessment, based on data showing that nurse wait times spike at certain hours.
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Uneven utilization and peak hour congestion, causing patients to bottleneck before nurse assessment.
- **Data & Analysis Justification**: Temporal trends of nurse utilizations and queue lengths highlight predictable peaks. If nurses are consistently at >90% utilization between 9 AM and 10:30 AM, small additional staff presence (or staggered shifts) could flatten demand.
- **Action**: Stagger nurse shifts to have coverage begin before and extend slightly beyond the peak; or bring in an extra nurse during the busiest 1.5 hours.
- **Expected Impact**: If nurse capacity can be raised to match peak demand, average waits between registration and nurse assessment *could be reduced by 40–50%* during the busiest slot, benefiting hundreds of patients weekly.

---

#### **Strategy 2: Parallelize and Streamline Patient Handover**
- **Targeted Queue**: Queue from Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (perceived bottleneck, as doctor time is precious and often fully utilized).
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Strictly sequential flow forces all patients to wait for the doctor one-by-one. Any nurse assessment variation causes downstream GP backlog.
- **Data & Analysis Justification**: Process variant analysis shows that, for patients who need specialized tests (e.g., ECG) after nurse assessment, delays mount if these tests aren't immediately available. If some patients can visit testing before (or in parallel with) waiting for doctor review, queues shrink.
- **Action**: Re-design process so that, when possible and ordered by nurse, test setup (e.g., ECG) can start *before* the doctor. Use staff coordination and slotting to reduce idle test equipment time.
- **Expected Impact**: Patients whose care can leverage parallel resources see their overall visit times drop by an average of 20–30 minutes as they avoid sequential delays; doctor backlog eases.

---

#### **Strategy 3: Differentiate Appointment Slots by Patient Type**
- **Targeted Queue**: Queue into specialist consultations (e.g., for “positive” test results or urgent cases), often seen for follow-up and urgent patients.
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Blunt appointment scheduling doesn't differentiate between new, long follow-up, and urgent patients, leading to queue polarization. Urgent and complex follow-up cases might block slots better fit for simpler visits.
- **Data & Analysis Justification**: Stratified timing and queue statistics show urgent and complex cases linger in queues much longer than routine ones. Tighter scheduling isn’t sustainable; priority-based slots are needed.
- **Action**: Implement urgent/special slots reserved for high-priority cases. Assign a portion of morning slots to urgent consults; middle-of-day slots to routine follow-ups; designate end-of-day for longer new cases. Train front-desk to prioritize routing patients to appropriate slots.
- **Expected Impact**: The median waiting time for urgent patients waiting for a doctor drops from ~45 mins to ~15 mins; patients perceive more fairness, and doctor schedule utilization becomes more balanced.

### **4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

Each optimization strategy carries potential unintended consequences that must be actively managed:

- **Rescheduling Staff**:
  - **Trade-off**: May increase costs due to overtime or additional part-time staff.
  - **Mitigation**: Model and compare the cost of patient dissatisfaction (e.g., lost future visits, negative reviews) versus the expense of additional staff, focus on most cost-effective solutions.
- **Parallelizing Handovers**:
  - **Trade-off**: Requires close staff coordination and additional initial setup time, possibly straining resource availability.
  - **Mitigation**: Phase introduction, pilot with a single specialty, monitor cost of re-training vs. benefits.
- **Differentiated Scheduling**:
  - **Trade-off**: If strict, may reduce flexibility, causing staff stress; “urgent” can be gamed by patients.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement a straightforward triage system for urgency to keep systemic transparency and fairness.

Balancing cost control with patient satisfaction means:
- Starting with low-risk pilot projects.
- Measuring both financial (staff hours, overtime) and non-financial (patient satisfaction scores, NPS) KPIs.
- Regularly reviewing allocation with staff and patients for transparency and continuous improvement.

### **5. Measuring Success**

**KPIs for Evaluation Post-Implementation**:

- **Operational**:
  - **Average Waiting Time (by Stage)**: Overall and per patient type (New/Follow-up, etc.), showing progression at critical points (e.g., registration  nurse, nurse  doctor).
  - **Percentage of Patients Waiting > X (Threshold) Minutes**: e.g., Those waiting >30 mins for specialist consult or nurse review, indicating high bottlenecks.
  - **Throughput Metrics**: Visits per hour or day for each resource, staff, and stage.
  - **Resource Utilization Ratios**: Idle vs. Busy time by staff/equipment—target 75–85% utilization for efficiency without burnout.

- **Patient Experience**:
  - **Patient Satisfaction Scores**: Direct surveys capturing perceived wait times and smoothness.
  - **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Tracking if recommendations improve.

- **Continuous Monitoring**:
  - Use refined process mining models to periodically reapply queue and bottleneck analyses.
  - Trigger alerts when queues or waits exceed service-level thresholds.
  - Escalate anomalies for root cause analysis (operational dashboards, trends visualized weekly/monthly).

By aligning improvements with ongoing monitoring, clinics sustain progress toward efficient, patient-centered throughput without unnecessary cost burdens.
