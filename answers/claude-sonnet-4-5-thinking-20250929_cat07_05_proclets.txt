# Visualization Description

This is a technical diagram illustrating a **Proclet system** for medical laboratory testing workflow, consisting of three related parts:

## (a) Main Process Flow Diagram
A complex workflow showing two interconnected proclet classes ("Lab visit" and "Lab test") communicating through channels:

**Left side (Lab visit process):**
- Starts with doctor and assistant roles
- Includes steps: Order entry  blood sample collection  Receive result  Judge results
- Contains a decision loop for retesting if needed ("Do tests again")
- Ends with "Send report"
- Connected to an "Order system" and "HIS" (Hospital Information System)

**Right side (Lab test process):**
- Involves chemical analyst role
- Main steps: Perform test  Make report  Finish lab test
- Parallel path for updated reports when retesting occurs
- Multiple endpoints shown as filled circles

The processes communicate through numbered channels (1:1, 1:*) showing the cardinality of interactions between activities.

## (b) Class Diagram
Shows the relationship between two classes:
- **Lab visit** (1:1) requires **Lab test** (1:*)
- Indicates one lab visit can require multiple lab tests

## (c) Performative Example
A table demonstrating message-passing at 11:00, where the Order system sends a creation request from "Lab visit-John" to "Lab test-HGB John" requesting an HGB test, marked as private outgoing communication.
