**Assumptions:**

*   `Resource/Actor`:  Assumed to be the person responsible for each event. The data provided had resource IDs, and I associated them with role, however, it wasn't explicitly tied to a specific event. Therefore, I populated with the resource name to show who likely performed the action.
*   `Other Attributes`: I have added additional attributes such as `item_id` or `payment_method` where relevant.
*   Order Arrived: The timestamp for "Order Arrived" is taken as the timestamp of the delivery.
