Based on the given declarative constraints and data, the process can be described as follows:

1. An employee submits a declaration which is then forwarded for approval to the Administration.
2. The Administration can either reject the declaration (in which case the process ends), approve it and forward it to the Budget Owner and Supervisor for approval, or forward it to the Pre-Approver for further review.
3. If the declaration is forwarded to the Pre-Approver, they can either approve it (in which case it goes back to the Administration) or reject it (in which case it goes back to the employee with a reason for rejection).
4. If the Administration approves the declaration, it goes to the Budget Owner and Supervisor for approval.
5. The Budget Owner and Supervisor can either approve the declaration (in which case the Supervisor can finalize the approval) or reject it.
6. If the Supervisor finalizes the approval, a request for payment can be made.
7. After the payment request, the payment is handled, which marks the end of the process.
8. If the declaration is rejected at any point, it cannot be resubmitted without modifications.
9. Certain activities cannot co-exist, such as a declaration being approved and rejected at the same time, or a declaration being saved and rejected by the same entity.
10. The number of occurrences for each activity is also bounded, indicating the maximum number of times each activity can occur in a case.
