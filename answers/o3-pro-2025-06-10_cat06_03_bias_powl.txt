Where does the bias come from?

1. How the branch is used  
   • The XOR operator is mutually exclusive: an instance of the process will either traverse D (CheckLocalAffiliation) or take the silent-transition “skip”.  
   • In practical terms the routing condition will be something such as  
        if applicant.is_local_and_in_group():  
            path = D        # do the affiliation check  small score uplift  
        else:  
            path = skip     # go straight on  
   • Everyone who is routed through D can only gain (the branch is designed to uplift the score, not to reduce it).  
   • Anyone who is not routed through D can never obtain that uplift, but can still be rejected later on the usual grounds.

2. Why it is a problem  
   a) Unequal treatment of similarly situated applicants  
      – Two files that are otherwise identical but differ on the “local affiliation” flag leave the loop_data_validation phase with the same information and the same preliminary score C.  
      – One of them is then offered an “extra lottery ticket” (step D); the other is not.  
      – The routing decision therefore makes the procedure path-dependent on a feature that is not related to credit-worthiness in a strict underwriting sense.  
        
   b) Proxy for protected characteristics  
      – Geography and community-membership are often highly correlated with race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Even if “local affiliation” is not itself a legally protected attribute, it can act as a proxy.  
      – A small systematic uplift granted mostly to the majority group will, over thousands of cases, widen approval-rate and pricing gaps (“disparate impact”).  
      – Uplifts are cumulative: a 1–2 % higher approval probability here, plus another seemingly neutral heuristic somewhere else, compounds into materially different outcomes.  

   c) Transparency and contestability  
      – Applicants routed through “skip” never see that there was an additional opportunity to improve their score. They have no way to contest that decision.  
      – From an auditing standpoint this makes compliance checks harder: the event log only shows that some traces contain D; it does not record who was eligible to enter D but did not.  

3. Regulatory / ethical implications  
   • Fair-lending regulation (e.g. ECOA, FHA, EU directives) prohibits practices that “in effect discriminate” even when the rule is facially neutral.  
   • The uplift may breach the 80 % adverse-impact ratio once aggregated by race or national origin.  
   • Intent is irrelevant: Offering an advantage available mainly to members of a non-protected group is treated the same as imposing a disadvantage on a protected group.  

4. Practical consequences for the bank  
   • Higher acceptance and better pricing for the favoured group  revenue leakage, reputation risk, possible class-action litigation.  
   • Model governance frameworks (Basel, SR 11-7, EBA GL/2020/06) require stability, explainability and fairness checks; the XOR branching fails “equal treatment” tests.  
   • Internal and external auditors will demand justification for every divergent path—especially when the path never hurts but only helps.  

5. How to mitigate  
   • Eliminate the XOR and fold “local affiliation” into the normal scoring model, exposing its marginal effect to regular discrimination-testing tools.  
   • Or, if the bank believes local affiliation is a legitimate risk factor, make the rule symmetrical: create an uplift AND a possible down-lift; audit the sign and magnitude.  
   • Run disparate-impact simulations: counter-factual traces where the applicant is toggled between “local” and “not local”.  
   • Log the routing criterion explicitly so it can be inspected in the event log.  
   • Subject every non-core credit feature to a “business necessity / less discriminatory alternative” analysis.  

Summary

The XOR branch creates a two-tier underwriting path in which membership in a non-protected (but demographically skewed) group grants an extra opportunity to raise the score. Over time this “soft” preference translates into a hard disadvantage for everyone else, potentially violating equal-treatment principles and fair-lending law. Removing or redesigning the branch, and rigorously auditing its impact, is essential to preserve fairness and equity in final loan decisions.
