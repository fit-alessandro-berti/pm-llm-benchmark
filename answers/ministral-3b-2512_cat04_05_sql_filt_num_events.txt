Here's a well-structured DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes your task:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)

SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_event_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id;
```

This query:
1. First creates a CTE (`case_event_counts`) that counts events per `case_id` and filters to only include cases with 6 or fewer events
2. Then joins this filtered result back to the original event log to return all events from those qualifying cases

Alternative version if you prefer a single query without CTE:

```sql
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
WHERE
    e.case_id IN (
        SELECT
            case_id
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
        HAVING
            COUNT(*) <= 6
    );
```

Both queries will:
- Exclude any case_id that has more than 6 events
- Return all events from cases that have 6 or fewer events
- Preserve all original event data (including case_id, activity, and timestamp)
