Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out which cases are taking significantly longer. To do that, I should calculate the duration for each case from "Submit Claim" to "Close Claim". 

Looking at the table, each case has multiple entries. Let me list out each case's start and end times to compute their durations.

Starting with Case 2001:
- Submit: 2024-04-01 09:00
- Close: 2024-04-01 10:30
Duration is 1 hour 30 minutes. That's pretty quick.

Case 2002:
- Submit: 2024-04-01 09:05
- Close: 2024-04-02 11:00
Hmm, that's from April 1st to April 2nd. Let's compute the days and hours. From 9:05 to 23:59 on the first day is about 14 hours 54 minutes, plus 11 hours on the second day. Total is around 25.9 hours, so roughly a day and a half? Wait, actually, subtract start time from end time. Let me do it properly:

April 1st 09:05 to April 2nd 11:00 is 26 hours and 55 minutes. So about 26.9 hours.

Case 2003:
Submit: 2024-04-01 09:10
Close: 2024-04-03 09:30
So from April 1 to April 3. Let's compute that:

April 1 start at 9:10, end on April 3rd at 9:30. That's two days and two hours 20 minutes. Total hours: 2*24 + 2.33 = 50.33 hours.

Case 2004:
Submit: 2024-04-01 09:20
Close: 2024-04-01 10:45. That's just 1 hour 25 minutes. Very quick.

Case 2005:
Submit: 2024-04-01 09:25
Close: 2024-04-04 14:30
So starting April 1st and ending April 4th. Let's compute:

From April 1 09:25 to April 4 14:30 is 3 days and 5 hours 5 minutes. Total hours: 77 hours approximately. 

So comparing all cases:

- 2001: ~1.5 hours
- 2002: ~26.9 hours (~1.1 days)
- 2003: ~50.33 hours (~2.1 days)
- 2004: ~1.4 hours
- 2005: ~77 hours (~3.2 days)

Looking at these, cases 2002, 2003, 2005 are taking longer. But how much is "significantly longer"? Let's see the average. The shortest is around 1.5 hours, the next is 26 hours, then 50, then 77. The difference between 2001 and 2002 is a day, so maybe cases that take more than a day are considered problematic. But maybe even 26 hours is over a day. Let's see the process steps. 

Wait, maybe I should consider the process steps and see where the delays are. Let's look at each case's activities.

Case 2001 had no delays except moving quickly through each step. The others probably have delays in certain steps. Let's compute the duration properly for each case:

Wait, actually, let me recalculate the durations precisely. 

Case 2001: Submit at 9:00 AM, Close at 10:30 AM same day. So 1.5 hours. 

Case 2002: Submit 9:05 AM April 1, Close 11:00 AM April 2. That's 24 hours minus 9:05 + 22 hours 55 minutes? Wait, 9:05 to 11:00 next day: from 9:05 to 9:05 next day is 24h, then another 1h55m. So total 25h55m? Wait, maybe better to compute the exact difference.

The difference between April 2nd 11:00 and April 1st 9:05 is (24 - 9.083) + 11.0 (since 9:05 is 9 + 5/60 hours 9.0833). Wait, better to compute in hours:

April 1 9:05 to April 2 11:00 is 25 hours 55 minutes. So 25.92 hours.

Case 2003: submit 9:10, close on April 3 at 9:30 AM. The time from start to end:

April 1 to April 3 is 2 days, 9:30 -9:10 is 20 minutes. So total is 2 days and 20 minutes. That's 48h20m, but wait, let's compute exact:

April 1 9:10 to April 3 9:30 is 48 hours plus 20 minutes. So 48.33 hours.

Case 2005: Submit 9:25 on April 1, closes on April 4 at 14:30. From 9:25 to 14:30 is 3 days and 5 hours 5 minutes. So total:

April 1 9:25 to April 4 14:30 is 3 days minus 1 day (since starting on day 1), so 3 days? Let's compute days and hours:

Days between April 1 to April 4 is 3 days (from 1 to 4 is 3 days). Wait, days between 1st and 4th is 3 days (April 2,3,4? Wait, from 1st to 2nd is 1 day, 1st to 3rd is 2 days, 1st to 4th is 3 days. So total days: 3 days. The time from 9:25 AM (start) to 14:30 on the 4th.

Total hours: 3 days = 72 hours, plus from start time 9:25 to end time 14:30 on the 4th. Wait, actually, the exact duration:

Start: 2024-04-01 09:25
End: 2024-04-04 14:30

Calculating the difference:

From April 1 09:25 to April 4 09:25 is exactly 3 days (72 hours). Then from 09:25 to 14:30 on the 4th is 5 hours 5 minutes. Total: 72 + 5.083 (5h5m is 5.083 hours) so total 77.08 hours.

Okay, so the durations are:

2001: 1.5h

2002: ~25.9h

2003: ~50.5h

2004: 1.4h

2005: ~77h

Comparing these, Cases 2002, 2003, 2005 are longer. Cases 2001 and 2004 are normal. So the first task is to identify which are significantly longer. Since 25 hours is over a day, and 50 is 2 days, and 77 is over 3 days. The others are under 2 hours. So the significantly longer ones are 2002, 2003, 2005.

Now, the next part is to analyze the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) to see why these took longer.

Looking at Complexity first. 

Looking at cases:

- 2001: Complexity Low, duration 1.5h – quick, as expected.

- 2002: Complexity Medium, took 25.9h. Hmm, that's a big jump.

- 2003: Complexity High, 50h

- 2004: Low, quick.

- 2005: High, 77h.

So higher complexity is related to longer durations. But 2002 is Medium complexity but took 25h, which is way longer than 2001's 1.5h. So maybe the complexity is a factor, but not the only one.

Looking at Region:

- Cases 2001 and 2003 are in Region A.

- 2002, 2004, 2005 are in B.

But 2003 (Region A) is High complexity and took 50h, whereas 2005 (Region B, High) took 77h. Hmm, so maybe Region doesn't directly correlate, but other factors.

Looking at Resources:

Let's check each case's steps and resources involved.

Case 2002 (Region B, Complexity Medium):

Activities:

Submit (CSR_Paul)

Evaluate (Adjuster_Lisa)

Then Request Additional Docs (Adjuster_Lisa at 14:00 on April 1, then Approve on April 2.

Wait, the Request Additional Docs is only once here, on April 1 14:00. Then the next activity is Approve on the next day at 10:00. That's a 20-hour gap between the Request Additional Docs and Approve. Maybe because they had to wait for the docs, but the submitter was in B? Not sure yet.

Case 2003 (Region A, High):

Activities: 

After Evaluate (April 1 09:40), then Request Docs at 11:00 and again at 17:00 (same day). Wait, on April 1, the first Request Docs is at 11 AM, then again at 5 PM same day. Then the next activity is Approve on April 3rd 16:00. Wait, between the last Request Docs at 17:00 on April 1 and the Approve on April 3 at 16:00, there's a gap. That's two days minus a few hours. So maybe the Approve was delayed?

Case 2005 (Region B, High complexity):

Has multiple Request Docs steps. Let's see:

Activities:

Submit, Evaluate, then Request Docs on April 1 11:30, then again on April 2 17:00, then again on April 3 15:00. Then Approve on April 4 10:00. So multiple requests for docs, each time possibly taking time. The Approve is on the 4th, Pay on 14:00, etc. The multiple requests could be causing the delay.

So the key here is the number of Request Docs steps. High complexity cases have more steps of requesting docs, which adds time. Let's see:

Looking at the number of Request Additional Docs:

- 2001: 0 (since it went straight to Approve)

- 2002: 1 Request Docs (on April 1 at 14:00)

- 2003: 2 Requests (April 1 11:00 and 17:00)

- 2004: 0

- 2005: 3 Requests (April 1, 2, 3)

So the number of Request Docs steps seems to correlate with longer durations. High complexity cases have more requests. So maybe complexity (High) leading to more requests, which each take time. 

But also, even Medium complexity case (2002) had 1 request, leading to longer duration. So Complexity likely is a major factor. 

Now looking at the Regions. 

Case 2003 (Region A, High complexity) took 50h, while 2005 (Region B, High) took 77h. So Region A's High took 50 vs B's 77. Hmm. Maybe Region B has slower processing? Or maybe Manager? Let's check the Approver for 2003: Manager_Bill, and 2005 also Manager_Bill? Wait, looking back:

Case 2002's Approve was done by Manager_Ann, while 2003's Approve by Manager_Bill. Wait:

Looking at the data:

Case 2003's Approve was done by Manager_Bike? Wait, let me check the table again.

Looking back at the event log:

Case 2003's Approve is on 2024-04-02 16:00, by Manager_Bike (wait, in the table, the table says:

For case 2003, the Approve is on April 2 16:00, done by Manager_Bike? Wait, checking the table:

Looking at the table for case 2003:

Looking at the event log entries for Case 2003:

- 2003 has activities up to Approve on April 2 16:00 by Manager_Bike (assuming that's the correct name; the table shows "Manager_Bike" or "Manager_Bike"? Wait, in the provided table, let me recheck:

Looking at the user's table:

Case 2003's Approve is "Approve Claim" on April 2 16:00, and the Resource is "Manager_Bill" (from the table's line: "Approve Claim" for 2003 is handled by Manager_Bill. 

Then, in case 2005, the Approve is by Manager_Bike? Let me check:

Case 2005: the Approve is "Approve Claim" on 2024-04-04 10:00, done by Manager_Bike? Wait the table says for 2005's Approve line:

Looking at the table line for Case 2005's Approve:

Looking at the data given for Case 2005:

The Approve is done by Manager_Bike (assuming that's the entry for case 2005, yes. The line for case 2005, Approve Claim is by Manager_Bike. 

So for Case 2003, the Approve is done by Manager_Bike? Wait, in the table, for case 2003's Approve, the Resource is Manager_Bike? Wait, let me check the exact table entries again.

Wait, reviewing the table provided:

Case 2003's entries:

Line for Approve Claim is: "Approve Claim" on 2024-04-02 16:00, Resource Manager_Bike? Let me check the exact table:

Looking at the user's table:

For case 2003's Approve line:

The line says: "Approve Claim" with Resource "Manager_Bike" (assuming that's the entry for that row). Wait, let me check the table again:

Looking at the table:

The line for case 2003's Approve is:

"Approve Claim" | Manager_Bike | A | High?

Wait, the Region for 2003 is A (since in the first line of case 2003, Region is A, and all entries for the case should have same Region? Each row has Region, so for 2003, all entries have Region A.

Case 2005's Region is B, Complexity High.

So for the Approve step, case 2003 was handled by Manager_Mike? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, in the table for case 2003:

The Approve Claim line for case 2003 is:

2003 | 2024-04-02 16:00 | Approve Claim | Manager_Bike | A | High

Wait, perhaps a typo, but maybe Manager_Bike or Manager_Bike? Not sure, but maybe it's Manager_Bike. Regardless, the resource here is different from others?

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that high complexity cases require more steps. Let's see the number of activities. 

Looking at the number of steps:

Case 2001 has 5 steps (Submit, Evaluate, Approve, Pay, Close).

Case2002 has 5 steps as well? Wait:

Case 2002 steps:

1. Submit

2. Evaluate

3. Request Docs (one time)

4. Approve

5. Pay

6. Close? Wait no, counting the entries for 2002:

Looking at case 2002's entries:

- Submit, Evaluate, Request Docs, Approve, Pay, Close: that's 6 steps? Wait in the table, the rows for 2002 are:

Submit (1), Evaluate (2), Request Docs (3), then Approve (4), Pay (5), Close (6). So 6 steps. 

Case2003 has more steps: Submit, Evaluate, Request Docs (twice?), and then Approve, etc. Let me count:

Case2003 has steps:

Submit, Evaluate, Request Docs (April 1 10:00 and 17:00 (two instances?), then Approve on April 2, etc. Wait looking at the table's rows for case 2003:

Breaking down case 2003:

Row 1: Submit

Row 2: Evaluate

Row3: Request Docs (April 1 10:00)

Row4: Request Docs again same day at 17:00 (so two Request Docs steps)

Then the Approve is on April 2 16:00, then Pay and Close on April 3.

So that's 5 steps before Approve? Hmm, anyway, the number of Request Docs steps is a factor.

So in case 2003: 2 Request Docs steps.

Case2005 has 3 Request Docs steps. 

So the number of Request Docs steps is increasing with complexity. High complexity cases have more requests, which take time between each. Each Request Docs might require the claimant to send in docs, which takes time between the request and the next step. 

Also, the time between the last Request Docs and the Approve might be waiting for the docs. 

Additionally, perhaps the Approve step is delayed. Let's look at the steps in detail for each case to see where the delays occur.

Starting with Case 2001 (Low complexity, quick):

No Request Docs, so after Evaluate, they go straight to Approve. So that's quick.

Case2002 (Medium complexity, 26h duration):

They had 1 Request Docs. The steps are:

Submit -> Evaluate (took 40 minutes?), then Request Docs (at 14:00), so from Evaluate (09:45 start) to Request Docs at 14:00, which is 4h15m. Then after Request Docs, the next step is Approve on April 2 at 10:00. So from the Request Docs (April 1 14:00) to Approve on April 2 10:00 is 20 hours (next day). So that's a 20-hour delay? Maybe the documents took time to come in, and then the Approve can't happen until they get the docs. So the time between the last Request and Approve could be part of the delay.

Similarly, for 2003 and 2005, the multiple requests mean more back-and-forth, each adding delays.

For case2003 (High complexity, 50h):

They have two Request Docs steps on the same day (April 1 at 10:00 and 17:00). Wait, same day. Wait, that's the same day. Wait, the first Request Docs is at 10:00, then another at 17:00. Then the Approve is on April 2 16:00. 

Wait, the first Request Docs is at 10 AM, then another at 5 PM same day, so maybe they needed to send another request after the first one wasn't sufficient? That's odd. Maybe the first Request was sent, but then maybe the documents weren't sufficient, so another request was made same day. But then the Approve is only done on April 2nd at 16:00. So from the second Request at 17:00 on the 1st, to Approve on 2nd 16:00 is 23 hours. So again, a long wait.

Case2005 (High, 77h):

Three Request Docs steps: April1 11:30, April2 17:00, April3 15:00. Then Approve on April4 10:00. So after each Request, they have to wait until the next Request, then finally Approve. Each Request adds time. 

So the number of Request Docs steps is correlated with complexity, and each Request adds time between steps. 

Looking at the Resources:

Looking at Resources, maybe certain adjusters or managers are slower. Let's see:

For case2002, the Request Docs was done by Adjuster_Lisa (twice?), no, in case2002, there's only one Request Docs by Adjuster_Lisa on April1 14:00. Then, the Approve was done by Manager_Ann, and the Pay by Finance_Crank? Wait, looking at the table:

Case2002's Approve is handled by Manager_Ann (since the line says "Approve Claim" for 2002 is done by Manager_Ann? Wait, let me check the table:

Looking at the table line for case2002:

The Approve Claim for 2002 is by Manager_Ann (as per the table entry: 

"2002 | 2024-04-02 10:00 | Approve Claim | Manager_Ann | B | Medium"

Ah, yes. So for case2002, the Approve was done by Manager_Ann, who also did case2002's Approve, and case2002's Region B.

Case2003's Approve is by Manager_Bike? Let me see:

Case2003's Approve is "Approve Claim" on April 2 16:00, done by Manager_Bike (assuming that's the entry). The table line for case2003's Approve:

"2003 | 2024-04-02 16:00 | Approve Claim | Manager_Mike | A | High" ?

Wait the user's table for case2003:

Looking at the table line for case2003's Approve:

The line is:

"2003    | 2024-04-02 16:00     | Approve Claim              | Manager_Bike    | A      | High       |"

Assuming Manager_Mike.

Case2005's Approve is by Manager_Mike (?):

Looking at case2005's Approve line: 

"2005    | 2024-04-04 10:00     | Approve Claim              | Manager_Mike    | B      | High       |"

So both high complexity cases (2003 and 2005) have their Approve done by Manager_Mike. 

Wait, maybe Manager_Mike is responsible for High complexity cases, and perhaps he is slower? Let's see:

Looking at the Manager for Approve step:

Case2001's Approve was done by Manager_Ann. 

Case2002's Approve by Manager_Ann (medium complexity).

Case2003: Manager_Mike (High)

Case2005: Manager_Mike (High).

So perhaps Manager_Mike is handling the high complexity cases, but taking longer. 

Looking at the time between the last Request Docs and Approve:

For case2003: the last Request Docs is at April1 17:00, then Approve is on April2 16:00. So 23 hours later. 

For case2005's last Request Docs is April3 15:00, then Approve is April4 10:00: that's 29 hours later. 

So the time between the last Request Docs and Approve is part of the delay, but perhaps the Approver (Manager_Mike) is slow in processing after receiving the documents? Or maybe the documents are being processed over days. 

Alternatively, the time between the Request Docs and next step. 

Alternatively, the number of Request Docs steps (each requiring time to get the docs and process) is the main cause. 

Now, the task is to find root causes from the attributes: Resource, Region, Complexity.

First, identify which cases have performance issues: Cases 2002 (25.9h), 2003 (50h), 2005 (77h). So these are the long ones.

Now, to find root causes:

Looking at Complexity:

- High complexity cases (2003 and 2005) are longer. But 2002 (Medium) is also longer than 2001 and 2004 (both low complexity). So complexity seems to be a factor.

Region: 

Looking at Region A and B:

Case2002 (Region B, 25.9h vs Region A's 2003 at 50h). Hmm, but 2005 (Region B, High) is even longer. Not sure if Region is a factor. Maybe Region B's cases are worse? Let's see:

Looking at the Regions:

Region A:

Cases 2001 (short), Low), handled by various Resources.

Case2003 (Region A, High, took longer. 

Region B:

Case2002 (Medium, 25h)

Case2004 (Low, quick)

Case2005 (High, 77h).

So comparing Region A's high complexity (50h vs Region B's high (77h), so maybe Region B's High complexity cases are worse? Not sure yet.

Looking at Resources:

The Adjusters and Managers involved.

Looking at the Adjuster for Request Docs:

Case2002's Adjuster was Lisa (Region B), who did the Request Docs once. 

Case2003's Adjuster was Mike (Region A), who did two Request Docs steps on the same day. 

Case2005's Adjuster_Liza (maybe Lisa again? Let me see:

Looking at case2005's Adjuster for Request Docs:

Looking at the table's line for case2005's Request Docs:

Case2005 has three Request Docs entries, all by Adjuster_Lisa (assuming that's the name). Let me check:

Case2005's Request Docs steps:

"Request Additional Documents | Adjuster_Lisa" in each of the three instances (April1 11:30, April2 17:00, April3 15:00). So Adjuster_Lisa is handling those.

So maybe Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) is handling multiple requests but taking longer? Or perhaps the time between the Request and the next step is the issue.

Alternatively, the time between steps:

Looking at the time between the last Request Docs and the Approve:

For case2002: The Request Docs was on April1 14:00, then Approve on April2 10:00. The time between is 20h (from 2 PM to 10 AM next day: 20h).

Case2003: Last Request Docs was April1 17:00, Approve on April2 16:00. 23h.

Case2005: Last Request Docs on April3 15:00, Approve on April4 10:00. So 29h between last request and Approve.

So those gaps are part of the delay, which could be due to waiting for the claimant to provide docs, but that's external. The internal processing might be the Manager's handling time.

Looking at the Managers:

Manager_Ann handled case2002 (Medium, 25h) and case2004 (Low, quick). So Manager_Ann is handling medium and low, but in 2002, took 25h. 

Meanwhile, Manager_Mike (or Mikes?) for case2003 and 2005. Wait, the Managers for High complexity are Manager_Mike in 2003 and 2005 (assuming Manager_Mike and Manager_Bike? Maybe a typo. Let me check the table again:

For case2003's Approve: 

"Approve Claim" | Manager_Mike | A | High 

Case2005:

"Approve Claim" | Manager_Mike (?), the exact name?

Wait in the provided table:

Case2003's Approve is "Manager_Bike" (assuming a typo for Mike?) 

Case2005's Approve is "Manager_Mike" or another?

Wait, let me check the exact entries:

Looking at the user's table for case2005's Approve Claim:

Looking at the line for case2005's Approve:

"2005    | 2024-04-04 10:00     | Approve Claim              | Manager_Mike    | B      | High       |"

Assuming Mikes are the same person? Let's see. So both high complexity cases have Manager_Mike, who may be handling more cases or slower?

Alternatively, the Manager for high complexity is the same person, and maybe they have a backlog, leading to longer delays. 

Additionally, the number of Request Docs steps is tied to complexity. High complexity cases have more steps, which obviously adds time. 

So the root causes would be:

- High complexity claims require more Request Docs steps, each requiring time for the claimant to respond, increasing duration.

- The number of Request Docs steps (which are more in High complexity cases) are a key factor.

Additionally, maybe the Resources involved in handling these steps have delays. 

Looking at the Adjusters:

For case2002, Adjuster_Lisa handled the Request Docs once. 

Case2003's Adjuster_Mike did two Request Docs on the same day? That's odd. Maybe he was trying to get the documents quickly but still needed multiple steps.

Case2005's Adjuster_Lisa did three requests, which might indicate that the same adjuster is handling more steps but they are taking longer.

Alternatively, the time between the initial Evaluate and the first Request Docs could be a factor. 

Alternatively, the Approver (Manager_Mike) for high complexity cases might have a longer approval time. For example, in case2003, after the last Request Docs at 17:00 on April1, the Approve is at 16:00 next day (April2). So 23h later. But maybe that's part of the process, as they have to wait for the docs, which is external. 

So the main root causes are likely:

1. **Complexity Level**: High complexity claims require multiple document requests, which increase the number of interactions and waiting for the claimant to respond, leading to longer durations. 

2. **Region might play a role**: Case2003 (Region A, High) took 50h, while Region B's high (2005) took longer (77h). Not sure if Region is a factor here, but maybe the regions have different response times from customers.

Alternatively, looking at which Resources are involved in causing delays. 

Looking at the Resources for the Approve step: 

Manager_Mike handles both High cases (2003 and 2005), but they have different regions. 

Wait, case2003 is Region A, handled by Manager_Mike, and case2005 (Region B, same Manager). Hmm, but the duration difference might not be due to the Manager, as both are his. Maybe his handling time is the same, but the claimant's response time is longer in region B?

Alternatively, the Resources handling the Approve step, but Manager_Mike's cases are taking longer because of the complexity and multiple requests, not necessarily his own inefficiency.

Another angle: The Adjuster's handling. For example, Adjuster_Mike (in case2003, in Region A) is handling the case, but the multiple requests might be due to his need to request more info multiple times. But that's part of the process for high complexity.

Alternatively, maybe in Region B, the Approve is done by the same Manager but takes longer. 

Alternatively, the Resources for the Adjusters: like, Adjuster_Liza (case2002 and 2005) might be slower in following up? Or maybe the time between the Approve and Pay is not the issue, but the multiple steps.

Now, to structure the answer:

First, identify cases with long durations: 2002,2003,2005.

Then, analyze attributes:

Complexity:

- All long cases except 2002 (which is medium) but even medium can be longer than low.

So, High complexity definitely contributes. 

Region: 

Looking at the Regions for the long cases:

2002 (B), 25h), Medium)

2003 (A, 50h, High)

2005 (B,77h, High)

Comparing Region A and B for High:

Case2003 (A) took 50h, and 2005 (B) took 77h. So Region B's High cases take longer. Maybe in B, the process is slower due to some regional issues.

Resources:

Manager_Mike handles both High cases (2003 and2005), but in different regions. 

The Adjusters: 

In case2002, the Adjuster was Lisa (Region B) with 1 Request.

In case2003, Adjuster_Mike (Region A) did two Requests.

In case2005, Adjuster_Liza (maybe Lisa?) did three requests.

So Adjuster_Liza (maybe same Lisa) in case2005 had to do three requests, which might be a lot.

But the Adjuster’s efficiency might not be the main issue, but the number of steps.

Proposing explanations:

Root causes likely include:

- Higher complexity claims (High/Medium) require more interactions (more Request Docs steps), leading to delays. High complexity has more requests, leading to longer total time.

- The number of Request Docs steps directly contributes to longer durations.

Additionally, perhaps in Region B, even though the Approve is done by the same Manager, the delays are longer, maybe due to more steps, but it's possible that in Region B, there's something else.

Alternatively, the case2005 (Region B, High) has three Requests, which is more than 2003's two, hence contributing to longer time.

So the root causes are:

1. High complexity cases require more document requests, each adding time between steps (customer response time).

2. The number of Requests is driven by the complexity. So complexity is the main root cause, but perhaps also the region's customer response time.

Alternatively, looking at the time between each step for the Request Docs:

For case2003:

Between the two Request Docs steps on April1: first at 10 AM, next at 5 PM. So only a few hours between them, but then 23h until Approve.

Hmm.

Another angle: the time between the Approve and Pay steps.

Wait, after the last Request Docs, the Approve is after a delay. The Approver (Manager_Mike) might be delayed in approving after the last Request. 

Alternatively, maybe the Manager has to handle more, leading to backlogs. 

Alternatively, perhaps in case2005, the three Requests took longer because of the number of requests. 

So, the main root causes are:

- Complexity: Higher complexity leads to more
