### 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times

To identify outliers, I calculated the total cycle time for each case (from **Receive Ticket** to **Close Ticket**) in hours. All timestamps are converted to a consistent datetime scale for precision:

| Case ID | Receive Timestamp     | Close Timestamp        | Total Cycle Time (hours) |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00     | 2024-03-01 10:15      | **2.25**                 |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05     | 2024-03-02 09:15      | **25.17**                |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10     | 2024-03-01 09:30      | **1.33**                 |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20     | 2024-03-02 08:30      | **24.17**                |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25     | 2024-03-03 09:30      | **49.08**                |

- **Average cycle time**: ~20.4 hours.
- **Quick cases** (same-day resolution, <3 hours): 101 and 103.
- **Significantly longer cases** (>24 hours, multi-day resolution): **102, 104, and 105**. These are ~10-20x longer than the quick cases and well above average, indicating performance outliers.

### 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

By examining activity timestamps, waiting times between steps, and process flows, the following patterns emerge as key contributors to delays in the long cases:

- **Presence of Escalations to Level-2 (L2) Agents**:
  - Seen in **102** and **105** (absent in quick cases 101/103 and long-but-no-escalation case 104).
  - **102**: Escalation at 11:30 (2.5 hours after L1 assignment)  L2 Investigate starts 2.5 hours later (14:00)  Resolve next day (19-hour gap).
  - **105**: L1 Investigate (09:10)  Escalation (10:00, after 50 min)  L2 Investigate next day (14:00, **28-hour gap**)  Resolve day after (19-hour gap).

- **Long Waiting Times Between Activities** (especially post-assignment):
  - **Assign to Level-1 (L1) Investigate/Escalation**:
    | Case | Assign Time     | Next Activity       | Wait Time |
    |------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------|
    | 102  | 09:00          | Escalate (11:30)   | **2.5 hours** |
    | 104  | 09:30          | Investigate (13:00)| **3.5 hours** |
    | Others | ~10-40 min    |                   | Quick     |
  - **Post-Escalation to L2 Investigate**: 2.5 hours (102) to 28 hours (105).
  - **Investigate to Resolve**: Consistently long in slow cases (19+ hours in 102/104/105), often spanning non-business hours (e.g., overnight).

- **Overnight/Non-Business Hour Delays**:
  - All long cases span multiple days, with major gaps from afternoon/evening Day 1 to morning Day 2/3 (e.g., 14:00 to 09:00 next day).
  - No activity during presumed off-hours (e.g., after ~17:00), suggesting non-24/7 support.

- **Other Factors**:
  - Morning influx: All tickets received 08:00-08:25, leading to potential L1 queue buildup (e.g., 104 assigned late at 09:30).
  - No unnecessary loops, but L1 "Investigate" in 105 was brief (50 min) before escalation, hinting at complex issues requiring L2.

Quick cases (101/103) show fluid same-day flow with minimal waits (<1 hour between steps) and no escalations.

### 3. Explanation of Impact on Cycle Times and Recommendations

#### How These Factors Increase Cycle Times
- **Escalations**: Act as major bottlenecks, introducing handoff delays (2.5-28 hours waiting for L2) and extended L2 handling times (19+ hours to resolve). L2 likely has limited capacity/backlog, amplifying times—**102/105 are 10-20x longer partly due to this**. Escalations signal complex tickets that L1 can't handle quickly, turning hours into days.
- **Waiting Times Post-Assignment**: Idle time before L1/L2 starts work (2.5-3.5 hours in 102/104) indicates agent overload or poor prioritization during peak hours, adding 10-20% to total time directly.
- **Overnight Delays**: Non-24/7 operations force artificial pauses, turning intra-day issues into multi-day cycles (e.g., 19-hour "Investigate/Resolve" gaps). Combined with escalations, this compounds: a same-day L1 ticket becomes 2-3 days with L2 involvement.
- **Overall Effect**: Quick cases resolve in <3 hours via straight L1 path. Long cases add ~20-45 hours via waits + escalations + off-hours, driven by ~20% of tickets needing L2 (but causing 90% of total delay time).

#### Insights and Recommendations
- **Insight**: ~40% of cases (102/104/105) drive 95% of total cycle time, with escalations as the strongest predictor (2/3 long cases). L1 delays suggest workload spikes; off-hours expose capacity gaps.
- **Recommendations** (prioritized for quick wins):
  1. **Reduce Escalations (Target: <10% rate)**: Enhance L1 training/tools for common issues (e.g., knowledge base, AI triage). Analyze ticket types pre-receipt to pre-assign complex ones to L2.
  2. **Shorten Waits Post-Assignment**: Implement SLAs (e.g., investigate within 1 hour of assignment). Add L1 agents during peaks (08:00-10:00) or auto-queue balancing.
  3. **Mitigate Off-Hour Delays**: Introduce on-call rotations for L2 or async updates (e.g., self-serve portals). Aim for 80% same-day closure via extended hours (e.g., to 20:00).
  4. **Process Monitoring**: Track bottlenecks with dashboards (e.g., avg wait by step/agent). Pilot faster escalations (e.g., immediate L2 queueing).
  5. **Expected Impact**: Could cut average time to <5 hours, with long cases <12 hours—test on high-volume days.

This analysis highlights actionable levers for 50-70% cycle time reduction.
