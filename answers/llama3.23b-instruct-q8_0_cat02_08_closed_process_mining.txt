Here are some proposed opposites and more general concepts in the process mining field:

**Opposites:**

1. **Automated Process Discovery**: Opposite could be **Manually Designed Process Modeling** - this would involve creating process models from scratch, rather than automatically discovering them from data.
2. **Predictive Monitoring**: Opposite could be ** Reactive Monitoring** - this would focus on detecting anomalies and taking corrective action immediately, rather than predicting future deviations.
3. **Bottom-up Discovery**: Opposite could be **Top-down Design** - this would involve starting with a preconceived process design and then validating it against data, rather than discovering the process from the bottom up.
4. **Process Simulation**: Opposite could be **Process Analysis** - this would focus on analyzing existing processes without simulating their behavior, instead examining historical data and performance metrics.
5. **Process Efficiency**: This one doesn't have a direct opposite, as it's a general concept that can be achieved through various means. However, an alternative approach could be **Process Optimization**, which focuses on improving specific aspects of the process.
6. **Real-time Monitoring**: Opposite could be **Historical Analysis** - this would involve analyzing data from past periods to gain insights into processes, rather than monitoring them in real-time.

**More General Concepts:**

1. **Process Mining as a Service (MaaS)**: This concept involves providing process mining capabilities on-demand, without requiring organizations to manage the underlying technology or expertise.
2. **Explainable Process Intelligence**: This concept focuses on making process intelligence more transparent and understandable for stakeholders, by providing insights into how models are trained, validated, and used.

**Other related concepts:**

1. **Process Governance**: This concept involves establishing a framework for managing and governing processes within an organization, ensuring that they align with business objectives.
2. **Digital Process Twinning**: This concept involves creating a digital replica of an existing process, allowing organizations to test and optimize it without affecting the real-world process.

These concepts can help broaden the scope of process mining and provide alternative perspectives on the field.
