Certainly! Below is a structured grouping of the sample event log’s low-level events into high-level process steps, along with detailed explanations and the resulting hierarchical mapping.

### 1. **Proposed High-Level Process Steps**

| **High-Level Step**            | **Constituent Low-Level Events**                                                                                                 | **Rationale**                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Material Preparation**       | - Retrieve raw metal sheet<br>- Scan barcode<br>- Place metal sheet on table<br>- Align metal sheet<br>- Preheat metal sheet    | All these activities serve the purpose of receiving, identifying, setting up, and conditioning raw materials before any assembly. They occur sequentially and close in time and involve preparation of material for downstream processes. |
| **Assembly (Welding)**         | - Pick up welding tool<br>- Weld corner A<br>- Weld corner B                                                                     | This group involves using equipment (welding tool) and executing the key assembly action (joining parts). Picking up the tool initiates this phase, followed by multiple welds executed by the same resource.                       |
| **Quality Control**            | - Measure weld integrity                                                                                                         | This is the distinct inspection/check occurring immediately after assembly before any further processing. It represents a dedicated quality check step.    |
| **Finishing**                  | - Apply protective coating<br>- Dry coating                                                                                      | These steps are post-assembly treatments designed to protect and finalize the component. Both deal with the application and solidification of protective materials.                          |
| **Final Inspection**           | - Visual check                                                                                                                   | This concluding activity ensures that the finished product passes a manual visual QA step before proceeding out of the manufacturing process.                                                |

### 2. **Justification in Detail**

#### **Material Preparation**
- **Why?**  
  These events collectively prepare the raw input for processing. It starts from retrieving—the first interaction with a new part—and includes identification (scanning), placement, mechanical alignment via the robot, and preconditioning by heating. All these activities are foundational to starting any assembly work, logically forming the *Material Preparation* phase.

#### **Assembly (Welding)**
- **Why?**  
  The operator picks up the welding tool to then perform spot welds on multiple corners. These are sequential actions with the same resource and tool, focusing on physically assembling the product. They transform raw prepared parts into an assembled state, clearly marking this cohesive phase.

#### **Quality Control**
- **Why?**  
  There is a discrete sensor-based integrity measurement immediately after welding. It stands out as an assessment checkpoint to verify assembly quality before any finishing steps and would often inform whether rework is needed at this stage.

#### **Finishing**
- **Why?**  
  Application and curing of protective coatings occur after successful welding and quality check. Both are chemically related and temporally proximate, fitting together as post-assembly surface finishing to protect and prepare items for final use.

#### **Final Inspection**
- **Why?**  
  Performed manually after all other steps, it serves as the final product quality assurance before packaging or shipping, acting as the last gate for defects or cosmetic issues.

### 4. **Additional Notes**

- These high-level activities provide a simplified **5-stage manufacturing process model** suitable for process mining, execution monitoring, or communication purposes.
- The grouping relies on temporal sequence, resource type, manufacturing domain knowledge (e.g., prepping, assembling, inspecting, finishing), and activity semantics.
- For the full event log, applying this mapping allows converting granular event streams into higher-level, interpretable workflows, enabling better analysis or dashboarding.

**In conclusion**, by analyzing timestamps, resource roles, and activity semantics, we can abstract granular logs into straightforward process phases:  
**Material Preparation  Assembly  Quality Control  Finishing  Final Inspection**  
This enables clearer understanding and control over the complex manufacturing workflow.
