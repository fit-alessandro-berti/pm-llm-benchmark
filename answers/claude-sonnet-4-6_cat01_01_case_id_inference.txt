## Case Grouping Analysis

### Methodology
I'll use **patient demographics (age + gender)** as the primary identifier, cross-validated by **department consistency**, **logical activity flow**, and **temporal ordering**.

### Identified Cases

####  Case 1 — Male, Age 45, ER Patient (Private Insurance)

| # | Timestamp | Activity | Department |
|---|-----------|----------|------------|
| 1 | 08:05:13 | Register patient | ER |
| 4 | 08:10:50 | Initial triage (code=3) | ER |
| 7 | 08:15:42 | X-ray imaging (left leg) | Radiology |
| 12 | 08:23:10 | Doctor consultation (hairline fracture) | ER |
| 15 | 08:30:05 | Patient discharged (outpatient clinic) | ER |

**Narrative:** 45-year-old male walks into the ER  triaged (code 3, non-urgent)  sent for X-ray on left leg  diagnosed with hairline fracture  discharged with outpatient follow-up.  Perfectly coherent clinical flow.

####  Case 2 — Female, Age 62, ER Patient (Public Insurance)

| # | Timestamp | Activity | Department |
|---|-----------|----------|------------|
| 2 | 08:07:02 | Register patient | ER |
| 5 | 08:12:29 | Initial triage (code=2) | ER |
| 8 | 08:16:10 | Lab test requested (blood panel) | ER |
| 10 | 08:20:27 | Lab test completed (normal levels) | Laboratory |
| 11 | 08:22:54 | Doctor consultation (minor infection) | ER |
| 14 | 08:27:00 | Prescription created (antibiotics) | ER |
| 17 | 08:35:29 | Patient discharged (pharmacy pickup) | ER |

**Narrative:** 62-year-old female registers in ER  triaged (code 2, urgent)  blood panel ordered  results return normal  diagnosed with minor infection  prescribed antibiotics  discharged to pharmacy.  Perfectly coherent clinical flow.

####  Case 3 — Male, Age 28, Surgery Patient (Private Insurance)

| # | Timestamp | Activity | Department |
|---|-----------|----------|------------|
| 3 | 08:07:15 | Register patient | Surgery |
| 6 | 08:13:00 | Doctor consultation (scheduled knee surgery) | Surgery |
| 9 | 08:16:45 | Surgery preparation (general anesthesia) | Surgery |
| 13 | 08:25:19 | Surgery performed (arthroscopy) | Surgery |
| 16 | 08:31:37 | Recovery room (stable) | Surgery |
| 18 | 08:40:13 | Patient discharged (physiotherapy) | Surgery |

**Narrative:** 28-year-old male registers for a **pre-scheduled** knee surgery  consults with Dr. Lee  prepared under general anesthesia  undergoes arthroscopy  recovers stably  discharged with physiotherapy follow-up.  Perfectly coherent clinical flow.

### Summary Table

| Case | Patient | Events | Pathway |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Case 1** | Male, 45 | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 | ER  Radiology  ER discharge |
| **Case 2** | Female, 62 | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 | ER  Lab  ER discharge |
| **Case 3** | Male, 28 | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 | Surgery  OR  Recovery  discharge |

> **Key discriminators used:** `patient_age` + `patient_gender` (unique per case), `department` consistency, logical medical sequence, and resource continuity (e.g., Dr. Lee handles Case 3's surgery; Dr. Smith handles Case 2's ER care).
