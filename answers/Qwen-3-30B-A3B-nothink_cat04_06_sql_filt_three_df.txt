Here's a **DuckDB SQL query** that fulfills all the requirements in your prompt:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find all case_ids that have the exact sequence of three activities in order
WITH SequenceCases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
    FROM event_log e1
    JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
    JOIN event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'
),

-- Step 2: Exclude these case_ids from the final result
FinalEvents AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM SequenceCases)
)

-- Step 3: Return all events not in the excluded cases
SELECT *
FROM FinalEvents
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

###  Explanation:

1. **SequenceCases CTE**:
   - This CTE identifies all `case_id`s that have the exact sequence:
     - 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
     - 'Create Order'
     - 'Confirm Order'
   - It ensures the events are in order by using the `timestamp` field.
   - It also checks that the time between `Create Order` and `Confirm Order` is **more than 5 days** using `e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'`.

2. **FinalEvents CTE**:
   - This selects all events from `event_log` **except** those that belong to the `case_id`s found in `SequenceCases`.

3. **Final SELECT**:
   - Returns all the events that are **not** part of the filtered cases.
   - It's ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity and consistency.

---

###  Notes:
- This query assumes that the `event_log` is already ordered by `timestamp` within each `case_id`. If not, you may need to sort or use window functions for more accurate sequence detection.
- If your data has multiple occurrences of the same activity in a case, this query will still work because it looks for the **exact sequence in order**.

Let me know if you want a version that uses window functions or handles cases with multiple sequences.
