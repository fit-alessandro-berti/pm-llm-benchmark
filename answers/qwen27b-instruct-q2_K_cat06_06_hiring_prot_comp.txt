Based on the data provided, here are some key differences between ER (Emergency Room) registrations and FD registrations:

In both ER registrations and FD registrations:
1. The core process seems to involve going through examinations -> diagnosis -> treatment -> discharge in varying order with performance values indicating completion rates.

2. Both ER registrations (~3k) & FD registrations (~4k) go through multiple failure states (unsuccessful diagnosis, treatment ineffective etc.), followed by a successful outcome.

3. Registrations at both ER and FD involve going through expert examinations. In ER registration cases, these are often part of the initial steps followed by further examinations and then to diagnosis, treatments etc.).

4. Both ER registrations (~3k) & FD registrations (~4k) involve the main process of getting discharged following completion of treatment.

Main differences:
  
  
  
* The data provided suggests that there is a higher frequency (ER ~ ER registrations =~ 50 times per performance, while FD registrations =~times per performance) and possibly more extensive detail in the performance metrics between ER registrations (~performance values up to approximations in lakhs) vs FD registrations (~performance values in thousands) which could imply different operational contexts or the processes are monitored differently across ERs and FDs.

* The specific breakdown numbers indicate that ER registrations have slightly more failed attempts (unsuccessful diagnosis etc.) before achieving a successful discharge compared to FD registrations (~29 vs ~14 in ER, ~19 vs ~~times in FD).

* In both cases there exists a progression from initial registration, examination stages leading towards diagnosis which results in treatment and discharge until success is achieved however this process is varied with some instances involving multiple failures before reaching ultimate success.

Note that exact difference details such as performance values for ER/ FD could vary depending on the context of what 'performance' metrics represent specifically (e.g., time taken, resources spent etc.), but there seems to be more detail in data collection for ER registrations compared typically for FD operations
