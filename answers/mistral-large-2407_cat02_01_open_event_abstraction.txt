Event abstraction is a powerful technique for improving the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. Here's how you can effectively utilize it:

1. **Reduce Complexity**: Event abstraction allows you to aggregate or hide less important or detailed events, making the process model simpler and easier to understand. By focusing on key events, you can reduce the cognitive load required to comprehend the model.

2. **Hierarchical Modeling**: Create hierarchical process models by abstracting events at different levels of detail. At the top level, you can have abstracted events representing high-level activities. Each of these can be further decomposed into more detailed sub-processes, allowing users to drill down into the model as needed.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and abstract recurring patterns or sub-processes in the event log. This can help in creating modular process models, where complex patterns are encapsulated into single abstracted events.

4. **Focus on Relevant Behavior**: By abstracting events, you can focus on the most relevant behavior for your analysis. For example, if you're interested in the loan application process, you might abstract away technical events related to IT systems, focusing instead on events like "Application Received", "Approval Decision", etc.

5. **Simplify Visualization**: Complex process models can be difficult to visualize. Event abstraction can help in creating simpler, cleaner visualizations that highlight the main process flow, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or anomalies.

6. **Improve Comparability**: Abstracting events can make it easier to compare different process variants or models. By focusing on high-level activities, you can more readily identify similarities and differences between processes.

Here's a simple example:

* Original event log: `[Login, Open Application, Fill Section A, Fill Section B, Fill Section C, Submit Application, Logout]`
* Abstracted event log: `[Start Session, Complete Application, End Session]`

In the abstracted version, the detailed events related to filling out the application are aggregated into a single "Complete Application" event, making the process model simpler and more readable.

To effectively utilize event abstraction, you should:

- Understand the process and the goals of your analysis to determine the appropriate level of abstraction.
- Use domain knowledge to guide the abstraction process.
- Iteratively refine your abstractions based on feedback and new insights.
- Ensure that the abstractions accurately reflect the underlying process.
- Use tools and techniques that support event abstraction, such as process mining software.
