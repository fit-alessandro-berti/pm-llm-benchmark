  
1. Normative-rule compliance (strict, “must”)  
  
• Case 1 – COMPLIANT  
  – All required activities occur and follow the mandated order:
    Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
• Case 2 – VIOLATION  
  1. Risk Assessment executed before Credit Check (ordering rule broken).  
  2. Inform Applicant never appears (mandatory step missing).  
  3. Finalize Documentation executed after a Rejected decision (explicitly forbidden).  
  4. Case is closed even though (2) and (3) already breach the process.  
• Case 3 – COMPLIANT (with respect to strict ordering)  
  – Sequence is correct and the “approved” branch is followed properly before closing.

  
2. Desiderata compliance (recommended, “nice-to-have”)  
  
Timing windows: Credit Check  24 h after application; Inform Applicant  48 h after decision; optional Follow-up Call before closure.

• Case 1 – Minor desiderata deviations  
  – No Follow-up Call recorded.  
  – All timing recommendations met (Credit Check 0.5 h after application; Inform 2 h after decision).  

• Case 2 – Desiderata observations (in addition to the hard violations)  
  – Credit Check took place 40 min after application (OK).  
  – Because Inform Applicant never occurred, the 48-hour guideline cannot even be assessed.  
  – No Follow-up Call recorded.  

• Case 3 – Desiderata deviations  
  – Credit Check happened 49 h after application (exceeds 24-h guideline).  
  – Inform Applicant occurred 51 h after decision (exceeds 48-h guideline).  
  – No Follow-up Call recorded.  

  
3. Possible interpretations / mitigation suggestions  
  
Case 2  
• Performing Risk Assessment first may signal a mistaken manual launch or a system UI that places the Risk tool ahead of the Credit module; tightening UI controls or adding pre-conditions in the workflow engine would prevent this.  
• Finalizing documentation after a rejection could stem from an operator trying to capture denial paperwork; rename that task to “Generate Rejection Letter” to avoid confusion, and ensure the real “Finalize Documentation” task is enabled only on the “approved” path.  
• The missing Inform Applicant is critical; an automatic email step triggered by the decision could close that gap.

Case 3  
• The delays (49 h and 51 h) suggest either workload peaks or hand-offs between departments; adding SLA alerts (e.g., dashboard warnings at 20 h/40 h) could nudge staff.  
• If Follow-up Calls are beneficial but routinely skipped, consider nudging agents with an automated reminder or embedding it as a default sub-task that can be explicitly waived with a reason code.

Case 1  
• Only the (optional) Follow-up Call is missing. If calling is impractical for straightforward approvals, documenting an acceptable waiver policy might capture the intent without forcing unnecessary work.

Overall: only Case 2 breaches mandatory policy and needs immediate correction; Cases 1 & 3 merely show opportunities to improve service quality and customer experience.
