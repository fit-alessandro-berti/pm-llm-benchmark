1. **Market Research & R&D**  
- How might the scope and methodology of market research influence the design priorities in the prototype stage?  
- What mechanisms could be introduced to ensure that R&D teams integrate real-time customer insights into the design process?  

2. **Component Sourcing**  
- What criteria should guide the selection of component suppliers across different countries beyond cost and availability?  
- How can the company mitigate potential risks arising from geopolitical tensions or trade restrictions in supplier regions?  
- What strategies could balance reliance on specialized global suppliers with the need for supply flexibility and resilience?  

3. **Logistics & Assembly**  
- How might the choice of Malaysia as the assembly hub affect lead times, labor costs, and supply chain risk compared to alternative locations?  
- What redundancy or contingency plans should be built into the shipment of components to prevent bottlenecks?  
- How could digital twins or real-time tracking improve visibility in the assembly and logistics phases?  

4. **Quality Control & Production Efficiency**  
- What are the trade-offs between strict quality thresholds and the costs of rework or scrapping units?  
- How might predictive analytics be applied to anticipate defects before they occur in the assembly line?  

5. **Distribution & Market Reach**  
- What factors should drive the decision to use air freight versus maritime cargo for different markets?  
- How can regulatory compliance checks be streamlined without sacrificing rigor or increasing risk exposure?  
- What innovations in customs clearance or digital documentation could accelerate cross-border shipments?  

6. **Regional & Local Distribution**  
- How can regional distribution centers optimize their balance between serving local retailers, e-commerce, and direct shipment channels?  
- What new models of last-mile delivery could enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction in diverse markets?  

7. **Performance & Adaptability**  
- How should performance metrics be balanced across cost efficiency, speed, customer satisfaction, and sustainability?  
- In what ways could advanced forecasting models better respond to rapid demand shifts in global markets?  
- How might the company monitor and measure the resilience of its supply chain beyond traditional KPIs like lead time and fulfillment rates?  

8. **Risk Management & Strategic Communication**  
- What role should communication with stakeholders (suppliers, regulators, distributors, customers) play in managing risks across the supply chain?  
- How might transparency in sourcing and logistics processes be leveraged as a competitive advantage in marketing and customer trust?

Would you like me to **group these questions into categories like “Risk Management,” “Efficiency,” “Resilience,” and “Sustainability”** so they can be used as a structured discussion guide for workshops?
