We are constructing a Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process.

 Steps:
 1. Identify constraints that are natural for the process.

 Let's break down the process:

 - The process starts with "Receive Order (RO)".
 - Then, we "Check Availability (CA)". If items are not available, the order might be put on hold or canceled? But the problem doesn't specify cancellation. We assume the process continues only if available.
 - After checking availability, we "Reserve Items (RI)".
 - Then, we "Pick Items (PI)".
 - Then, a "Quality Check (QC)" is performed.
 - Then, we "Pack Order (PO)".
 - Then, we "Generate Shipping Label (GSL)".
 - Then, we "Dispatch (D)".
 - After dispatch, we can "Invoice Customer (IC)".
 - Finally, when payment is received, we "Record Payment (RP)".

 However, note that invoicing might happen after dispatch and then payment recording. Also, note that some activities might occur only once? And some constraints might be:

 Constraints:

 1. Equivalence: 
    - We don't have two activities that must occur the same number of times? 
    - Let's think: RO and D? They both occur exactly once per order? Actually, every activity occurs exactly once per order? 
    - But note: the problem says "if the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one". 
    - Since every activity that occurs in a case must occur at least once? Actually, we might have optional activities? 
    - However, in this scenario, all activities are mandatory? 

    But wait: what if an order fails the quality check? Then we might have to re-pick? So PI might occur multiple times? 
    The problem does not specify rework. We assume a linear process without rework? 

    Given the problem description, it seems each activity is done once. So every activity occurs exactly once per case? 

    However, the problem says: "Activity Occurrences: Bounds the number of occurrences for an activity in a case." 
    We can set each activity to {1} meaning exactly once? 

    But note: the example had `{'A': {0,1}, 'B': {1,2}}`. So we can set:

    activ_freq: 
        RO: {1}
        CA: {1}
        RI: {1}
        PI: {1}   ... but what if quality check fails? The problem doesn't specify. So we assume one time.

    However, the problem says "complex order fulfillment", but without specifying loops, we assume each activity once.

    So we set every activity to {1}. But note: what about Record Payment? It might occur later? But still, per order, it occurs once.

 2. Always Before:
    - If CA occurs, then RO must have occurred before? Yes, because we can't check availability without receiving the order.
    - Similarly, RI must be after CA? And before PI? 
    - We can define:
        always_before: 
            (CA, RO)   -> if CA occurs then RO must have occurred before? But note: the constraint is: if the first activity occurs, then the second should have been executed previously.
            So we write: (CA, RO) meaning: if CA occurs then RO must have occurred before? Actually, note: RO is the first activity. So for every activity after RO, we require RO to be before.

        We can list:
            (CA, RO)
            (RI, RO), (RI, CA)   -> because RI must be after both RO and CA? But note: the constraint is only about the immediate requirement? Actually, the constraint is transitive? 
            However, the constraint is direct: if RI occurs, then RO must have occurred? Yes, because we received the order. Similarly, if RI occurs, then CA must have occurred? Because we reserve only after checking.

        But note: we don't need to state (RI, RO) if we already have (CA, RO) and (RI, CA) and transitivity? However, the Log Skeleton constraints are not necessarily transitive? We have to state all pairs? 

        Actually, the Log Skeleton constraints are independent. So we must state every direct requirement? But also, the model might be built with the entire partial order? 

        However, the problem does not specify the exact level of detail. We can state:

        - For every activity X that is not RO, we require that RO is always before X? 
        - Similarly, for CA: every activity after CA must have CA before? 

        But note: the constraint is only between two activities. We can define:

        always_before = {
            (CA, RO), 
            (RI, RO), (RI, CA),
            (PI, RO), (PI, CA), (PI, RI),
            (QC, RO), (QC, CA), (QC, RI), (QC, PI),
            (PO, RO), (PO, CA), (PO, RI), (PO, PI), (PO, QC),
            (GSL, RO), ... and so on until (GSL, PO),
            (D, ... all before ...),
            (IC, ... all before D? Actually, IC must be after dispatch? But before? No, after dispatch. So IC must have all the previous activities? 
            (IC, RO), (IC, CA), ... (IC, D) -> but note: D is before IC? So if IC occurs, then D must have occurred? So (IC, D) is not in always_before? Because always_before says: if IC occurs then D must have been executed previously? That is true. So (IC, D) is in always_before? 

        Actually, we can note that the process is sequential? So we can define:

        always_before = set()
        activities = ['RO', 'CA', 'RI', 'PI', 'QC', 'PO', 'GSL', 'D', 'IC', 'RP']

        For i in range(1, len(activities)):
            for j in range(0, i):
                always_before.add( (activities[i], activities[j]) )

        But wait: is the process strictly sequential? 
        - After RO, we do CA. Then RI, then PI, then QC, then PO, then GSL, then D, then IC, then RP.

        So yes, we can define the always_before as the requirement that every activity must be preceded by all the activities that come before it in the sequence.

        However, note: the constraint "Always Before" is not necessarily transitive? But if we state (B, A) and (C, B), then we don't need (C, A) because if C occurs, then B must have occurred (so by (B, A) we know A must have occurred)? But the Log Skeleton does not automatically compose constraints? So we must state every pair? 

        Actually, the Log Skeleton is a set of constraints that must hold independently. So we must state (C, A) explicitly? 

        However, the problem does not specify the exact constraints. We can choose to state only the immediate predecessors? 

        But note: the constraint "Always Before" is global: if activity X occurs, then activity Y must have occurred at some point before. So if we have a chain, we must state every pair? 

        Example: if we have A then B then C. Then for C, we require both A and B? So we state (C, A) and (C, B). Similarly, for B, we state (B, A). 

        So we do:

        always_before = {
            ('CA','RO'),
            ('RI','RO'), ('RI','CA'),
            ('PI','RO'), ('PI','CA'), ('PI','RI'),
            ('QC','RO'), ('QC','CA'), ('QC','RI'), ('QC','PI'),
            ('PO','RO'), ('PO','CA'), ('PO','RI'), ('PO','PI'), ('PO','QC'),
            ('GSL','RO'), ('GSL','CA'), ('GSL','RI'), ('GSL','PI'), ('GSL','QC'), ('GSL','PO'),
            ('D','RO'), ('D','CA'), ('D','RI'), ('D','PI'), ('D','QC'), ('D','PO'), ('D','GSL'),
            ('IC','RO'), ('IC','CA'), ('IC','RI'), ('IC','PI'), ('IC','QC'), ('IC','PO'), ('IC','GSL'), ('IC','D'),
            ('RP','RO'), ... and so on until ('RP','IC')
        }

        That's a lot. Alternatively, we can note that the process is linear and we can state the immediate predecessor? But the constraint is not about immediate predecessor but about any time before. 

        However, the Log Skeleton also has "directly_follows" constraints for immediate succession.

        But note: the problem says "Directly-Follows Constraints: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after." 

        So we can use:

        directly_follows = {
            (RO, CA),
            (CA, RI),
            (RI, PI),
            (PI, QC),
            (QC, PO),
            (PO, GSL),
            (GSL, D),
            (D, IC),
            (IC, RP)
        }

        And then we don't need to state all the always_before pairs? Because the directly_follows constraints and the fact that each activity occurs exactly once would enforce the order? 

        However, note: the always_before constraints are still needed? Because if we only have directly_follows, then we know that after RO we have CA immediately, and after CA we have RI immediately, etc. But what if there is an activity that is not directly after but must be before? The directly_follows constraints do not enforce that, for example, RO is before PI? They only enforce that after RO comes CA, and after CA comes RI, and after RI comes PI. So by transitivity, RO is before PI? But the Log Skeleton constraints are independent? 

        Actually, the Log Skeleton is a set of independent constraints. So we must enforce the partial order via always_before? 

        However, note: the directly_follows constraints might be used to enforce a chain. But if we have a chain: A directly followed by B, and B directly followed by C, then we know A must be before C? But the Log Skeleton does not automatically infer that? 

        Therefore, we must still state the always_before constraints for every pair? 

        Alternatively, we can rely on the directly_follows chain and the fact that each activity occurs once? Then the chain would enforce the order? 

        But note: the always_before constraint is still needed? Because if we don't have (C, A) in always_before, then the model would allow C to occur without A? 

        However, the directly_follows constraint (A,B) implies that if A occurs then B must occur immediately after? But it doesn't say anything about the occurrence of A? And if we have (B,C) then if B occurs then C must occur immediately after? 

        Now, if we have a case that does RO and then PI? That would violate the directly_follows? Because after RO we must have CA? 

        But note: the directly_follows constraint (RO, CA) says: if RO occurs, then CA must occur immediately after? So if RO occurs and then PI occurs, that violates (RO, CA) because after RO we don't have CA? 

        Similarly, (CA, RI) says: if CA occurs then RI must occur immediately after? 

        So if we have the chain of directly_follows, then we enforce the entire sequence? 

        Therefore, we might not need the always_before? 

        However, the problem says: "The Log Skeleton is expressed as a Python dictionary containing the keys: ...". We must provide all keys? 

        And note: the always_before constraint is a separate constraint. We can choose to not use it? But the process requires that, for example, RO must be before PI? And that is enforced by the chain? 

        But what if there is a gap? For example, if we have RO, then CA, then ... and then PI? The directly_follows constraint (CA, RI) would require that after CA we have RI? So we cannot have RO, CA, then PI? Because after CA we must have RI? 

        Therefore, the chain of directly_follows constraints enforces the entire sequence? 

        So we can avoid listing all always_before pairs? 

        However, the problem does not say we must avoid redundancy? We can choose to include the always_before constraints? Or we can choose to rely on directly_follows? 

        But note: the Log Skeleton model uses both. And the always_before constraint is more general: it doesn't require immediacy. 

        Since the process is sequential and we have the directly_follows chain, we can omit the always_before? Or we can include a minimal set? 

        Actually, the always_before constraint can be used to enforce the order between non consecutive activities? But the directly_follows chain already forces the entire sequence? 

        Therefore, we can set always_before to the empty set? 

        But wait: what if an activity is skipped? For example, if we do RO, then CA, then RI, then PI, then QC, then PO, then GSL, then D, then IC, then RP: that's the happy path. 

        But what if we skip an activity? The directly_follows constraint would be violated? 

        For example, if we skip RI: RO, CA, then PI? Then (CA, RI) is violated because after CA we did not have RI? 

        So the directly_follows constraints enforce that the next activity is the specified one? 

        Therefore, we don't need always_between? 

        However, note: the always_before constraint is still needed for activities that are not consecutive? For example, if we have two parallel branches? But in this process, we don't have parallelism? 

        So we can set:

        always_before = set()   # because the directly_follows chain enforces the order?

        But wait: the always_before constraint is also used to enforce that an activity must have occurred at some point (not necessarily immediately) before? In a chain, if we have A then B then C, then we know A is before C? But the Log Skeleton does not infer that from the directly_follows? 

        Actually, the Log Skeleton constraints are independent. So if we want to enforce that RO must occur before D, we have to state (D, RO) in always_before? 

        Therefore, to be safe, we should include the always_before pairs? 

        But note: the problem says "complex", but without loops or parallel branches, we can rely on the chain? 

        However, the Log Skeleton model does not have built-in transitivity? So we must state all the always_before pairs? 

        Given the complexity of writing 45 pairs (for 10 activities, 10*9/2=45 pairs? Actually, for each pair (i,j) with i>j, we have one constraint) we might do:

        activities = ['RO','CA','RI','PI','QC','PO','GSL','D','IC','RP']
        always_before = set()
        for i in range(1, len(activities)):
            for j in range(0, i):
                always_before.add( (activities[i], activities[j]) )

        That gives 45 pairs? Actually, 9+8+...+1 = 45.

        But note: the constraint (CA, RO) is included? Yes.

        Alternatively, we can note that the process is linear and the directly_follows chain will enforce the same? But the Log Skeleton model uses both constraints? 

        Since the problem does not specify which constraints to use, we can choose to include the always_before? 

 3. Always After:
    - This is the opposite: if the first activity occurs, then the second activity must occur after? 
    - For example, if RO occurs, then CA must occur after? 
    - Similarly, if CA occurs, then RI must occur after? 

    But note: the chain of directly_follows constraints already enforces that? 

    However, we can define:

        always_after = set()
        for j in range(0, len(activities)-1):
            for i in range(j+1, len(activities)):
                # if the first activity (activities[j]) occurs, then the second (activities[i]) must occur after?
                # but the constraint says: if the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events.
                # So we want: (activities[j], activities[i])
                always_after.add( (activities[j], activities[i]) )

        That would be 45 pairs again? 

        But note: the constraint is: if the first activity occurs, then the second activity must occur after? 

        So for RO, we require that CA, RI, PI, ... RP occur after? 

        However, that is true? 

        But wait: if RO occurs, then we must have CA immediately after? And then RI? etc. So yes, all the rest must occur? 

        But note: the constraint does not require that the second activity must occur? It only says: if the first occurs and the second occurs, then the second must be after? Or does it say: if the first occurs then the second must occur?: ": ": "If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events." 

        This implies that the second activity must occur? 

        But in our process, every activity must occur? So we can set:

        For every pair (i, j) with i<j: 
            always_after.add( (activities[i], activities[j]) )   # meaning: if activities[i] occurs then activities[j] must occur after? 

        But note: the constraint also implies that activities[j] must occur? 

        However, we already set activ_freq to 1 for every activity? So every activity occurs? 

        Therefore, we can set always_after to the same 45 pairs? 

        But wait: if we set both always_before and always_after for the same pairs? 

        Example: for (RO, CA): 
            always_before: (CA, RO) -> if CA occurs then RO must have occurred before.
            always_after: (RO, CA) -> if RO occurs then CA must occur after.

        That is symmetric? 

        Actually, they are two different constraints.

        However, note: if we set activ_freq to 1 for every activity, then every activity occurs exactly once. Then:

            (CA, RO) in always_before: CA occurs -> RO must have occurred (which it does, and before) -> satisfied.
            (RO, CA) in always_after: RO occurs -> CA must occur after -> satisfied.

        So both are redundant? 

        But the Log Skeleton model allows to specify both? 

        Alternatively, we can avoid redundancy? 

        However, the problem does not specify. We can choose to set:

            always_before: for every pair (later, earlier) in the sequence.
            always_after: for every pair (earlier, later) in the sequence.

        And that covers the entire partial order? 

        But note: the directly_follows constraints are also there? 

        So we have:

            directly_follows: the immediate succession.

        And then:

            always_before: the full partial order (which in this case is total) for non-immediate pairs? 

        Actually, the directly_follows constraints are stronger: they enforce immediacy. 

        Therefore, we might not need the always_before and always_after? 

        But the problem says: "The Log Skeleton is expressed as a Python dictionary containing the keys: ...". We must provide all keys? 

        We can set:

            equivalence: set()   # no equivalence pairs? 
            always_before: the set of pairs (later, earlier) for every non-consecutive pair? 
            always_after: the set of pairs (earlier, later) for every non-consecutive pair? 
            never_together: set()   # no two activities that cannot occur together? 
            activ_freq: dictionary with each activity: {1}
            directly_follows: the consecutive pairs.

        But note: the always_before and always_after constraints are not only for non-consecutive? They are for any pair? 

        Actually, they are for any pair that are not consecutive? But consecutive pairs are covered by directly_follows? 

        However, the always_before constraint for consecutive pairs is also true? For example, (CA, RO) is consecutive? 

        So we can include consecutive pairs in always_before? 

        Therefore, we can set:

            always_before = set( (a, b) for a in activities for b in activities if a comes after b in the sequence? )

        Similarly for always_after.

        But note: the directly_follows constraint is stronger: it requires immediacy. So if we have (RO, CA) in directly_follows, then we know that after RO comes CA immediately. But we also have (CA, RO) in always_before? That is redundant? 

        However, the Log Skeleton model allows redundancy? 

        Alternatively, we can avoid including consecutive pairs in always_before and always_after? 

        But the problem does not specify. 

        Let me re-read: the Log Skeleton constraints are independent. So we can include:

            always_before: all pairs (X, Y) such that Y is before X in the sequence? 
            always_after: all pairs (X, Y) such that Y is after X in the sequence? 
            directly_follows: the consecutive pairs.

        That would be acceptable? 

        But note: the always_after constraint (RO, CA) is the same as the directly_follows constraint (RO, CA) in the sense that the directly_follows constraint implies the always_after? But the always_after constraint does not require immediacy? 

        Actually, the directly_follows constraint (RO, CA) says: if RO occurs then CA must occur immediately after. This implies that CA occurs after RO? So the always_after constraint (RO, CA) is redundant? 

        Similarly, the always_before constraint (CA, RO) is also implied? 

        Therefore, we can set:

            always_before = set()   # because the directly_follows chain and the fact that every activity occurs once enforces the order? 
            always_after = set()     # same reason.

        But wait: what if we skip an activity? Then the directly_follows constraint would be violated? 

        So we don't need always_before and always_after? 

        However, the problem says: "The Log Skeleton process model contains the following declarative constraints". It lists all. We must provide some? 

        Given the process, we can set:

            equivalence: none? 
            always_before: none? 
            always_after: none? 
            never_together: none? 
            activ_freq: each activity exactly once? 
            directly_follows: the consecutive pairs.

        But note: the problem says "complex order fulfillment", but without loops or choices, we can model with directly_follows and activ_freq.

        However, let me think about the quality check: what if it fails? Then we might have to re-pick? 

        The problem does not specify rework. So we assume the happy path? 

        But if we want to allow rework? Then:

            After QC, if it fails, we go back to PI? Then we have a loop: PI -> QC -> PI? 

        Then:

            activ_freq: 
                PI: {1,2}   # at least once, at most twice? 
                QC: {1,2}   # same? 

            And the directly_follows: 
                (PI, QC) and (QC, PI) ? 

            But note: the directly_follows constraint: if PI occurs, then the next must be QC? And if QC occurs and it fails, then the next must be PI? But if it passes, then the next must be PO? 

            So we cannot have a fixed directly_follows? 

        The problem does not specify rework. So we assume the happy path? 

        Therefore, we stick to the linear sequence.

 4. Never Together: 
    - We don't have any two activities that cannot occur together? Because every activity occurs once? 

 5. Activity Occurrences: 
    - We set each activity to {1}. 

 6. Directly-Follows Constraints:
    - We set the consecutive pairs: 
        ('RO','CA')
        ('CA','RI')
        ('RI','PI')
        ('PI','QC')
        ('QC','PO')
        ('PO','GSL')
        ('GSL','D')
        ('D','IC')
        ('IC','RP')

 But note: what about the end? After RP, there is nothing? 

 The directly_follows constraint: if the first activity occurs, then the second must occur immediately after? 

 For the last activity RP, there is no next? So we don't have any constraint that forces something after RP? 

 So it's okay.

 However, what if the process has multiple paths? The problem does not specify. 

 Given the above, we design:

   equivalence = set()
   always_before = set()   # we decide to omit because the directly_follows chain and activ_freq enforce the order? 
   always_after = set()    # same.
   never_together = set()
   activ_freq = {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
   }
   directly_follows = {
        ('RO','CA'),
        ('CA','RI'),
        ('RI','PI'),
        ('PI','QC'),
        ('QC','PO'),
        ('PO','GSL'),
        ('GSL','D'),
        ('D','IC'),
        ('IC','RP')
   }

 But wait: the problem says "complex", but without any deviations? 

 However, the problem does not specify any deviations. 

 Alternatively, we might consider that the process might have an option to cancel an order? But the problem doesn't mention cancellation. 

 Therefore, we go with the above.

 But note: the always_before and always_after constraints are empty? Is that acceptable? 

 The Log Skeleton model can have empty sets? 

 Yes.

 However, let me double-check the constraints:

   - If we have the activ_freq and directly_follows, then we enforce that every activity occurs exactly once and in the given consecutive order? 

   - So a trace must be: [RO, CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, RP]? 

   - That matches the scenario.

 Therefore, we write the dictionary.

 But note: the problem says "Log Skeleton" and we are allowed to use the constraints as we see fit? 

 However, the scenario might require more? 

 Let me think about the "Always Before" constraint: 

   The description says: "If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously."

   In our model, if we take D (Dispatch), then RO must have been executed previously? 

   But we don't have (D, RO) in always_before? 

   How is that enforced? 

   It is enforced by the directly_follows chain? Because to have D, we must have GSL immediately before? And to have GSL, we must have PO immediately before? ... until RO? 

   So if D occurs, then RO must have occurred? 

   But note: the directly_follows constraint does not say that? It says that after RO comes CA, then RI, etc. But if we skip RO? Then we cannot have CA? Because the directly_follows constraint (RO, CA) says: if RO occurs then CA must occur immediately after? But if RO does not occur? Then the constraint (RO, CA) is not triggered? 

   However, we have activ_freq: RO must occur exactly once? So RO must occur? 

   Then the chain: RO must be followed by CA? Then CA must be followed by RI? ... until D? 

   So we get the entire sequence? 

   Therefore, we don't need the always_before? 

   Similarly, for always_after: if RO occurs, then CA must occur after? This is enforced by the directly_follows (RO, CA) and the fact that CA must occur? 

   So we are safe.

 Final decision:

   We set:
      equivalence = set()
      always_before = set()
      always_after = set()
      never_together = set()
      activ_freq = { 
          'RO': {1}, 
          'CA': {1},
          'RI': {1},
          'PI': {1},
          'QC': {1},
          'PO': {1},
          'GSL': {1},
          'D': {1},
          'IC': {1},
          'RP': {1}
      }
      directly_follows = { 
          ('RO','CA'),
          ('CA','RI'),
          ('RI','PI'),
          ('PI','QC'),
          ('QC','PO'),
          ('PO','GSL'),
          ('GSL','D'),
          ('D','IC'),
          ('IC','RP')
      }

 But note: the directly_follows constraint for the last activity? We don't have any constraint that forces something after RP? So it's okay.

 However, what if there is an activity that occurs after RP? We don't have any, and activ_freq says each activity once? So no extra activities.

 Therefore, we write the dictionary.

 But note: the problem says "complex", but we are modeling the happy path? 

 Since the problem does not specify any variations, we model the happy path.

 If we were to allow rework, we would have to change. But the problem does not mention.

 Let's code accordingly.
</think>
Based on the order fulfillment process described, the Log Skeleton model is constructed as follows. The process follows a strict linear sequence where each activity occurs exactly once per case, and the directly-follows constraints enforce the immediate succession of activities. No equivalence, always-before, always-after, or never-together constraints are needed, as the combination of activity occurrences and directly-follows constraints fully captures the process flow.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': set(),
    'always_after': set(),
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},   # Receive Order occurs exactly once
        'CA': {1},   # Check Availability occurs exactly once
        'RI': {1},   # Reserve Items occurs exactly once
        'PI': {1},   # Pick Items occurs exactly once
        'QC': {1},   # Quality Check occurs exactly once
        'PO': {1},   # Pack Order occurs exactly once
        'GSL': {1},  # Generate Shipping Label occurs exactly once
        'D': {1},    # Dispatch occurs exactly once
        'IC': {1},   # Invoice Customer occurs exactly once
        'RP': {1}    # Record Payment occurs exactly once
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive Order must be immediately followed by Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability must be immediately followed by Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items must be immediately followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick Items must be immediately followed by Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check must be immediately followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Pack Order must be immediately followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),  # Generate Shipping Label must be immediately followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),   # Dispatch must be immediately followed by Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')   # Invoice Customer must be immediately followed by Record Payment
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`activ_freq`**: Each activity is constrained to occur exactly once per case, ensuring all steps are executed without repetition.
- **`directly_follows`**: Enforces the immediate sequence of activities (e.g., after "Receive Order", "Check Availability" must be the next activity).
- **Empty constraints**: `equivalence`, `always_before`, `always_after`, and `never_together` are empty sets because:
  - No activities have equivalent occurrence patterns beyond what is already enforced by `activ_freq`.
  - The linear sequence (enforced by `directly_follows` and `activ_freq`) implies temporal dependencies, making explicit `always_before`/`always_after` redundant.
  - All activities co-occur in every case, so `never_together` is not applicable. 

This model ensures that every order follows the sequence:  
`RO`  `CA`  `RI`  `PI`  `QC`  `PO`  `GSL`  `D`  `IC`  `RP` with no deviations, skips, or repetitions.
