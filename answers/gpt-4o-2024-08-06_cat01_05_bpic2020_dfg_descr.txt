The data you have represents a process flow often used in financial or expense-related approvals, such as expense reimbursement or invoice payments. We can identify several key stages and transitions within this process based on the events and their frequencies and performance metrics (i.e., the time taken at each stage).

1. **Initiation and Submission:**
   - The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE). This declaration can take several paths, depending on the organization's internal control and approval requirements.

2. **Review and Approval Pathways:**
   - Once submitted, the declaration might be reviewed by different entities, namely:
     - **Administration:** Directly leading to either final approval or rejection, or proceeding to another layer of approval.
     - **Budget Owner:** Possibly required for financial approval, especially if budget constraints are involved.
     - **Pre-Approver:** An intermediary step that could be necessary before final supervisory approval.
     - **Supervisor:** Ultimately grants final approval before processing payment.

3. **Rejection Pathways:**
   - At any stage, the declaration can be rejected by the respective authority, which typically results in it being sent back to the employee for modifications or dismissal.
   - Specific rejection transitions include:
     - By Administration, Pre-Approver, Budget Owner, or Supervisor, with each leading back to employee action or further review steps.
   - Rejections can also loop back to earlier stages (Declaration REJECTED by X -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

4. **Approval to Payment:**
   - Once a declaration reaches the "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" stage, it triggers the payment request (Request Payment), which then leads to "Payment Handled".
   - There are high frequencies observed in the transition from final approval to payment handling, indicating a standard flow for successfully approved declarations.

5. **Edge Cases and Anomalies:**
   - A few low-frequency events involve steps like "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by Y" or transitions directly involving "REJECTED by MISSING", possibly representing exceptions, testing cases, or manual interventions.

6. **Performance Metrics:**
   - The performance numbers attached to each transition provide insights into the average time taken at different steps, with notable delays (high performance values) at some rejection points and in specific routing (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED).

The process flow described reflects typical approval hierarchies in organizational financial processes, including multi-level approvals, checks, rejections, and final settlement stages, capturing both the normal operating procedures and exceptions or outlier scenarios.
