Here is the original DECLARE model with new bias-mitigating constraints introduced clearly in Python dictionary augmented such that they carefully limit process bias and discrimination based on sensitive applicant attributes.

### Explanation of Added Bias-Mitigating Constraints:

#### 1. Existence Constraints:
- **BiasMitigationCheck** and **ManualReview**:  
  Ensures that the process includes explicit steps aimed to mitigate bias. Such steps must explicitly occur within the traces, establishing a concrete trace element for anti-bias actions.

#### 2. Responded Existence Constraints:
- When sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender, or age) are explicitly checked, it must be accompanied by a **BiasMitigationCheck**. This ensures that whenever potentially bias-inducing sensitive attributes are examined, at least one mitigating step occurs along with it, preventing discriminatory decisions based purely on sensitive attributes.

#### 3. Coexistence Constraints:
- Specifically imposes that for certain sensitive decisions (**Reject_Minority**, **Approve_Minority**) a **ManualReview** activity must coexist in the same process trace. This ensures manual oversight and fairness checks in responses involving protected or minority groups, reducing unconscious or systematic biases.

#### 4. Response and Precedence Constraints:
- Specifically establishes that whenever sensitive attributes (**CheckApplicantRace**, **CheckApplicantGender**, **CheckApplicantAge**) are used, **BiasMitigationCheck** must immediately follow it or precede a sensitive final decision (**Reject_Minority**, **Approve_Minority**, **FinalDecision**). This sequential constraint ensures that a bias mitigation step will always intervene between sensitive attribute usage and a final decision, reducing the probability of biased decisions.

#### 5. Non-succession Constraints:
- Clearly forbids immediate direct succession between checking of sensitive attributes and making final approval/rejection decisions (**Reject**, **Approve**). This avoids immediate outcomes influenced solely by demographic-sensitive information, requiring intermediate steps that explicitly counter bias before the final decision can occur.

### How these Constraints Reduce Bias:

The newly inserted constraints explicitly structure the order and coexistence of activities, effectively ensuring fairness checks are interposed whenever sensitive attributes might influence decision-making. They strictly mandate manual or bias mitigation reviews within critical decision stages, forbidding direct sensitive attribute-to-decision occurrences. Consequently, this significantly reduces the likelihood of biased outcomes and ensures compliance with fairness standards, thus making the loan application process fairer and accountable.
