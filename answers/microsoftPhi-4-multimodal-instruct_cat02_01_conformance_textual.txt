1. Case Violations:

- Case 1: Violates the norm by authorizing payment before checking inventory.
- Case 2: Violates the norm by authorizing payment before packaging and before checking inventory.
- Case 3: Violates the norm by shipping the order before it was canceled.
- Case 4: Could be considered ambiguous, but it does not violate the normative process as described since the items have not been authorized for payment before checking the inventory.

2. Explanation referencing the normative process:

- Case 1: The normative process requires that "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging. However, in Case 1, "Authorize payment" occurred before "Check inventory," which is a violation of the process.

- Case 2: According to the normative process description, "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" has happened. In Case 2, the activity "Package items" preceded the authorization of payment, which is against the normative process. Additionally, the process should go from "Receive order" to "Check inventory" before other activities, which was respected in this case.

- Case 3: The norm clearly states that if the inventory check reveals not enough stock, the process should proceed to "Cancel order" and never to "Ship order". In Case 3, "Ship order" was initiated before "Cancel order" was completed, which violates the normative process. Shipping before cancellation is not allowed because it contradicts the intended flow where the order should either be shipped or canceled depending on the inventory check, but not both.

- Case 4: This case does not explicitly violate the normative process since there's no record of payment being authorized before the inventory check. The process follows the correct sequence with "Receive order" followed by "Check inventory," then "Check inventory" leads directly to "Cancel order" because it's the only recorded activity after the check. "Close order" is the last activity. However, due to the ambiguity that exists when the responsible person may skip steps under exceptional circumstances (as mentioned in the normative process description), Case 4 could potentially be seen as ambiguous in the interpretation without additional information. There is no direct violation, but it's important to note that the normative process should ideally include a step that ensures payment authorization before proceeding to cancellation, even if it's not recorded here. This might suggest an incomplete documentation of the case. It would be worth investigating whether Case 4 was accounted for under exceptional circumstances as loosely referenced in the normative process description.
