## Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc. using Process Mining

Precision Parts Inc.'s challenges are characteristic of high-mix, low-volume job shops operating with insufficient scheduling sophistication. The available MES event logs offer a rich, untapped resource for understanding the actual production dynamics and devising data-driven solutions. As a Senior Operations Analyst, my approach will leverage process mining to diagnose current issues and inform the development of advanced, adaptive scheduling strategies.

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

Process mining provides the tools to transform the raw MES event logs into actionable insights by revealing the true process flow and performance.

**Reconstructing and Analyzing Job Flow:**

*   **Case Identification:** Each `Case ID (Job ID)` in the log represents a distinct instance of a job order.
*   **Activity Sequence:** For each case, the `Timestamp`, `Event Type` (specifically `Task` events with `Task Start` and `Task End`), and `Activity/Task` allow us to reconstruct the ordered sequence of operations performed for that job.
*   **Resource Allocation:** The `Resource (Machine ID)` links activities to the specific machine used, enabling us to track which jobs flowed through which resources.
*   **Process Discovery:** Using process mining algorithms (e.g., Alpha Miner, Heuristic Miner, Inductive Miner), we can automatically discover and visualize the actual process maps for different job types or families (if routings are somewhat similar) or even the overall shop floor flow. This reveals common paths, variations in routings, and rework loops if present.

**Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:**

*   **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan:**
    *   **Technique:** Trace analysis. For each `Case ID`, calculate the duration between the first `Job Released` event and the final `Task End` event (assuming there's a final "Job Completed" equivalent event, or inferring completion from the last task).
    *   **Metric:** Mean, median, and distribution of `Total Flow Time` (Job Released to last Task End), `Lead Time` (time from order placement/release to delivery – if delivery is logged), and `Makespan` (time from the first operation start to the last operation end across all jobs in a defined period). Analyzing distributions is crucial to understand variability.
*   **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
    *   **Technique:** Resource/Queue analysis. Identify `Queue Entry` and `Task Start` events for each `Activity/Task` at a specific `Resource`.
    *   **Metric:** Calculate the duration between `Queue Entry` and `Task Start` for each task instance. Aggregate and analyze the mean, median, and distribution of `Queue Time` per `Resource` and per `Activity/Task`. This highlights where jobs spend significant time waiting.
*   **Resource Utilization:**
    *   **Technique:** Resource analysis, Time analysis.
    *   **Metric:**
        *   **Productive Time:** Sum of durations between `Task Start` and `Task End` for each `Resource`.
        *   **Setup Time:** Sum of durations between `Setup Start` and `Setup End` for each `Resource`.
        *   **Idle Time:** Total time in a period minus Productive Time, Setup Time, and planned downtime (if logged). Calculate `Utilization Percentage` (Productive Time + Setup Time / Total Time available). Analyze utilization per `Resource` to identify bottlenecks (high utilization) and underutilized resources.
*   **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
    *   **Technique:** Attribute analysis, Sequence analysis. Filter `Task Start` and `Task End` events on a specific `Resource`. For each `Setup Start` event, identify the `Previous job` mentioned in the `Notes` field (or infer it from the preceding `Task End` event on the same resource).
    *   **Metric:** Group `Setup Duration` (`Setup End` - `Setup Start`) by the pair of activities/jobs involved in the transition (e.g., `Activity X` on `JOB-A` followed by `Activity Y` on `JOB-B` on `Resource Z`). Calculate the average, median, and distribution of setup times for different transition pairs on each `Resource`. This directly quantifies the sequence dependency.
*   **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
    *   **Technique:** Case analysis, attribute comparison. For each `Case ID`, compare the actual completion time (inferred from the last `Task End` event) with the `Order Due Date`.
    *   **Metric:**
        *   `Tardiness`: Max(0, Actual Completion Time - Order Due Date).
        *   `On-Time Performance`: Percentage of jobs completed on or before their due date.
        *   Analyze the distribution of `Tardiness` to understand the severity of delays. Filter cases by `Order Priority` to see if high-priority jobs are meeting their deadlines.
*   **Impact of Disruptions:**
    *   **Technique:** Event analysis, Case analysis. Filter for `Breakdown Start` and `Priority Change` events.
    *   **Metric:** Analyze `Queue Times` and `Flow Times` for jobs that were on a `Resource` during a `Breakdown`. Compare `Flow Times` for jobs that experienced a `Priority Change` versus similar jobs that did not. Use correlation analysis to see if `Breakdown` frequency or duration correlates with increased `Tardiness` or `WIP`. Visualize the impact of these events on resource availability using resource calendars derived from the log.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Process mining insights provide empirical evidence for the underlying issues.

*   **Bottleneck Resources:** Resources with consistently high `Utilization Percentage` (especially productive and setup time), long and highly variable `Queue Times`, and which appear frequently in the paths of delayed jobs are likely bottlenecks. Process mining visualization can show queues backing up before these resources.
*   **Poor Task Prioritization:** Analyzing `Queue Time` distributions filtered by `Order Priority` and `Order Due Date` will reveal if high-priority or near-due date jobs are spending significant time waiting behind lower-priority jobs or those with distant due dates. `Variant Analysis` comparing the event sequences of on-time jobs vs. late jobs might show that late jobs were consistently processed later than their priority or due date would suggest, perhaps due to being stuck behind a less critical job that was processed earlier due to a local dispatching rule (e.g., FCFS).
*   **Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Times:** Analyzing the `Sequence-Dependent Setup Time` matrix derived in step 1 will quantify the penalty associated with specific job transitions on key resources. If process analysis shows frequent, costly transitions on bottleneck machines, it indicates poor sequencing decisions that inflate non-productive time. Analyzing the sequence of jobs processed on a machine and comparing the actual setup time to the expected sequence-dependent setup time (if a model exists or can be built from the data) will highlight inefficiencies.
*   **Starvation of Downstream Resources:** By analyzing the flow between resources, process mining can identify instances where a resource is idle even though there are jobs waiting for its processing *downstream* of an upstream bottleneck. This would be evident in `Resource Utilization` data showing idle time on a resource while `Queue Time` is high at an upstream resource feeding it.
*   **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:** Analyzing the number of cases in `Queue Entry` status across different resources over time will reveal the WIP levels. If the WIP fluctuates significantly and unpredictably, it can indicate a bullwhip effect, potentially caused by variability introduced by upstream scheduling decisions or disruptions propagating through the system.

**Providing Evidence with Process Mining:**

*   **Performance Dashboards:** Create dashboards summarizing key metrics (average flow times per job type, queue times per resource, resource utilization, tardiness per priority).
*   **Process Maps with Performance Overlays:** Visualize process maps colored by average `Queue Time` or `Flow Time` per activity/resource.
*   **Resource Calendars:** Show resource activity over time, highlighting productive time, setup, idle time, and breakdowns.
*   **Variant Analysis:** Compare process variants (sequences of activities) for on-time vs. late jobs. Identify patterns in the late variants (e.g., longer queue times at specific resources, encountering specific setup sequences, being impacted by breakdowns).
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Analyze correlations between metrics like queue time at resource A and queue time/start time at downstream resource B, or between setup times and the identity of the preceding job.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The diagnosed pathologies point towards deeper systemic issues.

*   **Limitations of Existing Static Dispatching Rules:** The current reliance on local dispatching rules (FCFS, EDD) is a primary root cause. These rules make decisions based *only* on the local queue, ignoring the overall shop floor state, downstream impact, sequence dependencies, and dynamic events. FCFS can lead to high-priority jobs being delayed. EDD is better for due dates but ignores setup times and resource constraints. A mix still lacks a holistic view. Process mining provides evidence by showing how jobs with higher priority or earlier due dates are overtaken by others in queues.
*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Decisions are made based on limited local information. The MES logs capture the state *after* events occur, but the *lack* of real-time visibility prevents proactive decision-making. This isn't directly seen in the logs but is inferred as a lack of *control* over the observed chaotic behavior.
*   **Inaccurate Task Duration or Setup Time Estimations:** The log provides both `Task Duration (Planned)` and `Task Duration (Actual)`, as well as actual `Setup Duration`. Comparing these reveals estimation accuracy. If actual durations are highly variable or consistently deviate from planned, it makes any static scheduling unpredictable. Process mining can quantify this variability and bias. If setup times are not estimated or considered at all, the sequence dependency is completely ignored.
*   **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** The log shows setups are happening, but the *scheduling logic* isn't proactively minimizing them. This is a direct consequence of static rules that don't consider the cost of transitioning between job types on a machine. Process mining quantifies the cost (time) of these transitions, providing evidence of the problem.
*   **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:** Static local rules optimize locally but can de-optimize globally. For example, processing a job quickly at an upstream resource might congest the queue at a downstream bottleneck. Process mining analysis of interconnected queues and resource utilization will show this lack of flow coordination.
*   **Inadequate Strategies for Responding to Disruptions:** The log shows `Breakdown Start` and `Priority Change` events. The *impact* on the schedule (increased delays, reshuffling leading to more setups) is evident in the performance metrics. The lack of a defined, data-driven response strategy leads to reactive chaos rather than planned adjustments.

**Process Mining for Root Cause Differentiation:**

*   **Poor Scheduling Logic vs. Resource Capacity:** High queue times at a resource with *low* utilization suggest poor scheduling (jobs are there but not being processed effectively). High queue times at a resource with *high* utilization strongly indicate a capacity limitation, regardless of the scheduling rule. Process mining metrics like `Queue Time` and `Utilization Percentage` are key here.
*   **Scheduling Issues vs. Process Variability:** High variability in task durations or setup times (quantified by process mining) is inherent process variability. If this variability makes *any* static schedule quickly obsolete, the root cause is the combination of variability *and* a scheduling system that cannot adapt. Process mining helps distinguish between variability *sources* (e.g., is it operator-dependent? material-dependent?) and the *impact* of that variability on schedule performance.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Based on the process mining insights, we can design more intelligent and adaptive scheduling approaches.

**Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**

*   **Core Logic:** Replace simple local rules with dynamic rules that evaluate multiple factors *in real-time* when a machine becomes available. The rule would select the next job from the queue based on a weighted combination of factors.
*   **Process Mining Data/Insights Used:**
    *   `Task Waiting Times` at the current resource: Favor jobs that have been waiting longest (like FCFS but weighted).
    *   `Order Due Date`: Prioritize jobs with earlier due dates (like EDD but weighted).
    *   `Order Priority`: Strongly favor high-priority jobs.
    *   `Task Duration (Estimated)`: Use median or historical distribution-derived estimates from process mining for similar tasks/jobs.
    *   `Sequence-Dependent Setup Time`: Use the matrix of historical setup times (derived in step 1) to estimate the setup time for processing each job in the queue *after* the currently processing or last processed job. This is a critical factor.
    *   `Downstream Machine Load/Queue Lengths`: Potentially consider the load on the *next* resource the job needs to go to. Process mining can track the current state of downstream queues.
*   **How it Addresses Pathologies:** Addresses poor prioritization (explicitly includes priority), improves schedule adherence (includes due date), and significantly tackles suboptimal sequencing (includes setup time penalty). It's dynamic as it reacts to the current queue state and resource availability.
*   **Expected Impact on KPIs:** Reduced tardiness (prioritizes due dates), potentially reduced WIP (if it helps maintain flow), improved utilization (minimizes setup time), more predictable lead times (decisions are more informed).

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Data-Driven Estimates**

*   **Core Logic:** Instead of relying on static or inaccurate planned durations, use historical process mining data to predict more realistic task durations and potential disruptions, enabling the creation of more robust and proactive schedules.
*   **Process Mining Data/Insights Used:**
    *   `Task Duration (Actual)` distributions: Analyze historical actual durations for different tasks, potentially segmenting by factors like `Operator ID`, `Job complexity` (if derivable), or `Material Type` (if logged). Use these distributions (e.g., mean, standard deviation, quantiles) instead of single planned values.
    *   `Sequence-Dependent Setup Time` distributions: Incorporate the variability of setup times learned from the log into predictions.
    *   `Breakdown Frequency` and `Duration` distributions: Analyze historical breakdown data per `Resource` to probabilistically model future breakdowns.
    *   Historical `Flow Time` patterns: Identify typical flow times for different job types.
*   **How it Addresses Pathologies:** Addresses unpredictable lead times and inefficient resource utilization by building schedules on more realistic timings. It proactively identifies potential bottlenecks and delays based on these predictions, allowing for earlier intervention.
*   **Expected Impact on KPIs:** Reduced tardiness (schedules are more achievable), more predictable lead times (better estimates), potentially improved utilization (if predictions help smooth flow). This strategy is often used in conjunction with simulation (see step 5).

**Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization Through Intelligent Sequencing/Batching**

*   **Core Logic:** On critical or bottleneck machines with significant sequence-dependent setups, implement specific logic to group similar jobs or sequence jobs to minimize total setup time over a shift or scheduling horizon. This might involve creating "batches" of jobs requiring similar setups.
*   **Process Mining Data/Insights Used:**
    *   `Sequence-Dependent Setup Time` matrix: This is the foundation. Identify the transitions with the highest setup penalties.
    *   Resource `Utilization`: Focus this strategy on bottleneck resources where setup time has the biggest impact on throughput.
    *   Historical `Flow Time` and `Queue Time` for jobs waiting at these bottleneck resources: Understand the pool of jobs available for sequencing/batching.
*   **How it Addresses Pathologies:** Directly addresses suboptimal sequencing and inefficient resource utilization caused by excessive setups. It can improve throughput at critical bottlenecks.
*   **Expected Impact on KPIs:** Increased throughput at bottleneck machines (reduces non-productive time), improved overall resource utilization, potentially reduced flow times for jobs passing through these resources, potentially reduced WIP (if the bottleneck flows faster). This strategy needs to be balanced with due date considerations, as waiting to form a batch might delay some urgent jobs. Process mining can help evaluate this trade-off.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

Deploying new scheduling strategies in a complex job shop without testing is risky. Discrete-event simulation is essential.

**Simulation Design and Parameterization:**

*   **Model Building:** Create a digital twin simulation model of the Precision Parts Inc. shop floor. Include:
    *   Workstations/Resources with their capacities and capabilities.
    *   Job arrival process (based on historical arrival rates and job type mix from the logs).
    *   Routing logic for different job types (derived from process maps).
    *   **Crucially, parameterize the model with distributions derived from process mining:**
        *   `Task Duration` distributions for each activity on each resource.
        *   `Sequence-Dependent Setup Time` matrix/distributions for relevant resources.
        *   `Breakdown Frequency` and `Duration` distributions for each resource.
        *   `Order Priority` and `Order Due Date` generation based on historical patterns.
*   **Testing Scenarios:**
    *   **Baseline Comparison:** Simulate the current scheduling logic (static dispatching rules) using the derived parameters to establish a baseline performance for comparison. This validates the simulation model against historical performance.
    *   **Proposed Strategies:** Simulate each proposed strategy (Enhanced Dispatching, Predictive, Setup Optimization, or combinations) under the same conditions.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Simulate under increased load (higher job arrival rates), increased breakdown frequency/duration, or a higher proportion of urgent jobs to evaluate strategy robustness.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Compare the simulation results across strategies and scenarios using the key KPIs: `Tardiness` (mean, max, percentage late), `WIP` (mean, peak), `Total Flow Time` (mean, distribution), `Resource Utilization` (productive, setup, idle), `Makespan`.

**Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:**

*   **Ongoing Process Mining:** The MES logs are continuously generated. Implement an automated process mining pipeline to regularly update the performance dashboards and metrics.
*   **Drift Detection:** Monitor key metrics for significant changes or deviations from expected performance under the chosen scheduling strategy. For example, if average queue times at a specific resource start climbing unexpectedly, or if tardiness for high-priority jobs increases.
*   **Adaptive Adjustment:**
    *   If performance metrics drift, use ongoing process mining to diagnose the *cause* of the drift (e.g., is it increased variability in task times? a change in job mix? more frequent breakdowns? the strategy is no longer optimal under current conditions?).
    *   Use the updated process mining data (e.g., new setup time patterns, updated task duration distributions) to recalibrate the parameters of the current scheduling strategy.
    *   If the drift is significant and persistent, use the simulation model (updated with recent data) to test alternative strategies or parameter settings before implementing changes on the shop floor.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop between the shop floor (operators, supervisors), the scheduling system, and the analytics team. Operators can provide context for unexpected events captured in the logs, aiding root cause analysis. The analytics team provides updated insights and refined scheduling logic.

By systematically applying process mining to analyze past performance, diagnose root causes, inform the design of data-driven scheduling strategies, and use simulation for rigorous testing and continuous monitoring, Precision Parts Inc. can move beyond reactive, inefficient scheduling towards a proactive, adaptive system that significantly improves their on-time performance, reduces WIP, and optimizes resource utilization. This approach leverages the power of their MES data to create a competitive advantage in a challenging job shop environment.
