Process cubes are a crucial concept in multi-dimensional process mining, which is an extension of traditional process mining that allows for more comprehensive and flexible analysis of business processes. Process cubes enable the aggregation and comparison of process data along multiple dimensions, providing a more nuanced understanding of process behavior and performance. Here's how they differ from traditional process mining approaches and their role in multi-dimensional process mining:

1. **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Traditional process mining techniques typically focus on a single process perspective, such as control-flow, time, or resources. In contrast, process cubes support multi-dimensional analysis, allowing users to analyze processes from various viewpoints simultaneously. This capability enables the identification of patterns, trends, and correlations that might be overlooked in single-dimensional analyses.

2. **Data aggregation and filtering**: Process cubes provide a structured way to aggregate and filter process data based on different dimensions. Users can create custom views of the data by selecting specific attributes and values, such as time periods, resources, or case types. This flexibility allows for targeted analysis and comparison of process performance across different segments.

3. **Comparative analysis**: Process cubes facilitate comparative analysis by enabling users to compare process performance and behavior across different dimensions. For instance, users can analyze how process performance varies between different departments, time periods, or product types. This capability helps identify best practices, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.

4. **Visualization and exploration**: Process cubes offer interactive visualization techniques that allow users to explore and analyze process data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. Users can drill down into specific data points, pivot between dimensions, and apply various filters to gain deeper insights into process behavior.

5. **Scalability and performance**: Process cubes are designed to handle large and complex datasets, making them suitable for analyzing real-world business processes. They leverage efficient data structures and algorithms to ensure fast query response times and support interactive data exploration.

6. **Integration with process mining techniques**: Process cubes can be integrated with traditional process mining techniques, such as process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis. By combining these techniques with process cubes, users can perform multi-dimensional process analysis and gain a more comprehensive understanding of their business processes.

In summary, process cubes play a vital role in multi-dimensional process mining by enabling users to analyze process data from various viewpoints, aggregate and filter data based on different dimensions, perform comparative analysis, and visualize and explore process behavior interactively.
