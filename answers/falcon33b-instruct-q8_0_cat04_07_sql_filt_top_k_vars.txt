To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of steps using DuckDB SQL commands. Here's a step-by-step breakdown and the SQL queries to achieve each task:

### Step 1: Extract the Ordered Sequence of Activities per Case

First, we need to order the events within each `case_id` by their `timestamp`. We can use the `PARTITION BY` clause combined with the `ORDER BY` clause for this.

```sql
SELECT
    case_id,
    (SELECT ARRAY(activity ORDER BY timestamp) 
     FROM event_log AS e2
     WHERE e1.case_id = e2.case_id
     ORDER BY e2.timestamp) as activity_sequence
FROM
    event_log AS e1
GROUP BY
    case_id
```
This query partitions the events by `case_id` and orders them by `timestamp`. The subquery returns an array of activities for each `case_id` in the order they occurred.

### Step 2: Identify Unique Process Variants

Next, we group the results by the ordered sequence of activities to identify unique process variants.

```sql
SELECT
    CASE_ID,
    ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            (SELECT ARRAY(activity ORDER BY timestamp) 
             FROM event_log AS e2
             WHERE e1.case_id = e2.case_id
             ORDER BY e2.timestamp) as activity_sequence
        FROM
            event_log AS e1
        GROUP BY
            case_id
    ) AS variant_events
GROUP BY
    CASE_ID,
    ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)
```
This query aggregates the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id`.

### Step 3: Count Cases per Variant and Determine Top K Variants

We'll count the number of cases per variant and then filter to get only those variants in the top K.

```sql
WITH variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        CASE_ID,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM
        (
            SELECT
                case_id,
                (SELECT ARRAY(activity ORDER BY timestamp) 
                 FROM event_log AS e2
                 WHERE e1.case_id = e2.case_id
                 ORDER BY e2.timestamp) as activity_sequence
            FROM
                event_log AS e1
            GROUP BY
                case_id
        ) AS variant_events
    GROUP BY
        CASE_ID,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    variant_counts
ORDER BY
    count DESC
LIMIT K; -- Replace K with the desired top variants count
```
This query first groups by case and ordered activities as in Step 1, then counts these groups. The final `SELECT` sorts the results by count in descending order and limits to the top K.

### Step 4: Return Corresponding Events from Top K Variants

Finally, we need to filter the original events log to include only those that belong to the cases part of the top K variants.

```sql
WITH ordered_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        (SELECT ARRAY(activity ORDER BY timestamp) 
         FROM event_log AS e2
         WHERE e1.case_id = e2.case_id
         ORDER BY e2.timestamp) as activity_sequence
    FROM
        event_log AS e1
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),
variants AS (
    SELECT
        CASE_ID,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM
        (
            SELECT
                case_id,
                (SELECT ARRAY(activity ORDER BY timestamp) 
                 FROM event_log AS e2
                 WHERE e1.case_id = e2.case_id
                 ORDER BY e2.timestamp) as activity_sequence
            FROM
                ordered_cases AS e1
        ) AS variant_events
    GROUP BY
        CASE_ID,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        variants
    ORDER BY
        count DESC
    LIMIT K -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id IN (SELECT CASE_ID FROM top_variants);
```
This series of queries accomplishes each task: it first orders events within each case, identifies unique sequences, counts them, selects the top K, and finally filters the original log to include only cases from those variants. Adjust `K` as needed for your requirements.
