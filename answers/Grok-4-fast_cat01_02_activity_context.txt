### Analysis of Recurring Activities

The event log shows the following activities recurring within the same case:
- **Verify Documents**: Appears twice in C001 and C003. The first occurrence is always an initial check of provided documents (e.g., identity verification post-initiation). The second is a follow-up re-check after an intervening action (e.g., document submission or account adjustment).
- **Call Customer**: Appears twice in C002. The first is an outbound call to address an issue (e.g., clarifying a discrepancy). The second is a follow-up to confirm resolution (e.g., after adjustments).

Other activities (e.g., Initiate Request, Approve Request, Submit Additional, Adjust Account) do not recur within any single case and thus require no renaming.

### Renaming Strategy
To disambiguate, I propose context-specific variants:
- For **Verify Documents**:
  - First occurrence → **Initial Document Verification** (reflects the starting check).
  - Second occurrence → **Follow-up Document Verification** (reflects re-checking after updates).
- For **Call Customer**:
  - First occurrence in C002 → **Clarification Customer Call** (targets issue resolution like discrepancies).
  - Second occurrence in C002 → **Confirmation Customer Call** (verifies post-adjustment outcomes).

These names preserve the original intent while incorporating positional and contextual cues (e.g., timestamps, resources, and descriptions) to highlight process flow stages.

### Justification of Naming Choices
- **Initial Document Verification** and **Follow-up Document Verification**: These distinguish the sequence—initial post-initiation (always first, tied to basic checks via resources like BackOfficeAgent/BranchOfficer) vs. follow-up after interventions (e.g., "now that ID scan is provided" in C001 or "after account adjustment" in C003). Positional order and explicit re-check language in contexts guided this split.
- **Clarification Customer Call** and **Confirmation Customer Call**: In C002, the first call addresses an open issue ("clarify account discrepancy"), while the second validates closure ("confirm adjustments made"). Timestamps show tight sequencing around Adjust Account, with resource consistency (FrontlineAgent) emphasizing escalation/resolution flow. Single-case recurrence kept names specific to this instance's cues.
