Normative Hire-to-Retire “happy-path” (simplified)

1. Post Job Advertisement  
2. Screen Candidates (CV / pre-selection)  
3. Conduct Interviews  
4. Make Hiring Decision  
5. Onboard Employee  
6. Add Employee to Payroll  
7. Close Case  

Any reasonable model should at least guarantee  

• Interviews precede the hiring decision  
• Screening precedes interviews and the decision  
• On-boarding precedes payroll, payroll precedes case closing  
• The case may only be closed after every mandatory step that creates a lasting obligation (on-boarding, payroll) has finished.

Analysis of POWL Model 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Edges that are fixed:  
Post  Screen  
Screen  Decide and Screen  Interview (parallel branch)  
Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  

What can still happen (because NO edge forbids it)

A1  Decide before Interviews  
Nothing forces Interview  Decide, therefore the hiring decision can be taken without ever talking to the candidates.  
(severe – violates the essence of the process)

A2  Close Case before Interviews  
Interview is not ordered w.r.t. Payroll or Close.  
The case may be closed while interviews are still running or even before they start.  
(severe – leaves work unfinished)

A3  Interviews after On-boarding / Payroll  
Same missing order; a candidate can be put on the payroll and only then be interviewed.  
(severe)

A4  Screening after Interview is impossible  
Here Screening is correctly fixed before Interview/Decide, so this part is fine.

Overall, Model 1 misses several critical precedence constraints and therefore allows highly implausible and risky executions.

Analysis of POWL Model 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed edges  

Post  ScreenPost  Interview (parallel)  
Interview  Decide  
Decide  Loop(Onboard …)  
Loop(Onboard)  XOR(Payroll, skip)  
XOR  Close  

Structures introduced  

• Loop(Onboard, skip) – On-boarding is executed at least once; it can be repeated (e.g., several orientation sessions).  
• XOR(Payroll, skip) – Payroll can be executed or silently skipped.  

Anomalies

B1  Screening may happen after Interview (because only Post  Screen, Post  Interview).  
– medium severity: not ideal but screening could still finish before the decision due to Interview  Decide constraint.

B2  Payroll is optional (XOR with skip).  
– medium severity: forgetting payroll is a financial / compliance risk, but the model still lets you add payroll when required.

B3  Multiple On-boarding cycles possible.  
– low severity: usually harmless; might even model reality (extra training days).

Crucially, the hard business rules are preserved:

• Interview precedes Decision (Interview  Decide)  
• Decision precedes any On-boarding / Payroll / Close  
• Close can only happen after the (possible) Payroll step.  
No trace can close the case before the hire decision or before at least one on-boarding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Which model is closer to the normative process?

Model 2 is clearly closer.

Reasoning  

1. Model 1 allows the most fundamental violation: deciding and even closing the case before interviews are finished (or even started).  
2. Model 2 keeps the essential causal chain Interview  Decision  On-board  ( Payroll | skip )  Close intact.  
3. The remaining deviations in Model 2 (screening order, optional payroll, loop on-boarding) are refinements or omissions that can be fixed with minor changes; they do not overturn the basic process logic.  
4. The deviations in Model 1 undermine the very purpose of hiring and create traces that would never be acceptable in practice.

Therefore, Model 2 aligns more closely with a correct Hire-to-Retire workflow, whereas Model 1 contains severe control-flow anomalies that compromise process integrity.
