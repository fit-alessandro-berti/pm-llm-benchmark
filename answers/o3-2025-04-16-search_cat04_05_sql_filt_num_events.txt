Here is a concise DuckDB query that does exactly what you described:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    -- 1. Count the events in each case
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS num_events
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6          -- 2. Keep only the cases with  6 events
)

-- 3. Return all events that belong to those qualifying cases
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN case_counts AS c USING (case_id);
```

Explanation of the steps:

1. The CTE `case_counts` calculates `COUNT(*)` per `case_id`.
2. `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` filters out any case that has more than six events.
3. A simple inner join (`USING (case_id)`) brings back all event rows whose `case_id` survived the filter, yielding the complete set of events for cases with six or fewer events.
