Here are the opposite concepts, more general concepts, and explanations for each of the given concepts in the process mining field:

1. **Automated Process Discovery**
	* Opposite concept: **Manual Process Discovery** (i.e., discovering processes through manual observation, interviews, and documentation analysis)
	* More general concept: **Process Identification** (encompassing both automated and manual approaches to identify and define business processes)
2. **Predictive Monitoring**
	* Opposite concept: **Reactive Monitoring** (i.e., monitoring processes after an issue has occurred, rather than predicting and preventing issues)
	* More general concept: **Process Surveillance** (encompassing both predictive and reactive approaches to monitoring and overseeing business processes)
3. **Bottom-up Discovery**
	* Opposite concept: **Top-down Discovery** (i.e., starting with high-level process models and decomposing them into more detailed processes)
	* More general concept: **Process Exploration** (encompassing both bottom-up and top-down approaches to discovering and understanding business processes)
4. **Process Simulation**
	* Opposite concept: **Process Execution** (i.e., actually executing and running business processes, rather than simulating them)
	* More general concept: **Process Analysis** (encompassing both simulation and execution, as well as other analytical approaches to understanding business processes)
5. **Process Efficiency**
	* Opposite concept: **Process Inefficiency** (i.e., the presence of waste, delays, or unnecessary steps in business processes)
	* More general concept: **Process Performance** (encompassing both efficiency and inefficiency, as well as other aspects of process performance, such as effectiveness and quality)
6. **Real-time Monitoring**
	* Opposite concept: **Offline Monitoring** (i.e., monitoring processes after the fact, rather than in real-time)
	* More general concept: **Process Observation** (encompassing both real-time and offline approaches to monitoring and observing business processes)

Note that these opposite and more general concepts are not mutually exclusive, and some may overlap or be related to each other in complex ways.
