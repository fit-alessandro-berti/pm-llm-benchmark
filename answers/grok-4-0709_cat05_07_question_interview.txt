Below is a list of targeted, open-ended questions I would ask the interviewee to deepen my conceptual understanding of the property onboarding process. These questions are designed to uncover missing details (e.g., overlooked steps or dependencies), explore decision criteria (e.g., how choices are made), clarify roles and responsibilities (e.g., who does what and why), verify timing and sequencing (e.g., durations, overlaps, or prerequisites), and learn about exceptions (e.g., how variations or challenges are managed). I've grouped them loosely by process stage for clarity, but they could be asked in any order during the conversation.

### Initial Contact and Documentation Review
1. Can you walk me through what typically happens if a landlord's documentation is incomplete or outdated—how do you prioritize which updates are critical, and who else gets involved in that decision?
2. What kinds of property details are most important to capture in the central database, and how do you ensure that the information is accurate and complete before moving forward?

### Assigning and Introducing the Property Manager
3. When assigning a property manager, how do you weigh factors like workload, geographic specialization, and experience—could you give an example of a scenario where one factor might override others?
4. During the introductory meeting between the property manager and landlord, what are some common special conditions or policies that come up, and how are disagreements about them typically resolved?

### Inspection, Repairs, and Marketing
5. How does the property manager coordinate with photographers and inspectors in terms of scheduling and follow-up—what challenges arise if the property is in a remote location or has access restrictions?
6. If the inspector's report identifies issues, how do you decide whether to involve contractors or let the landlord handle repairs, and what timelines do you aim for to keep the process moving?
7. What market trends or data sources does the digital marketing team use to update pricing models, and how often do these influence changes to the expected rental price range?

### Activation, Tenant Screening, and Lease Finalization
8. Once the property is activated in the rental portal, how do you manage the flow of tenant applications— for instance, what criteria guide the prioritization of applicants when there are multiple interested parties?
9. In cases where lease negotiations involve promotional discounts or custom terms, how do you balance the landlord's preferences with the company's policies, and who has the final say?
10. Could you describe the steps involved in finalizing the lease agreement, including how security deposits are handled and what factors might delay scheduling a move-in date?

### Quality Checks, Audits, and Overall Process
11. During the quality checks and internal audits, what specific fair housing regulations or profitability targets are most commonly reviewed, and how do discrepancies get addressed if they're found late in the process?
12. How do you handle exceptions throughout the onboarding lifecycle, such as properties needing special insurance or landlords requesting custom lease clauses—what additional steps or stakeholders are typically involved?
13. Looking at the entire process from start to finish, what are the key dependencies or potential bottlenecks in sequencing the steps, and how do you track progress across regional offices, landlords, and internal teams?
14. In terms of timing, how long does the full onboarding process usually take from initial contact to tenant move-in, and what variations have you seen based on property type or location?
