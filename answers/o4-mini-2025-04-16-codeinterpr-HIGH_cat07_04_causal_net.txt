This picture is really two things in one:

1. On the left you have a little “toy” workflow or businessprocess model, with nine tasks (a through z) connected by arrows and small black circles (“gateways”):

   • Task a (“register request”) is the start.  From a three one-circle gateways fan out to  
     • b (“examine thoroughly”),  
     • c (“examine casually”) or  
     • d (“check ticket”).  

   That is an exclusive (XOR) split—exactly one of those three paths is taken.  

   • Each of b, c and d can either go forward to e (“decide”) or loop back to f (“reinitiate request”).  Again you can see single circles on those outgoing arrows, so each is an XOR-split (you either reinitiate or you move on).  

   • Whenever any of b/c/d does demand a re-initiation, it does so via f, and f then has an XOR-split of its own back into one of b, c or d.  That closes the little loop (“if you’re not happy, try another exam or check again”).  

   • Once you finally get to e (“decide”), you again have an XOR split: either pay compensation (g) or reject the request (h).  Those two then reconverge (XOR-join) into the single end task z (“end”).  

2. On the right (in the shaded box) is a legend of exactly what these little black circles mean when you put them on arrows that split or join:  

   – XOR-split: one black circle on each outgoing branch (exactly one branch taken)  
   – AND-split: two concentric circles on each outgoing branch (all branches taken in parallel)  
   – OR-split: three concentric circles on each outgoing branch (any non-empty combination of branches)  

   – XOR-join: one black circle on each incoming branch (you wait for exactly one)  
   – AND-join: two circles on each incoming branch (you wait for all)  
   – OR-join: three circles on each incoming branch (you wait for one or more)  

All of the gateways in the actual process on the left happen to use exactly one circle, so it’s all exclusive (XOR) choice and XOR-joins, and you can read left-to-right:

 register request  pick one review  examine or reinitiate  decide  pay or reject  end.
