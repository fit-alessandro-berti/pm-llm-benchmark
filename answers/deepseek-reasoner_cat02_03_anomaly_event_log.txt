### Anomalies Identified and Explanations:

1. **Case 1002: Out-of-Order Approvals and Premature Payment**  
   - **Anomaly**:  
     - The sequence skips the approval of the purchase requisition until *after* the purchase order (PO) is issued and payment is released.  
     - Payment is released (`Release Payment`) *before* goods are received (`Receive Goods`) and the invoice is matched to the PO (`Match Invoice to PO`).  
   - **Why Problematic**:  
     - **Approval bypass**: A PO should only be issued *after* the requisition is approved. Skipping approval risks unauthorized spending.  
     - **Premature payment**: Paying before verifying receipt of goods or matching the invoice to the PO violates the "three-way match" principle (PO, goods receipt, invoice). This could lead to overpayment, fraud, or paying for undelivered goods.  

2. **Case 1003: Payment Before Invoice and Goods Receipt**  
   - **Anomaly**:  
     - Payment is released (`Release Payment`) *before* the vendor invoice is received (`Vendor Invoice Received`) and goods are received (`Receive Goods`).  
     - Goods are received *after* payment and invoice receipt.  
   - **Why Problematic**:  
     - **Lack of validation**: Payment should occur only after confirming the goods match the PO and the invoice. Releasing payment first creates financial risk (e.g., paying for incorrect/inflated invoices or undelivered goods).  
     - **Process inversion**: Receiving goods after payment contradicts standard practice (goods are typically inspected before payment to ensure compliance with the PO).  

3. **Case 1004: Goods Received Before PO Issuance**  
   - **Anomaly**:  
     - Goods are received (`Receive Goods`) *before* the PO is issued (`Issue Purchase Order`).  
   - **Why Problematic**:  
     - **Unauthorized transaction**: A PO formalizes the agreement with the vendor. Receiving goods without a PO suggests a lack of oversight, potentially enabling uncontrolled spending or acceptance of unordered goods.  
     - **Matching failure**: Invoice matching (`Match Invoice to PO`) becomes impossible if the PO is created after goods are received, leading to reconciliation issues and potential disputes.

### Summary of Risks:  
- **Financial control violations**: Skipping approvals, payments without validation, and unordered goods erode financial safeguards.  
- **Fraud exposure**: Premature payments or unordered goods create opportunities for fraudulent activities.  
- **Operational inefficiency**: Out-of-sequence steps (e.g., late approvals, delayed goods receipt) disrupt audit trails and compliance.  

**Recommendation**: Investigate these cases for potential policy breaches, system errors, or training gaps in the P2P process.
