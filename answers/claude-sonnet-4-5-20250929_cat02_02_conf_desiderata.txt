# Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance

## Part 1: Normative Rule Violations (Strict Compliance Analysis)

### **Case 1: COMPLIANT **
**Sequence followed:**
1. Application Received (09:00)
2. Credit Check (09:30)
3. Risk Assessment (10:00)
4. Loan Decision - Approved (11:00)
5. Inform Applicant (13:00)
6. Finalize Documentation (13:30)
7. Close Case (14:00)

**Analysis:** This case perfectly adheres to all normative constraints. The sequence is correct, Credit Check precedes Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment precedes Loan Decision, the applicant is informed after the decision, and since the loan was approved, documentation was finalized before closing the case.

---

### **Case 2: MAJOR VIOLATIONS **

**Violation #1: Sequence Order Breach**
- **Issue:** Risk Assessment occurred at 08:20, BEFORE Credit Check at 09:00
- **Rule Violated:** "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment"
- **Severity:** Critical normative violation
- **Impact:** The risk cannot be properly assessed without first checking creditworthiness

**Violation #2: Contradictory Action**
- **Issue:** Finalize Documentation occurred at 10:00 after a Rejected loan decision
- **Rule Violated:** "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case"
- **Severity:** Critical normative violation
- **Impact:** Resources wasted on documentation that shouldn't exist for a rejected application; creates confusion and potential legal/compliance issues

**Summary for Case 2:** Two serious normative violations make this case non-compliant with the process rules.

### **Case 3: COMPLIANT **
**Sequence followed:**
1. Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00)
2. Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00)
3. Risk Assessment (2024-01-14 11:00)
4. Loan Decision - Approved (2024-01-14 12:00)
5. Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00)
6. Finalize Documentation (2024-01-17 09:00)
7. Close Case (2024-01-17 10:00)

**Analysis:** All mandatory activities are performed in the correct sequence. The ordering rules are respected, and since the loan was approved, documentation was properly finalized before closing.

---

## Part 2: Desiderata Compliance (Best Practices Analysis)

### **Case 1: OPTIMAL **
- **Credit Check Timing:** Completed 30 minutes after application (well within 24-hour recommendation)
- **Inform Applicant Timing:** Completed 2 hours after decision (well within 48-hour recommendation)
- **Follow-up Call:** Not explicitly shown in log, but given the compact timeline, may have been omitted from recording
- **Assessment:** Meets or exceeds all desiderata; exemplary execution

---

### **Case 2: NOT EVALUATED** (due to normative violations)
Since this case has critical normative violations, evaluating desiderata compliance is less meaningful. However, for completeness:
- The timing aspects cannot be properly assessed given the process was fundamentally flawed
- The case demonstrates poor process adherence overall

---

### **Case 3: SUBOPTIMAL BUT ACCEPTABLE **

**Desideratum Deviation #1: Delayed Credit Check**
- **Issue:** Credit Check performed 49 hours after Application Received (from Jan 12 09:00 to Jan 14 10:00)
- **Recommendation Violated:** Credit Check should occur within 24 hours
- **Severity:** Minor; this is a recommended practice, not a strict rule
- **Possible Justification:** 
  - Weekend intervened (Jan 13-14 could include non-business days)
  - High application volume
  - Required additional information from applicant
  - Staff availability constraints

**Desideratum Deviation #2: Delayed Applicant Notification**
- **Issue:** Applicant informed 75 hours after Loan Decision (from Jan 14 12:00 to Jan 16 15:00)
- **Recommendation Violated:** Inform applicant within 48 hours of decision
- **Severity:** Minor; recommended but not mandatory
- **Possible Justification:**
  - Intervening weekend
  - Difficulty reaching applicant
  - Administrative backlog
  - Coordination with documentation team

**Desideratum Deviation #3: Missing Follow-up Call**
- **Issue:** No Follow-up Call activity recorded
- **Recommendation Violated:** Encouraged to perform follow-up call before closing
- **Severity:** Very minor; explicitly stated as encouraged but not required
- **Possible Justification:**
  - Call may have occurred but wasn't logged as separate activity
  - Combined with "Inform Applicant" activity
  - Applicant declined need for follow-up
  - Alternative communication method used (email confirmation)

**Assessment for Case 3:** While the case is normatively compliant, it represents suboptimal performance against best practices. The delays suggest process inefficiencies or resource constraints, but do not constitute serious violations.

## Summary Table

| Case ID | Normative Compliance | Desiderata Compliance | Overall Assessment |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1       |  Fully Compliant   |  Optimal            | **Excellent** - Model case |
| 2       |  2 Major Violations | N/A                  | **Non-Compliant** - Requires investigation |
| 3       |  Fully Compliant   |  3 Minor Deviations | **Acceptable** - Room for improvement |

## Recommendations

### **For Case 2 (Immediate Action Required):**
1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate why activities occurred out of order
2. **Training:** Reinforce mandatory sequence with staff
3. **System Controls:** Implement workflow automation to prevent sequence violations
4. **Documentation Review:** Ensure rejected applications don't trigger documentation workflow

### **For Case 3 (Process Improvement):**
1. **Capacity Planning:** Address delays in credit check processing
2. **Communication Protocol:** Streamline applicant notification procedures
3. **Activity Logging:** Ensure all activities (including follow-up calls) are properly recorded
4. **Weekend Coverage:** Consider staffing adjustments for continuous processing

### **General:**
- Case 1 should be used as a template for training and process documentation
- Implement automated alerts when desiderata thresholds are approached
- Regular audits to catch normative violations early
