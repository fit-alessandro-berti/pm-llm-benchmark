### Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

#### Normative Process Summary:
1. **Normal Flow (Sufficient Inventory):**  
   Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order.
2. **Cancellation Flow (Insufficient Inventory):**  
   Receive order → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order.
3. **Key Constraints:**
   - "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".
   - "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order".
   - "Ship order" must occur after "Package items" and never after "Cancel order".
   - "Close order" must be the final activity in all cases.

#### Deviations in Event Log:

1. **Case 1:**
   - Sequence: Receive → Check → Authorize → Package → Ship → Close.
   - **Assessment:** Complies with the normative process (normal flow). No violations.

2. **Case 2:**
   - Sequence: Receive → Check → Package → Authorize → Ship → Close.
   - **Violations:**
     - "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".  
       *Violation:* "Package items" should only occur after payment authorization.
     - "Ship order" occurs after "Authorize payment" but without "Package items" in between.  
       *Violation:* "Ship order" must follow "Package items".

3. **Case 3:**
   - Sequence: Receive → Check → Authorize → Cancel → Ship → Close.
   - **Violations:**
     - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".  
       *Violation:* "Ship order" should never occur after cancellation (cancellation implies no fulfillment).
     - "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order".  
       *Ambiguity:* The normative description does not explicitly forbid authorizing payment before cancellation, but it is logically inconsistent (why authorize payment if inventory is insufficient?). This could be considered a violation of intent.

4. **Case 4:**
   - Sequence: Receive → Check → Cancel → Close.
   - **Assessment:** Complies with the normative process (cancellation flow). No violations.

5. **Case 5:**
   - Sequence: Receive → Check → Authorize → Ship → Close.
   - **Violations:**
     - Missing "Package items" before "Ship order".  
       *Violation:* "Ship order" cannot occur without "Package items" preceding it.
     - "Close order" is correct as the final step, but the sequence is incomplete.

#### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2:**  
  (1) "Package items" before "Authorize payment".  
  (2) "Ship order" without "Package items" in between.
- **Case 3:**  
  (1) "Ship order" after "Cancel order".  
  (2) "Authorize payment" before cancellation (logical inconsistency).
- **Case 5:**  
  (1) Missing "Package items" before "Ship order".

#### Correct Cases:
- Case 1 (normal flow) and Case 4 (cancellation flow) adhere to the normative process.
