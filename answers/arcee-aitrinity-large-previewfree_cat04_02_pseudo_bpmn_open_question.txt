Looking at the process as it stands, the main bottlenecks seem to be in the initial validation stages, especially when a request turns out to be custom and requires feasibility analysis, manager approval, and possible rework. To tackle this, the first step is to reduce the delay between receiving a request and knowing whether it's standard or custom—ideally, without waiting for a manual review.

One way to do this is to automate the "Check Request Type" gateway. Instead of relying solely on manual classification, predictive analytics could be applied: by analyzing historical data, the system could score incoming requests for the likelihood of being custom. If the score is high, the request could be automatically routed to the custom path, skipping unnecessary standard validations. For borderline cases, a lightweight initial check could confirm the classification before proceeding.

Once a request is classified, the next optimization point is in the validation and approval stages. For standard requests, the parallel checks (credit, inventory) could be moved earlier, even before classification, so that by the time the request type is known, these checks are already underway or complete. For custom requests, instead of waiting for a feasibility analysis to finish before any checks begin, certain checks (like inventory) could start in parallel, with the results held pending final approval.

Manager approval is another potential delay. Here, dynamic resource reallocation could help: if the system detects a high volume of custom requests or a bottleneck in approvals, it could automatically escalate to a secondary approver or even allow for pre-approved thresholds for certain request types or customers. Alternatively, a "fast track" could be introduced for repeat customers or low-risk customizations, bypassing the approval step entirely.

To further increase flexibility, a new subprocess could be added: "Request Pre-Processing and Analytics." This subprocess would run as soon as a request is received, using machine learning to flag likely custom requests, predict required resources, and even suggest alternative solutions or products. This would allow the process to proactively allocate resources or route the request to specialized teams before the main validation begins.

The approval gateway could also be made more dynamic. Instead of a simple yes/no, it could include conditional logic based on request value, customer history, or predicted fulfillment complexity. If approval is denied, rather than looping back for re-evaluation, the system could automatically suggest modifications or alternatives, speeding up resolution.

Finally, for both standard and custom paths, the final invoice generation and confirmation could be automated as much as possible, with manual intervention only required for exceptions. This would close the loop quickly and improve customer satisfaction.

Overall, these changes would likely reduce turnaround times by front-loading checks, automating classification, and making approval more flexible. Customer satisfaction would improve due to faster responses and fewer manual delays. However, operational complexity would increase, requiring robust automation, predictive models, and dynamic resource management. The payoff would be a more responsive, adaptable process that can handle both standard and non-standard requests efficiently.
