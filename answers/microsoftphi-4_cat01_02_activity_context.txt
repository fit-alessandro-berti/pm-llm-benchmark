To effectively disambiguate the recurring activities in the support workflow, we need to carefully analyze each instance of the activity and its associated context within the process. Here is the revised version of the event log, with renamed activities to better reflect their contextual differences:

### Revised Event Log

```  
| Case ID | Activity                          | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

### Justification for Naming Choices:

1. **Verify Documents**:
   - **C001**: The first check aimed to validate initial documents but was incomplete, leading to further interaction ("Verify Identity (Initial Check)"). The second occurrence was after the customer provided additional documents, meaning the documents were re-validated ("Verify Identity (Post-Upload)").
   - **C002**: This occurs right after initiating the request and didn't specify further interactions, so it remains as "Verify Identity (Initial Check)".
   - **C003**: This occurred twice with different nearby actions. The initial one was a branch-specific verification ("Verify Identity (Branch Check)"), and the later one was necessary after account correction ("Verify Identity (Post-Adjustment)").

2. **Call Customer**:
   - This was renamed according to the context provided before and after each call: 
     - "Call Customer (ID Request)" for C001's context of requesting documents.
     - "Call Customer (Account Discrepancy)" for C002's context of clarifying account discrepancies.
     - "Call Customer (Return Prompt)" for C003's context of reminding the customer to return to the branch.

3. **Submit Additional**:
   - The name was interpreted as the customer providing additional required documents, hence changed to "Customer Upload Requisite Docs" to more clearly describe the action taken by the customer.

4. **Adjust Account**:
   - For both occurrences in C002 and C003, the adjustment reasons were different: one was internal based on a call clarification, and the other was correction of missing info, so the names were "Adjust Account (Internal)" and "Adjust Account (Correction)" respectively.

These renamings help ensure clarity by distinguishing each activity based on its role and context in the support workflow.
