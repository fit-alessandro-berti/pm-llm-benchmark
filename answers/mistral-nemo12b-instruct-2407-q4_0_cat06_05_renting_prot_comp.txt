Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performances, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second):

1. **Screening Process**:
   - The protected group has more extensive screening processes. They have several variants that include "Extensive Screening" (frequency = 793 for 'Reject Prospective Tenant' and 6 for 'Evict Tenant'), while the unprotected group only has one variant with "Extensive Screening" (frequency = 1022).
   - The protected group also has more variants where tenants are screened after viewing the property but before signing the contract (frequency = 366 + 793 for protected vs. 2490 for unprotected).

2. **Rejection Points**:
   - The protected group tends to reject prospective tenants earlier in the process:
     - They have more variants where tenants are rejected after viewing the property but before signing the contract (frequency = 1036 + 793 vs. 2490 for unprotected).
     - The protected group has a variant where tenants are rejected even before setting an appointment (frequency = 484), while this is not present in the unprotected group.
   - Conversely, the unprotected group tends to reject tenants later in the process:
     - They have more variants where tenants are rejected after signing the contract but before moving in (frequency = 268 + 223 + 156 + ... vs. 366 for protected).
     - The unprotected group has a variant where tenants are rejected even after paying rent once (not present in the protected group).

3. **Eviction Process**:
   - The protected group has one variant that includes an 'Evict Tenant' step (frequency = 6), while this is not present in the unprotected group.

4. **Performance**:
   - On average, the performance (execution time) for the protected group's variants is higher than those of the unprotected group:
     - The highest performance for the protected group is around 1.5 million units (~1259993.929), while it's around 1.2 million units (~1200034.536) for the unprotected group.

These differences suggest that the protected group receives more scrutiny and has a higher threshold for rejection, while the unprotected group is more likely to allow tenants to progress further in the process before rejecting them. The presence of an 'Evict Tenant' step in one group but not the other could indicate different policies or procedures regarding tenant removal. However, these observations are based on frequencies and performances alone; without additional context, it's difficult to determine whether these differences are unfair or simply reflect different needs or preferences between the two groups.
