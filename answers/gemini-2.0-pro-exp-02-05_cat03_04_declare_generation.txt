**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:** A dictionary `declare_model` is created using the structure specified in the prompt, with all possible DECLARE constraint types as keys and empty dictionaries as initial values.
2.  **Unary Constraints:**
    *   `init`: We set `IG` (Idea Generation) as the initial activity.
    *   `exactly_one`: We assume, for a standard successful process, that each key activity (IG, DD, TFC, CE, PC, LT, UT, AG, MP, FL) occurs exactly once. This is a common simplification but might need adjustment (e.g., using `existence` instead) if activities can be skipped or repeated in variations of the process.
3.  **Binary Constraints:**
    *   `succession`: This is used to model the main flow. For instance, `('IG', 'DD')` means Idea Generation must eventually be followed by Design Draft, *and* if Design Draft occurs, Idea Generation must have preceded it. We chain these `succession` constraints to represent the path: IG -> DD -> (TFC, CE) -> PC -> (LT, UT) -> AG -> MP -> FL. Note that multiple activities can follow or precede another (e.g., both TFC and CE follow DD).
    *   `coexistence`: This constraint ensures that if one activity occurs, the other must also occur within the same process instance, regardless of order. We've added it for (TFC, CE) and (LT, UT), suggesting these pairs are typically performed together or are mutually dependent stages following DD and PC, respectively.
4.  **Support and Confidence:** As specified, `(1.0, 1.0)` is used for all defined constraints, indicating maximum support and confidence in these rules for the modeled process.
5.  **Empty Constraints:** Constraint types not used in this specific model (like `absence`, `chainresponse`, etc.) remain as empty dictionaries `{}`.
6.  **Flexibility:** This DECLARE model represents *one possible interpretation* of the scenario, focusing on a relatively strict, linear flow. DECLARE is powerful because you could easily relax constraints (e.g., replace `succession` with `response` or `precedence`) or add alternative paths (`altresponse`, etc.) to model more flexible or varied process executions.
