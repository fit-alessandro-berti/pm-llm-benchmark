1. What is wrong with the current tree  
- After the requisition is approved the following five activities are put in an AND-split:  
  Create_PO, Receive_Goods, Receive_Invoice, Match_Invoice_to_PO and Pay_Invoice.  
- An AND-split means that every execution must contain every child node exactly once, but their order with respect to each other may be arbitrary.  
- In procurement this is impossible (and unwanted):  
  – The PO has to exist before the invoice can be matched to it.  
  – Goods have to be in the system before the invoice can be matched against the receipt.  
  – Matching has to happen before the invoice can be paid.  
  – (Usually) Invoice is received before or after goods, but payment is always the last administrative step and can only be performed after matching has succeeded.  
Consequently the block must not be a parallel operator; a strictly sequential flow – never allowing any of the illegal orderings – is required.

2. A conforming process tree (pm4py style)

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# atomic tasks
create_req      = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req     = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po       = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods   = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice   = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice     = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case      = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# --- fixed, fully sequential structure ----------------------------
root = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.SEQUENCE,
    children=[
        create_req,                    # 1
        approve_req,                   # 2
        create_po,                     # 3  PO has to be there before anything else
        ProcessTree(                   # 4+5  two items may physically arrive in either order
            operator=Operator.PARALLEL,
            children=[receive_goods, receive_invoice]
        ),
        match_invoice,                 # 6  only after receipt of both goods & invoice
        pay_invoice,                   # 7
        close_case                     # 8
    ]
)
```

3. Why this tree is correct  
- Everything is embedded in one overarching sequence, so the stage order 123(4/5)678 is enforced.  
- The only residual parallelism is the little AND-block (receive_goods  receive_invoice). That merely says “both products must arrive before you continue”; every execution still contains both tasks exactly once, but the actual arrival order can be any. All other activities are forced into one single global order – impossible to pay before matching, impossible to match before the PO exists, impossible to close the case before payment, etc.  
- No further operators (choices, loops, skips) are necessary for a basic compliant “Procure-to-Pay” model. The resulting language therefore contains exactly the desired traces and nothing that would violate good-practice business rules.
