# DuckDB SQL Query to Exclude Cases with Specific Sequence and Timing

Here's a query that identifies cases with the specified sequence and timing, then excludes them from the final result:

```sql
WITH
-- First, identify all cases that have the exact sequence we want to exclude
sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT
        e1.case_id
    FROM
        event_log e1
    JOIN
        event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
    JOIN
        event_log e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
    WHERE
        e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        -- Ensure no other events between these three
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM event_log e4
            WHERE e4.case_id = e1.case_id
            AND e4.timestamp > e1.timestamp
            AND e4.timestamp < e2.timestamp
        )
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM event_log e5
            WHERE e5.case_id = e2.case_id
            AND e5.timestamp > e2.timestamp
            AND e5.timestamp < e3.timestamp
        )
),

-- Then identify which of these cases have >5 days between Create Order and Confirm Order
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT
        e1.case_id
    FROM
        sequence_cases e1
    JOIN
        event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
    JOIN
        event_log e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    WHERE
        (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAY
)

-- Final result: all events except those from cases we want to exclude
SELECT
    *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY
    case_id, timestamp;
```

## Explanation:

1. **sequence_cases**: Identifies all cases that contain the exact sequence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' with no other events in between.

2. **cases_to_exclude**: From the sequence cases, further filters to only those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

3. **Final query**: Returns all events except those from cases that meet both criteria (the exact sequence and the timing condition).

The query ensures that:
- The sequence is exact with no intervening events
- The timing condition is properly checked
- The final result excludes all events from matching cases
- Results are ordered by case_id and timestamp for readability
