We need to produce a Python dict with keys: 'equivalence', 'always_before', 'always_after', 'never_together', 'activ_freq', 'directly_follows'.

We need to define constraints based on scenario. We must think about realistic constraints.

Equivalence: maybe activities that must occur same number of times: e.g., Receive Order and Invoice Customer? Actually each order should have one RO and one IC. So equivalence between RO and IC (same occurrences). Also maybe between Generate Shipping Label and Dispatch (one each). Also between Reserve Items and Pick Items? Usually each order reserves items once and picks once. So equivalence between RI and PI. Also between Pack Order and Generate Shipping Label? Might be same count. Could include multiple equivalences.

Always_before: e.g., RO before CA, CA before RI, RI before PI, PI before QC, QC before PO, PO before GSL, GSL before D, D before IC? Actually invoice may be after dispatch or before? Usually invoice after dispatch. So always_before constraints: (RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP) maybe invoice before payment record. Also maybe RO before IC directly.

Always_after: If first occurs, second occurs later. This is similar to always_before but reversed direction. Could include constraints like (CA, RO) always after? Actually always_after means if first occurs, second occurs later. So we can list pairs where second must happen after first. Could be same as always_before but reversed: e.g., (CA, RO) always after? Wait definition: "If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events." Means second occurs after first. So we can list (RO, CA) as always_before, and (CA, RO) as always_after? That would be contradictory. Actually always_before: first must be before second. always_after: first must be after second. So we need constraints where first occurs after second. For example, Payment Record (RP) must occur after Invoice Customer (IC). So (RP, IC) always after. Also QC after PI? Actually QC after PI, so (QC, PI) always after. Similarly D after GSL, etc.

Never_together: activities that cannot co-exist in same case. Maybe none? Could be that Reserve Items and Cancel Order (not present). Could be that Receive Order and Record Payment cannot be together? Actually they can. Maybe never together: maybe "Check Availability" and "Record Payment"? Not realistic. Could leave empty set.

activ_freq: map each activity to allowed occurrence counts. Typically each activity occurs exactly once per order, except maybe QC could be optional? But we can set {1} for most, maybe {0,1} for optional like QC (if no inspection needed). Also maybe Reserve Items optional if items out of stock? But process may skip. We'll set some.

directly_follows: pairs where second must directly follow first. For example, RO directly followed by CA, CA directly followed by RI, RI directly followed by PI, PI directly followed by QC, QC directly followed by PO, PO directly followed by GSL, GSL directly followed by D, D directly followed by IC, IC directly followed by RP. Could also include optional direct follow like QC may be skipped, but we can keep.

We need to present dictionary with sets of tuples. Use Python syntax. Ensure proper formatting.

Let's craft.

Also note formatting rules: Use LaTeX for math, but not needed.

Provide code block with language python.

Let's produce final answer.

Here is a **complete Log‑Skeleton** for the order‑fulfilment scenario.  
All constraints are expressed as sets of activity‑pairs (tuples) and the
activity‑frequency map uses sets of allowed occurrence counts.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # 1. Equivalence – activities that must appear the same number of times
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    "equivalence": {
        ("RO", "IC"),   # one order → one invoice
        ("GSL", "D"),   # one label → one dispatch
        ("RI", "PI"),   # one reservation → one pick
        ("PO", "GSL"),  # one pack → one label
    },

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # 2. Always‑Before – first activity must precede the second one
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    "always_before": {
        ("RO", "CA"),
        ("CA", "RI"),
        ("RI", "PI"),
        ("PI", "QC"),
        ("QC", "PO"),
        ("PO", "GSL"),
        ("GSL", "D"),
        ("D", "IC"),
        ("IC", "RP"),
    },

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # 3. Always‑After – first activity must occur after the second one
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    "always_after": {
        ("QC", "PI"),   # quality check after picking
        ("PO", "QC"),   # packing after quality check
        ("GSL", "PO"),  # label after packing
        ("D", "GSL"),   # dispatch after label
        ("IC", "D"),    # invoice after dispatch
        ("RP", "IC"),   # payment record after invoice
    },

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # 4. Never‑Together – activities that cannot co‑exist in the same case
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # In this process every activity can appear together, so the set is empty.
    "never_together": set(),

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # 5. Activity Frequency – allowed number of occurrences per case
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    "activ_freq": {
        "RO": {1},
        "CA": {1},
        "RI": {1},
        "PI": {1},
        "QC": {0, 1},   # quality check may be skipped for trivial orders
        "PO": {1},
        "GSL": {1},
        "D": {1},
        "IC": {1},
        "RP": {1},
    },

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    # 6. Directly‑Follows – second activity must occur immediately after the first
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    "directly_follows": {
        ("RO", "CA"),
        ("CA", "RI"),
        ("RI", "PI"),
        ("PI", "QC"),
        ("QC", "PO"),
        ("PO", "GSL"),
        ("GSL", "D"),
        ("D", "IC"),
        ("IC", "RP"),
    },
}
```

### How to interpret the dictionary

| Key                | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `equivalence`      | Both activities appear the **same number of times** in every case.     |
| `always_before`    | If the first activity occurs, the second **must have occurred earlier**.|
| `always_after`     | If the first activity occurs, the second **must occur later**.         |
| `never_together`   | Pairs that **cannot appear together** in a single case.                |
| `activ_freq`       | Allowed occurrence counts for each activity (e.g., `{0,1}` means optional).|
| `directly_follows`| The second activity must **immediately follow** the first one.         |

This Log Skeleton captures the typical linear flow of an order‑fulfilment
process while allowing a single optional quality‑check step. Adjust the
sets if additional business rules (e.g., cancellations, re‑work loops) need
to be modelled.
