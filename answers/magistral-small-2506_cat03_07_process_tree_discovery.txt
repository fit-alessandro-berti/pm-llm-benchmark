Based on the event log, the process tree should capture the following key observations:
1. The main sequence is: Receive Application (RA)  Validate Form (VF)  Assess Eligibility (AE)  Approval Decision (AD)  Send Confirmation (SC)  Archive Case (AC).
2. There's an optional loop for "Request Missing Info (RMI)" which may require re-validation (VF) before proceeding to Assess Eligibility (AE).
3. The RMI and re-VF can occur multiple times before continuing to AE.
4. All activities are executed sequentially (no concurrency).

The process tree structure would be:
```
-> (RA,
    -> (VF,
        -> (AE,
            * (RMI,
               -> (VF,
                  AE
              )
            ),
            -> (AD,
                -> (SC,
                    -> (AC)
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

Explanation of the operators:
- `-> (A, B)`: A must happen before B
- `* (A, B)`: Loop - A is executed, then either exit or execute B then A again

This structure:
1. Starts with RA
2. Then VF
3. Then AE
4. Then optionally goes into a loop where RMI is executed, followed by another VF and back to AE (this can repeat)
5. Once out of the loop, proceeds to AD  SC  AC

The silent step (`tau`) is not needed here since all activities are explicitly represented in the log. The tree captures the observed variability (RMI/VF loop) while keeping the main sequence clear.
