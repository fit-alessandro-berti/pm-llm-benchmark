# Bias Analysis in Event Logs

Let's analyze the event logs to identify potential bias. We will look for systematic differences in the processes between Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group).

## Method

1. **Compare Preliminary Scoring**: Check if there are any differences in the preliminary scores between the two groups.
2. **Review Decision Outcomes**: Look at the final decision rates and any patterns in approvals or rejections.
3. **Score Adjustment Analysis**: Examine how score adjustments differ between the groups, particularly with respect to the CommunityGroup attribute.

## Findings

### 1. Preliminary Scoring Comparison

**Group A (Protected Group)**
- Average Preliminary Score: 723.33 (720, 710, 740)
- Range: 710-740
- No community adjustments applied

**Group B (Unprotected Group)**
- Average Preliminary Score: 708.33 (720, 710, 695)
- Range: 695-720
- Community adjustments applied (+10 for 2 cases)

### 2. Decision Outcomes

**Group A**
- Approved: 2 cases (67%)
- Rejected: 1 case (33%)

**Group B**
- Approved: 2 cases (67%)
- Rejected: 1 case (33%)

### 3. Score Adjustment Analysis

**Group A**
- No systematic score adjustments
- Final scores equal to preliminary scores

**Group B**
- Community adjustments applied selectively:
  - Highland Civic Darts Club cases received +10 adjustment (+10 for 2/2 cases)
  - Non-Community cases received no adjustment

## Potential Bias Identification

### Subtle Bias: Lack of Community Adjustments for Protected Group

While both groups have identical success rates (67% approval), the process for deciding who gets score adjustments appears systematically biased.

**Key Issues**:
1. **Selective Application of Community Benefits**: The +10 community boost was only applied to 2/3 cases in Group B, but these cases happened to be those with stronger initial scores (720 in each case). The lowest-scoring Protected Group case (695 in Group B) didn't receive this boost, same as the lowest-scoring case in Group A.
  
2. **Information Potential**: Group B cases had more information available that could be used to make decisions (CommunityGroup names), allowing for nuanced score adjustments. Group A cases had complete neutrality in processing.

### Implications

While fairness metrics (approval rate) look the same between groups, the process demonstrates differential treatment based on group characteristics (CommunityGroup membership):

- Group B benefits from process flexibility - but only when their score is already strong
- Protected Group (Group A) doesn't receive score boosts regardless of potential

This suggests a structural bias where additional information is used to potentially enhance results for some applications while others are systematically disadvantaged despite similar statistical outcomes.
