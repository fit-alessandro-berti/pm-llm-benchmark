1. What strategic assumptions underlie the decision to centralize assembly in Malaysia, and how might shifts in labor costs, geopolitics, or trade policy challenge that choice?  

2. How were the specific component sourcing locations (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, USA) selected, and what trade-offs were made between cost, technological capability, lead time, and supply risk?  

3. In what scenarios would it be beneficial to decouple or resequence certain parallel sourcing or logistics activities to increase resilience without significantly increasing cost?  

4. How does the organization decide when a failed quality check warrants rework versus scrapping, and how are long-term brand reputation and environmental impact factored into that decision?  

5. What mechanisms are in place to detect and mitigate single points of failure in the supply chain (e.g., reliance on a specific region, port, or supplier), and how often are these vulnerabilities reassessed?  

6. How is real-time data from suppliers, logistics providers, and production lines integrated into decision-making, and where are the current blind spots or data lags that could undermine responsiveness?  

7. Under what conditions would the company rebalance the mix between air freight and sea freight, and how are trade-offs between speed, cost, carbon footprint, and service level evaluated?  

8. How does the process ensure effective communication and alignment among globally distributed stakeholders (suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics partners, regulators, retailers) when disruptions occur?  

9. What decision criteria trigger changes to production volume or sourcing strategy when inventory and sales forecasts diverge from plan, and who has authority to make those calls?  

10. How are regulatory and customs-compliance risks monitored proactively across multiple jurisdictions, and what is the escalation path when regulatory environments change unexpectedly?  

11. In what ways could postponement strategies (e.g., late-stage customization, regional configuration) be integrated into this process to improve agility and reduce obsolete stock?  

12. How is quality performance measured across different upstream suppliers, and how do those metrics influence future sourcing decisions or contract negotiations?  

13. What early-warning indicators or scenario models are used to anticipate major disruptions (natural disasters, export controls, cyberattacks, political conflict), and how would the process dynamically adapt?  

14. How does the company balance cost optimization against resilience investments (dual sourcing, excess capacity, strategic safety stocks), and what is the rationale behind its current risk posture?  

15. What feedback loops exist from end-customer experience (e.g., returns, failures, reviews) back into R&D, component selection, and manufacturing process improvements?  

16. How are sustainability and ESG considerations embedded into supplier selection, logistics modes, and rework/scrap handling, and how is performance on these dimensions tracked and reported?  

17. In managing parallel flows (e.g., to different regions and channels), how does the company prevent channel conflict, grey market leakage, or misaligned pricing strategies?  

18. How are performance metrics (such as OTIF, cycle time, yield, forecast accuracy, and total landed cost) prioritized, and what happens when optimizing one metric degrades another?  

19. What governance structures and cross-functional forums exist to regularly review this end-to-end process, challenge existing assumptions, and sponsor structural improvements?  

20. If demand patterns or product architectures change radically (e.g., modular phones, new regulations, onshoring trends), which parts of this process are most easily reconfigurable, and which are rigid bottlenecks that require strategic redesign?
