Below is one way to redesign the process so it is faster, more flexible for nonstandard requests, and better equipped to use automation and analytics. I’ll walk through the current flow stepbystep, propose changes (new gateways/subprocesses), and then summarize the impact.

---

## 1. **Intake & PreScreening (Task A)**
**Current:** “Receive Customer Request”  
**Issues:** Often unstructured, manual triage, late detection of missing info.

### **Redesign**
**New Tasks & Gateways**
1. **Automated Intake & Data Capture**  
   - Use structured web forms / APIs / OCR + NLP (if email or PDF).
   - Autoenrich with CRM data and historical order info.
2. **Gateway: “Is Request Complete?”**  
   - If missing data  automated request to customer (eventbased subprocess).
3. **Predictive Classification (New Task)**  
   - ML model predicts:
     - **Likelihood of customization**
     - **Order complexity**
     - **Approval risk**
4. **Gateway: “Predicted Request Type?”**
   - **High confidence Standard**  fasttrack.
   - **Likely Custom**  custom subprocess.
   - **Unclear / borderline**  **Human triage** (small fast review team).

 **Impact:** Faster routing, fewer manual handoffs, early detection of custom cases.

## 2. **Standard Path (Task B1  C1/C2  D)**  
**Current:** Manual validation then parallel checks.

### **Redesign**
- **Replace Task B1 with Rules Engine / DMN**
  - Automated validation of standard criteria.
- **Parallel Checks remain (C1/C2) but automated**
  - API integrations with credit bureau & inventory system.
  - Add **predictive inventory availability** (forecast possible shortages).
- **New Gateway: “Any Critical Exception?”**
  - If yes  exception handling subprocess (e.g., alternate product, expedited sourcing).
- **Task D: Calculate Delivery Date**
  - Use live capacity & supplier leadtime predictions (not static dates).

 **Impact:** Straightthrough processing for lowrisk standard orders. Fewer delays from manual checks.

---

## 3. **Custom Path (Task B2  E1/E2)**
**Current:** Manual feasibility analysis  quote or rejection.

### **Redesign**
**New SubProcess: “Customization Feasibility & Quotation”**
1. **Automated Configuration Engine**
   - Product configurator or rulesbased feasibility check.
2. **Parallel Checks**
   - Engineering capacity
   - Cost estimation
   - Inventory / supply impact
3. **Gateway: “Customization Complexity Level?”**
   - **Low / Medium**  autogenerate quotation (E1).
   - **High**  route to specialized team.
4. **Gateway: “Feasible?”**
   - If no  automated rejection with alternative suggestions.

 **Impact:** Most custom requests no longer wait for full manual feasibility; specialists only handle complex ones.

---

## 4. **Approval Stage (Gateway “Is Approval Needed?”)**
**Current:** Binary approval, often manual bottleneck.

### **Redesign**
- **Decision Table / Risk Scoring**
  - Autoapproval for lowrisk or lowvalue orders.
  - Approval required only above threshold or predicted risk.
- **Parallel Approval Trigger**
  - If approval needed, start manager review **in parallel** with quote generation.
- **Escalation Timer**
  - If no response in SLA  reassign or autoescalate.

 **Impact:** Significant reduction in approval delays.

---

## 5. **Invoice & Confirmation (Task G  I)**
**Current:** Generate invoice after approval.

### **Redesign**
- **Automated Invoice Generation**
  - Integrate CPQ/ERP; trigger einvoice.
- **SelfService Customer Portal**
  - Status tracking, digital approval/signature, updates.
- **Predictive ETA Updates**
  - Proactive communication if delivery risk is forecasted.

 **Impact:** Faster close, better transparency, improved satisfaction.

---

## 6. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
**New Capability Across Process**
- Skillbased routing and queue balancing (e.g., low complexity  junior team, complex  senior engineering).
- Workload forecasting (predict spikes in custom requests).
- Automated reassignment if bottlenecks appear.

 **Impact:** Greater throughput and flexibility without adding headcount.

---

## 7. **New BPMN Elements to Add**
**Suggested New Gateways / Subprocesses:**
- **“Request Complete?” Gateway**
- **“Predicted Customization?” Gateway**
- **Custom Feasibility SubProcess**
- **“Complexity Level?” Gateway**
- **Exception Handling SubProcess**
- **SLA Escalation Events (timer boundary events)**

# Overall Impact Summary

| Aspect | Expected Effect |
|---|---|
| **Turnaround Time** | Reduced via automation, parallel approvals, straightthrough processing |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | Faster responses, more accurate quotes, proactive updates |
| **Flexibility for NonStandard Requests** | High—predictive routing + custom subprocess |
| **Operational Complexity** | Increases due to analytics + automation systems, but controlled through modular subprocesses |
| **Risk Management** | Improved via predictive scoring and exception workflows |

## Final Thought
The redesigned process makes **“standard” requests nearly touchless** while ensuring **custom requests are routed early to the right capabilities**. The tradeoff is higher technical complexity and governance needs (models, integrations, data quality), but the payoff is substantial in speed, accuracy, and customer experience.

If you want, I can sketch a revised BPMN diagram or provide a more formal BPMNstyle pseudomodel based on these changes.
