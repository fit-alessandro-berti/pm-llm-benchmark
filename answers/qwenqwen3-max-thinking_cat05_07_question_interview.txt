Here is a list of targeted, open-ended questions designed to clarify and deepen understanding of the property onboarding process:

1. **Initial Intake & Documentation**  
   - What specific documents are considered “mandatory” for onboarding, and how do these requirements vary by city or property type (e.g., single-family vs. multi-unit)?  
   - How do you determine whether a document is “outdated,” and what is the typical timeframe for acceptable inspection or compliance certificates?

2. **Property Coordinator Role**  
   - Beyond document review, what other responsibilities does the property coordinator have during the initial phase?  
   - If a landlord repeatedly fails to provide updated documentation, what escalation path or alternative actions are available?

3. **Property Manager Assignment**  
   - Can you walk me through how the system (or team) weighs the different factors—workload, geography, experience, and landlord requirements—when assigning a property manager? Is there a formal scoring or matching logic?  
   - Are there situations where a landlord can request a specific property manager, and how is that handled?

4. **Introductory Meeting**  
   - What are the most common “special conditions” or policy disagreements that arise during the introductory call, and how are they typically resolved?  
   - Is there a standard checklist or agenda used during this meeting to ensure consistency?

5. **Inspection & Repairs**  
   - What types of issues discovered during inspection typically require landlord involvement versus being handled directly by your company?  
   - How is the timeline for repairs managed, and who bears the cost if urgent fixes are needed before marketing can begin?

6. **Marketing Activation**  
   - How does the digital marketing team decide which channels or listing platforms to use for a given property?  
   - What triggers the “activation” of a property in the rental portal—completion of inspection, marketing materials ready, or something else?

7. **Tenant Screening & Selection**  
   - What are the minimum criteria a tenant must meet to be considered eligible (e.g., credit score thresholds, income-to-rent ratios)?  
   - In competitive scenarios with multiple qualified applicants, what specific factors tip the decision—lease length, move-in timing, rental history, or others?

8. **Lease Finalization**  
   - How are custom lease clauses (requested by landlords) reviewed for legal and regulatory compliance before being included in the final agreement?  
   - Who is responsible for collecting the security deposit and first month’s rent—the property manager, a centralized finance team, or another party?

9. **Quality Assurance & Audits**  
   - At what stage(s) do the compliance officer, financial analyst, and IT department typically conduct their reviews—before activation, after tenant placement, or both?  
   - What happens if one of these audits identifies a significant discrepancy (e.g., rental price misaligned with strategy or a fair housing violation)?

10. **Exception Handling**  
    - Can you describe a recent example of a complex exception (e.g., a property needing special insurance or a landlord insisting on non-standard terms) and how your team navigated it?  
    - Are there certain types of properties or landlord requests that your company routinely declines to onboard, and what are those red flags?

11. **Process Timing & Handoffs**  
    - What is the typical end-to-end duration for onboarding a standard property, and which steps most commonly cause delays?  
    - How are handoffs between roles (e.g., from coordinator to property manager, or property manager to marketing team) formally communicated and tracked?

12. **System & Communication Tools**  
    - How do you ensure that updates or decisions made via email or calls are consistently captured in your CRM or project management system?  
    - Are there any known gaps or pain points in how information flows between regional offices, landlords, and internal teams?

These questions aim to uncover implicit rules, clarify accountability, understand variability, and reveal how the process adapts to real-world complexity—all without requesting technical implementation details.
