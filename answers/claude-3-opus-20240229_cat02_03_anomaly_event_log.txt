After analyzing the event log, I have identified the following anomalies and potential issues:

Case 1002:
1. The Purchase Order was issued before the Purchase Requisition was approved. This violates standard procurement controls, as requisitions should be approved before POs are issued to ensure proper authorization of spending.

2. The Payment was released and the Vendor Invoice was received before the Goods were received. This is problematic because it's best practice to only pay invoices after confirming the goods have been received in acceptable condition. Paying before receiving goods increases risk of financial loss if the wrong items are delivered, items are missing, or items are defective.

3. The Invoice was matched to the PO after the payment was already released. Invoice matching should always occur before payment to ensure the invoice details align with the PO and goods receipt. Paying before matching increases risk of overbilling or paying incorrect/fraudulent invoices.

Case 1003: 
1. Payment was released before the Vendor Invoice was received, Goods were received, and Invoice was matched to the PO. As mentioned above, this violates best practices around the 3-way match (PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice) that should occur before payment.  Paying without an invoice and before receiving the goods is highly unusual and increases financial risks.

Case 1004:
1. Goods were received before the Purchase Order was issued. This implies goods were ordered and delivered without a valid PO as a control document. POs should always be issued to the vendor to initiate the order. Receiving goods without a PO can lead to unapproved spending.

In summary, the main issues are payments occurring before key control steps (receiving goods, receiving invoices, and performing 3-way match), as well as POs being issued at the wrong time relative to requisition approval and goods receipt. These deviations increase risks of financial losses, fraudulent transactions, unapproved spending and noncompliance with procurement policies. The process sequences in cases 1002-1004 should be corrected.
