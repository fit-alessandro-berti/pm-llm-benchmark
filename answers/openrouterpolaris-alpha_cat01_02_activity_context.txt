Great scenario. I’ll keep this compact and precise.

Step 1: Identify recurring, context-dependent activities

Activities reused with different meanings/roles:
- Verify Documents
- Call Customer

We’ll disambiguate them based on:
- Their position in the case (initial vs follow-up)
- Triggering reason (missing documents, clarification, return to branch, etc.)
- Outcome/intent (collect info, clarify, confirm, re-check)

Step 2 & 3: Revised event log with renamed activities

C001
- Initiate Request  (kept) Initiate Request (Online Submission)
- Verify Documents (first)  Initial Identity Document Verification
- Call Customer  Outbound Call for Missing Documentation
- Submit Additional  (kept) Submit Additional Documentation
- Verify Documents (second)  Follow-up Document Reverification (After Submission)
- Approve Request  (kept) Final Request Approval

C002
- Initiate Request  Initiate Request (Online Submission)
- Verify Documents  Initial Identity Verification
- Call Customer (first)  Outbound Call for Account Discrepancy Clarification
- Adjust Account  (kept) Internal Account Adjustment (Post-Clarification)
- Call Customer (second)  Outbound Call to Confirm Account Adjustments
- Approve Request  Final Request Approval

C003
- Initiate Request  Initiate Request (In-Branch)
- Verify Documents (first)  Initial In-Branch Document Verification
- Call Customer  Outbound Call to Request Customer Return to Branch
- Adjust Account  Internal Account Adjustment (Missing/Corrected Information)
- Verify Documents (second)  Post-Adjustment Document Reverification (In-Branch)
- Approve Request  Final Request Approval

Step 4: Brief justification of naming choices

- “Initial … Verification” vs “Follow-up/Post-Adjustment Reverification”:
  - Distinguishes first-time checks from targeted re-checks after new info/documents or adjustments.
  - Reflects their different control-flow roles: gate to progress vs validation of corrections.

- “Outbound Call for Missing Documentation” (C001):
  - Context: triggered specifically by incomplete verification and a need for more documents.

- “Outbound Call for Account Discrepancy Clarification” (C002, first call):
  - Context: purpose is investigative/clarificatory before internal changes.

- “Outbound Call to Confirm Account Adjustments” (C002, second call):
  - Context: purpose is confirmation of actions already taken, different from the first call.

- “Outbound Call to Request Customer Return to Branch” (C003):
  - Context: logistical request, not clarification or documentation collection.

- Channel/Location qualifiers (“Online Submission”, “In-Branch”, “In-Branch Document Verification”):
  - Highlight that the same logical activity differs operationally by entry channel, which often matters in process analysis.

If you’d like, I can now put this into a single cleaned-up table for direct use in a process mining tool.
