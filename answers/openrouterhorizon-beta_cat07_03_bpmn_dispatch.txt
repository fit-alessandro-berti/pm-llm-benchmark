This is a BPMN swimlane process diagram that models how a computer hardware shop prepares and dispatches goods.

- Lanes: Logistics (top), Dispatch of goods/Secretary (middle), and Warehouse (bottom).
- Start event: “Ship goods.”
- Early step: “Clarify shipment method.” A gateway asks “Special handling?” If yes, the process gets three offers from logistics companies, then “Select logistic company and place order.” If no, it proceeds to check insurance.
- Insurance branch: “Check if insurance is required” (uses customer information). If insurance is necessary, “Insure parcel.” Regardless, “Write package label,” then merge.
- Parallel/merge gateway routes work to the Warehouse: “Package goods.” There’s an intermediate timer of 48 hours leading to “Notify customer about delay” if packaging takes too long; that message then rejoins the main flow.
- After logistics selection/labeling, flows converge and go to “Fill out shipment paperwork,” then “Move package to pickup area.”
- End event: “Shipment prepared.”

Artifacts: “Order details” data object; “Customer information” data store; multiple gateways (exclusive and parallel) control decisions and synchronization.
