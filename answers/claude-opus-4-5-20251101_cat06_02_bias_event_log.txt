# Bias Analysis of the Loan Application Process

## Executive Summary

This event log reveals **systematic bias** favoring applicants who are local residents and members of specific community groups, creating disparate outcomes for equally or more creditworthy applicants who lack these affiliations.

---

## Identified Sources of Bias

### 1. **Community Group Score Adjustment (+10 Points)**

The most explicit bias mechanism is the automatic +10 point bonus for membership in the "Highland Civic Darts Club."

| Case | Initial Score | Community Adjustment | Final Score | Decision |
|------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|----------|
| C001 | 710 | +10 | 720 | **Approved** |
| C004 | 690 | +10 | 700 | **Approved** |
| C003 | 715 | 0 | 715 | **Rejected** |

**Critical Finding:** C003 (score 715) was **rejected** despite having a higher preliminary score than C004 (690), who was approved solely due to the community affiliation bonus.

### 2. **Comparative Case Analysis**

 Case     Score  Local Res.   Group  Final    Decision     

 C001     710    TRUE         YES    720       Approved   
 C002     720    TRUE         NO     720       Approved   
 C003     715    FALSE        NO     715       REJECTED   
 C004     690    TRUE         YES    700       Approved   
 C005     740    FALSE        NO     740       Approved   

```

### 3. **The "Hidden Threshold" Problem**

The data suggests an **implicit approval threshold** around 720 points:

- **C003** at 715 (non-local, no group): Rejected
- **C001** at 710  720 (local + group): Approved
- **C004** at 690  700 (local + group): Approved  *Below threshold but approved*

This reveals **inconsistent threshold application** based on protected/proxy characteristics.

## Mechanisms of Bias

### A. **Direct Bias: Score Adjustments**
```
Community Membership  +10 Points  Higher Approval Rate
```
- Only available to members of specific organizations
- Creates **proxy discrimination** based on social networks

### B. **Indirect/Structural Bias: Geographic Residency**

| Residency Status | Cases | Rejection Rate |
|-----------------|-------|----------------|
| Local Resident (TRUE) | 3 | 0% (0/3) |
| Non-Local (FALSE) | 2 | 50% (1/2) |

While no explicit adjustment exists for residency, **C003's rejection** (non-local, 715 score) compared to **C004's approval** (local, 690700 adjusted) suggests residency influences outcomes.

---

## Fairness Implications

### 1. **Disparate Impact**
Applicants without community affiliations must achieve **higher raw creditworthiness** to obtain the same outcomes:

```
To match C004's approval (700 adjusted):
 With community bonus:  690 base score needed
 Without community bonus: 700+ base score needed (minimum)

To guarantee approval (based on C003's rejection at 715):
 With community bonus:  ~710 base score (see C001)
 Without community bonus: ~720+ base score (see C002)
```

### 2. **Who Is Disadvantaged?**

| Group | Disadvantage |
|-------|--------------|
| **Newcomers/Migrants** | Cannot claim local residency; excluded from established community groups |
| **Socially Isolated Individuals** | Less likely to belong to civic organizations |
| **Lower Socioeconomic Status** | Less time/resources for club memberships |
| **Younger Applicants** | Less established community ties |
| **Minority Communities** | May not be represented in "recognized" civic groups |

### 3. **The "Highland Civic Darts Club" Problem**

The specific recognition of this club raises questions:
- Who decides which groups qualify for bonuses?
- Are diverse community organizations equally recognized?
- Does this create **in-group favoritism**?

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Remove or justify** community group score adjustments with empirical evidence of creditworthiness correlation
2. **Blind reviewers** to residency and community affiliation during manual review
3. **Audit threshold application** for consistency across demographic groups

### Structural Changes
1. **Expand recognized communities** if bonus is retained—ensure diverse representation
2. **Implement fairness metrics** (demographic parity, equalized odds)
3. **Create appeals process** for rejected applicants near threshold

### Monitoring
1. Track approval rates by residency status and community affiliation
2. Conduct regular disparate impact analysis
3. Review cases where adjusted scores changed outcomes

---

## Conclusion

The process embeds **structural advantages** for locally-connected applicants that cannot be justified by creditworthiness alone. The most egregious example is **C003's rejection at 715** while **C004 was approved at an adjusted 700**—a 15-point raw score difference overcome entirely through social affiliation. This creates a system where *who you know* matters more than *whether you can repay*.
