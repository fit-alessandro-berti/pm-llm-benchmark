**Explanation:**

**Model 1 (WITH POTENTIAL UNFAIRNESS):**
- Contains a **loop** (`*`) between `DataCompletenessCheck` and `RequestMoreInfo` to handle incomplete applications
- After `SkillAssessment`, includes an **XOR choice** (`X`) between:
  - `CulturalFitCheck` (standard evaluation path)
  - `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (alternative path that may provide advantages based on local affiliations)
- This XOR branch is the **source of potential bias**, as applicants affiliated with certain groups may receive preferential treatment through a different evaluation pathway

**Model 2 (WITHOUT UNFAIRNESS):**
- Maintains the same **loop** for data completeness checking
- **Removes the XOR branch** entirely after `SkillAssessment`
- All applicants flow through a single `CulturalFitCheck` activity
- Ensures **equal treatment** by eliminating the alternative pathway that could introduce bias

Both models maintain the sequential nature of the hiring process while clearly demonstrating how the presence or absence of an XOR branch can create or eliminate structural unfairness in the workflow.
