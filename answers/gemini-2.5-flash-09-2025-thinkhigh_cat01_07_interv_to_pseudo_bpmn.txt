### 1. Roles / Lanes (Participants)

| Lane Name | Role/Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **L1: Supplier** | External entity providing the invoice. |
| **L2: Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** | Initiates the process, handles logging, initial checks, matching, and payment scheduling. (Mary) |

| **L6: Department Manager** | Provides final business approval for the invoice. (Carlos) |

### 2. Activities and Sequence Flow

**Start Event:** Invoice Received

#### Phase 1: Initial Validation and Logging (L2: AP Clerk)

| Step ID | Activity Description | Handoff/Transition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A1** | Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number | **G1: PO Check** | Initial validation upon receipt (Mary). |

**G1: PO Check (Exclusive Gateway)**
*   **Path 1: PO Missing/Invalid:** Flow to A2 (Rework Loop 1).
*   **Path 2: PO Present/Valid:** Flow to A3.

| Step ID | Activity Description | Handoff/Transition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A2** | Request PO Details/Corrected Invoice | L1: Supplier | Invoice sent back to supplier (Mary). Rework Loop 1 complete when Supplier sends corrected invoice (return to Start Event). |
| **A3** | Log Invoice into Accounting System | A4 | System captures initial data (Mary). |
| **A4** | Forward Invoice for Goods Receipt Confirmation | L3: Purchasing Team | Request sent for confirmation (Mary). |

#### Phase 2: Purchasing Confirmation and Verification (L3: Purchasing Team)

| Step ID | Activity Description | Handoff/Transition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A5** | Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services & Verify Details against PO | **G2: Purchasing Verification** | Checking quantities, prices, etc. (Dan). |

**G2: Purchasing Verification (Exclusive Gateway)**
*   **Path 1: Details Verified & Correct:** Flow to A6.
*   **Path 2: Discrepancy Found:** Flow to A7 (Rework Loop 2 Initiation).

| Step ID | Activity Description | Handoff/Transition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A6** | Send Confirmation of Receipt to Accounts Payable | A8 (Back to L2) | Confirms goods received and invoice matches PO details (Dan). |
| **A7** | Notify AP Clerk of Discrepancy / Hold Invoice | A7.1 or A7.2 (L5/L2) | Discrepancy noted (e.g., extra units billed) (Dan). |
| **A7.1 (Sub-Task)** | Supplier Discrepancy Resolution | L5: SRM | Pricing/contract issues handled by SRM (Karen). If resolved, flows back to L2. |
| **A7.2 (Sub-Task)** | Request Corrected Invoice from Supplier | L1: Supplier | May result in a restart of the process, or return to A5. |

#### Phase 3: Invoice Matching and Exception Handling (L2, L4)

| Step ID | Activity Description | Handoff/Transition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A8** | Match Invoice Line Items against PO in System | **G3: Matching Success Check** | Done after receipt confirmation (Mary). |

**G3: Matching Success Check (Exclusive Gateway)**
*   **Path 1: Perfect Match:** Flow to A11 (Manager Approval Request).
*   **Path 2: Discrepancy Found (Price, Items, etc.):** Flow to A9.

| Step ID | Activity Description | Handoff/Transition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A9** | Attempt to Resolve Discrepancy with Purchasing Team | **G4: Resolution Escalation Check** | Email clarification (Mary). |

**G4: Resolution Escalation Check (Exclusive Gateway)**
*   **Path 1: Resolved Locally:** Flow returns to A8 (Re-Attempt Matching).
*   **Path 2: Cannot Resolve Easily/Requires Exception Handling:** Flow to A10.

| Step ID | Activity Description | Handoff/Transition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A10** | Escalate Invoice to AP Supervisor | L4: AP Supervisor | Used for difficult or non-PO exceptions (Mary). |
| **A10.1 (Sub-Task)** | Resolve Exception (e.g., Create Retrospective PO, Coordinate Departments) | A10.2 / A5 / A8 | Supervisor (Rita) intervenes. If successful, invoice is routed back to the normal flow. |
| **A10.2 (Sub-Task)** | Route Resolved Invoice Back to Normal Flow | A8 (Re-match) or A11 (Direct to Approval) | Based on Rita's description, the invoice should proceed to Purchasing confirmation (A5) or Matching (A8) if necessary, or directly to Manager Approval (A11) if all requirements are met. |

#### Phase 4: Final Approval and Payment (L2, L6)

| Step ID | Activity Description | Handoff/Transition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **A14** | Reject Invoice / Request Further Investigation | A10 (L4) / A9 (L2) | Manager rejects due to budget/suspicion (Carlos). Flows back into the investigation/escalation phase. |

**End Event:** Payment Scheduled

### 3. Summary of Gateways

| Gateway ID | Type | Condition | Diverging Paths |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **G2** | Exclusive (XOR) | Is Receipt Confirmed and Details Correct? | Yes (A6); No (A7 - Rework/Hold) |
| **G3** | Exclusive (XOR) | Does the Invoice Match the PO? | Yes (A11); No (A9 - Discrepancy Handling) |
