Event abstraction is a powerful technique that can significantly enhance the readability and maintainability of complex process models derived from event logs. Here are some key ways this can be achieved:

1. **Identifying Key Events**: Begin by identifying the most crucial events in your process model. These are typically those that have the highest frequency, impact, or importance.

2. **Domain-Specific Abstraction**: Focus on domain-specific abstractions, such as event types or event categories, rather than raw data. For example, if you're dealing with financial transactions, instead of capturing every single detail about each transaction (such as customer ID, product name, amount, etc.), focus on identifying and managing the most common events that drive business decisions.

3. **Event Sequencing**: Organize your events in a way that makes logical sense. This often involves analyzing how different events occur over time and grouping them into meaningful sequences or flows within the process model.

4. **Modeling with Simplified Events**: Use simpler, more generic representations of events where possible to reduce complexity without losing essential information about business activities. For instance, instead of capturing detailed interactions between customers and products, you might represent "customer making a purchase" as an event that doesn't specify the product or customer details.

5. **Event Aggregation and Combinatorial Abstraction**: Aggregate related events together into more general types to reduce redundancy and improve understanding. This can help in creating a simplified process model while still capturing the essence of the interactions between actors and the overall flow of operations.

6. **Event Filtering and Redundancy Reduction**: Apply filtering techniques to eliminate redundant or less significant event data that does not contribute meaningfully to the core process logic. This step helps in focusing on what is critical for analysis and decision-making.

7. **Visualization Techniques**: Employ visualization tools and formats such as UML (Unified Modeling Language), BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams, or other graphical representations that can effectively communicate the essence of complex events without cluttering them with excessive details.

8. **Process Decomposition**: Break down large process models into smaller, manageable components if they are too complex to comprehend at a high level. Each component could then be modeled using event abstraction techniques tailored to its specific context within the larger system.

9. **Contextual Clarity**: Ensure that your event abstractions are applied in the context of business operations and decision-making processes rather than just technical details. This helps in making sure that even non-technical stakeholders can understand the significance of each event.

10. **User Feedback Loops**: Incorporate feedback loops to refine the abstraction process iteratively based on user understanding, usability testing, or operational metrics. Continuous improvement ensures that the simplified models remain relevant and effective as processes evolve.

By systematically applying these strategies, organizations can develop more accessible, manageable, and actionable process models derived from event logs, ultimately improving their ability to respond effectively to changes in business environments.
