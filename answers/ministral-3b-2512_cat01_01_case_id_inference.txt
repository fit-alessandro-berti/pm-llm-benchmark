To infer the case groupings from this interleaved sequence of hospital process events, we can analyze the following key attributes for each event:

1. **Patient Age & Gender** – These are unique identifiers for each patient in this dataset.
2. **Department & Activity Sequence** – Events must logically follow in a patient's journey (e.g., ER registration  triage  possible surgery  discharge).
3. **Timing Constraints** – Events must be temporally consistent for the same patient (e.g., no event from one patient appearing before another's registration).

### **Case Groupings (Inferred Case IDs)**
From the given data, we can identify **three distinct cases** based on patient age/gender and their logical event sequences:

#### **Case 1 (Patient Age: 45, Gender: M)**
- **Events:**
  1. `Register patient` (ER, private insurance)
  4. `Initial triage` (ER, triage_code=3)
  7. `X-ray imaging` (Radiology, left_leg)
  12. `Doctor consultation` (ER, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
  15. `Patient discharged` (ER, outpatient clinic)

#### **Case 2 (Patient Age: 62, Gender: F)**
- **Events:**
  2. `Register patient` (ER, public insurance)
  5. `Initial triage` (ER, triage_code=2)
  8. `Lab test requested` (ER, blood_panel)
  10. `Lab test completed` (Lab, normal_levels)
  11. `Doctor consultation` (ER, diagnosis=minor_infection)
  14. `Prescription created` (ER, antibiotics)
  17. `Patient discharged` (ER, pharmacy pickup)

#### **Case 3 (Patient Age: 28, Gender: M)**
- **Events:**
  3. `Register patient` (Surgery, private insurance)
  6. `Doctor consultation` (Surgery, scheduled_knee_surgery)
  9. `Surgery preparation` (Surgery, general_anesthesia)
  13. `Surgery performed` (Surgery, arthroscopy)
  16. `Recovery room` (Surgery, stable)
  18. `Patient discharged` (Surgery, physiotherapy sessions)

### **Summary of Case Groupings**
| **Case ID** | **Patient Age/Gender** | **Departments Involved** | **Key Activities** |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| **Case A**  | 45, M                   | ER, Radiology            | Registration  Triage  X-ray  Consultation  Discharge |
| **Case B**  | 62, F                   | ER, Laboratory           | Registration  Triage  Lab Test  Consultation  Prescription  Discharge |
| **Case C**  | 28, M                   | Surgery                  | Registration  Surgery Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge |

### **Verification of Logical Consistency**
- Each case has a **unique patient** (age/gender).
- Events are **chronologically ordered** within each case.
- Departments and activities follow **realistic hospital workflows** (e.g., ER  Radiology for Case A, Surgery for Case C).
- No **cross-case overlaps** in patient attributes or timing.

This grouping ensures that all events are correctly assigned to their respective patient journeys.
