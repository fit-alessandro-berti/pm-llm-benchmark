Based on the description of the complex order fulfillment process, we will define the declarative constraints that govern the sequence and co-existence of the activities.

## Log Skeleton Construction

The Log Skeleton is structured as a Python dictionary:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': set(),
    'always_after': set(),
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': dict(),
    'directly_follows': set()
}
```

### 1. Activity Occurrences (`activ_freq`)

In a standard order process, activities like receiving, picking, packing, and dispatching usually occur exactly once. Activities like payment might not occur yet (if it's post-paid or cancelled).

| Activity | Constraint | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **RO** | $\{1\}$ | The order must be received exactly once. |
| **CA** | $\{1\}$ | Availability must be checked exactly once. |
| **RI** | $\{1\}$ | Items must be reserved exactly once. |
| **PI** | $\{1\}$ | Items must be picked exactly once. |
| **QC** | $\{1\}$ | Quality check must be performed exactly once. |
| **PO** | $\{1\}$ | Packing must happen exactly once. |
| **GSL**| $\{1\}$ | The shipping label is generated exactly once per package. |
| **D** | $\{1\}$ | The order is dispatched exactly once. |
| **IC** | $\{1\}$ | The invoice is generated exactly once. |
| **RP** | $\{0, 1\}$ | Payment recording might occur later or not be present in the observed process segment (or if the order is canceled). |

```python
log_skeleton['activ_freq'] = {
    'RO': {1}, 'CA': {1}, 'RI': {1}, 'PI': {1}, 'QC': {1},
    'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1}, 'D': {1}, 'IC': {1}, 'RP': {0, 1}
}
```

### 2. Directly-Follows Constraints (`directly_follows`)

These define immediate, rigid steps in the process flow.

*   After checking availability, items are immediately reserved.
*   After the Quality Check, the order is immediately packed.
*   After the order is packed, the shipping label is generated immediately.
*   After the label is generated, the order is dispatched immediately.

```python
log_skeleton['directly_follows'] = {
    ('CA', 'RI'),
    ('QC', 'PO'),
    ('PO', 'GSL'),
    ('GSL', 'D')
}
```

### 3. Always Before Constraints (`always_before`)

These define critical prerequisite relationships (A $\rightarrow$ B means A must occur before B).

*   **RO** must happen before everything else (except perhaps post-shipment activities like IC/RP).
    *   RO $\rightarrow$ PI, RO $\rightarrow$ QC, RO $\rightarrow$ D
*   Picking must happen before Quality Check, Packing, and Dispatch.
    *   PI $\rightarrow$ QC, PI $\rightarrow$ PO, PI $\rightarrow$ D
*   Dispatch must happen before Invoice or Payment Record.
    *   D $\rightarrow$ IC, D $\rightarrow$ RP

```python
log_skeleton['always_before'] = {
    ('RO', 'CA'),  # Check must follow the order receipt
    ('CA', 'PI'),  # Availability check must precede picking
    ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserving must precede picking
    ('PI', 'QC'),  # Picking must precede quality check
    ('QC', 'D'),   # QC must precede dispatch
    ('D', 'IC'),   # Dispatch must precede invoicing
    ('D', 'RP')    # Dispatch must precede payment record
}
```

### 4. Always After Constraints (`always_after`)

These define rigid post-requisite relationships (A $\rightarrow$ B means B must occur after A). This is often the inverse of `always_before`, but we define the most crucial ones directly based on the flow structure.

*   Invoicing and Payment must always occur after Dispatch.
    *   IC $\leftarrow$ D, RP $\leftarrow$ D

```python
log_skeleton['always_after'] = {
    ('IC', 'D'),
    ('RP', 'D')
}
```

### 5. Equivalence Constraints (`equivalence`)

Equivalence implies that two activities must occur exactly the same number of times (usually 0 or 1). In this process, the core physical steps are highly coupled.

*   If items are reserved, they must be picked (and vice versa).

```python
log_skeleton['equivalence'] = {
    ('RI', 'PI')
}
```

### 6. Never Together Constraints (`never_together`)

These activities cannot co-exist in the same case. Since this is a standard linear fulfillment process where all steps are typically required, there are no immediate clear examples of mutually exclusive activities *within a single successful case*.

(If the process allowed an early "Cancel Order" activity, that activity would be Never Together with 'Dispatch', but based on the provided activities, we assume a single coherent flow.)

```python
log_skeleton['never_together'] = set()
```

## Final Log Skeleton Dictionary

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RI', 'PI')
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'PI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('D', 'RP')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('IC', 'D'),
        ('RP', 'D')
    },
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1}, 'CA': {1}, 'RI': {1}, 'PI': {1}, 'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1}, 'D': {1}, 'IC': {1}, 'RP': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D')
    }
}
```
