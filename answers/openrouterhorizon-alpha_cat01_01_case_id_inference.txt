Here are the inferred case groupings, treating each unique patient (by age/gender/department context) as a distinct case and ordering events logically by time and clinical flow.

Case A: ER patient, 45-year-old male
- 1. 08:05:13 Register patient (ER)
- 4. 08:10:50 Initial triage (ER, triage_code=3)
- 7. 08:15:42 X-ray imaging (Radiology, left_leg)
- 12. 08:23:10 Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- 15. 08:30:05 Patient discharged (ER, followup=outpatient_clinic)

Case B: ER patient, 62-year-old female
- 2. 08:07:02 Register patient (ER)
- 5. 08:12:29 Initial triage (ER, triage_code=2)
- 8. 08:16:10 Lab test requested (ER, blood_panel)
- 10. 08:20:27 Lab test completed (Laboratory, results=normal_levels)
- 11. 08:22:54 Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- 14. 08:27:00 Prescription created (ER, antibiotics)
- 17. 08:35:29 Patient discharged (ER, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

Case C: Surgery patient, 28-year-old male
- 3. 08:07:15 Register patient (Surgery)
- 6. 08:13:00 Doctor consultation (Surgery, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
- 9. 08:16:45 Surgery preparation (Surgery, general_anesthesia)
- 13. 08:25:19 Surgery performed (Surgery, arthroscopy)
- 16. 08:31:37 Recovery room (Surgery, condition=stable)
- 18. 08:40:13 Patient discharged (Surgery, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

Rationale: Events align by consistent patient attributes and plausible clinical sequence within departments; timestamps progress logically for each patient’s journey. No cross-over of attributes suggests only these three distinct cases.
