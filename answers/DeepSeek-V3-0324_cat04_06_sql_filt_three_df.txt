# DuckDB SQL Query Solution

Here's a SQL query that identifies cases with the specified activity sequence and timing condition, then excludes those cases from the final result:

```sql
WITH 
-- First, identify cases that have the problematic sequence
problematic_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
    FROM event_log e1
    JOIN event_log e2 ON 
        e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND
        e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp AND
        e2.activity = 'Create Order' AND
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM event_log e 
            WHERE e.case_id = e1.case_id 
            AND e.timestamp > e1.timestamp 
            AND e.timestamp < e2.timestamp
        )
    JOIN event_log e3 ON 
        e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND
        e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp AND
        e3.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM event_log e 
            WHERE e.case_id = e2.case_id 
            AND e.timestamp > e2.timestamp 
            AND e.timestamp < e3.timestamp
        )
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND date_diff('day', e2.timestamp, e3.timestamp) > 5
)

-- Return all events except those from problematic cases
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problematic_cases)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

## Explanation:

1. The `problematic_cases` CTE identifies cases that:
   - Have the exact sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' → 'Create Order' → 'Confirm Order'
   - With no other events between each consecutive pair in the sequence
   - Where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days

2. The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries ensure there are no intervening events between the sequence elements.

3. The main query then returns all events from the log except those belonging to the identified problematic cases.

4. Results are ordered by case_id and timestamp for readability.

The query handles the requirements by:
- Detecting the exact sequence with no intervening events
- Applying the 5-day timing condition
- Excluding all events from matching cases
- Preserving the original event log structure for non-matching cases
