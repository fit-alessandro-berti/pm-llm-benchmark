Process cubes are a key concept in multi-dimensional process mining, which is the analysis of processes across multiple dimensions such as time, data sources, and business activities. In traditional process mining approaches, the focus is on analyzing a single process model or workflow and identifying patterns and anomalies. However, in multi-dimensional process mining, process cubes play an important role in visualizing and analyzing complex processes across multiple dimensions.

Process cubes are essentially a combination of traditional process models and data cubes used in data warehousing. A process cube is a multi-dimensional array where each dimension represents a different aspect of the process, such as time, data source, or business activity. The process cube stores information about each process instance, including its start time, end time, data inputs and outputs, and any other relevant information.

The key difference between process cubes and traditional process mining approaches is that process cubes can capture and analyze complex processes across multiple dimensions. For example, a process cube could be used to analyze how a company's supply chain operates over time, across different data sources, and in relation to different business activities. This information can then be used to identify bottlenecks, optimize workflows, and improve overall efficiency.

Process cubes also provide the ability to drill down into specific dimensions of a process to gain deeper insights. For example, a user could use a process cube to explore how a particular data source is being used in the company's supply chain, or to analyze how different business activities are impacting the overall efficiency of the process.

Overall, process cubes are a key concept in multi-dimensional process mining and provide an efficient way to visualize and analyze complex processes across multiple dimensions. By using process cubes, organizations can gain valuable insights into their processes and optimize workflows to improve overall efficiency.
