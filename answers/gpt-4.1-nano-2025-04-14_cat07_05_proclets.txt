The visualization consists of two parts:

1. **A Class Diagram (Part b):**  
   - It illustrates the relationship between two "procelct" classes, showing that one class *requires* the other.  
   - The diagram indicates that one class (requiring) depends on multiple instances (*1..*) of the other class (lab test), and this dependency is represented with associations.

2. **A Sequence Diagram (Part a):**  
   - It depicts the interaction between different entities over time in a laboratory testing process.  
   - The entities include a lab system, lab assistant, chemical analyst, and doctor.
   - The process begins with the lab visit, order entry, blood sample collection, and receipt of the test results.
   - The flow involves multiple steps like judging results, doing tests again if needed, sending reports, and updating results.
   - Flash points include “Order system,” “Receive result,” “Judge results,” “Do tests again,” “Send report,” and “Receive updated result,” with arrows indicating the sequence and flow of actions.
   - The diagram also includes decision points and loops, demonstrating iterative testing and reporting until the lab test is finished.

The bottom of the image provides an example of a performative message sequence within the system, detailing a lab visit, the creation of testing actions, and the scope (private) and direction (OUT) of communication, timestamped at 11:00.
