To identify potential root causes for performance issues based on the provided data, we need to focus on the frequency of certain variants and their associated performances. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **High Performance Variants:**
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 4618, performance = 810187.903)
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 2473, performance = 1084338.407)

2. **Low Performance Variants:**
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 345, performance = 1604595.638)
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 188, performance = 2061236.516)
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 22, performance = 1227602.318)
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 6, performance = 2936133.833)

### Root Causes for Performance Issues:

1. **High Frequency of Rejections and Resubmissions:**
   - The variants with high frequencies of rejections (e.g., rejected by ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR) followed by resubmission often have significantly higher performance times.
   - For example, the variant where a declaration is REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION and then RESUBMITTED has a high frequency (345 + 188 = 533) with relatively poor performance compared to those that do not involve multiple rejections.

2. **Multiple Rejections:**
   - Variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions, such as being rejected by both ADMINISTRATION and SUPERVISOR before final approval, also show high performance times.
   - This suggests that the additional steps of rejection and resubmission are contributing to increased processing time.

3. **Involvement of BUDGET OWNER:**
   - Variants involving multiple approvals (e.g., APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR) have better performance, indicating that this step might be faster or more efficient.
   - The variant where the declaration is APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION and then REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER before final approval also has high performance times.

4. **Administrative Steps:**
   - Variants involving multiple rejections (e.g., rejected by ADMINISTRATION, EMPLOYEE) followed by resubmission often have poor performance.
   - This might indicate inefficiencies in the administrative process or delays at these steps.

### Recommendations:

1. **Reduce Rejection Rates:** Focus on reducing the frequency of rejections to minimize the number of resubmissions and associated delays.
2. **Streamline Administrative Steps:** Investigate why certain steps, such as rejections by ADMINISTRATION, take longer than others.
3. **Optimize Budget Owner Involvement:** Ensure that involving the BUDGET OWNER does not significantly slow down the process.
4. **Automate Rejection Handling:** Implement a system to streamline and automate rejection handling processes to reduce manual delays.

By addressing these specific issues, you can potentially improve the performance of your process.
