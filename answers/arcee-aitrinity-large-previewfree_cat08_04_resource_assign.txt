# Optimizing Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions: A Process Mining Approach

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To comprehensively analyze resource behavior and assignment patterns, I would employ a multi-faceted process mining approach leveraging the rich event log data.

**Key Metrics and Analysis Framework:**

For individual agents, I would calculate:
- **Workload distribution**: Number of tickets handled per hour/day/week, accounting for ticket complexity (priority levels)
- **Processing times**: Average time spent per ticket category and required skill, broken down by tier
- **First-call resolution (FCR) rate**: Percentage of tickets resolved at L1 without escalation
- **Skill utilization**: Frequency of handling tickets requiring each documented skill
- **Reassignment frequency**: Number of times an agent receives reassigned tickets
- **Idle time**: Periods between ticket assignments

For support tiers, I would analyze:
- **Throughput**: Tickets resolved per time unit per tier
- **Escalation rates**: Percentage of L1 tickets escalated to L2/L3
- **Specialization efficiency**: Time to resolution for tickets matching tier expertise vs. those requiring cross-tier collaboration
- **Queue dynamics**: Average wait time in tier queues

**Process Mining Techniques:**

*Resource Interaction Analysis*: Using the event log, I would construct resource flow maps showing how tickets move between agents and tiers. This reveals actual assignment patterns versus intended round-robin logic. I'd identify agents who frequently receive escalated tickets, those who serve as "reassignment magnets," and patterns of cross-tier collaboration.

*Social Network Analysis (SNA)*: By treating ticket handovers as connections between agents, I can build a network graph revealing:
- Central agents who receive many reassignments
- Clusters of agents who frequently collaborate
- Bottleneck agents who create dependencies
- Isolated agents with underutilized skills

*Role Discovery Analysis*: Using conformance checking and clustering algorithms, I would identify emergent roles based on actual behavior patterns rather than predefined tiers. This may reveal that some L1 agents consistently handle complex tickets requiring L2 skills, while some L2 agents perform routine tasks.

*Skill Utilization Analysis*: I would map each agent's documented skills against their actual ticket assignments to identify:
- Specialists working below their skill level (L2/L3 handling routine L1 tasks)
- Skill gaps where certain expertise is in high demand but short supply
- Over-specialization where agents with rare skills become bottlenecks
- Skill redundancy where multiple agents possess identical capabilities but workload is uneven

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Based on the analysis framework above, I would identify specific resource-related problems through targeted investigation:

**Bottlenecks from Skill Scarcity:**
By correlating ticket attributes with agent skill availability, I would identify categories or required skills with consistently longer resolution times or higher SLA breach rates. For example, if "Networking-Firewall" tickets show 40% higher SLA breach rates than average, and only 3 of 15 L2 agents possess this skill, this indicates a skill scarcity bottleneck.

**Reassignment Impact Quantification:**
I would calculate the average delay introduced by reassignments by comparing cases with multiple reassignments against those resolved by the first assigned agent. If tickets with 2+ reassignments take an average of 3.2 hours longer to resolve and have a 65% higher SLA breach rate, this quantifies the reassignment penalty.

**Incorrect Initial Assignment Analysis:**
By examining tickets that required reassignment, I would identify patterns in initial misassignment. If 68% of reassigned tickets were initially assigned to agents lacking the required skill, this indicates a fundamental flaw in the assignment logic.

**Agent Performance Profiling:**
Using process mining dashboards, I would identify:
- Agents with consistently high processing times for their assigned skill categories
- Agents who frequently receive reassigned tickets (suggesting others avoid working with them)
- Agents with idle time despite unassigned tickets in the queue
- Agents who handle tickets outside their documented skill set

**SLA Correlation Analysis:**
I would perform correlation analysis between resource assignment patterns and SLA outcomes. For instance, if tickets assigned to agents with <70% skill match to requirements have a 2.3x higher SLA breach rate, this demonstrates the business impact of skill mismatches.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

**Deficiencies in Assignment Rules:**
The current round-robin approach within tiers ignores both skill requirements and workload. Analysis would likely reveal that tickets requiring specialized skills are assigned to any available agent in the tier rather than the most qualified, leading to immediate reassignments when skill gaps are discovered.

**Inaccurate Skill Profiles:**
By comparing documented skills with actual ticket assignments, I would identify discrepancies. If agents frequently handle tickets requiring skills not in their documented profile, this suggests outdated skill documentation. Conversely, if agents with documented skills rarely receive tickets requiring those skills, this indicates either skill decay or inaccurate documentation.

**Poor Ticket Categorization:**
Analysis of reassignments might reveal that tickets are often misclassified at creation, leading to incorrect skill requirement identification. If 45% of reassigned tickets had initial skill requirements that differed from actual requirements identified during handling, this points to categorization issues.

**Visibility Gaps:**
The process mining analysis would likely reveal that assignment decisions are made without visibility into:
- Current workload of agents with required skills
- Real-time queue lengths across the support organization
- Agent availability (break status, shift patterns)
- Historical performance of agents on similar tickets

**L1 Empowerment Issues:**
High escalation rates from L1 might indicate insufficient training or authority. If L1 agents escalate 78% of P3 tickets requiring specialized skills, this suggests either inadequate training or restrictive escalation policies.

**Variant Analysis for Poor Assignments:**
By comparing variants (case patterns) of tickets with smooth assignments versus those with multiple reassignments, I would identify distinguishing factors:
- Time of day (perhaps certain dispatchers make poorer assignment decisions)
- Ticket creation channel (web portal vs. phone might have different categorization quality)
- Ticket age in queue (older tickets might get assigned to less qualified agents simply because they're available)
- Combination of category and priority (certain combinations consistently lead to poor assignments)

*Decision Mining Application:*
Using decision mining on the event log, I would model the actual assignment decisions made versus the intended logic. This would reveal:
- Non-documented factors influencing assignment decisions
- Decision rules that work well versus those that consistently fail
- Agents or dispatchers who consistently make better assignment decisions
- Situations where manual overrides of the round-robin system succeed or fail

## 4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

**Business Process Simulation:**

Before implementation, I would use discrete event simulation to model the impact of proposed strategies:

- Build a simulation model using mined process maps and resource characteristics
- Incorporate real-world data on ticket arrival patterns, processing times, and skill distributions
- Simulate current state versus proposed strategies to estimate:
  - Changes in average resolution time
  - Expected SLA compliance rates
  - Resource utilization levels
  - Reassignment frequency
- Test different scenarios (demand surges, agent absences, new service offerings)

The simulation would allow testing of strategies in combination (e.g., skill-based routing with workload balancing) and optimization of parameters like proficiency weighting factors or load balancing thresholds.

**Post-Implementation Monitoring:**

I would establish a process mining dashboard for continuous monitoring:

**Key Resource-Related KPIs:**
- Assignment accuracy rate (percentage of tickets assigned to agents with matching skills)
- Skill utilization heatmap (showing which skills are over/underutilized)
- Workload distribution variance (standard deviation of agent workloads)
- Reassignment rate by reason category
- SLA compliance by assignment strategy
- Agent performance trends by category and skill

**Process Views:**
- Real-time resource flow map showing current ticket distribution and movement
- Skill availability dashboard with alerts for critical skill shortages
- Assignment decision log with A/B testing results for different strategies
- Bottleneck detection with predictive alerts
- Customer satisfaction correlation with assignment quality

**Continuous Improvement Cycle:**
- Monthly process mining analysis to identify emerging patterns
- Quarterly strategy refinement based on performance data
- Annual comprehensive review of skill requirements and agent capabilities
- Feedback loop from agents to continuously improve assignment algorithms

This comprehensive approach transforms resource assignment from an intuitive, rule-based process to a data-driven, continuously optimized system that adapts to changing demand patterns and leverages the full capabilities of the support organization.
