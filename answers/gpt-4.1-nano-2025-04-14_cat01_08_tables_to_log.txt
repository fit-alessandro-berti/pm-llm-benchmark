### **Notes & Assumptions:**
- For each order, initial "Order Created" event is inferred from the order date.
- The "Items Picked" events are aligned with the `item_picking_date` for each line.
- Shipment/delivery events are based on the delivery table; if multiple shipments exist, each is logged separately.
- Invoice and payment events are linked to their respective records; if multiple invoices exist for an order, each is registered as a separate event.
- Resources specified are the responsible personnel or entities from the tables.
- Events are ordered chronologically to reflect the typical flow: creation  picking  dispatch  delivery  invoicing  payment.
- When dates are the same or very close, ordering is done by timestamps for accuracy.
- Ambiguities (e.g., multiple invoices per order) are handled by multiple events.

This structured event log can now be used for process mining purposes, providing a clear trace of each order’s lifecycle across activities, actors, and timestamps.
