I can certainly help with that. Based on your given constraints, I would like to suggest a possible model for the process underlining this data. 

The process starts when an employee submits a request (declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE) and subsequently the SUPERVISOR approves it (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR). This approval is then confirmed or approved in writing (Payment Handled), which serves as a notification to the employee. The payment may be made immediately after this, but there's also an option for delay of payment with the approval of the DEPARTMENT head (DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE) and then finally the payment is actually done (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).

However, if the employee disagrees with this decision or feels that there's a delay in payment, they can either respond to it directly or through the approval of another person such as the ADMINISTRATION head (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION) or even the MISSING person. 

In any case, if the employee responds to this disapproval, it leads to a new sequence of events where the payment is either approved and handed over immediately (Payment Handled), or there's an opportunity for further discussions through the approval of another person like the PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION, or MISSING.

If these responses are not resolved satisfactorily, a new sequence emerges where the disapproval may be reversed by the approval of other persons such as BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR, or even DEATH (an alternate success scenario). In case this is unsuccessful, then there's an option for further discussion through the approval of yet another person like the MISSING.

All these discussions culminate in the final decision to either approve or reject the payment based on the overall response/succession pattern observed throughout the process.

I hope this helps you understand the underlying process as described by your constraints!
