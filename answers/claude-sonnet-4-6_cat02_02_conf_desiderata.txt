# Loan Process Compliance Analysis

---

## 1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Violations)

###  Case 1 — No Normative Violations
Case 1 follows the required sequence perfectly:

**Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case**

Every step occurs in the correct order, the loan was approved and documentation was finalized before closing, and no steps were skipped or reversed. This case is fully compliant.

---

###  Case 2 — Multiple Normative Violations

**Violation 1: Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| 08:20 | Risk Assessment  performed FIRST |
| 09:00 | Credit Check  performed SECOND |

- **Rule broken:** *"Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."*
- The risk assessment was conducted without the foundational data that a credit check provides, fundamentally undermining the integrity of the evaluation. The correct order was inverted.

**Violation 2: Finalize Documentation performed after a Rejection**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| 09:30 | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 10:00 | Finalize Documentation  not allowed |

- **Rule broken:** *"If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."*
- Finalizing documentation after a rejection is explicitly prohibited. This action is contradictory to the loan outcome and serves no legitimate purpose within the defined process.

**Summary for Case 2:**
> Case 2 commits **two serious normative violations**: an ordering violation (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and a contradictory action (Finalizing Documentation after rejection).

---

###  Case 3 — No Normative Violations
Case 3 follows the correct sequence for an approved loan:

**Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case**

All steps are in the correct order, and since the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation appropriately precedes Close Case. There are **no strict rule violations**, despite the significant time gaps between activities.

---

## 2. Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal but Not Severe)

###  Case 1 — No Desiderata Violations
- Credit Check completed within 30 minutes of application   Well within the 24-hour recommendation.
- Applicant informed within 2 hours of loan decision   Well within the 48-hour recommendation.
- While a Follow-up Call is not explicitly recorded, Case 1 is otherwise exemplary.

> Case 1 represents **best-practice behavior** and could serve as a benchmark process execution.

---

###  Case 2 — Desiderata Assessment (Overshadowed by Normative Violations)
Although Case 2 has normative violations that are far more serious, for completeness:
- Credit Check was performed 20 minutes after application   Within 24 hours.
- Applicant was informed 30 minutes after the loan decision   Within 48 hours.
- No Follow-up Call recorded   Minor desideratum violation.

> However, the desiderata analysis is largely **moot for Case 2** given the severity of its normative violations.

---

###  Case 3 — Multiple Desiderata Violations

**Desideratum Violation 1: Credit Check completed more than 24 hours after application**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| 2024-01-12 09:00 | Application Received |
| 2024-01-14 10:00 | Credit Check |

- **Gap: ~49 hours** (recommended: within 24 hours)
- This delay is not a rule violation, but it represents a significant lag that could impact customer experience and process efficiency.

**Desideratum Violation 2: Applicant informed more than 48 hours after Loan Decision**
| Timestamp | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| 2024-01-14 12:00 | Loan Decision (Approved) |
| 2024-01-16 15:00 | Inform Applicant |

- **Gap: ~51 hours** (recommended: within 48 hours)
- The applicant was left waiting slightly longer than the recommended window, which is suboptimal for customer satisfaction, though not a serious breach.

**Desideratum Violation 3: No Follow-up Call recorded**
- The recommended Follow-up Call before closing the case was never performed.
- While optional, this call helps ensure alignment between the institution and the applicant, particularly for approved loans where documentation is being finalized.

**Summary for Case 3:**
> Case 3 has **three desiderata violations** — all suboptimal but none constituting a serious process breach.

## 3. Interpretations and Justifications

### Case 2 — Possible Explanations (Without Excusing Violations)

| Violation | Plausible Interpretation |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Risk Assessment before Credit Check | A staff member may have begun the risk assessment using preliminary application data, perhaps due to workload pressure or a misunderstanding of the process sequence. This does not justify the violation but may explain it operationally. |
| Finalize Documentation after Rejection | This may have been an administrative error — perhaps documentation templates were triggered automatically by a system before the rejection decision was properly recorded. Alternatively, a process participant may have been confused about the outcome. |

> **Regardless of the cause**, these are hard-rule violations that require **process correction, staff retraining, or system-level controls** to prevent recurrence.

---

### Case 3 — Possible Explanations for Delays

| Deviation | Plausible Interpretation |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Late Credit Check (~49 hours) | The application may have been received on a Friday (2024-01-12), with the credit check only possible on the next business day (Monday, 2024-01-14) due to weekend operations or third-party credit bureau availability. This is a reasonable real-world justification. |
| Late Applicant Notification (~51 hours) | After the loan decision on 2024-01-14 (Monday), the applicant may not have been reachable until Wednesday (2024-01-16), or internal communication workflows caused a minor delay. Only marginally over the 48-hour recommendation. |
| Missing Follow-up Call | For straightforward approved cases with clear documentation, the team may have deemed the follow-up call unnecessary. While not ideal, this is a low-severity omission. |

> Case 3's deviations are **understandable in a real-world context** and do not undermine the integrity of the process. Nonetheless, effort should be made to adhere to timing guidelines where possible and to institutionalize the follow-up call as a standard step.
