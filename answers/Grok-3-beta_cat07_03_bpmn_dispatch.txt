Certainly! The provided visualization is a flowchart detailing the process of preparing a shipment from the point of initiating the shipment to having it ready for pickup. The flowchart is divided into three main sections: Logistics, Department of Goods & Shipments (Computer), and Warehouse. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:
Logistics Section

Department of Goods & Shipments (Computer) Section
Ship Goods: The process starts with the decision to ship goods.

If special handling is required, it leads to a step that isn't detailed in the diagram.
If not, it proceeds to check if insurance is required.
Check if Insurance is Required: Based on customer information, it is determined whether insurance is necessary.
If insurance is required, it goes back to the Logistics section to insure the parcel.
If not, it proceeds to the next step.
