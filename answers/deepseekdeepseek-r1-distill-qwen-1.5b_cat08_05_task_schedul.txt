### **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

**Using Process Mining**, we can reconstruct the actual flow of jobs and task execution across machines by analyzing the event logs. Metrics like **job flow times**, **task waiting times**, and **resource utilization** (e.g., **machine time**, **Idle time**, **setup time**) will help quantify inefficiencies. For instance, if **machine X** is overloaded with low-priority jobs, it indicates a bottleneck.

- **Job Flow Analysis**: We'll track where each job starts and ends, revealing bottlenecks. Statistical distributions of **job flow times** can show if some jobs consistently take longer.
- **Task Waiting Time Analysis**: Using **task queueing** data, we can identify if certain machines accumulate **task waiting times**.
- **Resource Utilization Insights**: Detailed metrics on **machine time** (planned vs. actual) and **idle time** highlight potential resource contention. **Setup Time Analysis** is crucial, as sequences with long, variable setups require understanding the impact of **sequence-dependent setup times**.

**Diagnosing Pathologies**:
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Metrics like **resource utilization distribution** show where machines are overburdened.
- **Resource S starving**: Monte Carlo simulations using historical data can show if downtimes or establishment times are causing resource depletion.
- **Task Sequence Impact**: Analysis of setup times based on job sequence reveals delays from **sequence-dependent setup times**, such as bottlenecks between certain jobs.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Static Rules Limitation**: Current rules are insufficient for dynamic changes and varying priorities.
2. **Resource Capacity**: Overcrowding on machines, indicated by high resource utilization, is a critical issue.
3. **Unplanned Events**: Unbroken downtimes (like machine breakdowns or new orders) disrupt workflows.
4. **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Simulated scenarios show that static rules may not prioritize tasks effectively.

**Emphasizing Resource Capacity Limitations**:
- **Process Mining Insights**: Unplanned events (e.g., breakdowns) and resource usage metrics can identify these limits early.
- **Existing Rules' Shortcomings**: Static rules may not adapt to delays or sequentially constrained workflows.

**Differentiating Factors**:
- Using historical data to model sequence-dependent setups (e.g., machine learning) is more accurate than rules that may not account for changing conditions.
- Real-time **resource availability** and **job priority** are crucial for evaluating current performance.

### **2. diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

**Process Mining Metrics**:
- **Job Flow Time Distribution**: Density plots show if some jobs take far longer, indicating excessive waiting.
- **Queueing Analysis**: Metrics like **queue height (B)** and **queue depth (Md)** help correlate with **due date slack (Sd)**.

**Patterns Identified**:
- **Job Flow Time Analysis**: If **job flow times are highly variable**,mitter messages are transmitted.
- **Queueing Analysis**: If **queue depth (Md)** approaches interval thresholds, recommend hot jobPL's resolved in real-time.
- **Setup Time Analysis**: If **estimated sequence-dependent setup time** does not align with actual scheduled times at critical machines, target more careful scheduling.

**Hypothesis Testing**:
- Use higher-level metrics to define once for all, such as the percentage of jobs that Tardiness can be reduced to.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Detailed maps of **job flow time**, **queue depth**, and **due date slack** will enable immediate action.
- Patterns and distributions will reveal inefficiencies, leading to actionable insights and fixes.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Inefficiencies**

**Common Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Inadequate Real-Time Visibility**: Machine status, queue lengths, and job progress data are not available to adjust schedules.
2. **Lack of Real-Time Adaptability**: Scheduling decisions made in real-time cannot be adjusted dynamically.
3. **Flexibility of Static Rules**: Static rules may not aggregate information about **batch jobs** or **presence Indicates Machine Dependency (PIMD)**.
4. **Static Operator Assignment**: Operator assignments are fixed, limiting the impact on scheduling resilience.
5. **Inadequate Scheduling Scope**:
   - **Task Precedence**: Poor task placement can lead to delays for high-priority tasks.
   - **Resource Bargeting**: Bargeting without considering leftover resources can cause inefficiencies.

**Identifying Root Causes**:
- ** disruptions Analysis**: Identify disruptive events, like machine breakdowns, and quantify their impact.
- **Priority Changes**: Analyze the impact of priority changes on scheduling flow.
- **Operator-Runtime**: Analyze task rate utilization and its impact on scheduling throughput.

### **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

**Strategy 1**: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Strategies at Workcenters
- Core logic: **remaining processing time**, **due date**, **priority**, **estimated sequence-dependent setup time**, and ** machine load**.
- This strategy assigns optimal tasks based on all available information, considering each machine's load and upstream prior schedules. It adjusts priorities based on due dates or machine availability.

**Strategy 2**: Predictive Scheduling and Scheduling Against Future Events
- Strategy: Mapping historical task durations to better predict Layoff times using historical task duration data.
- It can also map Ave_duration or complexity-dependent setup time.

**Strategy**: Predict Scheduling and Sequence-dependent setup time with real-time processing.
- Schedule not based on static static but on real-time processing of job sequences in workcenters.

**Cumulative Process**:
- Use process mining to analyze the **required performance metrics** (such as deadlines, WIP, and lead times) observed during a simulated change or a critical event.

### **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvements**

**Discrete-Event Simulation**:
- By deriving **task time distributions**, **resource time**, and **expected breakdown sites** from the event logs, a simulation can accurately model and predict the next state.
- Run Scenario Dashboard (RSD) can help simulate before deployment scenarios to assess the effect of a priori changes and a priori changes.

**Simulation of Extraordinary Load**:
- A 20x load scenario can be run to test the impact of high-impact jobs. When schedule additions and techniques competed with performance targets, the simulation can show whether the schedule gets Sponsored.

**Learning from Simulations**:
- It allows an optimal way to determine the degree of deadlockDetermines when to launch a simulation and whether changes lead to a Ranked P pits.

**Continuous Monitoring**:
- Proposed measures to track **WIP**, **lead times, **Tardiness, **Maximum job penalties, and **throughput across different scenarios** and continuously adapt the scheduling strategy based on ongoing performance.

This approach leverages process mining data to generate schedules with optimized performance, quantifying the potential impact of disruptions and limitations, hence enhancing the overall scheduling ability.
