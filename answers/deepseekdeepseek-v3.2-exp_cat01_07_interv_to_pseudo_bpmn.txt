Based on the interview transcripts, here is a structured, BPMN-like textual process model for the Invoice Approval Process.

### **Process: Invoice Approval**

**Primary Roles:**
- **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** (Mary): Process initiator, coordinator, and executor.
- **Purchasing Officer** (Dan): Validates goods/services receipt and invoice details against the Purchase Order (PO).
- **Department Manager** (Carlos): Provides final financial approval.
- **AP Supervisor** (Rita): Handles escalations and exceptions.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Karen): Supports issue resolution with suppliers (secondary/supporting role).

**Key Artifacts/Data Objects:**
- **Input:** Invoice (received via email), Purchase Order (PO)
- **Output:** Approved Invoice, Scheduled Payment

### **Textual Process Model**

**1. Start Event: Invoice Received**
- **Trigger:** An invoice is received by the Accounts Payable department, typically via email.

**2. Task: Check for PO Number**
- **Actor:** AP Clerk
- **Description:** The clerk checks if the invoice contains a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
- **Gateway (Exclusive - XOR): PO Number Present?**
    - **Path A (No PO):** The invoice is missing a PO number.
        - **Task: Request Missing Information**
            - **Actor:** AP Clerk
            - **Description:** The clerk sends the invoice back to the supplier to request the missing PO number. *In some cases, the Purchasing Officer may also inform the clerk that a PO is needed before they can proceed.*
            - **Flow:** The process waits here until the supplier responds. Once a response is received, the process loops back to **Task: Check for PO Number**.
    - **Path B (Yes PO):** The invoice has a valid PO number.
        - **Flow:** Proceed to the next task.

**3. Task: Log Invoice in System**
- **Actor:** AP Clerk
- **Description:** The invoice is entered into the accounting system.

**4. Task: Confirm Goods/Services and Match Details**
- **Actor:** Purchasing Officer
- **Description:** The Purchasing Officer receives the invoice from AP. They confirm that the goods or services were received and match the invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against the original PO.
- **Gateway (Exclusive - XOR): Details Match?**
    - **Path A (No - Discrepancy Found):** There is a mismatch (e.g., incorrect price, wrong quantity).
        - **Task: Initiate Discrepancy Resolution**
            - **Actor:** Purchasing Officer / AP Clerk
            - **Description:** The Purchasing Officer may contact the supplier directly, or the AP Clerk is asked to hold the invoice and contact the supplier for a correction. *The Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) may be looped in at this point to help resolve the issue based on their relationship with the supplier.*
        - **Gateway (Exclusive - XOR): Discrepancy Resolved?**
            - **Path A1 (Yes):** The issue is cleared up (e.g., a corrected invoice is received).
                - **Flow:** Loop back to **Task: Confirm Goods/Services and Match Details** for re-validation.
            - **Path A2 (No - Escalation):** The discrepancy cannot be resolved easily.
                - **Task: Escalate to AP Supervisor**
                    - **Actor:** AP Clerk
                    - **Description:** The AP Clerk escalates the problematic invoice to the AP Supervisor.
                - **Task: Manage Exception**
                    - **Actor:** AP Supervisor
                    - **Description:** The supervisor investigates. This may involve contacting suppliers, coordinating between departments, or working with department heads to create a retrospective PO for non-PO invoices.
                    - **Flow:** Once the exception is managed, the process returns to the normal flow at **Task: Confirm Goods/Services and Match Details**. *Note: For non-PO invoices, this task effectively creates a path to legitimize the invoice, allowing it to proceed.*
    - **Path B (Yes - All Details Match):** The invoice matches the PO perfectly.
        - **Flow:** Proceed to the next task.

**5. Task: Send for Manager Approval**
- **Actor:** System / AP Clerk
- **Description:** The system automatically sends a notification to the Department Manager, containing the invoice, PO, and confirmation details, requesting approval.

**6. Task: Review and Approve Invoice**
- **Actor:** Department Manager
- **Description:** The manager reviews the invoice package. If all details (quantities, pricing, budget alignment) are correct, they approve it in the system.
- **Gateway (Exclusive - XOR): Manager Approval Granted?**
    - **Path A (No - Rejected):** The manager sees an issue (e.g., budget variance, suspicious items).
        - **Task: Investigate and Clarify**
            - **Actor:** Department Manager / AP Clerk
            - **Description:** The manager rejects the invoice and asks the AP Clerk to investigate further. This may trigger a mini-loop back to discrepancy resolution, potentially involving the Purchasing Officer or AP Supervisor.
        - **Flow:** Once clarified, the process loops back to **Task: Send for Manager Approval**.
    - **Path B (Yes - Approved):** The manager grants approval.
        - **Flow:** Proceed to the final task.

**7. Task: Schedule Payment**
- **Actor:** AP Clerk
- **Description:** The approved invoice is scheduled for payment in the next payment cycle.

**8. End Event: Payment Scheduled**
- The process concludes successfully for this invoice.

### **Summary of Ambiguities and Variations Noted**
- **Non-PO Invoices:** The process for invoices without a PO is handled as a major exception by the AP Supervisor, who works to create a retrospective PO or secure approval via an alternate path. This is not the standard flow.
- **Discrepancy Resolution:** The primary actor for initiating contact with the supplier during a discrepancy is not entirely clear; it can be either the Purchasing Officer or the AP Clerk, with the Supplier Relationship Manager acting as a supporting resource.
- **System Role:** The interviews mention a system that sends automated emails for manager approval, but the exact extent of automation in other steps (like logging) is less clear and is modeled based on the clerk's actions.
