Certainly! Below is a DuckDB SQL query that will filter out cases containing more than six events and return only the events from cases that have six or fewer events.

```sql
WITH case_activity_counts AS (
    -- This CTE counts the number of events for each case_id
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
filtered_cases AS (
    -- This CTE filters out cases with more than six events
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM 
        case_activity_counts
    WHERE 
        event_count <= 6
)
-- This query returns the full set of events for the filtered cases
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    filtered_cases fc
ON 
    el.case_id = fc.case_id
ORDER BY 
    el.case_id, 
    el.timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **case_activity_counts CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by counting the rows grouped by `case_id`.
  
2. **filtered_cases CTE**: This CTE filters out cases in `case_activity_counts` where the total number of events (event_count) is greater than six.

3. **Final SELECT**: The main query fetches the events for the cases remaining after the filtering step by joining the `event_log` table with the `filtered_cases` CTE on `case_id`. The results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to ensure that events within a case are in chronological order.

By running this query, you'll get the events from cases that have six or fewer events.
