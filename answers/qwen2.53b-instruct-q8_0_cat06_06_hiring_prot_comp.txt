To analyze the main differences, let's break down and compare the key metrics from both sets of data: registration methods ("FD" for First Floor Department or Front Desk; "ER" for Emergency Room) and the outcomes of treatments.

### Key Metrics:
1. **Frequency**: How many times a particular sequence occurred.
2. **Performance (average performance)**: Sum of individual performances divided by frequency.

### Differences Identified:

#### 1. Registration Method Impact on Frequency and Performance
- **First Floor Department (FD)**
  - More frequent sequences in terms of registration method, suggesting that patients might be more inclined to register at FD for certain types of care.
  - Generally lower performance values across most sequences, which suggests these cases might not have as favorable outcomes. However, there are a few successful outcomes too.
- **Emergency Room (ER)**
  - Fewer but highly varied frequency counts, indicating ER tends to handle more complex and specialized cases that require thorough examinations.
  - Higher average performances, reflecting better overall treatment success rates within the ER.

#### 2. Thorough Examination vs Expert Examination
- The sequence with "Thorough Examination" has generally lower performance values compared to those without it, suggesting these may be less successful treatments.
- However, even within sequences without "Thorough Examination," there are still low-performing cases (like the final one with only expert examination).

#### 3. Treatment Success Rates
- The treatment is more often unsuccessful before it can lead to a discharge, indicating that many patients need multiple rounds of treatment and diagnosis.
  
### Conclusion:
The primary differences lie in the frequency and performance values associated with registration methods and whether there was a thorough or just an expert examination process involved. 

- **Registration at FD** indicates less complex care with potentially lower overall success rates due to higher failure points (lower frequencies).
- **Registration at ER** generally involves more complicated cases which tend to have better average outcomes, despite some high-failure sequences.

#### Summary of Differences:
1. **Frequency and Success Rates**: Patients registered at the Emergency Room typically experience a higher average performance.
2. **Care Complexity**: FD sequences represent less complex care with lower overall success rates, possibly due to more straightforward or less specialized cases being treated there.
3. **Thorough Examination Impact**: Thorough examinations are associated with generally poorer outcomes compared to expert examination alone.

This analysis is based on the provided data and assumes that a higher frequency of something does not inherently indicate its quality (in terms of success); however, the performance values provide an insight into actual treatment effectiveness.
