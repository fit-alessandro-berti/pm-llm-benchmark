Sure, I'd be happy to. Here are some concepts related to Petri nets and their opposites or more general concepts:

1. Source Place: A Source Place is a place in a Petri net from which no transitions can fire. The opposite concept could be a "Sink Place," which is a place in a Petri net to which no transitions can fire.

2. Immediate Transition: An Immediate Transition is a transition in a Petri net that can fire immediately when its input places have tokens. The opposite concept could be a "Delayed Transition," in which the firing of the transition is delayed until a certain condition is met.

3. Live Transition: A Live Transition is a transition in a Petri net that can fire at any point during the execution of the net. The opposite concept could be a "Dead Transition," which is a transition that cannot fire under any circumstances.

4. Bounded Net: A Bounded Net is a Petri net in which the number of tokens in every place is bounded by a constant. The opposite concept could be an "Unbounded Net," in which there is no upper bound on the number of tokens in any place.

5. Free Choice Net: A Free Choice Net is a Petri net in which every place can be marked with any number of tokens. The opposite concept could be a "Restricted Choice Net," in which there are restrictions on the number of tokens that can be marked in certain places.
