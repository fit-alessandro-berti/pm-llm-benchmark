Below I (1) identify recurring activities whose meaning changes by position/context, (2) propose context-aware renames, (3) present the revised event log with the disambiguated activity names, and (4) briefly justify the renaming choices.

1) Recurring activities with context-dependent meanings
- Verify Documents — appears as an initial check (remote or physical) and later as a re-check after either a customer upload or an internal account adjustment.
- Call Customer — used for different intents: request missing docs, clarify discrepancies, confirm adjustments, or ask a customer to return to branch.
- Initiate Request — same activity but different channel (online portal vs branch walkin).
- Adjust Account — performed after a clarification call vs as an internal correction due to missing info.
- Approve Request — always supervisor final approval (kept explicit).

2) Renaming scheme (context-aware)
- Initiate Request (WebPortal) -> Initiate Request (Online Portal)
- Initiate Request (BranchReception) -> Initiate Request (Branch WalkIn)
- Verify Documents (BackOfficeAgent initial) -> Verify Documents — Initial Remote Check
- Verify Documents (BranchOfficer initial) -> Verify Documents — Initial Physical Check
- Verify Documents after upload -> Verify Documents — Re-check After Customer Upload (Remote)
- Verify Documents after account fix -> Verify Documents — Re-check After Account Adjustment (Physical)
- Call Customer (request missing docs) -> Call Customer — Request Missing Documents
- Call Customer (clarify discrepancy) -> Call Customer — Clarify Account Discrepancy
- Call Customer (confirm adjustments) -> Call Customer — Confirm Adjustments
- Call Customer (customer stepped out at branch) -> Call Customer — Request Return to Branch
- Adjust Account (after call clarification) -> Adjust Account — Update After Clarification
- Adjust Account (internal correction) -> Adjust Account — Internal Correction After Missing Info
- Submit Additional -> Customer Upload — ID Scan (Self-Service)
- Approve Request -> Approve Request — Supervisor Final Approval

3) Revised event log (renamed activities)

4) Brief justification (contextual clues)
- Initiate Request: resource differs (WebPortal vs BranchReception)  channel matters for downstream handling (selfservice vs inperson), so include channel in name.
- Verify Documents: repeated occurrences serve distinct purposes:
  - initial checks (remote vs physical) differ by resource and method — made explicit as "Initial Remote Check" vs "Initial Physical Check".
  - later checks occur after a customer upload or after an account correction — renamed to reflect trigger ("Re-check After Customer Upload", "Re-check After Account Adjustment") and method (remote/physical).
- Call Customer: timestamp and Additional Context show different intents (request missing docs vs clarify discrepancy vs confirm updates vs customer stepped out). Each intent is distinct operationally, so the call activity is renamed to state the purpose.
- Adjust Account: context indicates whether the adjustment follows a clarification call (update after clarification) or is an internal correction due to missing info — different cause and likely different processing rules/audit trails.
- Customer Upload and Approve: made explicitly descriptive to show actor (Customer) and role (Supervisor final approval).

If you want, I can:
- produce a process map grouping these renamed activities into typical paths (e.g., Online path with upload branch vs Branch walkin), or
- export this revised log in CSV/Excel format.
