Let’s analyze the current underfitting process tree model for the "Procure-to-Pay" process, identify its issues, propose a corrected version, and explain how the fix enforces the intended behavior.
1. Issues with the Current Model
The current process tree model is defined as:
Sequence: Create_Purchase_Requisition → Approve_Purchase_Requisition → Parallel_Block → Close_Case
Parallel_Block (AND): [Create_Purchase_Order, Receive_Goods, Receive_Invoice, Match_Invoice_to_PO, Pay_Invoice]
Problems Identified:
Parallel Execution of Activities: The Parallel_Block uses the Operator.PARALLEL (AND operator), which means that Create_Purchase_Order, Receive_Goods, Receive_Invoice, Match_Invoice_to_PO, and Pay_Invoice can occur in any order or even simultaneously. This violates the standard "Procure-to-Pay" logic, where activities must follow a specific sequence.
Unwanted Behavior Examples:
Pay_Invoice could happen before Receive_Goods or Receive_Invoice, which is illogical because payment should only occur after goods and invoice are received and matched.
Match_Invoice_to_PO could occur before Receive_Invoice, which is impossible since invoice matching requires the invoice to exist.
Receive_Goods could happen before Create_Purchase_Order, which contradicts procurement rules requiring a purchase order first.
Lack of Dependency Enforcement: The parallel block does not enforce dependencies between activities (e.g., Create_Purchase_Order must precede Receive_Goods).
Required Sequence:
The standard "Procure-to-Pay" process specifies a strict order:
Create_Purchase_Requisition
Approve_Purchase_Requisition
Create_Purchase_Order
Receive_Goods
Receive_Invoice
Match_Invoice_to_PO
Pay_Invoice
Close_Case
While some activities (e.g., Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice) might occur in interchangeable order in real-world scenarios, the subsequent steps (Match_Invoice_to_PO and Pay_Invoice) depend on both being completed. For simplicity and conformance to the "normal, domain-appropriate order," we’ll enforce a fully sequential model unless explicitly stated otherwise.
2. Corrected Process Tree Model
To enforce the proper sequence, we replace the Parallel_Block with a fully sequential structure using Operator.SEQUENCE. Here’s the corrected model in pseudocode:
python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Corrected structure:
# A single sequence enforcing the standard Procure-to-Pay order
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    close_case
])
3. Explanation of the Updated Process Tree
How It Enforces Domain Logic:
Strict Sequential Order: The Operator.SEQUENCE ensures that each activity occurs exactly in the order specified:
Create_Purchase_Requisition initiates the process.
Approve_Purchase_Requisition must follow before proceeding.
Create_Purchase_Order can only occur after approval.
Receive_Goods requires a purchase order to be in place.
Receive_Invoice follows goods receipt (assuming a standard flow).
Match_Invoice_to_PO depends on both the invoice and purchase order.
Pay_Invoice occurs only after matching is complete.
Close_Case finalizes the process.
No Parallelism: By removing the Operator.PARALLEL, the model eliminates the possibility of activities occurring out of order or simultaneously, aligning with the linear dependency chain of the "Procure-to-Pay" process.
Prevention of Unwanted Behavior:
No Payment Before Matching: Pay_Invoice cannot occur before Match_Invoice_to_PO because it is placed after it in the sequence.
No Matching Without Invoice: Match_Invoice_to_PO requires Receive_Invoice to precede it.
No Goods Receipt Without PO: Receive_Goods follows Create_Purchase_Order, ensuring goods are only received against an existing order.
No Early Closure: Close_Case is the final step, preventing premature case closure.
Alternative Consideration:
In some real-world "Procure-to-Pay" processes, Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice could theoretically happen in parallel (e.g., invoice arriving before goods). However:
The problem specifies a "standard logic" with a fixed order (1–8).
Subsequent steps like Match_Invoice_to_PO require both goods and invoice to be present, and Pay_Invoice follows matching.
Thus, a fully sequential model is the simplest and most robust fix for the underfitting issue, avoiding unnecessary complexity (e.g., nested parallel blocks with synchronization).
If flexibility were desired (e.g., allowing Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice in any order), we could introduce a sub-tree with Operator.PARALLEL for those two activities, followed by a sequence for the rest. However, this isn’t indicated as necessary here, so the fully sequential model is optimal.
Conclusion
The corrected process tree replaces the problematic parallel block with a single Operator.SEQUENCE, ensuring all activities occur in the intended order. This eliminates underfitting by enforcing dependencies and preventing illogical behaviors, fully aligning with the domain’s "Procure-to-Pay" logic.
