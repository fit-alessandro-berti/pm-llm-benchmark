Looking closely at the structure, the first oddity is the XOR between the credit check and a silent skip transition. That means the process can either execute a proper credit check or simply bypass it altogether. In real business terms, that's dangerous: without a credit check, you risk approving orders for customers who might not be able to pay, exposing the company to financial loss.

The second structural issue is the LOOP that contains both the approval and invoice issuance steps. A loop here implies that these two activities can be repeated one after the other multiple times before moving on. While in rare cases you might reissue an invoice, the ability to repeatedly re-approve the same order is unusual and inefficient. It suggests either manual error correction or a systemic issue where the process doesn't progress cleanly to the next stage.

These two anomalies together mean the model allows two kinds of undesirable behavior: bypassing a critical risk-control step and creating unnecessary cycles in the approval-invoice phase. In practice, that can lead to risky transactions slipping through and wasted effort as staff repeatedly cycle through the same steps instead of moving forward in the process.
