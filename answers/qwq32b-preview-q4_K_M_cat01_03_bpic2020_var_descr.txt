So I've got this big list of different process variants, each with a frequency and a performance number. It looks like these are variations of some kind of workflow, probably in a company where employees submit declarations or requests, and they go through various approvals before getting paid or something along those lines.

First, I need to make sense of all these steps and understand what's going on at each stage. Let's break it down.

Starting with the most frequent one:

1. Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE

This seems like the initial step where an employee submits a declaration. Maybe it's a expense report or some kind of request that needs approval.

2. Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION

After submission, it goes to the administration for approval. If approved, it moves forward.

3. Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR

Then, it goes to the supervisor for final approval.

4. Request Payment

Once approved by the supervisor, a payment request is made.

5. Payment Handled

Finally, the payment is handled, meaning the request is fulfilled.

That seems like the straightforward path. But looking at the other variants, there are many deviations, such as rejections, additional approvals from a budget owner or pre-approver, and even some loops where declarations are rejected and resubmitted multiple times.

Let's try to map out the possible paths.

First, there's a basic path:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

This is the simplest flow, and it has a high frequency of 4618 with a performance time of 810187.903. Performance probably refers to the total time taken for all these instances combined.

But there are variations where additional approvals are needed, like from a BUDGET OWNER:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

This path has a frequency of 2473 and a higher performance time of 1084338.407, which makes sense because an extra approval step would likely add more time.

There's also a path where the declaration is submitted, approved by administration, then rejected by the supervisor, and then resubmitted:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

This shows that if a supervisor rejects the declaration, it goes back to the employee, who can reject it or resubmit it. In this case, the employee chooses to resubmit, and the process continues until final approval.

There are also paths involving a PRE_APPROVER:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

This suggests that in some cases, there's an additional pre-approval step before going to the supervisor.

Furthermore, there are instances where declarations are saved but not submitted:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> SAVED by EMPLOYEE

With a frequency of 134 and zero performance time, which might mean that employees sometimes save drafts without submitting them.

Rejections can happen at multiple stages:

- REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION

- REJECTED by SUPERVISOR

- REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER

And when a declaration is rejected, it can be either rejected by the employee or resubmitted.

Some paths show multiple rounds of rejection and resubmission, which must be causing delays and increasing the performance time.

For example:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

This path has a higher performance time of 1604595.638, likely due to the additional steps involving rejection and resubmission.

There are also paths where declarations are rejected multiple times before finally being approved, leading to even higher performance times.

Additionally, there are some steps that I don't fully understand yet, like:

- Declaration REJECTED by MISSING

I'm not sure what "REJECTED by MISSING" means. Maybe it refers to missing information or incomplete declarations.

Overall, it seems like the process is somewhat complex, with multiple points of approval and potential rejection, leading to various possible paths and cycles in the workflow.

To better understand this, I think I need to visualize this as a flowchart or a state diagram, where each step is a state, and the transitions between states represent the progression or regression of the declaration through the process.

But given the time constraints, perhaps I can try to summarize the key stages and the possible deviations.

Key Stages:

1. Submission by Employee

2. Approval by Administration

3. [Optional] Approval by Budget Owner

4. [Optional] Approval by Pre-Approver

5. Final Approval by Supervisor

6. Request Payment

7. Payment Handled

Possible Deviations:

- Rejection at any approval stage (Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, Supervisor)

- Resubmission after rejection

- Multiple rounds of rejection and resubmission

- Saving as draft without submission

- Rejection due to missing information

It appears that rejections can lead to the employee either rejecting the declaration altogether or choosing to resubmit it, potentially after correcting issues.

The performance times seem to increase with the number of rejection cycles, which makes sense because each cycle adds more steps and likely more time for corrections and resubmissions.

Some paths show higher frequencies with higher performance times, indicating that certain variations are more time-consuming but also more common.

For instance, the basic path has a frequency of 4618 and a performance time of 810187.903, while a path with an additional budget owner approval has a frequency of 2473 and a higher performance time of 1084338.407.

This suggests that involving more approvers increases the time but is still a common scenario.

Paths with rejection cycles have even higher performance times, indicating significant delays when declarations are not approved on the first try.

There are also some paths that end in rejection, such as:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE

Here, the employee chooses to reject the declaration after it was rejected by administration, which might mean the employee decides to abandon the request.

Alternatively, there are paths where the employee resubmits after rejection, leading to further cycles in the process.

Given this complexity, it might be useful to categorize the processes based on the number of approval levels and the occurrence of rejection cycles.

For example:

- Standard Path: Submission -> Admin Approval -> Supervisor Final Approval -> Payment

- Extended Path: Submission -> Admin Approval -> Budget Owner Approval -> Supervisor Final Approval -> Payment

- Pre-Approval Path: Submission -> Pre-Approver Approval -> Supervisor Final Approval -> Payment

- Rejection Cycle Path: Submission -> Rejection by Admin -> Resubmission -> Approvals -> Payment

Each of these categories would have different frequencies and performance times, and analyzing them separately could provide insights into which parts of the process are most time-consuming or error-prone.

Furthermore, the performance metric seems to be a cumulative time for all instances in a variant. To get an average time per instance, we could divide the performance by the frequency.

For example, for the standard path:

Average performance time = 810187.903 / 4618  175.4 hours per instance

And for the extended path:

Average performance time = 1084338.407 / 2473  438.4 hours per instance

This suggests that involving the budget owner significantly increases the average time per instance.

Similarly, paths with rejection cycles have much higher performance times, indicating that these cases are particularly time-consuming.

For instance, a path with one rejection and resubmission:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

Frequency: 345

Performance: 1604595.638

Average time: 1604595.638 / 345  4651.3 hours per instance

This is substantially higher than the standard path, highlighting the impact of rejection cycles on process efficiency.

Moreover, there are paths with multiple rejection cycles, such as:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

Frequency: 36

Performance: 2542497.917

Average time: 2542497.917 / 36  70625 hours per instance

This is extremely high and suggests that multiple rejection cycles can lead to severe delays.

There are also paths where declarations are rejected but not resubmitted, such as:

SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE

Frequency: 174

Performance: 727139.517

Average time: 727139.517 / 174  4179 hours per instance

Even in cases where the declaration is ultimately rejected, the process takes a significant amount of time.

Comparatively, saving a declaration without submitting it has zero performance time, which makes sense since no further actions are taken.

Looking at these data, it seems that the process is efficient when it follows the standard path without rejections. However, when rejections occur, especially multiple times, the process becomes significantly slower and more cumbersome.

This suggests that there may be room for improvement in the process to reduce the number of rejection cycles, perhaps through better guidance for employees on what is required for approval or stricter quality checks before submission.

Additionally, involving more approvers, such as the budget owner or pre-approver, adds steps to the process and increases the time per instance.

Therefore, depending on the nature of the declarations and the need for additional approvals, the company may want to reconsider whether all these approval levels are necessary for all types of declarations.

Perhaps certain categories of declarations could be configured to require only standard approval, while others that involve larger budgets or specific criteria would require additional approvals.

This way, routine declarations can be processed more quickly, while still maintaining oversight for critical ones.

Furthermore, the "REJECTED by MISSING" step is unclear. If it refers to missing information, perhaps there's a need for better validation at the submission stage to ensure that all required fields are filled out before the declaration is submitted for approval.

This could reduce the number of declarations that are rejected due to incomplete information.

Another observation is that some paths show declarations being finally approved after being rejected and resubmitted multiple times, which indicates that eventually, many declarations that go through rejection cycles are still approved and processed.

However, the time and resources spent on these cycles could be minimized by addressing the issues earlier in the process.

Perhaps implementing a review or validation step before submission could help catch potential errors or missing information early on, reducing the likelihood of rejection later in the process.

Alternatively, providing employees with more detailed guidelines or even automated checks within the submission system could improve the quality of submissions and reduce rejections.

In terms of process optimization, it might be beneficial to analyze which specific reasons lead to rejections at each approval stage and take corrective actions accordingly.

For example, if most rejections by administration are due to missing documentation, then ensuring that employees attach all required documents before submission could streamline the process.

Similarly, if budget owner approvals are often delayed or rejected due to budget constraints, then perhaps there should be better communication between employees and budget owners regarding available budgets before submissions are made.

Another aspect to consider is the sequence of approvals. For instance, involving the budget owner earlier in the process might prevent submissions that are unlikely to be approved due to budget limitations, thus saving time and effort in the approval chain.

Alternatively, if the budget owner's approval is only necessary for declarations above a certain threshold, then configuring the system to route such declarations to the budget owner could optimize the process.

Overall, there seems to be potential for improving the efficiency of this process by reducing rejection cycles and optimizing the approval workflow based on the characteristics of the declarations.

This could lead to faster processing times, reduced administrative burdens, and improved satisfaction among employees who submit declarations.

To summarize, the underlying process involves employees submitting declarations that go through various approval stages, including administration, optional budget owner or pre-approver, final supervisor approval, request for payment, and payment handling.

However, there are numerous variations due to rejections and resubmissions, leading to significant variations in processing times.

By identifying bottlenecks and areas prone to errors, the company can implement process improvements to enhance efficiency and reduce delays.
