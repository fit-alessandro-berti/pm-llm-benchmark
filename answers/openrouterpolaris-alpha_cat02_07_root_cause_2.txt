Great scenario. Let’s keep it focused and data-driven.

1. Which cases take significantly longer?

Compute total lead time from “Submit Claim” to “Close Claim”:

- Case 2001 (A, Low): 2024-04-01 09:00  10:30 (same day)  1.5 hours
- Case 2002 (B, Medium): 2024-04-01 09:05  2024-04-02 11:00  1 day 2 hours
- Case 2003 (A, High): 2024-04-01 09:10  2024-04-03 09:30  2 days 0.5 hours
- Case 2004 (B, Low): 2024-04-01 09:20  10:45 (same day)  1.5 hours
- Case 2005 (B, High): 2024-04-01 09:25  2024-04-04 14:30  3 days 5 hours

Short “baseline” cases:
- 2001 and 2004: fast, straight-through processing (low complexity, no additional docs).

Significantly longer:
- 2002: moderately long.
- 2003: clearly long.
- 2005: longest and most problematic.

2. Attribute-based root cause analysis

a) Complexity

Pattern:
- Low: 2001, 2004  1.5h, no “Request Additional Documents”.
- Medium: 2002  1 doc request, completion in ~1 day.
- High: 2003, 2005  multiple doc requests, multi-day durations.

Details:
- 2003 (High, A):
  - Two “Request Additional Documents” events (11:00, 17:00 on same day).
  - Approval only next day afternoon; payment/closure on day 3.
- 2005 (High, B):
  - Three “Request Additional Documents” events over several days.
  - Approval only on day 4; payment and closure later day 4.

Likely root cause:
- High-complexity claims require more validation and documentation, leading to:
  - Repeated info gaps.
  - Longer waiting times for customers to respond.
  - Additional review cycles before approval.

b) Region (A vs B)

Compare by complexity:

- Low:
  - 2001 (A, Low) vs 2004 (B, Low): both ~1.5 hours  no region issue for low complexity.
- Medium:
  - Only 2002 (B, Medium): ~1 day; reasonable given 1 doc request.
- High:
  - 2003 (A, High): ~2 days.
  - 2005 (B, High): ~3+ days.

Observation:
- Among high-complexity cases, Region B (2005) is slower than Region A (2003).
- Both require multiple “Request Additional Documents”, but B has:
  - More iterations (3 vs 2).
  - Longer spread between requests and final approval.

Possible explanations:
- Region B may:
  - Have less expertise with complex cases (more back-and-forth).
  - Apply stricter or less standardized documentation rules.
  - Suffer from higher workload or slower follow-up on missing docs.

c) Resource-level patterns

Key resources:

- Adjusters:
  - Adjuster_Mike (A): Handles 2001 (fast) and 2003 (high, 2 doc requests).
  - Adjuster_Lisa (B): Handles 2002 (medium, 1 request; OK), 2004 (low; fast), 2005 (high, 3 requests; very slow).
- Managers:
  - Manager_Ann: Approves quickly in 2001, 2002, 2004  no bottleneck.
  - Manager_Bill: Approves 2003 and 2005 (both high complexity, already delayed by doc loops).
- Finance/CSR:
  - Finance_Alan/Carl and CSRs close quickly once approval is done  not causing major delays.

Notable signals:
- Performance issues are not in payment or closure.
- The bottleneck zone is:
  - Between “Evaluate Claim” and “Approve Claim”.
  - Specifically where “Request Additional Documents” repeats.
- Adjuster_Lisa in Region B with High complexity (Case 2005) shows:
  - Multiple incremental document requests instead of one consolidated checklist.
  - This behavior causes the longest lead time.

3. Explanations and mitigation suggestions

a) Complexity-driven loops

Why it happens:
- High-complexity claims need more evidence (medical reports, police reports, invoices).
- If requirements are unclear or requested in fragments, it generates:
  - Multiple “Request Additional Documents” events.
  - Waiting periods between each request/response cycle.

Mitigations:
- Create standardized checklists for high-complexity claims:
  - Ensure the first request is as complete as possible.
- Introduce specialized “Complex Claims” teams:
  - Train adjusters to handle complex cases thoroughly in fewer cycles.
- Use pre-validation:
  - At submission, guide customers to provide typical documents upfront.

b) Region B issues on high complexity

Why it happens (hypotheses from data pattern):
- Less experience with complex claims  more back-and-forth.
- Possible workload or coordination issues causing delayed follow-up.
- Policy interpretation differences compared to Region A.

Mitigations:
- Targeted training for Region B adjusters on high-complexity scenarios.
- Shared best practices from Region A (especially how to structure early doc requests).
- Monitoring:
  - Track “# of document request events per case” by region and complexity.
  - Set thresholds/alerts when more than 2 requests are raised.

c) Adjuster behavior (especially for high complexity)

Why it happens:
- Adjusters may:
  - Request documents reactively as they discover gaps.
  - Lack tools/templates to see all needed information at once.
- This is visible in:
  - 2003 and stronger in 2005: successive doc requests rather than one consolidated request.

Mitigations:
- Decision support for adjusters:
  - Checklists embedded in the system based on claim type and complexity.
- Workflow rules:
  - Encourage “batching” of information requests (one comprehensive request).
- Performance KPIs:
  - Track:
    - Average lead time by adjuster and complexity.
    - Average number of “Request Additional Documents” per case.
  - Use this to coach resources with higher-than-average loops.

Summary

- Long cases: 2002 (moderate), 2003 (long), 2005 (very long).
- Main drivers:
  - High (and to a lesser extent Medium) complexity  more documentation and checks.
  - Repeated “Request Additional Documents” loops are the core bottleneck.
  - Region B and Adjuster_Lisa show the worst performance on high-complexity claims (Case 2005).
- Fixes:
  - Better up-front requirements and standardized checklists.
  - Specialized handling and training for high-complexity claims, especially in Region B.
  - Monitor and minimize repeated document requests to reduce overall lead time.
