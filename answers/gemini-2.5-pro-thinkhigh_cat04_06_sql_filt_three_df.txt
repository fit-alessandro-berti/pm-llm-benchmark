This is an excellent benchmark problem that tests the use of window functions, conditional filtering, and subqueries (or Common Table Expressions) in SQL. Here is a complete and well-structured DuckDB SQL query that solves the prompt.

### **Solution: DuckDB SQL Query**

```sql
-- Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to make the logic clear and modular.

-- Step 1: Create a CTE to get the context of each event.
-- For each event, we use window functions to find its direct predecessor and successor
-- within the same case, ordered by time.
WITH event_context AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        "timestamp",
        -- Get the activity that came just before this one in the same case
        LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS prev_activity,
        -- Get the activity and timestamp that came just after this one
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS next_activity,
        LEAD("timestamp", 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp") AS next_timestamp
    FROM
        event_log
),

-- Step 2: From the context, identify the case_ids that must be excluded.
-- A case is excluded if it contains the specified sequence AND meets the time condition.
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM
        event_context
    WHERE
        -- Condition 1: Find the middle event of our target sequence.
        -- This ensures the sequence is direct, as we are checking the immediate
        -- predecessor and successor.
        prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

        -- Condition 2: Check the time elapsed between the 2nd and 3rd events of the sequence.
        -- (next_timestamp - timestamp) calculates the duration between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.
        AND (next_timestamp - "timestamp") > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

-- Step 3: The final query.
-- Select all events from the original log, but filter out the cases identified in the previous step.
SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    "timestamp"
    -- Add any other columns from event_log here if needed, e.g., SELECT *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY
    case_id, "timestamp"; -- Optional: ordering for readability of the result.

```

### **Explanation of the Logic**

1.  **`event_context` CTE**:
    *   The core of the solution is to analyze events in the context of their neighbors. Window functions are perfect for this.
    *   `PARTITION BY case_id` ensures that we only look at events within the same process instance.
    *   `ORDER BY "timestamp"` is crucial because it establishes the chronological order of events, which is necessary to define a "sequence".
    *   `LAG(activity, 1)` fetches the `activity` from the *previous* row in the partition.
    *   `LEAD(activity, 1)` and `LEAD("timestamp", 1)` fetch the `activity` and `timestamp` from the *next* row.

2.  **`cases_to_exclude` CTE**:
    *   This CTE filters the `event_context` to find rows that represent the *middle* of our target sequence (`activity = 'Create Order'`).
    *   By checking `prev_activity` and `next_activity` on this row, we confirm the complete, direct sequence: `'Approve Purchase Requisition'` -> `'Create Order'` -> `'Confirm Order'`. This is a very efficient way to check for a direct sequence of three events.
    *   We then apply the timing condition. `(next_timestamp - "timestamp")` calculates the time difference between the `Confirm Order` event (whose timestamp is `next_timestamp`) and the `Create Order` event (whose timestamp is on the current row). DuckDB's `INTERVAL` syntax makes this check straightforward.
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` collects all unique case IDs that have at least one instance of this sequence matching the time condition.

3.  **Final `SELECT` Statement**:
    *   The final step is simple. We select all records from the original `event_log` table.
    *   The `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` clause acts as the primary filter, removing all events belonging to any case ID that was identified for exclusion in the `cases_to_exclude` CTE.
    *   An `ORDER BY` clause is added to present the final results in a clean, logical order.
