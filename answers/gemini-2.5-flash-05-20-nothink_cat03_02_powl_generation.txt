from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Define all activities (Transitions)
sr = Transition(label="Service Request (SR)")
cs = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")

# 2. Construct the POWL model piece by piece, following the described steps

# Step 1: Initial SR and CS
# SR followed by CS
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[sr, cs])
root.order.add_edge(sr, cs)

# Step 2: Parallel DA and ACI after CS
# Create a sub-PO for DA and ACI which can run concurrently
parallel_da_aci = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[da, aci]) # No explicit order, so they are concurrent

# Add parallel_da_aci to the root's nodes and link CS to both DA and ACI implicitly via this sub-PO
# We need to make sure both DA and ACI are dependent on CS.
# The simplest way to model this is to add parallel_da_aci as a node to the root,
# and link CS to it. The internal concurrency of parallel_da_aci handles the rest.
# Or, more explicitly:
# We will make CS a predecessor to DA and ACI when they are part of the overall root's strict partial order.
# For now, let's just create these nodes. The dependencies will be built around them.

# Step 3: Looped configuration phase (BNC then optional D&R)
loop_bnc_dr = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[bnc, dr])

# Step 4: Exclusive choice for deployment (CD or MD)
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cd, md])

# Step 5: Partial order for QA and SA
# QA and SA can run concurrently, so they form a StrictPartialOrder without internal edges
parallel_qa_sa = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[qa, sa])

# Now, assemble the overall POWL model using a main StrictPartialOrder
# We'll re-think the root to incorporate all parts and their dependencies.

# Main StrictPartialOrder to orchestrate the entire process
# We will add all top-level elements to this root, and add edges to define the flow.
# Elements that are 'containers' (like loop, xor, sub-POs) become nodes themselves.

# Create the top-level StrictPartialOrder
# The nodes here will be the main sequential or partially ordered blocks/activities
main_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[sr, cs, da, aci, loop_bnc_dr, xor_deployment, parallel_qa_sa, gla])

# Define the partial order dependencies
# 1. SR -> CS
main_process.order.add_edge(sr, cs)

# 2. CS -> (DA and ACI concurrently)
# This means CS must complete before DA and ACI start.
# Since DA and ACI are direct nodes in 'main_process', we can add edges directly.
main_process.order.add_edge(cs, da)
main_process.order.add_edge(cs, aci)

# 3. (DA and ACI) -> Loop (BNC, D&R)
# Both DA and ACI must be completed before loop_bnc_dr can start.
main_process.order.add_edge(da, loop_bnc_dr)
main_process.order.add_edge(aci, loop_bnc_dr)

# 4. Loop (BNC, D&R) -> XOR (CD, MD)
main_process.order.add_edge(loop_bnc_dr, xor_deployment)

# 5. XOR (CD, MD) -> (QA and SA concurrently)
# The output of the XOR (i.e., either CD or MD completing) must precede both QA and SA.
# Since parallel_qa_sa is a container for QA and SA, we link the XOR to this container.
main_process.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, parallel_qa_sa)

# 6. (QA and SA) -> GLA
# Both QA and SA must complete before GLA.
main_process.order.add_edge(parallel_qa_sa, gla)

# The final POWL model is 'main_process'
# You can now work with 'main_process' as the root of your model.
# For demonstration purposes, we can print its structure (though pm4py doesn't have a direct print function for complex POWL).
# print(main_process) # This won't give a meaningful output without custom serialization.
