Proposed High-level View of the Manufacturing Process
=====================================================

High-level step 0        | Constituent low-level events (orderagnostic)                                                                  | Why they belong together
-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Material preparation  | Retrieve raw metal sheet•Scan barcode•Place metal sheet on table•Align metal sheet•Pre-heat metal sheet | All actions are: (a) executed immediately after the raw part is issued, (b) use “logistics / positioning” resources (Operator A, Robot Arm, Heating Unit #1) and (c) leave the sheet in a ready-to-weld physical state. None of the following steps can start before this bundle is finished.
2. Welding assembly      | Pick-up welding tool•Weld corner A•Weld corner B                                                           | Short, uninterrupted time window (15 s) carried out by the same resource class (Operator B + welding tool). The activities transform the part mechanically, producing the welded seams.
3. In-process weld QA    | Measure weld integrity                                                                                          | This single sensor reading closes the welding stage; semantically it is quality control and temporally it is always the first non-operator activity after welding.
4. Surface finishing     | Apply protective coating•Dry coating                                                                          | Both actions manipulate the surface only, use coating/curing equipment, and occur directly one after the other before the part is touched again by a human.
5. Final visual QA       | Visual check                                                                                                    | Human confirmation that all previous steps were successful; it is the last event of every case and has no physical transformation purpose.


Practical Rules for Automatically Building the Groups
-----------------------------------------------------

Rule R1  (start of a case)   
IF Activity = “Retrieve raw …” THEN open new group “Material preparation”.

Rule R2  (within preparation)   
WHILE Activity  {Scan barcode, Place metal sheet, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet}   
assign to current “Material preparation”.

Rule R3  (transition to welding)   
IF Activity = “Pick up welding tool” THEN open “Welding assembly”; keep assigning subsequent events executed by the *same human resource* within t  30 s until Activity NOT LIKE “Weld%”.

Rule R4  (weld quality)   
IF Activity LIKE “Measure weld integrity” THEN open/append to “In-process weld QA”.

Rule R5  (surface finishing)   
IF Activity LIKE “Apply protective coating” THEN open “Surface finishing” and include contiguous events executed by coating/curing equipment until Activity = “Dry coating”.

Rule R6  (final QA)   
IF Activity LIKE “Visual check” AND it is the last event of the case THEN open “Final visual QA”.

(Other cases in the full log follow the same patterns; time-gap and resource heuristics can be tuned.)

JSON-like Mapping for Implementation
------------------------------------

```json
{
  "Material preparation": [
      "Retrieve raw metal sheet",
      "Scan barcode",
      "Place metal sheet on table",
      "Align metal sheet",
      "Preheat metal sheet"
  ],
  "Welding assembly": [
      "Pick up welding tool",
      "Weld corner A",
      "Weld corner B"
  ],
  "In-process weld QA": [
      "Measure weld integrity"
  ],
  "Surface finishing": [
      "Apply protective coating",
      "Dry coating"
  ],
  "Final visual QA": [
      "Visual check"
  ]
}
```

Aggregated Timeline Example (Case A1)
-------------------------------------

Timestamp (start-end)          | High-level step           | Duration | Outcome / key data
--------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-------------------
08:00:05 – 08:00:20            | Material preparation      | 15 s     | Sheet M-045 pre-heated to 200 °C
08:01:00 – 08:01:10            | Welding assembly          | 10 s     | Two spot welds placed with tool W-12
08:01:20 – 08:01:20            | In-process weld QA        | <1 s     | IntegrityScore = 95
08:01:30 – 08:01:45            | Surface finishing         | 15 s     | Polyurethane coat cured at 120 °C
08:02:00 – 08:02:00            | Final visual QA           | <1 s     | Passed

Why this High-level Structure is Useful
---------------------------------------

1. Reduces more than a dozen sensor/operator events to five understandable phases.  
2. Lets analysts compare cases on a phase-by-phase basis (e.g., welding time variance).  
3. Provides a natural skeleton for process mining, KPI dashboards and scheduling.  
4. Facilitates conformance checks (e.g., a coating should never appear before weld QA).  
5. Makes it easy to enrich with performance metrics (mean duration, defect rate) without drowning in raw event noise.

You can now feed the rules above to an ETL job (SQL/ Python / ProM) and automatically obtain one row per case and high-level activity, or create hierarchical process models in BPMN/ Petri nets.
