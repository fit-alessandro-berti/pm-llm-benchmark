Proposed HighLevel Process Model

1. Material Preparation  
   Lowlevel events:  
     • Retrieve raw metal sheet  
     • Scan barcode  
     • Place metal sheet on table  
     • Align metal sheet  
     • Preheat metal sheet  
   Rationale:  
     All actions happen backtoback (20 s apart), are carried out by “frontend” resources (Operator A, Robot Arm, Heating Unit #1) and have one clear goal: get one sheet ready for transformation.  

2. Welding Assembly  
   Lowlevel events:  
     • Pick up welding tool  
     • Weld corner A  
     • Weld corner B  
   Rationale:  
     The welding tool pickup is an obvious anchor; everything that follows with the same tool and operator is the physical joining operation on that sheet. Gaps between activities are <10 s and no other resource type is involved.  

3. Inline Weld Quality Check  
   Lowlevel events:  
     • Measure weld integrity  
   Rationale:  
     A dedicated quality sensor immediately follows welding (<15 s). Although it is a single event, it represents a conceptually distinct phase (automated conformance test) and is always executed by a qualityassurance resource class.  

4. Surface Protection (Coating & Drying)  
   Lowlevel events:  
     • Apply protective coating  
     • Dry coating  
   Rationale:  
     Both events use surfacefinishing equipment, are sequential (<20 s apart) and have the shared goal of adding and curing a coating layer.  

5. Final Visual Inspection & Release  
   Lowlevel events:  
     • Visual check  
   Rationale:  
     This human confirmation takes place only after coating is finished and is the last event before the item leaves the workcell.

How to Apply on the Full Log

Rule set (can be automated):

1. Sort events of each CaseID chronologically.  
2. Use the startanchors above to open a new highlevel step; continue assigning events to that step until the corresponding endanchor appears.  
3. Collapse the collected events into a single record whose starttime is the first event and endtime is the last event of the group; carry across any useful aggregated info (e.g., temperature range during “Material Preparation”).  
4. Proceed until the end of the trace.  

Resulting aggregated trace (Case A1)

Material Preparation      08:00:05 – 08:00:20  
Welding Assembly          08:01:00 – 08:01:10  
Inline Weld Quality Check08:01:20 – 08:01:20  
Surface Protection        08:01:30 – 08:01:45  
Final Inspection & Release08:02:00 – 08:02:00  

The same pattern cleanly appears for Case B2 and for the remaining cases in the full log, producing a concise, businesslevel view of the manufacturing workflow.
