1. How does the company balance design innovation in R&D with the constraints and lead times of geographically dispersed component suppliers?  

2. In what ways could disruptions at a single critical supplier (e.g., the microprocessor plant in Taiwan) propagate through the entire supply chain, and how can the company systematically quantify and mitigate this risk?  

3. How are supplier performance metrics (quality, on-time delivery, cost, sustainability) incorporated into ongoing sourcing decisions, and what trade-offs are made when a supplier excels in some dimensions but underperforms in others?  

4. What strategies could be implemented to improve visibility and real-time tracking of components as they move from multiple international suppliers to the Malaysian assembly plant, and how would that affect production scheduling?  

5. How can the assembly plant optimize capacity utilization (shifts, labor, machinery) while remaining flexible enough to respond quickly to sudden demand changes or component shortages?  

6. In what ways might quality assurance protocols differ across stages (component inspection, in-line manufacturing checks, final testing, post-sale returns), and how can insights be shared across these stages to prevent recurring defects?  

7. How should the company decide when to use air freight versus sea freight for different markets, considering cost, lead time, demand volatility, and environmental impact?  

8. What are the key challenges in coordinating customs, regulatory compliance, and documentation across multiple jurisdictions, and how might digitalization or standardization reduce delays and errors?  

9. How can the company design its just-in-time replenishment strategy to avoid stockouts in high-demand markets without overly increasing exposure to transportation or supplier disruptions?  

10. For slower-moving markets, how can the firm determine the optimal shipment frequency and size to balance inventory carrying costs against service levels and responsiveness to local demand changes?  

11. How might machine learning models be used not only for demand forecasting but also for dynamic safety stock calculation, supplier risk assessment, or proactive identification of potential bottlenecks?  

12. What governance and data quality mechanisms are needed to ensure that the digital systems (ERP, WMS, TMS, planning tools) produce consistent, reliable information across all regions and partners?  

13. How does the company ensure compliance with varying environmental regulations (e.g., e-waste, packaging, carbon reporting) across countries, and what opportunities exist to harmonize or exceed these standards for competitive advantage?  

14. In what ways can labor regulations and working conditions at the Malaysian assembly plant and at suppliers’ facilities affect both operational performance and brand reputation, and how can these factors be monitored and improved?  

15. How should warranty and after-sales support data (failure rates, repair types, return reasons) be fed back into product design, supplier selection, and process improvements along the supply chain?  

16. What contingency planning and scenario analysis practices can help the company prepare for geopolitical events, trade restrictions, pandemics, or natural disasters that might affect specific nodes or lanes in the network?  

17. How could the company redesign its network of distribution centers and warehouses to reduce carbon footprint while maintaining or improving delivery speed and reliability?  

18. What are the ethical and strategic implications of using advanced analytics and automation (e.g., AI-driven planning, robotic warehouses) on workforce roles, required skills, and employment in different regions?  

19. How can collaboration and data sharing with key retailers, e-commerce platforms, and logistics partners be structured to improve forecast accuracy, reduce bullwhip effects, and enable more agile replenishment?  

20. If the company decided to offer more customization options (e.g., memory size, color, region-specific features), how would this affect complexity, inventory policies, supplier relationships, and the overall design of the supply chain?
