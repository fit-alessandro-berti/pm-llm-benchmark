We need to produce two POWL models in textual description, not actual code? The user wants to "produce two POWL models". They gave example code. Likely they expect a code snippet for each model, showing the structure. Provide two code blocks, each constructing the model using pm4py objects. Must reflect the described steps.

Model 1: includes XOR after skill assessment: one branch standard CulturalFitCheck, other branch CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives advantage). So after SkillAssessment, we have XOR node with children CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then after that, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision.

Also need loop for data completeness: after ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck, then loop with RequestMoreInfo and DataCompletenessCheck? The description: "Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check" includes loop: missing info triggers request more info then back. So we can model loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Or loop node with children A (DataCompletenessCheck) and B (RequestMoreInfo). Actually loop operator: execute A, then either exit or execute B then A again. So A = DataCompletenessCheck, B = RequestMoreInfo.

Sequence: ReceiveApplication -> loop (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) -> SkillAssessment -> XOR (CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

Model 2: same but no XOR branch; just CulturalFitCheck after SkillAssessment. So after SkillAssessment, just CulturalFitCheck (no XOR). Then ManagerialReview, FinalDecision.

We need to present code for each model. Use appropriate imports. Provide comments.

Make sure to use Operator.XOR and Operator.LOOP from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.

Also ensure formatting: code blocks with python.

We also need to ensure LaTeX for any math? Not needed.

Provide final answer with two code snippets and brief description.

Let's craft.

Below are two **POWL** models that encode the hiring workflow described in the prompt.  
Both models contain the same initial loop for data‑completeness and the same sequential steps after the skill test.  
The **first model** introduces an **XOR** branch that gives a subtle advantage to applicants with a community affiliation (the source of the potential unfairness).  
The **second model** removes that branch – every candidate follows the same cultural‑fit evaluation, eliminating the bias point.

## 1️⃣ Model *with* Potential Unfairness  

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import (
    StrictPartialOrder,
    OperatorPOWL,
    Transition,
    SilentTransition,
)
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# ----- Activities -------------------------------------------------
receive_app          = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check           = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info    = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment     = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit         = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affil_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review    = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision       = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# ----- Loop for missing data ---------------------------------------
# Execute DataCompletenessCheck; if info missing, request more info and repeat.
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_more_info],
)

# ----- XOR after the skill test (bias point) -----------------------
# Either a standard cultural‑fit evaluation or a community‑affiliation check
# that can give a subtle uplift.
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[cultural_fit, community_affil_check],
)

# ----- Overall partial order (sequential flow) --------------------
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        receive_app,
        data_loop,
        skill_assessment,
        cultural_xor,
        managerial_review,
        final_decision,
    ]
)

# Define the required ordering
root.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_xor)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

# The variable `root` now holds the POWL model with the potential unfairness.
```

### What makes this model unfair?
* After the **SkillAssessment**, the **XOR** node offers two mutually exclusive paths:
  * **CulturalFitCheck** – the neutral evaluation used for all candidates.
  * **CommunityAffiliationCheck** – a special branch that adds a (subjective) advantage for applicants who belong to the “Global Business Leaders Club” or are flagged as local residents.  
  Because the choice is exclusive, the presence of the second branch can tilt the overall outcome for those applicants.

## 2️⃣ Model *without* Unfairness  

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import (
    StrictPartialOrder,
    OperatorPOWL,
    Transition,
    SilentTransition,
)
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# ----- Activities -------------------------------------------------
receive_app          = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check           = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info    = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment     = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit         = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")   # single, unbiased path
managerial_review    = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision       = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# ----- Loop for missing data ---------------------------------------
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[data_check, request_more_info],
)

# ----- No XOR – every candidate follows the same cultural‑fit step --
# (the bias‑introducing branch is omitted)

# ----- Overall partial order (sequential flow) --------------------
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        receive_app,
        data_loop,
        skill_assessment,
        cultural_fit,
        managerial_review,
        final_decision,
    ]
)

# Define the required ordering
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

# The variable `root_fair` now holds the unbiased POWL model.
```

### How unfairness is eliminated
* After **SkillAssessment**, the workflow proceeds directly to a **single** `CulturalFitCheck` activity.  
* No exclusive choice (XOR) or special “CommunityAffiliationCheck” exists, so every applicant is evaluated on the same criteria, removing the source of the subtle bias.

Both snippets can be executed in a Python environment with **pm4py** installed. The resulting `root` (biased) and `root_fair` (unbiased) objects are ready for further analysis, visualization, or conformance checking.
