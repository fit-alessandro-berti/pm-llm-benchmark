 Certainly! Let's break down the constraints and infer a high-level description of the business process they represent.

### Key Activities and Their Roles:
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** - The employee submits a declaration.
2. **Request Payment** - A request for payment is made, likely after submission but before final approval.
3. **Payment Handled** - Indicates that the payment process has been handled.
4. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** - The declaration is finally approved by the supervisor.

### Constraints and Their Implications:

#### Initialization:
- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: Every trace must start with this activity. This sets the process in motion.

#### Sequence of Events (Succession):
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**  **Request Payment**
   - The employee's submission leads to a request for payment.
2. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**  **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
   - Eventually, the declaration is approved by the supervisor.
3. **Request Payment**  **Payment Handled**
   - The request for payment leads to handling the payment.
4. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**  **Payment Handled** (Chain succession)
   - Final approval of the declaration directly leads to handling the payment.
5. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**  **Payment Handled**
   - Indirectly, the submission can lead to payment being handled through intermediate steps.
6. **Request Payment**  **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
   - A request for payment might necessitate the final approval of the declaration.

#### Response and Request Handling:
- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** triggers a need to process requests for payments and handle them accordingly. This leads to eventual supervisor approval and handling of payment.

#### Coexistence:
- Several activities can occur simultaneously or are dependent on each other, such as:
  - **Request Payment**, **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**, and **Payment Handled** all relate to the processing of the declaration post submission.

#### Absence:
- Certain activities like **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION**, etc., are not present in this process model, implying they are not relevant to the described sequence of events.

### High-Level Process Description:
The process starts when an employee submits a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`). This submission triggers a series of actions:

1. A **Request Payment** is made, indicating that financial processing needs to occur.
2. The declaration then undergoes final approval from the supervisor (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
3. Upon final approval, the payment is handled (`Payment Handled`), concluding the financial aspect of the process.

Throughout this sequence, various activities can coexist and interact in specific ways defined by the constraints. This model ensures that every submission leads to a clear path of requesting and handling payments, culminating in supervisory approval.
