### Assumptions
1. **Resources/Actors**: Resources (individuals and departments) involved in each event are inferred from resource tables.
2. **Chronological Order**: Events are listed in the chronological order based on timestamps provided.
3. **Data Integrity**: All events associated with an `order_id` are included, ensuring a complete representation of the order's lifecycle.
4. **Activity Names**: Events are logically derived based on the table contexts and relationships.

This event log captures each step in the order process lifecycle, from creation through items picking, delivery, invoicing, and payment, providing a complete and detailed view for process mining.
