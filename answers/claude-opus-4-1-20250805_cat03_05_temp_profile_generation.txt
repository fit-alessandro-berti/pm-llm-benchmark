Based on the global supply chain process for high-tech electronics manufacturing, I'll create a temporal profile dictionary with realistic time estimates for various activity pairs. The times reflect typical durations in such processes, considering factors like international shipping, quality control procedures, and manufacturing complexities.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct sequential pairs (activities that typically follow immediately)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 1800),        # 2 hours avg, 30 min std (negotiation and decision)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),    # 7 days avg, 2 days std (supplier lead time)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 900),         # 1 hour avg, 15 min std (immediate inspection)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 3600),       # 4 hours avg, 1 hour std (staging and prep)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (1800, 600),         # 30 min avg, 10 min std (immediate testing)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),        # 2 hours avg, 30 min std (cooling and prep)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1800, 300),         # 30 min avg, 5 min std (internal transport)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),      # 1 day avg, 12 hours std (order fulfillment)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 1209600),  # 30 days avg, 14 days std (post-delivery)
    
    # Activities separated by one step
    ('SS', 'RC'): (612000, 173700),    # ~7.1 days avg (SS->OP->RC)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (608400, 172890),    # ~7.04 days avg (OP->RC->QI)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (18000, 4500),       # 5 hours avg (RC->QI->CA)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (16200, 4200),       # 4.5 hours avg (QI->CA->PT)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (9000, 2400),        # 2.5 hours avg (CA->PT->PK)

    # Activities separated by eight steps
    ('SS', 'AS'): (3319800, 1480200),  # ~38.42 days avg
}
```

This temporal profile represents a comprehensive view of the supply chain process where:
- Early stages (SS, OP) have relatively short durations between them
- Component receipt (RC) involves significant lead time from suppliers
- Manufacturing activities (QI, CA, PT, PK) happen relatively quickly in sequence
- Distribution and after-sales support involve longer timeframes
- The standard deviations reflect realistic variability in supply chain operations, with international shipping and supplier dependencies showing higher variation
