Okay, so I need to figure out which events belong to the same case, or patient journey, even though there's no explicit case ID. Let's start by listing out all the events and see what attributes we can use to group them.

First, I notice that each event has a timestamp, activity, resource, department, patient age, patient gender, and additional info. Since these are separate patient journeys, I can probably group them by patient age and gender, but I should be careful because multiple patients could have the same age and gender. But maybe the sequence of activities and departments can help distinguish them.

Let's list out the events with their key attributes:

1. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: insurance=private
2. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: insurance=public
3. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: insurance=private
4. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z, activity: Initial triage, resource: Nurse Joy, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: triage_code=3
5. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z, activity: Initial triage, resource: Nurse Mark, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: triage_code=2
6. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery
7. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, resource: Radiology Tech, department: Radiology, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: body_part=left_leg
8. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, activity: Lab test requested, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: test_type=blood_panel
9. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Surgery preparation, resource: Surgical Nurse, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: prep_type=general_anesthesia
10. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, activity: Lab test completed, resource: Lab Technician, department: Laboratory, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: results=normal_levels
11. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection
12. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture
13. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, activity: Surgery performed, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: procedure=arthroscopy
14. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, activity: Prescription created, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: medication=antibiotics
15. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, additional_info: followup=outpatient_clinic
16. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, activity: Recovery room, resource: Recovery Nurse, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: condition=stable
17. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: followup=pharmacy_pickup
18. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: followup=physiotherapy_sessions

Okay, so we have three distinct patient registrations at the beginning (events 1, 2, 3), each with different ages and genders:
- Event 1: 45-year-old male, ER department, private insurance
- Event 2: 62-year-old female, ER department, public insurance
- Event 3: 28-year-old male, Surgery department, private insurance

Now, let's see how the subsequent events align with these initial registrations.

Starting with the 45-year-old male (Event 1):
- Event 1: Register patient (ER)
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER, same age and gender)
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology, same age and gender)
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, same age and gender, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER, same age and gender)

That seems to form a complete journey for the 45-year-old male: registration, triage, X-ray, doctor consultation, discharge.

Next, the 62-year-old female (Event 2):
- Event 2: Register patient (ER)
- Event 5: Initial triage (ER, same age and gender)
- Event 8: Lab test requested (ER, same age and gender)
- Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory, same age and gender)
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, same age and gender, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER, same age and gender)
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER, same age and gender)

This also forms a complete journey: registration, triage, lab test requested, lab test completed, doctor consultation, prescription, discharge.

Finally, the 28-year-old male (Event 3):
- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery)
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery, same age and gender, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery, same age and gender)
- Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery, same age and gender)
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery, same age and gender)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, same age and gender)

This journey makes sense as well: registration, doctor consultation, surgery preparation, surgery performed, recovery room, discharge.

Now, let's check if there are any events that don't fit into these three groups or if any events could belong to multiple groups. All events seem to fit neatly into one of the three groups based on age, gender, and department.

To confirm, let's list the events by case:

**Case 1: 45-year-old male**
- Event 1: Register patient (ER)
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER)
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology)
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER)

**Case 2: 62-year-old female**
- Event 2: Register patient (ER)
- Event 5: Initial triage (ER)
- Event 8: Lab test requested (ER)
- Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory)
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER)
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER)
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER)

**Case 3: 28-year-old male**
- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery)
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery)
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery)
- Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery)
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery)

Everything seems to fit nicely. The departments and activities align with what you'd expect for each patient's journey. For example, the 28-year-old male is in the Surgery department throughout his journey, which makes sense given the surgery-related activities. The other two cases are in the ER department, which aligns with their activities like triage, lab tests, and consultations.

One thing to note is that the 45-year-old male's journey includes an X-ray, which is consistent with the diagnosis of a hairline fracture (Event 12). The 62-year-old female's journey includes lab tests and a prescription for antibiotics, consistent with a minor infection diagnosis (Event 11). The 28-year-old male's journey is all about surgery, from preparation to recovery.

There are no overlapping events or attributes that would suggest any mixing between the cases. Each case has a unique combination of age, gender, and department trajectory.

So, we can confidently group the events into three separate cases based on these attributes and the logical sequence of activities.

Based on the event attributes and their logical sequence, the events can be grouped into three separate cases as follows:

**Case 1: 45-year-old male (ER department)**
- Event 1: Register patient
- Event 4: Initial triage
- Event 7: X-ray imaging
- Event 12: Doctor consultation
- Event 15: Patient discharged

**Case 2: 62-year-old female (ER department)**
- Event 2: Register patient
- Event 5: Initial triage
- Event 8: Lab test requested
- Event 10: Lab test completed
- Event 11: Doctor consultation
- Event 14: Prescription created
- Event 17: Patient discharged

**Case 3: 28-year-old male (Surgery department)**
- Event 3: Register patient
- Event 6: Doctor consultation
- Event 9: Surgery preparation
- Event 13: Surgery performed
- Event 16: Recovery room
- Event 18: Patient discharged

Thus, the events are grouped into three distinct cases based on patient age, gender, department, and the sequence of activities:

- Case 1: Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- Case 2: Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- Case 3: Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

```markdown
| Case ID | Events                                                                 |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Case 1  | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15                                                        |
| Case 2  | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17                                                |
| Case 3  | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18                                                    |
```
The events are grouped into three distinct cases as shown in the table above.
