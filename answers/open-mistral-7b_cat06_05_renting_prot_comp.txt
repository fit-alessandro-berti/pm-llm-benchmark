Based on the provided data, there are several differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. Process Variants: The protected group has more complex processes with more steps compared to the unprotected group. This includes variants with extensive screening, contract signing, and multiple rent payments before cancellation.

2. Frequency: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants that involve directly rejecting prospective tenants (Reject Prospective Tenant or Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant), while the protected group has fewer of these variants.

3. Performance: The unprotected group generally has shorter execution times for their process variants, especially those that involve direct rejection of prospective tenants. The protected group's process variants have longer execution times, which may indicate more time-consuming processes.

4. Cancellation Steps: The protected group has more complex cancellation processes, often involving multiple rent payments before cancellation, while the unprotected group's cancellation process is simpler and often involves fewer steps.

These differences suggest that the protected group may be subjected to more rigorous screening and contractual processes, and their cancellations may involve more steps and time. This could potentially indicate unfair treatment if these processes are not necessary or justified by the protected status of the group. However, a detailed analysis of the reasons for these differences would be needed to draw definitive conclusions.
