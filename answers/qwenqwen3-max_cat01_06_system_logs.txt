### Explanation of Logic

#### **Case Identification**
I grouped events into **cases based on the document or task context** that the user is actively working on. Each case represents a coherent unit of work centered around a specific file or communication thread:
- `DOC_Document1.docx`: All events related to editing, saving, and closing “Document1.docx”.
- `EMAIL_AnnualMeeting`: Events tied to handling a specific email thread (from opening to sending reply).
- `PDF_Report_Draft.pdf`: Activities focused on reviewing and annotating the PDF file.
- `XL_Budget_2024.xlsx`: Events related to updating and saving the budget spreadsheet.
- `DOC_Quarterly_Report.docx`: Events for editing and closing the quarterly report document.

This approach treats each document/email as a “case” because user interactions are logically bounded by the context of that artifact. Switching between apps/files marks transitions between cases.

> **Note**: The initial `FOCUS` event on `Quarterly_Report.docx` at 08:59:50 was not included as a case start because no subsequent editing or saving occurred until after `Document1.docx` was closed — suggesting it was merely opened or glanced at. The case begins at 09:07:15 when active editing starts.

#### **Activity Naming**
I transformed raw system actions into **standardized, semantically meaningful activity names** suitable for process analysis:
- `FOCUS` + document  “Open Document” or “Return to Document” (depending on context)
- `TYPING`  “Draft Content”, “Compose Email Response”, “Update Financial Data”, etc. — contextualized by application and content.
- `CLICK` + “Reply”  “Reply to Email”; `CLICK` + “Send”  “Send Email”
- `SAVE`  “Save Document” or “Save Spreadsheet” (contextualized)
- `SWITCH`  “Switch to [Context]” to show workflow transitions
- `SCROLL`/`HIGHLIGHT`  Descriptive names indicating review behavior

This ensures activities reflect user intent and task semantics rather than low-level system events.

#### **Event Attributes**
Each event includes:
- **Case ID**: Unique identifier based on document/email context (e.g., `DOC_`, `EMAIL_`, `PDF_`, `XL_` prefixes for clarity).
- **Activity Name**: High-level, standardized process step.
- **Timestamp**: Preserved from original log.
- **Application & Document/File**: For context and filtering.
- **Additional Info**: Key typed or action detail when semantically important.

#### **Narrative Coherence**
The resulting event log tells a clear story of a user’s morning workflow:
1. Starts drafting a new document (`Document1.docx`)
2. Switches to handle an urgent email
3. Reviews a PDF report and highlights key findings
4. Updates a budget spreadsheet
5. Returns to insert budget reference into the original document
6. Closes that document and begins drafting the quarterly report

This structure enables analysis of task durations, switching behavior, document handling patterns, and bottlenecks — all core use cases in user interaction process mining.
