     - **Tool Position:** 0 mm (tools are in the home position).
     - **Energy Consumption:** Around 0.45-0.50 kWh (baseline operational energy).
     - **Interpretation:** The machine is in an idle state or undergoing initial start-up procedures with minimal energy consumption and no active operations.

2. **Events #4-6 (8:00:15 - 8:00:25): Cutting Metal**
   - **Label:** **Cutting Metal**
   - **Rationale:**
     - **Temperature:** Increases sharply from 50°C to 58°C.
     - **Pressure:** Increases to 1.5 bar.
     - **Vibration Level:** Rises significantly from 30 Hz to 38 Hz.
     - **Material Flow:** Steady at 5 units/s.
     - **Tool Position:** Advances from 5 mm to 10 mm.
     - **Energy Consumption:** Increases from 2.00 kWh to 3.00 kWh.
     - **Interpretation:** The high temperature and vibration levels indicate friction and mechanical movement consistent with cutting operations. The increase in material flow suggests removal of cut material. Increased energy consumption aligns with the power required for cutting metal.

3. **Events #7-8 (8:00:30 - 8:00:35): Assembling Parts**
   - **Label:** **Assembling Parts**
   - **Rationale:**
     - **Temperature:** Stabilizes at 40°C.
     - **Pressure:** Peaks at 2 bar.

     - **Material Flow:** Reduces to 2 units/s.
     - **Tool Position:** Holds steady at 15 mm.
     - **Energy Consumption:** Steady at 2.00 kWh.
     - **Interpretation:** The moderate temperature and pressure suggest mechanical assembly operations. Lower vibration levels indicate less aggressive mechanical activity compared to cutting. The consistent tool position and moderate material flow align with parts being assembled together.

4. **Event #9 (8:00:40): Welding**
   - **Label:** **Welding**
   - **Rationale:**
     - **Temperature:** Spikes to 80°C.

     - **Material Flow:** Drops to 0 units/s.
     - **Tool Position:** Remains at 15 mm.
     - **Energy Consumption:** Jumps to 5.00 kWh.
     - **Interpretation:** The significant increase in temperature and energy consumption indicates a process involving intense heat, characteristic of welding. The high vibration level may result from welding equipment operation. The lack of material flow suggests the process is focused on fusing existing parts rather than adding new materials.

5. **Event #10 (8:00:45): Cool-Down Phase**
   - **Label:** **Cool-Down/Transition**
   - **Rationale:**
     - **Temperature:** Decreases to 30°C.

     - **Tool Position:** Stays at 15 mm.
     - **Energy Consumption:** Decreases to 1.00 kWh.
     - **Interpretation:** The reduction in temperature and energy consumption suggests a cool-down period after welding. The machine is transitioning between activities, preparing for the next operation.

6. **Events #11-12 (8:00:50 - 8:00:55): Quality Inspection**
   - **Label:** **Quality Inspection**

     - **Tool Position:** Advances to 20 mm.
     - **Energy Consumption:** Moderate at around 1.5 kWh.
     - **Interpretation:** The low and stable readings across sensors suggest minimal mechanical activity. The slight increase in tool position and vibration may correspond to scanning or probing parts for inspection. Moderate energy consumption aligns with the power needed for inspection equipment.

7. **Events #13-15 (8:01:00 - 8:01:10): Machine Idle/Shutdown**
   - **Label:** **Idle/Shutdown**
   - **Rationale:**

     - **Pressure:** Consistently at 1 bar.
     - **Vibration Level:** Drops back to 0 Hz.
     - **Material Flow:** Zero units/s.
     - **Tool Position:** Resets to 0 mm.
     - **Energy Consumption:** Decreases to baseline levels around 0.40-0.50 kWh.
     - **Interpretation:** The machine returns to an idle state, indicating the end of the manufacturing process or preparation for the next production cycle.

**Summary of Activities:**

- **Idle/Start-Up (Events #1-3):** Machine is in a ready state with no active operations.
- **Cutting Metal (Events #4-6):** High-temperature and high-vibration activity involving material removal.
- **Assembling Parts (Events #7-8):** Moderate mechanical activity with increased pressure as parts are joined.
- **Welding (Event #9):** High-energy process with extreme temperatures to fuse parts together.
- **Cool-Down/Transition (Event #10):** Machine transitions between activities, reducing operational parameters.
- **Quality Inspection (Events #11-12):** Low-impact activity checking the integrity of assembled and welded parts.
- **Idle/Shutdown (Events #13-15):** Machine powers down, ending the production sequence.

**Conclusion:**

By analyzing the patterns in sensor readings, we inferred the manufacturing activities as follows:

- **Cutting Metal** is characterized by increased temperature, vibration, material flow, and tool movement.
- **Assembling Parts** involves higher pressure with steady tool positioning but lower vibration and material flow.
- **Welding** is identified by a sharp spike in temperature and energy consumption with high vibration.
- **Quality Inspection** shows minimal changes in sensor readings with slight tool movement and low energy usage.
- **Idle States** are marked by baseline readings across all sensors, indicating no active processes.

This step-by-step analysis demonstrates how raw numerical data from machine sensors can be translated into meaningful manufacturing activities through process mining techniques.
