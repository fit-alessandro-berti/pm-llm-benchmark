1. **Documentation Verification:**  
   - Can you walk me through how you determine whether the landlord’s documents are complete and compliant, and what steps are taken if any documents are missing or outdated?

2. **Roles and Responsibilities:**  
   - How does the property coordinator prioritize and manage the different types of documentation and information received from landlords?
   - Could you elaborate on the specific responsibilities of the property manager versus those of the property coordinator throughout the onboarding process?

3. **Decision Criteria for Assigning Property Manager:**  
   - What factors most heavily influence the assignment of a property manager, and how do you balance criteria such as workload, geographic specialization, and past experience with unique property requirements?

4. **Initial Meeting and Communication:**  
   - How does the introductory call or meeting between the property manager and the landlord shape the subsequent steps in the process, particularly regarding special conditions or policies?
   - What are the key topics or decision points typically discussed during that meeting?

5. **Coordination with External Stakeholders:**  
   - How do you coordinate scheduling and communication with external parties like the photographer and the certified inspector, and what is the typical timeline for these activities?
   - In cases where the inspector identifies issues, how do you manage and track the process of resolving them with the landlord?

6. **Marketing and Pricing Strategy:**  
   - How does the digital marketing team integrate inspection outcomes and market trends into the pricing models and marketing materials for a new property?
   - Can you describe the feedback loop between market data, internal pricing strategy, and the final listing details?

7. **Activation and Integration:**  
   - At what point in the process is a property considered “activated” in the rental portal, and how do you ensure that all system integrations (database, listing platforms, etc.) are accurate and up-to-date?

8. **Tenant Screening and Lease Negotiation:**  
   - How do you determine which tenant application criteria are most critical during the screening process, and what methods are used to prioritize applicants when multiple candidates are interested?
   - Could you describe the approach to negotiating lease terms, especially in situations where there might be competitive interest or special tenant requests?

9. **Quality Checks and Compliance:**  
   - What specific elements does the compliance officer focus on during the internal audit, and how do these checks interact with the roles of the financial analyst and the IT department?
   - How is the overall quality and integrity of the onboarding process monitored over time, and who is responsible for implementing improvements based on audit findings?

10. **Handling Exceptions and Custom Cases:**  
    - When exceptions occur (such as properties needing special insurance or landlords requesting custom lease clauses), what processes are in place to handle these deviations from the standard workflow?
    - How do you decide whether to adapt the existing process or create a custom approach for these unique cases?

11. **Process Feedback and Continuous Improvement:**  
    - How is feedback collected from both internal teams and external stakeholders (like landlords and tenants) to refine and improve the onboarding process over time?
    - Can you share any examples of past challenges that led to process changes or updates?

These questions should help clarify each phase of the onboarding process, highlight decision-making criteria, and reveal how exceptions and feedback are managed within your property management system.
