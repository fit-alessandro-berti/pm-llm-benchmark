**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**  
*Consolidated from Interview Transcripts*  

---

### **1. Activities/Tasks**  
1. **Receive Invoice** (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)  
   - Input: Invoice (email)  
   - Output: Invoice logged in system (if valid PO) or returned to supplier (if no PO).  

2. **Log Invoice in System** (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)  
   - Input: Invoice with valid PO.  
   - Output: Invoice record in accounting system.  

3. **Confirm Goods/Services Received** (Role: Purchasing Officer)  
   - Input: Invoice and PO details.  
   - Output: Confirmation email or discrepancy notice.  

4. **Match Invoice to PO** (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)  
   - Input: Confirmed invoice and PO.  
   - Output: Matched invoice or discrepancy flag.  

5. **Approve Invoice** (Role: Department Manager)  
   - Input: Matched invoice, PO, and confirmation.  
   - Output: Approved invoice or rejection notice.  

6. **Schedule Payment** (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)  
   - Input: Approved invoice.  
   - Output: Payment scheduled in system.  

7. **Resolve Discrepancies** (Roles: Purchasing Officer, Supplier Relationship Manager, Accounts Payable Supervisor)

   - Output: Retrospective PO, corrected invoice, or rejection.

### **2. Sequence Flow**  
1. **Start**  **Receive Invoice**  **Check for PO?** (Gateway).  
   - **No PO**: Return invoice to supplier.  
   - **PO Exists**: Proceed to **Log Invoice in System**.  

2. **Log Invoice**  **Forward to Purchasing** (Purchasing Officer)  **Confirm Goods/Services Received**.  
   - **Discrepancy Found?** (Gateway):  
     - **Yes**: Contact supplier or hold invoice (loop back after resolution).  
     - **No**: Send confirmation to Accounts Payable.  

3. **Match Invoice to PO** (Accounts Payable Clerk)  **Match Successful?** (Gateway):  
   - **Yes**: Send to **Approve Invoice** (Department Manager).  
   - **No**: Escalate to **Resolve Discrepancies**.  

4. **Approve Invoice**  **Approved?** (Gateway):  
   - **Yes**: Proceed to **Schedule Payment**.  
   - **No**: Investigate further or reject.  

5. **Schedule Payment**  **End**.

### **3. Gateways/Decision Points**  
- **G1: PO Check** (Exclusive Gateway):  
  - Condition: Does the invoice have a valid PO?  
  - Paths: Return to supplier (no PO) or log invoice (PO exists).  

- **G2: Purchasing Confirmation** (Exclusive Gateway):  
  - Condition: Do invoice details match the PO?  
  - Paths: Resolve discrepancies (no) or proceed to matching (yes).  

- **G3: Invoice Matching** (Exclusive Gateway):  
  - Condition: Do invoice line items match the PO?  
  - Paths: Escalate discrepancies (no) or seek manager approval (yes).  

- **G4: Manager Approval** (Exclusive Gateway):  
  - Condition: Is the invoice approved by the manager?  
  - Paths: Schedule payment (yes) or investigate/reject (no).

### **4. Roles/Participants**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk** (Mary): Logs invoices, matches to PO, escalates issues, schedules payments.  
- **Purchasing Officer** (Dan): Confirms receipt of goods/services, resolves discrepancies with suppliers.  
- **Department Manager** (Carlos): Approves invoices or triggers investigations.  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor** (Rita): Handles exceptions (missing POs, unresolved discrepancies).  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Karen): Assists in resolving supplier-side issues.  

---

### **5. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**  
- **Inputs**: Invoice (email), Purchase Order (PO), supplier contracts.  
- **Outputs**: Confirmation emails, corrected invoices, payment schedule, rejection notices.  
- **Data Objects**: Invoice record (system), retrospective PO, discrepancy log.  

---

### **6. Exceptions/Variations**  
1. **Missing PO**:  
   - Invoice returned to supplier. In some cases, Rita coordinates retrospective PO creation.  

2. **Discrepancies in Pricing/Quantities**:  
   - Loop: Purchasing Officer or Supplier Relationship Manager contacts supplier  invoice revised  recheck by Purchasing.  

3. **Unresolved Discrepancies**:  
   - Escalated to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), who coordinates resolution or rejection.  

4. **Manager Rejection**:  
   - Invoice sent back to Accounts Payable for investigation (rare, per Carlos).  

---

### **7. Ambiguities/Notes**  
- **Retrospective POs**: Rita mentions creating POs for informal services, but the exact criteria/process are unclear.  
- **Supplier Contact**: Karen’s involvement is implied but not systematically documented (e.g., "sometimes" looped in).  
- **Payment Timing**: Interviews do not specify rules for payment scheduling (e.g., weekly batches vs. ad hoc).

**Final Output**: A structured process model that aligns all roles and decision points, with clear gateways and exception-handling loops. A BPMN diagram can be directly mapped from this text, using the above activities, gateways, and swimlanes for roles.
