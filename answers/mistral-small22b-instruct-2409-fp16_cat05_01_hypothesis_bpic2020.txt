 Sure, here are 20 relevant questions that can help analyze and understand the declaration process along with their respective confidence scores:

1. **How many times were declarations submitted by employees?** (Confidence Score: 10/10)
    - This is directly evident from the data provided multiple times.

2. **What was the total frequency of declarations that led to payments being handled?** (Confidence Score: 9/10)
    - Each case where 'Payment Handled' appears can be counted.

3. **What were the most common reasons for rejection by the administration?** (Confidence Score: 8/10)
    - Analyzing occurrences of "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION".

4. **How many declarations were rejected by supervisors after being approved by administrators?** (Confidence Score: 7/10)
    - Tracking sequences where 'APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' is followed by 'REJECTED by SUPERVISOR'.

5. **What was the average performance score of handled payments?** (Confidence Score: 9/10)
    - Calculating the mean value from all instances with 'Payment Handled'.

6. **How many declarations were rejected by employees and then resubmitted?** (Confidence Score: 8/10)
    - Identifying cases where "REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" leads to "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

7. **What was the frequency of rejections by pre-approvers before final approval?** (Confidence Score: 6/10)
    - Finding cases with "REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER" leading to resubmission and eventually 'FINAL_APPROVED'.

8. **How many declarations were directly approved by both the administration and supervisor without rejection?** (Confidence Score: 6/10)
    - Identifying sequences where 'SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' leads to 'APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' and then 'FINAL_APPROVED'.

9. **What was the lowest performance score for any handled payment?** (Confidence Score: 7/10)
    - Extracting the minimum performance value from all 'Payment Handled' instances.

10. **How many iterations of rejection and resubmission occurred before final approval?** (Confidence Score: 8/10)
    - Counting the number of times a declaration was rejected before reaching 'FINAL_APPROVED'.

11. **What was the most common path for declarations that led to payment handling?** (Confidence Score: 9/10)
    - Analyzing the sequence patterns in cases where 'Payment Handled' occurred.

12. **How many declarations were rejected by the budget owner after administration approval?** (Confidence Score: 7/10)
    - Tracking instances where 'APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' is followed by 'REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER'.

13. **What was the frequency of declarations that were never resubmitted after rejection?** (Confidence Score: 6/10)
    - Identifying dead-end sequences where no further action occurred post-rejection.

14. **How many distinct roles (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR) were involved in the rejection and approval process?** (Confidence Score: 9/10)
    - Listing all unique roles mentioned in the data.

15. **What was the total performance value of declarations that did not lead to payment handling?** (Confidence Score: 7/10)
    - Summing up 'performance' values from sequences without 'Payment Handled'.

16. **How many times was a declaration submitted after being rejected by multiple roles?** (Confidence Score: 8/10)
    - Counting instances where a declaration was resubmitted despite rejections from different roles.

17. **What was the average number of days between submission and final approval for handled payments?** (Confidence Score: 6/10)
    - Assuming dates are available, calculate the mean duration from 'SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' to 'FINAL_APPROVED'.

18. **How many declarations were rejected after initial approval by both administration and supervisor?** (Confidence Score: 7/10)
    - Identifying sequences where 'FINAL_APPROVED' is followed by another rejection or resubmission.

19. **What was the highest performance score for any handled payment?** (Confidence Score: 7/10)
    - Extracting the maximum performance value from all 'Payment Handled' instances.

20. **How many different sequences led to the final approval of a declaration?** (Confidence Score: 8/10)
    - Counting and categorizing unique paths from initial submission to 'FINAL_APPROVED'.
