### **Analysis of Insurance Claims Processing Performance Issues**

#### **1. Identifying Cases with Long Durations**
First, let's calculate the total duration for each case by comparing the first (`Submit Claim`) and last (`Close Claim`) timestamps:

| **Case ID** | **Start Time**       | **End Time**         | **Total Duration** | **Complexity** |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 2001        | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | **1h 30m**         | Low            |
| 2002        | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | **25h 55m**        | Medium         |
| 2003        | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | **48h 20m**        | High           |
| 2004        | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | **1h 25m**         | Low            |
| 2005        | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | **73h 5m**         | High           |

**Observations:**
- **Cases 2003 and 2005** take significantly longer (48h+ and 73h+ respectively) compared to low-complexity cases (1h-2h).
- **Case 2002** (Medium complexity) also takes much longer (~26h) than low-complexity cases.

#### **2. Root Cause Analysis by Attributes**
We now analyze how **Resource, Region, and Complexity** correlate with delays.

##### **A. Complexity Impact**
- **High-complexity claims (2003, 2005)** take the longest, with multiple `Request Additional Documents` steps.
  - **Case 2003**: 2 requests (11:00 and 17:00 on Day 1)  Approval on Day 2.
  - **Case 2005**: 3 requests (11:30 on Day 1, 17:00 on Day 2, 15:00 on Day 3)  Approval on Day 4.
- **Medium-complexity (2002)** has 1 request  Approval on Day 2.
- **Low-complexity (2001, 2004)** have no requests  Approval within 1h.

**Conclusion:** Higher complexity leads to more document requests, causing delays.

##### **B. Resource Impact**
- **Adjuster_Mike (Region A)** handles **Case 2003** (High complexity, 2 requests).
- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B)** handles **Cases 2002 (Medium, 1 request) and 2005 (High, 3 requests)**.
  - **Case 2005** has the most delays, possibly due to **Adjuster_Lisa’s workload** or inefficiency.
- **Manager_Ann vs. Manager_Bill**:
  - **Manager_Ann** approves **Cases 2001, 2002, 2004** (faster approvals).
  - **Manager_Bill** approves **Cases 2003, 2005** (slower, possibly due to backlog).

**Conclusion:**
- **Adjuster_Lisa** may be a bottleneck (handling multiple complex cases).
- **Manager_Bill** may have slower approval times.

##### **C. Region Impact**
- **Region A (Cases 2001, 2003)**:
  - **2001 (Low)**: Fast (~1.5h).
  - **2003 (High)**: Slow (~48h).
- **Region B (Cases 2002, 2004, 2005)**:
  - **2004 (Low)**: Fast (~1.5h).
  - **2002 (Medium)**: Slow (~26h).
  - **2005 (High)**: Very slow (~73h).

**Conclusion:**
- **Region B** has more delays, possibly due to **Adjuster_Lisa’s workload** or **Manager_Bill’s slower approvals**.

#### **3. Proposed Explanations & Mitigation Strategies**
| **Root Cause** | **Explanation** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **High Complexity** | More document requests  longer processing. | - Automate document requests where possible. <br> - Set SLAs for document submission. |
| **Adjuster_Lisa’s Workload** | Handles multiple complex cases, causing delays. | - Redistribute workload among adjusters. <br> - Hire additional adjusters for Region B. |
| **Manager_Bill’s Slow Approvals** | Takes longer to approve claims. | - Implement automated approval for low-risk cases. <br> - Train managers to prioritize high-complexity cases. |
| **Region B Delays** | Higher average processing time. | - Analyze regional differences (e.g., staffing, training). <br> - Standardize processes across regions. |

### **Final Recommendations**
1. **Prioritize High-Complexity Cases**: Assign dedicated resources to handle them faster.
2. **Optimize Document Requests**: Reduce unnecessary back-and-forth by improving initial claim submissions.
3. **Balance Workload**: Ensure no single adjuster (e.g., Lisa) is overloaded.
4. **Automate Where Possible**: Use AI/ML to pre-approve low-risk claims.
5. **Monitor Regional Performance**: Identify if Region B has systemic issues (e.g., training gaps).

By addressing these root causes, the insurance claims process can become more efficient, reducing delays and improving customer satisfaction.
