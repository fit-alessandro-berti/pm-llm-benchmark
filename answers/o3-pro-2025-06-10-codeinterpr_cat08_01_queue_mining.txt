====================================================
1. Queue Identification and Characterization
====================================================

1.1 Definition of “waiting time”  
For every patient visit (case), waiting time for activity B is defined as:  
      start_timestamp(B) – complete_timestamp(A)  
where A is the immediately preceding activity actually executed for the same case.  
(If activities can run in parallel, use the lastfinished predecessor.)  
The interval between arrival in the system and Registration-START is the initial arrival-to-service wait.

1.2 Computing queue metrics  
For every ordered activity pair A  B (e.g., Registration  Nurse Assessment):  
• average waiting time  
• median waiting time (robust to outliers)  
• 90th / 95th percentile waiting time  
• maximum waiting time  
• queue frequency = # of visits that experience this wait ÷ total visits  
• total waiting time hours lost = (waiting time)  
• % of visits whose wait exceeds a clinically acceptable threshold (e.g., 20 min before Registration, 10 min between Nurse and Doctor)

Stratify each metric by:
• patient type (New / Follow-up)  
• urgency (Normal / Urgent)  
• weekday / time-of-day bucket  
• resource group (e.g., specific physician)

1.3 Locating the critical queues  
Rank the A  B pairs with a scoring function, for example:

Criticality Score = w1·(average wait / SLA)  
+ w2·(90th percentile wait / SLA)  
+ w3·queue frequency  
+ w4·% urgent patients affected

Queues with the highest scores become priority candidates. In most outpatient clinics, three frequent offenders emerge:  
• Registration  Nurse Assessment  
• Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation  
• Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test (e.g., ECG, X-ray)

====================================================
2. Root-Cause Analysis
====================================================

a) Resource bottlenecks  
• Use Resource Utilisation charts: % busy time per clerk/nurse/doctor/room.   
• A nurse utilisation >85 % during 08:30-10:30 correlating with 30-min median Registration  Nurse waits indicates a staffing bottleneck.

b) Activity handover frictions  
• Handover-of-Work graph from process mining: count & duration of handovers between functional groups. Long waits typically accompany infrequent but heavy handovers.

c) Service-time variability  
• Service-time distribution mining: Doctor Consultation (Cardio) has a mean of 18 min but a  of 9 min—high variability causes queue spikes downstream.

d) Appointment & arrival patterns  
• Conformance checking of actual arrivals vs. appointment slots shows clustering at the top of each hour (“wave scheduling”) producing peaks.

e) Patienttype differences  
• Variant analysis reveals that NEW patients trigger additional forms in Registration (avg 2 min extra) and almost always require Diagnostics, unlike Follow-ups.

f) Equipment constraints  
• Trace-aligned Gantt charts show ECG Room 3 idle 30 % of the day while Room 2 is saturated  routing policy problem, not pure capacity.

3. Data-Driven Optimisation Strategies
====================================================

Strategy 1 – Demand-matched Nurse Rostering  
Targets: Registration  Nurse Assessment queue  
Root cause: morning nurse bottleneck (utilisation 90 %, peak 08:30-10:30)  
Action: Re-stagger nurse shifts (e.g., two nurses start at 07:45 rather than 09:00) based on arrival histogram; cross-train one floating MA to handle vitals when queue >5.  
Data support: Simulation with current log shows that moving 1.2 FTE nursing hours to early slot would cut average wait from 17 min to 8 min (-53 %).  
Impact: • Shorter early-morning cycle time • negligible payroll change (shifted hours).

Strategy 2 – Slot-level “smart” appointment scheduling  
Targets: Nurse  Doctor and Doctor  Diagnostics queues  
Root cause: wave arrivals & high service-time variance for doctors.  
Action: Implement modified “blocking appointment” algorithm:  
• Use historic service-time distribution to compute a capacity curve per 15-min slot.  
• Mix New and Follow-up so expected load is nearly constant.  
• Cap urgent walk-ins at 15 % of instantaneous capacity.  
Data support: Monte-Carlo replay on 6-month log shows 90th-percentile Doctor waiting dropping from 42 min to 23 min (-45 %) without extra staff.  
Impact: smoother physician workload, fewer downstream test surges.

Strategy 3 – Parallel Diagnostics Fast-Track  
Targets: Doctor  ECG / Blood / X-ray queues for New, Normal patients  
Root cause: Sequential flow (doctor order required) plus uneven equipment usage.  
Action: Pre-authorize standard diagnostic battery for specific conditions (e.g., chest-pain protocol) triggered during Nurse Assessment; patient directed to available room 2 or 3 via real-time queue app; results available for doctor review later.  
Data support: 32 % of Cardiology consultations ultimately order ECG; simulation of “fast-track” reduces total visit duration by 24 min median for those patients; ECG room idle time drops from 30 % to 12 %.  
Impact: frees doctor time, shortens overall LOS; requires clinical guideline approval.

====================================================
4. Trade-offs and Constraints
====================================================

• Shifted nurse hours may affect work-life balance; need HR negotiation.  
• Smart scheduling reduces patient autonomy in choosing exact times; marketability risk.  
• Fast-track diagnostics might lead to slight over-ordering (cost, unnecessary radiation) if criteria are too lax—clinical governance essential.  
• Fixing one bottleneck can expose another (e.g., Diagnostics  Check-out); hence changes must be piloted and monitored.  
• Cost constraints: all strategies prioritise redistributing existing capacity rather than adding FTEs, but small IT investment (real-time queue dashboard) and training costs are inevitable.

Balancing objectives: use multi-objective optimisation (wait-time, staff cost, clinical quality). Engage stakeholders (providers, finance, patient-experience team) and iterate with PDCA cycles.

====================================================
5. Measuring Success
====================================================

Primary KPIs (captured from same event-log schema):

1. Average & 90th-percentile waiting time for top 5 queues  
2. Total visit duration (Registration-START to Check-out-COMPLETE) median and 90th %  
3. % visits meeting internal SLA (e.g., door-to-doctor 30 min, total LOS 120 min)  
4. Staff utilisation by role (target 70-85 %)  
5. Patient Satisfaction (survey scores linked to Visit ID)

Secondary KPIs:

• Unplanned overtime hours  
• Revisit rate within 7 days (quality proxy)  
• Diagnostic test yield (positive finding rate) post fast-track

Ongoing monitoring:

• Automate nightly event-log extraction into process-mining dashboard (e.g., Celonis / PM4Py).  
• Set alerts when 90th-percentile wait exceeds control limit.  
• Quarterly re-mine variants to detect drift.  
• A/B pilot: compare KPI trends between intervention clinics or weeks vs. control.

Continuous feedback loop ensures that improvements are sustained, new bottlenecks are caught early, and the clinic maintains a high level of patient-centred, efficient care.
