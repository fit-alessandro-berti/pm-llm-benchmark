<think>
So I have this problem to solve using DuckDB SQL. Let me try to understand what is being asked here.

We have an event log in a table called event_log with columns case_id, activity, and timestamp. Each row represents an event in a process instance, identified by case_id. The timestamp tells us when each activity happened.

First, I need to determine the sequence of activities for each case_id, ordered by the timestamp. So for each case, I want to get the list of activities in the order they occurred.

Then, I need to group the cases by their complete activity sequence. That means cases that have the exact same sequence of activities will be grouped together. Each unique sequence is called a process variant.

Next, I have to count how many cases correspond to each variant and find the top K variants based on their frequency, meaning the number of cases that follow that variant.

Finally, I need to return all the events from the original event log that belong only to the cases that are part of these top K variants. So, any case that doesn't match one of the top K variants should be excluded.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

Step 1: Construct the sequence of activities for each case_id, ordered by timestamp.

To do this, I need to collect the activities for each case in the order of their timestamps. In SQL, I can use the STRING_AGG function to concatenate the activities into a single string, ordered by the timestamp.

Wait, but in DuckDB, is it STRING_AGG or something else? Actually, in DuckDB, it's string_agg. So, I can use string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) to get the sequence of activities as a comma-separated string for each case.

But, I should think about whether using a comma is safe. What if the activity names contain commas? Maybe I should use a different separator that is unlikely to appear in activity names, like ' -> ' or something. Actually, since it's just for grouping, as long as I'm consistent, it should be fine. But to be safe, I'll use ' -> ' as the separator.

So, for each case_id, I can do:

sql
Wrap
Copy
SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id
This will give me a table with each case_id and its corresponding variant (the sequence of activities).

Wait, but actually, in the final step, I need to return the events, so I might need to keep more information. But for now, this seems okay.

Step 2: Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants.

Now, from the above, I have the variant for each case. To find unique variants and count how many cases correspond to each, I can group by the variant and count the number of case_ids.

So, something like:

sql
Wrap
Copy
SELECT variant, COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
FROM (
    SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) AS case_variants
GROUP BY variant
This will give me each unique variant and how many cases have that variant.

Step 3: Determine the top K variants by their frequency.

Now, I need to select the top K variants based on the frequency. In SQL, I can order by frequency descending and limit to K.

But, since I need to filter the original events based on these top K variants, I probably need to get the list of case_ids that belong to these top K variants.

Wait, actually, in the final step, I need to return the events from the cases that are part of the top K variants. So, perhaps I should first identify which case_ids are in the top K variants.

To do that, I can find the variants with the highest frequencies.

One way is to use a window function to rank the variants by frequency and then select the case_ids where the variant's rank is <= K.

Alternatively, I can find the top K variants first and then find the case_ids that have those variants.

Let me think about which one is more efficient.

In DuckDB, I can use QUALIFY clause with window functions, but I'm not sure if it's supported. Wait, actually, DuckDB supports window functions, but I'm not sure about QUALIFY. Maybe I can use a subquery.

Alternatively, I can first find the top K variants and then join back to find the case_ids.

Let me try to outline the steps.

First, get the variants and their frequencies:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
)
Then, to get the top K variants, I can do:

sql
Wrap
Copy
SELECT variant
FROM variant_frequencies
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT K
But wait, if K is 3, and there are multiple variants with the same frequency, this might not be correct. Actually, since it's top K by frequency, if there are ties, it might include more than K variants, but typically, LIMIT K will just take the first K rows after ordering.

But in process mining, usually, we take the top K distinct frequencies, but in this problem, it says "the top K variants by their frequency", so I think it's acceptable to just take the first K after ordering.

Alternatively, to handle ties properly, I could use RANK() or DENSE_RANK() window functions.

For example:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, frequency,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_frequencies
)
SELECT variant
FROM ranked_variants
WHERE rank <= K
This way, if there are ties, all variants with the same frequency will be included if they are within the top K ranks.

Wait, actually, for this problem, since K is given, and we need exactly the top K variants, but in case of ties, it's ambiguous. The problem says "the top K variants by their frequency", so probably, it's fine to just take the first K after ordering by frequency descending.

But to be precise, perhaps I should use the DENSE_RANK() approach to ensure that we include all variants that have the same frequency as the Kth variant.

Wait, actually, in standard SQL, to get the top K with ties, we can use RANK() or DENSE_RANK().

For example, using RANK() <= K would include all variants that have the same frequency as the Kth variant.

Wait, actually, RANK() would assign the same rank to ties, and then skip ranks, while DENSE_RANK() doesn't skip.

But in this context, since we want the top K distinct frequencies, perhaps DENSE_RANK() is more appropriate.

Wait, actually, for top K, usually, we use RANK() to include all ties for the Kth position.

Wait, let's say K=3, and the frequencies are 10, 9, 8, 8, 7, etc. Then, the top 3 variants would be those with frequencies 10, 9, and 8, including both variants with frequency 8.

So, using RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) <= 3 would include all variants with frequency >= the frequency of the 3rd variant.

Wait, in this example, the ranks would be 1 for 10, 2 for 9, 3 for 8, 3 for 8, 5 for 7, etc.

So, RANK() <= 3 would include variants with frequencies 10, 9, and 8.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can find the minimum frequency of the top K variants and then select all variants with frequency >= that minimum.

But using RANK() is straightforward.

So, I'll proceed with that.

Step 4: Return all events from the original event log that belong to cases in the top K variants.

Once I have the top K variants, I need to find the case_ids that have those variants, and then select all events from those case_ids.

So, from the above, I can get the list of top K variants, then join back to the case_variants to get the case_ids, and then join to the original event_log to get the events.

Alternatively, I can do it in one go.

Let me try to write the complete query.

First, let's define K. Wait, in the problem, K is a parameter, so I'll assume it's given.

For the sake of the query, I'll use a variable, but since it's SQL, I might need to hardcode it or use a parameter.

In DuckDB, I can use a parameter, but for simplicity, I'll assume K is known, say K=5, but I'll write it generically.

Wait, actually, since it's a prompt, I should write the query with K as a parameter.

But in SQL, parameters are usually handled differently, but for this exercise, I can use a placeholder.

Alternatively, I can assume K is a number, say 10, and write the query accordingly.

But to make it general, I'll use a subquery or a CTE to define K.

Wait, actually, in the final query, I can use a limit clause with a variable, but in standard SQL, limit accepts a number, not a variable, but in DuckDB, I think it supports variables.

Alternatively, I can use a window function approach.

Wait, since I'm using RANK(), I can do it without specifying K in the limit.

Wait, in the ranked_variants, I can select where rank <= K.

So, let's proceed.

Let me outline the complete query.

First, compute the case_variants:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
Then, compute the variant_frequencies:

sql
Wrap
Copy
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
Then, rank the variants:

sql
Wrap
Copy
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, frequency,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_frequencies
),
Then, select the top K variants:

sql
Wrap
Copy
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rank <= K
),
Wait, but K is a parameter. In SQL, I need to define K somehow. For now, I'll assume K is a number, say 5.

Alternatively, I can use a subquery to get K, but since it's a constant, I'll hardcode it as 5 for this example.

So,

sql
Wrap
Copy
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rank <= 5
),
Then, find the case_ids that have these top variants:

sql
Wrap
Copy
top_cases AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN top_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant
),
Finally, select all events from the original event_log where case_id is in top_cases:

sql
Wrap
Copy
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN top_cases tc ON el.case_id = tc.case_id
Wait, that should work.

But actually, I can optimize this a bit.

Alternatively, I can do it without the intermediate top_variants and top_cases.

For example, I can directly filter the case_ids based on the rank of their variant.

Wait, let's see.

In fact, I can add the rank to the case_variants.

Wait, perhaps like this:

First, compute the variant for each case, then compute the frequency of each variant, then join back to assign the frequency and rank to each case.

Then, select the cases where the rank <= K, and finally select the events from those cases.

Yes, that might be more efficient.

Let me try to write it.

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
case_with_frequency AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id, cv.variant, vf.frequency
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN variant_frequencies vf ON cv.variant = vf.variant
),
case_with_rank AS (
    SELECT case_id, variant, frequency,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_with_frequency
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_with_rank
    WHERE rank <= 5
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN top_cases tc ON el.case_id = tc.case_id
Wait, actually, in this query, I'm computing the rank over the cases, but since multiple cases have the same variant, the rank should be the same for all cases with the same variant.

Wait, actually, in the case_with_rank, the RANK() is over the frequency, but since frequency is the same for all cases with the same variant, the rank will be the same for those cases.

So, yes, this should work.

Alternatively, I can compute the rank in the variant_frequencies and then join.

Wait, in my first approach, I had ranked_variants, then top_variants, then joined to case_variants to get top_cases.

Both should work, but perhaps the first one is slightly more efficient since it avoids carrying the case_id through the ranking.

But in terms of SQL, both are fine.

Actually, another way is to use a subquery to filter the variants.

For example, I can select the case_ids where the variant is in the top K variants.

Like:

sql
Wrap
Copy
SELECT case_id
FROM case_variants
WHERE variant IN (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_frequencies
    ORDER BY frequency DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
But wait, this would select the top 5 variants strictly, without considering ties.

If there are ties, it might not include all variants with the same frequency as the 5th.

So, to handle ties properly, it's better to use the RANK() approach.

Alternatively, I can find the minimum frequency of the top 5 variants and then select all variants with frequency >= that minimum.

For example:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, frequency
    FROM variant_frequencies
    ORDER BY frequency DESC
    LIMIT 5
),
min_freq AS (
    SELECT MIN(frequency) AS min_freq
    FROM top_variants
)
SELECT cv.case_id
FROM case_variants cv
JOIN variant_frequencies vf ON cv.variant = vf.variant
WHERE vf.frequency >= (SELECT min_freq FROM min_freq)
Then, select the events from these case_ids.

This way, I include all variants that have frequency >= the frequency of the 5th variant.

Yes, this is another way to handle ties.

In fact, this is similar to using RANK().

So, either way is fine.

I think using RANK() is more straightforward in this case.

Now, to make the query complete, I need to parameterize K.

In DuckDB, I can use a parameter, but since this is a prompt, I'll assume K is given, and in the query, I'll use a placeholder like $K.

So, in the final query, I'll write WHERE rank <= $K.

Similarly, in the other approach, LIMIT $K.

But since the problem is to write the query, and K is a parameter, I'll use $K in the query.

Wait, actually, in the prompt, it says "top K variants", so I should include $K in the query.

Alternatively, since it's a SQL query, and in many SQL dialects, parameters are used, I'll use $K.

So, let's write the complete query.

I'll use the RANK() approach.

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, frequency,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_frequencies
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN ranked_variants rv ON cv.variant = rv.variant
    WHERE rv.rank <= $K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN top_cases tc ON el.case_id = tc.case_id
This should work.

Wait, but in the top_cases, I can directly select the case_ids where the variant's rank <= $K.

Alternatively, to make it more efficient, perhaps I can avoid joining and use a subquery.

But in terms of performance, DuckDB will optimize it anyway.

Another way is to use a window function directly in the case_variants, but since the ranking is on the variants, not on the cases, it's similar.

I think this is fine.

Alternatively, I can compute the rank in the variant_frequencies and then filter.

Wait, actually, in the above query, I can simplify a bit.

For example, I can select the variants where rank <= $K, then join to case_variants to get the case_ids, then join to event_log.

Yes, that's what I have.

Alternatively, I can use a semi-join or EXISTS, but in SQL, JOIN is fine.

So, I think this query should solve the problem.

Let me check if there are any edge cases.

For example, if K is larger than the number of unique variants, it should just return all events, since all variants would be included.

Yes, since rank <= $K, if $K is larger than the number of variants, it will include all.

Also, if there are cases with only one event, or empty cases, but assuming the event log has at least one event per case, as it's a process instance.

Also, the timestamp ordering should be correct, assuming timestamps are unique per case, but even if there are ties in timestamps, the ORDER BY timestamp should still impose an order, though it might not be deterministic if timestamps are equal, but in process mining, usually, events are ordered by timestamp, and if timestamps are equal, the order might be arbitrary, but that's acceptable.

Alternatively, to make it deterministic, I could order by timestamp and then by some other column, like an event_id, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume ordering by timestamp is sufficient.

Also, in the string_agg, I'm using ' -> ' as the separator, which should be fine.

Alternatively, I could use a different aggregation, like array_agg, but since DuckDB supports string_agg, and the problem is to identify variants as sequences, using a string is acceptable.

In fact, in process mining, variants are often represented as sequences of activities, so this is appropriate.

Therefore, I think this query should work.

Wait, one more thing: in the final select, I need to return all events from the original event log that belong to the top K variants' cases.

So, in the query above, I'm selecting el.*, which should include case_id, activity, timestamp, and any other columns if present, but since the problem specifies the table has those three columns, it should be fine.

Also, the problem says "return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants", so yes, that's what the query does.

Moreover, "Cases not matching the top K variants should be excluded from the final result", which is also handled.

So, I believe this is correct.

Let me try to write it in a single query without redundant parts.

Actually, I can combine some CTEs.

For example, I can compute the variant and then directly compute the frequency and rank.

But in terms of readability, having separate CTEs is better.

Alternatively, some SQL dialects allow nested CTEs, but in standard SQL, it's fine.

I think the query is acceptable.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to write a DuckDB SQL query that identifies the top K process variants based on their frequency and returns all events from the original event log that belong to cases associated with these top K variants. Let's break this down step by step and construct the query.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Determine the sequence of activities for each `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`:**
   - We need to group the events by `case_id` and concatenate the activities into an ordered sequence based on their timestamps.
   - This sequence represents the process variant for each case.

2. **Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants:**
   - Once we have the variant for each case, we need to group cases by their variant and count how many cases correspond to each variant.

3. **Determine the top K variants by their frequency:**
   - We need to rank the variants based on their frequency (the number of cases per variant) and select the top K variants.
   - To handle ties in frequency (e.g., multiple variants with the same frequency), we'll use `RANK()` to ensure that all variants tied for the Kth position are included.

4. **Return all events from the original event log for cases in the top K variants:**
   - Identify the `case_id`s that belong to the top K variants.
   - Filter the original `event_log` to include only events from these `case_id`s.

### SQL Query

We'll use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to make the query modular and easier to understand. We'll assume that `K` is a parameter, denoted as `$K` in the query (DuckDB supports parameters, but `$K` can be replaced with an actual number if needed).

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    -- Step 1: Compute the variant (ordered sequence of activities) for each case_id
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    -- Step 2: Compute the frequency of each variant (number of cases per variant)
    SELECT 
        variant, 
        COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Rank the variants by frequency, handling ties with RANK()
    SELECT 
        variant, 
        frequency,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_frequencies
),
top_cases AS (
    -- Step 4: Identify case_ids that belong to the top K variants
    SELECT 
        cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN ranked_variants rv 
        ON cv.variant = rv.variant
    WHERE rv.rank <= $K
)
-- Step 5: Select all events from the original event_log for cases in the top K variants
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN top_cases tc 
    ON el.case_id = tc.case_id
```

### Explanation of Each Step

- **Step 1: `case_variants` CTE**
  - Group the `event_log` by `case_id`.
  - Use `string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp)` to concatenate the activities into a single string, ordered by `timestamp`.
  - The separator `' -> '` is chosen to clearly represent the sequence and is unlikely to appear in activity names. This creates the variant for each case.

- **Step 2: `variant_frequencies` CTE**
  - Group the variants from `case_variants` by `variant`.
  - Count the number of `case_id`s per variant to determine the frequency of each variant.

- **Step 3: `ranked_variants` CTE**
  - Use the `RANK()` window function to assign a rank to each variant based on its frequency, ordered in descending order.
  - `RANK()` handles ties by assigning the same rank to variants with the same frequency and skipping subsequent ranks (e.g., if two variants tie for rank 1, the next rank is 3).
  - This ensures that if multiple variants tie for the Kth position, all are included.

- **Step 4: `top_cases` CTE**
  - Join `case_variants` with `ranked_variants` on the `variant` column.
  - Filter to include only variants where `rank <= $K`, which selects the top K variants (including ties).
  - Extract the `case_id`s that belong to these top K variants.

- **Step 5: Final Query**
  - Join the original `event_log` with `top_cases` on `case_id`.
  - Select all columns (`el.*`) from `event_log` for events where the `case_id` is in `top_cases`.
  - This returns all events from cases that belong to the top K variants, excluding all other cases.

### Handling Edge Cases

- **Ties in Frequency:**
  - Using `RANK()` ensures that if multiple variants have the same frequency as the Kth variant, all are included in the result.
  - For example, if `K = 3` and the frequencies are 10, 9, 8, 8, 7, ..., the variants with frequencies 10, 9, and 8 (including both variants with frequency 8) will be included.

- **Value of `$K`:**
  - If `$K` is larger than the number of unique variants, all variants will be included (since `rank <= $K` will cover all ranks).
  - If `$K = 0`, no variants will be selected, and the result will be empty.

- **Timestamp Ordering:**
  - The `ORDER BY timestamp` in `string_agg` ensures that activities are ordered correctly within each case.
  - If timestamps are tied for a given `case_id`, the order of activities with the same timestamp may be arbitrary, which is acceptable for defining variants in process mining.

- **Activity Names:**
  - The separator `' -> '` is used to avoid conflicts with commas or other characters that might appear in activity names. This ensures that variants are uniquely identifiable.

### Final Notes

- The query returns all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, and any additional columns) from the original `event_log` for the filtered cases.
- Cases that do not belong to the top K variants are excluded from the result, as required.
- The query is modular and readable, with each CTE handling a specific part of the logic.
- The use of `$K` as a parameter makes the query flexible for different values of K. If needed, `$K` can be replaced with a specific number (e.g., `5`).
