### Analysis:

The event log reveals that several activities appear multiple times within cases, but they have different contextual meanings based on when they occur or the details in the "Additional Context" column. To clarify these differing roles, their names should include context-specific details like their purpose, sequence, or the triggering reason. Specifically:

1. **"Verify Documents"** and **"Call Customer"** are recurring activities whose purposes vary depending on when they occur in the workflow. For example:
   - "Verify Documents" can occur initially for identity verification or later for re-verification after corrections.
   - "Call Customer" can be used for obtaining missing information, clarifying discrepancies, or confirming changes.
   
2. Other activities like "Initiate Request," "Submit Additional," "Adjust Account," and "Approve Request" are not repeated in the same case and retain consistent meanings, so they can remain as-is.

### Justification for Naming Choices:

1. **"Verify Documents"**:
   - When occurring at the start of a case, it represents an **initial document verification** process. This is now reflected in the name "Initial Document Verification."
   - When repeated later in the case, it involves checking updated or corrected documents. This is renamed as "Re-verify Updated Documents" or "Re-verify Corrected Documents," depending on the context (e.g., after customer submits additional info or account adjustments are made).

2. **"Call Customer"**:
   - The meaning of this activity changes drastically in different contexts:
     - When used to request missing documents, it is renamed "Call for Missing Documentation."
     - To address an account discrepancy, it is renamed "Clarify Account Discrepancy Call."
     - As a follow-up call to confirm adjustments, it is renamed "Confirm Adjustment Call."
     - In the branch customer context, where the customer stepped out and is called back, it is renamed "Customer Return Call."

3. **"Submit Additional"**:
   - This activity, representing the submission of additional documents by the customer, is renamed "Submit Additional Documentation" to clearly reflect its purpose.

4. All other activities, such as "Initiate Request," "Adjust Account," and "Approve Request," retain their original names since they have consistent meanings and do not recur within the same case.

### Summary of Changes:
- Multi-occurring activity names ("Verify Documents," "Call Customer") were disambiguated with specific labels reflecting their purpose and timing.
- Contextual clues, such as "Additional Context," the role of the resource, and chronological order, guided the choice of new names.
- The revised names now clarify the distinct roles of recurring activities in the workflow.
