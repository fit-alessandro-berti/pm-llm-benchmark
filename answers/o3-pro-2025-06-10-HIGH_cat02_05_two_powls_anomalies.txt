1. Canonical “Hire-to-Retire” order  
   Post job ad  Screen candidates  Conduct interviews  Make hiring decision  
   • if “NO-HIRE”end process  
   • if “HIRE”Onboard employee  Add employee to payroll  Close case  

2. Model-by-model inspection  

  
POWL Model 1 (pure partial order)  

Guaranteed order                               : Post  Screen  
Parallel or unspecified (no edge)              : Interview  Decide  
Remainder of the flow                          : Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  

Anomalies  
A1  (severe)  Hire decision can be taken before (or even during) the interviews because there is no edge Interview  Decide.  
A2  (medium)  Process contains only the “positive” branch; there is no possibility to reject a candidate and close the case early.  
A3  (minor)   Everything after Decide is strictly sequential; this is not wrong but leaves no room for parallel onboarding/payroll activities.  

Overall, except for the missing precedence Interview  Decide, the flow is basically the linear, happy-path Hire-to-Retire sequence.  

  
POWL Model 2 (partial order + LOOP + XOR)  

Guaranteed order                               : Post  Screen  AND  Post  Interview  
                                              : Interview  Decide  Loop(Onboard*)  XOR(Payroll, skip)  Close  
No order between Screen and the rest           : Screen can happen at any moment after Post, even after Close.  

Anomalies  
B1  (severe)  Screening is not required before interviews or before the hiring decision; it may even occur after case closure.  
B2  (severe)  Payroll is placed in an XOR with a silent transition, i.e. adding the employee to payroll is optional.  
B3  (medium)  Onboarding is put in a LOOP with a -branch, allowing the organisation to onboard the same employee an arbitrary number of times.  
B4  (medium)  Screening and interviewing can run in parallel although, in reality, candidates are usually invited to interviews only after a screening pass.  
B5  (medium)  No rejection branch, same as Model 1.  

The combined effect of B1 and B2 violates two core business rules: a) decide only after all assessments are complete, and b) every hired employee must enter payroll exactly once.  

3. Which model is closer to the normative process?  

Model 1 is the better approximation.  
• Its single critical flaw (A1) is a missing precedence edge; adding Interview  Decide would repair it.  
• All post-hiring steps are mandatory and occur in the correct order.  

Model 2, in contrast, breaks fundamental logic (screening may lag behind or be irrelevant, payroll may be skipped, onboarding may repeat indefinitely), leading to incorrect or financially risky executions. Therefore Model 1 is the model that more closely aligns with a standard Hire-to-Retire workflow.
