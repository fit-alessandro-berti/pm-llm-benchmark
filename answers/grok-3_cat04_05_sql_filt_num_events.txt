Here's a refined draft for the benchmark prompt, ensuring clarity, precision, and alignment with the task's intent:

**Benchmark Prompt: Filtering Event Log Cases by Event Count**

**Context:**  
You are working with an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. Each row in the table represents a single event in a process. The table contains at least the following columns:  
- `case_id`: A unique identifier grouping events that belong to the same process instance (or 'case').  
- `activity`: The name or type of the event.  
- `timestamp`: The time at which the event occurred.  

**Task:**  
Write a DuckDB SQL query to filter the `event_log` table such that it returns only the events from cases (i.e., `case_id` groups) that have six or fewer events in total. In other words, exclude any `case_id` that has more than six associated events, and return the complete set of events for the remaining cases (those with six or fewer events).  

**Requirements:**  
- Identify the number of events per `case_id`.  
- Filter out any `case_id` with more than six events.  
- Return all events (with all columns) for the qualifying cases.  
- Ensure the solution is efficient and correctly handles grouping and filtering.  

**Expected Output:**  
The result should be a table containing all rows from `event_log` for cases with six or fewer events, maintaining the original structure of the table (i.e., including columns like `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, and any others present).  

**Note:**  
You can assume the `event_log` table is non-empty and that `case_id` values are non-null. Focus on crafting a clear and correct SQL query using DuckDB syntax.

This version enhances readability, provides explicit context, and sets clear expectations for the task while maintaining the original intent. It also includes a note to address potential edge cases and emphasizes efficiency and correctness. If you have specific test data or additional constraints (e.g., handling ties or specific sorting), they can be added to the prompt.
