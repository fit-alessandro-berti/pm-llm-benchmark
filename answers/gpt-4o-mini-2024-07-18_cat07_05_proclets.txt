The visualization consists of three main components related to a lab process involving two classes of procelet, highlighted in three parts: (a), (b), and (c).

### Part (a): Process Flow
- This part illustrates the flow of activities between the "Lab visit" and "Lab test" processes.
- Key actions include:
  - **Order Entry**: The lab assistant takes a blood sample and enters an order into an order system.
  - **Judge Results**: Results are evaluated, with options to either accept them if everything is fine or repeat tests if necessary.
  - **Receiving Results**: There is a system for receiving and updating results, which implies a feedback loop for accuracy.
  - The involvement of a chemical analyst is crucial for performing tests and making reports.

### Part (b): Class Diagram
- This component depicts the relationships between the two procelet classes.
- The diagram indicates constraints, such as:
  - A "Lab visit" requires at least one and potentially many "Lab tests," establishing a strong association between the two classes.

### Part (c): Example of a Performative
- This section presents a tabulated example detailing a specific interaction:
  - **Time**: Lists the time of interaction.
  - **Channel**: Specifies the communication channel (order system).
  - **Sender**: Indicates who initiated the communication (Lab visit - HGB John).
  - **Receivers**: Identifies the target of the communication (Lab test - HGB John).
  - **Action**: Describes the action taken (Create).
  - **Content**: Details the specific request (“Can you perform a HGB test for John?”).
  - **Scope and Direction**: Indicates that the communication is private and its outward direction.

Overall, the visualization describes a structured lab workflow combining management (order entry) and analysis (lab tests), emphasizing communication and relationship dynamics in a healthcare context.
