The provided visualization consists of a series of diagrams representing interactions and processes related to a lab visit and lab tests.

### (a) Proect Classes
- **Overview**: This part of the diagram illustrates two proect classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test," connected through two communication channels.
- **Components**:
  - **Lab Visit**:
    - *Order Entry*: Initiated by the doctor.
    - *Take Blood Sample*: Conducted by a lab assistant.
    - *Judge Results*: Process involving evaluation of results.
    - *Send Report*: Communicating findings, with evaluation loops if results are unsatisfactory.
  - **Lab Test**:
    - *Perform Test*: Handled by chemical analysts.
    - *Make Report*: Creation of a report based on test results.
    - *Finish Lab Test*: Concludes the lab testing process.

### (b) Class Diagram
- This segment provides a visual representation of the two proect classes and their relationships, indicating that a "Lab visit" requires one or more "Lab tests."

### (c) Example of a Performative
- The table outlines an example situation:
  - **Time**: 11:00
  - **Channel**: Order system
  - **Sender**: Lab visit - HGB John
  - **Receivers**: Lab test - HGB John
  - **Action**: Create
  - **Content**: A request for performing an HGB test.
  - **Scope**: Private
  - **Direction**: OUT

Overall, the visualization emphasizes the workflow and the communication processes involved in laboratory operations, detailing how various actors interact within specified classes and channels.
