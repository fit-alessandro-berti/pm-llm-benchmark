**Explanation:**

The system log data was transformed into a process mining event log by grouping related events into distinct cases and assigning meaningful activity names. Here's how the logic was applied:

1. **Case Identification**: Each distinct sequence of activities without interruption from another case was considered as one case. For example, from opening "Quarterly_Report.docx" to saving it involves continuous editing actions and thus constitutes a single case (Case_001).

2. **Activity Naming**: Raw action types were translated into higher-level activities that describe the user's intent or task performed:
   - `FOCUS` was interpreted as 'Open', indicating the start of interaction with an application or document.
   - `TYPING` was named 'Edit' since it involves adding text content to a document.
   - `SAVE` was straightforwardly labeled 'Save'.
   - `SWITCH` and `CLOSE` were grouped under 'Close Application' and 'Switch to/from Application', respectively, as they denote changes in application focus.
   - `CLICK`, when used within the context of an email or document, was interpreted as 'Check' or 'Interact with Email/Document'.
   - `SCROLL` was labeled as 'Review', assuming it's part of reading through content.
   - `HIGHLIGHT` was named 'Highlight Key Findings' to capture its likely purpose in a report review context.

This transformation aimed to create activities that are more comprehensible for process analysis while preserving the chronological flow and logical structure of the user’s work session. Derived attributes such as timestamps were directly taken from the system log, maintaining their original values.
