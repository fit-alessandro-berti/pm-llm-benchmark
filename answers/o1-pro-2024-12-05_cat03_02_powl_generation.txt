from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Create the basic transitions
SR = Transition(label="SR")       # Verify Service Request
CS = Transition(label="CS")       # Contract Setup
DA = Transition(label="DA")       # Datacenter Allocation
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")     # Access Control Initialization
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")     # Base Network Configuration
D_R = Transition(label="D&R")     # Debug & Reconfigure
CD = Transition(label="CD")       # Containerized Deployment
MD = Transition(label="MD")       # Monolithic Deployment
QA = Transition(label="QA")       # Quality Assurance
SA = Transition(label="SA")       # Security Audit
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")     # Go-Live Approval

# Construct the loop operator for the configuration phase:
# The pattern is LOOP(A, B) meaning: execute A, then either exit or execute B followed by A again.
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Construct the exclusive choice operator for the deployment methods:
# XOR(CD, MD)
xor_deploy = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Now we define the entire process as a strict partial order of nodes.
# The nodes include all transitions and the operator nodes.
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, xor_deploy, QA, SA, GLA])

# Add the ordering constraints according to the description:

# 1. Process starts with SR -> CS
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# 2. After CS, DA and ACI can start in parallel. They both depend on CS:
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# 3. The loop (BNC followed by optional D&R) can only start after DA and ACI are both completed:
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)

# 4. After the loop ends (the network is stable), we have an exclusive choice between CD and MD:
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor_deploy)

# 5. After the deployment is chosen and completed (CD or MD), QA and SA must be done.
# QA and SA are parallel: both depend on xor_deploy, but have no order between them:
root.order.add_edge(xor_deploy, QA)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deploy, SA)

# 6. Finally, after both QA and SA are completed, GLA can be performed:
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# The resulting 'root' is a POWL model of the entire described scenario.
