After analyzing the process variants, I've identified 20 relevant questions that can help understand the process better. I've also assigned a confidence score to each question based on the frequency and performance data. The confidence score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a high-confidence question.

Here are the 20 questions:

1. **What is the most common path for a declaration to be approved and paid?** (Confidence score: 0.9)
	* Looking at the variants, it seems that the most common path is Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled.
2. **Why do declarations often get rejected by the administration?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* Rejection by administration is a common occurrence, but the reasons behind it are unclear.
3. **What is the impact of pre-approval on the overall process performance?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* Variants with pre-approval seem to have a lower frequency, but the performance impact is unclear.
4. **How often do employees resubmit declarations after rejection?** (Confidence score: 0.9)
	* Many variants show employees resubmitting declarations after rejection, indicating a potential issue with the initial submission process.
5. **What is the role of the budget owner in the approval process?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* Budget owners appear in several variants, but their specific role and impact on the process are unclear.
6. **Why do some declarations get rejected by the supervisor?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* Supervisor rejection is a relatively common occurrence, but the reasons behind it are unclear.
7. **How does the performance of the process change when a declaration is approved by the administration but rejected by the supervisor?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
	* This specific scenario has a relatively low frequency, but the performance impact is significant.
8. **What is the relationship between the number of rejections and the overall process performance?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* Variants with multiple rejections tend to have lower frequencies and worse performance, indicating a potential correlation.
9. **Can the process be optimized by reducing the number of approval steps?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* Some variants have fewer approval steps, but the impact on performance is unclear.
10. **How often do employees save declarations without submitting them?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
	* The variant Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE has a relatively low frequency, but it may indicate a potential issue with the submission process.
11. **What is the impact of missing information on the process performance?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* Variants with missing information (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by MISSING) tend to have worse performance, indicating a potential correlation.
12. **Why do some declarations get rejected by the pre-approver?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
	* Pre-approver rejection is a relatively rare occurrence, but the reasons behind it are unclear.
13. **Can the process be improved by providing more feedback to employees during the submission process?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* Employees often resubmit declarations after rejection, indicating a potential need for more feedback.
14. **What is the relationship between the number of approvals and the overall process performance?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* Variants with more approvals tend to have better performance, indicating a potential correlation.
15. **How often do declarations get stuck in the approval process?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
	* Some variants show declarations getting stuck in the approval process, indicating a potential issue with the process flow.
16. **What is the impact of administration rejection on the overall process performance?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* Administration rejection is a common occurrence, and its impact on performance is significant.
17. **Can the process be optimized by introducing more automation?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* Some variants have more manual steps, which may indicate a potential opportunity for automation.
18. **Why do some declarations get rejected by the employee themselves?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
	* Employee self-rejection is a relatively rare occurrence, but the reasons behind it are unclear.
19. **What is the relationship between the process performance and the number of times a declaration is resubmitted?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* Variants with more resubmissions tend to have worse performance, indicating a potential correlation.
20. **Can the process be improved by providing more training to employees on the submission process?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* Employees often resubmit declarations after rejection, indicating a potential need for more training.

Please note that these questions are meant to be starting points for further analysis and discussion. The confidence scores are subjective and based on my interpretation of the data.
