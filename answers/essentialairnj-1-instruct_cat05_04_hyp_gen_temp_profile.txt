**Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Receive (R) to Approve (P):**  
   - Expected average: ~25 hours, STDEV: ? (not specified but low)  
   - **Observation:** Very low standard deviation suggests rigid and inflexible timing, possibly conflicting with business logic.  

2. **Approve (P) to Notify (N):**  
   - Expected average: 7 days, STDEV: 2 days  
   - **Observation:** Unusually long average with high STDEV indicates irregular delays or rapid notifications, possibly indicating backlog or resource issues.  

3. **Assign (A) to Close (C):**  
   - Expected average: 2 hours  
   - **Observation:** Premature closures following an assignment, without consistent Evaluate or Approve steps, raise concerns about bypassing critical process stages.  

4. **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N):**  
   - Expected average: 5 minutes  
   - **Observation:** Too swift a progression suggests potential bypassing of necessary approvals or notifications.  

5. **Approve (P) to Close (C):**  
   - Expected average: 1 hour, STDEV: 50 minutes

**Potential Cause for Anomalies:**

- **System Processing Delays:** Manual entry or approval processes causing irregularities.  
- **Automated Steps Skipping Activities:** Rapid automated closures bypassing checks.  
- **Resource Availability Issues:** Uneven distributing of workload among adjusters or other resources.  
- **Client-Specific Conditions:** Specific customer/client profiles possibly altering process execution.  
- **Regional or Strategic Factors:** Geographic or business rules influencing timing.

**Verification by SQL Queries:**

1. **Identify Claims Where Receive to Approve Is Unusual:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp, ce1.activity AS Activity1, ce2.timestamp, ce2.activity AS Activity2, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_seconds
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   WHERE ce1.claim_id IN (SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events GROUP BY claim_id HAVING MAX(timestamp) >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days')
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 90000
   ORDER BY ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp;
   ```

2. **Check for Claims Closed Immediately Upon Assignment:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS assign_time, ce2.timestamp AS close_time, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS quick_closure_seconds
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   WHERE ce2.timestamp < (ce1.timestamp + INTERVAL '1 hour')
   ORDER BY claim_id, assign_time;
   ```

3. **Verify Long Approve to Notify Delays by Adjuster:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS approve_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time, ce1.resource AS approve_adjuster, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS long_delay_seconds
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800
   ORDER BY long_delay_seconds DESC;
   ```

4. **Anomalies by Customer Type and Region:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_type, ce1.timestamp AS receive_time, ce2.timestamp AS approve_time, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_seconds, c.customer_id
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 90000
   ORDER BY claim_type, receive_time;
   ```

5. **Analyze Adjuster Performance for Extremely Long Closures After Assignment:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT ce1.resource AS adjuster, ce1.timestamp AS assign_time, ce2.timestamp AS close_time, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS avg_closure_seconds
