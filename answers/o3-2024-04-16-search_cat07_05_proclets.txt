The visualization is composed of three related parts that together illustrate how two interacting “proclet” process classes coordinate the blood-test workflow in a healthcare setting.

1. Part (a) – “Two proclet classes connected through two channels”  
   • Proclet class 1, labelled “Lab visit,” appears on the left. Its life-cycle starts at the small solid black circle (initial state) and ends at the encircled black disk (final state).  
   • Activities in the Lab-visit proclet are shown as rounded rectangles (e.g., “Order entry,” “Take blood sample,” “Judge results,” “Do tests again,” “Send report”). Human roles (doctor, lab assistant) are depicted as small icons next to the activities they perform.  
   • Proclet class 2, labelled “Lab test,” appears on the right with its own start and end states. Core activities (“Perform test,” “Make report,” “Provide updated report,” “Finish lab test”) are executed by a chemical analyst (icon shown).  
   • Diamond-shaped gateways show decisions: after “Judge results,” the flow can branch to “Everything fine” (green annotation) or loop back for additional tests (red annotation).  
   • The two proclets exchange messages over two explicit channels, drawn as dashed rounded rectangles with arrowheads:  
     – Channel “Order system” (upper dashed box) initiates a test request (message t3) from the Lab-visit proclet to the Lab-test proclet.  
     – Channel “HIS” (lower dashed box) is used for result transfer (messages t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11).  
     Messages are labelled t1 … t11 to show the causal correspondence between sending and receiving places in the two nets.

2. Part (b) – “Class diagram containing the two proclet classes”  
   A UML-style class box states that every Lab-visit instance (multiplicity 1..1) requires one or more (multiplicity 1..*) associated Lab-test instances. This captures the structural dependency: a patient visit can trigger multiple laboratory tests.

3. Part (c) – “Example of a performative”  
   A tabular record shows one concrete communication event on the Order-system channel at 11:00.  
   • Sender: the Lab-visit proclet for patient John.  
   • Receivers: a specific Lab-test proclet instance (“HGB John”).  
   • Action: “Create” (i.e., instantiate the Lab-test proclet).  
   • Content: natural-language request “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”  
   • Scope: Private. Direction: OUT (from sender to receiver).

In summary, the figure demonstrates how modular proclet nets, combined with explicit message channels and performatives, model a collaborative healthcare scenario where a patient encounter proclet orchestrates one or more laboratory-testing proclets and exchanges orders and results in a well-defined, event-driven manner.
