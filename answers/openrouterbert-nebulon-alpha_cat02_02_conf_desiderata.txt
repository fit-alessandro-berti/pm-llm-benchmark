### **Analysis of the Event Log**

#### **1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Process Behavior)**
The normative rules define a **strict sequence** and **ordering constraints** that must be followed. Violations of these rules are **serious** and indicate non-compliance with the process.

| **Case ID** | **Violation** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **2** | **Multiple violations** | - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**: The process requires `Credit Check  Risk Assessment`, but in Case 2, `Risk Assessment` (08:20) occurs **before** `Credit Check` (09:00). <br> - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**: The loan was rejected (09:30), but `Finalize Documentation` (10:00) was still performed, which is **not allowed**. <br> - **Close Case after invalid Finalize Documentation**: Since `Finalize Documentation` should not occur after a rejection, the `Close Case` (10:30) is also problematic because it follows an invalid step. |
| **All other cases (1, 3)** | **No normative violations** | - Case 1 follows the exact sequence: `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`. <br> - Case 3 follows the correct sequence, though it has **desiderata violations** (discussed below). |

#### **2. Violations of Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**
Desiderata are **best practices** that are **not strictly enforced** but are **preferred** for efficiency and customer satisfaction. Violations here are **not severe** but indicate **suboptimal behavior**.

| **Case ID** | **Desiderata Violation** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **3** | **Credit Check delayed (>24 hours)** | The `Credit Check` (2024-01-14 10:00) occurred **4 days after** `Application Received` (2024-01-12 09:00), exceeding the recommended **24-hour window**. |
| **3** | **Inform Applicant delayed (>48 hours)** | The `Inform Applicant` (2024-01-16 15:00) occurred **2 days and 3 hours after** `Loan Decision` (2024-01-14 12:00), exceeding the recommended **48-hour window**. |
| **3** | **No Follow-up Call** | The process **recommends** (but does not require) a `Follow-up Call` before closing the case. This was **omitted** in Case 3. |
| **1** | **No desiderata violations** | All recommended timing and follow-up steps were followed. |
| **2** | **Not applicable (already has normative violations)** | Since Case 2 **violates strict rules**, its desiderata compliance is irrelevant. |

#### **3. Possible Interpretations & Justifications for Observed Behaviors**
While some deviations are clear violations, others may have **contextual explanations**:

| **Case ID** | **Observed Behavior** | **Possible Justification** |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **2** | **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** | - **Human error**: A process worker may have mistakenly performed the `Risk Assessment` first, assuming the `Credit Check` was already done. <br> - **System glitch**: A workflow automation tool may have incorrectly triggered `Risk Assessment` prematurely. <br> - **Manual override**: A supervisor may have forced an early `Risk Assessment` due to urgency, bypassing the standard sequence. |
| **2** | **Finalize Documentation after Rejection** | - **Miscommunication**: The loan officer may have **misunderstood the decision** (e.g., thought it was "approved with conditions" rather than a full rejection). <br> - **System error**: The loan decision status may have been **incorrectly recorded** in the system, leading to wrong downstream actions. <br> - **Process inefficiency**: The team may be **overly cautious**, finalizing documents "just in case" even after rejection (though this is **not allowed**). |
| **3** | **Delayed Credit Check (>24 hours)** | - **High application volume**: The bank may have been **overwhelmed with applications**, causing delays in processing. <br> - **Manual review required**: The applicant’s case may have needed **additional verification**, delaying the `Credit Check`. <br> - **Weekend/holiday delay**: The application was received on a **Friday**, and the `Credit Check` was done the following **Tuesday** (though this would still be a delay). |
| **3** | **Delayed Inform Applicant (>48 hours)** | - **Internal approval delays**: The loan decision may have required **additional managerial review**, delaying notification. <br> - **Communication backlog**: The team responsible for informing applicants may have been **understaffed**. <br> - **Applicant unavailability**: The bank may have **attempted to contact the applicant earlier** but failed, leading to delays. |
| **3** | **No Follow-up Call** | - **Resource constraints**: The bank may have **limited staff** to make follow-up calls. <br> - **Low-priority case**: The loan may have been **straightforward**, making a follow-up call **unnecessary**. <br> - **Automation preference**: The bank may rely on **automated notifications** (email/SMS) instead of manual calls. |

### **Summary of Findings**
| **Case ID** | **Normative Violations** | **Desiderata Violations** | **Severity** |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **1** | None | None | **Fully compliant** |
| **2** | - Risk Assessment before Credit Check <br> - Finalize Documentation after Rejection | N/A (already non-compliant) | **Critical violations** (process failure) |
| **3** | None | - Credit Check delayed (>24h) <br> - Inform Applicant delayed (>48h) <br> - No Follow-up Call | **Suboptimal but compliant** |

### **Recommendations for Improvement**
1. **For Case 2 (Critical Violations):**
   - **Enforce strict sequence checks** in the workflow system to **prevent `Risk Assessment` before `Credit Check`**.
   - **Automate decision-based branching** to **block `Finalize Documentation` after a rejection**.
   - **Train staff** on the correct process sequence and decision logic.

2. **For Case 3 (Desiderata Violations):**
   - **Set up automated alerts** for delayed `Credit Check` and `Inform Applicant` steps.
   - **Monitor SLA compliance** (e.g., 24h for `Credit Check`, 48h for `Inform Applicant`).
   - **Encourage follow-up calls** by making them a **soft requirement** in the system (e.g., a checkbox to confirm if a call was made).

3. **General Process Improvements:**
   - **Implement process mining** to **detect deviations in real-time**.
   - **Use RPA (Robotic Process Automation)** to **enforce strict sequencing** and **prevent human errors**.
   - **Conduct periodic audits** to ensure compliance with both **normative rules** and **desiderata**.

This analysis helps distinguish between **critical failures** (normative violations) and **efficiency issues** (desiderata violations), allowing for targeted improvements.
