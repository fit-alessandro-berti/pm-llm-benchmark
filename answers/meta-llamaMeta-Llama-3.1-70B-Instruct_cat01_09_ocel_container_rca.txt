Based on the provided directly follows graph, I'll identify some potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

1. **Inefficient Container Loading and Unloading**:
	* The transition "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" has a high frequency (1753) and duration (2318.32). This might indicate that the loading process is time-consuming, leading to delays.
	* Similarly, the transition "Load to Vehicle" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" has a high frequency (1390) and duration (4349.86), suggesting that containers are being moved back and forth between the loading bay and vehicles, causing inefficiencies.
2. **Forklift Bottleneck**:
	* The Forklift object type has a limited number of objects (3), but a high number of events and transitions, indicating a potential bottleneck in the process.
	* The transitions involving Forklift, such as "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" and "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock", have high frequencies and durations, suggesting that the Forklift is a critical resource that might be causing delays.
3. **Truck Loading and Driving Inefficiencies**:
	* The transition "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" has a high frequency (8559) and duration (5259.71), indicating that trucks are being loaded and re-loaded multiple times, leading to inefficiencies.
	* The transition "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" has a high frequency (1988) and duration (84119.09), suggesting that trucks are spending a significant amount of time driving to and from the terminal, which might be causing delays.
4. **Rescheduling and Re-planning**:
	* The transitions involving "Reschedule Container" have high durations (e.g., 7110.06, 177997.60, and 40895.81), indicating that rescheduling and re-planning activities are time-consuming and might be causing delays.
	* The frequency of these transitions is relatively low, but the durations are significant, suggesting that when rescheduling occurs, it has a substantial impact on the process.
5. **Order Empty Containers and Departure Delays**:
	* The transition "Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart" has a high frequency (561) and duration (1007066.16), indicating that there might be delays in ordering empty containers or preparing for departure.
	* The transition "Depart" -> "Depart" has a high frequency (142) and duration (1051301.41), suggesting that departures are being delayed or re-scheduled, leading to inefficiencies.

These are some potential root causes for performance issues in the process. To further investigate and confirm these findings, it would be beneficial to analyze additional data, such as:

* Process metrics (e.g., throughput, lead time, and cycle time)
* Resource utilization (e.g., Forklift and Truck usage)
* Inventory levels and container availability
* Transportation and logistics data (e.g., driving times, distances, and traffic patterns)

By combining these insights with the directly follows graph, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the process and identify targeted improvements to address the performance issues.
