Analyzing the process directly follows graph for each object type, several potential root causes for performance issues in the process can be identified:

1. **Handling Unit**: High frequency of "Load Truck" activity (10553 events, 7820.93 duration) could indicate a bottleneck in the loading process.

2. **Truck**: The high frequency of "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" transition (8559 events, 5259.71 duration) and long duration of "Drive to Terminal" (10999.07) and "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" (84119.09) transitions suggest inefficiencies in the truck loading and driving process.

3. **Container**: The low frequency and long duration of "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" (1814 events, 1960.09 duration) and "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (1794 events, 743380.51 duration) transitions indicate potential bottlenecks in the container weighing and stock placement process.

4. **Vehicle**: The high frequency of "Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" (1827 events, 1960.59 duration) and "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" (585 events, 295965.56 duration) transitions may indicate inefficiencies in the vehicle loading and booking process.

5. **Forklift**: The high frequency of "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" (1753 events, 2318.32 duration) and "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" (1673 events, 1932.67 duration) transitions may indicate over-reliance on forklifts or inefficiencies in the loading bay process.

6. **Customer Order and Transport Document**: The long durations of "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document" (329005.22) and "Create Transport Document" -> "Book Vehicles" (22207.07) transitions may indicate inefficiencies in the order registration and transport document creation process.

Some specific data points that may be contributing to performance issues:

* The long duration of "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (743380.51) suggests a potential delay in moving containers from stock to the loading bay.
* The high frequency of "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" (8559 events) and "Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" (1827 events) transitions may indicate over-reliance on these
