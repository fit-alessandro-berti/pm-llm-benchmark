The picture is a BPMN 2.0 process diagram that explains how a computer-hardware shop prepares a parcel for collection by a carrier.  
Key elements you can see:

1. Pool and lanes  
   • One pool contains three horizontal lanes that represent the parties involved:  
     – Logistics (top lane)  
     – Dispatch of goods / Secretary (middle lane)  
     – Warehouse (bottom lane)

2. Start and end  
   • A blank start event “Ship goods” (left, middle lane) triggers the whole flow.  
   • A blank end event “Shipment prepared” (right, bottom lane) marks completion.

3. Parallel work (parallel gateways – “plus” symbols)  
   • Immediately after the start event the flow is split:  
     – The secretary begins the administrative part of the shipment.  
     – The warehouse begins to physically “Package goods.”  
   • A second parallel gateway near the right-hand side later synchronises the two branches before the final steps.

4. Administrative branch (middle lane)  
   a. Clarify shipment method (task) — fed by an “Order details” data object.  
   b. Exclusive decision “Special handling?”  
      – If YES  obtain three quotations, then “Select logistic company and place order.”  
      – If NO  continue directly.  
   c. Check if insurance is required (task, using “Customer information”).  
      – If insurance is needed, a token rises to the Logistics lane where the parcel is actually “Insure parcel.”  
   d. “Write package label” is executed in every case.  
   e. An inclusive gateway then joins the label/insurance path with the special-handling path.

5. Warehouse branch (bottom lane)  
   • “Package goods” may last long; a non-interrupting timer boundary event (“48 hours”) is attached.  
     – If the work exceeds 48 h, “Notify customer about delay” is performed, after which packaging continues.

6. Completion steps (bottom lane)  
   • When both the administrative and packaging branches are finished, the lower parallel gateway merges them.  
   • “Fill out shipment paperwork.”  
   • “Move package to pickup area.”  
   • End event “Shipment prepared.”

7. Data objects  
   • Order details – input for clarifying shipping.  
   • Customer information – input for deciding on insurance.

8. Gateways and events used  
   • Parallel gateways () – create and join concurrent work.  
   • Exclusive gateway (×) – either / or path for special handling.  
   • Inclusive gateway () – merges flows that may or may not all be present.  
   • Non-interrupting timer boundary event (clock symbol) – raises an escalation without stopping the main task.

Overall, the diagram shows how clerical and warehouse activities are coordinated, how exceptions (long packaging time) are handled, and how decisions about special handling and insurance influence the path before the shipment is finally ready for pickup.
