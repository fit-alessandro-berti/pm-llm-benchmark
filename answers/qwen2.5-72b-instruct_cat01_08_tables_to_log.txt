### Assumptions Made
1. **Item Picked Events**: Each item picking event is treated as a separate activity to capture the detailed process flow.
2. **Order Dispatched and Arrived Events**: Each delivery is treated as a separate event, even if multiple deliveries are related to the same order.
3. **Resource/Actor Mapping**: Resource IDs are mapped to their corresponding names and roles using the provided `Resources Table`.
4. **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered chronologically based on their timestamps.
5. **Other Attributes**: Additional attributes such as customer details, order priority, and delivery notes are included where applicable to provide context.

This event log should serve as a comprehensive representation of the business process, suitable for process mining and analysis.
