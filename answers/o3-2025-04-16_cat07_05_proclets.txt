The picture is made of three separate but related parts that together illustrate how two subjectoriented (SBPM) processes cooperate in a hospital context.

1. Part (a) – “Two procelt classes connected through two channels”  
   • The left swimlane is a procelt (subject) called “Lab visit”.  
     – It starts with an empty circle (start state).  
     – Activities (square boxes) appear in sequence: “Order entry”, “Take blood sample”, “Receive result”, “Judge results”, “Everything is fine / Do tests again”, “Receive updated result”, “Send report”.  
     – Small stickfigure icons above several boxes indicate which role performs the step (doctor, lab assistant).  
     – Decisions are shown with diamonds (“Everything is fine” versus “Do tests again”).  
     – The flow ends with a filled square (end state).

   • The right swimlane is a second procelt called “Lab test”.  
     – It begins with its own start state, contains actions such as “Perform test”, “Make report”, “Finish lab test”, “Perform test again”, “Provide updated report”, and ends with its own end state.  
     – Chemicalanalyst icons mark who carries out each testing activity.

   • The two subjects communicate through two dashed, rounded rectangles labelled “Order system” and “HIS”.  
     – Arrows that leave one subject and enter the other (labelled I1, I2, … I7) represent messages that travel through those channels.  
     – For example, after “Take blood sample” the Labvisit subject sends an order (I3) via the “Order system” channel to the Labtest subject, which triggers “Perform test”.  
     – Later messages return the test report or an updated report if a retest is necessary.

2. Part (b) – “Class diagram containing the two procelt classes”  
   • A compact UMLlike box simply states that one instance of Lab visit (1..1) requires one or more instances of Lab test (1..*), indicating multiplicity and dependency.

3. Part (c) – “Example of a performative”  
   • A singlerow table shows one concrete message exchanged on the “Order system” channel.  
     – Columns specify the time (11:00), channel (Order system), sender (Lab visit – HGB John), receivers (Lab test – HGB John), action (Create), content (“Can you perform a HGB test for John?”), scope (Private), and direction (OUT).

Overall the visualization depicts how a patient’s lab visit process interacts with a laboratory testing process, what messages flow between them, and how one of those messages looks when expressed in machinereadable performative form.
