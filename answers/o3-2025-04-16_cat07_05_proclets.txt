The illustration is composed of three coordinated sub-figures that together show how two collaborative process fragments (“procol classes”) interact during a medical laboratory episode.

1. Sub-figure (a) – Two procol classes connected through two channels  
   • The lefthand procol class is called “Lab visit.”  
     – It starts (black circle) with an “Order entry” task performed by a doctor.  
     – A lab assistant then “Takes blood sample.”  
     – The result is received and a decision step “Judge results” evaluates whether everything is fine or further tests are necessary.  
       • If everything is fine, the process proceeds directly to “Send report” and ends (black square).  
       • Otherwise it loops through “Do tests again,” waits for an “Updated result,” and finally sends the report.  
   • The righthand procol class is called “Lab test.”  
     – A chemical analyst “Performs test,” “Makes report,” and ultimately “Finishes lab test” before termination.  
   • Two dashed rectangular areas represent the communication channels that couple the two procol classes:  
     – “Order system” (messages m0–m3) connects the initial ordering and receipt of the first result.  
     – “HIS” (Hospital Information System, messages m4–m7) handles re-testing and the updated result.  
   • Each dashed arrow labelled m0, m1 … m7 is a performative/message that crosses from one class to the other. Tokens move along the solid arcs inside each class while messages flow along the dashed arcs between classes.

2. Sub-figure (b) – Class diagram excerpt  
   • It simply states that the class “Lab visit” 1..1 requires one or more (1..*) instances of class “Lab test.”

3. Sub-figure (c) – Example of a performative (message)  
   • A tabular entry shows, for 11:00, a message on the “Order system” channel.  
     – Sender: an instance of the Lab-visit class (specifically the HGB test for a patient named John).  
     – Receivers: all Lab-test instances concerning John’s haemoglobin (HGB).  
     – Action: Create.  
     – Content: “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”  
     – Scope: Private.  
     – Direction: OUT (from the Lab-visit class towards the Lab-test class).

Overall, the visualization demonstrates how the two process fragments cooperate: the visit triggers one or more laboratory tests, exchanges results through well-defined message channels, and either finishes normally or loops until satisfactory results are obtained.
