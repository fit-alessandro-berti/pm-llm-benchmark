I'll analyze the sequence and group the events into distinct cases based on the matching attributes and logical flow of activities. From the data, I can identify 3 distinct patient cases:

**Case 1 - ER Patient (45M)**
* Male, age 45, ER department, private insurance
* Events in sequence:
1. 08:05:13 - Register patient
4. 08:10:50 - Initial triage (triage_code=3)
7. 08:15:42 - X-ray imaging (left_leg)
12. 08:23:10 - Doctor consultation (diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
15. 08:30:05 - Patient discharged (followup=outpatient_clinic)

**Case 2 - ER Patient (62F)**
* Female, age 62, ER department, public insurance
* Events in sequence:
2. 08:07:02 - Register patient
5. 08:12:29 - Initial triage (triage_code=2)
8. 08:16:10 - Lab test requested
10. 08:20:27 - Lab test completed
11. 08:22:54 - Doctor consultation (diagnosis=minor_infection)
14. 08:27:00 - Prescription created
17. 08:35:29 - Patient discharged (followup=pharmacy_pickup)

**Case 3 - Surgery Patient (28M)**
* Male, age 28, Surgery department, private insurance
* Events in sequence:
3. 08:07:15 - Register patient
6. 08:13:00 - Doctor consultation (reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
9. 08:16:45 - Surgery preparation
13. 08:25:19 - Surgery performed
16. 08:31:37 - Recovery room
18. 08:40:13 - Patient discharged (followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

The grouping was determined based on:
1. Matching patient demographics (age and gender)
2. Logical sequence of activities
3. Consistent department flows
4. Timestamps following a reasonable progression
5. Related medical context (e.g., diagnosis, procedures, and follow-ups)

Each case shows a complete patient journey from registration to discharge, with appropriate intermediate steps for their respective medical situations.
