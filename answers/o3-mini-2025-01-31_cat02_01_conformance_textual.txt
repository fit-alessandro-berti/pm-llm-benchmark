Below is the analysis of each case with explanations of the deviations:

• Case 1  
– Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order  
– Analysis: This case follows the normative process for orders with sufficient inventory. All activities occur in the expected order, and the process is finalized properly with Close order. No deviation is detected.

• Case 2  
– Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
– Violation: In the normative description, once inventory is confirmed, payment must be authorized before any packaging is done. In this case, "Package items" is executed before "Authorize payment." This violates the rule that payment authorization should precede the packaging of items.

• Case 3  
– Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order  
– Violation: The cancellation branch should be followed by a direct closure (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close). By performing "Ship order" after "Cancel order," this case violates the expectation that fulfillment activities (packaging or shipping) should not occur after a cancellation. In short, shipping should not follow an order cancellation.

• Case 4  
– Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order  
– Analysis: This case matches the prescribed flow for insufficient inventory scenarios. After checking inventory, the order is canceled and then closed. There are no deviations according to the normative process.

• Case 5  
– Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
– Violation: When inventory is sufficient, the normative process requires that the steps proceed through packaging before shipping. In this case, there is no "Package items" activity recorded before "Ship order," which deviates from the established rule that payment authorization should be followed by packaging and then shipping.

Summary of Deviations:  
– Case 2 violates the correct order by packaging items before authorizing payment.  
– Case 3 wrongly performs shipping after an order has been canceled.  
– Case 5 omits the packaging step entirely before shipping.

Thus, Cases 2, 3, and 5 do not follow the intended normative process.
