Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to check each case in the event log against the normative process description and find any violations. Let me start by understanding the normative process thoroughly.

From the description, the process has two main paths: one when inventory is sufficient and another when it's not. The key steps are:

1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
   - If sufficient:
     - Authorize payment
     - Package items
     - Ship order
     - Close order
   - If insufficient:
     - Cancel order
     - Close order

The constraints mentioned are important. For example, payment authorization must come after inventory check and before packaging. Packaging must be after payment authorization and before shipping. Shipping can't happen after cancellation. Closing is always last.

Now, let's go through each case one by one.

**Case 1:**
Sequence is Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. This seems to follow the correct path for sufficient inventory. All steps are in order. No violations here.

**Case 2:**
Sequence is Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, here after Check inventory, they package items before authorizing payment. According to the normative process, payment authorization should come before packaging. So this is a violation. The order of Package and Authorize is reversed. That's a problem.

**Case 3:**
Sequence is Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. After Check inventory, they authorize payment, then cancel. But if inventory is insufficient, they should cancel immediately after check. However, in this case, after check, they did authorize payment first. That's a violation because if inventory is insufficient, you shouldn't proceed to authorize payment. Also, after canceling, they shipped the order, which is against the rule that shipping can't happen after cancellation. So two violations here: authorizing payment before cancellation (if inventory was insufficient) and shipping after cancellation.

**Case 4:**
Sequence is Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. This looks correct for insufficient inventory. They canceled right after check and closed. No steps after cancel, so no violations.

**Case 5:**
Sequence is Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Missing the packaging step. According to the process, after authorizing payment, you should package items before shipping. Here, they skipped packaging and went straight to ship. That's a violation because packaging is required before shipping.

So summarizing the violations:

- Case 2: Package before Authorize payment.
- Case 3: Authorize payment before Cancel (if inventory was insufficient) and Ship after Cancel.
- Case 5: Ship without Packaging.

Wait, but in Case 3, how do we know if inventory was insufficient? The process says if inventory is insufficient, you cancel. But in Case 3, after Check inventory, they authorized payment. That suggests that maybe the inventory was sufficient, but then they canceled. But according to the normative process, once you check inventory and it's sufficient, you proceed to authorize payment. However, in this case, after authorizing payment, they canceled. That's a problem because cancellation should only happen if inventory is insufficient. So even if inventory was sufficient, canceling after authorizing payment is a violation. Alternatively, maybe the inventory check showed insufficient, but they still authorized payment, which is wrong. Either way, the sequence is incorrect. The normative process says that if inventory is insufficient, you cancel immediately after check. If it's sufficient, you proceed to authorize. So in Case 3, after Check, they did Authorize, which implies inventory was sufficient. But then they canceled, which is not part of the sufficient path. So that's a violation because they canceled after authorizing payment, which shouldn't happen. Also, shipping after cancellation is another violation.

So Case 3 has two violations: authorizing payment when they should have canceled (if inventory was insufficient) or canceling after authorizing (which is not allowed). Also, shipping after cancellation.

Case 5 is missing the packaging step. They authorized payment but then shipped without packaging. That's a violation of the packaging before shipping rule.

So the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5.

**Violating Cases and Explanations:**

1. **Case 2**  
   - **Violation:** Packaging items occurred before authorizing payment.  
   - **Explanation:** According to the normative process, payment authorization must precede packaging. The sequence "Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment" reverses the required order. Payment authorization ensures the customer’s payment method is valid *before* preparing items for shipment. Packaging without prior authorization risks fulfilling an order that may not be financially approved.

2. **Case 3**  
   - **Violations:**  
     a. **Authorizing payment before canceling the order** (if inventory was insufficient).  
     b. **Shipping the order after cancellation**.  
   - **Explanation:**  
     - If the inventory check revealed insufficient stock, the process should have canceled the order immediately after "Check inventory." Instead, the system authorized payment (implying inventory was sufficient) and then canceled, which is inconsistent.  
     - Even if inventory was sufficient initially, canceling after payment authorization is illogical, as cancellation should only occur in the insufficient inventory path. Additionally, shipping after cancellation violates the rule that shipping must never follow cancellation.

3. **Case 5**  
   - **Violation:** Shipping the order without packaging items.  
   - **Explanation:** The normative process requires packaging items *after* payment authorization and *before* shipping. Case 5 skips the "Package items" step entirely, proceeding directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order." This bypasses the necessary preparation step, risking improper or unready items being shipped.

---

**Summary of Violations:**  
- **Case 2:** Incorrect order of "Package items" and "Authorize payment."  
- **Case 3:** Unauthorized payment authorization followed by cancellation and shipping post-cancellation.  
- **Case 5:** Missing "Package items" step before shipping.
