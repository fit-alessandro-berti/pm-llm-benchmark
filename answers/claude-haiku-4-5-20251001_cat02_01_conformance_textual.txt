# Analysis of Process Violations

## Summary
**Violating Cases: 2, 3, and 5**
**Compliant Cases: 1 and 4**

## Detailed Violation Analysis

### **Case 1:  COMPLIANT**
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This case follows the normative process exactly as prescribed for a successful fulfillment scenario. All activities occur in the correct logical order with proper prerequisites satisfied before dependent activities.

---

### **Case 2:  VIOLATION**
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  **Package items  Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **"Authorize payment" occurs after "Package items"** — The normative description explicitly states: "Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging." Payment authorization must precede packaging since payment must be confirmed before committing resources to prepare items for shipment.

2. **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"** — Packaging should only occur after authorization is complete. It is illogical to prepare items for shipment before confirming that the customer's payment method is valid and approved.

**Rule Violated:** Payment authorization must be the intermediate step between inventory confirmation and packaging.

---

### **Case 3:  VIOLATION**
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"** — The normative description explicitly states: "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation." Once an order is canceled, it should not be shipped under any circumstances.

2. **"Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order"** — While the timing of payment authorization is less critical in a cancellation scenario, authorizing payment for an order that will be canceled represents inefficient processing and wasted authorization attempts.

3. **Illogical sequence for cancellation path** — When inventory is insufficient (triggering cancellation), the correct flow should be: Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order. This case includes payment authorization and then attempts to ship a canceled order, both of which violate the fundamental logic of the cancellation branch.

**Rules Violated:** 
- "Ship order should never occur after a cancellation"
- The cancellation path should proceed directly from inventory check to cancellation, not through payment authorization

---

### **Case 4:  COMPLIANT**
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This case follows the normative process correctly for an insufficient inventory scenario. After inventory is checked and found to be insufficient, the order is immediately canceled and then closed, with no further fulfillment activities attempted.

---

### **Case 5:  VIOLATION**
Sequence: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order** (missing "Package items")  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **"Ship order" occurs without "Package items"** — The normative description states: "Ship order should only occur after packaging." Items must be physically prepared and packaged before shipment can occur. Shipping an order without a preceding packaging step is logically impossible and violates the process flow.

2. **Missing required activity** — The "Package items" activity is entirely absent from this case, which is a prerequisite for shipping in all fulfillment scenarios.

**Rule Violated:** "Ship order should only occur after packaging and before closing order."
