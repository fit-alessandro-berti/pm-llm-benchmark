### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - **Anomaly:** The average time is approximately 1.04 days with a suspiciously low standard deviation (1 hour), suggesting a rigid schedule.
   
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - **Anomaly:** The average delay is 7 days with a high standard deviation (2 days), indicating significant variability in the time it takes to notify customers after approval.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - **Anomaly:** The average time between assign and close is only 2 hours, which is unusually short, possibly indicating premature closure without intermediate steps like evaluation or approval.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - **Anomaly:** The average time between evaluation and notification is only 5 minutes, suggesting an extremely quick transition that may bypass necessary checks.

### Hypotheses on the Causes of Anomalies

1. **R to P:**
   - **Hypothesis:** A rigid approval process where claims are batched and approved at specific times, leading to consistent delays.
   - **Hypothesis:** Manual intervention causing delays, followed by automated batch processing.

2. **P to N:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Bottlenecks in the notification process, possibly due to high claim volumes or resource constraints.
   - **Hypothesis:** Inconsistent follow-up after approval, leading to varying notification times.

3. **A to C:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Claims are being prematurely closed without proper evaluation or approval, possibly due to incorrect assignment or resource inefficiencies.
   - **Hypothesis:** Technical issues causing skipped steps in the process.

4. **E to N:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Automated systems that trigger notifications immediately after evaluation, bypassing necessary checks.
   - **Hypothesis:** Human error in the evaluation process leading to quick, possibly incorrect, decisions.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Anomalously Short or Long Times:**

   **R to P Anomaly:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, ce1.timestamp AS receive_time, ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_diff
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 14400 -- Less than 40 hours
      OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 > 100800 -- More than 28800 hours
   ORDER BY hours_diff;
   ```

   **P to N Anomaly:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, ce1.timestamp AS approve_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_diff
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 336 -- Less than 14 days
      OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 > 10080 -- More than 28 days
   ORDER BY hours_diff;
   ```

   **A to C Anomaly:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, ce1.timestamp AS assign_time, ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_diff
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 4 -- Less than 4 hours
   ORDER BY hours_diff;
   ```

   **E to N Anomaly:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_diff
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 0.1 -- Less than 1 minute
   ORDER BY hours_diff;
   ```

2. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters, Claim Types, or Regions:**

   **P to N Anomaly by Adjuster:**
   ```sql
   SELECT a.adjuster_id, a.name, COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   JOIN adjusters a ON c.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 > 10080 -- More than 28 days
   GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name
   ORDER BY anomaly_count DESC;
   ```

   **R to P Anomaly by Claim Type:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_type, COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 14400 -- Less than 40 hours
      OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 > 100800 -- More than 28800 hours
   GROUP BY c.claim_type
   ORDER BY anomaly_count DESC;
   ```

3. **Filter by Specific Conditions:**

   **Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, ce1.timestamp AS assign_time, ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_diff
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 < 4 -- Less than 4 hours
   ORDER BY hours_diff;
   ```

   **Claims with Long Delays Between Approval and Notification:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.submission_date, ce1.timestamp AS approve_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_diff
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) / 3600 > 10080 -- More than 28 days
   ORDER BY hours_diff;
   ```

These queries will help identify specific claims where the timing between activities is anomalous and allow for further investigation into the root causes.
