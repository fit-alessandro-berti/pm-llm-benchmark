1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics  
   a. Reconstructing the Actual ShopFloor Process  
      • Ingest MES event log into a processmining tool (e.g., Celonis, ProM, Disco).  
      • Discover the asis process model: extract a directed graph or Petri net of activities (Cutting  Milling  …  Inspection), including loops or rework paths.  
      • Replay each case (JOB####) on the model to obtain timestamps at each handoff and resource allocation.  
   b. Key Performance Metrics & Techniques  
      1. Job flow times, lead times, makespan  
         – For each case, compute:  
            * Flow time = completion time – release time  
            * Lead time relative to due date  
            * Makespan distribution aggregated by month/part family  
         – Visualize with histograms, boxplots, cumulative curves.  
      2. Task waiting (queue) times per machine  
         – For each operation step: Queue time = Task Start – Queue Entry.  
         – Aggregate by machine to find mean/90thpercentile waiting times.  
      3. Resource utilization  
         – For each machine/operator:  
            * Productive time = sum of actual Task Durations  
            * Setup time = sum of actual Setup Durations  
            * Idle time = available time – (productive + setup)  
         – Utilization = productive time ÷ available time; change over time windows.  
      4. Sequencedependent setup times  
         – Extract all setup events: build a transition matrix S where S[i,j] = avg setup time when previous job was type i and next is type j.  
         – Use heatmaps to identify costly transitions.  
      5. Schedule adherence and tardiness  
         – For each case: Tardiness = max(Completion – Due Date, 0).  
         – Compute ontime rate, average tardiness, distribution by priority.  
      6. Disruption impact  
         – Mark intervals of breakdowns or priority changes.  
         – Compare KPIs (waiting times, tardiness rates) in windows before/during/after disruptions.  
         – Perform “whatif” conformance checking: simulate removal of breakdown events to quantify delay impact.  

2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies  
   a. Bottleneck resources  
      • Identify machines with utilization > 85% and high queue times downstream.  
      • Correlate peaks in WIP before that machine with dips in throughput.  
   b. Poor task prioritization  
      • Variant analysis: compare path variants for highpriority vs. lowpriority jobs.  
      • Scatterplot of priority vs actual lead time showing highpriority jobs overtaken by lower ones.  
   c. Suboptimal sequencing  
      • Compute total setup time per shift. Show spikes where sequence transitions in Smatrix are high.  
      • Identify schedules where reordering would cut total setups by 20%.  
   d. Starvation & bullwhip  
      • Timeseries of WIP per work center: observe oscillations (bullwhip) triggered by local dispatch rules.  
      • Trace cases that idle downstream machines for long periods because upstream pushes unrelated work.  
   e. Processmining methods  
      • Bottleneck analysis plugin: highlights slow edges in the process graph.  
      • Variant explorer: isolates top 10 variants of late vs ontime jobs.  
      • Resource contention analysis: detect periods when multiple jobs compete for the same machine.  

3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness  
   a. Static dispatch rules in a dynamic environment  
      • FCFS/Earliest Due Date ignore setup impacts and downstream loads.  
   b. Lack of realtime visibility  
      • No global snapshot: local rules cause oscillations and starvation.  
   c. Inaccurate duration & setup estimates  
      • Planned vs actual durations show large variances, especially on complex parts.  
   d. Poor handling of sequencedependent setups  
      • Setups not considered in dispatch, leading to high changeover times.  
   e. Coordination failures  
      • No feedback loops to balance load or shift priority when breakdowns occur or hot jobs arrive.  
   f. Distinguishing logic vs capacity constraints  
      • Correlate delays with utilization: if a machine is at 100% but still tardy, capacity is the issue; if utilization is moderate yet delay persists, scheduling logic is to blame.  
      • Use processmining causal inference modules to tease out whether delays are due to variability in processing times or rulebased sequencing.  

4. Developing Advanced DataDriven Scheduling Strategies  
   Strategy 1: Enhanced MultiCriteria Dispatching Rules  
      • Core logic: At each machine, rank waiting jobs by a composite score:  
         Score = w1·(Slack / RemainingProcTime) + w2·PriorityRank – w3·ExpectedSetupTime + w4·DownstreamCapacityIndex  
      • Processmining input:  
         – Slack (DueDate – now – avg remaining flow time) from historical flow times.  
         – ExpectedSetupTime from Smatrix based on last processed job.  
         – DownstreamCapacityIndex from realtime WIP levels and utilization data.  
      • Addresses: tardiness (by slack), setup waste, starvation (by downstream index).  
      • Expected impact: 20–30% reduction in average tardiness, 15% cut in setup times, smoother WIP.  

   Strategy 2: Predictive & Robust Scheduling  
      • Core logic: Build predictive models (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting) for:  
         – Task durations (features: part family, operator, machine, previous job seq.)  
         – Breakdown probabilities (features: machine age, runtime since last maintenance).  
      • Use predictive distributions to generate robust schedules via rollinghorizon optimization:  
         – At each planning epoch, solve a mixedinteger program minimizing expected tardiness + setup + breakdown risk.  
      • Processmining input: historical logs train the models; feed realtime event stream for predictions.  
      • Addresses: unpredictability of durations, reactive breakdown handling, more accurate leadtime quotes.  
      • Expected impact: 25% fewer schedule disruptions, 10% reduced WIP, 95% ontime performance.  

   Strategy 3: SequenceDependent Setup Optimization via Batching & Sequencing  
      • Core logic:  
         1. Cluster jobs into setupsimilar families using the Smatrix distances.  
         2. Within each family, apply an approximate TSP solver on the sequence to minimize total setup.  
         3. Dynamically assign batches to bottleneck machines with an insertion heuristic when hot jobs arrive.  
      • Processmining input: transitionmatrix quantifies true setup costs; frequency of families informs batch sizes.  
      • Addresses: excessive setups, makespan, and bottleneck overload.  
      • Expected impact: 40–50% reduction in total setup time on critical machines, 10% throughput gain, balanced resource loads.  

5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement  
   a. DiscreteEvent Simulation (DES)  
      • Build a DES model in Simio/AnyLogic with:  
         – Routing probabilities, processing time distributions, setup time models, breakdown/repair distributions from process mining.  
      • Scenarios to test:  
         1. Baseline (current dispatch rules)  
         2. Strategy 1 under normal load  
         3. Strategy 2 under high load & high breakdown rate  
         4. Strategy 3 with frequent hotjob inserts  
      • Metrics: average tardiness, WIP levels, makespan, utilization, total setup time.  
      • Use ANOVA to statistically compare results.  

   b. Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation  
      • Deploy realtime process mining: stream event logs into a dashboard tracking KPI trends vs thresholds.  
      • Automatic alerts when:  
         – Tardiness rate > target for >3 shifts  
         – Setup times drift above historical bounds for a given seqpair  
         – Utilization imbalances exceed ±10% across shifts  
      • Feedback loop: periodically remine logs, retrain predictive models, recalibrate dispatch rule weights w1…w4, and reoptimize batching clusters.  
      • Governance: monthly “Digital Kaizen” reviews of mining output and scheduling performance, with continuous A/B testing of minor rule tweaks.
