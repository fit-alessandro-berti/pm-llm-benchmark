Below is a BPMN-like textual process model derived from the interview transcripts. It is organized by Lanes (roles), lists Tasks, Sequence Flows, Gateways (decision points + conditions), Artifacts, and Exception / Variation paths. This description is intended to be directly convertible into a BPMN diagram.

Participants / Pools & Lanes
- Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk (Mary)
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
- Purchasing (Purchasing Officer, Dan)
- Department Manager (Carlos)
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) — advisory role
- Supplier (external)
- System (Accounting/Workflow system) — automated notifications/records

Start Event
- Start: "Invoice Received" (trigger: supplier sends invoice, typically by email)

Main Happy-path (typical flow)
1. AP Clerk: Task A1 — "Receive invoice (email)"
2. AP Clerk: Gateway G1 — "Invoice contains PO number?"
   - Yes -> flow to A2
   - No  -> flow to E1 (No-PO handling)
3. AP Clerk: Task A2 — "Log invoice into accounting system"
4. AP Clerk: Task A3 — "Forward invoice to Purchasing to confirm goods/services received"
5. Purchasing: Task P1 — "Confirm receipt of goods/services; compare invoice vs PO (quantities, prices, charges)"
6. Purchasing: Gateway G2 — "Invoice matches PO and receipt confirmed?"
   - Yes -> flow to A4
   - No  -> flow to E2 (Discrepancy handling)
7. AP Clerk: Task A4 — "Match invoice line items against PO in system (reconciliation)"
   - Note: Interviews indicate both Purchasing and AP perform verification; model allows both: P1 (Purchasing confirmation/matching) then A4 (AP system match).
8. System: Task S1 — "Send manager approval request (auto-email) when match & receipt confirmed"
9. Department Manager: Task M1 — "Review invoice + PO + confirmation and Approve/Reject"
10. Gateway G3 — "Manager decision?"
    - Approve -> flow to A5
    - Reject -> flow to E3 (Manager rejects / investigation)
11. AP Clerk: Task A5 — "Schedule approved invoice for payment (add to payment cycle / payment run)"
12. End Event: "Invoice paid (after scheduled payment run)"

Artifacts / Data Objects
- Invoice (incoming document)
- Purchase Order (PO)
- Goods/Services receipt / delivery confirmation (Purchasing confirmation)
- Matching result / reconciliation record in accounting system
- Manager approval record (system email/approval)
- Payment schedule / payment run entry
- Supplier correspondence (emails requesting PO or corrected invoice)
- Contract (used by SRM when checking pricing)

Exception & Variation Paths (detailed)

E1 — No PO on Invoice
- From G1 (No PO):
  - AP Clerk: Task E1.1 — "Request PO/clarification from supplier (send back invoice)"
  - Possible outcomes:
    - Supplier supplies PO/reference or corrected invoice -> loop back to A2 (log) or directly to P1 if already logged.
    - If supplier cannot provide PO and invoice pertains to an informal/contracted service -> AP escalates to AP Supervisor (Rita) -> see E1 escalation below.

E1 escalation (retrospective PO / informal services)
- AP Clerk -> AP Supervisor: Task E1.2 — "Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita) when no PO and cannot be resolved by supplier)"
- AP Supervisor: Task R1 — "Coordinate with department heads / create retrospective PO or decide to reject"
- Outcomes:
  - Retrospective PO created -> flow back to A2/A3 (log & Purchasing confirm)
  - Invoice rejected -> End Event: "Invoice rejected / returned to supplier"

E2 — Discrepancy Detected by Purchasing or AP
- From G2 (No), or from A4 if mismatch:
  - Purchasing: Task P2 — "Contact supplier to resolve discrepancy (quantity, price, extra charges) OR instruct AP to hold invoice"
  - If Purchasing can't resolve quickly -> escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita) (flow to R1) OR loop in Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) if contractual/pricing dispute.
- Supplier Relationship Manager: Task K1 (advisory) — "Contact supplier; check contract terms; confirm correct price; request revised invoice if required"
- Possible outcomes:
  - Supplier sends corrected invoice -> loop back to A2 (log and repeat confirmation/match)
  - Supplier provides justification and Purchasing accepts -> continue to A4 -> S1
  - Unresolved -> escalate to AP Supervisor (R1) -> decide retrospective PO, approve exception, or reject.

E3 — Manager Rejects / Investigates
- From G3 (Reject):
  - Department Manager: Task M2 — "Request investigation / hold invoice"
  - AP Clerk: Task A6 — "Coordinate investigation (with Purchasing and possibly Supplier Relationship Manager)"
  - If issues resolved (pricing error corrected, budget approval obtained, PO/receipt clarified) -> loop back to A4 or S1
  - If unresolved -> escalate to AP Supervisor (R1) -> possible creation of retrospective PO, rejection, or alternative resolution.

Additional variations / notes
- Who performs matching: Interviews indicate both Purchasing and AP perform checks. Represent as sequential verifications: Purchasing P1 (confirm receipt & initial compare), then AP A4 (system reconciliation). In some organizations these may be combined or done in parallel — model allows sequential handoff; note ambiguity.
- Flow after Purchasing confirmation: Dan assumes that after Purchasing confirms he "assumes Mary or her team moves it to the manager." Mary explicitly logs then forwards to Purchasing and then after confirmation she matches and sends to manager. Model follows Mary's detailed sequence; note variance: "In some cases, after Purchasing confirmation, Purchasing may directly notify manager" (rare/uncertain).
- Manager rejects are infrequent ("once every couple months") but included as a gateway.
- AP Supervisor (Rita) does not perform final approvals but coordinates exception resolution so invoices don't get stuck — modeled as escalation handler.

Sequence Flow Summary (compact)
- Start -> A1 -> G1
  - G1 (Yes) -> A2 -> A3 -> P1 -> G2
    - G2 (Yes) -> A4 -> S1 -> M1 -> G3
      - G3 (Approve) -> A5 -> End (Invoice paid)
      - G3 (Reject) -> E3 investigation -> (resolve -> back to A4/S1) or escalate to R1 -> End (reject) or back to flow
    - G2 (No) -> E2 discrepancy handling -> (supplier correction / SRM involvement / R1 escalation -> back to A2/A4)
  - G1 (No) -> E1 no-PO handling -> (supplier provides PO -> back to A2) or escalate to R1 -> (retrospective PO -> back to A2) or reject -> End

Timing / Triggers / Automation
- System automatically sends manager approval email when invoice is matched and receipt confirmed (S1).
- Payment scheduling is performed by AP after manager approval (A5) and follows organizational payment cycles (not modeled in detail).

Assumptions & Ambiguities (explicit)
- Ambiguity: Exact ownership of the invoice-vs-PO "matching" step is described by both AP and Purchasing. I modeled it as a two-step verification: Purchasing confirms receipt & performs initial check; AP performs the system reconciliation. If implementing, represent both checks (two tasks) or collapse them into a single "Verify invoice vs PO" task assigned jointly.
- Ambiguity: After Purchasing confirms receipt, whether Purchasing ever sends invoices directly to Manager (bypassing AP routing) is unclear. Interviews suggest AP typically handles routing; note occasional variations.
- Ambiguity: Timing and SLA thresholds for escalation (how long AP waits before escalating to Supervisor) are not specified and should be defined when operationalizing the model.
- Ambiguity: Who updates the system when supplier sends corrected invoice — assumed AP logs the revised invoice (A2) but could be Purchasing in practice.

Key KPIs / Process checkpoints (suggested from interview context)
- PO presence rate (percentage of invoices with valid PO)
- Time from invoice receipt to log into system
- Time from log to Purchasing confirmation
- Time from match to manager approval
- Exception rate (discrepancies / no-PO / supplier corrections)
- Number and time in escalations to AP Supervisor

Short textual swimlane mapping (for diagramming)
- AP Clerk (Mary): Receive invoice -> Check PO -> Log invoice -> Forward to Purchasing -> Match in system -> Send to Manager -> Schedule payment
- Purchasing (Dan): Confirm receipt -> Compare invoice vs PO -> Contact supplier if discrepancy -> Respond to AP
- Department Manager (Carlos): Review & Approve/Reject (receives system notification)
- AP Supervisor (Rita): Handle escalations/unresolvable discrepancies -> create retrospective PO or coordinate rejection
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen): Liaise with supplier for contractual/price disputes (advisory)
- Supplier: Provide invoice, possibly revised invoice or PO

End states
- End 1: Invoice paid (normal completion)
- End 2: Invoice rejected and returned to supplier (if unresolved)
- End 3: Invoice processed with retrospective PO and then paid (exception but completed)

If you want, I can render this into a more formal BPMN XML (bpmn 2.0) skeleton, or produce a diagram-ready list of nodes with unique IDs and explicit arrows for direct import/draw. Which would you prefer?
