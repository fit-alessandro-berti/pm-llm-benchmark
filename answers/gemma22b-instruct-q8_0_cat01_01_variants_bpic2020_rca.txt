The provided data does not contain enough information to pinpoint the specific root causes of the performance issues. Here's why:

**Data Limitations:**

* **Lack of Context:** The data simply lists frequency (how often a process happens) and performance (time or resources spent). It doesn't offer details about the steps within each variant, the time taken for each step, or what processes might be contributing to bottlenecks. 
* **Missing Information about Performance:**  While you have 'performance', it only offers one metric. You would need information on:
    * Breakdown of performance by different stages (e.g., how long is the approval process vs. payment handling). 
    * Impact of various processes on overall performance (e.g., are some steps significantly slower than others, even if they happen frequently?).

**What We Could Consider Based on the Data:**

1. **Approval & Handling Delays:**  A significant amount of time is being spent in the process variants involving approval by administration, budget owner, or supervisors.
    * **Potential Root Cause:** There might be delays in decision-making due to bureaucratic processes (lack of clear communication), internal resistance, missing information, etc.

2. **Missing Information/Data Entry Errors:** 
    * **Potential Root Cause:** If there are errors in data input during processing or approvals, it could cause a significant delay or even a full rejection if data is incorrect.

3. **Request & Payment Processes:** The number of requests and payments processed (frequency) suggests a potentially heavy workload. However, the time taken for those steps needs to be analyzed separately:
    *  **Potential Root Cause:** It's possible the payment process itself is slow or there are delays in data transfer or authorization. 

4. **Unclear Process Flow:** The diverse variants could indicate that the process itself has several sub-processes that aren't explicitly defined, leading to potential inefficiencies and bottlenecks:
    * **Potential Root Cause:** Some steps might be overly complex, redundant, or there are issues with step sequencing that causes delays.


**To Improve Analysis:**

1. **More Performance Metrics:**  Collect time data for each stage within the process variants.
2. **Process Mapping & Analysis:** Create a visual flow diagram of the process to see where bottlenecks might be occurring. 
3. **Identify Data Dependencies and Delays:** Analyze how each step relies on previous steps, identifying potential bottlenecks if one step delays others. 


**In Conclusion:**  It's essential to delve deeper into the specific processes involved and understand the complexities within those processes before definitively identifying the root causes of performance issues.
