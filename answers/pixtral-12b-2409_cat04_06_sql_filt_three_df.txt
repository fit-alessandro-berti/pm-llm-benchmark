To achieve the desired result, you can follow these steps in your DuckDB SQL query:

1. Identify cases that contain the sequence of activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' in direct succession.
2. Among those cases, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events is more than 5 days.
3. Exclude these cases from the final result.

Here's the SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
WITH filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(timestamp) AS first_timestamp,
        MAX(timestamp) AS last_timestamp
    FROM
        event_log
    WHERE
        activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 3
        AND (
            (activity = 'Create Order' AND EXISTS (
                SELECT 1
                FROM event_log e2
                WHERE e2.case_id = event_log.case_id
                AND e2.activity = 'Confirm Order'
                AND e2.timestamp > event_log.timestamp
                AND e2.timestamp - event_log.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
            ))
            OR (activity = 'Confirm Order' AND EXISTS (
                SELECT 1
                FROM event_log e2
                WHERE e2.case_id = event_log.case_id
                AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
                AND e2.timestamp < event_log.timestamp
                AND event_log.timestamp - e2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
            ))
        )
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```

### Explanation:

1. **filtered_cases CTE**:
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) identifies cases that contain the specified sequence of activities.
   - It groups by `case_id` and filters for cases where the count of distinct activities is exactly 3.
   - It further checks the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events to ensure it is more than 5 days.

2. **Main Query**:
   - The main query selects all events from `event_log`.
   - It excludes cases that are identified in the `filtered_cases` CTE.

This query ensures that you return all events from `event_log` except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and the timing condition.
