Here's a DuckDB SQL query that solves the process mining benchmark:

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    -- Step 1: Construct activity sequences for each case
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    -- Step 2: Count cases per variant and rank them
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(case_id) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Select top K variants (replace K with desired number)
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE rank <= K  -- Replace K with the actual number you want
)
-- Step 4: Return all events from cases belonging to top K variants
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

**Key components explained:**

1. **`case_sequences` CTE**: Groups events by `case_id` and creates ordered activity sequences using `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`. Activities are joined with '->' separator.

2. **`variant_counts` CTE**: Groups cases by their activity sequences to identify unique variants, counts how many cases follow each variant, and ranks them by frequency using `ROW_NUMBER()`.

3. **`top_k_variants` CTE**: Filters to keep only the top K variants by rank.

4. **Final query**: Joins the original event log with case sequences and filters to return only events from cases that belong to the top K variants.

**To use this query:**
- Replace `K` in the `WHERE rank <= K` clause with your desired number of top variants
- The query returns all original event log columns for cases belonging to top K variants
- Results are ordered by case ID and timestamp for readability

**Example usage for top 5 variants:**
```sql
WHERE rank <= 5
```

This solution efficiently handles the four requirements while maintaining good performance through the use of CTEs and appropriate indexing opportunities.
