**Overall Structure:**

The image depicts a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram. It illustrates a workflow for dispatching goods, likely within a computer hardware shop. The diagram is divided into three horizontal swimlanes, representing different departments or roles:

1.  **Logistics:** At the very top.
2.  **Dispatch of goods - Computer Hardware Shop (Secretary):** In the middle.
3.  **Warehouse:** At the bottom.

**Workflow Description (Following the diagram from left to right):**
*   **Start:** The process begins with "Ship goods" in the Secretary swimlane.
*  **Clarify Shipping Method:** Determining, if it needs special Handling.
*   **Check Insurance:** Checks customer data, if an insurance is required, that leads to the activity in Logistics to "insure parcel".
*  **Labeling:** Writing package information to the package.
*   **Logistics Selection:**
    *   The secretary gets offers from three logistics companies.
    *   A logistic company is selected, and the order is placed.
*   **Warehouse Actions:**
    *   Goods are packaged.
    *    There is time trigger.
    *    A customer gets notified about delay.
    *   Paperwork is filled out.
    *   The package is moved to a pickup area.
*   **End:** The process concludes with "Shipment prepared".

**Key Elements:**

*   **Rectangles:** Represent tasks or activities (e.g., "Clarify shipment method," "Package goods").
*   **Diamonds:** Represent gateways or decision points (e.g., "Special handling?").
*   **Circles:**
    *   Plain circles: represent start and end events.
    *    With a little plus inside, represent a gateway that combines flows.
    *    Circles with different inner elements indicate different triggers.
*   **Arrows:** Indicate the flow of the process.
*    Database icon, indicates Customer information.
*   **Swimlanes:** Organize activities by responsible party.

**In essence, the diagram outlines the steps involved in processing an order, from receiving the order to preparing the shipment, including decisions about shipping method, insurance, logistics provider, and warehouse procedures.**
