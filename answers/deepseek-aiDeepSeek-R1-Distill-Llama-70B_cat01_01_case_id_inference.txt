Alright, so I'm looking at this problem where I have a series of hospital process events, and my task is to group them into separate cases based on the attributes provided. Each case represents a distinct patient journey, but there's no explicit case ID, so I need to figure out which events belong together.

First, I need to understand the structure of each event. Each line has a timestamp, activity, resource, department, patient's age and gender, and additional info. The key here is to find a way to match these events logically to each patient.

I notice that each event is related to a specific patient, so I should look for consistent patient attributes across events. The most straightforward attributes are patient_age and patient_gender. If multiple events share the same age and gender and occur in a logical sequence, they likely belong to the same case.

Let me go through the events one by one and see if I can group them based on these attributes.

1. Event 1: 45, M. This is the first event, so it's the start of a case. I'll note the age and gender as 45, M and assign a tentative case ID, say Case 1.

2. Event 2: 62, F. A new age and gender, so this is likely the start of another case, Case 2.

3. Event 3: 28, M. Another new age and gender; this would be Case 3.

4. Event 4: 45, M. Matches the age and gender of Event 1, so it belongs to Case 1.

5. Event 5: 62, F. Matches Event 2, so it's part of Case 2.

6. Event 6: 28, M. Matches Event 3, so part of Case 3.

7. Event 7: 45, M. Case 1 continues with an X-ray.

8. Event 8: 62, F. Case 2 gets a lab test requested.

9. Event 9: 28, M. Case 3 is preparing for surgery.

10. Event 10: 62, F. Lab test completed for Case 2.

11. Event 11: 62, F. Doctor consultation for diagnosis in Case 2.

12. Event 12: 45, M. Another consultation in Case 1.

13. Event 13: 28, M. Surgery performed in Case 3.

14. Event 14: 62, F. Prescription created for Case 2.

15. Event 15: 45, M. Patient discharged from ER in Case 1.

16. Event 16: 28, M. Recovery room in Surgery for Case 3.

17. Event 17: 62, F. Patient discharged from ER in Case 2.

18. Event 18: 28, M. Patient discharged from Surgery in Case 3.

So, using the patient's age and gender, I've managed to group the events into three cases: Case 1 (45, M), Case 2 (62, F), and Case 3 (28, M). 

I should also verify the sequence and activities to ensure consistency. For example, Case 1 starts with registration, moves to triage, X-ray, consultation, and ends with discharge. Similarly, Case 2 has registration, triage, lab tests, diagnosis, prescription, and discharge. Case 3 involves registration, consultation, surgery preparation, surgery, recovery, and discharge. All these sequences make sense for each patient's journey without overlapping or conflicting activities.

I think this grouping makes sense because each case follows a logical flow of a patient's visit, from registration through various treatments to discharge, with consistent age, gender, and department transitions.

To determine the case groupings, we analyze the attributes of each event, focusing on `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, as these are consistent across a single patient's journey. Events belonging to the same case will share these attributes and follow a logical sequence of activities.

### Case Groupings:

**Case 1 (Patient: 45, Male)**
1. Event 1: Register patient (ER)
4. Event 4: Initial triage (ER)
7. Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology)
12. Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER)
15. Event 15: Patient discharged (ER)

**Case 2 (Patient: 62, Female)**
2. Event 2: Register patient (ER)
5. Event 5: Initial triage (ER)
8. Event 8: Lab test requested (ER)
10. Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory)
11. Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER)
14. Event 14: Prescription created (ER)
17. Event 17: Patient discharged (ER)

**Case 3 (Patient: 28, Male)**
3. Event 3: Register patient (Surgery)
6. Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery)
9. Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery)
13. Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery)
16. Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery)
18. Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery)

### Summary of Groupings:
- **Case 1**: 45-year-old male patient treated in the ER.
- **Case 2**: 62-year-old female patient treated in the ER.
- **Case 3**: 28-year-old male patient undergoing surgery.

This grouping ensures that events are logically connected, following the patient's journey from registration through treatment to discharge.
