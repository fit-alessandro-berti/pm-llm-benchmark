1. Proposed high-level activities (what a domain-expert would see in the MES dashboard)

| # | High-level Activity | Typical duration | Low-level events that belong here | Dominant resource | Why it is one logical step |
|---|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | Material Preparation |  20 s | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place on table, Align sheet, Pre-heat sheet | Operator A + Robot Arm #2 + Heating Unit #1 | All actions that convert “incoming inventory” into a correctly located, identified and tempered blank that is ready for value-adding work |
| 2 | Weld Assembly |  20 s | Pick-up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B | Operator B | Manual joining sub-process: tool change + consecutive welds on the same part; short, uninterrupted cycle |
| 3 | In-Line Weld QC |  10 s | Measure weld integrity | Quality Sensor #1 | Fully automatic check that directly follows the welds; decides whether the part may continue |
| 4 | Surface Finishing |  30 s | Apply protective coating, Dry coating | Coating Unit #3 + Heating Unit #2 | Chemical treatment sub-process: apply layer + cure; resources dedicated to coating only |
| 5 | Final Visual Inspection |  5 s | Visual check | Operator C | Last human verification before the case leaves the cell; distinct resource and clearly separated in time |

2. Quick rules used to create the groups (can be encoded in an ETL script)

- Same CaseID.
- Activities executed by the same resource / resource family OR by a functionally linked successor (robot arm  heating unit  coating unit).
- No idle gap > 15 s between consecutive events inside the same group.
- Quality measurements are ripped out into their own group because they represent a decision gate.
- Manual inspection at the very end is always the final step.

3. Resulting “lifted” trace (per CaseID)

| Step | Activity | Start | End | Resources |
|------|----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | Material Preparation | 08:00:05 | 08:00:25 | Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1 |
| 2 | Weld Assembly | 08:01:00 | 08:01:12 | Operator B |
| 3 | In-Line Weld QC | 08:01:20 | 08:01:20 | Quality Sensor #1 |
| 4 | Surface Finishing | 08:01:30 | 08:01:50 | Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2 |
| 5 | Final Visual Inspection | 08:02:00 | 08:02:00 | Operator C |

Every low-level event is accounted for exactly once; the 12 original rows collapse into five intuitive process stages that mirror a standard sheet-metal production flow: Prepare  Join  Check  Coat  Verify.
