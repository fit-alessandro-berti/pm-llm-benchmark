### **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

#### **Reconstructing Job Flow and Task Execution Using Process Mining**
To analyze the current scheduling performance, process mining techniques will be applied to the event logs to reconstruct the actual flow of jobs and tasks. The following steps outline the approach:

1. **Event Log Preprocessing:**
   - Cleanse and enrich the raw MES event logs by ensuring consistent timestamps, resolving missing or conflicting entries, and mapping activities to their corresponding resources (machines and operators).
   - Add derived attributes such as task waiting times (queue times), setup durations, and deviations from planned durations.

2. **Process Discovery:**
   - Use algorithms like **Directly Follows Graph (DFG)** or **Inductive Miner** to visualize the actual execution paths of jobs across machines. This helps identify variability in job routings and deviations from planned sequences.
   - Highlight bottlenecks by analyzing resource contention and frequent rework loops (if any).

3. **Conformance Checking:**
   - Compare the discovered process model against an ideal or planned process model to quantify deviations. Tools like **token replay** can measure how often jobs deviate from expected routes or timings.

4. **Performance Analysis Metrics:**
   - **Job Flow Times and Lead Times:** Compute the total time each job spends in the system (from release to completion) using the `case duration` metric. Analyze distributions to identify outliers and trends.
   - **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):** For each machine/work center, calculate the time jobs spend waiting in queues before processing starts. Aggregate this data to identify periods of high congestion.
   - **Resource Utilization:** Break down machine/operator utilization into productive time, idle time, and setup time. Use metrics like:
     - **Utilization Rate = Productive Time / Total Available Time**
     - **Setup Time Ratio = Setup Time / Total Processing Time**
   - **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** Analyze the `Setup Required` attribute alongside the sequence of jobs processed on a machine. Group similar setups (e.g., material type transitions) and compute average setup durations for different sequences.
   - **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:** Measure the difference between actual completion times and due dates. Track the frequency and magnitude of delays using metrics like:
     - **Tardiness = max(0, Completion Time – Due Date)**
     - **On-Time Delivery Rate = Jobs Completed On-Time / Total Jobs**
   - **Impact of Disruptions:** Identify events like breakdowns (`Breakdown Start`) and priority changes (`Priority Change`). Correlate these disruptions with subsequent delays or rescheduling actions.

5. **Root Cause Analysis via Drill-Down:**
   - Perform root cause analysis by filtering logs based on specific conditions (e.g., late jobs, high-priority jobs). Compare characteristics such as task durations, queue lengths, and resource availabilities between on-time and delayed jobs.

### **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

#### **Key Pathologies Identified Through Process Mining**
Based on the performance analysis, the following inefficiencies are likely to emerge:

1. **Bottleneck Resources:**
   - Machines with consistently high utilization rates and long queue times indicate bottlenecks. Bottleneck analysis tools in process mining (e.g., activity frequency heatmaps) can pinpoint critical work centers.
   - Example: If `CUT-01` shows significantly higher utilization than other cutting machines, it is a bottleneck.

2. **Poor Task Prioritization:**
   - Variants where high-priority or near-due-date jobs experience excessive delays suggest suboptimal prioritization rules.
   - Variant analysis can compare the flow of on-time vs. late jobs to identify patterns contributing to tardiness.

3. **Suboptimal Sequencing Increasing Setup Times:**
   - Frequent switches between dissimilar jobs increase setup durations. Sequence analysis can reveal opportunities for batching similar jobs to minimize setups.

4. **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
   - Upstream bottlenecks may lead to downstream starvation. Resource contention analysis can show periods when downstream machines remain idle due to lack of input.

5. **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
   - High WIP levels at upstream stages propagate variability downstream. Analyze WIP trends over time to identify amplification effects.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

#### **Potential Root Causes**
The issues stem from several interrelated factors:

1. **Static Dispatching Rules:**
   - Localized rules like First-Come-First-Served fail to account for global constraints such as remaining processing time, downstream availability, or sequence-dependent setups.

2. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
   - Without real-time updates on machine status, queue lengths, and job progress, schedulers cannot adapt dynamically to changing conditions.

3. **Inaccurate Estimations:**
   - Overly optimistic task duration estimates exacerbate delays. Historical data reveals discrepancies between planned and actual durations.

4. **Ineffective Handling of Setups:**
   - Ignoring sequence-dependent setup times leads to inefficient sequencing, increasing overall makespan.

5. **Coordination Gaps:**
   - Poor synchronization between work centers results in idle machines or blocked flows.

#### **Differentiating Between Scheduling Logic and Resource Limitations**
Process mining helps isolate issues:
- **Scheduling Logic Issues:** Patterns like unnecessary idle times or poor prioritization point to flaws in decision-making.
- **Capacity Limitations:** Persistent high utilization despite optimal sequencing indicates insufficient capacity.

### **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**
- **Core Logic:** Develop dynamic dispatching rules that consider multiple factors simultaneously:
  - Remaining processing time
  - Due date proximity
  - Priority level
  - Downstream machine load
  - Estimated sequence-dependent setup time
- **Data Usage:** Leverage historical data to estimate setup times and task durations accurately.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduces tardiness and improves throughput by aligning decisions with global objectives.

#### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling**
- **Core Logic:** Use historical task duration distributions and predictive maintenance insights to generate realistic schedules. Incorporate probabilistic models to anticipate potential disruptions.
- **Data Usage:** Mine task durations, breakdown frequencies, and repair times to build predictive models.
- **Expected Impact:** Proactively avoids bottlenecks and minimizes delays caused by unplanned events.

#### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization**
- **Core Logic:** Minimize sequence-dependent setup times through intelligent batching and optimized sequencing at bottleneck machines.
- **Data Usage:** Analyze historical setup patterns to group similar jobs and reduce transition times.
- **Expected Impact:** Lowers overall makespan and improves resource efficiency.
