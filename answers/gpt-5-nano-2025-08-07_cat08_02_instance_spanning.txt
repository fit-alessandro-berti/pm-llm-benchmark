Below is a structured, data-driven strategy to address instance-spanning constraints in the e-commerce fulfillment center. The focus is on using process mining to identify, quantify, and mitigate dependencies that cross multiple orders (cases) and time horizons.

1) Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

Goal
- Formally identify and quantify how the four instance-spanning constraints (Shared Cold-Packing, Shipping Batching, Priority Handling, Hazardous Material Limits) affect end-to-end order performance.
- Separate waiting caused by within-instance factors (e.g., long activity durations) from waiting caused by between-instance factors (e.g., contention for a shared resource, batching dependencies).

What to do with the event log
- Enrich and align the existing log to clearly expose resource occupancy, cross-order dependencies, and batch-affecting moments.
- Key derived signals per order (case):
  - Requires Cold Packing (boolean)
  - Hazardous Material (boolean)
  - Order Type (Standard, Express)
  - Destination Region
  - Timestamps for each activity (Order Received, Item Picking, Packing, Quality Check, Shipping Label Gen.)
  - Resource IDs for each activity
  - Batch context (if Shipping Label Gen is part of a batch; batch ID when present)

Techniques and metrics (per constraint)

A. Shared Cold-Packing (limited specialized stations)
- Detection
  - Identify all Packing events that use a Cold-Packing-restricted resource (e.g., Cold-Packing line or dedicated stations) for orders that require cold packing.
  - Build a per-resource timeline: sequence of packing-start and packing-end times for Cold-Packing stations.
- Metrics to quantify impact
  - Cold-packing wait time: for each order that requires cold packing, waiting_time_cp = actual_packing_start_time  earliest_available_cp_time (i.e., when the next cold-packing station becomes available).
  - Cold-packing utilization: sum of busy time on all Cold-Packing stations divided by total available time.
  - Cold-packing queue length: average and max number of orders waiting for Cold-Packing at any moment.
  - Time-to-packing after prior step: duration from previous activity completion to Packing-start for cold-packing orders (to separate upstream delays from resource contention).
- Within vs. between
  - Within: duration of the packing activity itself for each order.
  - Between: waiting times caused by other orders occupying Cold-Packing stations (resource contention).

B. Batching for Shipping
- Detection
  - Identify Shipping Label Generation events and their batch IDs (if the log indicates Batch B1, B2, etc.) or region-based batching signals.
- Metrics to quantify impact
  - Batch formation delay: time from when the first order in a region is ready for shipping to when the batch is released (last order in the batch completes packing and then shipping label is generated).
  - Batch wait time per order: waiting time introduced by batching (time between last needed packing/QA event and shipping label generation, when the batch must wait for other orders in the same region).
  - Batch size distribution and batch completion rate: average number of orders per batch; proportion of orders processed outside batch windows.
  - Region-level throughput: orders per hour aggregated by region, before vs after batching.
- Within vs. between
  - Within: the time an individual order spends in its own processing steps.
  - Between: the waiting time caused by batch formation and batch release.

C. Priority Handling (Express Orders)
- Detection
  - Identify Express orders and flag any interruptions or preemption events at any shared resource (e.g., Packing, Cold-Packing, QC).
- Metrics to quantify impact
  - Preemption events: count of times an Express order preempts a standard order at a shared resource.
  - Preemption duration: total time where a standard order is paused or delayed due to an Express order using the same resource.
  - Impact on standard orders: average delay induced in Standard orders when an Express order arrives at the same resource (e.g., difference between actual start and expected start time absent Express interruption).
  - Express SLA attainment: percentage of Express orders meeting their accelerated lead times.
- Within vs. between
  - Within: Express order’s own processing time.
  - Between: delays introduced to standard orders due to sharing of the resource with Express orders.

D. Regulatory Compliance: Hazardous Materials (HM) Limits
- Detection
  - For every time window (e.g., 15–60 minutes), track the number of orders simultaneously undergoing Packing or QC with Hazardous Materials flag true.
- Metrics to quantify impact
  - HM concurrency violation risk: whether HM orders ever surpass the regulatory cap (e.g., more than 10 HM orders simultaneously in Packing or QC).
  - HM-related waiting time: additional wait time caused by HM limits (e.g., time to start packing/QC for HM orders when the cap is reached).
  - HM queue length and wait distribution: how many HM orders are waiting at peak times; distribution of their delays.
  - Compliance rate: proportion of time windows where HM limit is respected.
- Within vs. between
  - Within: duration of HM activity for each HM order.
  - Between: waiting caused by HM cap being reached (i.e., cross-order contention).

Differentiation techniques (within vs between)
- Resource-centric queueing view
  - For each resource, compute the discrepancy between when the resource becomes available and when an order actually starts (waiting caused by contention with other orders).
- Cause attribution
  - Attribute waiting to resource contention by analyzing the difference between actual packing start times and the latest end time of any prior order using the same resource.
  - Attribute batch-induced waiting by mapping order events to batch IDs and measuring how batch formation/release times affect individual orders.
- Causality and comparison
  - Compare observed waiting times to a baseline model (no contention, unlimited HM capacity, no batching) derived from historical low-variance periods to isolate the portion of waiting caused by the constraint.
- Data science helps
  - Build regression or survival models to estimate waiting time as a function of the constraint indicators (e.g., number of HM orders, number of active Cold-Packing stations, batch size, express arrival rate).

Why this matters
- This section translates raw event data into concrete, measurable “constraint signatures.” These signatures quantify how much each constraint slows end-to-end lead times and where to intervene.

2) Analyzing Constraint Interactions

What interactions are plausible (examples)
- Express + Cold-Packing
  - An Express order arriving for packing may require pausing a standard order currently using a Cold-Packing station. This can increase the standard order’s waiting time and disrupt the packing throughput for the day, potentially delaying the batch release and shipping label generation.
- Batching + HM Limits
  - If a region’s batch contains HM orders, the HM limit in Packing/QC can become a soft bottleneck. The batch may be forced to wait for HM-capacity to free up, lengthening the batch formation time and delaying all orders in that region.
- HM Limits + Overall Resource Utilization
  - HM orders may congest core packing/QC resources, causing ripple effects that delay items downstream, including those not hazardous. If non-HM orders must wait for HM orders to clear, the entire flow slows down, magnifying batching and express preemption effects.
- Batch formation and express handling
  - If an Express order is part of a region with a large batch, prioritizing the Express order may force the batch to reconfigure mid-formation, or induce preemption within the batch’s packing/QC steps, affecting other orders in the same batch.
- Upstream/downstream coupling
  - Delays in Item Picking or Packing due to resource contention (Cold-Packing, HM limits) directly affect the timing of subsequent QC and Shipping Label Gen steps, thereby affecting the batch’s release timing and regional delivery windows.

Why understanding interactions is crucial
- Interactions create non-linear effects: optimizing one constraint in isolation (e.g., prioritizing Express) may worsen another (e.g., batch delay or HM violations).
- A joint view enables design of policies that respect global constraints (e.g., HM caps, batch deadlines) while still meeting local objectives (e.g., Express SLA).
- It supports more robust and transferable optimization strategies (policies that perform well under peak demand and distribution of hazard orders rather than only under baseline conditions).

3) Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

Here are three concrete strategies (with practical operational details) that explicitly account for the interdependencies described. Each strategy maps to specific constraints, describes the changes, leverages data/analysis, and states expected outcomes.

Strategy 1: Dynamic, Priority-Aware Cold-Packing Resource Allocation (Cross-Cutting: Shared Cold-Packing, Priority Handling, and Batch Interaction)
- Constraint addressed
  - Shared Cold-Packing; Priority Handling; batching implications when Express orders and cold-packing compete; HM considerations when HM orders are involved.
- What to change
  - Implement a real-time, priority-aware scheduler for Cold-Packing stations (including any designated Cold-Packing or near-equivalent packing lines).
  - Create two queues per Cold-Packing resource:
    - Express queue: orders requiring expedited processing (Express) or those with high-priority attributes (e.g., high customer SLA, regional urgency).
    - Standard queue: regular orders, including those that are HM or non-HM with lower priority.
  - Introduce controlled preemption rules:
    - When an Express order arrives and no Cold-Packing station is free, preempt a non-HM Standard order currently occupying a Cold-Packing station, if penalty bounds are acceptable (e.g., re-queue timing or re-assign to a non-Cold-Packing route within acceptable SLA).
    - If the preempted order has a high downstream risk (e.g., in a batch that is critical for ship date), apply a stricter policy to avoid breaking valuable batch coherence.
  - Reserve slots for HM-aware batching: if HM orders are present, ensure that the preemption policy does not cause HM orders to exceed the threshold at any moment.
- How it leverages data/analysis
  - Use historical data to estimate Express arrival rates, typical preemption penalties, and HM-order distributions. Calibrate the preemption thresholds to minimize SLA breaches while avoiding excessive churn.
  - Use predictive models to forecast short-term Cold-Packing demand and pre-load slots for high-priority orders when predicted demand exceeds capacity.
- Expected outcomes
  - Faster Express lead times at protective cost to Standard orders; better overall adherence to Express SLAs.
  - Lower idle time for Cold-Packing stations because of smarter allocation.
  - Reduced risk of HM cap violations by aligning high-priority orders with available HM-safe windows.
- Practical notes
  - Requires operational discipline and governance to avoid excessive preemption that harms long-running Standard orders.
  - Implement visibility: live dashboards showing queue lengths, expected wait times, and preemption events per resource.

Strategy 2: Dynamic Batching with Hazard-Aware and Regionally Optimized Release
- Constraint addressed
  - Batching for Shipping; HM limits; region-level performance.
- What to change
  - Replace fixed regional batching with a dynamic, decision-theoretic batching planner that forms and releases batches based on:
    - Predicted completion times for each order’s upstream steps (picking, packing, QC).
    - Current HM counts and forecast HM inflow; ensure no batch would push HM concurrency over the cap.
    - Region-specific shipping deadlines and route optimization (delivery window alignment).
    - Batch-size adjustment: allow variable batch sizes (e.g., 3–12 orders) depending on predicted release time and resource availability.
  - Batch formation triggers:
    - Trigger batch release when the predicted batch completion time is within a target window and the HM cap will not be breached in the next interval.
    - If HM orders are present, form smaller HM-safe batches or separate HM batches to prevent crossing the cap.
  - Batch coherence: preserve order-to-batch integrity where possible but allow re-grouping when regional delivery windows demand speed.
- How it leverages data/analysis
  - Analyze historical batch sizes, region-based demand, and HM incidence to build a forecast model for batch formation timing.
  - Use optimization (e.g., a rolling horizon MILP or heuristic) to balance batch size, release time, and HM constraints.
  - Calibrate using retroactive test runs on three months of log data to estimate gains in batch completion and reduction in waiting times.
- Expected outcomes
  - Reduced batch-induced waits by releasing batches at optimal times rather than fixed schedules.
  - Better HM-compliant sequencing with no policy violations, and improved region-level throughput.
  - More predictable shipping label generation timing and fewer surprises during peak periods.
- Practical notes
  - May require changes to WMS/ERP batch signals and collaboration with routing to ensure that batch release aligns with regional delivery windows.

Strategy 3: Global Constraint-Aware Scheduling (Explicitly Enforcing HM Caps and Prioritization Rules)
- Constraint addressed
  - HM limits; Priority Handling; interaction with batching and cold-packing.
- What to change
  - Implement a global scheduler that enforces:
    - HM cap: never exceed 10 concurrent HM orders in Packing or QC across the facility.
    - Express priority: ensure Express orders receive fair and predictable access to scarce resources, with upper bounds on preemption risk for Standard orders.
    - Batch integrity: batch release only when the batch can complete within defined window(s) without violating HM limits or causing excessive wait for other orders.
- How it leverages data/analysis
  - Use time-series of HM order arrivals and resource utilization to set dynamic caps and safe windows.
  - Analytics identify “hot times” when HM risk is mounting; implement load-shedding or rerouting of riskier HM orders to alternative resources if possible.
- Expected outcomes
  - Compliance with hazardous-material limits with more stable flow.
  - Reduced random spikes in variability caused by HM batches and express preemption.
  - Improved predictability for downstream steps (QC, Shipping Label Gen) and fewer cascading delays.
- Practical notes
  - Requires cross-functional policy and potential minor operational changes (e.g., slight re-routing or timing constraints).
  - Build in guardrails to prevent starvation of Standard orders.

Strategy 4 (optional win): Capacity Adjustment and Process Decoupling (when feasible)
- Constraint addressed
  - Shared Cold-Packing; HM concurrency; batching pressure.
- What to change
  - Expand Cold-Packing capacity for peak periods (temporary or permanent) such as adding temporary stations or reassigning space to Cold-Packing lines.
  - Introduce decoupling points to parallelize steps (e.g., allow Shipping Label Gen to proceed in parallel with Packing when feasible, forming partially complete batches that can be closed later).
- How it leverages data/analysis
  - Use peak-hour analyses from the log to identify when capacity shortfalls drive delays; simulate effects of adding stations using DES/Discrete-Event Simulation.
- Expected outcomes
  - Higher throughput, lower waiting times for cold-packing, and better batch formation pace.
- Practical notes
  - Capital-intensive; requires cost-benefit validation.

Notes on selection and tailoring
- Start with Strategy 1 (Dynamic Cold-Packing with preemption) and Strategy 2 (Dynamic Batching) as they directly tackle the core instance-spanning constraints and have high potential impact with moderate changes.
- Strategy 3 (Global Constraint Scheduling) provides a governance layer to ensure the changes do not create new violations or unacceptable side-effects.
- Strategy 4 is a longer-term option to be evaluated based on cost and physical constraints.

Data and tooling recommendations
- Data preparation
  - Ensure logs are clean, with consistent timestamps and clearly labeled resources (including whether a resource is a Cold-Packing station).
  - Create derived attributes: is_cold_packing_required, is_hazardous, batch_id (if present), region, order_type.
- Process mining techniques
  - Process discovery with Inductive Miner or similar to understand the baseline flow and identify bottlenecks.
  - Resource-constrained process mining to visualize contention (which orders waited for which resources and why).
  - Conformance checking to quantify deviations from expected flows due to constraints.
  - Multi-entity process mining or “artifact-centric” views to capture cross-order dependencies and batch contexts.
  - Causal/impact analysis (e.g., cross-correlation, Granger causality) on time-series of waiting times and constraint indicators to quantify interactions.
- Analytics and modeling
  - DES (Discrete-Event Simulation) or agent-based models to test strategies before implementation.
  - Predictive models to forecast short-term demand for Cold-Packing and HM-constraint windows.
  - Optimization/heuristics for dynamic batching (MILP or rolling-horizon heuristics).

4) Simulation and Validation

Objective
- Validate proposed strategies in a risk-free environment before deployment, ensuring improvements in KPIs while respecting instance-spanning constraints.

What to simulate
- A detailed discrete-event simulation that includes:
  - Resources: all packing lines, Cold-Packing stations, QC staff, shipping label systems, and batch-release mechanism.
  - Tasks: Item Picking, Packing (Standard/Cold-Packing), QC, Shipping Label Gen.
  - Constraints: HM cap (max 10 in Packing/QC simultaneously), batch formation/release logic, Express preemption rules, and regional batching rules.
  - Arrival processes: reflect historical demand patterns with peak periods and anomalous days.
  - Interventions: the three strategies (1–3) plus optional capacity changes (Strategy 4).
- Performance metrics to monitor in simulation
  - End-to-end lead time, on-time delivery rate, and order throughput.
  - Resource utilization for Cold-Packing, Packing, and QC.
  - Batch formation time, batch size distribution, and batch release delay.
  - HM constraint violations (should be zero) and HM-order waiting times.
  - Express SLA attainment and the degree of standard-order preemption.

How to execute
- Calibrate the base model with three months of historical logs.
- Implement the proposed strategies as configurable policy modules in the simulator (e.g., parameterize preemption thresholds, batch formation triggers, HM thresholds).
- Run multiple replications across different demand scenarios (normal, peak, and anomaly days).
- Compare KPIs against a baseline scenario (current policies) and perform sensitivity analyses to identify robust settings.
- Validate with pilot rollout in a controlled environment or a limited time window in production, if feasible.

5) Monitoring Post-Implementation

KPIs and dashboards to sustain improvements

A. Instance-spanning constraint indicators
- Cold-Packing
  - Average wait time for cold-packing by order type (Requires Cold Packing vs Not).
  - Cold-Packing station utilization and queue lengths by station.
  - Time-to-pack after prior step for Cold-Packing orders; percentage of orders that waited for Cold-Packing.
- Batching
  - Batch formation and release times by region; batch size distribution; proportion of orders delivered within batch SLA windows.
  - Region-level batch wait time and batch-related delays.
- Priority Handling
  - Express preemption events per resource; average preemption duration; impact on Standard lead times; Express SLA compliance rate.
- HM Limits
  - HM concurrency over time; violations by time window; HM-related wait times; HM queue lengths; compliance rate across the day/peak periods.

B. End-to-end performance KPIs
- Order lead time distribution (median, 90th percentile, 95th percentile).
- On-time delivery rate; percent of orders meeting promised delivery times.
- Throughput (orders per hour) and bottleneck-specific throughput (e.g., per region, per packing line).
- Resource utilization per type (overall and per constraint).

C. Process mining dashboards
- Fitness, precision, and generalization metrics to assess conformance of the real process to the designed model after policy changes.
- Wait-time by cause: breakdown of waiting time into causes (resource contention, batching, preemption, HM limits).
- Time-series heatmaps for resource contention and batch-related delays across shifts and days.
- Cross-correlation heatmaps showing interaction effects between constraints (e.g., Express arrivals vs Cold-Packing utilization vs HM concurrency).

D. Monitoring cadence and governance
- Real-time alerts if a constraint is breaching acceptable thresholds (e.g., HM cap violations, excessive express preemption, long batch formation delays).
- Periodic (weekly/monthly) reviews of constraint signatures with an emphasis on trend changes after deployment.
- Iterative refinement: use the latest logs to recalibrate models, adjust policy parameters (e.g., preemption thresholds, batch triggers), and plan capacity adjustments if needed.

Operationalizing the strategy
- Start with a data-driven pilot: implement Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 in a controlled environment (e.g., one region or one shift) to observe gains and unintended consequences.
- Establish governance and change management: define who can adjust preemption rules, batch triggers, and HM thresholds; document decision rules.
- Plan for scale: ensure that the WMS/ERP and scheduling systems can support dynamic queues, per-resource prioritization, and batch management logic.
- Maintain data integrity: ensure consistent timestamps, resource identifiers, and batch IDs across all systems to enable ongoing process mining and monitoring.

In summary
- Using process mining to identify and quantify instance-spanning constraints provides precise, data-driven visibility into how Shared Cold-Packing, Shipping Batching, Priority Handling, and HM Limits cause waiting and delays across orders.
- Understanding interactions among constraints is critical to avoid suboptimal improvements when changing one policy in isolation.
- Three concrete, constraint-aware strategies (dynamic cold-packing scheduling, dynamic batching with hazard-aware release, and global constraint scheduling) provide practical, data-informed paths to improve throughput, reduce end-to-end times, and maintain regulatory compliance during peak periods.
- Simulation and validation enable testing of these strategies before deployment, ensuring improvements hold under real-world variability.
- Ongoing monitoring with process-mining dashboards keeps the focus on the instance-spanning constraints and their evolving impact, supporting continuous improvement and rapid adjustments as demand patterns shift.
