### Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

#### Case 1:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** None
- **Explanation:** This case follows the normative process exactly as described for a scenario where inventory is sufficient. The sequence adheres to the expected flow: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close.

#### Case 2:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** The "Package items" activity occurs before "Authorize payment."
- **Explanation:** According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items." This sequence violates the rule that payment authorization must precede packaging.

#### Case 3:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** The "Ship order" activity occurs after "Cancel order."
- **Explanation:** The normative process states that once an order is canceled, it should not proceed with activities intended for fulfillment, such as shipping. This sequence violates the rule that "Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation.

#### Case 4:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
- **Violation:** None
- **Explanation:** This case follows the normative process exactly as described for a scenario where inventory is insufficient. The sequence adheres to the expected flow: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.

#### Case 5:
- **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation:** The "Ship order" activity occurs before "Package items."
- **Explanation:** According to the normative process, "Package items" should occur before "Ship order." This sequence violates the rule that items must be prepared before they can be shipped.

### Summary of Violations

- **Case 3:** Violation of the rule that "Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation.
