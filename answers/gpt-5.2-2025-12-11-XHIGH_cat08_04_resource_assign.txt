## 1) Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1 Prepare the event log for resource analytics (so results are trustworthy)
Before mining, I would standardize/enrich the log so that resource conclusions don’t get skewed by data quirks:

- **Lifecycle alignment**: ensure `START/COMPLETE` semantics are consistent (e.g., “Work L1 Start/End” vs “Assign L1”).  
- **Derive key time segments** per ticket and tier:
  - *Assignment delay*: `Assign (tier)`  `Work (tier) Start`
  - *Touch time*: `Work Start`  `Work End` (sum if multiple work intervals)
  - *Post-work delay*: `Work End`  next event (often escalation/assign/resolve)
- **Normalize resources** (Agent IDs), tiers, and skills (map synonyms like `DB-SQL` vs `Database-SQL`).
- **Create derived indicators** for later analysis:
  - `#reassignments`, `#handovers`, `#escalations`, `first_assignee_skill_match`, `tier_path` (e.g., L1L2L2L3), `SLA_breached` by priority.

This gives clean “time-in-queue vs time-working” and “who touched it and why” analytics—critical for resource assignment optimization.

---

### 1.2 Metrics to analyze agents and tiers (what I would measure)
**Workload & distribution**
- Tickets handled per agent / per tier (daily/weekly).
- **WIP (Work-In-Process)** per agent: average #tickets simultaneously “assigned but not completed”.
- **Workload inequality**: e.g., Gini coefficient or top-10% agents handling X% of volume.

**Speed & delays**
- Median / P75 / P90 of:
  - assignment delay (queue time) by tier/skill/agent
  - touch time by tier/skill/agent
  - end-to-end resolution time by priority/category/required skill
- “Time to first human touch” from creation to first `Work Start`.

**Quality & effectiveness**
- **L1 First-Call Resolution (FCR)**: % tickets with no escalation beyond L1.
  - Break down by category/required skill/agent to identify where L1 can realistically resolve.
- Reopen/rework rates (if available): % tickets reopened after resolution by agent/tier.

**Routing correctness**
- **Skill match rate**: % cases where the first working agent (or first assignee) had the `Required Skill` in their skill profile.
- **Tier fit rate**: how often tickets are worked at a tier higher than necessary (more on this under skill utilization).

---

### 1.3 Process mining techniques to reveal *actual* assignment behavior (vs intended)
Your “intended” logic is roughly: *round-robin within tier + manual escalation to correct skill/tier*. Process mining will show what is *actually happening*:

**A) Organizational / resource mining**
- **Role discovery (clustering)**: infer roles from behavior (activities performed + ticket types handled).  
  - Example outcome: some “L1” agents are effectively doing “L2-type” work (or vice versa), or dispatchers behave differently (some do skill-based assignment, others don’t).
- Compare discovered roles to the official tier structure to detect “shadow operations.”

**B) Handover-of-work / social network analysis**
Build a **handover network** where an edge AB exists if B works a ticket after A. Key insights:
- Which agents/teams are the *main sinks* of escalations.
- Where **handover loops** occur (ABCB), usually caused by skill mismatch or unclear ownership.
- **Betweenness centrality** identifies agents acting as bottleneck “gatekeepers” (often unintentionally).

**C) Resource-pattern conformance checking**
Translate intended routing rules into checks, for example:
- “If Required Skill = Networking-Firewall, then assigned L2 must have that skill”
- “P1/P2 must have assignment delay < X minutes”
- “Tickets should not bounce across >N agents”
Then compute:
- % compliant vs non-compliant
- where violations cluster (certain dispatchers, shifts, categories, or skills)

This explicitly quantifies “the system does round-robin” versus “the system *actually* routes certain categories to a few overloaded specialists.”

---

### 1.4 Skill utilization analysis (are skills used effectively?)
I’d treat **skills as a capacity pool** and analyze demand vs supply:

**Demand by skill**
- Volume of tickets by `Required Skill` (and by time-of-day/day-of-week).
- SLA breach rate and queue time by required skill.

**Supply by skill**
- Count of agents who truly have the skill (and at what tier).
- If you have proficiency levels, include them; otherwise infer proficiency proxies:
  - shorter touch time + low reassign/reopen for that skill
  - consistent resolution within SLA when they handle that skill

**Utilization / effectiveness**
- For each skill:
  - % handled by qualified agents (skill match rate)
  - average queue delay until a qualified agent starts
  - reassignments triggered by “needs different skill” notes

**Overqualification / misallocation**
Specialists spending time on work “below their skill level” can be measured by:
- Define a **“tier-needed” baseline** from history: for each (category, required skill, priority), compute the *lowest tier that resolved it successfully within SLA* most often.
- Compare actual tier used vs tier-needed:
  - L2/L3 working tickets with a high historical L1 success rate = “shift-left opportunity”
- Also detect cases where L2 performs “L1 activities” (password reset / basic troubleshooting) by role discovery + activity frequency.

---

## 2) Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues (and quantifying impact)

### 2.1 Bottlenecks from insufficient skill availability
For each `Required Skill`, compute:
- **Queue time**: `Assign L2/L3`  `Work Start`
- **Backlog**: #tickets waiting for that skill at each point in time
- **Capacity proxy**: total touch time delivered by qualified agents per day vs incoming demand

Flag skills where:
- P75/P90 queue time is high
- SLA breach rate is high
- backlog grows during specific windows (e.g., patch Tuesdays, month-end, after-hours)

This typically exposes a small set of “constraint skills” (e.g., Firewall, IAM, DB) driving most P2/P3 breaches.

---

### 2.2 Delays introduced by reassignments and escalations
Quantify reassignment cost using throughput decomposition:

- For each reassignment event:
  - **Reassignment delay** = `Reassign timestamp`  next `Work Start`
  - plus any “lost work” if work was done by wrong agent before reassignment

Key metrics:
- Average and P90 delay per reassignment
- % tickets with 1 reassignment (by priority/category/required skill)
- “Bounce rate” within tier (L2L2 reassign) vs cross-tier (L2L3)

You can also compute **avoidable reassignment candidates**:
- reassignment occurs within X minutes of work start (suggesting immediate skill mismatch)
- reassignment reason notes like “needs different skill” / “wrong queue”

---

### 2.3 Impact of incorrect initial assignments (L1/dispatcher)
Define “incorrect initial assignment” operationally, e.g.:
- first assignee lacks the required skill OR
- ticket is reassigned/escalated within a short window OR
- ticket follows a high-risk pattern (L1L2 then L2 reassign due to skill mismatch)

Quantify:
- % of tickets with initial skill mismatch
- average extra cycle time attributable to mismatch (difference between matched vs mismatched cohorts)
- how often mismatch is linked to specific categories, channels (phone vs portal), or dispatchers

---

### 2.4 Identify overloaded vs underutilized agents/teams
Using agent-level metrics:
- Average WIP, assignment delay for tickets assigned to them, and their own touch time
- Utilization proxy = touch time / available time (if shift calendar exists)
- SLA breach contribution: % of breached tickets where agent was on critical path

Common patterns process mining reveals:
- “Hero agents” receiving most escalations (high centrality), creating a single-point bottleneck
- Underutilized agents with the *right* skill but not being routed work (skill data not used, or routing biased)

---

### 2.5 Correlate assignment patterns with SLA breaches (quantify drivers)
Build a **case-level dataset** from the log and run statistical/ML analysis:

Target:
- `SLA_breached` (binary) or lateness in minutes (continuous)

Features (examples):
- priority, category, required skill
- initial skill match (Y/N)
- #reassignments, #handovers, #escalations
- total queue time at each tier
- time-of-day/day-of-week, channel
- which dispatcher/assignment rule applied (if logged)

Outputs you want:
- Effect sizes like:
  - “Each reassignment increases breach odds by X%”
  - “Skill mismatch on first assignment adds median +Y hours”
- Attribution:
  - “Z% of P2 breaches have at least one skill mismatch”
  - “Top 3 required skills account for Q% of breach minutes”

This ties resource assignment behavior directly to SLA outcomes, avoiding anecdotal conclusions.

---

## 3) Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Likely root causes (and how the log can confirm them)
**A) Round-robin ignoring skills and workload**
Evidence in logs:
- low skill match rate on first assignment
- high L2 reassign rate with “needs different skill”
- overloaded specialists while other qualified agents idle
- dispatcher assignment bias (some agents get disproportionate share)

**B) Inaccurate/incomplete skill profiles**
Evidence:
- agents repeatedly resolve tickets requiring a skill not in their profile (hidden skills)
- agents assigned tickets “matching” their profile but repeatedly reassign/struggle (stale skills)
- high variance in touch time and rework for same skill among “qualified” agents

**C) Poor ticket categorization / wrong required-skill identification**
Evidence:
- frequent mid-stream change of `Required Skill` (like your snippet: App-CRM  Database-SQL)
- high reassignment after L2 start
- strong dependence on channel (portal forms vs phone) suggesting intake quality differences

**D) Lack of real-time workload visibility**
Evidence:
- assignment delay spikes during certain windows despite available qualified capacity (routing not workload-aware)
- some agents accumulate high WIP while others remain low

**E) L1 training/empowerment gaps (excessive escalations)**
Evidence:
- very low FCR for specific categories that *could* be resolved at L1 (based on historical successful L1 resolutions)
- large share of escalations without meaningful work time at L1 (“pass-through” behavior)

---

### 3.2 Variant analysis: “smooth” vs “problematic” cases
Cluster tickets into variants such as:
- **Happy path**: Created  Assign L1  Work L1  Resolved  
- **Normal escalation**: L1  L2  Resolved  
- **Problematic**: L1  L2  Reassign (L2)  L2  (maybe L3)  Resolved  
- **Churn**: multiple L2 reassignments / tier bouncing

Then compare these cohorts on:
- required skill, category, channel
- dispatcher involved
- shift/time-of-day
- initial skill match
- queue time components

This surfaces patterns like “Database-SQL tickets on weekends have 3× reassignment rate” or “Portal-created Network tickets get misclassified more often.”

---

### 3.3 Decision mining: why assignments/escalations happen
At decision points (e.g., “Assign L2 to which agent?” “Escalate or not?”), use decision mining:
- Train an interpretable model (decision tree / rule list) using available attributes at decision time:
  - priority/category/keywords, current backlog, agent workload, skills, dispatcher
- Compare:
  - **Discovered decision logic** (actual behavior)
  - **Prescribed logic** (intended rules)

Typical findings:
- Dispatchers subconsciously route to “known experts” rather than distributing to all qualified agents.
- Certain categories always go to L2 regardless of L1 resolvability.
- Assignments correlate more with “who is online” than “who is best fit,” causing queue imbalance.

---

## 4) Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies (concrete, actionable)

Below are **five** strategies (you asked for 3). Each is implementable using insights from the mined log.

---

### Strategy 1 — Skill-based, “first-time-right” routing (with proficiency weighting)
**Issue addressed:** skill mismatch, reassignments, long L2 queues caused by misrouting.

**How it uses process mining insights**
- Use mined **skill match rate**, reassignment reasons, and successful resolution history to build:
  - skill-to-ticket mapping (actual required skills per category/keyword pattern)
  - proficiency scores per agent/skill (from outcomes: speed, SLA success, low rework)

**Assignment logic**
- For each incoming ticket:
  1) determine required skill (from category + predictive model; see Strategy 3)
  2) select from agents who have the skill
  3) choose based on a score, e.g.:  
     `Score = proficiency(skill) – *(current_WIP) – *(expected_queue_delay) + *(SLA_urgency)`

**Data required**
- agent skill matrix (and ideally proficiency)
- event log-derived performance by skill
- real-time WIP/availability

**Expected benefits**
- fewer L2/L3 reassignments
- reduced “assign  work start” delay for constrained skills
- higher SLA compliance due to reduced churn and better routing accuracy

---

### Strategy 2 — Workload- and SLA-aware dispatching (replace pure round-robin)
**Issue addressed:** uneven workload, overloaded experts, underutilized agents, SLA breaches due to queueing.

**How it uses process mining insights**
- Use mined queue-time distributions by skill/tier and WIP patterns to calibrate thresholds and balancing rules.

**Assignment logic**
- Assign to the **least-loaded qualified agent**, with guardrails:
  - cap per-agent WIP (WIP limits)
  - prioritize by SLA urgency (time-to-breach)
  - avoid assigning to an agent already causing long assignment delays (indicator of overload)

**Data required**
- real-time assignments (current backlog per agent)
- calendars/shifts (availability)
- SLA due timestamps and priority rules

**Expected benefits**
- smoother load distribution
- lower waiting time between assignment and work start
- fewer “silent queues” where tickets sit assigned but untouched

---

### Strategy 3 — Predictive triage: auto-detect required skill + “L1 resolvability”
**Issue addressed:** wrong categorization/required skill, unnecessary escalations, pass-through L1 handling.

**How it uses process mining insights**
- From historical tickets, learn:
  - which keywords/categories lead to which *actual* skills (based on who ultimately resolved)
  - probability that L1 can resolve (FCR likelihood model)

**Implementation**
- NLP model on ticket description + metadata outputs:
  1) predicted required skill (top-3 with confidence)
  2) predicted tier needed (or “L1 likely resolvable” probability)

**Routing policy examples**
- If `P(L1 resolves) > 0.7`  route to L1 + suggest best KB script
- If `P(L1 resolves) < 0.2` and priority is P2  route directly to L2 specialist queue (avoid L1 delay)
- If model confidence is low  send to dispatcher with recommended skill candidates (decision support)

**Data required**
- ticket text/description (or structured symptom codes)
- resolution outcomes (who resolved, final required skill)
- historical escalations/reassignments

**Expected benefits**
- fewer misroutes and mid-stream skill changes
- reduced time-to-right-resource
- improved P2/P3 SLA through bypassing low-value steps for complex tickets

---

### Strategy 4 — Escalation & reassignment governance (“stop the bounce”)
**Issue addressed:** frequent reassignments, unclear ownership, avoidable escalations.

**How it uses process mining insights**
- Identify top reassignment triggers and the exact process points where churn starts (often right after L2 start).

**Controls to implement**
- Require **structured reassignment reason codes** (skill mismatch, queue error, missing info, etc.)
- Introduce **pre-escalation checklist** at L1:
  - required fields complete, troubleshooting steps logged, correct category selected
- Add a **“virtual swarm”** step:
  - L1 can consult L2 via chat for 5 minutes before full escalation
- Enforce **reassignment limits** (e.g., >2 triggers mandatory dispatcher review)

**Data required**
- event log + standardized reason codes
- KB usage and troubleshooting checklist completion flags (if available)

**Expected benefits**
- immediate reduction in reassignment loops
- better data for ongoing optimization (reasons become measurable)
- improved end-to-end time by preventing churn

---

### Strategy 5 — Skill-capacity planning + shift-left training driven by mined evidence
**Issue addressed:** specialists doing low-level work; L1 escalating too much; skill bottlenecks at certain times.

**How it uses process mining insights**
- Use mined **“tier-needed baseline”** and skill demand peaks to decide:
  - which skills to train into L1 (“shift-left” candidates)
  - which skills require more L2 coverage during certain windows

**Actions**
- Build a **skill demand forecast** (by hour/day/week) from historical arrivals.
- Cross-train L1 on the top 2–3 high-volume, high-delay skills where L1 historically succeeds after training.
- Create a **flex pool**: certain L2 agents spend X% of time supporting L1 backlog during peaks, but only for predefined ticket types.

**Data required**
- time series of incoming tickets by required skill
- success rates by tier/skill
- staffing/shift data

**Expected benefits**
- reduced L2 queue for bottleneck skills
- higher L1 FCR where it’s realistically achievable
- better utilization of L2/L3 (focus on true expert work)

---

## 5) Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1 Use simulation to test strategies before rollout
Use the mined model to run **discrete-event simulation** (or tool-supported “what-if” simulation):

**Inputs (calibrated from the event log)**
- arrival rates by hour/day and by priority/category/required skill
- service time distributions (touch time) by tier/skill/agent group
- routing probabilities (current vs proposed)
- resource calendars (shifts), WIP limits, escalation rules

**Scenarios to simulate**
- Baseline (current routing)
- Skill-based routing only
- Workload-aware routing only
- Predictive triage + direct-to-L2 for low L1-resolvability tickets
- Combined strategy + staffing adjustments for bottleneck skills

**Outputs to compare**
- SLA compliance rate by priority (P2/P3 focus)
- mean and P90 resolution time
- queue time by skill/tier
- reassignment counts
- utilization by agent group (to avoid “fix SLA by overloading everyone”)

This de-risks changes and helps choose the best combination (often the best result is “routing + governance + small staffing shifts,” not routing alone).

---

### 5.2 Post-implementation monitoring with process mining dashboards (continuous control)
Set up dashboards that refresh daily/near-real-time and track:

**Routing correctness & churn**
- First-time-right assignment rate (skill match on first working agent)
- Reassignment rate per required skill, per dispatcher, per tier
- Handover count per ticket (median/P90)
- Top reassignment reasons (from Strategy 4)

**SLA and flow efficiency**
- SLA compliance by priority/category/required skill
- Time-to-first-touch and assignwork-start delay (especially for P2/P3)
- Flow efficiency = touch time / total cycle time (should increase)

**Capacity & utilization**
- WIP per agent and per skill queue
- Utilization by skill group (are bottleneck skills still bottlenecked?)
- Workload balance indicators (distribution spread)

**Process views to keep “always on”**
- Performance overlay on the process map (where time accumulates)
- Skill queue heatmap (required skill × time-of-day)
- Handover network (spot emerging bottlenecks or new “gatekeepers”)
- Conformance view (violations of new routing/escalation rules)

**Governance cadence**
- Weekly ops review: bottleneck skills, reassignment hotspots, SLA drivers
- Monthly improvement cycle: update predictive triage model, refresh proficiency scores, adjust staffing/training plans
- Drift detection: alert when demand shifts (new application rollout, seasonal spikes) change routing needs

---

If you share (even anonymized) the actual event log schema and SLA definitions (e.g., SLA clock start/stop rules, business hours calendars, and what counts as “resolved”), I can propose the exact derived fields, the conformance rules, and a concrete dashboard/KPI specification tailored to TechSolve’s incident process.
