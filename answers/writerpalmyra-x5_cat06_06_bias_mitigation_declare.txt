###  **Explanation: How These Constraints Reduce Bias**

1. **`responded_existence` & `coexistence` with `ManualReview`:**
   - *Why?* If any sensitive attribute (e.g., race, gender, age) is checked, a `ManualReview` must occur in the same trace.
   - *Impact:* Ensures human oversight whenever sensitive data is accessed, reducing algorithmic bias risks.

2. **Response from Sensitive Checks to `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - *Why?* After viewing a sensitive attribute, a formal mitigation step must follow before any decision.
   - *Impact:* Prevents direct influence of sensitive data on decisions by enforcing procedural fairness.

3. **`succession`: Enforce `BiasMitigationCheck` before `FinalDecision`:**
   - *Why?* Ensures no decision (`FinalDecision`) can occur unless preceded by a fairness check.
   - *Impact:* Adds a gatekeeper step, promoting equitable treatment.

4. **`nonsuccession` and `nonchainsuccession`:**
   - *Why?* Forbid immediate transitions from checking sensitive attributes to rejection decisions—even indirect chains.
   - *Impact:* Eliminates both direct and indirect bias pathways (e.g., "see race  reject" or "see race  some step  reject").

5. **`noncoexistence` with `DirectAutoReject`:**
   - *Why?* Ensures fully automated rejections cannot co-occur with access to sensitive attributes.
   - *Impact:* Prevents black-box systems from using protected characteristics in silent filtering.

6. **Use of `_Sensitive` decision variants (e.g., `Approve_Sensitive`, `Reject_Sensitive`):**
   - *Why?* These act as proxy indicators that a sensitive applicant was processed.
   - *Impact:* Allows traceability and auditing—decisions on sensitive cases *must* include review safeguards.

 **Overall Effect:**  
These constraints embed **procedural fairness** into the process model. They don't prevent decisions based on merit but ensure that such decisions are **reviewed, justified, and isolated** from direct or indirect misuse of sensitive attributes. This aligns with anti-discrimination principles in automated decision-making (e.g., GDPR, AI Act, and fair lending laws).
