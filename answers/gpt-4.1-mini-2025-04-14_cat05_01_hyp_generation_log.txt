### Identified Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

1. **Out-of-Order Activities (Sequence Violations)**
   - Case 1002 and 1003 show activities that do not follow the normal process flow:
     - In case 1002, "Confirm Shipment" and "Ship Goods" happen before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock."
     - In case 1003, "Ship Goods" occurs before "Confirm Shipment."
   - These deviations could indicate system processing errors, process compliance violations, or intentional shortcuts (e.g., priority shipping or rush orders).

2. **Missing or Early Activities**
   - Case 1004 shows "Receive Payment" occurring before "Issue Invoice" and other supply chain activities.
   - Early receipt of payment could be a legitimate pre-payment scenario, but it is unusual and should be verified.
   - Missing activities or wrong orders may indicate data entry errors or missing event logging.

3. **Repeated or Suspicious Events**
   - Cases show "Confirm Shipment" sometimes before "Validate Stock" or much earlier than expected. This might reflect logistics trying to confirm shipments prematurely ("attempted_early=Y").
   - Such behavior suggests possible miscommunication between departments or incorrect process execution.

4. **Late or Delayed Activities**
   - Case 1003 logs "Confirm Shipment" after "Issue Invoice" and after "Ship Goods," noted as `late_confirmation=Y`. Late confirmation might cause downstream process delays, affecting customer satisfaction.

5. **Resource Role and Department Mismatches**
   - Checking if activities are performed by correct roles is crucial; for instance:
     - "Perform Credit Check" should be done by Finance (CreditOfficer).
     - "Register Order" by Sales.
     - "Validate Stock" and "Ship Goods" by Logistics.
   - Mismatches could indicate lack of training, fraud, or role confusion.

### Hypotheses on Causes

- **Process or System Configuration Issues:** Process engine or workflow system might not enforce strict activity sequencing.
- **Human Error:** Staff might not be following intended process steps or might be inputting records out of sequence.
- **Policy Violations / Exceptions:** Some orders might be deliberately fast-tracked or handled differently (especially priority orders).
- **Data Capture Problems:** Event logging timestamps could be inaccurate or events could be recorded late.
- **Resource Allocation Problems:** Roles might be misassigned or overloaded, causing out-of-sequence event executions.

### Relevant SQL Queries for Further Investigation

#### 1. Find Orders with Out-of-Sequence Events vs. the Defined Process

Check if activities happen out of the normal order (e.g., "Ship Goods" before "Confirm Shipment" or "Perform Credit Check"):

```sql
WITH event_order AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    MIN(timestamp) AS first_occurrence
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id, activity
),

normal_flow AS (
  SELECT *, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY activity_order) AS expected_sequence
  FROM (
    VALUES
      ('Register Order', 1),
      ('Perform Credit Check', 2),
      ('Validate Stock', 3),
      ('Confirm Shipment', 4),
      ('Ship Goods', 5),
      ('Issue Invoice', 6),
      ('Receive Payment', 7)
  ) AS t(activity, activity_order)
),

case_activity_sequence AS (
  SELECT
    e.case_id,
    e.activity,
    nf.expected_sequence,
    e.first_occurrence
  FROM event_order e
  JOIN normal_flow nf ON e.activity = nf.activity
)

SELECT 
  c1.case_id,
  c1.activity AS activity_1,
  c2.activity AS activity_2,
  c1.first_occurrence AS time_1,
  c2.first_occurrence AS time_2
FROM case_activity_sequence c1
JOIN case_activity_sequence c2 
  ON c1.case_id = c2.case_id
  AND c1.expected_sequence < c2.expected_sequence
WHERE c1.first_occurrence > c2.first_occurrence
ORDER BY c1.case_id, c1.expected_sequence;
```

_This query identifies pairs of events occurring in the wrong order relative to the normal process._

---

#### 2. Detect Activities Executed by Unexpected Roles or Departments

Check if activities are handled by proper resource roles or departments, e.g., "Perform Credit Check" should only be done by Credit Analyst in Finance:

```sql
SELECT 
  oel.case_id,
  oel.event_id,
  oel.activity,
  oel.resource,
  r.role,
  r.department
FROM order_event_log oel
LEFT JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE 
  (oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND (r.role IS NULL OR r.role NOT IN ('Credit Analyst')))
  OR (oel.activity = 'Register Order' AND (r.role IS NULL OR r.role NOT IN ('Sales Executive')))
  OR (oel.activity IN ('Validate Stock', 'Ship Goods') AND (r.role IS NULL OR r.department <> 'Logistics'))
  OR (oel.activity IN ('Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment') AND (r.department <> 'Finance'));
```

_This reveals potential resource misassignment for critical activities._

---

#### 3. List Orders with Early Receipt of Payment (Payment Before Invoice or Other Activities)

```sql
WITH events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    MIN(timestamp) AS ts
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity IN ('Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment')
  GROUP BY case_id, activity
)

SELECT 
  p.case_id,
  p.ts AS payment_time,
  i.ts AS invoice_time
FROM events p
LEFT JOIN events i ON p.case_id = i.case_id AND i.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
WHERE p.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND (i.ts IS NULL OR p.ts < i.ts)
ORDER BY p.ts;
```

_This query identifies cases where payment is received before invoice issuance or without invoice._

---

#### 4. Identify Orders with Missing Key Activities

To find cases missing critical steps like "Perform Credit Check," "Validate Stock," or "Confirm Shipment":

```sql
WITH activities AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id, activity
  FROM order_event_log
)

SELECT o.case_id
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN activities a1 ON o.case_id = a1.case_id AND a1.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
LEFT JOIN activities a2 ON o.case_id = a2.case_id AND a2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
LEFT JOIN activities a3 ON o.case_id = a3.case_id AND a3.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
WHERE a1.activity IS NULL OR a2.activity IS NULL OR a3.activity IS NULL;
```

_This detects cases with missing essential process steps._

---

#### 5. Analyze Time Between Process Steps for Delays or Suspicious Timing

For example, time difference between "Register Order" and "Perform Credit Check":

```sql
WITH timepoints AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    MIN(timestamp) AS ts
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity IN ('Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check')
  GROUP BY case_id, activity
)

SELECT
  t1.case_id,
  t1.ts AS register_order_time,
  t2.ts AS credit_check_time,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (t2.ts - t1.ts))/60 AS minutes_diff
FROM timepoints t1
JOIN timepoints t2 ON t1.case_id = t2.case_id
WHERE t1.activity = 'Register Order' AND t2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
ORDER BY minutes_diff DESC;
```

_Large or negative time differences indicate delays or incorrect timestamps._

---

#### 6. Examine Early "Confirm Shipment" or "Ship Goods" Activities

Orders where these logistics activities happen significantly earlier than Finance approval or credit checks:

```sql
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    MIN(timestamp) AS ts
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id, activity
)

SELECT
  c.case_id,
  c.ts AS confirm_shipment_time,
  p.ts AS perform_credit_check_time,
  v.ts AS validate_stock_time
FROM event_times c
LEFT JOIN event_times p ON c.case_id = p.case_id AND p.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
LEFT JOIN event_times v ON c.case_id = v.case_id AND v.activity = 'Validate Stock'
WHERE c.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND (c.ts < COALESCE(p.ts, TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31') 
       OR c.ts < COALESCE(v.ts, TIMESTAMP '9999-12-31'))
ORDER BY c.case_id;
```

_This highlights logistics actions occurring before critical financial or stock validation steps._

### Summary

By running these queries, you can:

- Identify process flow deviations and time anomalies.
- Detect role and department mismatches.
- Find missing mandatory activities.
- Understand timing and ordering irregularities that may affect process quality or compliance.
- Drill down to specific cases and resources responsible to improve training, system configuration, or procedural enforcement.

These investigations should reveal whether anomalies are due to human errors, system flaws, policy exceptions, or possible fraud.
