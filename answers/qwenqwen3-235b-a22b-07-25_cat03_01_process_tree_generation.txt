We are tasked with modeling a **complex hospital patient management process** as a **Process Tree** using the defined operators:

- `->` (sequence)
- `X` (exclusive choice)
- `+` (true concurrency / parallel)
- `*` (loop: A is executed once, then optionally B and repeat A)

We will build this process tree **step by step**, following the logical flow of the process, and then construct the corresponding `pm4py`-style `ProcessTree` object structure.

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **1. Initial Sequential Flow**
- A  RG  IA  TI  TC

So far:  
`->(A, ->(RG, ->(IA, ->(TI, TC))))`

#### **2. Triage-Based Diagnostic Test (Exclusive Choice)**
After TC, choose **either CE or FBP**:
- `X(CE, FBP)`

So now:  
`->(A, RG, IA, TI, TC, X(CE, FBP))`  
(We'll keep nesting properly in the tree.)

#### **3. Loop on Abnormal Results**
After the initial diagnostic test (CE or FBP), we evaluate results. If abnormal, enter a **loop**:
- Loop body:
  - SC
  - Then: X(TM, SPT)  treatment choice
  - Then: RDT  which is X(FCE, FBA) (follow-up test)

So loop structure:  
`*( initial_test_result_evaluation, ->(SC, X(TM, SPT), X(FCE, FBA)) )`  
But note: the **loop operator** `*(A, B)` means:
- Execute A (mandatory)
- Then **optionally** execute B and go back to A (repeating until exit)

However, in our case:
- The **first diagnostic test (CE/FBP)** is **not repeated** — it's only done once.
- The **loop starts after the initial test**, and repeats:
  - SC
  - X(TM, SPT)
  - X(FCE, FBA)  this is the **re-diagnostic test**

But the loop **condition** is based on the **result of the diagnostic test** (initial or re-test). So how do we model this?

We interpret the loop as:
- After the **first diagnostic test (CE or FBP)**, we check results.
- If **normal**, skip the loop.
- If **abnormal**, enter a loop where:
  - You do SC
  - Then X(TM, SPT)
  - Then a **follow-up test**: X(FCE, FBA)
  - Then **check result again**: if abnormal  repeat loop

So the **loop body** is:  
`->(SC, X(TM, SPT), X(FCE, FBA))`

But the **loop operator** `*(A, B)` runs A once, then optionally runs B and repeats A. But here, **A is the first execution of the test**, which is **not inside the loop**.

Wait — this is **not a standard loop** in the `*(A,B)` form.

Let’s re-analyze the `*` operator:

> `*(A, B)` means: execute A, then either exit, or execute B and then A again (possibly multiple times).

So to model a loop that repeats **after** the first execution, we can structure it as:

- `*( InitialDiagnostic, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), ReDiagnostic) )`

But that would **repeat the initial diagnostic** — which is wrong.

Alternatively, we must **not** include the first test in the loop.

So we need to model:
- First: do `X(CE, FBP)`
- Then: check result — if abnormal, enter loop: repeat `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` until normal

But the `*` operator **requires** that the **first execution of A** is inside the loop.

Hence, we must **reframe** the process.

Idea: Let’s consider the **loop to start with the specialist consultation**, and the **first diagnostic test is separate**.

But the problem says: "if the results are abnormal, a loop commences".

So the **loop is not around the first test**, but **starts after**.

So we can model this as:

- After `X(CE, FBP)`, we have a **conditional loop** on the result.
- But process trees **do not have explicit conditions** — only structural logic.

So we model the **loop as**:

`*( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

But what is `tau`? A silent step.

But the `*` operator expects the **first execution of A**, then optionally B and repeat.

We want:
- First, do `X(CE, FBP)` — outside loop
- Then, **if needed**, do `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` multiple times

But this is **not directly expressible** with `*(A,B)` unless we include the **first diagnostic** in the loop.

Alternative interpretation (common in process trees):

We model the **entire diagnostic-evaluation-treatment cycle** as:

`*( X(CE, FBP), ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

But this would mean:
- First: do `X(CE, FBP)`
- Then: optionally do `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` and go back to `X(CE, FBP)` again

But that **repeats the initial test**, which is **not desired**.

Wait — actually, the **follow-up test** is `X(FCE,FBA)`, which is different from the initial `X(CE,FBP)`.

But in the loop, after treatment, we do `X(FCE,FBA)` — not `X(CE,FBP)`.

So we cannot use `*( X(CE,FBP), ... )` because the loop repeats with a **different** test.

Hence, the only way is to model the **loop as starting with SC**, and the **first diagnostic is outside**.

But the `*` operator requires the **first execution** of the loop body to be in A.

So we can do:

Let A = `tau` (silent step), B = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`

Then `*(tau, B)` means: do tau (nothing), then optionally do B and repeat.

But then the **first execution of B is not forced** — but we need to **enter the loop only if results are abnormal**.

But in the process, **if the initial test is abnormal**, we **must** do SC  treatment  re-test.

So the **loop body must be executed at least once** if abnormal.

But `*(A,B)` executes A once, then optionally B and repeat.

So if we set A = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`, and B = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`, then:

`*( A, A )`  executes A once, then optionally A again.

That is: **at least once**, and then repeats while condition holds.

But the condition is not structural — it's based on test results.

In process trees, **we assume that the loop exits when the re-diagnostic test yields normal results** — so the **structure allows repetition**, and the **exit is modeled by not taking the B branch**.

So we can model the loop as:

`*( ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)), ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

But that’s redundant.

Alternatively, define:

Let `LoopBody = ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`

Then `*( tau, LoopBody )` — but then **LoopBody is not executed unless we take the B branch**, meaning **zero or more times**, not **one or more**.

But we need **one or more times** if initial test is abnormal.

So to model **"execute at least once if abnormal"**, we cannot do it purely structurally — unless we **move the first diagnostic into the loop**.

Wait — perhaps we **misunderstand** the loop.

Re-reading:

> "Once the initial diagnostic test is done, the results must be evaluated. If the results are abnormal, a loop commences: ..."

So:
- Initial test: done once
- Then, if abnormal: enter loop that repeats SC  treatment  re-test until normal

So the **loop includes**:
- SC
- X(TM,SPT)
- RDT = X(FCE,FBA)

And repeats **this entire block** as long as results are abnormal.

But the **first execution** of this block is **mandatory** if initial test is abnormal.

So we need: **zero or more** iterations of the loop **after the first execution**.

But the `*` operator does **one A**, then **optional B and repeat A**.

So if we set:
- A = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`   first execution
- B = `tau` (or identity) — but we need to repeat the same block

Wait — no: `*(A, B)` means: do A, then either stop or do B and go back to A.

So if we want to repeat the **same block**, we set B = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`

But then A is executed once, then B is executed and then A again — so A is executed **multiple times**.

But we want the **same block** to repeat.

So we can set:
- A = `tau`
- B = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`

Then `*(tau, B)` = zero or more executions of B.

But we need **at least one** if abnormal.

So we must do:

After initial test:
- If abnormal: do `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` and then **loop** with `*(tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)))` — but we can't branch based on data.

**Conclusion**: In process trees, we **cannot model data-based conditions**. We must use **structural choices**.

The standard way to model a loop that runs **one or more times** is to use:

`->( FirstExecution, *(tau, RepeatBody) )`

But here, the **decision to enter** the loop is based on data.

But in absence of guards, we model the **possibility** of the loop.

So the best we can do is:

After the initial test, we have a **loop** that can run **zero or more times**, but in reality, it runs **only if abnormal**.

But the process says: "if results are abnormal, a loop commences" — so the **first SC is mandatory** in that case.

But since we can't model the condition, we **must assume** that the loop `*(A,B)` captures the **possibility of repetition**.

A better interpretation:

Let the **entire diagnostic-evaluation-treatment cycle** be modeled as:

`*( X(CE, FBP), ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

But this would repeat the **initial test**, which is not correct.

Alternatively, notice that the **follow-up test** `X(FCE,FBA)` is **structurally similar** to the initial `X(CE,FBP)`, and both are diagnostic tests.

Perhaps we can **abstract** the diagnostic test as a single activity that is repeated.

But the labels are different.

But for modeling purposes, we can treat the **diagnostic test** as a **generic step** that is repeated.

But the problem specifies different labels.

Alternatively, we can model it as:

- First: do `X(CE, FBP)`  initial test
- Then: do `*( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

This means: after initial test, **optionally** do the loop **zero or more times**.

But the process says: **if abnormal, do it at least once**.

But in process tree semantics, the **actual execution** depends on the **result**, which is not modeled.

So we assume that the **loop is taken only when needed**, and the `*` operator allows **repetition**.

But to **enforce at least one execution**, we would need to do:

`->( X(CE,FBP), X( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA), *(tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))) ) )`

That is: after the initial test, we have an **exclusive choice**:
- If results normal: do `tau` (exit)
- If results abnormal: do `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` and then the loop `*(tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)))`

But we **don't have data-based choices** — only structural.

So we **cannot** model the **condition** on test results.

Therefore, the only way is to **assume** that the **loop operator** `*(A,B)` is used such that:
- A is the **first execution** of the loop body
- B is the **repeat** part

But in our case, the **first execution** of the loop body is **not always done** — only if abnormal.

So we are stuck.

**Standard solution in process mining**: Model the loop as `*( DiagnosticTest, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT)) )` but that doesn't match.

After research, a common pattern is:

To model "do A, then while condition, do B", we use:

`->( A, *(tau, B) )`

And assume that the **choice to enter the loop** is made based on context.

So here, we can model:

- After `X(CE, FBP)`, we do `*( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

This allows **zero or more** repetitions of the block.

In reality, if results are normal, we do zero; if abnormal, we do one or more.

But the **first execution** of the block is **not forced**.

But the process says: "if results are abnormal, a loop commences" — and the loop **includes** the first SC.

So the **first SC is part of the loop**.

Therefore, the loop is: **while results are abnormal, do SC  treatment  re-test**

But the **first re-test** is after the first SC.

So the **initial test is separate**, and the **loop starts with SC**.

And the loop can run **zero or more times** — but in this case, it runs **only if abnormal**, and **at least once**.

But since we can't enforce "at least once" without a condition, and process trees are **declarative** in this aspect, we use:

`*( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

And assume that in practice, it is taken when needed.

But this allows **zero times**, which is correct if results are normal.

But if results are abnormal, we need to do it at least once — but the structure doesn't force it.

However, in the context of process trees, the **actual behavior** is governed by the **log**, not the tree alone.

So for modeling purposes, we can use:

`->( InitialTest, *( tau, LoopBody ) )`

And trust that the **loop is taken when necessary**.

But the problem says: "the loop commences" — implying it is **entered**.

So to **enforce at least one execution**, we might need to do:

`->( X(CE,FBP), X( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA), *(tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBP))) ) ) )`

But this requires an **exclusive choice** after the initial test: either do nothing (if normal) or do the loop body and then the optional repeat.

But we don't have a choice based on results.

And the process tree does not have a node for "results evaluation" — it's implicit.

Given the constraints, the best we can do is to **include the first diagnostic in the loop**, but make it clear that it's only done once.

But that's not accurate.

After careful thought, here is the **correct way**:

In many process tree models, a loop that repeats a block **after the first execution** is modeled as:

`->( A, *(tau, B) )`

Where B is the block to repeat.

But in this case, the entire block `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` is done **repeatedly**, and the **first execution** is not separate.

But the process says the **first execution** is triggered by abnormal initial results.

So perhaps the **initial diagnostic test** is not part of the loop, and the **loop is only the treatment and re-test cycle**, but the **first SC is not in the loop**.

But the text says: "a loop commences: the patient must be reviewed by a Specialist Consultation (SC), then treatment, then re-test. This loop repeats."

So the **first SC is the first iteration** of the loop.

Therefore, the loop includes the **first SC**.

So the loop is: **while results are abnormal, do SC  treatment  re-test**

And the loop can run **one or more times**.

But the `*` operator does **A once, then optionally B and repeat A**.

So if we set A = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`, B = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`, then:

`*( A, B )` = do A once, then optionally do B and go back to A.

But then A is done again — so we do the block **at least once**, and then **additional times**.

But when we do B, we go back to A — so we do A again.

So the sequence is: A, then (B, A)*

So the block is executed: 1 + number of times B is taken.

But we want: the block executed k times, k>=1.

So `*( A, B )` with A=B= the block, gives at least one execution, and then optional additional executions.

Perfect.

So we can set:

Let `TreatmentCycle = ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))`

Then `*( TreatmentCycle, TreatmentCycle )` means: do TreatmentCycle once, then optionally do TreatmentCycle again and repeat.

But that's redundant.

We can just write `*( A, A )` with A = TreatmentCycle.

But in practice, we can define it as such.

However, the loop is entered **only if the initial diagnostic is abnormal**.

But the initial diagnostic is **before** the loop.

So the full structure after TC is:

`->( X(CE,FBP), *( TreatmentCycle, TreatmentCycle ) )`

But this means: do the initial test, then do TreatmentCycle at least once, then optionally repeat.

But that forces TreatmentCycle to be done **at least once**, regardless of results.

But we only want it if results are abnormal.

So again, we have a problem.

Unless the "results evaluation" is part of the loop.

Perhaps the `*` operator's A includes the test.

Let's redefine.

Let A = `X(CE,FBP)`  -- first test
B = `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` -- treatment and re-test

Then `*( A, B )` = do A once, then optionally do B and go back to A.

But then after B, we go back to A — so we do `X(CE,FBP)` again, which is not desired.

We want to do `X(FCE,FBA)` in the loop.

So not good.

Final decision:

Given the constraints of process trees, the only way to model this is to **treat the diagnostic test as the same activity** in the loop, even though the label changes.

Or, accept that the loop starts after the first test, and use:

`->( X(CE,FBP), *( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBP)) ) )`

And assume that the **first execution** of the loop body is not required — but in practice, it is taken when needed.

But to **allow at least one execution**, we can't force it.

However, in the context of the problem, we are to model the structure, not the data condition.

So we will use:

- After the initial test, we have a loop that can repeat the treatment and re-test cycle.

- The loop is `*( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )` — zero or more times.

- In reality, it is taken when results are abnormal.

This is the best we can do.

So we proceed.

### **Final Process Tree Structure**

We build the tree from the beginning.

Let's define the tree in parts.

#### 1. Initial sequence:
`->(A, RG, IA, TI, TC)`

#### 2. After TC: exclusive choice of diagnostic test:
`X(CE, FBP)`

So far: `->(A, RG, IA, TI, TC, X(CE, FBP))`

#### 3. After that, loop for abnormal results:
`*( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

So: `->( ->(A, RG, IA, TI, TC, X(CE,FBP)), *(tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))) )`

#### 4. After the loop, do in parallel:
`+(AI, NC)`

#### 5. Then sequence:
`->(FAS, DDI)`

#### 6. Then in parallel:
`+(BL, ICP, MRF)`

#### 7. Whole process is sequence of:
- Initial sequence and test
- Loop
- Parallel: AI, NC
- Sequence: FAS, DDI
- Parallel: BL, ICP, MRF

So overall:

`->( 
    ->(A, RG, IA, TI, TC, X(CE,FBP)), 
    *( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) ), 
    +(AI, NC), 
    ->(FAS, DDI), 
    +(BL, ICP, MRF) 
)`

But the `->` operator takes two arguments, so we need to nest:

`->( 
    ->( 
        ->(A, RG, IA, TI, TC, X(CE,FBP)), 
        *( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) ) 
    ), 
    ->( 
        +(AI, NC), 
        ->(FAS, DDI) 
    ), 
    +(BL, ICP, MRF) 
)`

No, `->` is binary.

So we must nest:

`->( 
    ->( 
        ->( 
            ->(A, RG, IA, TI, TC, X(CE,FBP)), 
            *( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) ) 
        ), 
        +(AI, NC) 
    ), 
    ->( 
        ->(FAS, DDI), 
        +(BL, ICP, MRF) 
    ) 
)`

Better:

Let's build it as a sequence of five parts:

1. `P1 = ->(A, ->(RG, ->(IA, ->(TI, TC))))`  -- initial sequence
2. `P2 = X(CE, FBP)` -- diagnostic test
3. `P3 = *( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )` -- loop
4. `P4 = +(AI, NC)` -- parallel activities
5. `P5 = ->(FAS, DDI)` -- final sequence
6. `P6 = +(BL, ICP, MRF)` -- final parallel

Then the whole process is:

`->( ->( ->( ->( ->(P1, P2), P3 ), P4 ), P5 ), P6 )`

But P1 already includes up to TC, then we do P2.

So `->(P1, P2)` = A->RG->IA->TI->TC->(CE or FBP)

Then `->( that, P3 )` = then the loop

Then `->( that, P4 )` = then AI and NC in parallel

Then `->( that, P5 )` = then FAS->DDI

Then `->( that, P6 )` = then BL, ICP, MRF in parallel

Yes.

Now, within P3, we have:

`*( tau, ->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)) )`

And `->(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` = `->(SC, ->(X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA)))`

And `X(TM,SPT)` is a choice.

And `X(FCE,FBA)` is a choice.

Also, `+(AI, NC)` is parallel.

`+(BL, ICP, MRF)` is parallel.

`->(FAS, DDI)` is sequence.

### **Final Answer: Process Tree in Notation**

The complete process tree in operator notation is:

```
->(
    ->(
        ->(
            ->(
                ->('A', ->('RG', ->('IA', ->('TI', 'TC')))),
                X('CE', 'FBP')
            ),
            *(
                tau,
                ->(
                    'SC',
                    X('TM', 'SPT'),
                    X('FCE', 'FBA')
                )
            )
        ),
        +('AI', 'NC')
    ),
    ->('FAS', 'DDI')
),
+('BL', 'ICP', 'MRF')
)
```

Note: The `->` operator is binary, so we nested it to the left.

This tree captures:
- Sequential flow from arrival to triage
- Exclusive choice of initial diagnostic test
- Loop (zero or more times) of specialist consultation, treatment choice, and re-test if needed
- Parallel advanced imaging and counseling
- Final appointment and discharge instructions
- Final parallel administrative steps

This is the best possible representation within the constraints of process trees.
