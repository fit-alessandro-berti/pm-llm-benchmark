Okay, so I need to come up with a list of questions to ask an interviewee based on the detailed description they provided of their property onboarding process. The goal is to clarify, uncover missing details, understand decision criteria, roles, responsibilities, timing, sequencing, and how exceptions are handled. 

Let me start by going through the process step by step and identifying areas where I have questions or points that need clarification.

1. **Documentation Review**: The process starts with reviewing property deeds, certificates, and inspection reports. The interviewee mentioned that if any documents are missing, the coordinator requests updates. I wonder what happens if the documents are incomplete or take a long time to provide. How is that handled?

2. **Property Assignment to Manager**: The next step is assigning a property manager based on factors like workload, geographic specialization, experience, and track record. I'm curious about how exactly these factors are assessed. For example, does the company have a specific criteria list for each factor, or is it more subjective?

3. **Photographer and Inspector Visit**: After assigning a manager, a photographer and inspector are sent. If there are issues, the manager works with the landlord. What kind of issues are common? How severe do they need to be before action is taken? Are there time constraints for addressing these issues?

4. **Marketing and Online Activation**: The marketing team creates listings and updates pricing models. How are the pricing models determined? Do they use market analysis tools, and how often are these models updated?

5. **Tenant Screening**: The property manager handles tenant screening, which includes credit checks, employment verification, and references. What's the process if multiple tenants apply? How does the company decide who to choose?

6. **Lease Finalization and Move-In**: Once a tenant is selected, the lease is finalized, security deposit collected, and move-in scheduled. How is the lease term determined? Are there standard terms, or does it vary per property?

7. **Quality Checks and Audits**: After activation, there are compliance, financial, and IT checks. How often are these checks conducted? What happens if issues are found during these audits?

8. **Exceptions and Special Cases**: The process mentions some properties require special insurance or have custom lease clauses. How are these exceptions handled? Is there a specific process or documentation for these cases?

9. **Communication and Tracking**: Communication is tracked using emails, CRMs, and project management tools. How integrated are these tools? Is there a central platform, or are multiple tools used?

10. **Training for New Managers**: The process doesn't mention any training for new property managers. Are there onboarding sessions for them, or is it assumed they already know the process?

11. **Timeframe for Each Step**: The process is quite involved. How long does each step typically take? What's the overall timeline from onboarding to the first tenant moving in?

12. **Decision-Making Process**: There are multiple decision points in the process, especially when assigning a manager and selecting a tenant. How is the decision-making power structured? Is it centralized, or do different stakeholders have different levels of authority?

13. **Feedback and Iteration**: After a property is onboarded, is there a feedback loop to improve the process? How often are improvements made based on this feedback?

14. **Integration with Existing Systems**: The IT department checks if the property is correctly integrated. What happens if there's a technical issue that's not caught during onboarding? Is there a troubleshooting process?

15. **Compliance with Laws**: The process mentions fair housing regulations. How is compliance ensured? Are there regular audits, and how are violations addressed?

16. **Handling Repairs**: If the inspector finds issues, the manager works with the landlord. How are contractors or repair services selected? Are there preferred vendors, or is it up to the landlord?

17. **Marketing Strategy**: The marketing team uses the property details to create listings and brochures. What's the strategy for each property? Does it vary based on location, amenities, or target demographic?

18. **Tenant Application Process**: What's the process if a tenant applies but doesn't meet all criteria? Are there steps to accommodate or address this, such as offering a conditional approval?

19. **Security Deposit Handling**: When the security deposit is collected, how is it processed and stored? Is there a specific policy for returning deposits if required?

20. **Special Insurance Requirements**: The process mentions special insurance for some properties. How is this determined? What steps are taken to obtain the necessary insurance?

21. **Training for Tenants**: Are tenants trained on how to maintain the property, especially for special conditions like furnished rentals or luxury units?

22. **Communication with Landlords**: How frequent is communication with landlords after onboarding? What are the touchpoints, and how are issues addressed?

23. **Lease Agreements**: Are standard lease agreements used, or are they tailored for each property? How are legal aspects handled, such as rental laws in different jurisdictions?

24. **Tenant Retention**: After a tenant moves in, how is tenant retention handled? Are there programs or policies to keep tenants longer?

25. **Process Improvements**: Are there regular process reviews or quality audits to identify and implement improvements?

I think these questions cover various aspects of the onboarding process, from documentation and assignment to marketing, tenant screening, lease agreements, quality checks, exceptions, and process improvements. They should help clarify the process, understand decision-making, roles, and how exceptions are handled.
