# Analysis of DECLARE Model Anomalies

## 1. Identified Anomalies

### Anomaly 1: Direct Contradiction Between Existence and Noncoexistence
**Conflicting Constraints:**
- `existence["C"]`: Closing (C) must occur in every claim trace
- `noncoexistence["E"]["activities"]: ["C"]`: Evaluation (E) and Closing (C) cannot coexist in the same trace

**The Contradiction:**
If every claim must be closed (C must exist), and evaluation (E) and closing cannot coexist, then evaluation can **never** occur in any valid trace. This creates a logical impossibility: claims must progress to closure, but the evaluation step that typically informs closure decisions is prohibited.

---

### Anomaly 2: Unreachable Evaluation Activity
**Contributing Constraints:**
- `responded_existence["E"]["activities"]: ["A"]`: Evaluation requires prior assignment
- `noncoexistence["E"]["C"]`: Evaluation cannot coexist with closure
- `existence["C"]`: All claims must close

**The Logical Issue:**
For any claim to complete its lifecycle, it must eventually close (C must occur). However, once evaluation (E) occurs, closing is forbidden. This means evaluation becomes a "dead-end" activity—initiating it makes it impossible to properly complete the claim. Claims that include evaluation cannot satisfy the model's constraints.

---

### Anomaly 3: Precedence Without Possibility
**Contributing Constraints:**
- `precedence["C"]["activities"]: ["R"]`: Closing requires prior receipt
- `existence["C"]`: All claims must close
- `noncoexistence["E"]["C"]`: Evaluation and closing are mutually exclusive

**The Logical Issue:**
While the precedence rule itself is sensible, combined with the other constraints it creates a scenario where the only valid traces are: **R  C** (receive then close, skipping all intermediate steps). This violates the intended process which expects evaluation and approval to occur before closing.

---

## 2. Generated Hypotheses

### Hypothesis A: Data Quality Issues in Model Derivation
**Rationale:** The model may have been automatically derived from historical trace data where:
- A significant portion of claims were closed prematurely without evaluation
- The noncoexistence rule was over-fitted to these outlier traces
- The existence rule was derived from a separate dataset segment, creating inconsistency

**Indicator:** If historical data shows many claims closed immediately after receipt without evaluation steps.

---

### Hypothesis B: Conflicting Business Policy Changes
**Rationale:** 
- Original policy required full evaluation before closure (initial constraints)
- A new expedited processing rule was introduced allowing direct RC paths for certain claim types
- Rather than conditionalizing constraints by claim type, both rules were added unconditionally
- The noncoexistence rule was meant to prevent evaluation in expedited claims but was stated absolutely

**Indicator:** The model lacks differentiation by `claim_type`, suggesting policies weren't decomposed properly.

---

### Hypothesis C: Misalignment Between Model Intent and Specification
**Rationale:**
- The noncoexistence rule was intended to mean: "Do not evaluate **after** closing" (prevent retroactive evaluation)
- It was incorrectly specified as: "Evaluation and closing cannot appear in the same trace at all"
- This represents a specification error rather than a true business requirement

**Indicator:** Domain experts would clarify that evaluation should precede closure, not that they cannot coexist.

---

### Hypothesis D: Pressure to Reduce Claims Processing Time
**Rationale:**
- Organizational pressure to close claims faster led to constraints that permit bypassing evaluation
- The existence rule for closure was added without considering the full process flow
- Evaluation was marked as "impossible" (noncoexistence) to reduce perceived bottlenecks

**Indicator:** Claims with high amounts or specific types show patterns of closure without evaluation.

## 3. Proposed Verification Approaches (SQL Queries)

### Query 1: Identify Claims Closed Without Evaluation
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.claim_type,
    c.submission_date,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) as close_events,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) as eval_events
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type, c.submission_date
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) > 0
   AND COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) = 0
ORDER BY c.claim_amount DESC;
```

**What it detects:** Claims that progressed to closure without any evaluation activity, violating intended process logic.

---

### Query 2: Identify Traces Violating Noncoexistence (E and C Together)
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    STRING_AGG(
        ce.activity || '@' || ce.timestamp::text, 
        '  ' 
        ORDER BY ce.timestamp
    ) as activity_sequence,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ce.activity IN ('E', 'C') THEN ce.activity END) as distinct_E_C_count
FROM claims c
INNER JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) > 0
   AND COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) > 0
ORDER BY c.claim_id;
```

**What it detects:** Claims where both evaluation and closure occurred, demonstrating the noncoexistence rule is violated in practice.

---

### Query 3: Analyze Temporal Relationship Between Evaluation and Closure
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.claim_type,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) as last_eval_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) as first_close_time,
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM 
        MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END)
    ) as days_between_eval_and_close
FROM claims c
INNER JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type
HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
   AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY days_between_eval_and_close;
```

**What it detects:** The temporal ordering between evaluation and closure events, revealing whether evaluation systematically precedes closure (contradicting the noncoexistence rule).

---

### Query 4: Check Responded Existence - Assignment Before Evaluation
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN 1 END) as assignment_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) as evaluation_count,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) as first_assignment,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) as first_evaluation
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) > 0
   AND (
       COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN 1 END) = 0
       OR MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) > 
          MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END)
   )
ORDER BY c.claim_id;
```

**What it detects:** Evaluation events that occur without prior assignment, or where assignment follows evaluation, violating the responded existence constraint.

---

### Query 5: Process Completeness Analysis
```sql
WITH expected_activities AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id, 
           ARRAY['R', 'A', 'E', 'P', 'N', 'C'] as expected_steps
    FROM claim_events
),
actual_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT activity ORDER BY activity) as actual_steps
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    actual.actual_steps,
    ARRAY_LENGTH(actual.actual_steps, 1) as steps_completed,
    CASE 
        WHEN ARRAY_LENGTH(actual.actual_steps, 1) < 4 THEN 'Incomplete'
        WHEN ARRAY_LENGTH(actual.actual_steps, 1) >= 6 THEN 'Complete'
        ELSE 'Partial'
    END as process_status
FROM claims c
JOIN actual_activities actual ON c.claim_id = actual.claim_id
ORDER BY steps_completed, c.claim_amount DESC;
```

**What it detects:** The extent to which claims follow the full intended process, revealing systematic gaps in execution.

---

### Query 6: Identify Claims Following RC Shortcut Path
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.claim_type,
    STRING_AGG(ce.activity, '' ORDER BY ce.timestamp) as process_path,
    COUNT(*) as total_events
FROM claims c
INNER JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type
HAVING STRING_AGG(ce.activity, '' ORDER BY ce.timestamp) IN ('RC', 'RNC', 'RAC')
ORDER BY c.claim_amount DESC;
```

**What it detects:** Claims that bypass evaluation and approval, following only the minimal receive-to-close path allowed by the contradictory constraints.

## 4. Summary of Verification Strategy

These queries collectively reveal:
1. **Prevalence** of the contradiction in actual data
2. **Patterns** in which types/amounts of claims are affected
3. **Temporal dynamics** that might explain the anomaly
4. **Root cause indicators** pointing toward specific hypotheses

The results should determine whether this is a specification error, a data quality issue, or a deliberate (but poorly documented) policy allowing expedited processing paths.
