Below is a concise, business- and control-flow–oriented assessment of the two POWL models against a normative Hire-to-Retire flow (roughly: Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  if hire then Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case; if no-hire then Close_Case).

Model 1 (StrictPartialOrder with only precedence constraints)
What it enforces
- Post before Screen (good).
- Screen before both Interview and Decide (good that decision cannot precede screening).
- Decide before Onboard  Payroll  Close (good that payroll precedes close for hires).

What it fails to enforce / anomalies
- Decision not ordered after Interview: Interview and Decide are concurrent once Screen is done. This allows: Decide before Interview, and even Close before Interview.
  Example trace allowed: Post, Screen, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close, Interview. Closing before finishing interviews is a severe semantic violation.
- No rejection path: After Decide, the model forces Onboard  Payroll  Close. It models “always hire”; you cannot close a case without onboarding/payroll. This is a major deviation from a real hiring process.
- Interview is mandatory in every case (because all nodes of the partial order must occur), even when a negative decision would make it unnecessary. Combined with the first anomaly, you may “interview after close,” which is nonsensical.

Severity summary for Model 1
- Major: no reject/close-without-hire branch; decision may precede interview; close may precede interview.
- Minor-to-moderate: forces interview in all cases.

Model 2 (adds LOOP around onboarding and XOR with skip for payroll)
What it enforces
- Post precedes Screen and Interview.
- Interview precedes Decide.
- Decide precedes onboarding loop; onboarding precedes the XOR(Payroll, skip) and then Close.

What it fails to enforce / anomalies
- Screening and interviewing are parallel after posting: Interview can occur before Screen. Decision depends only on Interview, not on Screen. This allows making the hiring decision without screening being completed, and even closing the case before screening is done.
  Example allowed: Post, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Close, Screen (since Payroll can be skipped). Closing before screening is severe.
- Onboarding mandatory and repeatable: LOOP(Onboard, skip) with a silent redo means Onboard occurs at least once and can be repeated arbitrarily. Multiple onboardings for one hire is typically invalid.
- Payroll is optional: XOR(Payroll, skip) enables Close without ever adding the (onboarded!) employee to payroll. This is a critical violation for a Hire-to-Retire process.
- No rejection path: As in Model 1, you cannot close directly after a negative decision; the model implies “always hire.”

Severity summary for Model 2
- Critical: can close without payroll; decision can ignore screening; screening may happen after case close; repeated onboarding.
- Major: no reject/close-without-hire branch.

Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process?
Model 1 is closer.

Rationale
- Model 1 keeps the basic backbone consistent for the hire path (Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close) and ensures Screen precedes both Interview and Decide. Its biggest flaws are the missing rejection branch and the freedom to decide/close before interviews complete.
- Model 2 introduces more severe and numerous violations: it permits interviewing before screening; allows deciding and closing without completed screening; allows skipping payroll after onboarding; and allows multiple onboardings. These issues undermine core business correctness and case integrity more than the issues in Model 1.

If you wanted to move either model toward a normative version, you would at least:
- Impose total order Screen  Interview  Decide.
- Add an XOR after Decide to branch to either Onboard  Payroll  Close (hire) or Close (reject).
- Remove the onboarding loop (or scope it to exceptional rework with clear guards) and make Payroll mandatory whenever the hire branch is taken.
- Ensure Close is ordered after all required activities for the chosen branch.
