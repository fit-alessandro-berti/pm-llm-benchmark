### 1. Normative HiretoRetire sequence

If we focus on a *successful hire* variant, a standard controlflow would be roughly:

1. `Post_Job_Ad`
2. `Screen_Candidates`
3. `Conduct_Interviews`
4. `Make_Hiring_Decision`
5. `Onboard_Employee`
6. `Add_to_Payroll`
7. `Close_Case`

All steps should occur, and the order is essentially linear (possibly with some rework/loops on screening/interviews).

## 2. Analysis of POWL Model 1

### Structure

Nodes: `Post`, `Screen`, `Interview`, `Decide`, `Onboard`, `Payroll`, `Close`  
Precedence edges:

- `Post  Screen`
- `Screen  Decide`
- `Screen  Interview`
- `Decide  Onboard`
- `Onboard  Payroll`
- `Payroll  Close`

Because this is a pure `StrictPartialOrder` (no XOR, no loop), **all activities occur exactly once in every execution**; only their order is partially constrained.

### Consequences

From the edges, we only know:

- `Post` < `Screen`
- `Screen` < `Decide`
- `Screen` < `Interview`
- `Decide` < `Onboard` < `Payroll` < `Close`

There is **no constraint** between `Interview` and:

- `Decide`
- `Onboard`
- `Payroll`
- `Close`

So any topological order consistent with the above is allowed. Examples:

- Normativelooking trace:  
  `Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close`
- Highly problematic allowed trace:  
  `Post, Screen, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close, Interview`

### Anomalies in Model 1

1. **Decision not dependent on interviews** (major anomaly)
   - `Conduct_Interviews` is *not* required to precede `Make_Hiring_Decision`.
   - You can decide before the interview even starts, e.g.:  
     `Post, Screen, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close, Interview`.
   - This breaks the usual logic “interviews inform the hiring decision”.

2. **Interviews can happen after onboarding, payroll, and even after case closure** (severe anomaly)
   - Because `Interview` has no outgoing edges, it is a second “end” activity together with `Close`.
   - You can:
     - Onboard, add to payroll, and close the case, then still “conduct interviews.”
   - This violates the basic temporal logic of the case: you should not be interviewing after the case is closed and the person is already onboarded and paid.

3. **No branch for “not hired”** (less severe in this context)
   - Every case always executes `Onboard` and `Add_to_Payroll`, i.e., the model only represents the “hired” path; rejection is not modeled.
   - For a “successful hire” variant this is acceptable, but it reduces realism.

4. **Two implicit end points (Interview, Close)** (symptom of 1 and 2)
   - Finishing the interview and closing the case are independent; whichever happens last marks completion.
   - This is odd for workflow integrity but is essentially a consequence of (1) and (2).

**Positive aspect of Model 1:**  
Once the decision is made, the *postdecision chain is clean and mandatory*:

`Decide  Onboard  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case`

No possibility to skip onboarding or payroll; no payroll before onboarding; case always closes only after payroll.

## 3. Analysis of POWL Model 2

### Structure

Nodes: `Post`, `Screen`, `Interview`, `Decide`, `loop_onboarding`, `xor_payroll`, `Close`, with:

- `loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)`
  - Execute `Onboard` at least once; may repeat `skip  Onboard` any number of times.
- `xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)`
  - Either `Add_to_Payroll` or a silent skip.

Precedence edges:

- `Post  Screen`
- `Post  Interview`
- `Interview  Decide`
- `Decide  loop_onboarding`
- `loop_onboarding  xor_payroll`
- `xor_payroll  Close`

Again, all nodes in the SPO appear in each execution, but internal operators (LOOP/XOR) define variants inside.

### Consequences

From the edges:

- `Post` < `Screen`
- `Post` < `Interview`
- `Interview` < `Decide` < `loop_onboarding` < `xor_payroll` < `Close`

No constraints from `Screen` to `Interview`, `Decide` or further.

Possible traces:

- Normativelooking:  
  `Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close`
- Problematic:  
  `Post, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Close, Screen` (screening after closure, payroll skipped)
- Another problematic:  
  `Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Close` (no payroll at all).

### Anomalies in Model 2

1. **Screening decoupled from interviews and decision** (major anomaly)
   - `Screen_Candidates` is only constrained to occur after `Post_Job_Ad`.
   - It may occur:
     - In parallel with `Interview`,
     - After `Decide`,
     - Even after `Close_Case`, e.g.:  
       `Post, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close, Screen`.
   - The hiring decision is driven purely by the interviews; screening results are not enforced as a prerequisite.

2. **Payroll is optional** via `xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)` (very severe anomaly)
   - There is a path:  
     `Post, Interview, Decide, Onboard, skip(Payroll), Close, Screen`
   - That means:
     - The employee can be **onboarded and the case closed without ever being added to payroll**.
   - For a HiretoRetire process, “Add_to_Payroll” is essential for a successful hire; allowing it to be skipped undermines process correctness and legal/financial integrity.

3. **Multiple onboardings of the same employee** (moderate anomaly)
   - `LOOP(Onboard, skip)` allows:
     - `Onboard`
     - or `Onboard, skip, Onboard, skip, Onboard, …`
   - In reality, repeated identical “Onboard_Employee” steps without any intervening activities are unusual; one would expect more granular subtasks rather than reexecuting the same activity in a blank loop.
   - This is more of a modeling oddity than a fundamental violation.

4. **Screening can occur after case closure** (similar pattern as Model 1’s interview issue, but earlier in the chain)
   - Because `Screen` has no outgoing edges, it is effectively another end activity.
   - Businesswise, doing candidate screening after closure is clearly nonsensical.

**Positive aspects of Model 2:**

- It enforces **interviews before decision**: `Interview  Decide`, which reflects typical hiring logic better than Model 1.
- It maintains the correct order between decision, onboarding, and (if taken) payroll.

## 4. Which model is closer to the normative HiretoRetire process?

Both models contain significant anomalies, but they differ in where they “break” the logic.

- **Model 1**
  - Pros:
    - All key activities (`Post`, `Screen`, `Interview`, `Decide`, `Onboard`, `Payroll`, `Close`) are mandatory.
    - The administrative tail is correct and strict:  
      `Decide  Onboard  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case`.
  - Cons:
    - Interviews do not constrain the hiring decision.
    - Interviews can occur after onboarding, payroll, and closure.

- **Model 2**
  - Pros:
    - Correctly enforces `Interview` before `Decide`.
  - Cons:
    - Screening does not constrain the decision and can occur even after closure.
    - Most critically, **payroll is optional**: a hired and onboarded employee may never be added to payroll.
    - Onboarding can be repeated in a somewhat nonsensical loop.

From a *process integrity* perspective, **skipping `Add_to_Payroll` after a successful hire (Model 2)** is a more fundamental violation of the essence of a HiretoRetire process than allowing the interview to be temporally misplaced (Model 1). Model 1 at least guarantees that every hire is onboarded, put on payroll, and caseclosed in the proper administrative order.

**Therefore, Model 1 is closer to a normative HiretoRetire process**.  
Model 2 deviates more seriously by making payroll optional and allowing screening after closure, which undermines the core financial and control objectives of the process.
