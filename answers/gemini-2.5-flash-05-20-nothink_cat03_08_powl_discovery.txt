Let's analyze the event log to identify the control-flow patterns for building the POWL model.

**Analysis of Event Log:**

1.  **Sequential Flow:**
    *   `OR` is always the first activity.
    *   `MS` always follows `OR`.
    *   `QS` always follows `MS`.
    *   `AS` always follows `QS`.
    *   `PK` always follows `TST` (or `RT` if it leads back to `TST`).
    *   `DP` always follows `PK` or `LB`.
    *   `D` always follows `DP`.

2.  **IQC Loop:**
    *   `IQC` can appear after `AS`.
    *   After `IQC`, `AS` can repeat (`Case 1`, `Case 2`, `Case 3`, `Case 5`).
    *   It seems `IQC` is a check that might lead to re-assembly. This suggests a loop where `AS` is done, then `IQC` is done, and if `IQC` finds issues, `AS` is done again. The loop can exit to `TST`.
    *   `Case 4` shows `AS` directly leading to `TST` without `IQC`. This means `IQC` (and the associated `AS` loop) is optional.

3.  **TST/RT Loop:**
    *   `TST` appears after `AS` (or the `AS`/`IQC` loop).
    *   `RT` appears after `TST` if the test fails (`Case 1`, `Case 3`, `Case 5`).
    *   After `RT`, `TST` is repeated.
    *   This is a classic `DO A, then B, repeat A` loop: `TST` is `A`, `RT` is `B`. The loop continues as long as `RT` is needed. It exits to `PK`.

4.  **LB Choice:**
    *   `PK` is always followed by either `LB` or `DP`.
    *   `Case 1`, `Case 3`, `Case 4`, `Case 5` show `PK` then `LB` then `DP`.
    *   `Case 2` shows `PK` directly to `DP`, skipping `LB`.
    *   This indicates an exclusive choice (`XOR`) between `LB` and a `SilentTransition` (skip).

5.  **Concurrency/Partial Order:**
    *   The primary flow is sequential. We will model this with a `StrictPartialOrder` where each main stage depends on the completion of the previous one.
    *   Within the `StrictPartialOrder`, the complex parts (IQC loop, TST/RT loop, LB choice) will be represented as sub-models.

---

**POWL Model Construction:**

Let's define the activities as `Transition` objects first.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Define all basic activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip = SilentTransition()
```

Now, let's build the complex sub-models:

**A. IQC Loop (Optional):**
This is an `AS` followed by an `IQC`, where `IQC` can lead back to `AS`. However, the entire `AS -> (IQC -> AS)* -> TST` block is conditional. Case 4 shows `AS` directly to `TST`. This means the `IQC` part is a loop within an optional sequence, or simply that `AS` and `IQC` form a loop, and this entire loop structure is optional *after* the initial `AS` and *before* `TST`.

Given `AS` can precede `IQC` multiple times (Case 3, 5), and `IQC` can lead back to `AS`, this looks like `*(AS, IQC)`. But then, Case 4 shows `AS` directly to `TST`.
This suggests an initial `AS`, followed by an optional block that is `*(IQC, AS)`.

Let's refine this:
The process always has an `AS`. After `AS`, *optionally* an `IQC` can happen, which if it happens, can cause a re-`AS`.
So, `AS` must occur. Then, there's a loop where the "body" is `IQC` and the "do-again" part is `AS`.
This means: `AS` is executed. Then, you can *optionally* enter a loop: `*(IQC, AS)`.
No, the loop definition `*(A,B)` means `A` then (`exit` or `B` then `A` again).
So `*(IQC, AS)` means `IQC`, then (`exit` or `AS` then `IQC` again). This fits the observed pattern well after an initial `AS`.

Let's define the `AS/IQC` loop:
```python
# The loop structure for AS and IQC: IQC can lead to re-assembly (AS).
# So, after an initial AS, the loop part is: execute IQC, then if needed, AS, then IQC again.
# The definition *(A,B) is: A, then either exit, or B then A again.
# This means: A is IQC, B is AS.
iqc_loop_core = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])

# The AS activity itself is always there.
# But the IQC loop is optional after AS.
# So, it's AS, then a choice between the IQC loop and skipping it.
# However, the event log shows AS...IQC...AS...IQC...AS...TST
# This implies the IQC is part of a loop that re-triggers AS.
# The `POWL` definition of loop is: `*(A, B)` -> `A`, then `exit` or `B` then `A` again.
# If `A` is `IQC` and `B` is `AS`: `IQC` then `exit` or `AS` then `IQC` again. This perfectly models the re-assembly based on IQC.
# But `AS` is always done first before IQC.
# So, the sequence is `AS`, then a loop that performs `IQC` and optionally `AS` again.
# This can be structured as:
# Main sequence: OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> (IQC_Loop_Optional) -> TST -> ...
# IQC_Loop_Optional: XOR(IQC_Loop_core, skip)
# This isn't quite right as `AS` can be repeated *within* the `IQC` loop.

# Let's consider the sequence AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST.
# The repeated part is (IQC -> AS).
# This is an `AS` (initial), then `IQC`, then `(AS -> IQC)*`.
# Or more simply, `*(AS, IQC)` where `AS` is the initial part of the loop.
# `*(A,B)` means A, then either you exit, or B then A again.
# Let A = AS, B = IQC. This means AS, then either exit, or IQC then AS again.
# This looks like `AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS`. This works for the repeated `AS` followed by `IQC`.
# However, Case 4 has no IQC. This implies the entire `*(AS, IQC)` block (after the initial `AS`) is optional.
# This is tricky. Let's make the `IQC` activity itself optional after each `AS`, and if it happens, it leads back to `AS`.
# This implies a structure like: AS then XOR( *(IQC, AS) , skip).
# No, simpler: `AS` activity. Then, a loop that starts with `IQC` and potentially leads back to `AS`.
# Loop: `*(IQC, AS)` means `IQC` -> `exit` OR `AS` -> `IQC`. This correctly models re-IQC after re-AS.
# The initial `AS` is always there.
# So, `AS` is followed by an `XOR` choice: either execute the `IQC` loop, or skip to `TST`.
# If we choose the `IQC` loop, the very first activity is `IQC`.
# This is the `IQC_loop_core` as defined above: `IQC_loop_core = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])`
# This `IQC_loop_core` should be optional.
# So, `AS_IQC_Block = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[AS, XOR(iqc_loop_core, skip_IQC_loop_entry)], order={AS -> XOR(...)})`
# This represents `AS` then an optional `IQC` loop.
```

Let's rethink the `AS`/`IQC` structure based on all cases.
*   `AS` happens.
*   Then `IQC` *can* happen. If `IQC` happens, `AS` can happen again.
*   This is `AS`, then `XOR(IQC_loop_block, skip_IQC_block)`.
*   The `IQC_loop_block` is `*(IQC, AS)`. This means `IQC`, then optionally `AS` then `IQC` again.

Let's represent the `AS`/`IQC` section as a distinct sub-process.
It must start with `AS`.
It can repeat `IQC` and `AS`.
It can also go `AS` directly to `TST` (Case 4).

This means the `IQC` part is optional. And if `IQC` happens, it can lead to another `AS`.
So, the structure is:
1.  An `AS` activity.
2.  Then, an `XOR` choice:
    *   Path A: The loop `*(IQC, AS)`. This means `IQC` then optionally `AS` and `IQC` again.
    *   Path B: `skip`.
This doesn't quite fit. The `AS` is *inside* the loop.

Let's consider `IQC_Loop_Node = *(IQC, AS)`. This implies `IQC`, then (exit OR `AS` then `IQC`).
The process is `AS` followed by `IQC_Loop_Node` or `skip`.
```python
# `IQC` followed by optional re-`AS`
iqc_re_as_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])

# The option to skip the IQC sequence entirely after AS
# So, after initial AS, we either execute iqc_re_as_loop OR skip.
# This entire construct (initial AS + optional iqc_re_as_loop) becomes a node in the main PO.
```
Let's call the complete `AS` and optional `IQC` loop block `AS_IQC_Process`.

```python
# The AS activity is always executed initially before any potential IQC loop.
# Let's say `AS` is A.
# The loop definition: *(A,B) means A, then (exit or B then A again).
# If A = IQC, B = AS: *(IQC, AS) means IQC, then (exit or AS then IQC again).
# This represents the `IQC -> AS` feedback loop.
# The *entire* IQC -> AS loop block is optional after the initial `AS`.

# Option 1: AS followed by an optional loop.
# Initial AS node
AS_node = AS

# The loop of IQC potentially leading to AS
iqc_as_loop_body = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])

# Choice after AS: either the IQC-AS loop or skip.
# This choice represents the path *after* the initial AS.
# The problem is that the loop definition `*(A,B)` implies `A` is always executed *first* within the loop.
# If `A` is `IQC`, then `IQC` must be executed to enter the loop.
# `Case 4` shows no `IQC`. So the `IQC` loop itself must be optional.

# The `AS` activity is always there.
# The core loop is: `IQC` happens, and if it fails, `AS` happens again. This is `*(IQC, AS)`.
# Let's call `IQC_AS_LOOP = *(IQC, AS)`.
# The flow is `AS` -> then `XOR(IQC_AS_LOOP, skip)`.
# This seems correct for `AS` followed by an *optional* `IQC` loop.
# The `AS_IQC_NODE` will encapsulate this:
AS_IQC_LOOP_NODE = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])
OPTIONAL_AS_IQC_FLOW = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[AS_IQC_LOOP_NODE, skip]) # AS_IQC_LOOP_NODE is defined above

# The whole block for `AS` and its optional `IQC` loop:
# It's an AS node, and this AS node leads to the optional IQC flow.
# This structure isn't easily represented by a single PO with `AS` as a child and the XOR as a child.
# `StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[AS, OPTIONAL_AS_IQC_FLOW], order={AS --> OPTIONAL_AS_IQC_FLOW})`
# Let's try this. This means `AS` then either `IQC` repeatedly, or `skip`. This models Case 4 correctly.
# This represents: `AS` -> (`IQC` -> `AS` -> `IQC`... or `skip`). This matches the cases.
# So, the node `AS_IQC_Process` will be this `StrictPartialOrder`.
```

**B. TST/RT Loop:**
`TST` (execute A), then either exit, or `RT` (execute B) and then `TST` again.
This perfectly maps to `*(TST, RT)`.
```python
# TST followed by optional re-testing (RT)
TST_RT_LOOP = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])
```

**C. LB Choice:**
`PK`, then either `LB` or `skip`.
This maps to `X(LB, skip)`.
```python
# PK followed by choice of LB or skip
LB_CHOICE = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])
```

**Putting it all together in the main `StrictPartialOrder`:**

The main flow is sequential: `OR` -> `MS` -> `QS` -> `AS/IQC Block` -> `TST/RT Loop` -> `PK` -> `LB Choice` -> `DP` -> `D`.

```python
# Define all basic activities (as in the template)
OR_act = Transition(label="OR")
MS_act = Transition(label="MS")
QS_act = Transition(label="QS")
AS_act = Transition(label="AS")
IQC_act = Transition(label="IQC")
TST_act = Transition(label="TST")
RT_act = Transition(label="RT")
PK_act = Transition(label="PK")
LB_act = Transition(label="LB")
DP_act = Transition(label="DP")
D_act = Transition(label="D")
skip_act = SilentTransition() # General skip

# 1. AS and optional IQC loop
# The core loop where IQC can lead to re-AS
IQC_LOOP = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC_act, AS_act])
# The entire AS block: initial AS, then optionally the IQC loop.
# This is best represented as a sequence: AS_act followed by an XOR.
# But the definition of PO is for concurrency.
# Let's re-examine `AS -> (IQC -> AS)* -> TST`.
# It's an initial `AS`. Then, if `IQC` is done, it can loop back to `AS`.
# `*(A, B)` means `A` then `exit` or `B` then `A`.
# If we define `AS_IQC_BLOCK = *(AS, IQC)` this means `AS`, then (`exit` or `IQC` then `AS`). This perfectly models the
# repeated `AS` if `IQC` leads to it.
# Now, Case 4: `AS` directly to `TST`. This means this `AS_IQC_BLOCK` is *optional* after `QS`.
# So, after `QS`, there's `XOR(AS_IQC_BLOCK, skip)`.
# Let's use this interpretation for the `AS` and `IQC` part.

# A. AS and optional IQC loop
# The loop for AS, potentially re-executing AS based on IQC
AS_IQC_Process = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS_act, IQC_act])
# Since AS can sometimes lead directly to TST (Case 4),
# this whole AS_IQC_Process is optional after QS.
# This isn't quite right. AS always happens. IQC is optional.
# The event log shows `AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> TST`
# It shows `AS -> TST`
# The model `*(A,B)` means `A` then `exit` or `B` then `A` again.
# If `A = AS` and `B = IQC`, then `*(AS, IQC)` represents `AS` then (`exit` or `IQC` then `AS`).
# This covers `AS -> TST` (exit after 1st AS) and `AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST` (IQC then AS then exit) etc.
# This seems to be the most fitting for `AS` and `IQC`.

AS_IQC_BLOCK = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS_act, IQC_act])

# B. TST/RT Loop
# *(TST, RT) means TST, then (exit or RT then TST)
TST_RT_LOOP = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST_act, RT_act])

# C. LB Choice
# X(LB, skip) means either LB or nothing
LB_CHOICE = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB_act, skip_act])

# Create the root StrictPartialOrder
# The main nodes in the sequential flow are: OR, MS, QS, AS_IQC_BLOCK, TST_RT_LOOP, PK, LB_CHOICE, DP, D
root_nodes = [OR_act, MS_act, QS_act, AS_IQC_BLOCK, TST_RT_LOOP, PK_act, LB_CHOICE, DP_act, D_act]
root_powl = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=root_nodes)

# Add the sequential order

# 2. Define complex sub-models using Operators

# A. AS and optional IQC loop

# This captures the observed variability.

# B. TST and RT loop
# The loop pattern is *(A, B) meaning A, then (exit or B then A again).

# C. LB (Labeling) Choice
# An exclusive choice between executing 'LB' or skipping it.
LB_Choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB_act, skip_act])

# 3. Define the overall process using StrictPartialOrder

])
