We have a loan application process with strict normative rules and some recommended best practices (desiderata). We need to analyze three cases from an event log.

First, let me understand the normative constraints clearly:
1. Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case
2. Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment
3. Risk Assessment must occur before Loan Decision
4. Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision
5. If loan is approved, Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case
6. If loan is rejected, do NOT finalize documentation before closing

Desiderata (recommendations, not strict):
1. Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received
2. Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision
3. Follow-up Call before closing the case (encouraged but not required)

Now let's analyze each case:

**Case 1:**
- Application Received: 2024-01-10 09:00
- Credit Check: 2024-01-10 09:30 (30 minutes later, OK)
- Risk Assessment: 2024-01-10 10:00 (after Credit Check, OK)
- Loan Decision (Approved): 2024-01-10 11:00 (after Risk Assessment, OK)
- Inform Applicant: 2024-01-10 13:00 (2 hours after decision, OK)
- Finalize Documentation: 2024-01-10 13:30 (after decision and info, OK)
- Close Case: 2024-01-10 14:00 (after documentation, OK)

Normative check:
- Sequence is correct: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- Credit Check before Risk Assessment: Yes (09:30 < 10:00)
- Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: Yes (10:00 < 11:00)
- Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: Yes (13:00 > 11:00)
- Since approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case: Yes (13:30 < 14:00)
- No contradictory actions: No documentation after rejection (was approved)

Desiderata check:
- Credit Check within 24h of Application: 30 minutes, YES (well within)
- Inform Applicant within 48h of Loan Decision: 2 hours, YES (well within)
- Follow-up Call: Not present in log

**Case 1 Result:** No normative violations. Desiderata violations: Missing Follow-up Call (but this is just a recommendation).

**Case 2:**
- Application Received: 2024-01-11 08:00
- Risk Assessment: 2024-01-11 08:20 (NO prior Credit Check - this is a violation)
- Credit Check: 2024-01-11 09:00 (happens AFTER Risk Assessment)
- Loan Decision (Rejected): 2024-01-11 09:30
- Finalize Documentation: 2024-01-11 10:00 (This is NOT allowed after rejection)
- Close Case: 2024-01-11 10:30

Normative violations:
1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check: "Credit Check must occur before any risk evaluation is done." This is a clear violation. The log shows Risk Assessment at 08:20, but the first Credit Check is at 09:00.
2. Finalize Documentation after rejection: "If the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation." This is a clear violation. They finalized documentation even though decision was Rejected.

Desiderata check:
- Credit Check timing: We can't check the 24h rule properly because the sequence is wrong. But even if we consider the absolute time: from 08:00 to 09:00 is 1 hour, which is within 24h. But the violation is normative, not desiderata.
- Inform Applicant timing: Wait, there's no "Inform Applicant" activity in Case 2! Let me re-read the log.

Looking at the log again for Case 2:
- Application Received: 08:00
- Risk Assessment: 08:20 (violation: no Credit Check first)
- Credit Check: 09:00 (out of order)
- Loan Decision (Rejected): 09:30
- Finalize Documentation: 10:00 (violation: should not happen for rejection)
- Close Case: 10:30

Missing: "Inform Applicant" activity entirely. This is also a normative violation because "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision" - it's missing entirely.

Let me double-check the log table format. The table shows:
| 2 | 2024-01-11 08:20 | Risk Assessment | *(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)* |
| 2 | 2024-01-11 09:00 | Credit Check | 
| 2 | 2024-01-11 09:30 | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 2 | 2024-01-11 10:00 | Finalize Documentation| *(Not allowed after rejection)* |
| 2 | 2024-01-11 10:30 | Close Case |

So the log doesn't show "Inform Applicant" for Case 2 at all. That's another normative violation.

Desiderata for Case 2:
- Since there's no "Inform Applicant", we can't check the 48h rule, but the absence of this required step is a normative issue, not desiderata.
- No "Follow-up Call" either, but that's just a desideratum.

**Case 3:**
- Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00
- Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00 (more than 24 hours later - desideratum violation)
- Risk Assessment: 2024-01-14 11:00 (after Credit Check, OK)
- Loan Decision (Approved): 2024-01-14 12:00 (after Risk Assessment, OK)
- Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00 (later than 48 hours after decision - desideratum violation)
- Finalize Documentation: 2024-01-17 09:00 (after decision and info, OK)
- Close Case: 2024-01-17 10:00 (after documentation, OK)
- (No Follow-up Call) - desideratum violation

Normative check:
- Sequence: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case - all present and in order
- Credit Check before Risk Assessment: Yes (14th 10:00 < 14th 11:00)
- Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: Yes (14th 11:00 < 14th 12:00)
- Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: Yes (16th 15:00 > 14th 12:00)
- Since approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case: Yes (17th 09:00 < 17th 10:00)
- No contradictory actions: No documentation after rejection (was approved)

All normative rules are satisfied.

Desiderata violations:
1. Credit Check not within 24h: From 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00 is 2 days + 1 hour = 49 hours, which exceeds 24 hours.
2. Inform Applicant not within 48h: From 2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00 is 2 days + 3 hours = 51 hours, which exceeds 48 hours.
3. No Follow-up Call before closing.

Let me summarize my findings:

**Case 1:**
- Normative: Fully compliant
- Desiderata: Missing Follow-up Call (minor)

**Case 2:**
- Normative: Multiple violations
  1. Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (order violation)
  2. Missing "Inform Applicant" step entirely (required sequence violation)
  3. Finalize Documentation performed after Rejection decision (contradiction)
- Desiderata: Missing Follow-up Call (minor, but overshadowed by normative issues)

**Case 3:**
- Normative: Fully compliant
- Desiderata: Three violations
  1. Credit Check took >24h (49 hours)
  2. Inform Applicant took >48h (51 hours)
  3. No Follow-up Call

Now I need to structure the answer clearly, addressing each part of the task.

The task asks me to:
1. Identify normative violations and explain reasons
2. Identify desiderata failures and clarify they're not severe
3. Suggest interpretations/justifications where possible

For interpretations/justifications:
- Case 2: Could be a data entry error (timestamps swapped for Risk Assessment and Credit Check), or staff error. The "Finalize Documentation after Rejection" could be a system glitch or human error where someone didn't check the decision status.
- Case 3: The delays might be due to workload, system downtime, or waiting for additional information. The missing follow-up call might be due to resource constraints.

I should present this in a clear, structured format.

## **Analysis Summary**

### **Case 1: Fully Compliant **
**Normative Compliance:**  
This case follows the entire mandatory sequence without any violations:
- Correct order: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
- All precedence rules respected (e.g., Credit Check before Risk Assessment)  
- Documentation only finalized after approval, as required  

**Desiderata Deviations:**  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**: This is the only shortcoming. While recommended, its absence is *not a serious violation*—it represents a missed opportunity for customer engagement rather than a procedural failure.

---

### **Case 2: Normative Violations  (Multiple Serious Breaches)**
**Normative Violations (3 Critical Issues):**

1. **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check**  
   - *Timestamp:* Risk Assessment (08:20) occurs **prior** to Credit Check (09:00)  
   - *Violation:* Direct breach of "Credit Check must be performed before any risk evaluation." This is a fundamental sequencing error.

2. **Missing "Inform Applicant" Activity**  
   - *Issue:* The mandatory step of notifying the applicant after the decision is entirely absent from the event log.  
   - *Violation:* Breaks the required post-decision protocol and leaves the applicant unaware of their status.

3. **Documentation Finalized After Rejection**  
   - *Timestamp:* Finalize Documentation (10:00) executed despite Loan Decision = Rejected (09:30)  
   - *Violation:* Directly contradicts the rule: *"If the loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."* This is a serious logical error that wastes resources.

**Desiderata Deviations:**  
- Missing Follow-up Call (minor, but irrelevant given the normative failures)

**Possible Interpretations:**  
- **Data Entry Error:** The timestamps for Risk Assessment and Credit Check may have been swapped during logging.  
- **Human/System Error:** Staff may have overlooked the rejection status when triggering documentation finalization, or a system bug allowed the activity to proceed unchecked.  
- **Process Bypass:** The missing "Inform Applicant" could indicate an intentional shortcut (e.g., a silent rejection), which is non-compliant.

---

### **Case 3: Desiderata Violations Only **
**Normative Compliance:**  
All strict rules are satisfied:  
- Correct activity sequence maintained  
- All required activities present and in proper order  
- Documentation correctly handled for approved loan  

**Desiderata Deviations (3 Suboptimal Issues):**

1. **Credit Check Delayed Beyond 24 Hours**  
   - *Duration:* 49 hours elapsed (Jan 12 09:00  Jan 14 10:00)  
   - *Impact:* Indicates slower processing; may affect customer satisfaction or service-level agreements.

2. **Applicant Notification Delayed Beyond 48 Hours**  
   - *Duration:* 51 hours elapsed after decision (Jan 14 12:00  Jan 16 15:00)  
   - *Impact:* Leaves applicant uncertain; may generate follow-up inquiries.

3. **Missing Follow-up Call**  
   - *Impact:* Lost chance to confirm understanding and maintain relationship.

**Possible Justifications:**  
- **Operational Constraints:** Weekend/holiday periods (Jan 12–14) could explain the 2-day gap for Credit Check.  
- **Workload/Backlog:** High application volume or staff shortages may have delayed notification.  
- **Resource Prioritization:** The Follow-up Call may have been deprioritized for simpler cases or due to limited personnel—these are *recommendations*, not requirements.

## **Key Distinction**

| Violation Type | Seriousness | Examples |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Normative (Strict Rules)** |  **Critical** – Undermines process integrity | Sequence errors, missing mandatory steps, contradictory actions |
| **Desiderata (Recommendations)** |  **Minor** – Suboptimal but permissible | Timing delays, optional activities skipped |

**Bottom Line:**  
- **Case 2** requires immediate investigation and corrective action due to multiple hard-rule violations.  
- **Case 3** is procedurally sound but operationally inefficient; improvements should focus on reducing delays and adding follow-up calls to enhance service quality.
