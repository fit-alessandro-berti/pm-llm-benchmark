# Description of the Visualization

This figure contains three related components illustrating a **proclet-based workflow model** for a laboratory testing process:

## (a) Two Proclet Classes Connected Through Two Channels

This is the main diagram showing two interconnected process workflows:

### **Left side – "Lab visit" proclet:**
- Begins with **Order entry** (initiated by a *doctor*)
- Flows to **Take blood sample** (performed by a *lab assistant*)
- Proceeds to **Receive result**  **Judge results**
- A decision point ("Everything fine") determines whether to:
  - **Send report** (end of process), or
  - **Do tests again**  **Receive updated result** (loop back)

### **Right side – "Lab test" proclet:**
- Begins with **Perform test** (by a *chemical analyst*)
- Flows to **Make report**
- Can lead to **Finish lab test** or loop through **Perform test again**  **Provide updated report**

### **Channels:**
- Two dashed-line channels (**Order system** and **HIS**) connect the two proclets, showing message exchanges with cardinality notations (1,1 and 1,*).

## (b) Class Diagram
A simple UML class diagram showing that **Lab visit** (1..1) **requires** one or more (1..*) **Lab tests**.

## (c) Example of a Performative
A table showing a sample message: at **11:00**, through the **Order system** channel, Lab visit-John sends a **Create** action to Lab test-HGB, requesting "Can you perform a HGB test for John?" with **Private** scope and **OUT** direction.
