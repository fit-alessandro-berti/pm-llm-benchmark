1) What’s wrong with the current model
- It over-permits order after approval:
  - Create Purchase Order is allowed in parallel with Receive Goods/Receive Invoice/Match/Pay, so goods or invoices could be received before the PO exists.
  - Match Invoice to PO can happen before either goods receipt or invoice receipt.
  - Pay Invoice can happen before receiving the invoice, before goods receipt, and before matching.
- Domain-wise dependencies that must be enforced:
  - Create PO must follow approval, and precede both goods receipt and invoice receipt.
  - Matching requires both the PO and the invoice (and, for 3-way match, also the goods receipt).
  - Payment must follow successful matching.
  - Close Case must be last.

2) Corrected process tree

A. Strict sequence (exactly as listed in the “standard logic”)
This enforces the precise 18 order: no reordering is possible.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Activities (same as provided)
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Strict, domain-ordered sequence
root = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.SEQUENCE,
    children=[
        create_req,
        approve_req,
        create_po,
        receive_goods,
        receive_invoice,
        match_invoice,
        pay_invoice,
        close_case
    ]
)
```

B. Realistic 3-way match variant (recommended in practice)
Allows Receive Goods and Receive Invoice to occur in any order, but still requires both to complete before matching and payment. Everything else remains strictly ordered.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Activities (same as provided)
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Concurrency only where appropriate: goods and invoice can arrive in either order
goods_and_invoice = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.PARALLEL,
    children=[receive_goods, receive_invoice]
)

root = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.SEQUENCE,
    children=[
        create_req,
        approve_req,
        create_po,
        goods_and_invoice,
        match_invoice,
        pay_invoice,
        close_case
    ]
)
```

3) Why this fixes the problem
- Prevents premature actions:
  - Create PO cannot be bypassed or interleaved with downstream steps; it must follow approval and precede goods/invoice.
  - Match cannot occur until both invoice and (for 3-way match) goods receipt are present.
  - Payment cannot occur before matching, eliminating “pay before receive” or “pay before invoice” behaviors.
- Enforces end-of-case discipline: Close Case only after payment (and thus after all prerequisite steps).
- Uses parallelism only where domain-appropriate:
  - Option A: forbids any reordering, matching the stated standard sequence.
  - Option B: permits the common real-life variability that goods and invoice can arrive in either order, while still enforcing that both are completed before matching and payment.

Choose A if you must mirror the exact listed order; choose B if you want the usual 3-way matching discipline with realistic ordering flexibility between goods and invoice receipt.
