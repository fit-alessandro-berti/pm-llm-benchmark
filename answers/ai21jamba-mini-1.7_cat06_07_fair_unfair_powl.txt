Here are the two POWL models reflecting the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. The first model includes the potential source of unfairness (XOR branching for community affiliation), while the second model removes this bias by ensuring a uniform cultural fit evaluation process:

### 1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness ("XOR Community Affiliation Check")**

This model retains the XOR branching where applicants with local community affiliations may receive a subjective uplift in their cultural fit evaluation.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
E = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
F = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define choices and loops
community_affiliation = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[
        StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[D, E, F, G, H]),  # Skill assessment + community affiliation check
        StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[D, F, G, H])      # Skill assessment + standard cultural fit check
    ]
)

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, B, C, community_affiliation])

# Set partial order
root.order.add_edge(A, B)
root.order.add_edge(B, C)
root.order.add_edge(C, D)
# Add XOR branches (community affiliation check influences subsequent steps)
root.order.add_edge(D, E)  # Community affiliation check after skill assessment
root.order.add_edge(E, F)  # Leads to community-influenced cultural fit check

# Concurrent execution for other paths
root.order.add_edge(D, F)  # Standard cultural fit check without community affiliation lift
root.order.add_edge(F, H)

# Finalize the POWL model
final_model = root
```

### 2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness ("Uniform Cultural Fit")**

This model removes the XOR branch that gives unfair advantages to applicants with community affiliations. All applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
F = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops and sequential execution
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, B, C, D, F, G, H])

# Set partial order
root.order.add_edge(A, B)
root.order.add_edge(B, C)
root.order.add_edge(C, D)  # Proceed to skill assessment
root.order.add_edge(D, F)  # Cultural fit check starts after skill assessment
root.order.add_edge(F, G)  # Cultural fit results fed into managerial review
root.order.add_edge(G, H)  # Managerial review leads to final decision

# Concurrent execution for other parts (e.g., loops for data completeness remain independent)
root.order.add_edge(B, D)  # Data completeness check can occur independently of skill assessment

# Finalize the POWL model
final_model = root
```

### Key Differences Between the Models:

1. **Community Affiliation Check (XOR Branching):**
	- In the first model (unfairness), after skill assessment, there’s a **choice point (XOR)**:
		- One branch checks community affiliation, which may negligibly uplift scores (introducing bias).
		- The other branch continues the standard cultural fit check without such adjustments.
	- In the second model, all applicants follow the **same cultural fit evaluation path**, eliminating this unfair advantage.
2. **Workflow Rules:**
	- The first model includes a **concurrent edge (D  E  F)** to allow the community affiliation check to influence the cultural fit evaluation.
	- The second model connects **D  F** directly, ensuring no additional advantage is granted based on community affiliation.
3. **Final Decision:**
	- Both models maintain the sequential steps for **managerial review and final hiring decisions**, ensuring no changes to the ultimate output but differing in the fairness of intermediate steps.
