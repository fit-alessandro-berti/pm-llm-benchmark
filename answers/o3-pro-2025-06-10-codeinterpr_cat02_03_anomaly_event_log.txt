Below is the normal, “text-book” Procure-to-Pay (P2P) sequence that most companies build their internal controls around:

1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve PR  
3. Issue / transmit Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Receive Goods or Services (Goods Receipt, GR)  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. 3-way/2-way Match (Invoice  PO  GR)  
7. Release / Execute Payment  
8. Close the case  

Controls are designed so that no activity that creates financial exposure (issuing a PO or paying a vendor) can take place before the preceding control steps have been fulfilled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ANOMALIES IN THE LOG
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Case 1001 – “Happy path”  
• All activities occur in the expected order.  
• No red flags.

-------------------------------------------------------
Case 1002 – Multiple control violations
-------------------------------------------------------
1. PO issued before PR is approved  
   • “Issue Purchase Order” appears only 10 minutes after the PR is created and **before** the “Approve Purchase Requisition” step (which happens two days later).  
   • Risk: bypasses the budget-checking/authorized-signatory control built into PR approval.

2. Invoice and Payment precede both Approval and Goods Receipt  
   • “Vendor Invoice Received” and “Release Payment” occur on 3 Feb, while PR approval and Goods Receipt occur later (4 Feb).  
   • Payment is released only 15 minutes after the invoice is logged—no time for 3-way match.  
   • Risks:  
     – Paying for goods that may never be received (cash-flow loss).  
     – Non-compliance with SOx / internal-control frameworks that require invoice approval and goods receipt before payment.

3. Match after Payment  
   • “Match Invoice to PO” is performed on 5 Feb, two days after the payment is already out the door.  
   • Audit issue: matching after payment defeats the purpose of the match.

-------------------------------------------------------
Case 1003 – Advance/early payment without controls
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Payment released before Invoice, GR, or Match  
   • “Release Payment” on 8 Feb; invoice arrives on 9 Feb; goods not received until 10 Feb.  
   • Unless this is an approved pre-payment arrangement, it violates standard policy that requires at least a 2-way match (PO–invoice) and, for tangible goods, a 3-way match including GR.  
   • Risks:  
     – Potential fraud or duplicate payment.  
     – Working-capital impact (company finances the vendor unnecessarily).  
     – If goods are damaged/never delivered, recovery may be difficult.

-------------------------------------------------------
Case 1004 – Goods received before a Purchase Order exists
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Goods Receipt precedes PO issuance  
   • “Receive Goods” on 6 Feb 09:00; “Issue Purchase Order” only 15 minutes later.  
   • Indicates either (a) “maverick buying” (the business ordered directly from the vendor without a PO) or (b) a back-dated entry to legitimize an after-the-fact delivery.  
   • Risks:  
     – Loss of pricing leverage and contract terms (no PO = no agreed price/conditions).  
     – Higher difficulty in enforcing returns, warranties, or service-level agreements.

2. Tight timing may suggest data-entry manipulation  
   • The tiny gap between GR and PO issue hints that the PO might have been entered retroactively to “clean up” the records, which auditors flag as a red flag for potential cover-ups.

-------------------------------------------------------
WHY THESE PATTERNS ARE PROBLEMATIC
-------------------------------------------------------
• Break embedded segregation-of-duties controls (approval before commitment, match before payment).  
• Increase exposure to fraud (paying fictitious or duplicate invoices).  
• Complicate month-end accruals and financial reporting (goods without PO, payments without liability).  
• Violate external compliance requirements (SOx 404, EU Anti-Fraud directives, ISO-compliant purchasing policies).  
• Deteriorate supplier-relationship data accuracy (delivery dates, lead-time KPIs, etc.).

-------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
-------------------------------------------------------
• Case 1001: conforms to best practice.  
• Case 1002: PO before approval, payment before receipt & match – high risk.  
• Case 1003: early/advance payment before invoice & goods – medium-to-high risk unless explicitly authorized.  
• Case 1004: goods arrive before PO – maverick buying / retroactive PO entry – medium risk and audit finding.

Each flagged sequence should be investigated to confirm whether it was an exceptional, approved scenario (e.g., prepaid software licenses) or a breakdown in controls that needs remediation.
