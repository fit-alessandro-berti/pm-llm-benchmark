```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  event_log
WHERE
  case_id IN (
    SELECT
      case_id
    FROM
      event_log
    GROUP BY
      case_id
    HAVING
      COUNT(*) <= 6
  );
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Inner Query (Subquery):**
    *   `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id`: This part groups the events by `case_id` and selects each unique `case_id`.
    *   `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`: This clause filters these grouped results. `COUNT(*)` counts the number of rows (events) within each `case_id` group. The `HAVING` clause keeps only those `case_id`s where the total event count is less than or equal to 6.

2.  **Outer Query:**
    *   `SELECT * FROM event_log`: This selects all columns (`*`) from the original `event_log` table.
    *   `WHERE case_id IN (...)`: This is the main filter applied to the original events. It checks if the `case_id` of each event is present in the list of `case_id`s returned by the inner subquery (which are the cases with 6 or fewer events).

The result is the complete set of event rows belonging *only* to the cases that satisfied the count condition in the subquery.
