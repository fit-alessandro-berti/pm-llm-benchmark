```

**Reasoning**:

- **Matching Events with Timestamp Tolerance**:

- The initial timestamp difference tolerance was set at **2 seconds**.
- If two events from different logs had order_id and timestamps within this threshold, the events were merged.

- **Event Mappings and Naming Resolutions**:
- `OrderReceived` (System B) corresponds to `Order Received` (System A).
- `OrderValidation` (System B) corresponds to `Order Validated` (System A).
- The `Quality Check` event was only in System B, retained separately within the merged log.
- System B used the label `PaymentCheck`, and with the closest event type in System A being `Payment Processed`, these were merged considering the user_id and event nature.

- **Timestamp Management**:
- Conflicts were resolved with System B timestamps for merged events, assuming they capture the action initiation over System A’s reception time.
- The `Item Delivered` event, unique to System A and outside the matching window, remained separate.

**Final Notes**:

- The merged log follows the timestamps from System B where records align, providing initiation timing preference.
- Attributes like user_id and resource_id are directly sourced from System B's richer set.
- Additional events are tagged with originating system annotations to maintain auditing clarity.
- The chronological order presents events as they would logically unfold in the combined workflow, utilizing the most informative record.
