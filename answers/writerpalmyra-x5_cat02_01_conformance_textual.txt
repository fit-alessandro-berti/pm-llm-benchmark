Based on the provided **normative process description** and the **event log**, I’ve analyzed each case for adherence to the intended flow. The key rules derived from the text are:

###  Core Sequential Constraints:
1. **"Check inventory" must come immediately after "Receive order"** and before any decision path.
2. **"Authorize payment" must come *after* "Check inventory"** and only if inventory is sufficient.
3. **"Package items" must come after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order"**.
4. **If "Cancel order" occurs, then "Package items" and "Ship order" must *not* follow.**
5. **"Ship order" must *only* occur after "Package items" and never after "Cancel order".**
6. **"Close order" must always be the final activity in every case.**

Now, evaluating each **Case**:

###  **Case 1**  
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close

- Follows the full fulfillment path.
- All steps in correct order.
- No violations.

 **Compliant**

---

###  **Case 2**  
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  **Package  Authorize  Ship  Close**

- Inventory was checked first — good.
- But **"Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment"** — this is a **violation**.
- According to the normative description: *"payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known… [and] packaging must come after authorization."*
- Packaging before authorization bypasses financial validation — risk of packaging items without confirmed payment.

 **Violation**: **"Package items" before "Authorize payment"**  
 Breaks the dependency: payment must be authorized before preparing shipment.

---

###  **Case 3**  
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel  Ship  Close**

- After "Authorize payment", the process takes a sharp turn: it **cancels the order**, yet still proceeds to **ship** and close.
- Once "Cancel order" occurs, **no fulfillment activities should follow**.
- Especially problematic: **"Ship order" occurs *after* cancellation** — this contradicts the directive: *"it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment... such as packaging or shipping" after cancellation.*
- Additionally, canceling *after* authorizing payment may imply a business exception, but **shipping after cancellation is unacceptable** under the rules as stated.

 **Violations**:
1. **"Ship order" after "Cancel order"** — strictly forbidden.
2. Possibly premature cancellation after authorization (might be a business decision), but **shipping post-cancellation is indefensible** in the normative model.

---

###  **Case 4**  
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

- Inventory insufficient  triggers cancellation path.
- No payment authorization, no packaging, no shipping — correct.
- "Close order" ends the process — appropriate.
- All expected behaviors for a cancellation scenario.

 **Compliant**

---

###  **Case 5**  
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship  Close**

- Missing **"Package items"** entirely.
- "Ship order" occurs without preceding "Package items".
- The norm states: *"Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'."*
- Thus, **skipping packaging before shipping** is a **clear violation**.

 **Violation**: **"Ship order" without prior "Package items"**  
 Violates process logic: you can't ship something that hasn’t been packaged.

###  Summary of Violations

| Case ID | Compliant? | Violation Description |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| 1      |  Yes     | None — correct fulfillment path |
| 2      |  No      | **"Package items" before "Authorize payment"** — violates sequencing dependency |
| 3      |  No      | **"Ship order" after "Cancel order"** — logically invalid; cancellation should block fulfillment |
| 4      |  Yes     | None — correct cancellation path |
| 5      |  No      | **"Ship order" without "Package items"** — missing required step before shipping |

---

###  Final Answer:

**Violating Cases: 2, 3, and 5**

#### **Case 2 Violation**:  
- **Improper order of operations**: Items are packaged *before* payment is authorized.  
- This contradicts the rule that authorization must precede packaging, as financial approval should be confirmed before allocating resources to fulfillment.

#### **Case 3 Violation**:  
- **Logical contradiction**: After canceling the order, the system still ships it.  
- Once canceled, fulfillment activities like shipping are invalid. Even if payment was authorized earlier, shipping post-cancellation violates the process integrity.

#### **Case 5 Violation**:  
- **Missing activity**: "Package items" is skipped entirely before shipping.  
- Packaging is a necessary precondition to shipping, per the normative flow. Its absence makes the shipping step non-compliant.

Only **Cases 1 and 4** follow the intended branching logic and sequencing rules correctly.
