###  **Rationale for Added Constraints to Reduce Bias**

1. **`coexistence` between sensitive decisions and `ManualReview`:**
   - Added: `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`, `Approve_Female`, `Reject_Female` must coexist with `ManualReview`.
   - **Why?** Ensures that any decision involving applicants from protected groups (e.g., minority race, female gender) is accompanied by a manual review. This introduces a mandatory oversight step, reducing the risk of automated or unconscious bias in decisions. It enforces consistency and accountability in high-risk cases.

2. **`response` from sensitive attribute checks to `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - Added: `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge` must be followed by `BiasMitigationCheck`.
   - **Why?** Prevents direct decision-making after sensitive attribute disclosure. By requiring a "bias mitigation" step (e.g., anonymization, audit, or fairness review), the process forces a pause before decisions are made, reducing the chance of biased interpretation of sensitive data.

3. **`succession` from `BiasMitigationCheck` to `FinalDecision`:**
   - Added: `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede `FinalDecision`.
   - **Why?** Ensures that no final decision is made without first undergoing a fairness-aware review. This enforces a procedural safeguard that prevents rushed or biased outcomes, especially when sensitive attributes are involved.

4. **`nonsuccession` between sensitive attribute checks and `Reject`:**
   - Added: `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge` **cannot** directly precede `Reject`.
   - **Why?** This directly blocks the most dangerous pattern: rejecting an applicant immediately after seeing their sensitive attribute (e.g., race or gender). Such immediate succession is a strong indicator of bias. By forbidding it, the model enforces a temporal buffer, requiring intermediate checks or reasoning steps.

###  **Summary: How These Constraints Reduce Bias**

- **Proactive Oversight:** The model now mandates a `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` for sensitive cases, ensuring human or algorithmic fairness checks.
- **Temporal Separation:** By inserting required intermediate steps (`BiasMitigationCheck`) and forbidding direct `sensitive_event  reject`, the model disrupts patterns that correlate sensitive attributes with immediate negative outcomes.
- **Enforcement of Fairness by Design:** These constraints embed fairness into the process logic, not just as a post-hoc audit but as a structural requirement.

These additions transform the loan application process from one that could be vulnerable to bias into a more equitable, auditable, and transparent system—aligning with ethical AI and fair decision-making principles.
