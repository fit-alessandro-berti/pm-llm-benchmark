## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics Using Process Mining

### **A. Process Mining Reconstructing Shop Floor Operations**
Process mining techniques (e.g., **PetriNet Discovery**, **log-based process discovery**, **conformance checking**) can extract the *actual* workflow from the MES event logs. This allows us to reconstruct the *as-is* process model for all jobs and tasks across the shop floor, including:

- **Job and Task Flows:** Mapping the real sequence of events for each job (from release to completion), including task order, resource allocation, and delays.
- **Resource Utilization Paths:** Visualizing how jobs move through machines (e.g., CUT-01  MILL-03  GRIND-02), and where they wait or are delayed.
- **Task and Machine Sequences:** Identifying the precise points where sequence-dependent setups occur (e.g., when a new job starts on CUT-01 after a prior job with different material properties).
- **Timing Metrics Extraction:**
    - **Task Durations and Setups:** By analyzing event timestamps, we can compute *actual* task durations (planned vs. real), setup times (especially sequence-dependent), and idle times.
    - **Queue Times:** Measuring time spent in queues before machine availability (e.g., CUT-01 backlog).
    - **Lead Time Distribution:** From job release to completion, including all handoffs and delays.
    - **Makespan Distribution:** The total shop floor cycle time for each order.
    - **Tardiness:** Quantifying late job arrivals by comparing completion times to due dates extracted from the logs.
    - **WIP Levels:** By tracking the number of jobs in each work center at any timepoint (using event timestamps and state transitions).

### **B. Key Performance Metrics from Process Mining**

#### **1. Machine and Resource Utilization**
- **Productive vs. Non-productive Time:** By tagging events as "processing" vs. "idle" for each machine operator.
- **Setup Time Analysis:** For each machine/job sequence pair, calculate the distribution of setup times (e.g., via clustering of time intervals between release of consecutive jobs on the same machine).
    - *Example:* If jobs starting with aluminum always have a 10-minute setup on CUT-01 but 28 minutes for steel, this is captured via event time intervals.
- **Throughput and Bottlenecks:** Identify machines with 90%+ utilization and downstream bottlenecks using control-flow path analysis (e.g., MILL-03 is always idle when CUT-01 is busy).

#### **2. Task and Job Flow Metrics**
- **Queue Lengths and Waiting Times:** For each work center, compute the average time a job spends waiting before starting processing.
- **Job Delay Statistics:** Quantify how often jobs miss their due dates by how much, and correlate with task or resource constraints.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Impact:** Measure the variance in setup times depending on the predecessor job (using regression or clustering over time series of setup events).

#### **3. Priority and Urgency Effects**
- **Priority-Weighted Flow Analysis:** Use priority labels to trace if high-priority jobs are delayed disproportionately due to suboptimal dispatching (e.g., always assigned to idle machines, or forced through bottlenecks).
- **Due Date Violations:** Correlate job priorities with actual vs. expected completion times using process mining’s timing metrics.

#### **4. Disruption Impact Analysis**
- **Breakdown Frequency and Duration:** Using event logs, quantify the frequency, timing, and downstream impact of machine breakdowns (e.g., how often does a breakdown at MILL-02 trigger delays in downstream tasks?).
- **Urgent Order Handling:** Analyze if “high priority” jobs are given preferential but still delayed due to insufficient resources or poor sequencing.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies (Process Mining Evidence)

### **A. Bottleneck Identification and Impact**
- **Bottleneck Detection:** Using control-flow and resource-path mining, machines like MILL-03 (with long queue times) or CUT-01 (with frequent setups) are flagged as bottlenecks.
    - *Example:* If 40% of all jobs wait >60 minutes before starting MILL-03, this is a clear bottleneck.
- **Throughput Bottleneck Analysis:** Compare cycle times and WIP at each stage using the **bottleneck index** (Bottleneck Ratio = (Cycle Time at bottleneck / Average Lead Time across all stages)).

### **B. Inefficient Task Prioritization and Due Date Violations**
- **Priority vs. Completion Analysis:** Jobs with higher priority are analyzed to see if they are delayed more than expected, indicating flawed dispatching rules.
    - *Process Mining Approach:* Correlate priority codes with completion time and tardiness, using statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared for delay vs. priority groups).
- **Due Date Violation Patterns:** Plot a histogram of tardiness versus job priority/due date to identify systemic issues (e.g., medium-priority jobs always late).

### **C. Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Times**
- **Sequence Dependency Analysis:** Using **variant mining**, compare the setup times for different job sequences at the same machine. 
    - *Example:* If job A followed by job B has a 15-minute setup vs. 25 minutes when job B precedes A, the system may be failing to account for optimal sequence.
- **Cumulative Setup Time Impact:** Trace the effect of poor sequencing on total job lead time by modeling the “setup chain” effect through the workflow.

### **D. Resource Contention and Starvation**
- **Contention Analysis:** Model resource allocation using **resource usage graphs** to detect periods where machines are under-utilized (starvation) or overloaded (overutilization).
    - *Example:* If CUT-01 is often idle while CUT-02 is overloaded due to dispatching rules, this reveals suboptimal load balancing.
- **Starvation Detection:** Identify jobs that are perpetually delayed due to upstream bottlenecks or poor balancing.

### **E. WIP Inflations and Bullwhip Effects**
- **WIP Fluctuations:** Time-series analysis of WIP at each work center using process mining to detect spikes, especially downstream of bottlenecks.
- **Upstream Variance Propagation:** Use “flow balance” analysis to see if small upstream variations cause large downstream WIP increases (bullwhip).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### **A. Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules**
- **Static vs. Dynamic Environment:** Current rules are not adaptive to real-time conditions (e.g., machine breakdowns, changing priorities, uncertain task durations).
    - *Evidence from Mining:* If logs show that dispatching by arrival time alone leads to 30% of jobs missing their due dates when machines become available, this demonstrates the flaw.
- **Neglect of Sequence-Dependent Setup:** Rules ignore or oversimplify the impact of prior jobs on setup times, leading to inefficient use of machines.

### **B. Lack of Real-Time Visibility and Planning**
- **No Live State Awareness:** Current systems don’t provide real-time dashboards for WIP, machine status, or task progress, so dispatchers are reactive.
    - *Process Mining Insight:* Historical logs can be mined to show how reactive firefighting (e.g., responding to breakdowns) contributes to missed deadlines.

### **C. Inaccurate Task Duration and Setup Estimation**
- **Planned vs. Actual Times:** If process mining reveals that planned durations are consistently optimistic (e.g., 90% of tasks finish 20% faster or slower than planned), this impacts scheduling accuracy.
    - *Root Cause:* Underestimation of setup times, unknown material changes, or operator skill variance.

### **D. Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups**
- **Setup Time Underestimation:** If the system doesn’t account for material-specific or job-sequence setups, it overestimates the ability to batch or parallelize jobs, causing delays.

### **E. Poor Coordination and Disruption Management**
- **Breakdowns as Crises:** If process mining shows that 15% of tasks are delayed due to unplanned breakdowns and these are handled ad hoc (not scheduled around), this leads to chronic instability.
- **Urgent Jobs:** If high-priority jobs are delayed because there’s no protocol for interrupting the sequence or reallocating resources, the system is not robust to change.

#### **How Process Mining Distinguishes Root Causes**
- **Correlation Analysis:** By linking event logs with KPIs (e.g., does high setup variance at CUT-01 coincide with high tardiness?), we can isolate whether the problem is scheduling, sequencing, or resource capacity.
- **Causal Modeling:** Using process mining’s event logs, we can build decision trees or causal models to infer whether a delay at step X causes downstream problems at Y.

## 4. Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic, Sequence-Aware, Priority-Adaptive Dispatching (Multi-Objective Scheduling)**

#### **Core Logic**
- **Rule:** At each work center, jobs are assigned based on a weighted scoring function considering:
    - **Due Date:** Penalties for missing deadlines.
    - **Priority:** Higher-priority jobs get preference, but not at the expense of feasibility.
    - **Remaining Process Time:** Shorter jobs first (to reduce queueing).
    - **Downstream Bottlenecks:** Avoid assigning jobs that would block critical path machines.
    - **Estimated Setup Time:** For the *sequence-dependent* setup on the next machine, use historical data (mined via process mining) to predict the additional time required based on the previous job on that machine.
    - **Machine Availability Forecast:** Incorporate near-term machine uptime predictions (if derived from maintenance logs).

#### **How Process Mining Informs This Strategy**
- **Historical Precedence Data:** Mining reveals the most common job sequences on each machine and their associated setup times. This allows building a lookup table or predictive model (e.g., via regression or ML) for setup time based on the last job.
- **Queue and Bottleneck Analysis:** Process mining can model current queue lengths and machine utilization to avoid overloading critical machines.
- **Priority-Weighted Queuing:** The rules can be tuned using optimization (e.g., maximizing “on-time delivery” while minimizing “WIP”).

#### **Impact on KPIs**
- **Reduces Tardiness:** By avoiding last-minute rush or blocking bottlenecks.
- **Lowers WIP:** Prioritizes flow through the line, reducing backlog.
- **Improves Utilization:** Balances loads across machines by considering both current load and future demand.

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Machine Learning and Proactive Bottleneck Management**

#### **Core Logic**
- **Forecasting Workloads:** Use time-series and classification models (trained on historical logs mined by process mining) to predict:
    - Job arrival rates for the next 24-48 hours.
    - Machine breakdown probabilities and durations.
    - Task duration and setup time distributions for each job (considering material, complexity, and prior job sequence).
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** The system continuously re-plans the schedule every few minutes/hours, shifting tasks to avoid predicted bottlenecks and account for unplanned disruptions (e.g., hot jobs or breakdowns).
    - *Example:* If a machine is predicted to break down in the next hour, jobs assigned to it are preempted and reassigned to alternative machines with available capacity.

#### **How Process Mining Informs This Strategy**
- **Training Data:** Historical logs with failures, task durations, and setups are used to train prediction models.
- **Scenario Simulation:** Process mining can generate synthetic “what-if” scenarios (e.g., what if a hot job arrives, or a machine fails) to stress-test the predictive model.
- **Feedback Loop:** Actual outcomes are compared to predictions to iteratively improve model accuracy.

#### **Impact on KPIs**
- **Lower Tardiness and Lead Time Variance:** Proactive rescheduling mitigates delays before they occur.
- **Improved Resilience:** Less disruption impact due to early detection of issues.
- **Reduced WIP:** Predictive rescheduling allows for smoother flow and fewer buffer buildup events.

---

### **Strategy 3: Sequence-Optimized and Batching for Setup Time Reduction (Setup Minimization Scheduling)**

#### **Core Logic**
- **Job Sequencing at Bottlenecks:** For machines with high sequence-dependent setups (e.g., CUT-01), use optimization algorithms to find the optimal job order that minimizes total setup time (and thus total cycle time).
    - *Approach:* Formulate as a scheduling/sequencing problem (e.g., a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem or Integer Linear Programming) where the objective is to minimize the cumulative setup time across the workflow.
- **Batching Similar Jobs:** Group jobs with similar material properties or processing needs to exploit reduced setup times when switching between them (if historical data supports this).
- **Dynamic Reordering:** Periodically re-optimize the sequence of jobs on high-bottleneck machines based on real-time task progress and remaining time.

#### **How Process Mining Informs This Strategy**
- **Historical Setup Time Analysis:** Process mining uncovers the distribution of setup times for different job sequences, enabling the creation of a cost function for setup penalty.
- **Identifying Batch Candidates:** Mining can highlight groups of jobs with similar sequences or material types that benefit from reduced setup times when grouped.
- **Feedback and Adaptation:** By monitoring real-time setup times and comparing to the predicted model, the system can dynamically adjust the sequence if deviations occur (e.g., unexpected material change).

#### **Impact on KPIs**
- **Significant Setup Time Reduction:** Especially at machines with high setup variability.
- **Faster Cycle Times:** Less time spent on setups translates directly to shorter job lead times.
- **Lower Tardiness:** Faster throughput means less risk of missing due dates.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### **A. Simulation for Strategy Testing and Optimization**

#### **Approach: Discrete-Event Simulation**
- **Data Extraction for Models:** Use process mining to extract:
    - Task duration distributions (mean, variance).
    - Sequence-dependent setup time matrices.
    - Machine and operator availability profiles.
    - Failure and priority event frequencies.
- **Model Construction:** Build a digital twin of the shop floor using these data.
- **Scenario Testing:**
    - Baseline: Current dispatching rules.
    - Strategy 1: Dynamic, sequence-aware dispatching.
    - Strategy 2: Predictive scheduling with ML.
    - Strategy 3: Sequence-optimized batching.
    - Edge Cases: High load, multiple breakdowns, urgent jobs, material mix changes.
- **KPI Metrics in Simulation:** 
    - Average lead time, max/min job delay, WIP at each station, machine utilization, setup time per job.
    - Tardiness rates under varying demand and disruption patterns.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Use statistical tests to compare strategies for effectiveness and robustness.

### **B. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptive Scheduling (Closed-Loop System)**

#### **Process Mining for Monitoring**
- **Real-Time Data Feeds:** Integrate MES event logs with real-time streaming for continuous process mining (e.g., streaming process mining).
- **KPI Tracking:** Monitor on-the-fly metrics (WIP, queue lengths, machine utilization, tardiness) using process mining dashboards.
- **Feedback Loop:** When performance degrades (e.g., sudden increase in tardiness or WIP), trigger automated re-evaluation of the scheduling strategy using updated process models.

#### **Adaptive Scheduling Mechanisms**
- **Re-optimization:** When deviations from the plan exceed thresholds (detected via process mining), the scheduling algorithm re-optimizes using updated data (e.g., new failure probabilities, changing material properties).
- **Automated Work Instructions:** If mining identifies a new best sequence for a bottleneck machine, rules can be updated or even machine parameters adjusted (e.g., reordering tooling for reduced setup).
- **Proactive Breakdown Management:** Use predictive maintenance insights (from process mining’s failure analysis) to preemptively schedule maintenance or reroute jobs.
