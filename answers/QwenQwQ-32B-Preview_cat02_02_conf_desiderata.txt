Alright, I've got this task to analyze an event log for a loan application process. There are some strict rules that must always be followed, and some recommendations that are nice to follow but not mandatory. My job is to look at the event log and identify where these rules are being broken or where the recommendations are not being met.

First, I need to make sure I understand the strict rules, which are the normative process behaviors. The process always starts with receiving a loan application. After that, a credit check must be performed before any risk evaluation. So, credit check comes before risk assessment. Then, based on the risk assessment, a loan decision is made—either approved or rejected. After the decision, the applicant must be informed. If the loan is approved, there's an extra step: finalizing documentation before closing the case. But if it's rejected, you just close the case without finalizing documentation.

So, the sequence is:

1. Application Received

2. Credit Check

3. Risk Assessment

4. Loan Decision

5. Inform Applicant

6. If Approved, Finalize Documentation

7. Close Case

And there are some specific rules:

- Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment.

- Risk Assessment before Loan Decision.

- Inform Applicant after Loan Decision.

- If approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case.

- If rejected, don't finalize documentation before closing the case.

Alright, now looking at the event log:

**Case 1:**

- 2024-01-10 09:00: Application Received

- 2024-01-10 09:30: Credit Check

- 2024-01-10 10:00: Risk Assessment

- 2024-01-10 11:00: Loan Decision (Approved)

- 2024-01-10 13:00: Inform Applicant

- 2024-01-10 13:30: Finalize Documentation

- 2024-01-10 14:00: Close Case

This seems to follow the sequence perfectly. Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, Inform Applicant after Loan Decision, Finalize Documentation before Close Case, and since it was approved, all steps are there.

**Case 2:**

- 2024-01-11 08:00: Application Received

- 2024-01-11 08:20: Risk Assessment

- 2024-01-11 09:00: Credit Check

- 2024-01-11 09:30: Loan Decision (Rejected)

- 2024-01-11 10:00: Finalize Documentation

- 2024-01-11 10:30: Close Case

Hmm, here there are two issues.

First, Risk Assessment is before Credit Check, but according to the rules, Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment. So, that's a violation of the normative process.

Second, even though the loan was rejected, they still finalized documentation, which is not allowed. So, that's another violation.

**Case 3:**

- 2024-01-12 09:00: Application Received

- 2024-01-14 10:00: Credit Check

- 2024-01-14 11:00: Risk Assessment

- 2024-01-14 12:00: Loan Decision (Approved)

- 2024-01-16 15:00: Inform Applicant

- 2024-01-17 09:00: Finalize Documentation

- 2024-01-17 10:00: Close Case

In this case, the sequence seems correct: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, Inform Applicant after Loan Decision, Finalize Documentation before Close Case. But there are some timing issues.

First, the Credit Check happened on the 12th at 09:00, and then on the 14th at 10:00. That's more than 24 hours later, which is not ideal, but since it's a desideratum, not a hard rule, it's not a serious violation.

Second, Inform Applicant was at 16:00 on the 16th, which is more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision at 12:00 on the 14th. Again, not ideal, but just a desideratum.

Also, there's no Follow-up Call, but since it's recommended but not required, it's not a problem.

So, for normative rules, only Case 2 has violations. Case 3 has some timing issues that are just recommendations.

Now, for part 2, the desiderata:

- It's preferred that Credit Check is completed within 24 hours after receiving the application.

- Inform Applicant should be done within 48 hours after the Loan Decision.

- It's encouraged to perform a Follow-up Call before closing the case, but it's not mandatory.

So, in Case 1, everything seems timely, and there's no mention of a Follow-up Call, but since it's not required, it's okay.

In Case 2, no issues with timing, but sequence violations.

In Case 3, Credit Check was more than 24 hours after Application Received, and Inform Applicant was more than 48 hours after Loan Decision. So, these are desideratum violations.

No Follow-up Call in Case 3, but again, it's not required.

So, summarizing:

**Normative Rule Violations:**

- Case 2:

  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check.

  - Finalized documentation after rejection.

**Desideratum Violations:**

- Case 3:

  - Credit Check more than 24 hours after Application Received.

  - Inform Applicant more than 48 hours after Loan Decision.

  - No Follow-up Call, but this is not a problem since it's not required.

Now, for interpretations or justifications:

For Case 2, the sequence violations might be due to human error or perhaps system issues where activities were recorded in the wrong order. The finalization of documentation after rejection could be a mistake or perhaps an attempt to keep the applicant engaged, but it's against the rules.

For Case 3, the delays could be due to busy staff, backend processing times, or perhaps waiting for additional information from the applicant. Since these are just recommendations, it's understandable, but ideally, they should aim to meet these time frames.

Overall, the process seems mostly followed, with only one case having serious violations and another having some minor timing issues.
