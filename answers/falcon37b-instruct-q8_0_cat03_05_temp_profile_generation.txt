This Python dictionary represents the temporal profile for the high-tech electronics supply chain process. Each key is a tuple of activity labels, and each value is a tuple containing the average time in seconds and the standard deviation in seconds between those activities. The provided estimates are hypothetical and are meant to illustrate the format rather than reflect actual data.
