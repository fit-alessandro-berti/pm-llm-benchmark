Here is an example of how you can create a ProcessTree in pm4py for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:
```
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root node
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Create the leaf nodes (activities)
place_order = ProcessTree(label="place_order", parent=root)
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="receive_invoice", parent=root)
approve_invoice = ProcessTree(label="approve_invoice", parent=root)
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="pay_invoice", parent=root)
cancel_order = ProcessTree(label="cancel_order", parent=root)

# Create the non-leaf nodes (sequence, xor, parallel)
sequence_steps = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
sequence_compare_received_approved = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
sequence_approve_pay_cancel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)

# Set the leaf nodes as children of the non-leaf nodes
sequence_steps.children.append( sequence_compare_received_approved )
sequence_steps.children.append( place_order )
receive_invoice.parent = sequence_compare_received_approved
approve_invoice.parent = sequence_compare_received_approved
sequence_approve_pay_cancel.children.append( approve_invoice )
sequence_approve_pay_cancel.children.append( pay_invoice )
sequence_approve_pay_cancel.children.append( cancel_order )
sequence_compare_received_approved.children.append( receive_invoice )
sequence_compare_received_approved.children.append( sequence_approve_pay_cancel )
root.children.append(sequence_steps)
root.children.append(sequence_approve_pay_cancel)
```
This code creates a process tree that represents the following steps:

1. `place_order`: Place an order
2. `receive_invoice`: Receive an invoice
3. `approve_invoice`: Approve the invoice
4. `pay_invoice`: Pay the invoice
5. `cancel_order`: Cancel the order

The process tree is constructed as follows:

* The `root` node is a parallel operator, which means that two separate sequences can execute concurrently.
* The `sequence_steps` node is a sequence operator, which means that the steps inside it must be executed in order.
* The `sequence_compare_received_approved` node is a sequence operator that checks if the invoice has been received and approved.
* The `sequence_approve_pay_cancel` node is a sequence operator that approves or pays the invoice, or cancels the order.
* The `place_order` node is a leaf activity (an "X" node).
* The `receive_invoice` node is a leaf activity
