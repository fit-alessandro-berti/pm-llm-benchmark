## 1. **Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

**A. Event Log Metrics for Agent and Tier Performance**

To understand how resources—individual agents and support tiers—are performing, the event log will be mined for the following key metrics:

- **Workload Distribution**:  
  - *Number of tickets handled per agent/tier over time*
  - *Peak and idle periods by agent/tier (heatmaps across shifts, days of the week)*

- **Processing Times**:  
  - *Average and median time spent by each agent/tier on each activity (e.g., diagnosis, resolution, escalation, assignment)*
  - *Ticket ‘touch time’ vs. total ‘ticket clock time’ per tier/agent*

- **First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1**:  
  - *% of tickets resolved by L1 without escalation*
  - *Breakdown by ticket category, required skill, and priority*

- **Skill-Ticket Matching**:  
  - *How frequently agents handle tickets that match their skill set vs. out-of-skill assignments*

- **Reassignment and Escalation Frequency**:  
  - *Average number of agent handovers per ticket*
  - *% of tickets requiring multiple assignments vs. single handler tickets*

- **Categorical Analysis**:  
  - *Which categories and required skills are handled by which agents/tiers*
  - *Profile of tickets that result in escalation or SLA breach*

**B. Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Patterns:**

- **Resource Interaction & Social Network Analysis (SNA):**
  - *‘Handover of Work’ networks:* Show which agents/tiers pass tickets to whom, and at what frequency—highlighting excessive loops, bottlenecks, or unusual escalation flows.
  - *Cluster analysis:* Reveal informal workgroups, shadow roles, or cross-tier interaction patterns.

- **Role Discovery:**
  - *Compare actual vs. intended resource roles:* Are L2 specialists spending significant time on basic tasks? Are some agents informally acting as skill ‘hubs’ (handling reassignments or acting as peer escalators)?
  - *Frequent pattern mining:* Are certain sequences of assignment or escalation more common for specific categories/skills?

- **Conformance Checking:**
  - *Compare actual assignment and escalation processes with the designed process (e.g., proper L1->L2/L3 transitions, skill checks prior to assignment). Identify rule violations or frequent deviations.*

**C. Skill Utilization Analysis:**

- **Skill Assignment Matrix:**
  - *Construct a matrix crossing ‘ticket required skills’ vs. ‘agent actual skills used’ to measure:*
       - *Underutilization of specialized skills (specialists spending time on generic tasks)*
       - *Mismatch of assignments (tickets requiring skills not present in the assigned agent, leading to escalation)*
  - *Proficiency-weighted analysis:* Are tickets routed to the most qualified available agents, or just ‘anyone with the skill listed’?

## 2. **Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

Using the above analyses, process mining can pinpoint the following issues:

**A. Bottlenecks Due to Skill Gaps:**
- *Identify ticket types or skills that have high queue/wait times, indicating shortage or misallocation of appropriately skilled agents.*
- *Process maps (‘Directly-Follows Graphs’) showing congestion points (e.g., tickets waiting for L2/L3 with rare skills).*

**B. Delays from Escalation/Reassignment:**
- *Calculate the average time lost per escalation or reassignment.*
- *‘Rework loops’ visualized in process models showing tickets bouncing between L1, L2, or multiple agents before resolution.*

**C. Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
- *Cases where initial dispatcher/L1 assignments are followed quickly by transfer/escalation, especially if the first agent lacks the required skill*, suggesting initial categorization or assignment failures.

**D. Agent/Team Performance Outliers:**
- *Agents with consistently long ticket handling times, higher-than-average escalations, or disproportionate workloads.*
- *Teams with high idle time relative to ticket influx (underutilization).*

**E. SLA Breach Correlation:**
- *Analyze which resource assignment sequences (e.g., tickets passing through three agents, or with multiple skill mismatches) correlate strongly with SLA breaches.*
- *Calculate % of breached tickets involving:*
     - *Multiple reassignments*
     - *Assignment to agents without needed skills*
     - *Assignments during known peak workload times (overloaded agents)*

## 3. **Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

Using the problems identified, process mining enables data-driven root cause analysis by:

**A. Assignment Rule Deficiencies:**
- *Round-robin or manual assignment, as evidenced by frequent non-skill-aligned routing, leads to unnecessary escalations and rework.*
- *Frequent ‘back-and-forth’ flow in process model variants (e.g., L1L2L1L2) suggests rule or training gaps.*

**B. Incomplete Agent Skill Profiles:**
- *Tickets repeatedly escalated due to apparent ‘missing skill’ hint at inaccurate or outdated skill documentation in agent profiles.*

**C. Poor Ticket Categorization:**
- *Patterns where tickets are recategorized post-assignment or quickly escalated on first touch may indicate front-end misclassification.*

**D. Lack of Real-Time Load Visibility:**
- *If agents consistently overloaded while others are idle, it’s likely assignment decisions don’t consider real-time availability.*

**E. L1 Empowerment/Training Gaps:**
- *Low first-call resolution (FCR) at L1, compared to peers or best practice benchmarks, especially on certain ticket types.*

**Variant Analysis & Decision Mining:**
- *Split tickets into ‘smooth’ vs. ‘choppy’ variants (few vs. many handovers).*
- *Use decision mining to uncover which ticket features/contexts (e.g., certain skills, channels, workload states) are predictive of escalations and delayed resolution.*

## 4. **Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based, Proficiency-Aware Assignment Engine**

- **Issue Addressed:**  
  - Tickets being routed to agents without required skills, resulting in reassignments, escalations, delay, and SLA breaches.

- **Insight Leveraged:**  
  - Process mining shows high correlation between skill-mismatched assignments and rework loops.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Build/verify an up-to-date, granular agent skill matrix (including proficiency levels and recency of experience).
  - Use this matrix for automated assignment: tickets are matched to the most skilled available agent in the appropriate tier, prioritizing higher proficiency and recency of relevant ticket handling.
  - Fallback to less-proficient but available agents only if no optimal resource is available.

- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Current and accurate agent skill profiles with proficiency levels, agent availability and workload data, and consistent ‘Required Skill’ ticket attributes.

- **Expected Benefits:**  
  - Fewer skill-based escalations.
  - Reduced resolution and handover times.
  - Improved SLA compliance.

### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware, Dynamic Assignment Balancing**

- **Issue Addressed:**  
  - Uneven distribution of tickets, some agents overloaded/pathways bottlenecked.

- **Insight Leveraged:**  
  - Workload imbalance and underutilization/overload revealed in process mining dashboards.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Integrate real-time data on active ticket queues, in-progress tasks, and estimated agent capacity.
  - Route new assignments to agents not only by skill match but also by lowest current or forecasted workload.
  - Consider adaptive resourcing (e.g., temporarily cross-tier assigning skilled L1 agents to supplement L2 for overflow in peak times).

- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Real-time and historical workload data per agent, active ticket tracking, agent skill matrix.

- **Expected Benefits:**  
  - Smoother workloads, fewer tickets awaiting attention, less agent burnout.
  - Higher throughput with existing staff.

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Skill Requirement & Assignment Optimization**

- **Issue Addressed:**  
  - Misclassification and poor initial matching, with L1/dispatchers often unable to reliably assign to the correct skill profile.

- **Insight Leveraged:**  
  - Historical event log mining reveals patterns in ticket attributes (category, keywords, description) predictive of skill required and escalation likelihood.

- **Implementation:**  
  - Use machine learning models (trained on event log, ticket resolution, and escalation outcomes) to predict required skills and ticket complexity at intake.
  - Guide or automate assignments based on these predictions rather than generic category only.
  - Provide dynamic guidance for dispatchers and L1s on likely required skills and escalation criteria, reducing manual guesswork.

- **Data Requirements:**  
  - Full event log with complete ‘required skill,’ ‘category,’ ticket descriptions, assignment, and outcome history.

- **Expected Benefits:**  
  - Greater accuracy in initial assignment, reduced rework, improved FCR at L1, and fewer SLA breaches from misrouted tickets.

## 5. **Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

**A. Simulation (Pre-Implementation Validation):**

- **Business Process Simulation:**
  - Use the mined (actual) process models and reconstructed resource/skill profiles as the baseline ‘as-is’ model.
  - Simulate ticket arrivals and workflow using different assignment logic (current vs. proposed strategies).
  - Model agent availability, skill-based routing, and real-time workload; simulate impact on wait time, ticket flow, SLA achievement, and agent utilization under realistic ticket scenarios (including peak loads and priority shifts).
  
- **Evaluate:**
  - Quantified reduction in escalations, reassignments, agent overload, and SLA breaches in simulated future states vs. current state.
  - Allow “what-if” analysis: impact of varying agent skill distribution, adding/removing agents, sudden influx of high-priority tickets, etc.

**B. Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan:**

- **Process Mining Dashboards:**
  - Track key KPIs and process health indicators:
    - *Assignment Accuracy*: % of tickets correctly assigned to matching skills on first attempt.
    - *Average Number of Handovers/Reassignments*: Tracking improvement over time.
    - *SLA Achievement Rate by Priority*: Immediate detection of trends.
    - *Agent Utilization vs. Idle Time*: Real-time (and trended) views to detect emerging imbalances.
    - *First Call Resolution Rate (FCR) at L1*: Monitored by ticket category and required skill.
    - *Escalation/Resolution Delay*: Time taken from assignment to escalation and from escalation to resolution.
  - *Drilldowns* by:
    - Agent
    - Team/tier
    - Skill category
    - Ticket type
    - Time period

- **Continuous Process Mining:**
  - Weekly/monthly conformance checks to ensure actual assignment flows stay aligned with revised strategies.
  - Early warning for emerging resource bottlenecks, new skill gaps, or declining performance.
  - Monitor for process variant drift that may indicate new issues or process workarounds.
