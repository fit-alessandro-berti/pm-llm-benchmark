### Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive Claim to Approve Claim)**: The average time is around 25 hours with a very low standard deviation. This could indicate a rigid, artificially enforced approval schedule that doesn't align with actual claim processing times.
  
2. **P to N (Approve Claim to Notify Customer)**: There's an unusually long average delay of 7 days between approve and notify, accompanied by a high standard deviation of 2 days. This inconsistency suggests either heavy delays or rapid notifications, possibly due to system backlogs or resource limitations.

3. **A to C (Assign Adjuster to Close Claim)**: The average closure time after assignment is just 2 hours, often without intervening steps like evaluation or approval. This might imply some claims are prematurely closed, potentially skipping critical assessment stages.
  
4. **E to N (Evaluate Claim to Notify Customer)**: The transition from evaluate to notify happens in only 5 minutes on average, which seems too quick and may suggest bypassing necessary intermediary steps or rushed notifications.

### Hypotheses for Anomaly Origins

1. **Systemic Delays** for the R to P anomaly: Manual data entry errors causing delays that consistently add up to around 25 hours.

2. **Automated Workflow Efficiency** for the A to C anomaly: If automated systems quickly assign and close certain straightforward claims without proper evaluation, leading to premature closures.

3. **Resource Availability** for both P to N and A to C anomalies: Irregular availability of resources (like specific adjusters) handling claims could lead to inconsistent timing patterns as claims move through different stages.

4. **Policy Changes or Ad-hoc Adjustments** for the E to N anomaly: New policies or ad-hoc practices might be enforcing quicker notifications, bypassing standard evaluation periods.

### SQL Queries for Anomaly Verification

1. **Identify claims with unusually long Approve to Notify times:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       ce.claim_id,
       ce.adjuster_id,
       ce.customer_id,
       (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) AS time_difference
   FROM 
       claim_events ce
   JOIN 
       claim_events ce2 ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N' AND ce2.timestamp > ce.timestamp
   WHERE 
       ce.activity = 'P' 
   ORDER BY 
       time_difference - INTERVAL '7 days' DESC;  -- Focus on claims where the difference is greater than 7 days
   ```

2. **Correlate anomalies with specific adjusters or regions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       ce1.adjuster_id,
       ce1.region,
       AVG((ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) * 24*60*60) AS avg_time_difference
   FROM 
       claim_events ce1
   JOIN 
       claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N' AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
   WHERE 
       ce1.activity = 'P' 
   GROUP BY 
       ce1.adjuster_id,
       ce1.region
   ORDER BY 
       avg_time_difference - (SELECT AVG((ce3.timestamp - ce4.timestamp) * 24*60*60) FROM claim_events ce3 JOIN claim_events ce4 ON ce3.claim_id = ce4.claim_id AND ce4.activity = 'N' WHERE ce3.activity = 'P') DESC;
   ```

3. **Filter claims closed immediately after assignment, or with excessively long Approve to Notify times:**
   ```sql
   -- Immediate closures after assignment
   SELECT 
       ce1.* 
   FROM 
       claim_events ce1
   JOIN 
       claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C' AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp AND ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp < INTERVAL '1 hour';

   -- Excessively long Approve to Notify times
   SELECT 
       ce.* 
   FROM 
       claim_events ce
   WHERE 
       (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp) * 24*60*60 > INTERVAL '7 days' AND ce.activity = 'P';
   ```

These queries should help pinpoint specific instances of the anomalies and begin to explore potential correlations with other factors like adjuster performance or regional differences.
