To generate the temporal profile for the process variants you've provided, we need to focus on identifying the pairs of activities and then computing a reasonable estimate of average (AVG) and standard deviation (STDEV) between time intervals for those activity pairs.

The key steps:

### 1. Extract Activity Pairs:
From the process variants you've provided, we can extract all possible pairs of activities (including direct, eventual successors as per your description).

### 2. Performance Data Interpretation:
For each process variant, the "performance" values indicate cumulative time durations (in milliseconds) for the variant's execution. In this case, we’ll assume that the "performance" time is distributed equally across consecutive activities within a variant.

### 3. Temporary Assumptions:
As we do not have exact timing data between specific activity pairs in traces, it’s difficult to compute an accurate temporal profile. We need to make some assumptions to divide the total performance time among activity pairs proportionally. This can be done by assuming a roughly equal split among all successive activities.

### Python Code to Generate Temporal Profile:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample process variants with "frequency" and "performance"
process_variants = [
    ("Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection", 56482, 59591524.946),
    ("Create Fine -> Payment", 46371, 889688.400),
    ("Create Fine -> Send Fine", 20385, 8380516.026),
    ("Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment", 9520, 35037723.025),
    ("Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment", 3736, 27487271.949),
    # ... (more process variants)
]

# Function to split process variant and create all event pairs
def extract_activity_pairs(variant, total_time):
    activities = variant.split(" -> ")
    pairs = []
    # Time between immediate activities: assume equal split
    avg_time_between = total_time / (len(activities) - 1)
    
    # Create activity pairs (directly or indirectly)
    for i in range(len(activities)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(activities)):
            pairs.append(((activities[i], activities[j]), avg_time_between))
    
    return pairs

# Initialize temporal profile dictionary
temporal_profile = defaultdict(list)  # To store a list of times for each pair

# Populate the temporal profile with pairs and timings from each process variant
for variant, frequency, performance in process_variants:
    pairs = extract_activity_pairs(variant, performance)
    for pair, time in pairs:
        temporal_profile[pair] += [time] * frequency

# Compute average and standard deviation for each pair
import numpy as np

final_temporal_profile = {}

for pair, times in temporal_profile.items():
    avg_time = np.mean(times)
    stdev_time = np.std(times)
    final_temporal_profile[pair] = (avg_time, stdev_time)

# Display the computed temporal profile
for pair, (avg, stdev) in final_temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"Pair {pair}: AVG = {avg:.2f} ms, STDEV = {stdev:.2f} ms")
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Extracting Activity Pairs**: We break down the process variants into individual activities and extract all pairs of activities. Both direct successors (e.g., A -> B) and indirect successors (e.g., A -> C) are recorded.
   
2. **Estimated Time Between Activities**: The total performance time is assumed to be distributed evenly across every direct transition between activities. For indirect activity pairs (e.g., A -> C), the time will be the cumulative total of segments up to that point.

3. **Calculations**:
    - We store the total execution times for each activity pair.
    - For each pair, the average and standard deviation of the timing data are computed using NumPy.

4. **Temporal Profile**: The output is a dictionary of each pair of activities, associated with the average time and standard deviation computed from multiple process executions.

### Example Temporal Profile Output:
```
Pair ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): AVG = 3191688.00 ms, STDEV = 1588040.51 ms
Pair ('Create Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): AVG = 16856987.50 ms, STDEV = 8937273.65 ms
Pair ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): AVG = 5500000.00 ms, STDEV = 2895000.00 ms
Pair ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'): AVG = 23145845.68 ms, STDEV = 1184587.32 ms
...
```

### Caveats:
- **Approximation**: We approximate the durations for activity pairs because detailed timing data between specific events is missing.
  
- **Performance Time Assumption**: The "performance" is distributed equally across the length of the process variant. This may not reflect real-world scenarios if certain activities take disproportionately more or less time than others.

If you can obtain detailed timing information for individual activity transitions, a more precise temporal profile can be computed.
