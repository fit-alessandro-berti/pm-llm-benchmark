Inferring the case groupings from the given events involves identifying sequences of activities that follow a logical progression characteristic of patient journeys (e.g., registration  triage  consultation  treatment or test  discharge). Since there are no explicit case IDs, we rely on the **temporal proximity**, **department consistency**, and **progression of activities** to infer case groupings. Here's the analysis:

### **Case Groupings**:

#### **Case 1: Patient A (45M)**

- **2024-03-15T08:05:13Z**: Register patient (Admin Clerk, ER; `insurance=private`)
- **2024-03-15T08:10:50Z**: Initial triage (Nurse Joy, ER; `triage_code=3`)
- **2024-03-15T08:22:54Z**: Doctor consultation (Dr. Smith, ER; `diagnosis=minor_infection`)
- **2024-03-15T08:25:19Z**: Surgery performed (Dr. Lee, Surgery; `procedure=arthroscopy`)
- **2024-03-15T08:30:05Z**: Patient discharged (Ward Clerk, ER; `followup=outpatient_clinic`)

#### **Case 2: Patient B (62F)**

- **2024-03-15T08:07:02Z**: Register patient (Admin Clerk, ER; `insurance=public`)
- **2024-03-15T08:12:29Z**: Initial triage (Nurse Mark, ER; `triage_code=2`)
- **2024-03-15T08:15:42Z**: X-ray imaging (Radiology Tech, Radiology; `body_part=left_leg`)
- **2024-03-15T08:16:10Z**: Lab test requested (Dr. Smith, ER; `test_type=blood_panel`)
- **2024-03-15T08:20:27Z**: Lab test completed (Lab Technician, Laboratory; `results=normal_levels`)
- **2024-03-15T08:35:29Z**: Patient discharged (Ward Clerk, ER; `followup=pharmacy_pickup`)

#### **Case 3: Patient C (28M)**

- **2024-03-15T08:07:15Z**: Register patient (Admin Clerk, Surgery; `insurance=private`)
- **2024-03-15T08:13:00Z**: Doctor consultation (Dr. Lee, Surgery; `reason=scheduled_knee_surgery`)
- **2024-03-15T08:16:45Z**: Surgery preparation (Surgical Nurse, Surgery; `prep_type=general_anesthesia`)
- **2024-03-15T08:23:10Z**: Doctor consultation (Dr. Smith, ER; `diagnosis=hairline_fracture`)
- **2024-03-15T08:27:00Z**: Prescription created (Dr. Smith, ER; `medication=antibiotics`)
- **2024-03-15T08:31:37Z**: Recovery room (Recovery Nurse, Surgery; `condition=stable`)
- **2024-03-15T08:40:13Z**: Patient discharged (Ward Clerk, Surgery; `followup=physiotherapy_sessions`)

### **Key Observations**:

1. **Timestamp Proximity**: Events belonging to the same case are closely timed (e.g., ER registration, triage, and consultation for Patient A).
2. **Department Consistency**: Events grouped under the same department remain consistent across a case (e.g., Surgery for Patient C includes preparation, consultation, and discharge).
3. **Activity Nature**: Unique activities like "registration" and "discharged" assist in tracking unique patient journeys.
4. **Diagnosis Alignment**: Diagnoses listed in consultations align with subsequent activities for the same patient (e.g., `diagnosis=minor_infection` aligns with the surgery in Patient A's case).

This segmentation ensures events are logically grouped, providing meaningful cases for further analysis.
