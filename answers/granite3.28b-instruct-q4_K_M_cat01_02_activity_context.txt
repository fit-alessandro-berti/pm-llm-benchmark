```

**Justification:**

1. **Initiate Customer Request** (Original: Initiate Request): This activity is renamed to emphasize the context of a customer's request, regardless of the channel (web portal or walk-in).

2. **Check Document Authenticity** (Original: Verify Documents): Renamed to highlight that the document verification step can involve checking for authenticity and completeness.

3. **Escalate for Missing Docs** (Original: Call Customer): This activity was renamed to underscore its role in escalating due to missing information rather than just being a routine call. The name also suggests a more proactive intervention rather than an initial contact.

4. **Receive Supplementary Docs** (Original: Submit Additional): Renamed to reflect the receipt of additional or supplementary documents from the customer, which is different from the submission that could happen earlier in the process.

5. **Revalidate Documents** (Original: Verify Documents): This name distinguishes a re-verification step after some action (like receiving new documents) has occurred within the case.

6. **Finalize Customer Request** (Original: Approve Request): Renamed to better reflect the final approval stage, including any preceding actions that might have altered or completed the request.

7. **Identity Verification** (Original: Verify Documents): Renamed to specify that this activity is focused on verifying identity-related details rather than a broader document verification.

8. **Initiate Clarification Call** (Original: Call Customer): This name clarifies that the call's purpose is to gather information or clarify issues, distinct from other communication activities.

9. **Internally Adjust Account** (Original: Adjust Account): Renamed to highlight that these adjustments are internal and made after some form of discussion or investigation, which might involve multiple steps in the case.

10. **Schedule Return for Missing Info** (Original: Call Customer): This activity was renamed to emphasize scheduling a return communication due to missing information, distinguishing it from a direct call for clarification.

11. **Make Internal Corrections** (Original: Adjust Account): Renamed to broaden the scope beyond mere account adjustments and include any internal corrections needed due to missing or incorrect data.

12. **Re-Verify Documents After Adjust** (Original: Verify Documents): This activity was renamed to indicate that document verification happens post-adjustment, underscoring its contextual dependence on preceding activities within the case.

13. **Finalize Walk-in Request** (Original: Approve Request): Similar to the changes made for web-based requests, this name emphasizes final approval following all necessary steps for a walk-in scenario.
