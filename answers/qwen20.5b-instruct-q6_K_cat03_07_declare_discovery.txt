Certainly! Here's an example of a `DECLARE` block in MySQL:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fine_insert_notify_fine(IN fine_id INT, IN date_date_of_appeal VARCHAR(10), IN prefecture_name TEXT)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO fine (fine_id, date_date_of_appeal) VALUES ($1, $2);
  
  UPDATE prefectures SET prefecture_name = $3 WHERE prefecture_name = $4;
END $$
LANGUAGE SQL;
```

In this example:
- `fine_id` is the ID of the fine that has been inserted.
- `date_date_of_appeal` is the date of appeal for that fine, as a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
- `prefecture_name` is the name of the prefecture where the fine was originally issued, as a string in the format "Prefecture_Name".
- The function creates a new row in the fine table and updates the prefectures table with the correct information. You would replace "$1", "$2" and "$3" with the actual values for fine_id, date_date_of_appeal and prefecture_name respectively.

Note: This is an example and should be adjusted based on your specific requirements and database schema.
