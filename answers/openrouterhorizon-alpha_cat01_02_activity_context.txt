Below is a concise analysis, a renamed event log, and brief justifications.

1) Recurring activities and contextual meanings
- Verify Documents: Occurs before any customer follow-up and again after new inputs (additional docs or account adjustments). First instance = initial identity/doc check; later instance = re-check post-update.
- Call Customer: Used for different call intents: requesting missing documents, clarifying discrepancies, follow-up confirmation, or recalling a walk-in customer.

2) Renaming strategy
- Verify Documents  Verify Documents (Initial) vs Verify Documents (Post-Update)
- Call Customer  Call Customer (Request Missing Docs), Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy), Call Customer (Follow-up Confirmation), Call Customer (Recall Walk-in)

3) Revised event log with renamed activities

- Call Customer  Call Customer (Recall Walk-in)

4) Justifications
- Initiate Request: Differentiated by channel (Online Submission vs Branch Walk-in) based on Resource and Additional Context.
- Verify Documents: Labeled “Initial” when first identity/doc check occurs; “Post-Update” when done after new information is provided (Submit Additional or Adjust Account). For C003, added “In-Branch” to reflect BranchOfficer/physical verification context.
- Call Customer: Labeled by intent from Additional Context:
  • C001 first call: Request Missing Docs.
  • C002 first call: Clarify Discrepancy; second call: Follow-up Confirmation.
  • C003 call: Recall Walk-in.
- Adjust Account: Clarified as “Internal Correction” and, in C002, “Post-Call” to show dependency on the prior clarification call.
- Approve Request: Labeled “Final” based on Additional Context indicating final approval.
