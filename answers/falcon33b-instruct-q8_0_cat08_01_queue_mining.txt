### **Queue Identification and Characterization**

#### Queue Time Calculation
To calculate waiting times (queue times) between consecutive activities in the event log, we focus on the timestamp differences between the completion of one activity and the start of the next. For instance, to determine the waiting time for the transition from "Nurse Assessment" to "Doctor Consultation (Cardio)" for patient V1001:

- Start of Doctor Consultation: 2024-10-21 09:15:20
- Completion of Nurse Assessment: 2024-10-21 09:25:10

The waiting time between these two activities is calculated as the difference in timestamps. In this case, the waiting time is \(00:09:50\) (9 minutes and 50 seconds).

#### Key Metrics for Queue Characterization
To characterize the queues comprehensively, we calculate several key metrics:

1. **Average Waiting Time:** This provides an overall measure of how long patients typically wait between activities.
2. **Median Waiting Time:** Offers insight into the central tendency of waiting times.
3. **Maximum Waiting Time:** Identifies the longest delay experienced by any patient, which can be critical for understanding worst-case scenarios.
4. **90th Percentile Waiting Time:** Helps to understand what happens to the majority of patients in terms of waiting time; it's useful for setting realistic expectations and identifying potential bottlenecks affecting a significant portion of the population.
5. **Queue Frequency:** The frequency with which certain activities are encountered, indicating how often specific queues occur.
6. **Number of Cases Experiencing Excessive Waits:** Counts instances where patients spend more than a predefined threshold on waiting, highlighting areas of concern.

#### Identifying Critical Queues
Critical queues are those that experience excessive waits or disrupt the flow significantly. We identify these by:

- Analyzing the average, median, and maximum waiting times to find activities with high delays.
- Examining queue frequency for common bottlenecks (e.g., frequent delays between registration and nurse assessment).
- Considering patient types or urgencies where delays have a disproportionate impact on satisfaction or treatment outcomes.

**Criteria Justification:**
- Longest average wait: Identifies the most significant delay impacting overall flow efficiency.
- Highest queue frequency: Signals recurring issues, indicating possible systemic problems.
- Impact on specific patient types: Ensures optimizations address high-priority groups more effectively.

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### Potential Root Causes
1. **Resource Bottlenecks:** Lack of staff or room availability can lead to delays. For instance, multiple doctors consulting simultaneously without additional support could create a queue between nurse assessments and doctor consultations.
2. **Activity Dependencies:** Certain activities might not be initiated when available resources become idle, leading to extended waiting times.
3. **Variability in Activity Durations:** Differences in the time required for different activities can disrupt smooth transitions. For example, ECG tests might take longer than expected, causing subsequent checks.
4. **Appointment Scheduling Policies:** Inefficient or rigid scheduling might lead to overlapping appointments and delays.
5. **Patient Arrival Patterns:** Non-uniform arrival rates can create unexpected queues if not managed effectively.
6. **Type of Patients:** Differences in the complexity or urgency of patient types could affect queue formation.

#### Using Process Mining Techniques
- **Resource Analysis:** By mapping resource utilization over time, we can identify periods with high demand and potential bottlenecks.
- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Visualizing wait times graphically helps pinpoint activities causing the most delay.
- **Variant Analysis:** Examining different patient types or visit flows for variations in wait times can highlight disparities needing targeted solutions.

### **Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### Strategy 1: Revising Resource Allocation
**Target Queue(s):** Doctor Consultation queues, particularly affecting high-urgency patients.
**Root Cause:** Overutilization of staff during peak hours without adequate breaks or planning.
**Data Support:** Analyzing resource usage patterns shows that doctors are busiest between 9 AM and 12 PM. Implementing a staggered schedule or hiring additional part-time staff during these times can reduce waiting times.
**Expected Impact:** A predicted reduction in average wait time for high-urgency patients by 30%.

#### Strategy 2: Modifying Appointment Scheduling Logic
**Target Queue(s):** Delays between nurse assessments and doctor consultations, impacting New patients.
**Root Cause:** Rigid scheduling policies that do not account for variability in appointment durations or resource availability.
**Data Support:** Simulations using historical data show that flexibility in appointment slots can significantly reduce waiting times without increasing cost. Adjusting to allow for a 30-minute buffer between assessments and consultations is feasible and could save time for New patients.
**Expected Impact:** Average wait reduction by 25% for New patients.

#### Strategy 3: Redesigning Patient Flow with Parallelization
**Target Queue(s):** Waiting times between multiple activities, such as ECG test and check-out.
**Root Cause:** Current linear flow pattern that delays subsequent steps after prolonged waits.
**Data Support:** Implementing parallel processing where eligible patients perform multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., while waiting for an ECG) can shorten overall visit duration. This requires minimal additional resources beyond staff training.
**Expected Impact:** Reduction in average wait time by 20% across all patient types, enhancing efficiency without increasing operational costs.

### **Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

#### Trade-offs
1. **Increased Staffing Costs:** Hiring part-time or extending working hours might initially increase operational expenses but could lead to long-term savings by reducing patient dissatisfaction.
2. **Staff Workload:** Implementing staggered schedules requires careful planning to balance workloads, potentially impacting some staff's availability for other duties.
3. **Impact on Care Quality:** Any changes must be implemented carefully to ensure they do not compromise the quality of care. For example, flexibility in scheduling should not lead to rushed or less thorough assessments.

#### Balancing Objectives
- Prioritize patient satisfaction and efficiency over cost initially, recognizing that reducing wait times can lower dissatisfaction rates and improve staff morale.
- Use simulation models to test scenarios before implementation, ensuring proposed changes do not negatively impact other operational aspects.
- Continuously monitor and adjust strategies based on real-time data and feedback from patients and staff.

### **Measuring Success**

#### KPIs for Post-Implementation Monitoring
1. **Average Waiting Time:** Directly measures the effectiveness of optimization efforts.
2. **90th Percentile Waiting Time:** Tracks how well high-demand scenarios are managed.
3. **Patient Satisfaction Scores:** Gauges improvements in patient experience and perceived wait times.
4. **Staff Utilization Rates:** Indicates if additional resources are being effectively leveraged.
5. **Operational Costs:** Monitors financial impact over time to ensure strategies remain cost-effective.

#### Ongoing Process Monitoring
Utilize the same event log data structure to continuously analyze changes in waiting patterns, resource utilization, and patient satisfaction metrics. This real-time feedback loop allows for proactive adjustments, ensuring sustained improvement and alignment with evolving needs.
