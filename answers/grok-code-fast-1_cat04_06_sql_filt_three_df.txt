The task requires writing a DuckDB SQL query based on an event log in a table called `event_log` with columns: `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`.


## Defining Query Requirements  
- The task involves crafting a DuckDB SQL query for the `event_log` table.  
- The table has columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`.  
- The query needs to identify cases with a specific activity sequence.

## Outlining Sequence Logic  
- The query needs to find cases with the exact sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order', with no events in between.  
- Use window functions or self-joins to ensure the activities follow immediately in order.  

## Filtering by Timing Condition  
- Among cases with the sequence, filter those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.  
- This step involves calculating the time difference using the `timestamp` column for the relevant activities.  

## Determining Final Output  
- Exclude cases meeting both the sequence and timing condition (>5 days) from the results.  
- Return all events from cases that either lack the sequence or have it with a time difference of 5 days or less.

## Defining Query Requirements  
- Order events by `case_id` and `timestamp` to ensure chronological sequence analysis.  
- Use LEAD or LAG functions to verify direct succession of activities within each case.  

## Outlining Sequence Logic  
- Identify cases with the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' using row numbers ordered by timestamp.  
- Check for triples where row numbers (rn, rn+1, rn+2) correspond to the activities in sequence, ensuring no events in between.  
- Found that cases must have at least one such triple to meet the sequence criteria.  

## Filtering by Timing Condition  
- For cases with the sequence, calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' for each triple.  
- Exclude cases where any triple shows a time difference greater than 5 days.

## Implementing Query Logic  
- To find cases for exclusion, identify those with the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.  
- Use a CTE with row numbers to order events by timestamp within each case, enabling sequence analysis.  

## Building SQL Structure  
- Join the ranked events to form triples, ensuring activities follow immediately with rn, rn+1, rn+2.

```sql
WITH ranked_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        activity, 
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
triples AS (
    SELECT 
        r1.case_id,
        r2.timestamp AS ts_create,
        r3.timestamp AS ts_confirm
    FROM ranked_events r1
    JOIN ranked_events r2 ON r1.case_id = r2.case_id AND r2.rn = r1.rn + 1
    JOIN ranked_events r3 ON r1.case_id = r3.case_id AND r3.rn = r1.rn + 2
    WHERE r1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND r2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND r3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
bad_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM triples
    WHERE ts_confirm - ts_create > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
``` 

### Explanation:
- **ranked_events CTE**: Assigns a row number (`rn`) to each event within each `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`, to identify the sequence order.
- **triples CTE**: Identifies triples of consecutive events matching the exact sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' (no events in between). Captures timestamps for 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.
- **bad_cases CTE**: From the triples, selects `case_id`s where the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.
- **Main Query**: Returns all events from `event_log` excluding those from `bad_cases` (cases with the sequence and timing condition). Results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity. 

This ensures only events from cases not meeting both the sequence and timing criteria are included. If a case has multiple sequences, it is excluded only if at least one has the timing condition. Cases without the sequence or with the sequence but timing 5 days are included.
