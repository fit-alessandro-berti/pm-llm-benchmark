**Intake & Initial Landlord Contact**

1. When a landlord first contacts the regional office, what information do you typically capture during that very first interaction, before any documents are reviewed?  
2. How do landlords usually reach you (phone, email, web form, referrals), and does the intake process differ depending on the channel?  
3. What criteria do you use to decide whether to accept or decline a property at this earliest stage (e.g., location, property type, minimum standards)?  
4. How do you handle situations where a landlord is shopping around multiple management companies—does that change how you prioritize or process their onboarding?

**Documentation Review & Verification**

5. Can you walk me through the exact set of documents you require from a landlord, and which ones are mandatory versus “nice to have”?  
6. How do you verify the authenticity and validity of documents like deeds, compliance certificates, and inspection reports?  
7. When documents are missing or outdated, how do you manage that follow-up process—who tracks outstanding items, and how long will you keep a case open?  
8. Are there common document issues or compliance gaps that frequently slow down the onboarding, and how are those typically resolved?  
9. Are there any jurisdiction-specific documentation differences between cities or regions that significantly change the process?

**Data Entry & Property Profiling**

10. When you enter property details into the central database, what specific data fields are most critical for downstream steps (e.g., pricing, marketing, compliance)?  
11. How is data quality ensured at this stage—do you have any checks or approvals before the record is considered “complete”?  
12. How often do property details change after the initial entry (e.g., price adjustments, amenity updates), and who is responsible for keeping that information current?

**Assignment of Property Manager**

13. How do you practically assess a property manager’s current workload and capacity when assigning a new property?  
14. What factors carry the most weight in matching a property manager to a property: geography, property type, landlord profile, or something else?  
15. Are there cases where a landlord can request a specific property manager, and how do you handle that?  
16. If a property later turns out to be more complex than expected, do you ever reassign the property to a different manager, and what does that handover look like?

**Manager–Landlord Alignment Meeting**

17. In the introductory call/meeting, what topics are considered essential to cover to avoid misunderstandings later (e.g., SLAs, communication cadence, escalation paths)?  
18. How are special conditions or custom policies documented, and where do they live so that other teams (leasing, compliance, support) can see them?  
19. How do you handle situations where the landlord’s expectations (e.g., desired rent, screening strictness) conflict with your standard policies or market realities?

**Inspections, Photography, and PreMarketing Work**

20. How do you coordinate the scheduling of the photographer and inspector—who initiates, and how are landlord availability and urgency taken into account?  
21. What specific standards does the inspector use to determine if a property “passes,” and are these standards uniform across all regions?  
22. When the inspector identifies issues, how do you determine who is responsible for addressing them (landlord vs. your company vs. third-party contractors)?  
23. Are there time or cost thresholds where you might advise not moving forward with a property due to the remediation required?  
24. How are inspection outcomes and repair status communicated back to marketing, leasing, and the landlord?

**Marketing & Pricing**

25. How does the digital marketing team decide on the positioning and key selling points for a specific property (e.g., target segment, channel mix)?  
26. What inputs feed into the internal pricing models, and how often are these pricing recommendations revisited after launch?  
27. If the landlord disagrees with the suggested rent range, how do you negotiate or reconcile those differences?

**Activation & Tenant Application Handling**

28. What specific conditions must be met for a property to be “activated” in your systems—is there a final checklist or sign-off?  
29. Once active, how are leads and inquiries routed—does the property manager handle them directly, or do leasing agents triage first?  
30. When multiple tenants are interested, what criteria do you use to select among qualified applicants (beyond basic credit and income thresholds)?  
31. How do you manage timing conflicts, such as one applicant needing a quicker move-in date while another offers a longer lease term?

**Tenant Screening & Lease Finalization**

32. What is your standard screening workflow, from application received to decision, and where are the main decision points?  
33. How do you handle borderline cases—applicants who don’t fully meet your criteria but have mitigating factors?  
34. Who has final authority to approve or reject a tenant if there is disagreement between the property manager, landlord, or screening team?  
35. When custom lease clauses are requested by landlords or tenants, how are they reviewed and approved, and by whom?

**Compliance, Audit, and Quality Checks**

36. At what points in the process does the compliance officer get involved, and what exactly do they review?  
37. How does the financial analyst evaluate whether a property aligns with your profitability targets—what metrics or thresholds do they look at?  
38. If a compliance or financial review flags an issue after the property is already active, what is the remediation process?  
39. What kind of regular audits (if any) do you perform on existing properties to ensure ongoing compliance with regulations and internal policies?

**Systems, Communication, and Handoffs**

40. How do you decide what gets tracked in email vs. the CRM vs. project management tools, and who ensures information is consistent across them?  
41. Where do you see the biggest communication breakdowns or handoff issues between regional offices, property managers, marketing, and IT?  
42. How do you manage version control for key artifacts (inspection reports, lease drafts, pricing decisions) across different systems and stakeholders?

**Exceptions, Escalations, and Special Cases**

43. Can you describe a recent complex or exceptional property onboarding (e.g., special insurance, unusual landlord demands) and how you handled it?  
44. What are your typical escalation paths when something goes wrong or stalls—for example, a landlord is unresponsive or a contractor is delayed?  
45. How do you handle properties that span edge cases, such as mixed-use buildings, short-term rentals, or student housing with nonstandard lease cycles?  
46. Under what circumstances might you pause or completely halt the onboarding process, and who can make that decision?

**Performance, KPIs, and Continuous Improvement**

47. What key metrics do you track to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the property onboarding process (e.g., time to live, cost per onboarding, landlord satisfaction)?  
48. How do you collect feedback from landlords, property managers, and internal teams to refine or improve the onboarding steps over time?  
49. Where do you currently see the biggest bottlenecks or pain points in this process, and what ideas do you already have for addressing them?  
50. If you could change one part of the onboarding process tomorrow without constraints, what would you change and why?
