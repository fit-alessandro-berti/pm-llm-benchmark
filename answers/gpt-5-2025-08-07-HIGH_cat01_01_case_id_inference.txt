Inferred cases: 3 distinct patient journeys based on consistent patient_age, patient_gender, department flow, and logical activity order.

Case A (ER, 45-year-old male, insurance=private)
- Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- Timeline:
  - 1 Register patient (ER)
  - 4 Initial triage (ER)
  - 7 X-ray imaging (Radiology) – left_leg
  - 12 Doctor consultation (ER, Dr. Lee) – diagnosis=hairline_fracture
  - 15 Patient discharged (ER) – followup=outpatient_clinic

Case B (ER, 62-year-old female, insurance=public)
- Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- Timeline:
  - 2 Register patient (ER)
  - 5 Initial triage (ER)
  - 8 Lab test requested (ER, Dr. Smith) – blood_panel
  - 10 Lab test completed (Laboratory) – results=normal_levels
  - 11 Doctor consultation (ER, Dr. Smith) – diagnosis=minor_infection
  - 14 Prescription created (ER) – antibiotics
  - 17 Patient discharged (ER) – followup=pharmacy_pickup

Case C (Surgery, 28-year-old male, insurance=private)
- Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
- Timeline:
  - 3 Register patient (Surgery)
  - 6 Doctor consultation (Surgery, Dr. Lee) – scheduled_knee_surgery
  - 9 Surgery preparation (Surgery) – general_anesthesia
  - 13 Surgery performed (Surgery, Dr. Lee) – arthroscopy
  - 16 Recovery room (Surgery) – condition=stable
  - 18 Patient discharged (Surgery) – followup=physiotherapy_sessions

Per-event case assignment
- 1Case A, 2Case B, 3Case C, 4Case A, 5Case B, 6Case C, 7Case A, 8Case B, 9Case C, 10Case B, 11Case B, 12Case A, 13Case C, 14Case B, 15Case A, 16Case C, 17Case B, 18Case C

Rationale
- Each group has a unique patient profile (age/gender/insurance) and follows a coherent process model: ER cases go RegisterTriageDiagnostics/ConsultDischarge; Surgery case goes RegisterConsultPrepSurgeryRecoveryDischarge. Timing across interleaved events remains consistent and non-contradictory.
