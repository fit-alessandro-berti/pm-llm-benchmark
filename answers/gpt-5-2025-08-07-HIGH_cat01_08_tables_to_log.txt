Assumptions and notes:
- Case identification: Each order_id defines a case.
- Activities:
  - One “Item Picked” event per order line with the item, quantity, and picker resource.
  - Two delivery events per delivery record: “Order Dispatched” and “Order Arrived”.
  - One event per invoice and one per payment.
- Resources: Mapped actor_id to names/roles via the Resources table. For payments, no internal resource_id is provided; actor is recorded as “Customer” with role “Payer”.
- Attributes: Static case attributes (customer_id, customer_type, order_priority, sales_person) are repeated on each event row for convenience in process mining.
- Timestamps: All timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC (Z). Events are ordered by Case ID then timestamp; within each case, the sequence follows the real process flow.
- Missing data:
  - Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment records; only creation and picking events appear.
  - Payment amounts are not provided; invoice amounts are shown only on “Invoice Issued” events to avoid implying payment equals invoice.
- If needed, additional derived activities (e.g., “Picking Completed” per order) can be added by aggregating the latest picking time per case.
