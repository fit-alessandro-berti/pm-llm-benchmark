### Anomalies in the DECLARE Model

1. **Contradiction between `responded_existence` and `noncoexistence`:**  
   The rule `responded_existence(E, A)` mandates that every evaluation (`E`) must be preceded by an assignment (`A`). However, the rule `noncoexistence(E, C)` forbids any claim from having both evaluation (`E`) and closure (`C`) events. This is logically inconsistent with the intended process flow, which requires evaluation to occur *before* closure. If closure is forbidden whenever evaluation exists, then no claim can ever be closed after being evaluated — contradicting the business goal of finalizing claims.

2. **Incompatible `existence(C)` with `noncoexistence(E, C)`:**  
   The model enforces that every claim must eventually be closed (`existence(C)`), yet simultaneously forbids any claim from having both evaluation and closure (`noncoexistence(E, C)`). This creates an unsatisfiable condition: to close a claim, an evaluation must occur (per process flow), but the model forbids this combination. Therefore, no valid trace can satisfy both constraints simultaneously.

3. **Missing dependency enforcement for assignment:**  
   While `responded_existence(E, A)` ensures evaluation is preceded by assignment, there is no constraint enforcing that assignment must occur *before* evaluation in a way that prevents bypassing it. Furthermore, there is no rule mandating that assignment must occur *before* closure, even though closure without prior evaluation is logically invalid and contradicts the intended flow.

4. **Overly restrictive `precedence(C, R)` alone is insufficient:**  
   The rule `precedence(C, R)` only ensures closure happens after receipt, but does not enforce intermediate steps (assignment, evaluation, approval, notification). This permits invalid paths such as: R  C, or R  A  C (skipping evaluation), which violate business logic even if not explicitly forbidden.

### Hypotheses for Anomaly Origins

1. **Misaligned business and modeling intent:**  
   The modeler may have intended to prevent fraudulent or premature closures but incorrectly interpreted “no closure without evaluation” as “evaluation and closure cannot coexist,” rather than “closure must be preceded by evaluation.” This reflects a misunderstanding of temporal logic versus coexistence logic.

2. **Incremental policy updates without model revision:**  
   A prior policy may have allowed closure without evaluation (e.g., for low-value claims), and `noncoexistence(E, C)` was added later to enforce full processing. However, the `existence(C)` constraint was retained without revisiting its compatibility, resulting in an irreconcilable conflict.

3. **Data-driven model generation with corrupted traces:**  
   The DECLARE model may have been auto-generated from historical event logs containing anomalies (e.g., claims closed without evaluation due to system errors or manual overrides). The model inadvertently encoded these anomalies as hard constraints, treating noise as policy.

4. **Pressure to reduce claim cycle time leading to logical shortcuts:**  
   To accelerate closure, the model might have been manually edited to block evaluation (perhaps due to high workload or backlog), assuming closure could proceed without it. This operational shortcut was encoded as `noncoexistence(E, C)` without adjusting the mandatory closure requirement.

5. **Incomplete understanding of DECLARE semantics:**  
   The modeler may have confused `noncoexistence` (mutual exclusion) with `response` or `precedence` constraints, leading to misapplication. For example, they may have intended to say “closure must follow evaluation” but incorrectly used `noncoexistence` to mean “evaluation must not occur before closure.”

### SQL-Based Verification Approaches

1. **Find claims closed without any evaluation:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
     AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce2
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id
         AND ce2.activity = 'E'
     );
   ```

2. **Find claims with both evaluation and closure (violating noncoexistence):**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'E'
     AND ce2.activity = 'C';
   ```

3. **Identify claims closed before evaluation (violating intended sequence):**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce_eval ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
   JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
   WHERE ce_close.timestamp < ce_eval.timestamp;
   ```

4. **Detect claims assigned but never evaluated (violating responded_existence):**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce_assign ON c.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce_eval
       WHERE ce_eval.claim_id = c.claim_id
         AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
         AND ce_eval.timestamp > ce_assign.timestamp
   );
   ```

5. **Verify if all closures are preceded by approval and notification (to detect skipped steps):**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce_approve
       WHERE ce_approve.claim_id = c.claim_id
         AND ce_approve.activity = 'P'
         AND ce_approve.timestamp < ce_close.timestamp
   )
   OR NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce_notify
       WHERE ce_notify.claim_id = c.claim_id
         AND ce_notify.activity = 'N'
         AND ce_notify.timestamp < ce_close.timestamp
   );
   ```

6. **Check for closure without prior receipt (violating precedence):**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce_close ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce_receive
       WHERE ce_receive.claim_id = c.claim_id
         AND ce_receive.activity = 'R'
         AND ce_receive.timestamp < ce_close.timestamp
   );
   ```

7. **Identify claims where evaluation was performed by a non-matching adjuster (e.g., auto adjuster evaluating home claim):**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce.resource, a.specialization
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
   JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
   WHERE (c.claim_type = 'home_insurance' AND a.specialization != 'home')
      OR (c.claim_type = 'auto_insurance' AND a.specialization != 'auto');
   ```

These queries enable empirical validation of whether the declared model’s constraints are violated in actual process execution, revealing systemic deviations from intended policy.
