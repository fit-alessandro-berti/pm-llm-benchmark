To describe the process underlying the provided DECLARE declarative process model, I will break down the constraints and their implications in a step-by-step manner:
1. Initialization:
The trace starts with the activity "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE." This means that the process always begins with an employee submitting a declaration.
2. Existence:
All the specified activities must occur at least once in the process:
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
* Request Payment
* Payment Handled
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
3. Exactly 1:
Each of the mentioned activities occurs exactly once in the process:
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
* Request Payment
* Payment Handled
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
4. Precedence:
The following activities must occur before the specified related activities:
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE before Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE before Payment Handled
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE before Request Payment
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR before Request Payment
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR before Payment Handled
5. Absence:
The following activities are not part of the process:
* Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER
* Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION
* Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION
* Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE
* Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE
* Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR
* Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER
* Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR
* Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER
* Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER
* Declaration REJECTED by MISSING
6. Response:
The occurrence of these activities implies the occurrence of the related activities at some point in the future:
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR implies Payment Handled
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE implies Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE implies Request Payment
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE implies Payment Handled
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR implies Request Payment
* Request Payment implies Payment Handled
7. Co-Existence:
The following pairs of activities must co-occur in the process:
* Request Payment and Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
* Request Payment and Payment Handled
* Request Payment and Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR and Request Payment
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR and Payment Handled
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR and Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
* Payment Handled and Request Payment
* Payment Handled and Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
* Payment Handled and Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE and Request Payment
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE and Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE and Payment Handled
8. Succession:
The following pairs of activities must occur consecutively in the process:
* Request Payment and Payment Handled
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR and Request Payment
* Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR and Payment Handled
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE and Request Payment
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE and Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE and Payment Handled
Based on these constraints, the underlying process can be described as follows:

1. An employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The declaration is approved by a supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
3. A payment request is made (Request Payment).
4. The payment is handled (Payment Handled).

These activities must occur in the specified order, with no repetitions or additional activities not mentioned in the constraints.
