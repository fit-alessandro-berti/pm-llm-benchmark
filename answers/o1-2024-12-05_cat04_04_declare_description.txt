The data describes a highly constrained, linear business process that involves four primary activities, each executed exactly once, in a strict sequence. The process starts with an "Initialization" constraint, ensuring that the first activity is always **"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"**. After this initial submission, the process proceeds through a carefully defined path of approval and payment activities, each bound by multiple overlapping constraints to guarantee their order, existence, and mutual relationships.

**Key Activities (All occur exactly once):**  
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**  
2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**  
3. **Request Payment**  
4. **Payment Handled**

**Overall Flow:**  
- The process **always starts** when an employee submits a declaration.  
- After the declaration is submitted, the supervisor’s final approval must occur before proceeding.  
- Once the declaration is finally approved, a payment request must follow.  
- Subsequently, the payment must be handled (i.e., processed) after the payment request.  
- No other activities are allowed to occur (as indicated by the multiple Absence constraints on other possible declaration states).

**Underlying Logic and Constraints:**

1. **Existence/Absence Constraints:**  
   - The four main activities (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment, Payment Handled) must each occur **exactly once**, ensuring a single, unbranched “happy path” from submission to payment handling.  
   - A large set of activities (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by X", "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by Y") are explicitly absent. This means the process excludes any alternative approval routes, rejections, or intermediate steps. It’s a tightly controlled flow where no deviations are possible.

2. **Responded Existence & Co-Existence Constraints:**  
   Each activity’s occurrence necessitates the occurrence of all the others. For instance, if the declaration is submitted, the final approval, request payment, and payment handled steps must also occur. Similarly, if final approval happens, then both request payment and payment handled must also be in the trace. These constraints ensure that the process is a complete set of these four events; none can stand alone.

3. **Response, Precedence, and Succession (and their “Chain” and “Alternate” variants):**  
   The process is locked into a specific order:
   - **Precedence:** If later activities occur (e.g., Payment Handled), the earlier ones (e.g., Request Payment, Final Approval, Submission) must have occurred before.  
   - **Response:** If an earlier activity occurs (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE), it requires a later activity (e.g., Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR) to occur in the future of the trace.  
   - **Succession:** The combination of response and precedence ensures a strict forward and backward linkage: each activity is directly tied to the next in line.  
   - **Chain Precedence and Chain Response:** These constraints are even stricter, requiring that the next activity follows immediately (directly-follows relation) from the previous.  
   - **Alternate Response/Precedence/Succession:** These prevent repeats of the same activity in between pairs, ensuring that once “Declaration SUBMITTED” occurs, the very next related event in the dependency chain is the corresponding target activity (e.g., “Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR” without anything else interleaved).

In essence, the entire constraint set forces a simple, one-time, linear sequence of four steps:

**"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" → "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" → "Request Payment" → "Payment Handled"**

No deviations, no parallel paths, no repetitions. All other potential states or activities (rejections, saves, different approval paths) are disallowed. The process described by these constraints is thus a highly controlled workflow: a declaration is submitted, approved, payment is requested, and then the payment is processed—exactly in that order and each step exactly once.
