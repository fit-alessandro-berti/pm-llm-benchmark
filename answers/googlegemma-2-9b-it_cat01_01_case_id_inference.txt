Here's a breakdown of the events grouped into likely cases:

**Case 1:**

*  Event 4: Initial triage, patient age 45, male, ER department.
*  Event 13: Doctor consultation, patient age 45, male, ER department, diagnosis: hairline_fracture.
*  Event 15: Patient discharged, patient age 45, male, ER department.

**Case 2:**

*  Event 2: Register patient, patient age 62, female, ER department.
*  Event 5: Initial triage, patient age 62, female, ER department.
*  Event 8: Lab test requested, patient age 62, female, ER department.
*  Event 10: Lab test completed, patient age 62, female, Laboratory.
*  Event 12: Doctor consultation, patient age 62, female, ER department, diagnosis: minor_infection.
*  Event 17: Patient discharged, patient age 62, female, ER department.

**Case 3:**

*  Event 3: Register patient, patient age 28, male, Surgery department.
*  Event 6: Doctor consultation, patient age 28, male, Surgery department, reason: scheduled_knee_surgery.
*  Event 9: Surgery preparation, patient age 28, male, Surgery department.
*  Event 13: Surgery performed, patient age 28, male, Surgery department.
*  Event 16: Recovery room, patient age 28, male, Surgery department.
*  Event 18: Patient discharged, patient age 28, male, Surgery department. 





**Reasoning:**

* **Department:** Events within the same case typically occur within the same department or flow through departments logically. For example, Case 3 involves Surgery, while Case 1 and 2 involve ER.
* **Patient Attributes:** Matching patient ages and genders across events strengthens the case grouping.
* **Activity Sequence:** The sequence of activities, such as registration, triage, consultations, tests, procedures, and discharge, often follows a logical pattern within a case.
