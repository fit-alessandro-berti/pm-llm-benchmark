The provided data outlines various workflows or processes related to declarations, approvals, rejections, and payment handling in a business setting, possibly within an expense management system. Each line represents a sequence of states and transitions for a particular declaration (likely for expenses), starting from its submission by the employee until either its final approval or rejection.

Let's break down each key step and identify the stakeholders involved:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** The process starts when an employee submits a declaration, such as an expense report.
   
2. **Declaration APPROVED/REJECTED by [PRE_APPROVER]/[ADMINISTRATION]:** Depending on the organization’s structure or type of approval required, a pre-approver (who may be another member in the same team or department) or administration (higher-level management or a specific office handling such tasks) reviews and decides whether to approve or reject the declaration. If rejected, it goes back to the employee for possible re-submission.

3. **Declaration APPROVED/REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER:** In cases where budget approval is necessary, the next step involves checking against allocated budgets. The budget owner checks if the expenses are within limits and approves or rejects accordingly. Again, rejection may lead to another round of submission from the employee.
   
4. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED/REJECTED by SUPERVISOR:** Supervisors play a critical role in final approval decisions, especially for ensuring alignment with business goals and policies. A supervisor’s decision can finalize the process or send it back to the employee if rejected.

5. **Request Payment -> Payment Handled:** Once all approvals are received, payment is requested and processed through the system, concluding the cycle positively.
   
6. **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING/EMPLOYEE:** These indicate steps where an action was expected but not completed correctly or at all. This could be due to oversight or issues in the workflow.

The data includes a performance metric for each sequence of events, likely reflecting total time taken (in some units) from submission to conclusion, indicating efficiency and potential bottlenecks within different sequences:

- **Frequency:** How often this specific flow occurred.
- **Performance:** A measure of how well the process performed, possibly based on turnaround times or costs associated.

This data could be used for process optimization by identifying common rejections, frequent rerouting steps (indicating potential inefficiencies), and areas where delays occur most.
