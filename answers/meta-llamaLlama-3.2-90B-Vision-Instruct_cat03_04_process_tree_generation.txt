Here is a possible Python code to implement a process tree for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define the root node of the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Define the sequence of activities for purchasing
purchasing_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
purchasing_start = ProcessTree(label="Purchase Request", parent=purchasing_seq)
purchasing_approval = ProcessTree(label="Purchase Approval", parent=purchasing_seq)
purchasing_order = ProcessTree(label="Purchase Order", parent=purchasing_seq)
purchasing_seq.children.extend([purchasing_start, purchasing_approval, purchasing_order])

# Define the sequence of activities for payment
payment_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
invoice_receipt = ProcessTree(label="Invoice Receipt", parent=payment_seq)
invoice_verification = ProcessTree(label="Invoice Verification", parent=payment_seq)
payment_execution = ProcessTree(label="Payment Execution", parent=payment_seq)
payment_seq.children.extend([invoice_receipt, invoice_verification, payment_execution])

# Add a loop for payment cycle
payment_cycle = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)
payment_cycle.children.append(payment_seq)

# Add the purchasing and payment cycle to the root node
root.children.extend([purchasing_seq, payment_cycle])

# Note: we could also add other parallel branches, such as " Goods Receipt" or "Accounts Payable"

print(root)
```
This code defines a process tree for a Purchase-to-Pay process, which includes the following activities:

1. Purchasing:
	* Purchase Request
	* Purchase Approval
	* Purchase Order
2. Payment:
	* Invoice Receipt
	* Invoice Verification
	* Payment Execution
3. Payment Cycle:
	+ Loop of payment activities (Invoice Receipt -> Invoice Verification -> Payment Execution)

The process tree is defined using the operators `SEQUENCE`, `PARALLEL`, and `LOOP`. The `SEQUENCE` operator defines a sequence of activities, while the `PARALLEL` operator defines activities that can be executed in true concurrency. The `LOOP` operator defines a loop that can be executed multiple times.

Note that this is just one possible implementation of a Purchase-to-Pay process tree, and you can modify it to fit your specific requirements.
