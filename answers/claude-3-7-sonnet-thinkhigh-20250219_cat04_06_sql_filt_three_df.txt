# DuckDB SQL Query for Filtering Event Logs Based on Activity Sequence and Time Criteria

To solve this problem, I need to identify and exclude cases where a specific sequence of activities occurs in direct succession with a particular time constraint between two of those activities.

```sql
WITH activities_ordered AS (
    -- Step 1: Assign row numbers to events based on timestamp within each case
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as row_num
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_instances AS (
    -- Step 2: Identify instances of the specific sequence in direct succession
    SELECT 
        a1.case_id,
        a2.timestamp as create_timestamp,
        a3.timestamp as confirm_timestamp
    FROM activities_ordered a1
    JOIN activities_ordered a2 ON a1.case_id = a2.case_id AND a1.row_num + 1 = a2.row_num
    JOIN activities_ordered a3 ON a2.case_id = a3.case_id AND a2.row_num + 1 = a3.row_num
    WHERE a1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND a2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND a3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
cases_with_condition AS (
    -- Step 3: Filter for instances where the time elapsed between "Create Order" and "Confirm Order" exceeds 5 days
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence_instances
    WHERE date_diff('day', create_timestamp, confirm_timestamp) > 5
)
-- Step 4: Exclude events from cases that meet both the sequence and time criteria
SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_with_condition)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
```

## Explanation:

1. **First CTE (`activities_ordered`)**: Assigns sequential row numbers to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp. This will help identify activities that occur in direct succession.

2. **Second CTE (`sequence_instances`)**: Identifies instances where the three specified activities occur in direct succession by joining on consecutive row numbers. This ensures no other activities occur between them.

3. **Third CTE (`cases_with_condition`)**: Filters the sequence instances to only include cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.

4. **Final query**: Returns all events from the original event log, except those belonging to cases that meet both the sequence pattern and the timing condition, ordered by case_id and timestamp for readability.

This query effectively implements the three requirements of the problem: identifying the specific sequence, applying the time condition, and excluding the matching cases from the result.
