### 1. Identifying Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

The temporal profile model reveals several anomalies based on unexpected average times and standard deviations between activities:

- **R (Receive) to P (Approve):**
  - **Average Time:** ~25 hours (90000 seconds)
  - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (3600 seconds)
  - **Anomaly:** The low standard deviation suggests an unusually consistent approval process, which may not account for variability in claim complexity.

- **P (Approve) to N (Notify):**
  - **Average Time:** 7 days (604800 seconds)
  - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days (172800 seconds)
  - **Anomaly:** The long delay and high variability indicate potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the notification process.

- **A (Assign) to C (Close):**
  - **Average Time:** 2 hours (7200 seconds)
  - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (3600 seconds)
  - **Anomaly:** Claims are being closed too quickly after assignment, possibly bypassing necessary evaluation steps.

- **E (Evaluate) to N (Notify):**
  - **Average Time:** 5 minutes (300 seconds)
  - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute (60 seconds)
  - **Anomaly:** The rapid transition from evaluation to notification may suggest automated triggers or skipped steps.

### 2. Hypotheses on Anomalies

- **R to P:**
  - **Hypothesis:** An automated system may be approving claims rapidly, especially for straightforward cases, leading to low variability.

- **P to N:**
  - **Hypothesis:** Notification delays could be due to a backlog in the notification process or requirements for additional customer information post-approval.

- **A to C:**
  - **Hypothesis:** Claims might be closed prematurely by adjusters, potentially due to automated systems or adjuster error, skipping evaluations.

- **E to N:**
  - **Hypothesis:** An automated system might be triggering notifications immediately after evaluation, reducing the time between these steps.

### 3. Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

#### a. Identifying Claims with Unusual Time Gaps

- **For R to P:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      c.claim_id, 
      c.claim_type, 
      a.name AS adjuster_name,
      EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS time_diff
  FROM 
      claim_events r
  JOIN 
      claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      r.activity = 'R'
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) < 7200  -- Claims approved in less than 2 hours
  ORDER BY 
      time_diff ASC;
  ```

- **For P to N:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      c.claim_id, 
      c.claim_type, 
      a.name AS adjuster_name,
      EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS time_diff
  FROM 
      claim_events p
  JOIN 
      claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      p.activity = 'P'
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 1209600  -- Claims notified after 14 days
  ORDER BY 
      time_diff DESC;
  ```

- **For A to C:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      c.claim_id, 
      c.claim_type, 
      a.name AS adjuster_name,
      EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a_e.timestamp)) AS time_diff
  FROM 
      claim_events a_e
  JOIN 
      claim_events c ON a_e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c.activity = 'C'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON a_e.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      a_e.activity = 'A'
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a_e.timestamp)) < 7200  -- Claims closed within 2 hours of assignment
  ORDER BY 
      time_diff ASC;
  ```

- **For E to N:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      c.claim_id, 
      c.claim_type, 
      a.name AS adjuster_name,
      EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS time_diff
  FROM 
      claim_events e
  JOIN 
      claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      e.activity = 'E'
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 600  -- Claims notified within 10 minutes of evaluation
  ORDER BY 
      time_diff ASC;
  ```

#### b. Correlating Anomalies with Adjusters, Claim Types, or Regions

- **For R to P:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      a.name AS adjuster_name, 
      c.claim_type, 
      AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp))) AS avg_time_diff
  FROM 
      claim_events r
  JOIN 
      claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      r.activity = 'R'
  GROUP BY 
      a.name, c.claim_type
  HAVING 
      AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp))) < 7200  -- Average approval time less than 2 hours
  ORDER BY 
      avg_time_diff ASC;
  ```

- **For P to N:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      a.name AS adjuster_name, 
      c.claim_type, 
      AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))) AS avg_time_diff
  FROM 
      claim_events p
  JOIN 
      claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      p.activity = 'P'
  GROUP BY 
      a.name, c.claim_type
  HAVING 
      AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))) > 1209600  -- Average notification time greater than 14 days
  ORDER BY 
      avg_time_diff DESC;
  ```

- **For A to C:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      a.name AS adjuster_name, 
      c.claim_type, 
      AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a_e.timestamp))) AS avg_time_diff
  FROM 
      claim_events a_e
  JOIN 
      claim_events c ON a_e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c.activity = 'C'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON a_e.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      a_e.activity = 'A'
  GROUP BY 
      a.name, c.claim_type
  HAVING 
      AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a_e.timestamp))) < 7200  -- Average closure time less than 2 hours
  ORDER BY 
      avg_time_diff ASC;
  ```

- **For E to N:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      a.name AS adjuster_name, 
      c.claim_type, 
      AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))) AS avg_time_diff
  FROM 
      claim_events e
  JOIN 
      claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      e.activity = 'E'
  GROUP BY 
      a.name, c.claim_type
  HAVING 
      AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))) < 600  -- Average notification time less than 10 minutes
  ORDER BY 
      avg_time_diff ASC;
  ```

#### c. Filtering by Specific Conditions

- **Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      c.claim_id, 
      c.claim_type, 
      a.name AS adjuster_name
  FROM 
      claim_events a_e
  JOIN 
      claim_events c ON a_e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c.activity = 'C'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON a_e.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      a_e.activity = 'A'
      AND c.timestamp - a_e.timestamp < INTERVAL '2 hours'
  ORDER BY 
      c.timestamp ASC;
  ```

- **Claims with Approve to Notify Taking Over 7 Days:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      c.claim_id, 
      c.claim_type, 
      a.name AS adjuster_name
  FROM 
      claim_events p
  JOIN 
      claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      p.activity = 'P'
      AND n.timestamp - p.timestamp > INTERVAL '7 days'
  ORDER BY 
      n.timestamp DESC;
  ```

- **Claims with Evaluate to Notify Under 5 Minutes:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      c.claim_id, 
      c.claim_type, 
      a.name AS adjuster_name
  FROM 
      claim_events e
  JOIN 
      claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
  JOIN 
      claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      e.activity = 'E'
      AND n.timestamp - e.timestamp < INTERVAL '5 minutes'
  ORDER BY 
      n.timestamp ASC;
  ```

### Conclusion

By analyzing the temporal profile model and executing these SQL queries, we can identify specific claims, adjusters, and claim types that exhibit unusual timing patterns. This analysis can help uncover systemic issues, bottlenecks, or inefficiencies in the claim handling process, leading to improved process management and customer satisfaction.
