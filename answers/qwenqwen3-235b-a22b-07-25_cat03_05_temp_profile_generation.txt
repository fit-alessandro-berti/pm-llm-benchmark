### Notes:
- Times are in **seconds**.
- The temporal estimates reflect realistic delays in a **global high-tech supply chain**, including variability due to logistics, inspection, manufacturing, and customer behavior.
- Pairs like `('SS', 'AS')` have very long average times and high standard deviations, reflecting the extended lifecycle from procurement to post-sale support.
- Closer activities (e.g., `('PT', 'PK')`) have shorter and more predictable delays.
- The profile includes **non-consecutive** pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'PT')`) to capture long-range temporal dependencies.
- `ZETA` can later be used to flag deviations (e.g., if `ZETA = 2`, any time outside `AVG ± 2*STDEV` is anomalous).
