### POWL nodes (activities)
- `OR`, `MS`, `QS`, `AS`, `IQC`, `TST`, `RT`, `PK`, `LB`, `DP`, `D` as **Transition(label=...)**
- `_iqc`, `_lb` as **SilentTransition()** (two distinct silent skips)

---

### Control-flow operators (loops / choices)

**1) “IQC repeated if needed” (one-or-more IQC executions)**
- `IQC_plus = * ( IQC, _iqc )`  
  Semantics: `IQC ( _iqc IQC )*`  visible behavior is `IQC, IQC IQC, IQC IQC IQC, ...`

**2) Assembly rework loop driven by IQC**
- `AS_rework = * ( AS, IQC_plus )`  
  Semantics: `AS ( IQC_plus AS )*`  
  Captures:
  - no IQC at all (exit after first `AS`, as in Case 4)
  - rework cycles like `AS IQC AS`, `AS IQC IQC AS`, `AS IQC AS IQC AS`, etc. (Cases 1,2,3,5)

**3) Testing with re-testing**
- `TST_loop = * ( TST, RT )`  
  Semantics: `TST ( RT TST )*` (Cases 1,3,5; and allows no `RT` as in Cases 2,4)

**4) Optional labeling**
- `LB_opt = X ( LB, _lb )`  
  (labeling performed or skipped; Case 2 skips)

---

### Root partial order (overall process)
A sequential (total) order consistent with all cases:

**POWL**
```
PO = (
  nodes = { OR, MS, QS, AS_rework, TST_loop, PK, LB_opt, DP, D },
  order = {
    OR-->MS,
    MS-->QS,
    QS-->AS_rework,
    AS_rework-->TST_loop,
    TST_loop-->PK,
    PK-->LB_opt,
    LB_opt-->DP,
    DP-->D
  }
)
```

This is the final POWL structure: a strict partial order chaining the major stages, with (i) an assembly/IQC-driven rework loop (including repeated IQC), (ii) a testing/re-testing loop, and (iii) an optional labeling choice.
