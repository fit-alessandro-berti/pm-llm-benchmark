Based on the data provided, the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups are:

1. Frequency of Process Variants: The frequency of process variants in the 'unprotected' group is generally higher than in the 'protected' group. This suggests that a larger number of individuals in the 'unprotected' group are going through these processes.

2. Treatment Paths: The 'protected' group has more diverse treatment paths, including more instances of registration without subsequent treatment and more instances of treatment being unsuccessful before eventually being successful. On the other hand, the 'unprotected' group has fewer diverse treatment paths, with most processes leading directly to successful treatment.

3. Performance Time: The performance time for each process variant is largely similar between the two groups. However, the 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of more time-consuming processes (e.g., processes involving multiple unsuccessful treatments before a successful one).

4. Registration: There are instances in the 'protected' group where individuals register but do not proceed to treatment. This is not the case in the 'unprotected' group, suggesting that individuals in the 'protected' group may face more barriers to accessing treatment after registration.

These differences could be indicative of disparities in healthcare access and treatment outcomes between the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups. However, further analysis would be needed to confirm these findings and identify potential causes.
