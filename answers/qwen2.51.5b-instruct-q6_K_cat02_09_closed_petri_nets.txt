Certainly! Here are the proposed concepts for the other direction:

1. **Sink Place:**
   - A sink place is a special type of Petri net symbol that has no input markings, but it can have output markings. It typically represents endpoints or outputs in a system.
   
2. **Global Transition:
   - A global transition in a Petri net involves the usage of multiple pre-marks from one source and multiple post-marks to another destination, allowing for global changes rather than just marking individual places.

3. **Unbound Net:**
   - An unbound Petri net does not have any constraints or boundedness rules. Every component can connect directly to each other without limitations imposed by the number of pre- marks that a place may hold.

4. **Decoating Petri Net:
   - The de-coupling process, often referred to as "decoupling" in the context of concurrent systems design, involves breaking down concurrent tasks or components based on their functional interactions and synchronization behaviors into independent parts, so they can be analyzed individually without mutual interference.

5. **Sequential Net:**
   - This concept refers to a Petri net where processes are executed sequentially rather than concurrently. Each place represents a step in the sequential execution of events represented by transitions.

Each of these concepts offers new perspectives on various aspects of Petri nets and their practical applications, whether they concern specific elements within the net or broader systems design principles.
