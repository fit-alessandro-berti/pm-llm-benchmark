1. How do you balance cost efficiency and resilience when deciding between single- and multi-sourcing for critical components, and what events would trigger a re-sourcing decision?
2. What mechanisms provide visibility into tier-2 and tier-3 suppliers’ capacity, lead times, and compliance, and how are geopolitical and climate risks modeled and mitigated?
3. How are quality standards and test protocols harmonized across suppliers, and what rapid containment procedures prevent defective lots from reaching final assembly?
4. Where is the decoupling point set in the network, and how are safety stocks and postponement strategies optimized to buffer variability without tying up excessive working capital?
5. What is the S&OP/IBP governance model, and how do you measure forecast value add, bias, and ML model governance (drift, explainability) to confirm analytics improve decisions?
6. How are cost, speed, service levels, and carbon emissions jointly optimized when choosing air versus ocean (or rail) freight, and do you operate against a carbon budget or science-based targets?
7. What traceability capabilities (serialization, IoT, blockchain) exist from component origin to finished goods, and how do they accelerate recalls, warranty adjudication, and regulatory audits?
8. How is cyber risk managed across plants, suppliers, and logistics partners, and what is the incident response plan if ransomware disrupts production scheduling or EDI flows?
9. How are multi-currency exposures managed across purchase orders, hedges, and transfer pricing, and how do FX movements influence sourcing, pricing, and inventory placement over the product lifecycle?
10. What capacity planning, line balancing, and OEE strategies are used at the Malaysian plant, and how do predictive maintenance and labor planning mitigate unplanned downtime or demand spikes?
11. How do you ensure ethical sourcing and regulatory compliance (e.g., conflict minerals, cobalt, RoHS/REACH) across jurisdictions, and how are supplier audits, findings, and remediation prioritized?
12. How does design-for-manufacture/repair/modularity influence BOM choices and assembly flow, and what impact does it have on scrap, warranty cost, and refurbishment economies?
13. How are customs, export controls, and sanctions compliance handled (e.g., Incoterms, importer of record), and are FTZs, bonded warehouses, or duty drawback used to reduce landed cost?
14. What control-tower visibility and early-warning signals are in place to detect exceptions (port congestion, yield drops, forecast spikes), and how are cross-functional playbooks executed?
15. How are inventory and replenishment strategies differentiated by market velocity and channel (retail, e-commerce, DTC), and what triggers shift inventory or reallocate supply to avoid obsolescence and EOL write-offs?
16. What is the approach to packaging optimization and dangerous goods compliance for lithium-ion batteries (UN 38.3, IATA/IMDG), balancing protection, cost, and sustainability?
17. How are field returns, warranty claims, and failure analytics fed back into supplier quality and next-gen design, and what is the end-to-end latency of that closed loop?
18. Which supply chain finance programs (dynamic discounting, reverse factoring) support supplier liquidity while improving your working capital, and how are ESG performance metrics incorporated?
19. How do data governance and master data management ensure consistent product, supplier, and trade data across ERP, TMS, WMS, and PLM, while meeting data localization and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) for DTC operations?
20. What scenario planning or digital twin simulations are used to test disruptions (factory shutdowns, export bans, port closures), and which mitigation investments (dual sourcing, buffer inventory, alternate lanes) deliver the best ROI?
