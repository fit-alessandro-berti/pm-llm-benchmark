Certainly! Below is a representative subset of the **Temporal Profile** for the described global supply chain process. The dictionary includes both directly connected and eventually-following activity pairs, with estimated average times and standard deviations given in seconds. These estimates consider natural delays expected in a complex, real-world global manufacturing and logistics process, such as lead times, inspection durations, assembly complexity, and distribution lag.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 7200),         # Supplier selection to order placement (~1 day)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (345600, 43200),       # Supplier selection to receiving components (~4 days)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1209600, 172800),     # Supplier selection to distribution (~14 days)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (259200, 21600),       # Order placement to receive components (~3 days)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (345600, 28800),       # Order placement to quality inspection (~4 days)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (432000, 43200),       # Order placement to component assembly (~5 days)
    
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 14400),        # Receiving to inspection (~1 day)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (172800, 21600),       # Receiving to component assembly (~2 days)
    
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 7200),         # Quality inspection to assembly (~0.5 day)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (259200, 43200),       # Quality inspection to packaging (~3 days)
    
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 10800),        # Assembly to product testing (~1 day)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (172800, 21600),       # Assembly to warehouse storage (~2 days)
    
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 7200),         # Product testing to packaging (~0.5 day)
    ('PT', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),       # Product testing to distribution (~2 days)

    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 10800),        # Packaging to warehouse storage (~1 day)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (172800, 21600),       # Packaging to distribution (~2 days)

    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 86400),        # Warehouse storage to distribution (~1 day avg, high std dev)
    
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800),      # Distribution to after-sales support (~7 days)
    ('CA', 'AS'): (967680, 172800),      # Assembly to after-sales support (~11 days)
    ('SS', 'AS'): (1987200, 345600)      # Supplier selection to after-sales support (~23 days)
}
```

### Notes:

- **Time Units**: All time values are in seconds.
- **Standard Deviations** are set relative to the complexity and variability of the activity transition. For example, distribution and after-sales support have higher deviations due to geography and customer behavior variability.
- **Long-range Transitions** (e.g., `'SS'` to `'DT'`) are included to reflect complex interactions across subprocesses.
- **Warehouse/Storage Transitions** have higher variability due to dynamic storage durations awaiting shipment logistics.

This temporal profile allows deviation detection during process conformance checking, helping identify bottlenecks or anomalies in executions.
