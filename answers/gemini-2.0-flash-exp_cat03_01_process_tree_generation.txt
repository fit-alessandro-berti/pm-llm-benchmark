**Explanation:**

1. **Root Sequence:** The process begins with a sequence of arrival, registration, and initial assessment (`-> (A, RG, IA)`), which is reflected by the top-level `ProcessTree` with `Operator.SEQUENCE`.
2. **Triage:** The triage process is represented as a sequence (`-> (TI, TC)`), added to the root sequence.
3. **Initial Diagnostics (XOR):** An exclusive choice between a comprehensive ECG and a full blood panel is handled by a `ProcessTree` with `Operator.XOR`.
4. **Loop for Abnormal Results:** The loop structure is implemented with `Operator.LOOP`. Inside the loop:
   - **Specialist Consultation:** The specialist consultation is a step in the loop
   - **Treatment Choice (XOR):** The exclusive choice between targeted medication or specialized physical therapy is handled by an `XOR` process tree.
   - **Re-Diagnostic Test (XOR):** Another exclusive choice for re-testing is implemented.
   - **Tau Step:** A tau step is added at the end of the loop to allow exiting it.
5. **Parallel Activities:** Advanced imaging and nutritional counseling are done in parallel, represented by a `ProcessTree` with `Operator.PARALLEL`.
6. **Follow-up Sequence:** The follow-up appointment scheduling and detailed discharge instructions are sequenced ( `->(FAS, DDI)`).
7. **Final Concurrency:** The billing, insurance claims processing, and medical records finalization all occur in parallel with `Operator.PARALLEL`.

**Correct Parent-Child Relationships:** The code ensures that the `parent` property of each `ProcessTree` object is correctly set to its parent node in the process tree structure, as specified in the prompt.
**Verification:** The `print_process_tree()` function was added to verify the correctness of the structure.

This complete process tree captures the intricate flow and decision points described in the complex hospital scenario using the provided process tree operators.
