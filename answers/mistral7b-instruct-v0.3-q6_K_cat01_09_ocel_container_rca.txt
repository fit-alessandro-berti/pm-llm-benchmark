 From the provided data, several potential root causes for performance issues can be identified:

1. Imbalance in Process Flow: The duration of some events significantly exceeds others. For example, "Reschedule Container" has a high duration compared to its frequency of occurrence. This could indicate inefficiencies or bottlenecks within the process flow.

2. Overutilization of Resources: In the Forklift section, the event "Place in Stock" -> "Load to Vehicle" has a high frequency and long duration, which may suggest that resources (forklifts in this case) are being overutilized or are not being managed effectively.

3. Sequence of Events: The sequence of events appears to have an impact on performance. For instance, the event "Load to Vehicle" -> "Weigh" has a very short duration (0.00), which could imply that the weighing operation is not always happening after loading, leading to potential inefficiencies.

4. Resource Allocation: In the Transport Document section, events like "Depart" have a long duration and are repeated frequently, suggesting that resources (vehicles or containers) might not be allocated optimally.

5. Lack of Efficiency in Rescheduling: The high frequency of rescheduling events ("Reschedule Container") across different stages of the process indicates a potential issue with planning or execution, leading to performance problems.

6. Inefficient Use of Customer Orders and Transport Documents: The "Register Customer Order" event has a high frequency but is only followed by one main event ("Create Transport Document"). If other steps are not being adequately addressed after the creation of the transport document, this could lead to bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

To address these issues, consider optimizing resource allocation, improving the sequence of events, and examining the reasons behind frequent rescheduling. Additionally, analyze whether there are opportunities for parallelization or automation to increase efficiency throughout the process.
