To solve this problem, we need to analyze an event log to identify the most frequent process variants and retrieve all events related to these top variants. Here's the structured approach:

### Approach
1. **Generate Process Variants**: For each case, we aggregate activities in chronological order to form a unique variant.
2. **Count Variants**: Group cases by their variants and count occurrences to determine popularity.
3. **Rank Variants**: Use ranking to identify the top K variants based on their frequency.
4. **Filter Events**: Retrieve all events from cases that belong to the top K variants.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH CaseVariants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',') OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
),
VariantCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) AS case_count
    FROM CaseVariants
    GROUP BY variant
),
RankedVariants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant, 
        case_count, 
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM VariantCounts
),
TopKVariants AS (
    SELECT variant 
    FROM RankedVariants 
    WHERE rank <= K  -- Replace K with your desired top N (e.g., 3)
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT cv.case_id 
    FROM CaseVariants cv
    WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM TopKVariants)
);
```

### Explanation
1. **CaseVariants CTE**: This uses a window function to create a comma-separated string of activities for each case, ordered by timestamp. This string represents a process variant.
2. **VariantCounts CTE**: Groups by the generated variant strings and counts the number of unique cases for each variant.
3. **RankedVariants CTE**: Assigns a rank to each variant based on its case count, ensuring the most frequent variants are at the top.
4. **TopKVariants CTE**: Selects the top K variants by filtering ranked results.
5. **Final Query**: Retrieves all events from the original log where the case_id belongs to any case in the top K variants, ensuring only relevant events are included.

This approach efficiently processes the event log, identifies key process patterns, and extracts pertinent data for further analysis.
