Why each label was chosen  
------------------------------------------------
1. Idle / Machine Warm-up (Events 1-3)  
   • Very low temperature (20–21 °C), vibration 0 Hz, no material flow, tool at home (0 mm).  
   • Just enough energy (0.4–0.5 kWh) to keep electronics alive – typical “powered-on but waiting” condition.

2. Cutting Metal (Events 4-6)  
   • Rapid rise in temperature (50  58 °C) and vibration (30  38 Hz).  
   • Continuous material flow of 5 units/s – likely coolant or chips being removed.  
   • Tool position advances from 5  10 mm, showing the tool is moving through material.  
   • Energy jumps to 2–3 kWh, consistent with a high-power spindle or saw.

3. Assembling Parts (Events 7-8)  
   • Temperature and vibration drop to moderate, steady levels (40 °C, 10 Hz).  
   • Material flow falls to 2 units/s – e.g., pneumatic fasteners or adhesive feed.  
   • Tool position stabilises at 15 mm (end of cut, beginning of jointing).  
   • Pressure rises to 2 bar, suggesting pneumatic tools used for fitting parts together.

4. Welding (Event 9)  
   • Sharp temperature spike to 80 °C and vibration peak to 50 Hz while tool position stays fixed (15 mm).  
   • Highest single-step energy usage (5 kWh) – typical of a welding arc.  
   • No material flow (0 units/s): welding wire is fed internally, not measured by the “material flow” sensor.

5. Cool-down / Transition (Event 10)  
   • Temperature quickly drops to 30 °C, vibration almost zero, no material flow.  
   • Energy consumption falls to 1 kWh.  
   • Looks like a brief pause to let the weld cool before the next operation.

6. Quality Inspection (Events 11-12)  
   • Low temperature (25 °C) and modest vibration (5 Hz) – indicative of probes or vision systems moving, not heavy tooling.  
   • Small material flow (1 unit/s) could be compressed air for cleaning or sensors.  
   • Tool position extends to 20 mm to reach inspection points.  
   • Moderate energy (1.5 kWh) matches sensor lighting, cameras, or probes.

7. Return-to-Home / Idle (Events 13-15)  
   • All readings return to baseline: temperature 20–21 °C, vibration 0 Hz, material flow 0, tool position resets to 0 mm, minimal energy.  
   • Represents either the end of the job or readiness for the next part.

Notes
------------------------------------------------
• A distinct “Packaging” phase is not visible in the current log; if present it would likely show moderate, sustained material flow (wrapping film, taping) and tool movements different from those recorded.  
• The segmentation was done purely from sensor patterns—no manual timestamps were used—mimicking an unsupervised process-mining approach.
