In the table below every consecutive block of events that shows a homogeneous sensorprofile is treated as one “phase”.  
For each phase I give (1) the events that belong to it, (2) the activity label I assign, and (3) the main evidence that drove the decision.


PHASE 1 – Machine Idle / Setup  
• Events: 1 – 3  
• Evidence  
  – Lowest temperature (2021 °C) and pressure (1 bar).  
  – Zero vibration, zero material flow, tool at home position (0 mm).  
  – Very small standby electricity (0.40.5 kWh).  
   Nothing is being processed yet; the machine is simply powered on and ready.


PHASE 2 – Cutting Metal  
• Events: 4 – 6  
• Evidence  
  – Sudden rise in temperature (50  58 °C) and vibration (30  38 Hz).  
  – Continuous material flow of 5 units/s (typical for coolant or chip removal).  
  – Tool advances from 5 mm to 10 mm—consistent with cutting into stock.  
  – Energy demand jumps to 23 kWh.  
   Classic signature of a highspeed materialremoval operation.


PHASE 3 – Assembling Parts  
• Events: 7 – 8  
• Evidence  
  – Temperature falls to a stable 40 °C and vibration drops to 10 Hz (lighter load than cutting).  
  – Hydraulic / pneumatic pressure climbs to 2 bar, suggesting clamping or pressing.  
  – Lower, steady material flow (2 units/s) could be adhesive or compressedair.  
  – Tool position reaches 15 mm and then holds—typical when two parts are brought together and fixed.  
  – Moderate energy (2 kWh).  
   Readings match a fastening or assembly step.


PHASE 4 – Welding  
• Event: 9  
• Evidence  
  – Sharp peak in temperature to 80 °C and the highest vibration level (50 Hz).  
  – Energy spikes to 5 kWh—consistent with an electric arc or resistance weld.  
  – No material flow (0 units/s) because welding wire/filler is not measured by the flow sensor.  
  – Pressure remains at the clamping level (2 bar).  
   Signature strongly matches a short, energydense welding operation.


PHASE 5 – Cooling / Transition  
• Event: 10  
• Evidence  
  – Temperature quickly drops to 30 °C and vibration to almost zero (1 Hz).  
  – Energy and pressure return to nearidle levels.  
   Machine pauses briefly to cool the weld before the next step.


PHASE 6 – Quality Inspection  
• Events: 11 – 12  
• Evidence  
  – Low temperature (25 °C) and lowmoderate vibration (5 Hz); no heavy processing.  
  – Small, regular material flow (1 unit/s) suggests an optical/air scanner cleaning the surface.  
  – Tool makes small probing moves (20 mm).  
  – Energy only 1.51.6 kWh.  
   Conditions match a sensorbased inspection pass.


PHASE 7 – Return to Idle / Standby  
• Events: 13 – 15  
• Evidence  
  – All readings revert to the same nearzero levels seen in Phase 1 (temperature 2021 °C, vibration 0 Hz, no flow, tool home).  
  – Minimal standby energy.  
   The machine has finished the job and is awaiting the next order.

These labels transform the raw numeric event log into a humanreadable manufacturing process model that could now be used for further processmining analysis (e.g., frequency, duration, conformance).
