Below is the Python code that constructs the POWL model for the described complex digital service provisioning process:
```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Initial Service Request Verification and Contract Setup
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# 2. Parallel Tasks after Contract Setup
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
# Partial Order for DA and ACI (no direct order, hence no add_edge needed here)

# 3. Looped Configuration Phase
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
D_R = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
config_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# 4. Exclusive Choice for Deployment
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# 5. Final Tasks before Go-Live (Partial Order)
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
# Partial Order for QA and SA will be defined in the root structure

# 6. Final Go-Live Approval
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Constructing the POWL Model with Appropriate Partial Orders
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, config_loop, deployment_choice, QA, SA, GLA])

# Defining the Execution Order
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # SR before CS
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)   # CS before DA
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)  # CS before ACI
root.order.add_edge(DA, config_loop)  # DA before config_loop (implies ACI also before due to DA and ACI's parallel nature and the subsequent dependency)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, config_loop)  # Explicit for clarity, though implied by DA's dependency in this modeled structure
root.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_choice)  # Loop before deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, QA)  # Deployment before QA
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, SA)  # Deployment before SA
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)  # QA before GLA
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)  # SA before GLA

# Note: The parallel nature of QA and SA is implicitly modeled by not adding an edge between them, allowing for concurrent execution.
```
**Key Points in the Implementation:**

- **Parallel Tasks (DA & ACI):** No direct edge is added between them, reflecting their ability to execute concurrently after `CS`.
  
- **Looped Configuration:** `Operator.LOOP` correctly models the repeatable `BNC` and `D&R` process until stable.

- **Exclusive Deployment Choice:** `Operator.XOR` ensures only one of `CD` or `MD` is executed.

- **Final Tasks (QA & SA):** Modeled to run concurrently before `GLA` by not specifying an order between them but requiring both to precede `GLA`.

- **Dependencies:**
  - Explicit dependencies are set for sequential steps (e.g., `SR`->`CS`, `CS`->`DA`/`ACI`, etc.).
  - Implicit dependency for `ACI`->`config_loop` is covered by `DA`->`config_loop` due to the required completion of both `DA` and `ACI` before proceeding, but an explicit edge is added for clarity.

**Example Use Case (Simulation/Simplification for Illustration):**

To simulate or visualize this POWL model (simplified for illustration), you might use `pm4py` for simulation and visualization libraries like `graphviz` for a graphical representation. Note that full simulation and visualization code is not provided here due to the focus on the POWL model construction:

```python
# Simplified Illustration for Visualization (Actual Simulation Requires More Setup)
import graphviz

# ... (Assuming the above POWL model is constructed as 'root')

dot = graphviz.Digraph()
for node in root.nodes:
    if isinstance(node, OperatorPOWL):
        if node.operator == Operator.LOOP:
            dot.node(str(id(node)), 'LOOP\n' + '\n'.join([n.label for n in node.children]), shape="box")
        elif node.operator == Operator.XOR:
            dot.node(str(id(node)), 'XOR\n' + '\n'.join([n.label for n in node.children]), shape="box")
    elif isinstance(node, Transition) or isinstance(node, SilentTransition):
        dot.node(str(id(node)), node.label if node.label else '', shape="circle" if node.label else "circle,filled,style=filled,color=lightgrey")
    
for source, target in root.order.edges:
    dot.edge(str(id(source)), str(id(target)))

dot.render("provisioning_process", view=True)
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Visualization/Simulation:** The provided visualization snippet is highly simplified. For a comprehensive simulation or detailed visualization, consider using `pm4py`’s simulation capabilities and more advanced `graphviz` customizations.
- **Error Handling & Edge Cases:** This model assumes ideal execution paths. In a real-world scenario, adding error handling for failed tasks or loops without termination conditions would be crucial.
- **Dependencies & Parallelism:** The model carefully balances sequential dependencies with parallel execution where applicable, ensuring the process's complexity is accurately represented.
