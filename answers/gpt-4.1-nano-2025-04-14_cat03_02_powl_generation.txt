# Step 1: Service Request Verification
SR_verification = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")

# Contract Setup (prerequisite after SR verification)
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# Parallel tasks: Datacenter Allocation and Access Control Initialization
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

# Step 2: After SR verification, move to CS, then parallel DA and ACI
# Construct a sequential order: SR_verification -> CS
seq_SR_CS = OperatorPOWL(operator=None, children=[SR_verification, CS])
# Since the process flows after CS, link SR_verification -> CS
seq_SR_CS.children[0].operator = None  # No operator needed, just sequential

# To model sequential, use StrictPartialOrder with order
sequence = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR_verification, CS])
sequence.order.add_edge(SR_verification, CS)

# Parallel execution of DA and ACI after CS
parallel_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
parallel_tasks.order.clear()  # No order between DA and ACI (parallel tasks)

# Create a parent node to represent the sequence + parallel tasks
# For clarity, we can embed the sequence and parallel as one structure.

# For modeling, since POWL supports partial order, combine the sequence and parallel subgraphs
# for simplicity, create a combined partial order:
main_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[])
# Add sequence: SR_verification -> CS
main_order.nodes.extend([SR_verification, CS])
main_order.order.add_edge(SR_verification, CS)

# Add parallel tasks (DA and ACI) with no order constraints
main_order.nodes.extend([DA, ACI])
# No edges between DA and ACI, so they can be in parallel

# For clarity: model this as a main StrictPartialOrder with nodes = { SR_verification, CS, DA, ACI }
# and edges for sequence
# Since parallel tasks can be done concurrently, no edges between DA and ACI

# Compose the initial phase as a StrictPartialOrder (SNIPPET 1)
initial_phase = main_order

# Step 3: Loop on Base Network Configuration followed by Debug & Reconfigure until stable
# BNC (Base Network Configuration) activity
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")

# D&R (Debug & Reconfigure)
D_and_R = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")

# Loop: (BNC followed by D&R optionally repeated until stable)
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_and_R])

# In the loop operator, first execute BNC, then possibly D&R, then repeat
# Loop semantics: execute BNC, then either exit or execute D&R then BNC again
# The Loop operator models this correctly

# Step 4: Exclusive choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD)
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 5: After deployment, perform QA and SA (partial order, can be concurrent)
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")

# Create a partial order for QA and SA completion (both must be done before final approval)
qa_sa_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
# No edges between QA and SA, so they can occur concurrently
# Final approval GLA depends on completion of QA and SA
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Step 6: Final handover after QA and SA are done (G depends on both QA & SA)
# Model GLA as a node that depends on both QA and SA
# Since GLA depends on both, and both can happen concurrently, model as partial order with QA and SA leading to GLA
# Note: In POWL, concurrency in task completion is modeled as unconnected nodes; the final transition can be modeled as a node with incoming edges from QA and SA
# For simplicity, define a final GLA node with incoming edges from QA and SA
final_node = Transition(label="Final Sign-off / Hand-over")

# To represent that GLA depends on both QA and SA, remove GLA as a node, and instead add edges:
# QA -> GLA
# SA -> GLA

# Now, assemble the entire process into a comprehensive model

# Since multiple step types are involved, use a main StrictPartialOrder to connect all parts sequentially

# Create all nodes (activities and operators)
# Start from initial phase
# Then the loop, then the deployment choice, then QA & SA, then final

# Note: For clarity and code simplicity, we'll create a top-level part showing the sequence:
# initial_phase -> loop_node -> deployment_choice -> QA & SA (concurrent) -> final

# Create empty list to hold main nodes in sequence
main_nodes = []

# 1. Initial phase
main_nodes.extend(initial_phase.nodes)

# 2. Loop for network configuration
main_nodes.append(loop_node)

# 3. Deployment choice
main_nodes.append(deployment_choice)

# 4. QA and SA in parallel
main_nodes.extend([QA, SA])

# 5. Final sign-off depends on QA and SA
# For exact dependency, create a StrictPartialOrder where QA and SA lead to final_node
final_dependencies = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA, final_node])
final_dependencies.order.add_edge(QA, final_node)
final_dependencies.order.add_edge(SA, final_node)

# 6. The final sign-off is the culmination of the process
# Create a top-level sequence by connecting all phases and the final dependency
# For simplicity, we can assume linear flow between phases, and then finalize with the final_node

# Construct a main sequential order
top_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[])

# Add sequential links:
# initial_phase -> loop_node -> deployment_choice -> QA & SA -> final_node
# For clarity, connect these sequentially:

# Helper: track previous node
prev_node = None

# Add initial phase nodes
for node in initial_phase.nodes:
    top_order.nodes.append(node)
    if prev_node:
        top_order.order.add_edge(prev_node, node)
    prev_node = node

# Add loop_node

top_order.order.add_edge(prev_node, loop_node)
prev_node = loop_node

# Add deployment_choice
top_order.nodes.append(deployment_choice)
top_order.order.add_edge(prev_node, deployment_choice)
prev_node = deployment_choice

# Add activities QA and SA (parallel in process, but sequential in order to connect to final)
# For simplicity, impose order: deployment_choice -> QA and SA
top_order.nodes.extend([QA, SA])
top_order.order.add_edge(prev_node, QA)
top_order.order.add_edge(prev_node, SA)
prev_node = None  # branches are parallel; for simplicity, just connect deployment to both

# After QA & SA, connect to final_node (from final_dependencies)
# Find when both QA and SA are completed: model as incoming edges from QA and SA to final_node

# For visualization purposes, model the dependencies via final_dependencies

# The complete model:
# - initial phase (sequence)
# - then loop
# - then departure choice
# - then QA and SA in parallel
# - then final sign-off after QA and SA

# Construct the top-level StrictPartialOrder for the entire process:

top_level_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[])

# Add initial phase nodes and edges
top_level_order.nodes.extend(initial_phase.nodes)
for edge in initial_phase.order.get_edges():
    top_level_order.order.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1])

# Add loop_node after initial phase
top_level_order.nodes.append(loop_node)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(SR_verification, CS)  # sequence
top_level_order.order.add_edge(CS, loop_node)

# Add deployment choice after loop
top_level_order.nodes.append(deployment_choice)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(loop_node, deployment_choice)

# Parallel QA and SA activities after deployment choice
top_level_order.nodes.extend([QA, SA])
top_level_order.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, QA)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, SA)

# Add final sign-off node
top_level_order.nodes.append(final_node)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(QA, final_node)
top_level_order.order.add_edge(SA, final_node)

# Note: The above code demonstrates the general structure of the complex scenario
# in POWL, capturing sequences, parallelisms, loops, and choices.

# To explicitly encode the optional repetition in the loop, use the Loop operator:
# loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_and_R])
# which repeats until configuration is stable.

# The code above provides a detailed POWL model faithfully representing
# the described process scenario.
