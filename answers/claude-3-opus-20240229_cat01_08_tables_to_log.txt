Assumptions made:
- Each order creation is treated as a separate event, derived from the Orders table.  
- Item picking events are derived from the Order Lines table, with one event per line. The assumption is picking each line is a meaningful activity.
- Order dispatch and arrival events come from the Delivery table. If an order has multiple deliveries, each is treated as a separate event.
- Invoice and payment events come from their respective tables. Multiple payments/invoices per order are accounted for.
- Resources are mapped from the relevant IDs where possible. Payment resource is left blank as no mapping provided.
- Additional attributes like customer type, priority, item details, amounts, methods are included where relevant to the event.
- Chronological order is maintained based on the timestamp logic described.
