<think>
Okay, I need to write a DuckDB SQL query that does a few things. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the task is to find the process variants, which are the ordered sequences of activities per case. So for each case_id, I need to get the activities in the order of their timestamps. Then group cases by these sequences to find unique variants. Then count how many cases are in each variant, find the top K, and return all events from those cases.

Let me start with the first part: getting the ordered sequence of activities per case. For each case_id, I need to sort the events by timestamp and then collect the activities in that order. In SQL, I think I can use the array_agg function with an order by clause. So something like array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) for each case_id.

Once I have that, I can create a CTE (Common Table Expression) that has each case_id along with its sequence. Then, I need to group by this sequence to find unique variants. But how to handle that? Because the sequence is an array, grouping by it directly might work, but I need to check if DuckDB allows that. I think it does, but maybe I need to use a hash or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can convert the array to a string to make grouping easier. But the problem says to group by the complete activity sequence, so maybe using the array as is is okay.

Next, I need to count the number of cases per variant. So after grouping by the sequence, I can count the number of case_ids. Then, I need to find the top K variants by frequency. That would involve ordering by the count in descending order and taking the first K.

But then, how to get the case_ids that belong to these top K variants? Because once I have the top K variants, I need to filter the original event_log to include only those cases.

So here's a plan:

1. For each case_id, generate the ordered activity sequence. Let's call this a CTE called case_sequences.
2. Then, aggregate these sequences to count how many cases are in each variant. Let's call this CTE variant_counts.
3. From variant_counts, select the top K variants (maybe using a window function or LIMIT K after ordering).
4. Then, get the case_ids that are part of these top K variants.
5. Finally, join this back to the original event_log to get all events from those cases.

But how to implement this in SQL?

Let me think about the first CTE. For case_sequences:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)

Then, variant_counts would be:

WITH variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
)

Wait, but if I do that, I can't directly use LIMIT K unless I know K. But the problem says to determine the top K variants. However, the user probably wants the query to be parameterized with K. But since the query is to be written as a static SQL, maybe K is a placeholder. However, the user might want the query to accept K as a parameter. But the problem says to return the top K variants, so the query should have a way to specify K. But in the final query, perhaps the user will replace K with a number. But for the purpose of writing the query, I can use a placeholder.

But in DuckDB, the LIMIT clause can take a parameter. So assuming that K is a parameter, the query would have LIMIT K.

But then, how to get the case_ids that belong to these top K variants? Because variant_counts has the activity_sequence, but to get the case_ids, I need to go back to case_sequences where the activity_sequence is in the top K.

So perhaps:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants)

Wait, but the problem says to return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. So the final query is selecting all events where the case_id is part of the top K variants.

But how to get the case_ids that are in the top K variants. So the top_variants CTE has the activity_sequences of the top K. Then, case_sequences has the case_id and their activity_sequence. So we can join case_sequences with top_variants on activity_sequence, and then get the case_ids. Then, join that with the original event_log.

Alternatively, perhaps:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM variant_counts)
)

But variant_counts is the top K variants. So that would work.

But what about the order? Because in the variant_counts CTE, we have the top K variants. But in the query above, the subquery would get all the activity_sequences from variant_counts, which are the top K.

But how to make sure that the variant_counts is correctly calculated. Also, the variant_counts CTE is ordered by count DESC and limited to K. But when you do that, the variant_counts would have the top K variants.

But in DuckDB, when you do a GROUP BY and ORDER BY, then LIMIT, the result is the top K.

So putting it all together, the full query would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
top_variant_sequences AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variant_sequences)

But wait, the problem says to return all events from the original event_log that belong to cases in the top K variants. So the above query does that.

But what about the case where multiple variants have the same count? For example, if K is 3 and there are 3 variants with the same count. But the problem says to take the top K, so the LIMIT K would take the first K.

But the user might need to adjust K. However, in the query, K is a placeholder. But in practice, the user would replace K with a number.

But the problem says to write the query. So the final query would have K as a parameter. However, in DuckDB, you can use a parameter like :K, but the exact syntax depends on how it's called. But for the purpose of the SQL query, perhaps the user is supposed to write it with a LIMIT K, assuming that K is a variable.

But the problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So the query must have a way to specify K. However, in the final SQL, the user would need to replace K with a number. So the query would have LIMIT K.

But in DuckDB, the LIMIT clause can take a parameter. So the query is correct.

But let me check for possible errors.

First, the case_sequences CTE: grouping by case_id and aggregating the activities ordered by timestamp. That's correct.

Then, variant_counts groups by activity_sequence (which is an array) and counts the number of case_ids per sequence. Then orders by count descending and limits to K.

Then, the top_variant_sequences is just the activity_sequences of the top K.

Then, the final select joins the original event_log with case_sequences on case_id, and checks if the activity_sequence is in the top_variant_sequences.

Yes, that should work.

But what about if two different case_ids have the same activity_sequence? That's okay, because they would be grouped into the same variant.

Another thing: the activity_sequence is an array. In DuckDB, when you do array_agg, it's stored as an array. So when you compare arrays, they are compared element-wise. So grouping by activity_sequence should work.

But what if the activity_sequence is a large array? But DuckDB should handle that.

Another possible issue: the order of the array. Since the array is created with ORDER BY timestamp, the sequence is correct.

Now, the problem says to return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. So the final query is correct.

But what if the same case_id is in multiple variants? No, each case_id has exactly one variant, because it's grouped by case_id in case_sequences.

So the query should work.

But let me think about possible edge cases. For example, if K is larger than the number of unique variants. Then, the LIMIT K would just return all variants. But that's acceptable.

Another thing: the variant_counts CTE is ordered by count DESC, so the top K are the most frequent.

Now, putting all together, the SQL query would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants);

But in DuckDB, the LIMIT K would require that K is a parameter. However, if the user wants to make it a variable, they can replace K with a value. But the problem says "top K variants", so the query should include that.

But maybe the user wants to have the query with a specific K, but since the problem says "top K", the query should have K as a placeholder.

But the problem says "the top K variants by their frequency". So the query must include a way to specify K. However, in SQL, you can't have a parameter in the query unless you use a placeholder. But for the purpose of this problem, the answer should have the query with LIMIT K, assuming that K is provided.

But maybe the user wants to have the query with a specific value. However, the problem doesn't specify K, so it's left as a variable.

Another thing: the variant_counts CTE is using GROUP BY activity_sequence. But activity_sequence is an array. In DuckDB, arrays can be used in GROUP BY. Let me check the DuckDB documentation. Yes, DuckDB allows grouping by arrays.

Therefore, this should work.

Another possible optimization: instead of using a CTE for top_variants, we can use a subquery directly in the WHERE clause.

But the current structure is correct.

So the final query should be as written above.

But let me check for possible syntax errors. For example, in DuckDB, the array_agg function is available. Yes, DuckDB supports array_agg with ORDER BY.

Yes, the syntax is correct.

Another thing: the case_sequences CTE is needed to get the activity_sequence per case. Then, the variant_counts groups by that sequence. Then, the top variants are selected. Then, the events are selected by joining with case_sequences.

Yes.

So this should be the correct query.

To solve the problem of identifying and filtering events based on the **top K process variants**, we need to follow a structured approach using DuckDB. The key steps are:

1. **Generate the ordered activity sequence per case** using `array_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp`.
2. **Group cases by their activity sequence** to determine unique process variants.
3. **Count the frequency of each variant** and select the top K by frequency.
4. **Filter the original event log** to include only events from cases that belong to the top K variants.

Here is the complete and well-documented DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes this:

---

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    -- Step 1: For each case, generate the ordered sequence of activities by timestamp
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

variant_counts AS (
    -- Step 2: Count how many cases belong to each variant
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K  -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
),

top_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Extract the activity sequences of the top K variants
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
)

-- Step 4: Retrieve all events from cases that belong to the top K variants
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_sequences cs ON e.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants);
```

###  Explanation of Key Components

- **`array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`**: This ensures that for each `case_id`, the activities are ordered according to the timestamp, forming the process variant.
  
- **`GROUP BY activity_sequence`**: Since `activity_sequence` is an array, this groups the cases by their exact sequence of activities, identifying unique process variants.

- **`LIMIT K`**: This clause restricts the result to the top K most frequent variants based on the count of cases.

- **`JOIN` and `WHERE`**: These are used to filter the original `event_log` to only include events from cases that belong to the top K variants.

---

###  Notes

- Replace `K` with the actual number of top variants you want to retrieve (e.g., `LIMIT 5`).
- This query assumes that `event_log` is a table with the specified columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`.
- The use of arrays for `activity_sequence` is supported in DuckDB and ensures that the order of activities is preserved during grouping.

This query is efficient, readable, and follows best practices for working with process mining data in DuckDB. It ensures accurate identification of process variants and filtering of events accordingly.
