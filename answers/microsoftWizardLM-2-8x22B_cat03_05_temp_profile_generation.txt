 To construct a representative subset of the temporal profile for the global supply chain process, we need to consider the nature of each activity and the typical delays that might occur between them. Since we are not providing explicit numerical temporal information, I will estimate these times based on a general understanding of supply chain processes. The actual numbers could vary significantly based on real-world data.

Here is an estimated temporal profile for a subset of activity pairs:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Supplier and procurement activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (2*86400, 24*3600),  # Average 2 days to select a supplier and place an order, with a standard deviation of 1 day.
    ('OP', 'RC'): (7*86400, 3*86400),   # Average 1 week to receive components, with a standard deviation of 3 days.
    # Quality and assembly activities
    ('RC', 'QI'): (2*86400, 24*3600),   # Average 2 days for quality inspection, with a standard deviation of 1 day.
    ('QI', 'CA'): (3*86400, 2*86400),  # Average 3 days to assemble components, with a standard deviation of 2 days.
    # Testing and packaging activities
    ('CA', 'PT'): (4*86400, 2*86400),  # Average 4 days for product testing, with a standard deviation of 2 days.
    ('PT', 'PK'): (1*86400, 12*3600),  # Average 1 day for packaging, with a standard deviation of 12 hours.
    # Storage and distribution activities
    ('PK', 'WS'): (5*86400, 3*86400),   # Average 5 days of warehouse storage before distribution, with a standard deviation of 3 days.
    ('WS', 'DT'): (1*86400, 12*3600),  # Average 1 day for distribution, with a standard deviation of 12 hours.
    # After-sales activities (note that this may happen much later and has a large variance)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (30*86400, 60*86400),  # Average 30 days until after-sales support is required, with a large standard deviation of 60 days.
    # Skip-step relationships (complexity consideration)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (9*86400, 4*86400),  # Average time from supplier selection to quality inspection, with a standard deviation of 4 days.
    ('OP', 'PT'): (14*86400, 5*86400), # Average time from order placement to product testing, with a standard deviation of 5 days.
    ('RC', 'PK'): (10*86400, 4*86400), # Average time from receiving components to packaging, with a standard deviation of 4 days.
    ('QI', 'WS'): (8*86400, 4*86400),  # Average time from quality inspection to warehouse storage, with a standard deviation of 4 days.
    ('CA', 'AS'): (40*86400, 70*86400),# Average time from component assembly to after-sales support, with a standard deviation of 70 days.
}
```

In this dictionary, the keys are tuples representing pairs of activities, and the values are tuples of the average time in seconds and the standard deviation, also in seconds. The average times and standard deviations are estimated based on typical durations for each activity in a supply chain context, considering the complexity and variability inherent in global supply chains. The standard deviations are intentionally large to reflect the uncertainty and variability in real-world processes.

Please note that these estimates are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes. In a real-world scenario, these numbers would be derived from historical data and statistical analysis of the actual process executions.
