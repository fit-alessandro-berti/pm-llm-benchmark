The visualization you’ve provided appears to illustrate how two related “prolect classes” (essentially two distinct but interacting process classes) communicate and coordinate to carry out a medical laboratory procedure. Let’s break it down into the three parts shown: (a), (b), and (c).

**(a) Two prolect classes connected through two channels**  
This part shows a scenario where two main processes—**"Lab visit"** and **"Lab test"**—interact with each other through defined communication channels, such as an **Order system** and a **Hospital Information System (HIS)**.

1. **Lab Visit Prolect Class (left side)**:  
   - Starts when a patient visits the lab.
   - A doctor or lab assistant orders a test (e.g., a blood sample is taken).
   - The order is placed into the Order system, which serves as a communication intermediary.
   - The blood sample and the request for a certain test (like an HGB test) flow from the “Lab visit” side into the system.

2. **Order and Result Flow (middle section)**:  
   - The request for a test is sent to the lab test side through the Order system.
   - Once the lab test is performed, results are returned and can pass through the HIS or the Order system back to the “Lab visit” side.
   - If results are not satisfactory or if more information is needed, a new iteration of testing can be initiated.
   
3. **Lab Test Prolect Class (right side)**:  
   - Receives the request from the Order system.
   - A chemical analyst performs the requested laboratory test.
   - The test results are compiled into a report.
   - If necessary, the test can be repeated. Once final results are available, they are sent back to the "Lab visit" process.

4. **End States**:  
   - On the "Lab visit" side, if all results are fine, a final report is sent out.
   - On the "Lab test" side, once the testing is complete, the process concludes with the final report being communicated back.

This diagram shows a loop of actions and responses: ordering a test, performing the test, judging the results, possibly retesting, and eventually issuing a final report.

**(b) Class diagram containing the two prolect classes**  
This smaller diagram conceptually represents the relationship between the two classes (“Lab visit” and “Lab test”):

- It indicates that a single “Lab visit” may require one or many “Lab tests.”
- The notation "1..1 requires 1..*" suggests that every lab visit requires at least one lab test, and potentially more if retesting is needed.

This is a structural view, showing how instances of these classes are related in the overall process model.

**(c) Example of a performative**  
This table provides an example of a specific message or “performative” within the communication process. It shows:

- **Time**: When the message is sent (e.g., 11:00).
- **Channel**: Through which system the message travels (Order system, HIS, etc.).
- **Sender**: Which prolect class (e.g., Lab visit) initiates the action.
- **Receiver(s)**: The target (e.g., Lab test).
- **Action**: What the message is asking for. In the example, the action is “Create” (a new lab test request).
- **Content**: The actual request (e.g., “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”).
- **Scope** and **Direction**: The nature of the communication (private/public, inbound/outbound).

This table shows how the abstract elements in the diagram translate into concrete communicative acts—requests, responses, updates—that drive the process forward.

**Overall Purpose of the Visualization**  
This integrated set of diagrams and tables is providing:

- A process view (in (a)) that shows the dynamic interaction and the iterative nature of requesting and performing lab tests.
- A structural view (in (b)) showing the relationship between the “Lab visit” and “Lab test” prolect classes.
- A message-level view (in (c)) illustrating how these processes talk to each other with specific performative messages.

In other words, the visualization is a high-level, conceptual model of how clinical laboratory work can be orchestrated using a combination of process classes, communication channels, and message-based interactions. It shows not just the tasks and their sequence but also how information flows between different actors and systems involved in delivering and reporting test results.
