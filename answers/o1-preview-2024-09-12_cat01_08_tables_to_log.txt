**Assumptions and Notes:**

- For "Order Created" events, the assigned resource is the Sales Person who handled the order.
- Each "Item Picked" event represents the picking of an individual item, with the picker identified as the resource.
- Multiple deliveries for an order are recorded as separate "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events.
- "Invoice Issued" events include the billing person as the resource, along with invoice details.
- "Payment Received" events are recorded without a specific resource since payer details are not specified.
- For order 1004, no delivery, invoice, or payment information is available; the process seems incomplete or data may be missing.
