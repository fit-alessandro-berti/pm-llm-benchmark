Based on the complex product design and launch scenario, I'll construct a DECLARE model that captures the logical dependencies and constraints between activities. Here's a comprehensive Python dictionary representing the process:

```python
declare_model = {
    # Existence constraints (activities that must occur)
    'existence': {
        'Idea Generation (IG)': [1.0, 0.95],  # Must happen in most cases
        'Design Draft (DD)': [1.0, 0.90],      # Usually required
        'Approval Gate (AG)': [1.0, 0.85],     # Critical checkpoint
        'Final Launch (FL)': [1.0, 0.80]       # Ultimate goal (though not all products launch)
    },
    
    # Absence constraints (activities that should not occur)
    'absence': {},  # All activities are allowed in this process
    
    # Exactly one occurrence
    'exactly_one': {
        'Final Launch (FL)': [1.0, 0.95],      # Product launches exactly once if successful
        'Approval Gate (AG)': [1.0, 0.90]      # Single approval gate per product
    },
    
    # Init constraint (must be first activity)
    'init': {
        'Idea Generation (IG)': [1.0, 1.0]     # Process always starts with idea generation
    },
    
    # Responded existence (if A happens, B must happen eventually)
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Design Draft (DD)', 'Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)'): [1.0, 0.95],
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'Laboratory Testing (LT)'): [1.0, 0.98],
        ('User Testing (UT)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): [1.0, 0.90],
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): [1.0, 0.85]
    },
    
    # Coexistence (A happens iff B happens)
    'coexistence': {
        ('Laboratory Testing (LT)', 'User Testing (UT)'): [1.0, 0.92],  # Both tests usually go together
        ('Marketing Plan (MP)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): [1.0, 0.95]       # Marketing needed for launch
    },
    
    # Response (A must be eventually followed by B)
    'response': {
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Design Draft (DD)'): [1.0, 0.95],
        ('Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 'Cost Evaluation (CE)'): [1.0, 0.88],
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'Laboratory Testing (LT)'): [1.0, 0.98],
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Marketing Plan (MP)'): [1.0, 0.90]
    },
    
    # Precedence (B can only happen if A happened before)
    'precedence': {
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Design Draft (DD)'): [1.0, 1.0],
        ('Design Draft (DD)', 'Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)'): [1.0, 0.98],
        ('Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): [1.0, 0.95],
        ('Laboratory Testing (LT)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): [1.0, 0.92],
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): [1.0, 1.0]
    },
    
    # Succession (A must be followed by B and B requires A before)
    'succession': {
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Design Draft (DD)'): [1.0, 0.95],
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'Laboratory Testing (LT)'): [1.0, 0.96],
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Marketing Plan (MP)'): [1.0, 0.88]
    },
    
    # Alternate response (A must be followed by B before A can occur again)
    'altresponse': {
        ('Design Draft (DD)', 'Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)'): [1.0, 0.94],
        ('Cost Evaluation (CE)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): [1.0, 0.85]
    },
    
    # Alternate precedence (B requires A, and between A and B, A cannot reoccur)
    'altprecedence': {
        ('Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): [1.0, 0.92],
        ('User Testing (UT)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): [1.0, 0.90]
    },
    
    # Alternate succession (combination of altresponse and altprecedence)
    'altsuccession': {
        ('Laboratory Testing (LT)', 'User Testing (UT)'): [1.0, 0.88],
        ('Marketing Plan (MP)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): [1.0, 0.92]
    },
    
    # Chain response (A must be immediately followed by B)
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 'Cost Evaluation (CE)'): [1.0, 0.85],
        ('User Testing (UT)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): [1.0, 0.82]
    },
    
    # Chain precedence (B must be immediately preceded by A)
    'chainprecedence': {
        ('Laboratory Testing (LT)', 'User Testing (UT)'): [1.0, 0.80],
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Marketing Plan (MP)'): [1.0, 0.78]
    },
    
    # Chain succession (A immediately followed by B and vice versa)
    'chainsuccession': {
        ('Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 'Cost Evaluation (CE)'): [1.0, 0.75]
    },
    
    # Non-coexistence (A and B cannot both occur)
    'noncoexistence': {},  # All activities can coexist in this process
    
    # Non-succession (A cannot be followed by B)
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Final Launch (FL)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): [1.0, 0.98],  # Can't prototype after launch
        ('Final Launch (FL)', 'Design Draft (DD)'): [1.0, 0.99]         # Can't redesign after launch
    },
    
    # Non-chain succession (A cannot be immediately followed by B)
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): [1.0, 1.0],      # Can't jump to launch
        ('Design Draft (DD)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): [1.0, 0.98],        # Many steps in between
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): [1.0, 0.96] # Need design first
    }
}
```

This DECLARE model captures the following key business rules:

1. **Sequential flow**: Ideas must be generated first, followed by design, feasibility checks, prototyping, testing, approval, and finally launch
2. **Testing requirements**: Prototypes must undergo both lab and user testing before approval
3. **Approval gates**: Management approval is required before marketing and launch
4. **Dependencies**: Technical feasibility must be verified before prototyping, and costs must be evaluated
5. **Marketing alignment**: Marketing plans are developed after approval and before launch
6. **Process integrity**: Once launched, the product doesn't go back to earlier design phases

The confidence values reflect the likelihood of these rules being followed, with critical dependencies having higher confidence scores.
