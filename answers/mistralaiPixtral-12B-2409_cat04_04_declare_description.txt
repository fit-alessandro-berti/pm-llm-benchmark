Based on the provided declarative process model constraints, we can describe the underlying process as follows:

### Process Description

1. **Initialization**:
   - The process always starts with the activity "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

2. **Core Activities**:
   - The activities involved in the process are:
     - "Request Payment"
     - "Payment Handled"
     - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"

3. **Existence Constraints**:
   - Each of the following activities must occur at least once:
     - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"
     - "Request Payment"
     - "Payment Handled"
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"

4. **Exactly 1 Constraint**:
   - Each of the activities must occur exactly once:
     - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"
     - "Request Payment"
     - "Payment Handled"
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"

5. **Responded Existence Constraints**:
   - If "Request Payment" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur.
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must also occur, and vice versa.
   - If "Payment Handled" occurs, then "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must also occur.

6. **Precedence Constraints**:
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must also occur in the past.
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur in the past.
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Request Payment" must also occur in the past.
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur in the past.
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Request Payment" must also occur in the past.
   - If "Request Payment" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur in the past.

7. **Response Constraints**:
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur in the future.
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must also occur in the future.
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Request Payment" must also occur in the future.
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur in the future.
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Request Payment" must also occur in the future.
   - If "Request Payment" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur in the future.

8. **Succession Constraints**:
   - "Request Payment" must be followed by "Payment Handled".
   - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must be preceded by "Request Payment".
   - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must be preceded by "Payment Handled".
   - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must be followed by "Request Payment".
   - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must be followed by "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".
   - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must be followed by "Payment Handled".

9. **Alternate Constraints**:
   - The activities must alternate without repetitions:
     - "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled"
     - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Payment Handled"
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" and "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" and "Request Payment"
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" and "Payment Handled"
     - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Request Payment"

10. **Chain Constraints**:
    - The directly-follows relation must be maintained:
      - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must be followed by "Request Payment".
      - "Request Payment" must be followed by "Payment Handled".

11. **Absence Constraints**:
    - The following activities should not occur:
      - "Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER"
      - "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION"
      - "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION"
      - "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE"
      - "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE"
      - "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR"
      - "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER"
      - "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR"
      - "Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER"
      - "Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER"
      - "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING"

### Summary

The process model describes a workflow where a declaration is initially submitted by an employee. The process involves requesting payment, handling the payment, and finally having the declaration approved by a supervisor. The activities must occur in a specific order and certain activities must always be present, while others are explicitly absent. The constraints ensure that the process follows a structured and consistent flow, with activities alternating and directly following each other as required.
