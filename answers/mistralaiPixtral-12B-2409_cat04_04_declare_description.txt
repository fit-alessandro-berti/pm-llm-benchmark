Based on the constraints provided in your DECLARE declarative process model, we can infer the underlying process flow. Here's a description of the process:

### Process Description

4. **Absence Constraints**:
   - The activities "Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER", "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION", "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION", "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE", "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE", "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR", "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER", "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR", "Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER", "Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER", and "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" should not occur.

5. **Responded Existence Constraints**:

### Summary

The process model describes a workflow where a declaration is submitted by an employee, followed by a series of approvals and payments handled by various entities. The constraints ensure that certain activities must occur in a specific order and that specific activities must co-occur. The process is designed to ensure that each step is completed exactly once and that certain activities are mutually exclusive. The initialization ensures that the process starts with the declaration submission, and the absence constraints ensure that certain activities do not occur.
