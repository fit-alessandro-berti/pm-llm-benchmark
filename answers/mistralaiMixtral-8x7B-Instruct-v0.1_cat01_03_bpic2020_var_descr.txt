 This data describes a multi-step process that an employee must go through in order to submit a declaration and receive payment. The process can be broken down into the following steps:

1. The employee submits a declaration.
2. The declaration can be approved or rejected by various individuals or groups, including the administration, a pre-approver, a budget owner, or a supervisor. If the declaration is rejected, it is returned to the employee, who can then edit and resubmit it.
3. If the declaration is approved, it goes through a final approval process with the supervisor.
4. Once the declaration is fully approved, a payment is requested.
5. The payment is then handled.

The data includes information on the frequency of each process variant (i.e., how often each specific path through the process occurred) and the performance of each variant (i.e., how long it took for each variant to be completed).

It is worth noting that there are a number of process variants that involve the declaration being rejected and returned to the employee for editing and resubmission. These variants have lower performance scores on average, which may indicate that they take longer to complete than variants where the declaration is approved on the first submission.

Overall, the process appears to involve a series of approvals and checks to ensure that the declaration is accurate and that the payment is warranted.
