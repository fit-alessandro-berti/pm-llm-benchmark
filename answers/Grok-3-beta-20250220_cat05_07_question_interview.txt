Here’s a list of targeted, open-ended questions I would ask the interviewee to deepen my conceptual understanding of the property onboarding process. These questions focus on clarifying details, decision-making, roles, timing, and exception handling while keeping the discussion high-level and process-oriented:

1. **Initial Contact and Documentation:**
   - What typically prompts a landlord to reach out to your company initially—do they find you through marketing, referrals, or some other channel?
   - How does the property coordinator determine if a document like an inspection report is “outdated”? Are there specific time thresholds or regulatory standards they follow?
   - What happens if a landlord is unresponsive when you request updated documentation—how do you escalate or resolve that?

2. **Property Manager Assignment:**
   - Can you walk me through how you weigh factors like workload versus geographic specialization when assigning a property manager? Is there a formal scoring system or is it more intuitive?
   - How do you define a “track record” with unique landlord requirements—are there specific metrics or past examples managers are judged by?
   - What happens if no property manager perfectly fits the property’s needs? Do you ever assign someone temporarily or bring in external support?

3. **Landlord-Manager Alignment:**
   - During the introductory meeting, how do you ensure the landlord’s expectations align with your company’s policies—especially if they have unusual requests like custom maintenance splits?
   - Are there common points of disagreement between landlords and property managers at this stage, and how are they typically resolved?
   - How do you document the outcomes of this meeting, and who else in the company needs to be informed about special conditions?

4. **Inspection and Repairs:**
   - How do you prioritize which issues from the inspector’s report need immediate attention versus those that can wait—are there safety or legal red lines involved?
   - Who decides which contractors to hire for repairs—the property manager, the landlord, or someone else—and how is that decision coordinated?
   - What’s the process if a landlord disagrees with the inspector’s findings or refuses to fund certain repairs?

5. **Marketing and Pricing:**
   - How does the digital marketing team determine the final rental price range—do they rely solely on the property manager’s input, or do they pull data from other sources?
   - What kinds of market trends do they look at when updating the pricing models, and how often are these models revisited?
   - How do you balance speed (getting the property listed quickly) with quality (ensuring photos and listings are top-notch)?

6. **Tenant Screening and Leasing:**
   - What criteria are most important when screening tenants—credit score, references, income—and how do you weigh them if an applicant is strong in some areas but weak in others?
   - When multiple tenants apply, how do you decide whether to negotiate terms or prioritize certain applicants—are there guidelines or is it case-by-case?
   - How do you handle situations where a tenant wants to move in quickly but the lease agreement isn’t fully finalized yet?

7. **Quality Checks and Audits:**
   - What are some common issues the compliance officer looks for in the lease agreements, and how do they collaborate with the property manager if changes are needed?
   - How does the financial analyst ensure the rental price supports profitability targets—do they ever push back on the property manager’s decisions?
   - What kinds of errors has the IT department caught in the past when checking online listings or system integration?

8. **Timing and Sequencing:**
   - How long does the onboarding process typically take from the landlord’s first contact to the tenant’s move-in, and where do delays most often occur?
   - Are there stages that can run in parallel—like marketing prep and inspections—or is the process strictly sequential?
   - How do you communicate timelines to the landlord, and what do they usually expect in terms of speed?

9. **Exception Handling:**
   - Can you give an example of a property that required special insurance—how did that change the onboarding process?
   - How do you handle landlords who insist on custom lease clauses that might conflict with your standard policies?
   - What’s the most challenging exception you’ve encountered in onboarding a property, and how did your team adapt?

10. **Communication and Tools:**
    - How do regional offices, property managers, and support teams stay aligned when communication is bouncing between email, CRM, and project tools—any tricks to avoid things slipping through the cracks?
    - Who has the final say if there’s a disagreement between stakeholders—like between a property manager and a compliance officer?
    - How do you keep landlords in the loop throughout the process—do they get regular updates, or only at key milestones?

These questions aim to peel back layers of the process, revealing how decisions are made, how roles interact, and how the company navigates complexity and exceptions—all while keeping the focus on understanding rather than technical implementation.
