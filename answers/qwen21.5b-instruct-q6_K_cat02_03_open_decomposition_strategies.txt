There are several key benefits to applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects, as well as some potential challenges. These include:

Benefits:
1. Improved accuracy: Decomposition enables more detailed insights into processes, which can lead to more accurate modeling and simulation results.
2. Flexibility: Decomposition allows for the identification of different processes that are relevant to a particular project or context.
3. Reduced complexity: Decomposition reduces the complexity of a process model by identifying only the essential aspects of a process.

Challenges:
1. Time-consuming: Deciding how to decompose a large system is time-consuming and can result in multiple, conflicting results.
2. Lack of understanding: Decomposing complex systems often requires deep understanding of the domain of interest, which can be challenging if there are significant gaps or conflicts among stakeholders with different views on the project objectives.
3. Resistance to change: Some individuals may resist changes or modifications to existing processes, making it more difficult to implement and refine decomposition strategies effectively.

These challenges can be mitigated by thorough planning and coordination between multiple parties involved in process mining projects, as well as the development of iterative approaches that adapt to changing stakeholder perspectives over time.
