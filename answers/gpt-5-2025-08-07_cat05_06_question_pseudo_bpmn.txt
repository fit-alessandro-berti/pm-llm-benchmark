1) What hypotheses from the market research directly drive the design choices in the prototype, and how are those hypotheses validated or killed early to avoid costly downstream rework?

2) How was the decision to geographically diversify components (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, USA) balanced against risks like geopolitics, export controls, and natural disasters, and what are the contingency triggers for rapid re-sourcing?

3) Where is the supply chain’s decoupling point, and could postponement (late-stage customization) reduce forecast error amplification and inventory carrying costs?

4) What criteria determine when to parallelize component procurement versus sequencing it, and how do we minimize idle time when one critical component becomes the pacing constraint?

5) How do we quantify and compare the total landed cost and time of air freight versus ocean freight, including carbon cost, service-level impacts, and risk of demand obsolescence?

6) What is the governance model and cadence (e.g., S&OP/IBP) for reconciling market forecasts with supplier capacity, and how are conflicting priorities (margin, service, cash) escalated and resolved?

7) How is the quality gate tuned to balance false fails (scrap/rework) versus false passes (returns/brand damage), and what real-time SPC/analytics could move us from inspection to process capability?

8) What are the single points of failure across suppliers, logistics lanes, and the Malaysia assembly plant, and what pre-negotiated options (dual-sourcing, capacity reservations, interchangeable components) exist for each?

9) How is the 24/7 assembly operation’s OEE tracked and improved, and are preventive maintenance and changeover strategies synchronized with inbound component variability?

10) What decision rules determine dynamic reallocation of finished goods among regional DCs to prevent stockouts and markdowns, and how fast can those rebalancing moves be executed?

11) How do we ensure end-to-end visibility (control tower, EDI/API, IoT) from suppliers to last mile, and what alerts/thresholds trigger intervention before service-level KPIs are breached?

12) What customs and compliance risks (export controls, product safety, data privacy, forced-labor, battery transport) are proactively assessed, and how are country-specific regulatory changes monitored and actioned?

13) How are contracts and incentives structured with key partners (suppliers, logistics providers, contract manufacturers) to align on resilience, quality, sustainability, and responsiveness rather than just unit cost?

14) What is the risk-adjusted safety stock policy at each echelon (components, WIP, finished goods), and how are multi-echelon inventory optimization and demand variability incorporated?

15) How do market events (promotions, competitor launches, macro shocks) feed demand-shaping decisions (pricing, channel allocation, product mix), and how is cannibalization measured?

16) What metrics form the KPI tree (e.g., OTIF, FPY, NPS/returns, gross margin, cash-to-cash, DIO, TIR, CO2e per unit), and how are trade-offs visualized to inform executive decisions?

17) How is stakeholder communication orchestrated during disruptions—who gets what information, at what frequency, through which channels—and how are decisions documented for post-mortems?

18) What cyber and IP protection controls exist across the ecosystem (design files, firmware, supplier portals), and how do we mitigate risks of counterfeit components or gray-market diversion?

19) How are reverse logistics, repair, and end-of-life recycling integrated to recover value, meet ESG goals, and inform design-for-repairability decisions for the next product cycle?

20) What scenarios are regularly stress-tested (e.g., semiconductor shortage, port closures, currency swings), and what pre-approved playbooks and budgeted “optionality” enable rapid pivot without ad-hoc firefighting?
