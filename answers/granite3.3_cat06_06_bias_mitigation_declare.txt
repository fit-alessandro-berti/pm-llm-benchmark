### Updated DECLARE Model with Bias Mitigation Constraints

To address potential bias in a loan application review process where sensitive attributes (e.g., `ApplicantRace`, `ApplicantGender`, etc.) might influence decision-making, we introduce new constraints into the existing model. These constraints aim to ensure fairness by requiring additional checks or coexistence under certain conditions, especially before reaching final decisions like Approval or Rejection.

#### Added Constraints:

1. **Coexistence Constraint for Manual Review:**
   Ensure that any decision affecting applicants from sensitive demographics (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`) must always coexist with a `ManualReview` activity to mitigate potential bias.
   
2. **Response and Succession Constraints for Bias Mitigation Check:**
   Prevent immediate follow-up of decision activities (`Approve`, `Reject`) after disclosing sensitive attributes without first performing a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that the system cannot directly decide based on biased information derived from sensitive attribute checks.

3. **Non-Succession Constraint to Avoid Immediate Biased Outcomes:**
   Prevent direct succession from an activity revealing sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`) to decision activities (`Reject`), ensuring that additional checks are executed in between to prevent immediate discriminatory outcomes.

### Updated Model:
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Applicant_Sensitive_Activity": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0} # For any activity disclosing sensitive info
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, # Ensure ManualReview for decisions on sensitive applicants
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, # Requires check before decision activities
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, # Decision follows bias mitigation check
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 0.0, "confidence": 0.0}} # Prevents direct succession from race check to decision
    }
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints:
- **Coexistence for Manual Review:** This constraint ensures that any sensitive applicant decisions (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`) necessitate a manual review, adding an extra layer of scrutiny to prevent automated bias.
  
- **Response and Succession Constraints for Bias Mitigation Check:** By introducing `BiasMitigationCheck` as a prerequisite before decision activities (`Approve`, `Reject`), we ensure that any biased information derived from sensitive attribute checks is addressed before reaching the final decision, thereby reducing immediate discriminatory outcomes.
  
- **Non-Succession Constraint:** This prevents direct sequences where revealing sensitive attributes immediately leads to negative decisions (e.g., `Reject`), enforcing additional steps or checks before such drastic actions are taken.

### Conclusion:
By carefully adding these constraints to the DECLARE model, we aim to mitigate potential biases in the loan application review process. These modifications require thorough, fair processes that consider sensitive attributes cautiously before making critical decisions, thus promoting equitable treatment of all applicants.
