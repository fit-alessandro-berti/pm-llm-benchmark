To address this task, you will need to construct a Petri net that accurately represents the described insurance claim management process with the specified possible loops and transitions. Below is a Python code snippet that constructs an accepting Petri net for this scenario.

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet("Insurance Claim Management")

# Define places
start = PetriNet.Place("Start")
claim_registered = PetriNet.Place("Claim Registered")
document_verified = PetriNet.Place("Document Verified")
fraud_checked = PetriNet.Place("Fraud Checked")
in_depth = PetriNet.Place("In-depth Investigation")
adjustment_assessed = PetriNet.Place("Claim Assessed")
approval_status = PetriNet.Place("Approved by Manager")
payment_made = PetriNet.Place("Claim Paid")
customer_notified = PetriNet.Place("Customer Notified")
claim_rounded_off = PetriNet.Place("Claim Rounded Off")
claim_final = PetriNet.Place("Final State")

# Define transitions
initial_claim = PetriNet.Transition("Initial Claim Started")
log_claim = PetriNet.Transition("Claim Registered")
verify_document = PetriNet.Transition("Document Verified")
check_fraud = PetriNet.Transition("Fraud Checked")
investigation = PetriNet.Transition("In-depth Investigation")
assess_claim = PetriNet.Transition("Claim Assessed")
approval_handler = PetriNet.Transition("Approved by Manager")
process_notified = PetriNet.Transition("Process Notification")
process_closured = PetriNet.Transition("Process Closed")

# Add places to the Petri net
net.places.add(start)
net.places.add(claim_registered)
net.places.add(document_verified)
net.places.add(fraud_checked)
net.places.add(in_depth)
net.places.add(adjustment_assessed)
net.places.add(approval_status)
net.places.add(payment_made)
net.places.add(customer_notified)
net.places.add(claim_rounded_off)
net.places.add(claim_final)

# Add transitions to the Petri net
net.transitions.add(initial_claim)
net.transitions.add(log_claim)
net.transitions.add(verify_document)
net.transitions.add(check_fraud)
net.transitions.add(investigation)
net.transitions.add(assess_claim)
net.transitions.add(approval_handler)
net.transitions.add(process_noted)
net.transitions.add(process_closed)

# Connect the places and transitions into a Petri net with arcs
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start, claim_registered, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_registered, document_verified, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verified, verification_document, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verified, check_fraud, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(check_fraud, in_depth, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_checked, fraud_checked, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(in_depth, investigation, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(investigation, in_depth, net) # loop for In-depth Investigation
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(investigation, document_verified, net) # loop back after Investigation
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(adjustment_assessed, approval_handler, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval_handler, approval_handler, net) # loop for Manager approval
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval_handler, claim_rounded_off, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_rounded_off, process_noted, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_rounded_off, process_closed, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(process_noted, payment_made, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(process_closed, claim_final, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(process_noted, claim_rounded_off, net) # loop for Notification - Returning to next unfulfilled place
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(process_closed, claim_final, net) # loop for Closure - Final place

# Define the markings
im = Marking()
im[start] = 1  # Start place has 1 token (new claim arrives)

fm = Marking()
fm[claim_final] = 1  # Final mark represents a claim that has been closed

# Extra places for handling loops in the Petri net
verification_document = PetriNet.Place("Verification Document")
re_verification_doc = PetriNet.Place("Re-verification Document")

# Update the Petri net with loops (re-verification and investigation loops)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verified, verification_document, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(verification_document, re_verification_doc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(re_verification_doc, document_verified, net)  # Loop for document re-submission
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(in_depth, in_depth, net)  # Loop for In-depth Investigation
net.places.add(re_verification_doc)
net.places.add(investigation)

# Remove the extra places as they are now part of the loops
net.places.remove(re_verification_doc)
net.places.remove(investigation)

# Now the Petri net is constructed, however to actually simulate and check if it's accepting, we would also need an execution model and a checking mechanism to verify the acceptance via runs with our initial and final markings. This is usually done with PM4Py or similar tools that support Petri net analysis.
```

Please note that in a real Petri net implementation, it's essential to maintain a correct sequence of places and transitions, as well as prevent the use of places as loop arcs that aren't part of the main body of the Petri net (i.e., loop arcs should link back to an existing part of the net). In this approximation, I purposely added loop arcs where it makes sense in the context (like re-verification and in-depth investigations that may occur multiple times). Also, note that the number of potential loop iterations for DF and II parts aren't coded explicitly but in practice, it’s understood that these places can loop until completion. The sample here lacks the mechanisms usually provided by Petri net simulation software for checking acceptance – we are assuming this condition when constructing the net. If you want to check for acceptance, you should simulate the runs on this Petri net and confirm that the reaching final state is dependent on the initial marking, which in this case, is singular due to the described lifecycle of an insurance claim.
