Below is a sample integrated event log in Markdown format. The table is structured with one row per event, and events are listed per order (case) in chronological order. We’ve included resource names, where available, using the provided resources table. Key assumptions made:

- **Case ID**: Based on the `order_id`.
- **Activity Names**: Chosen logically from provided tables:
  - "Order Created" from Orders
  - "Item Picked" from Order Lines (one event per item)
  - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from Delivery
  - "Invoice Issued" from Invoice
  - "Payment Received" from Payments
- **Timestamps**: Taken directly from the respective event tables.
- **Resources**: Mapped from IDs where possible (e.g., `SP-001` → Alice Brown). If no direct person was specified (e.g., payment events), "N/A" is used.
- **Other Attributes**: Relevant attributes included (e.g., customer, invoice_amount, payment_method).

If data appeared ambiguous, we included all discovered events. The chronological flow follows timestamps strictly.
