**Explanation of Added Constraints:**

- **Coexistence (Approve_Minority, Reject_Minority with ManualReview):**  
  If a decision specifically affecting a minority applicant occurs (e.g., `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), a `ManualReview` must also appear in the process. This ensures that decisions about sensitive demographics are not automated without human oversight, reducing the risk of biased automated decision-making.

- **Response (CheckApplicantRace → BiasMitigationCheck):**  
  After checking sensitive applicant information (like race) via `CheckApplicantRace`, the process must subsequently include a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that any sensitive attribute considered triggers a fairness check, preventing immediate, potentially biased decisions.

- **Precedence (BiasMitigationCheck before Approve/Reject):**  
  The `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede any final decision (`Approve`, `Reject`). This enforces a mandatory fairness examination step before concluding the process, helping to counteract any unconscious bias that might influence the final outcome.

- **Non-succession (CheckApplicantRace not immediately followed by Approve/Reject):**  
  The process cannot move directly from revealing sensitive demographic information (`CheckApplicantRace`) to a final decision (`Approve` or `Reject`) without intervening bias mitigation steps. This prevents “snap judgments” that might be biased and ensures a more considered, unbiased decision-making process.

Collectively, these constraints ensure that sensitive attributes, once observed, do not immediately and disproportionately influence the final decision. They introduce mandatory fairness checks and human reviews, thereby reducing the potential for bias in the loan application process.
