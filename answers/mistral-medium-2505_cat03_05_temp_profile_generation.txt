Here’s a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process, with estimated average times and standard deviations for various activity pairs. The values are based on reasonable assumptions about the process flow and typical delays in supply chain operations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600),          # 1 day avg, 1 hour std (supplier selection to order placement)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),        # 7 days avg, 1 day std (order placement to receiving components)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 3600),          # 4 hours avg, 1 hour std (receiving to inspection)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (21600, 7200),          # 6 hours avg, 2 hours std (inspection to assembly)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (10800, 3600),          # 3 hours avg, 1 hour std (assembly to testing)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),           # 2 hours avg, 30 mins std (testing to packaging)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800),           # 1 hour avg, 30 mins std (packaging to storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),        # 2 days avg, 12 hours std (storage to distribution)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),      # 30 days avg, 7 days std (distribution to after-sales)

    # Non-directly connected but eventually following activities
    ('SS', 'RC'): (792000, 86400),        # 9 days avg, 1 day std (supplier selection to receiving components)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (806400, 86400),        # 9.4 days avg, 1 day std (supplier selection to inspection)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (619200, 86400),        # 7.4 days avg, 1 day std (order placement to inspection)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (640800, 86400),        # 7.4 + 6 hours = ~7.7 days avg
    ('RC', 'PT'): (32400, 10800),         # 9 hours avg, 3 hours std (receiving to testing)
    ('RC', 'PK'): (43200, 14400),         # 12 hours avg, 4 hours std (receiving to packaging)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (18000, 7200),          # 5 hours avg, 2 hours std (inspection to testing)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (28800, 10800),         # 8 hours avg, 3 hours std (inspection to packaging)
    ('CA', 'PK'): (18000, 5400),          # 5 hours avg, 1.5 hours std (assembly to packaging)
    ('PT', 'WS'): (10800, 3600),          # 3 hours avg, 1 hour std (testing to storage)
    ('PK', 'DT'): (176400, 43200),        # 2 days avg, 12 hours std (packaging to distribution)
    ('WS', 'AS'): (2678400, 604800),      # 31 days avg, 7 days std (storage to after-sales)

    # Long-range dependencies
    ('SS', 'DT'): (2736000, 604800),      # 31.5 days avg, 7 days std (supplier selection to distribution)
    ('OP', 'AS'): (3214800, 604800),      # 37 days avg, 7 days std (order placement to after-sales)
    ('RC', 'AS'): (2678400, 604800),      # 31 days avg, 7 days std (receiving to after-sales)
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Directly connected activities**: These pairs represent consecutive steps in the process (e.g., `SS`  `OP`). The average times and standard deviations are based on typical delays for each step.
2. **Non-directly connected activities**: These pairs account for cumulative delays between activities that are not immediate neighbors (e.g., `SS`  `RC`). The averages are sums of intermediate steps, and standard deviations are propagated accordingly.
3. **Long-range dependencies**: These pairs span large portions of the process (e.g., `SS`  `DT`) and include cumulative delays and variability.

The values are illustrative and can be adjusted based on real-world data or domain-specific constraints. The standard deviations are chosen to reflect reasonable variability in supply chain operations.
