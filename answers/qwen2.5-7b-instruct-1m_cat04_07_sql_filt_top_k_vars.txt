### Explanation:

1. **Extracting the Ordered Sequence:**  
   We start by ordering the events for each `case_id` by their `timestamp` to get the sequence of activities. This is done using `ROW_NUMBER()`.

2. **Constructing the Activity Sequence per Case:**  
   By aggregating the activities and timestamps for each `case_id` we create a string that represents the activity sequence. This string is unique to each sequence of activities within a case.

3. **Counting and Ranking Variants by Frequency:**  
   We count the number of cases that follow each activity sequence and rank these sequences according to their frequency. This helps us identify the top K most frequent activity sequences.

4. **Filtering and Selecting Events:**  
   Finally, we filter the original event log to include only those events that belong to the top K activity sequences and return them.

### Notes:
- Replace `K` with the actual number of top variants you are interested in.
- The `STRING_AGG` function is used to concatenate the activities and timestamps into a single string, which represents the activity sequence for each case.
- Depending on your DuckDB version, you might need to convert the `timestamp` to a string using `::TEXT` if the function does not directly support `timestamp` in `STRING_AGG`.
