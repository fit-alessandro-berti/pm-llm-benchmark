    # (Supply Chain Stage, Next Activity)
    ('Supplier Selection (SS)', 'Order Placement (OP)'),  # ~72 hours (varies widely with supplier proximity & complexity)
    ('Supplier Selection (SS)', 'Receive Components (RC)'),  # ~1-4 days depend on shipping (international typical)
    ('Order Placement (OP)', 'Receive Components (RC)'),  # ~1-3 days for order processing and delivery
    ('Receive Components (RC)', 'Quality Inspection (QI)'),
    ('Order Placement (OP)', 'Quality Inspection (QI)'),  # +2-5 days for quality checks (batch-wise processing)
    ('Quality Inspection (QI)', 'Component Assembly (CA)'),
    ('Order Placement (OP)', 'Component Assembly (CA)'),  # +3-7 days for sourcing materials
    ('Component Assembly (CA)', 'Product Testing (PT)'),
    ('Product Testing (PT)', 'Packaging (PK)'),
    ('Quality Inspection (QI)', 'Product Testing (PT)'),  # redundancy in testing (extra checks)
    ('Component Assembly (CA)', 'Warehouse Storage (WS)'),  # 1-3 days (storage lead time)
    ('Product Testing (PT)', 'Warehouse Storage (WS)'),  # testing + storage (if delayed), ~+1 day
    ('Packaging (PK)', 'Distribution (DT)'),  # ~5-10 days (distribution network efficiency)
    ('Distribution (DT)', 'Warehouse Storage (WS)'),  # temporary storage before 'final' delivery, ~1-2 days
    ('After-Sales Support (AS)', 'Distribution (DT)'),  # Support may precede next cycle (if returns handled separately), ~0-24 hours (edge case)

    # Some multi-step dependencies (e.g., testing might take several executions)
    ('Component Assembly (CA)', 'Product Testing (PT)'),  # could span multiple batches/tests, effectively longer time horizon
    ('Receive Components (RC)', 'Quality Inspection (QI)'),  # waits for ordered batch to arrive
    ('Warehouse Storage (WS)', 'Distribution (DT)'),  # extended storage can delay ships by several days
    ('Quality Inspection (QI)', 'Receive Components (RC)'),  # rare but possible re-inspection after storage
    ('After-Sales Support (AS)', 'Packaging (PK)'),  # unlikely, but e.g., returns cause re-packaging, ~variable but often 0-5 days delay
    ('Supplier Selection (SS)', 'After-Sales Support (AS)'),  # IF as-built high repairs/returns lead to longer-lived product life, ~variable, but generally not linked directly in execution timeline
    ('Product Testing (PT)', 'Supplier Selection (SS)'),  # Unlikely, but e.g., refactory approach, extremely speculative, ~variable month or more
}

# Explanation of complexity inclusion:

# - Multi-step activity pairs:
#   - CA -> PT: testing can require multiple execution cycles (batch tests), effectively smoothing the temporal profile over multiple processes.
#   - RS -> AS: long-tail post-sales support, rare but modeled for robustness.

# - Lead & buffering activities:
#   - RS -> RC: accounts for shipping delays.
#   - Receiving often buffers procurement uncertainties.

# - Redundant & overlapping controls:
#   - QI after both RC and before CI: representations of tighter quality gates.
#   - Testing redundancy: extra layers to ensure reliability despite variability in components.

# - Edge cases & indirect dependencies:
#   - AS -> PK: captures delayed support affecting logistics.
#   - AS -> DT: indirect handling of returns in distribution planning.
#   - Backwards dependencies (rare) like AS -> RS or PT -> SS are intentional for resilience modeling.
