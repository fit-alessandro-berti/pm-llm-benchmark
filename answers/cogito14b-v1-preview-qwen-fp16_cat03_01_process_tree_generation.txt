This is a complex scenario that involves multiple sequential, parallel, exclusive choice paths as well as loops. Let me break down the process flow into smaller parts and model them step by step.

1. The initial sequence is straightforward: Arrival -> Registration -> Intake Assessment

2. Then comes another sequence for triage:
   - Triage Interview -> Triage Classification

3. After that, there's an exclusive choice (XOR) between Comprehensive ECG and Full Blood Panel tests.

4. After the diagnostic test, we hit a loop where if results are abnormal, we have another sequence: Specialist Consultation followed by either Targeted Medication or Specialized Physical Therapy (exclusive choice), then Re-Diagnostic Test (which itself has an exclusive choice between Follow-up ECG and Follow-up Blood Analysis).

5. After the abnormal result handling loop ends (when normal results occur), two activities are done in parallel: Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling.

6. Then comes a sequence of Administrative steps: Follow-up Appointment Scheduling followed by Detailed Discharge Instructions.

7. Finally, at the end, three administrative tasks happen in true concurrency: Billing, Insurance Claims Processing, and Medical Records Finalization.

Let me start building this using the operators -> (sequence), X (exclusive choice), + (parallel execution), and * (loop).
