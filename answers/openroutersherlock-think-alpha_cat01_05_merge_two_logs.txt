### Merged Event Log

The merged log is presented below in **chronological order** based on a **primary timestamp** (defined as the *earliest* timestamp from either log for merged events, or the single log's timestamp otherwise). This ensures accurate sequencing while respecting Log A's primary timeline where possible.

Events use a **unified format**:
- **Primary Timestamp**: Chosen as described above.
- **Event Type**: Normalized to Log A's naming convention where matched (e.g., "OrderReceived"  "Order Received"); otherwise, kept as-is.
- **Order ID**: Consistent across both.
- **User ID**, **Resource ID**, **Notes**: Taken from Log B where available; blank ("-") if only from Log A.
- **Other Timestamps**: Includes timestamp from the other log if merged.
- **Source**: "A", "B", or "A+B" (merged).

### Reasoning & Decisions

1. **Matching Criteria**:
   - All events share `Order#1234`, so matching focused on **timestamp proximity** (tolerance: ~5 seconds max, as diffs were small and no better alternatives; guideline example was <2s but extended slightly for semantic fit) and **semantic similarity in event names** (e.g., "OrderReceived"  "Order Received", "PaymentCheck"  "Payment Processed").
   - No events from other orders, so all candidates were viable.
   - Confidence threshold: High for direct name/timing pairs; only merged if no ambiguity.

2. **Specific Matches & Merges** (4 merged events):
   | Log A Event | Log B Event | Timestamp Diff | Reason for Match | Resolution |
   |-------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
   | 10:00:00 Order Received | 09:59:58 OrderReceived | 2s (B earlier) | Identical semantics; minor offset likely due to system receive delays. | Merged: Primary TS = min(09:59:58). Event name from A. All B attrs included. |
   | 10:01:30 Order Validated | 10:01:29 OrderValidation | 1s (B earlier) | Near-identical names/timing. | Merged: Primary TS = min(10:01:29). Event name from A. |
   | 10:02:00 Payment Processed | 10:02:05 PaymentCheck | 5s (B later) | Closest temporal match; names semantically related (payment step). No other nearby events. | Merged: Primary TS = min(10:02:00). Event name from A. Notes explain B's delay. |
   | 10:05:00 Item Shipped | 10:05:02 Shipping | 2s (B later) | Clear shipping semantics. | Merged: Primary TS = min(10:05:00). Event name from A. |

3. **Non-Matched Events** (2 events, included as-is):
   - **Quality Check** (B at 10:03:00): No close match in A (next A event at 10:05:00, different semantics). Inserted chronologically between payment and shipping.
   - **Item Delivered** (A at 10:20:00): No B equivalent (B ends at shipping). Included with A-only fields blank.

4. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - **Timestamps**: Used *earliest* TS as primary for merges (accounts for Log A's "receive" delay and Log B's precision). Included other TS for transparency. Sorted strictly by primary TS  no overlaps.
   - **Event Names**: Prioritized Log A (primary) for normalization, but preserved uniqueness for non-matches.
   - **Attributes**: Fully enriched with B's richer data (user_id, etc.); no overwrites needed as no conflicts (e.g., no differing user_ids).
   - **No Unconfident Matches**: All decisions >90% confidence; no forced pairs.

5. **Overall**:
   - Total events: 6 (5 from A + 5 from B  4 merged + 2 unique).
   - Chronology preserved; Log B's early "OrderReceived" correctly placed first.
   - Handles requirements: Enriched attrs, Log A as primary timeline anchor, tolerance for offsets, all events included.
