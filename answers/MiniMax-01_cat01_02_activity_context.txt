### 4. **Justification of Naming Choices**

1. **"Initial Document Verification" vs. "Re-verify Documents":**
   - **Contextual Clues:** The first occurrence of "Verify Documents" is typically the initial step in the process, while the second occurrence happens after additional documents are submitted or adjustments are made. Renaming them clarifies the sequence and purpose of each verification step.

2. **"Request Missing Documents" vs. "Follow-up Call":**
   - **Contextual Clues:** The first "Call Customer" is usually to request missing information or documents, whereas the second "Call Customer" is a follow-up to confirm adjustments or provide updates. This distinction helps in understanding the purpose of each call.

3. **"Initial Account Adjustment" vs. "Re-adjust Account":**
   - **Contextual Clues:** The first "Adjust Account" is often the primary adjustment based on initial customer interaction, while the second "Adjust Account" is a subsequent adjustment after re-verification or further clarification. This renaming highlights the sequence and necessity of each adjustment.

By renaming the activities with these contextual considerations, the event log becomes more transparent and easier to interpret, facilitating better process analysis and decision-making.
