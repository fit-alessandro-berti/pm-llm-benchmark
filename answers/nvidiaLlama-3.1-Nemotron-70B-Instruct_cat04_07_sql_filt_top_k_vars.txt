**Solving the Benchmark with DuckDB SQL**
=====================================================

**Step 1: Extract Ordered Sequence of Activities per Case**
-----------------------------------------------------------

First, we'll construct a query to extract the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id`. We use the `ARRAY_AGG` function with `ORDER BY` to achieve this.

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
  FROM 
    event_log
  GROUP BY 
    case_id
)
```

**Step 2: Group Cases by Activity Sequence and Count**
--------------------------------------------------------

Next, we group the cases by their activity sequences and count the occurrences of each sequence (i.e., each process variant).

```sql
, variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS variant_count
  FROM 
    case_sequences
  GROUP BY 
    activity_sequence
)
```

**Step 3: Identify Top K Variants**
-------------------------------------

Now, we determine the top K variants based on their frequency. This step uses a `LIMIT` clause with an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the variants by their count in descending order.

```sql
, top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence
  FROM 
    variant_counts
  ORDER BY 
    variant_count DESC
  LIMIT K -- Replace K with your desired number of top variants
)
```

**Step 4: Return Events for Top K Variants**
---------------------------------------------

Finally, we filter the original `event_log` to include only events from cases whose activity sequences match the top K variants.

```sql
SELECT 
  el.*
FROM 
  event_log el
  JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
  JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cs.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
```

**Complete Query**
-------------------

Combining all steps into a single executable query, with `K` set to 3 as an example:

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
  FROM 
    event_log
  GROUP BY 
    case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS variant_count
  FROM 
    case_sequences
  GROUP BY 
    activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_sequence
  FROM 
    variant_counts
  ORDER BY 
    variant_count DESC
  LIMIT 3 -- Example: Showing top 3 variants; replace with desired K
)
SELECT 
  el.*
FROM 
  event_log el
  JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
  JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cs.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
```

**Notes:**

- **Replacing K:** In the `LIMIT` clause of the `top_k_variants` CTE, replace `3` with your desired value for `K`.
- **Assumptions:** This solution assumes that the `event_log` table exists in the DuckDB instance with the specified columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) and that data types are compatible with the operations used (e.g., `timestamp` is of a datetime-compatible type).
- **Performance:** For large datasets, indexing `case_id` and `timestamp` might significantly improve query performance. DuckDB's capabilities regarding indexing should be consulted for implementation details.
