#### 4. Justification for Naming Choices

- **Initial Document Verification vs. Re-Verify Documents**:
  - The first occurrence of "Verify Documents" is the initial check of the documents, hence renamed to "Initial Document Verification."
  - Subsequent occurrences involve re-verification after additional information or adjustments, hence renamed to "Re-Verify Documents."

- **Initial Customer Call vs. Follow-Up Customer Call**:
  - The first call is made to request missing documents or clarify issues, hence renamed to "Initial Customer Call."
  - Subsequent calls are follow-ups to confirm adjustments or provide updates, hence renamed to "Follow-Up Customer Call."

- **Adjust Account Details**:
  - This activity is performed once per case to adjust account details based on interactions or discovered discrepancies, hence the name remains "Adjust Account Details" but is clarified to reflect its role in the process.

These renamings ensure that the activities are clearly differentiated based on their context and role within the process flow, making the event log more understandable and useful for analysis.
