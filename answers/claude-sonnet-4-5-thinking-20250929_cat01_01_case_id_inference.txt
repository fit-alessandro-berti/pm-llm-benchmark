# Case Grouping Analysis

Based on the event attributes (patient demographics, timestamps, activity sequences, and clinical logic), I've identified **three distinct cases**:

---

## **Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER - Leg Fracture)**

| Event | Timestamp | Activity | Resource | Department | Additional Info |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 08:05:13 | Register patient | Admin Clerk | ER | insurance=private |
| 4 | 08:10:50 | Initial triage | Nurse Joy | ER | triage_code=3 |
| 7 | 08:15:42 | X-ray imaging | Radiology Tech | Radiology | body_part=left_leg |
| 12 | 08:23:10 | Doctor consultation | Dr. Lee | ER | diagnosis=hairline_fracture |
| 15 | 08:30:05 | Patient discharged | Ward Clerk | ER | followup=outpatient_clinic |

**Clinical pathway:** ER visit  Triage  Imaging  Diagnosis  Discharge (~25 minutes)

## **Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER - Infection)**

| Event | Timestamp | Activity | Resource | Department | Additional Info |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 2 | 08:07:02 | Register patient | Admin Clerk | ER | insurance=public |
| 5 | 08:12:29 | Initial triage | Nurse Mark | ER | triage_code=2 |
| 8 | 08:16:10 | Lab test requested | Dr. Smith | ER | test_type=blood_panel |
| 10 | 08:20:27 | Lab test completed | Lab Technician | Laboratory | results=normal_levels |
| 11 | 08:22:54 | Doctor consultation | Dr. Smith | ER | diagnosis=minor_infection |
| 14 | 08:27:00 | Prescription created | Dr. Smith | ER | medication=antibiotics |
| 17 | 08:35:29 | Patient discharged | Ward Clerk | ER | followup=pharmacy_pickup |

**Clinical pathway:** ER visit  Triage (higher priority)  Lab work  Diagnosis  Prescription  Discharge (~28 minutes)

---

## **Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Scheduled Surgery)**

| Event | Timestamp | Activity | Resource | Department | Additional Info |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 3 | 08:07:15 | Register patient | Admin Clerk | Surgery | insurance=private |
| 6 | 08:13:00 | Doctor consultation | Dr. Lee | Surgery | reason=scheduled_knee_surgery |
| 9 | 08:16:45 | Surgery preparation | Surgical Nurse | Surgery | prep_type=general_anesthesia |
| 13 | 08:25:19 | Surgery performed | Dr. Lee | Surgery | procedure=arthroscopy |
| 16 | 08:31:37 | Recovery room | Recovery Nurse | Surgery | condition=stable |
| 18 | 08:40:13 | Patient discharged | Ward Clerk | Surgery | followup=physiotherapy_sessions |

**Clinical pathway:** Scheduled admission  Pre-op consultation  Preparation  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge (~33 minutes)

## **Key Distinguishing Factors:**

1. **Patient demographics** (age/gender combinations) remain consistent within each case
2. **Department consistency** (Cases 1 & 2 in ER; Case 3 in Surgery)
3. **Logical activity sequences** follow standard clinical workflows
4. **Timestamp progression** shows chronological order within each case
5. **Clinical coherence** (e.g., X-ray  fracture diagnosis; lab test  infection diagnosis; surgery prep  surgery  recovery)
