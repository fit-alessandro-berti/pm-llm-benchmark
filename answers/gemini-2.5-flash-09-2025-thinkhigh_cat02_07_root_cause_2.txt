## 1. Identification of Performance Issues (Case Duration Analysis)

The duration for each case is calculated from the time of `Submit Claim` (first entry) to `Close Claim` (last entry).

| Case ID | Start Timestamp | End Timestamp | Total Duration | Attribute Focus |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **2001**| 2024-04-01 09:00| 2024-04-01 10:30| **1.5 hours** | Low Complexity, Fast |
| **2004**| 2024-04-01 09:20| 2024-04-01 10:45| **1 hour 25 min**| Low Complexity, Fast |
| **2002**| 2024-04-01 09:05| 2024-04-02 11:00| **25 hours 55 min**| Medium Complexity, Slow |
| **2003**| 2024-04-01 09:10| 2024-04-03 09:30| **2 days 20 min**| High Complexity, Slow |
| **2005**| 2024-04-01 09:25| 2024-04-04 14:30| **3 days 5 hours 5 min**| High Complexity, Very Slow |

### Cases with Performance Issues:

The fast cases (2001, 2004) serve as a baseline for efficient processing (under 2 hours). Cases **2002, 2003, and 2005** are taking significantly longer (ranging from 1 day to over 3 days). Case **2005** stands out as the primary performance issue, taking 77 hours.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

We analyze the attributes of the slow cases (2002, 2003, 2005) to determine the correlation with extended lead times.

### A. Complexity Level (Primary Factor)

Complexity shows the strongest correlation with case duration.

| Complexity | Cases | Average Duration | Process Observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Low** | 2001, 2004 | 1.4 hours | No requests for additional documents were needed. |
| **Medium** | 2002 | 26 hours | Required 1 request for documents. |
| **High** | 2003, 2005 | 62 hours (avg) | Required multiple requests for documents (2 for 2003, 3 for 2005). |

**Finding:** The need for the `Request Additional Documents` activity is the main bottleneck. High complexity claims consistently require multiple cycles of documentation gathering, resulting in delays.

### B. Geographic Region

We compare the regions, controlling for complexity where possible.

| Region | Case ID | Complexity | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | 2001 | Low | 1.5 hours |
| **A** | 2003 | High | 48 hours |
| **B** | 2004 | Low | 1.4 hours |
| **B** | 2002 | Medium | 26 hours |
| **B** | 2005 | High | 77 hours |

**Finding:** Region B appears to have a higher latency risk, particularly for complex claims. Case 2005 (Region B, High) is significantly slower (77 hours) than Case 2003 (Region A, High) (48 hours). This suggests that handling high-complexity cases in Region B leads to greater delays.

### C. Resource (Adjusters and Managers)

We look specifically at the resources involved in the bottleneck activities (`Evaluate Claim` and `Request Additional Documents`).

| Case ID | Adjuster | Complexity | Number of Requests | Time between Last Request and Approval |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2003 (Slow) | Adjuster_Mike | High (Region A) | 2 | 23 hours (Approval 2024-04-02 16:00) |
| 2005 (Very Slow)| Adjuster_Lisa | High (Region B) | 3 | 19 hours (Approval 2024-04-04 10:00) |

**Finding:** While both adjusters handle long cases, the performance gap between the fastest high-complexity case (2003, 48 hours) and the slowest (2005, 77 hours) is significant. **Adjuster_Lisa** is associated with the slowest case (2005), which required three separate document requests and suffered the overall longest lead time. The repeated requests suggest either poor initial document scoping or delayed customer response management.

## 3. Proposed Explanations and Mitigation

### Root Cause 1: Claim Complexity and Documentation Cycles

**Explanation:** High-complexity claims inherently require more information, triggering the `Request Additional Documents` loop. This loop forces the process to pause, waiting for customer response and internal review, dramatically increasing the overall cycle time. Case 2005 illustrates this worst-case scenario with three separate requests over three days.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Pre-Evaluation Checklist:** Develop a detailed, complexity-based checklist during the initial `Evaluate Claim` phase. If the claim is High Complexity, require Adjusters to scope *all* likely necessary documents in the first request, reducing the need for repeated cycles.
2.  **Parallel Processing:** Implement a triage system where High Complexity claims are immediately assigned to senior adjusters who can handle the evaluation and documentation request steps concurrently with basic validation steps, instead of strictly sequentially.
3.  **SLA Monitoring:** Enforce strict SLAs for the time spent waiting for customer responses after a document request has been sent, and flag cases that stall in this state.

### Root Cause 2: Regional/Resource Inefficiency (Region B, Adjuster_Lisa)

**Explanation:** While high complexity explains the baseline slowness, the disparity between Region A's high-complexity processing (48 hours) and Region B's (77 hours) points to a regional or resource-specific issue. Adjuster_Lisa handled the two slowest claims in Region B (2002 and 2005), and her handling of 2005 involved multiple request cycles, suggesting potential inefficiency, high workload, or poor quality of initial scoping compared to other resources.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Workload Balancing:** Investigate if Region B or Adjuster_Lisa specifically has a higher volume of claims, leading to resource saturation and subsequent delays in reviewing documentation or submitting new requests.
2.  **Training and Standardisation:** Provide targeted training to Adjuster_Lisa and the Region B team on handling complex claim intake, focusing on comprehensive initial document requests (as opposed to sequential requests).
3.  **Process Handover Review:** Analyze the handover points, specifically the time between the final `Request Additional Documents` and `Approve Claim` (Case 2005 showed a 19-hour gap). This might indicate a backlog at the management approval stage (Manager_Bill in this case) for Region B claims.

### Root Cause 3: Manager Approval Bottleneck (Implied)

**Explanation:** In the slowest high-complexity cases (2003 and 2005), there are significant gaps between the last activity performed by the Adjuster (or the customer submitting the document) and the `Approve Claim` activity. These 19-23 hour gaps suggest a potential bottleneck in the management review/approval queue, particularly for Manager_Bill (who handled the two High Complexity cases).

**Mitigation Strategy:**

1.  **Manager Capacity Review:** Analyze the workload and approval times for Manager_Ann (fast cases) versus Manager_Bill (slow cases). If Manager_Bill is overburdened or less efficient, capacity reallocation or delegation of certain approval tasks may be necessary.
