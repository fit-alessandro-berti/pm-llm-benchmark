    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT :K  -- Replace :K with the desired integer value for K, or use a parameter if supported
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT v.case_id
    FROM variants v
    JOIN top_variants t ON v.variant = t.variant

ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;  -- Optional: to order events chronologically per case in the output
```

This DuckDB SQL query fulfills all requirements:

- It constructs the activity sequence per `case_id` using `string_agg(activity, '>' ORDER BY timestamp)`, ensuring chronological order with '>' as a common separator for process variants.
- It groups by the sequence to count cases per variant.
- It selects the top K variants by frequency using `LIMIT`.
- It filters the original events to include only those from cases belonging to the top K variants.

Note: The parameter `K` is represented as `:K` (you can substitute the actual number, e.g., `LIMIT 5`). The final `ORDER BY` ensures readable output but is optional, as the task does not specify output ordering.
