## Analysis and Activity Renaming

### 1. Identified Recurring Activities

After analyzing the event log, I've identified three activities that appear multiple times within cases with different contextual meanings:

- **Verify Documents** - appears twice in cases C001 and C003
- **Call Customer** - appears twice in case C002 and has different purposes across cases
- **Adjust Account** - appears in C002 and C003 with different contexts

### 2. Contextual Analysis and Renaming Strategy

**Verify Documents:**
- First occurrence: Initial identity verification
- Second occurrence: Re-verification after additional information is provided

**Call Customer:**
- Different purposes: requesting documents, clarifying issues, confirmation calls, or requesting physical presence

**Adjust Account:**
- C002: Corrections based on customer clarification
- C003: Internal corrections due to missing information

```

### 4. Justification of Naming Choices

**Verify Documents:**
- Added "Initial Check" for first occurrences to indicate the standard verification step
- Used "Re-verification" (C001) when checking after additional documents are submitted
- Used "Post-Adjustment" (C003) when verification follows account modifications

**Call Customer:**
- Added specific purposes: "Request Documents," "Clarify Discrepancy," "Confirm Adjustments," and "Request Return"
- Each suffix clearly indicates why the customer is being contacted

**Adjust Account:**
- "Post-Clarification" (C002) indicates adjustments made after customer input
- "Internal Correction" (C003) indicates adjustments made due to system/process issues

**Initiate Request:**
- Added "Branch Walk-in" for C003 to distinguish from web portal submissions

These naming conventions make the process flow clearer and help distinguish between similar activities that serve different purposes in the workflow.
