### Process Description based on Log Skeleton

The process outlined by the declarative rules yields several insights into the workflow governing the described administrative case management. Understanding this process can help in managing not just workflow but also resource allocation and compliance monitoring. Below is a detailed explanation of the outlined process, deduced from the provided declarative constraints.

#### Core Activities and Decision Points

- **Initiation and Submission**: Cases start with an employee submitting declarations for approval via an administration process, which includes possible rejections (`Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`, `Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`).

- **Approval Workflow**: Multiple approval stages are present, involving supervisors, pre-approval, budget owners, and administration. Approvals and rejections happen at various levels (`Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`, `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`).

- **Rejection Handling**: Cases can often result in rejections (`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`). Rejections can often lead to the statement "rejection by missing" (`Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`).

- **Final Approval and Payments**: After a series of approvals, cases can reach final approval by a supervisor (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`), leading up to potential requests for payment (`Request Payment`) and handling of payments (`Payment Handled`).

- **Decision Dependencies**: The workflow involves checks for decisions taken earlier (`Always Before`), ensuring for example, that certain pre-approvals (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`) must be settled before submission (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

- **Preventive Measures**: There are explicit rules preventing certain scenarios (`Never Together`), such as ensuring that the supervisor's approval doesn't coincide with employee rejections or saving attempts by the employee, keeping the process streamlined.

- **Occurrence and Timing**: Some activities occur in a predefined fashion (`Activity Occurrences`) and follow certain events directly (`Directly-Follows Constraints`), offering insights into case volumes and potential bottlenecks.

#### Process Overview

The process could be mapping out an administrative or financial approval process within a regulatory-heavy framework. Each activity adheres to rules that restrict how often they can occur (`Activity Occurrences`) and what activities must precede (`Always Before`) or succeed (`Always After`) them. The frequent use of "rejected by missing" suggests an issue
