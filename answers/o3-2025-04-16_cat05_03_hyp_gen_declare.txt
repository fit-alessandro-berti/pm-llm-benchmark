ANOMALIES FOUND IN THE DECLARE MODEL  

1. Deadstep contradiction  
   • “C” (Close) is mandatory in every trace (existence = 1.0).  
   • “E” (Evaluate) is declared mutually exclusive with “C” (noncoexistence).  
    Result: the evaluation step can never take place, although it is part of the intended process flow.

2. Vacuous (harmlessbutmisleading) constraint  
   • Respondedexistence E  A says: “If E occurs, A must also occur.”  
   • Because E is effectively forbidden by anomaly 1, this rule is always satisfied without ever being tested.  
    Hides the fact that evaluations are missing.

3. Missing causality for the core flow  
   • No rule enforces the sequence R  A  E  P  N  C.  
   • Only one precedence is present (R before C). All other steps can be skipped or permuted.

4. Hidden compliance gap with business policy  
   • The intended policy requires every claim to be evaluated before it is closed.  
   • The model not only omits this requirement, it explicitly forbids it (see anomaly 1).

5. Potential deadlock under future extensions  
   • If someone later adds a rule that obliges “E” to occur, the model becomes unsatisfiable because E and C cannot coexist while C is still mandatory.

POSSIBLE REASONS (HYPOTHESES)

A. Requirement misunderstanding  
   – “Noncoexistence” may have been chosen instead of “precedence” or “response,” mistakenly prohibiting E instead of enforcing E  C.

B. Incremental policy updates  
   – Evaluation might have been temporarily waived (e.g., fasttrack claims), the rule added, but the older “E  A” relation was left untouched.

C. Mining artefacts  
   – If the DECLARE model was mined from noisy event data, sparse or missing evaluation events could have misled the mining algorithm to infer noncoexistence.

D. Technical data loss  
   – Evaluation events might exist in reality but were not logged; the discovery tool therefore generated constraints that forbid them.

E. Throughput pressure  
   – Management could have insisted on closing claims quickly, encouraging a direct R  C path. The contradictory rules reflect competing objectives captured by different stakeholders.

SQLBASED VERIFICATION STRATEGIES

The queries below use the claim_events table and rely on claim_id and timestamp.

1. Claims closed without any Evaluation (should be impossible in the intended process, but allowed by the model)
```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM   claim_events
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0   -- closed
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;  -- never evaluated
```

2. Claims containing both Evaluation and Closing (violates the declared noncoexistence rule)
```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM   claim_events
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0;
```

3. Evaluation performed without a prior Assignment (violates E  A)
```sql
WITH first_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS first_assign,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS first_eval
  FROM   claim_events
  GROUP  BY claim_id)
SELECT claim_id
FROM   first_times
WHERE  first_eval IS NOT NULL              -- there was an evaluation
  AND (first_assign IS NULL                -- but no assignment at all
       OR first_assign > first_eval);      -- or assignment happened after evaluation
```

4. Closing that occurs before Receiving (sanity check for the lone R  C precedence)
```sql
WITH first_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS first_receive,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS first_close
  FROM   claim_events
  GROUP  BY claim_id)
SELECT claim_id
FROM   first_times
WHERE  first_close IS NOT NULL 
  AND  first_receive IS NOT NULL
  AND  first_close < first_receive;
```

5. Frequency of traces with no Evaluation at all (quantifies the business impact)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT claim_id) AS claims_without_eval
FROM   claim_events
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
```

6. Check whether every Evaluation is linked to an adjuster (join to adjusters table)
```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.event_id
FROM   claim_events  ce
LEFT   JOIN adjusters a  ON a.name = ce.resource
WHERE  ce.activity = 'E'
  AND  a.adjuster_id IS NULL;   -- evaluation done by someone not recorded as an adjuster
```

Running these queries will reveal whether the contradictory or missing constraints actually manifest in the live data and to what extent the real process deviates from the intended policy.
