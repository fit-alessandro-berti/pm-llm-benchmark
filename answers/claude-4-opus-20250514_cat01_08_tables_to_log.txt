Based on the provided tables, I'll create a comprehensive event log for process mining. Let me analyze the data and construct the events chronologically for each order.

## Event Log

## Assumptions and Notes:

1. **Case ID**: Used `order_id` as the unique case identifier for each process instance.

2. **Activities Identified**:
   - Order Created (from Orders table)
   - Item Picked (from Order Lines table - one event per item)
   - Order Dispatched (from Delivery table)
   - Order Arrived (from Delivery table)
   - Invoice Issued (from Invoice table)
   - Payment Received (from Payments table)

3. **Resource Mapping**:
   - Sales persons for Order Created events
   - Warehouse staff (pickers) for Item Picked events
   - Carriers for Order Dispatched and Order Arrived events
   - Billing clerks for Invoice Issued events
   - No specific resource for Payment Received (system-generated)

4. **Special Cases**:
   - Order 1002 has two deliveries (split shipment), creating two dispatch and two arrival events
   - Order 1002 has two invoices, likely corresponding to the split delivery
   - Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment records in the provided data (incomplete process)

5. **Additional Attributes**:
   - Included customer type and order priority from the Orders table
   - Added item details for picking events
   - Included invoice amounts and payment methods where applicable
   - Added delivery notes and carrier information

The event log is sorted by Case ID first, then chronologically by timestamp within each case, showing the complete process flow from order creation to payment receipt (where data is available).
