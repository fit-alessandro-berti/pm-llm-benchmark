Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Identify cases with the specific 3-activity sequence in direct succession
2. Among those, find cases where 'Create Order' to 'Confirm Order' takes more than 5 days
3. Exclude all events from those cases from the final result

Here's my approach:
- Use window functions to check for the sequence pattern
- Calculate time differences between consecutive activities
- Filter out the problematic cases

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as event_order,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered_events
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL 5 DAYS
)
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude);
```

This query works by:

1. **ordered_events CTE**: For each event, I use `LEAD()` to look at the next 1 and 2 events in the same case, ordered by timestamp
2. **cases_to_exclude CTE**: I identify cases that have the exact sequence where:
   - Current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   - Next activity is 'Create Order' 
   - Next+1 activity is 'Confirm Order'
   - Time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days
3. **Final SELECT**: Return all events except those from the excluded cases

The key insight is that by using `LEAD()` functions, I ensure the activities are consecutive (no other events in between), and the date arithmetic in DuckDB handles the interval comparison properly.
