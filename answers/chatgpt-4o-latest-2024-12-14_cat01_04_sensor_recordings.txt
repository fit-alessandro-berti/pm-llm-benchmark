### Analysis and Labeling of Manufacturing Activities

By analyzing the provided event log, I identified distinct patterns in sensor readings that correspond to high-level manufacturing activities. The process appears to consist of phases where sensor readings show consistent trends or sharp transitions, indicating different activities being performed on the assembly line. Below is the breakdown of labeled activities with justifications:

---

### **1. Idle (Events 1–3 and 13–15)**  
- **Sensor Pattern:**  
  - **Temperature:** Stable around 20–21°C  
  - **Pressure, Vibration, Flow:** Constantly at 1 bar, 0 Hz, 0 units/s  
  - **Tool Position:** Stationary at 0 mm  
  - **Energy Consumption:** Low (0.4–0.5 kWh)  
- **Justification:**  
  These readings indicate the machine is idle or in a standby state. There’s no material flow, vibration, or significant energy usage, which suggests no active operations are occurring.

### **2. Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)**  
- **Sensor Pattern:**  
  - **Temperature:** Rises from 50°C to 58°C  
  - **Vibration Level:** High (30–38 Hz)  
  - **Material Flow:** Active at 5 units/s  
  - **Tool Position:** Progressively increasing from 5 mm to 10 mm  
  - **Energy Consumption:** Moderate (2.0–3.0 kWh)  
- **Justification:**  
  The increase in temperature, vibration, and tool position suggests a high-energy, high-precision operation, such as cutting. Material flow at 5 units/s further supports this activity, as material is being processed.

### **3. Assembling Parts (Events 7–8)**  
- **Sensor Pattern:**  
  - **Temperature:** Stabilizes around 40°C  
  - **Pressure:** Increases slightly to 2 bar  
  - **Vibration Level:** Drops significantly to 10 Hz  
  - **Material Flow:** Decreases to 2 units/s  
  - **Tool Position:** Fixed at 15 mm  
  - **Energy Consumption:** Moderate and steady (2.0 kWh)  
- **Justification:**  
  The reduction in vibration and material flow, along with stable tool positioning, indicates assembly. The machine is handling parts with reduced motion but consistent energy usage.

### **4. Welding (Event 9)**  
- **Sensor Pattern:**  
  - **Temperature:** Peaks at 80°C  
  - **Pressure:** Stable at 2 bar  
  - **Vibration Level:** High (50 Hz)  
  - **Material Flow:** Stops (0 units/s)  
  - **Tool Position:** Fixed at 15 mm  
  - **Energy Consumption:** High (5.0 kWh)  
- **Justification:**  
  The spike in temperature, high vibration, and energy usage indicate a welding operation. Welding requires intense localized heating and energy, aligning with these observations.

---

### **5. Quality Inspection (Events 10–12)**  
- **Sensor Pattern:**  
  - **Temperature:** Drops to 25–30°C  
  - **Pressure:** Decreases to 1 bar  
  - **Vibration Level:** Low (1–5 Hz)  
  - **Material Flow:** Minimal (0–1 units/s)  
  - **Tool Position:** Fixed at 20 mm  
  - **Energy Consumption:** Low to moderate (1.0–1.6 kWh)  
- **Justification:**  
  The steady readings, low vibration, and minimal material flow indicate inspection or testing. This phase likely involves sensor-based quality checks without active material processing.
