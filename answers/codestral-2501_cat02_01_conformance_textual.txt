To identify which cases in the event log violate the normative process as described, we need to compare each case against the expected sequences outlined in the normative description. Let's analyze each case step by step:

### Case 1
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-05 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-05 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-05 11:00    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-05 12:00    | Package items      |
| 2023-10-05 13:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-05 14:00    | Close order        |

**Violation:** None. This case follows the expected sequence for sufficient inventory: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close.

### Case 2
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-06 10:00    | Package items      |
| 2023-10-06 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order        |

**Violation:** The activity "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."

### Case 3
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-07 10:30    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order        |

**Violation:** The activity "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order." According to the normative process, if the inventory is insufficient, the process should branch to "Cancel order" directly after "Check inventory," without authorizing payment.

### Case 4
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-08 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-08 09:10    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-08 09:20    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-08 09:50    | Close order        |

**Violation:** None. This case follows the expected sequence for insufficient inventory: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.

### Case 5
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-09 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order        |

**Violation:** The activity "Ship order" occurs before "Package items." According to the normative process, "Package items" should occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
- **Case 3:** "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order."
- **Case 5:** "Ship order" occurs before "Package items."

These violations are based on the normative process description, which specifies the order of activities and the conditions under which certain activities should or should not occur.
