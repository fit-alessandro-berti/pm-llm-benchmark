Here’s how I partitioned the 15 timestamped readings into coherent “phases” and assigned each a processstep label.  I’ve also given the key sensorpattern cues that drove each label.  

1. Phase: Machine Idle / Warm-Up (Events 1–3 and 13–15)  
   • Events:  
     - 1 (08:00:00)–3 (08:00:10): T20–21 °C, P=1 bar, vibration=0 Hz, zero flow, tool at 0 mm, low energy (0.4–0.5 kWh)  
     - 13 (08:01:00)–15 (08:01:10): same “rest” signature  
   • Rationale: all sensors at baseline, no material is moving and tool is retracted. This bracket marks pre-start and post-process quiescence.  

2. Phase: Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)  
   • Events: 4 (08:00:15), 5 (08:00:20), 6 (08:00:25)  
   • Sensor signature:  
     – Temperature spikes from 205058 °C  
     – Vibration surges to 30–38 Hz  
     – Material flow steady at 5 units/s (chips being evacuated)  
     – Tool plunges from 510 mm  
     – Energy draw jumps to 2.03.0 kWh  
   • Rationale: simultaneous high heat, high vibration and continuous material flow are classic of a cutting or milling operation removing metal.  

3. Phase: Assembling Parts (Events 7–8)  
   • Events: 7 (08:00:30), 8 (08:00:35)  
   • Sensor signature:  
     – Temp settles at ~40 °C (still warm but cooler than cutting)  
     – Vibration low (10 Hz)  
     – Flow reduced to 2 units/s (small feed of fasteners or adhesive)  
     – Tool position held at 15 mm, energy 2.0 kWh steady  
   • Rationale: moderate, stable conditions with lowlevel flow suggest material being joined rather than removed—consistent with an assembly step.  

4. Phase: Welding (Event 9)  
   • Event: 9 (08:00:40)  
   • Sensor signature:  
     – Temp jumps to 80 °C (highest in the cycle)  
     – Vibration spikes to 50 Hz  
     – Material flow falls to zero (no chips or parts feeding through)  
     – Tool position fixed at 15 mm, energy peaks at 5.0 kWh  
   • Rationale: very high heat and vibration with zero flow is indicative of a welding or brazing operation at a static joint.  

5. Phase: Quality Inspection (Event 10)  
   • Event: 10 (08:00:45)  
   • Sensor signature:  
     – Temp down to 30 °C, vibration near zero (1 Hz), flow=0  
     – Tool stays at 15 mm, energy drops to 1.0 kWh  
   • Rationale: machine is no longer doing heavy work or moving material; very low activity suggests a sensor or probe is examining the weld or assembly in place.  

6. Phase: Packaging (Events 11–12)  
   • Events: 11 (08:00:50), 12 (08:00:55)  
   • Sensor signature:  
     – Temp ~25 °C, vibration low (5 Hz)  
     – Small flow resumes at 1 unit/s (e.g. moving finished parts away)  
     – Tool moves out to 20 mm, energy creeps up to 1.6 kWh  
   • Rationale: slight material flow plus tool motion and moderate energy draw point to removal of parts and transfer—i.e. packaging or partpick for the next station.

By clustering on abrupt rises/drops in temperature, vibration, flow and toolposition, we recover exactly five core manufacturing activities (plus idle), matching the expected process map:
