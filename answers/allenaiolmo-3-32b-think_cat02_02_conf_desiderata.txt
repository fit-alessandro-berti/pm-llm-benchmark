Okay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to analyze each case based on the strict rules and the recommended best practices. 

Starting with Case 1. The events are in order: Application Received, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. That follows the required sequence perfectly. The timing between steps seems okay too, but since the desiderata are just recommendations, unless specified, Case 1 probably doesn't violate any normative rules. However, I should check if any steps are missing or out of order. No, everything is there in the right sequence. So Case 1 is compliant.

Moving on to Case 2. The first issue I notice is that after Application Received at 08:00, the next activity is Risk Assessment at 08:20. But according to the normative rules, Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Here, they did Risk Assessment first without doing the Credit Check. That's a clear violation of the ordering rule. The Credit Check happens later at 08:20, but that's after the Risk Assessment. So that's a problem. 

Then, after the Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30, they proceed to Finalize Documentation at 10:00. But the rules state that if rejected, you shouldn't finalize documentation before closing. So that's another violation. Even though they closed the case after, the Finalize step after rejection is not allowed. 

Additionally, the order after the decision: they did Finalize Documentation before closing, which is only allowed if approved. Since it was rejected, that's a no-no. So Case 2 has two normative violations: wrong order of Credit Check after Risk Assessment, and finalizing docs after rejection.

Now, looking at the desiderata for Case 2. The timing between Application and Credit Check isn't mentioned here because the Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, but the desiderata mainly talk about Credit Check within 24 hours and informing within 48 hours of the decision. Since the Credit Check was done 20 minutes later, that's way under 24 hours, but the main issue is the order. The desiderata violation here might not be present because the timing for Credit Check is okay, but the sequence is wrong. However, the desiderata are about timing and follow-up calls. Since there's no mention of a follow-up call missing here, maybe Case 2 doesn't have desiderata issues except maybe the order, but order is normative. So desiderata-wise, maybe no issues unless the time between steps is considered. Wait, the desiderata for Case 2: the Credit Check was done after the Risk Assessment, but the timing between Application and Credit Check was only 20 minutes, which is within 24 hours. But since the Credit Check wasn't done before Risk Assessment, that's a normative issue, not a desideratum. So for desiderata, perhaps there's nothing here except maybe if the time between decision and informing was too long, but in Case 2, the Loan Decision was at 09:30 and the case was closed at 10:30. Wait, actually, in the table for Case 2, after Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30, they did Finalize Documentation at 10:00 and Close Case at 10:30. The Inform Applicant step is missing? Wait, looking back at the table: 

Wait, let me recheck Case 2's event log:

Case 2 entries:

2       | 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received  
2       | 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment       | *(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)*  
2       | 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check  
2       | 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected)  
2       | 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation| *(Not allowed after rejection)*  
2       | 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case  

Wait, the Inform Applicant step is missing here! The normative rules require that after Loan Decision, you must inform the applicant. In Case 2, after Loan Decision at 09:30, they went straight to Finalize Documentation at 10:00, skipping Inform Applicant. That's another violation. The Inform Applicant is mandatory after the decision. So actually, three normative violations in Case 2:

1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (ordering violation)
2. Missing Inform Applicant step after Loan Decision
3. Finalize Documentation after rejection

That's even worse. I missed the missing Inform step initially. So three normative issues here.

Now, for desiderata in Case 2: The Credit Check was done 20 minutes after application, which is within 24 hours, so that's good. But since the Credit Check was after Risk Assessment, that's a normative issue. The informing step was skipped entirely, which is a normative violation, so not a desideratum. The timing between decision and informing isn't applicable here because they didn't inform. The desiderata about informing within 48 hours of decision isn't met because they didn't inform at all. Wait, but the desiderata are recommendations, so not informing is a desiderata failure? Or is the informing a normative requirement? Let me check the original rules.

Looking back at the normative constraints: "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision." So that's a strict rule. Therefore, skipping Inform Applicant is a normative violation, not just a desideratum. Therefore, Case 2's missing Inform step is a normative violation. So the desiderata for Case 2 would be: maybe the time between Application and Credit Check is okay (within 24h), but since the Credit Check was after Risk Assessment, the timing isn't the issue here. The main desiderata issues would be if any timing recommendations were violated beyond that. Since the Credit Check was done quickly, but out of order, but the desiderata only care about timing if the step is done. Since the Credit Check was done, even if late, but here it was early. Wait, the desiderata says "Credit Check is completed within a short time window after the application is received (e.g., within 24 hours)", which was satisfied (20 minutes). So no desiderata issue there. The informing was skipped, but that's a normative violation. The Follow-up Call is recommended but not done, but since it's optional, that's a desiderata failure. Wait, the desiderata mentions "it is encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call...". So the absence of Follow-up Call is a desiderata failure. But in the event log for Case 2, there's no Follow-up Call noted. So that's a desiderata issue. So for desiderata in Case 2: missing Follow-up Call. However, the main normative issues are the three I listed. 

Wait, but the Follow-up Call is just an encouraged step, not required. So in the desiderata section, Case 2 fails to do the Follow-up Call. But the problem is that the event log doesn't have any Follow-up Call entries. So that's a desiderata violation. But maybe the Follow-up Call is supposed to happen before closing the case? The description says "sometime before closing the case". In Case 2, the case was closed at 10:30, and there's no mention of a Follow-up Call, so that's a desiderata failure. So for desiderata in Case 2: missing Follow-up Call and possibly the time between decision and closing? Wait, the Loan Decision was at 09:30, and the case was closed at 10:30. The desiderata mentions informing within 48 hours of the decision, but since they didn't inform at all, that's a normative failure. The timing between decision and closing isn't a desideratum unless specified. The desiderata specifically mention informing promptly (within 48h of decision) and Follow-up Call before closing. Since they didn't inform, that's a normative issue. The Follow-up Call is missing, so that's a desiderata issue. So for desiderata in Case 2: missing Follow-up Call. 

Moving on to Case 3. Let's check the normative rules first. The sequence starts with Application Received, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. Let's see the order here. 

Case 3's events:

3       | 2024-01-12 09:00    | Application Received  
3       | 2024-01-14 10:00    | Credit Check          | *(Happened more than 24 hours later - just a desideratum violation)*  
3       | 2024-01-14 11:00    | Risk Assessment  
3       | 2024-01-14 12:00    | Loan Decision (Approved)  
3       | 2024-01-16 15:00    | Inform Applicant      | *(Later than recommended 48 hours - again a desideratum violation)*  
3       | 2024-01-17 09:00    | Finalize Documentation  
3       | 2024-01-17 10:00    | Close Case  

The sequence here is correct: Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Decision, Inform, Finalize, Close. So the order is okay. The steps are all present in the right order. However, the timing between Application and Credit Check is 2 days (from Jan 12 to Jan 14 at 10:00), which is more than 24 hours. That's a desiderata issue because the recommendation was to do Credit Check within 24h. Similarly, after the Loan Decision (on Jan 14 12:00), the Inform Applicant happened on Jan 16 at 15:00, which is 3 days later. The desideratum suggested informing within 48 hours (2 days) of the decision. 3 days is over 48 hours, so that's another desiderata violation. 

Additionally, the Follow-up Call is not mentioned in the event log for Case 3, so that's another desiderata failure. The normative rules are all followed here because all steps are in order and none are missing. So normatively, Case 3 is compliant. The issues are only with the desiderata.

Now, for the desiderata in Case 3: three issues: Credit Check delayed beyond 24h, Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48h, and missing Follow-up Call. These are all desiderata violations but not normative.

So summarizing:

Normative Violations:
- Case 2 has three violations:
  1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (ordering)
  2. Missing Inform Applicant after Loan Decision
  3. Finalize Documentation after rejection (since decision was rejected)

Case 1 and 3 have no normative violations.

Desiderata Failures:
- Case 2:
  - Missing Follow-up Call (recommended but not done)
  - Also, the time between Application and Credit Check was okay (20 mins), but since Credit Check was after Risk Assessment, but the timing itself wasn't the issue here. Wait, the desideratum about Credit Check within 24h was met, even though the order was wrong. The desideratum violation for timing in Case 2 would not apply here because the Credit Check was done within 24h of application (08:00 to 09:00 same day). Wait, in Case 2, Application at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00, so that's within 24h. The problem was the order, which is normative. So the desiderata for timing of Credit Check in Case 2 is okay. The desiderata failures in Case 2 are the missing Follow-up Call.

Wait, but in the event log note for Case 2's Credit Check entry, the note says "No prior Credit Check - violates normative", which is correct. The timing for Credit Check is okay (within 24h), so no desiderata issue there. The desiderata issues in Case 2 are only the missing Follow-up Call. 

For Case 3:
- Credit Check was 2 days after application (desideratum violation)
- Inform Applicant was 3 days after decision (desideratum)
- Missing Follow-up Call (desideratum)

So total desiderata issues for Case 3: three points.

Now, for the task:

1. Identify normative violations:

Case 2 has three normative violations as listed.

Case 1 and 3 are okay.

2. Desiderata failures:

Case 2: missing Follow-up Call.

Case 3: delayed Credit Check (>24h), delayed Inform (>48h), missing Follow-up Call.

Additionally, for Case 2, the time between decision and closing isn't a desideratum, but since they skipped Inform, which is normative, but the desiderata about informing within 48h of decision isn't met because they didn't inform at all. However, since informing is a normative step, the desideratum's timing recommendation for informing is only applicable if the step was performed. Since they didn't inform, maybe that's not considered for desiderata? The desideratum says "inform promptly (within 48h of decision)", but if they didn't inform, then that's a normative failure, not a desideratum one. The desiderata would only apply if they did inform but late. So in Case 2, since they didn't inform, it's a normative violation, not a desiderata issue. So the desiderata for informing's timing isn't violated because the step wasn't done. Therefore, the desiderata for Case 2 is only the missing Follow-up Call.

So, to clarify:

Desiderata are recommendations that, if followed, are good, but not required. So for steps that are required (normative), their timing can be part of desiderata. For example, the Credit Check must be done (normative), but doing it within 24h is a desideratum. If you do the Credit Check but after 24h, that's a desiderata failure. If you skip Credit Check entirely, that's a normative violation. 

In Case 3, Credit Check was done but after 24h: desideratum failure. Inform was done but after 48h: desideratum failure. Follow-up Call wasn't done: desideratum failure. So three desiderata issues.

In Case 2, Credit Check was done within 24h (so okay for desiderata), but out of order (normative). Inform wasn't done (normative), so no desiderata there. Follow-up Call missing (desideratum). So only one desideratum issue in Case 2.

Now, for the third part: suggest interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors in line with constraints/recommendations.

For Case 2's normative violations:

- Risk Assessment before Credit Check: Maybe a system error where the Risk Assessment was triggered prematurely? But according to the rules, this is invalid. No justification allowed here since it's a strict rule.

- Missing Inform Applicant: Perhaps the system forgot to log it, but per the rules, it's mandatory. No valid justification.

- Finalize Documentation after rejection: Maybe a clerical error where they thought it was approved? But the decision was clearly rejected. No valid reason.

For the desiderata in Case 2, missing Follow-up Call: Maybe the case was straightforward, and they skipped it, but it's just a recommendation.

For Case 3's delays:

- Credit Check took 2 days: Maybe high volume or backlog, but the recommendation is to do within 24h. No strict rule broken, so it's just suboptimal.

- Inform took 3 days after decision: Perhaps delays in communication, but again, just a recommendation.

- Missing Follow-up Call: Maybe the applicant didn't respond, or it was deemed unnecessary.

So in the answer, I need to list the normative violations clearly for each case, then the desiderata issues, and then possible justifications where applicable.

Now, structuring the answer as per the user's request:

1. Normative Violations:

- Case 2:
  a. Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (violates "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment").
  b. Missing "Inform Applicant" step after Loan Decision (violates "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision").
  c. "Finalize Documentation" performed after a rejection (violates "If rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing").

2. Desiderata Failures:

- Case 2:
  - Missing Follow-up Call (recommended but not done).

- Case 3:
  - Credit Check took longer than 24 hours after application (desideratum: within 24h).
  - Inform Applicant took longer than 48 hours after Loan Decision (desideratum: within 48h).
  - Missing Follow-up Call.

3. Interpretations/Justifications:

For Case 2's normative issues:
- The out-of-order steps might be due to a system error or human mistake in process flow.
- The missing Inform step could be an oversight in logging, but per rules, it's required.
- Finalizing docs after rejection might be an error in following the decision outcome.

For desiderata in Case 2 and 3:
- Delays in Credit Check or Informing could be due to workload or technical issues, but not excused by the rules.
- Missing Follow-up Calls might be due to resource constraints or deemed unnecessary for straightforward cases, but it's a best practice.

I need to make sure not to suggest that any normative violations can be justified, since they are strict rules. Only the desiderata can have possible reasons.

</think>


### **1. Normative Process Behavior Violations**  
**Case 2** violates **three strict normative rules**:  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**:  
  The process performed *Risk Assessment* (at 08:20) **before** *Credit Check* (at 09:00). This directly violates the requirement that **Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment**.  
- **Missing "Inform Applicant" step**:  
  After the *Loan Decision (Rejected)* at 09:30, the process skipped *Inform Applicant* entirely. The rule mandates that **Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision**, regardless of the outcome.  
- **Finalize Documentation after rejection**:  
  Following a *Loan Decision (Rejected)*, the process proceeded to *Finalize Documentation* (at 10:00). This violates the rule that **if rejected, documentation must not be finalized before closing**.  

**Cases 1 and 3** comply with all normative rules:  
- **Case 1**: Followed the exact sequence: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Approved Decision  Inform  Finalize  Close.  
- **Case 3**: Sequence was correct (Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Approved Decision  Inform  Finalize  Close), though timing delays occurred (see desiderata below).  

---

### **2. Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict) Failures**  
**Case 2**:  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**:  
  The *Follow-up Call* (a recommended best practice) was not performed before closing the case. While not a violation of strict rules, this represents suboptimal behavior.  

**Case 3**:  
- **Credit Check delayed beyond 24 hours**:  
  The *Credit Check* occurred **2 days after** the *Application Received* (Jan 12  Jan 14). The desideratum recommends completing Credit Check **within 24 hours** of application.  
- **Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48 hours**:  
  After the *Loan Decision (Approved)* on Jan 14 12:00, *Inform Applicant* was not performed until Jan 16 15:00 (**~3 days later**). The desideratum suggests informing applicants **within 48 hours** of the decision.  
- **Missing Follow-up Call**:  
  Like Case 2, no Follow-up Call was conducted before closing.  

**Cases 1 and 2**:  
- **Case 1** met all recommended timing guidelines (e.g., Credit Check within 24h, Inform within 48h of decision).  
- **Case 2’s timing for Credit Check** (20 minutes after application) was within the 24-hour desideratum, but its sequence error overshadowed this.  

---

### **3. Interpretations/Justifications for Observed Behaviors**  
#### **Normative Violations in Case 2**:  
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**:  
  This could result from a **system or human error** (e.g., misconfigured workflow automation). No valid justification exists under the normative rules.  
- **Missing "Inform Applicant"**:  
  This may reflect a **logging omission** (e.g., the step was performed but not recorded). However, per the rules, it is mandatory and cannot be excused.  
- **Finalize Documentation after rejection**:  
  This might stem from **incorrect interpretation of the loan decision** (e.g., a clerical error misclassifying the decision as "approved"). Strictly prohibited.  

#### **Desiderata Failures in Cases 2 and 3**:  
- **Case 2’s delayed Follow-up Call**:  
  The absence of a Follow-up Call could reflect **resource constraints** or a judgment that it was unnecessary for a rejected application. While not required, it is a recommended practice for customer satisfaction.  
- **Case 3’s timing issues**:  
  - **Credit Check delay**: May indicate **backlog or high application volume**, though the desideratum aims to ensure timely processing.  
  - **Delayed Inform Applicant**: Could result from **staffing shortages** or administrative delays, though the recommendation emphasizes prompt communication.  
  - **Missing Follow-up Call**: Similar to Case 2, this might reflect prioritization of efficiency over the recommended practice.  

---

### **Summary**  
| **Case** | **Normative Violations** | **Desiderata Failures** |  
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------------|  
| **1**    | None                     | None                    |  
| **2**    | 3 violations             | 1 (missing Follow-up)   |  
| **3**    | None                     | 3 (Credit Check delay, Inform delay, missing Follow-up) |  

Normative violations in **Case 2** are critical and require immediate correction. Desiderata failures (e.g., delays, missing calls) highlight opportunities for process optimization but are not strictly prohibited.
