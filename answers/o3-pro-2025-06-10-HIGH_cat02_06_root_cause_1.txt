1. Cases with markedly long total resolution times  

   (Time measured from “Receive Ticket” to “Close Ticket”)  
   • Case 101 – 2 h 15 m  
   • Case 103 – 1 h 20 m  
   -----------------------------  ( normal, same-day resolution)  
   • Case 102 – 25 h 10 m  
   • Case 104 – 24 h 10 m  
   • Case 105 – 49 h 05 m   worst case  

     Cases 102, 104 and 105 are the clear outliers.

2. What is driving the slow-downs?  

   a. Escalations to Level-2  
      • Appears in Cases 102 & 105.  
      • After the “Escalate to Level-2 Agent” event there is a long queue before the next activity starts:  
        – Case 102: 2 h 30 m wait until Level-2 begins “Investigate Issue”.  
        – Case 105: 28 h (!) wait until Level-2 begins “Investigate Issue”.  
      • Once Level-2 does start, a further ±19 h elapses before the ticket is resolved.  
      • Escalation therefore adds two distinct delays: (i) queue time for Level-2 to pick the ticket up, (ii) longer investigation / implementation cycle.

   b. Late-day start of “Investigate Issue”  
      • Case 104 enters “Investigate Issue” at 13:00; Cases 102 & 105 enter Level-2 investigation after 14:00.  
      • In every long case, the “Investigate Issue” activity overlaps a shift cut-off (evening), so the work spills over into the next day.  
      • By contrast, fast cases start investigation before 09:00 and finish the same morning.

   c. Waiting time before investigation even begins  
      • Case 104 waits 3 h 30 m between “Assign to Level-1 Agent” (09:30) and “Investigate Issue” (13:00).  
      • Although there is no escalation, this idle period already pushes the ticket into the afternoon and triggers the overnight carry-over noted above.

   d. Minor but systematic early-stage delays  
      • Triage and assignment vary from 5 – 40 minutes.  While not critical alone, they contribute to pushing the whole case further into the day when workload is high.

3. Why these factors lengthen the cycle time & how to address them  

   Factor  Effect  Suggestions  
   -------------------------------------------------------------------  
   1. Limited Level-2 capacity / long Level-2 queue  
       Tickets wait hours (or a full day) before a specialist can pick them up.  
      • Add Level-2 head-count or cross-train senior Level-1 agents.  
      • Introduce time-boxed SLA for “Escalate  Investigate” (e.g. 2 h).  
      • Enable partial overlap of Level-2 shifts with evenings to avoid overnight idle time.

   2. Investigations launched late in the day  
       Work is paused at shift end; 19-hour “overnight” gaps recur.  
      • Move ticket intake cut-off (or prioritize queue) so new investigations start before midday.  
      • Provide after-hours coverage for investigation & resolution tasks.  
      • Encourage agents to schedule quick fixes the same day rather than next-day.

   3. Idle time before investigation on Level-1  
       Case 104 shows 3 h 30 m of waiting even without escalation.  
      • Monitor and cap “Assign  Investigate” waiting time.  
      • Use workload balancing / auto-dispatch to the first available agent.  
      • Surface real-time queue analytics to team leads to intervene early.

   4. High escalation rate itself  
       Every escalation adds at least one extra hand-off and two extra queue chances.  
      • Strengthen knowledge base & training so Level-1 can resolve more issues first time.  
      • Introduce “shadowing” or quick consults with Level-2 before formal escalation.

   5. Early-stage variation (Receive  Triage  Assign)  
       Keeps pushing tickets later into the day.  
      • Automate triage classification.  
      • Use priority flags so urgent tickets jump the queue when first logged.

4. Key take-aways  

   • Cycle-time inflation is driven far more by queuing and shift boundaries than by the actual hands-on work.  
   • Escalations are a strong predictor of delay, but even non-escalated tickets suffer if investigation starts after mid-day.  
   • Combining additional (or staggered) Level-2 coverage with tighter SLAs on waiting times would eliminate the 19–28 h “dead time” seen in Cases 102–105 and bring them into the same-day resolution window observed for Cases 101 & 103.
