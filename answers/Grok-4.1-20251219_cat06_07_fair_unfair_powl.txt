### Explanation of the Models

**Model 1 (with Potential Unfairness)**  
- After `SkillAssessment`, an explicit `XOR` choice (`cultural_xor`) routes applicants either to a neutral `StandardCulturalFitCheck` or to a biased `CommunityAffiliationCheck` that provides a subtle advantage.  
- This XOR branch directly represents the point where unfair preferential treatment can be introduced based on community affiliations.

**Model 2 (Without Unfairness)**  
- The discriminatory XOR branch is completely removed.  
- All applicants go through the exact same `CulturalFitCheck` activity after the skill assessment.  
- The rest of the process (data completeness loop, skill assessment, managerial review, final decision) remains identical, ensuring fairness by enforcing a single evaluation path for cultural fit.

Both models preserve the described loops for data completeness and the overall sequential nature of the hiring process while clearly highlighting the structural difference that introduces or eliminates the potential source of bias.
