To create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining, we will follow the steps outlined in the prompt. The event log will include the following columns: `Case ID`, `Activity Name`, `Timestamp`, `Resource/Actor`, and `Other Attributes`. We will derive activities from the given tables, map timestamps, and enrich the events with resources and additional attributes where available.

### Final Event Log

### Assumptions Made:
1. For `order_id 1004`, there are no dispatch and arrival dates, invoice, and payment records. Thus, we assume that the order was created but not dispatched, invoiced, or paid.
2. For items picked in multiple line items, each `item_picking_date` is considered a separate event.
3. For orders with multiple deliveries, each delivery is considered a separate event.
4. The `Resource/Actor` column is filled based on the `Resources Table`, mapping resource IDs to names and roles.

This event log provides a comprehensive view of the order process from creation to completion, including all key activities and relevant attributes.
