Starting with the observed patterns, the first irregularity is the very tight distribution between Receive and Approve — an average of roughly 25 hours with a standard deviation of only one hour. That suggests the approvals are happening on an almost clockwork schedule, which is atypical unless the process is highly automated or approvals are being backdated. A second oddity is the long and variable gap between Approve and Notify — averaging a week with a two-day spread — pointing to inconsistent follow-up or possible resource constraints. There's also the suspiciously fast Evaluate-to-Notify transition of just five minutes, which is too quick to be realistic and may mean notification is being triggered without full review. Finally, the short Assign-to-Close interval — only two hours on average — could mean some claims are being closed without going through all necessary steps.

These patterns could stem from several causes. Rigid approval timelines might reflect automated triggers rather than actual review, leading to approvals that don't match the underlying work done. The long delay between approval and notification could be caused by overloaded staff, unclear handoff procedures, or manual data entry bottlenecks. The near-instantaneous evaluation-to-notification jump could indicate a bypass of required checks, perhaps due to misconfigured workflows. And the rapid closure after assignment might occur when claims are auto-closed due to missing data or when adjusters close them without performing evaluation and approval.

To check these possibilities, the following SQL queries can be used:

**1. Find claims where Approve occurs too quickly after Receive**
```sql
WITH event_pairs AS (
    SELECT
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS receive_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_between
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2
      ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     AND ce1.activity = 'R'
     AND ce2.activity = 'P'
     AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        receive_time,
        approve_time,
        seconds_between,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY approve_time) AS rn
    FROM event_pairs
)
SELECT claim_id, receive_time, approve_time, seconds_between
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1
  AND seconds_between < 86400; -- less than 24 hours
```

**2. Identify claims with unusually long delays from Approve to Notify**
```sql
WITH event_pairs AS (
    SELECT
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_between
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2
      ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     AND ce1.activity = 'P'
     AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        approve_time,
        notify_time,
        seconds_between,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY notify_time) AS rn
    FROM event_pairs
)
SELECT claim_id, approve_time, notify_time, seconds_between
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1
  AND seconds_between > 604800; -- more than 7 days
```

**3. Detect claims closed immediately after assignment (skipping Evaluate/Approve)**
```sql
WITH event_pairs AS (
    SELECT
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_between
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2
      ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     AND ce1.activity = 'A'
     AND ce2.activity = 'C'
     AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        assign_time,
        close_time,
        seconds_between,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY close_time) AS rn
    FROM event_pairs
)
SELECT claim_id, assign_time, close_time, seconds_between
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1
  AND seconds_between < 7200; -- less than 2 hours
```

**4. Find claims with Evaluate-to-Notify in under 5 minutes**
```sql
WITH event_pairs AS (
    SELECT
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS eval_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_between
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2
      ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     AND ce1.activity = 'E'
     AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
),
ranked AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        eval_time,
        notify_time,
        seconds_between,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY notify_time) AS rn
    FROM event_pairs
)
SELECT claim_id, eval_time, notify_time, seconds_between
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1
  AND seconds_between < 300; -- less than 5 minutes
```

These queries isolate claims whose event timing deviates from expected norms, making it possible to examine whether certain adjusters, claim types, or regions are more prone to these irregularities.
