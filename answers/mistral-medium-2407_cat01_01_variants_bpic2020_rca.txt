Based on the provided process variants and their associated performance data, there are several potential root causes for performance issues in the process. Here are some possible explanations based on the data:

1. Multiple rejections and resubmissions: Variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions tend to have lower performance and higher cycle times. For example, the variant "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" has a performance of 2,542,497.917 and a frequency of 36, which is significantly higher than the average performance of other variants. This suggests that multiple rejections and resubmissions may be causing delays and negatively impacting performance.
2. Lack of pre-approval: Variants that do not include a pre-approval step tend to have lower performance and higher cycle times. For example, the variant "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" has a performance of 810,187.903 and a frequency of 4,618, which is lower than the average performance of other variants. This suggests that a pre-approval step may help to improve performance by catching errors and issues earlier in the process.
3. Approval by budget owner: Variants that require approval by the budget owner tend to have lower performance and higher cycle times. For example, the variant "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" has a performance of 1,084,338.407 and a frequency of 2,473, which is lower than the average performance of other variants. This suggests that the approval process may be causing delays and negatively impacting performance.
4. Missing information: Variants that are rejected due to missing information tend to have lower performance and higher cycle times. For example, the variant "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" has a performance of 1,947,246.400 and a frequency of 40, which is significantly higher than the average performance of other variants. This suggests that missing information may be causing delays and negatively impacting performance.
5. Declaration saved instead of submitted: Variants where the declaration is saved instead of submitted tend to have lower performance and higher cycle times. For example, the variant "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" has a performance of 0.000 and a frequency of 134, which is significantly lower than the average performance of other variants. This suggests that declarations that are saved instead of submitted may be causing delays and negatively impacting performance.

In summary, the root causes for performance issues in the process may include multiple rejections and resubmissions, lack of pre-approval, approval by budget owner, missing information, and declarations saved instead of submitted. By addressing these issues, it may be possible to improve the performance and efficiency of the process.
