### Anomalies and Hypotheses

#### Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - **Average Time:** ~25 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (very low)
   - **Potential Issue:** Unusually short and consistent time between receiving a claim and approving it, which is suspiciously low and might suggest an artificial process rather than a realistic workflow.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - **Average Time:** 7 days
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days (high)
   - **Potential Issue:** Highly variable and long wait times between approval and notification, which could indicate backlogs, resource constraints, or inconsistent handling times.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour (moderate)
   - **Potential Issue:** Quick closure times that might suggest some claims are skipped through critical evaluation stages or prematurely closed.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - **Average Time:** 5 minutes
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute (low)
   - **Potential Issue:** Extremely quick transition between evaluation and notification, which might indicate automation or skipping necessary steps.

#### Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Exist

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - **Hypothesis:**
     - **Automated Approval System:** Claims might be automatically approved by an algorithm without thorough evaluation.
     - **Bulk Processing:** Some claims could be processed in bulk at predefined intervals, leading to a very consistent timing pattern.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - **Hypothesis:**
     - **Resource Constraints:** Limited resources or staffing issues might cause delays.
     - **Internal Backlog:** A backlog in the notification system could result in inconsistent notification times.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - **Hypothesis:**
     - **Premature Closure:** Claims might be closed prematurely without completing all necessary steps, due to miscommunication or system errors.
     - **Automated Closure:** Some claims might be automatically closed without human intervention.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - **Hypothesis:**
     - **Automated Notification System:** Evaluations could be automatically followed by standard notifications without manual intervention.
     - **Shortcutting Process:** Evaluations could be done in a way that skips necessary checks or intermediate steps.

### Verification Approaches using SQL Queries

1. **Identify specific claims where the time between certain activities falls outside expected ranges:**

```sql
-- Identify claims with unusually short or long times between Receive and Approve
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) / 60 AS minutes,
    activity,
    additional_info
FROM
    claim_events
WHERE
    activity IN ('R', 'P')
ORDER BY
    claim_id,
    timestamp;
```

2. **Correlate these anomalies with particular adjusters, claim types, or resources:**

```sql
-- Check if certain adjusters or resources have consistently unusual times between activities
SELECT
    claim_id,
    resource,
    activity,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) AS seconds
FROM
    claim_events
ORDER BY
    claim_id,
    timestamp;
```

3. **Filter by claims closed immediately after assignment or claims where approval to notification takes excessively long:**

```sql
-- Identify claims closed immediately after assignment
SELECT
    claim_id,
    resource,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) / 3600 AS hours
FROM
    claim_events
WHERE
    activity IN ('A', 'C')
ORDER BY
    claim_id,
    timestamp;

-- Identify claims where approval to notification takes excessively long
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) / 86400 AS days
FROM
    claim_events
WHERE
    activity IN ('P', 'N')
ORDER BY
    claim_id,
    timestamp;
```

4. **Check if these patterns align with particular customer or region segments:**

```sql
-- Filter by customer_id or region and check the time between activities
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    a.region,
    ce.activity,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - lag(ce.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp))) / 86400 AS days
FROM
    claims c
JOIN
    claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
JOIN
    adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id
WHERE
    ce.activity IN ('P', 'N')
ORDER BY
    c.claim_id,
    ce.timestamp;
```

These queries will help in identifying claims with unusual temporal patterns, correlating these anomalies with specific resources or claim types, and understanding whether these patterns align with particular customer segments or geographic regions.
