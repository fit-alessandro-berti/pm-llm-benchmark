# Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

## Summary of Normative Process Rules

Based on the textual description, I've identified the following key constraints:

1. **Process must start with "Receive order"**
2. **"Check inventory" must occur after "Receive order"** and before any decisions about payment or fulfillment
3. **"Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory"** and before "Package items"
4. **"Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment"** and before "Ship order"
5. **"Ship order" must occur after "Package items"** and never after "Cancel order"
6. **"Cancel order"** should only occur when inventory is insufficient, leading directly to "Close order"
7. **"Close order" must be the final activity** in all scenarios

**Expected sequences:**
- **Sufficient inventory:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close
- **Insufficient inventory:** Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

## Case-by-Case Analysis

### Case 1:  **NO VIOLATION**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This case follows the expected flow for sufficient inventory perfectly. All activities occur in the correct order.

---

### Case 2:  **VIOLATION**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items**  **Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment"

**Explanation:** The normative description explicitly states that *"'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped"* and *"'Authorize payment' should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging."* 

In Case 2, items are packaged at 10:00 while payment authorization doesn't occur until 10:30. This violates the rule that payment must be authorized before items are packaged. The rationale is that an organization shouldn't invest resources in preparing items for shipment until payment validity has been confirmed.

### Case 3:  **VIOLATION (Multiple)**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order**  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"** - The description explicitly states *"'Ship order' should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation"* and *"Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)."*

2. **Mixing fulfillment and cancellation paths** - The case authorizes payment but then cancels the order, yet still proceeds to ship. This is internally inconsistent. If the order was canceled (presumably due to insufficient inventory), shipping should never occur.

3. **"Ship order" occurs without "Package items"** - Even ignoring the cancellation issue, shipping occurs without the items ever being packaged, which violates *"'Ship order' should only occur after packaging."*

This case represents a severe process violation where an order is both canceled AND shipped, which is logically contradictory.

---

### Case 4:  **NO VIOLATION**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This case follows the expected flow for insufficient inventory perfectly. The order is received, inventory is checked (presumably found insufficient), the order is canceled, and then properly closed.

---

### Case 5:  **VIOLATION**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violation:** "Ship order" occurs **without** "Package items"

**Explanation:** The normative description states *"'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped"* and *"Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"*

In Case 5, the "Package items" activity is entirely missing. The process jumps directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order," skipping the essential packaging step. Items cannot logically be shipped without first being packaged.
