This image displays a process model, likely depicting a business workflow, using a notation similar to Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs).

The main part of the visualization is a flowchart showing a sequence of activities and decision points:

1.  **Start:** The process begins with activity 'a' ("register request").
2.  **Initial Processing:** Following 'a', there's an OR-split, meaning one or more of the subsequent activities can be initiated: 'b' ("examine thoroughly"), 'c' ("examine casually"), or 'd' ("check ticket").
3.  **Ticket Check Loop:** Activity 'd' ("check ticket") leads to an XOR-split. One path goes towards the decision stage ('e'), while the other goes to 'f' ("reinitiate request"). Activity 'f' loops back to the OR-split after 'a', suggesting a potential rework or re-evaluation based on the ticket check.
4.  **Decision Point:** Activities 'b', 'c', and the path from 'd' (or the loop from 'h') converge via an OR-join before activity 'e' ("decide"). This means the process proceeds to 'e' once any of the preceding paths are completed.
5.  **Outcome Branch:** Activity 'e' is followed by an XOR-split, representing a decision. The process takes exactly one of two paths: either to 'g' ("pay compensation") or 'h' ("reject request").
6.  **Rejection Loop:** Activity 'h' ("reject request") has a loop back to the OR-join just before 'e', indicating that a rejection might lead to reconsideration or further processing before a final decision.
7.  **End:** Both paths from 'g' and 'h' eventually converge via an XOR-join to the final step 'z' ("end"), signifying the completion of the process.

Below the main flowchart, a grey inset box serves as a **legend**, explaining the different types of connectors (splits and joins) used in this notation:

*   **Splits (outgoing arrows):**
    *   **XOR-split:** One input path branches into multiple output paths, but only *one* path is taken (exclusive choice).
    *   **AND-split:** One input path branches into multiple output paths, and *all* paths are taken concurrently (parallel execution).
    *   **OR-split:** One input path branches into multiple output paths, and *one or more* paths can be taken.
*   **Joins (incoming arrows):**
    *   **XOR-join:** Multiple input paths merge into one output path. The process continues when *any one* of the input paths completes.
    *   **AND-join:** Multiple input paths merge into one output path. The process continues only after *all* input paths have completed (synchronization).
    *   **OR-join:** Multiple input paths merge into one output path. The process continues when *one or more* of the input paths have completed.

In summary, the visualization details a process for handling a request, involving initial registration, examination (potentially multiple types or based on a ticket check), a decision step, possible outcomes (compensation or rejection), and loops for re-initiation or reconsideration, using specific logical connectors (XOR, AND, OR splits/joins) defined in the legend.
