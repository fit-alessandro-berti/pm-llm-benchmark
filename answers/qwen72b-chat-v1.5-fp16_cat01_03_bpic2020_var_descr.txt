The data you provided seems to represent a sequence of events or actions within an administrative process, possibly related to expense declarations or approvals in a corporate setting.

Based on the frequency and performance values, here's a general outline of the process:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: An employee submits a declaration, likely for approval of expenses.

2. **Declaration APPROVED/REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION/BUDGET OWNER/PRE\_APPROVER/SUPERVISOR/MISSING**: The declaration goes through several stages of review and approval or rejection by various parties such as administrative staff, budget owners, supervisors, and potentially an automated pre-approval system.

3. **Request Payment / Payment Handled**: If the declaration is ultimately approved, a payment request is made, followed by the handling of the payment.

The process seems to involve multiple layers of approvals, rejections, and resubmissions, which can lead to varying degrees of efficiency as measured by the performance values in the data.
