The image is a flowchart that outlines the process of dispatching goods from a computer hardware shop to a customer, involving various departments and steps. The flowchart is divided into two main sections: Logistics and Warehouse.

### Logistics Section:
1. **Ship Goods**: This step involves initiating the shipment process.
2. **Clarify Shipment Method**: Here, the method of shipping (e.g., courier, delivery service) is clarified.
3. **Check if Insurance is Required**: Depending on the answer, the process branches into two paths:
   - If insurance is not required, it proceeds directly to "Write Package Label."
   - If insurance is necessary, it goes through additional steps before reaching "Write Package Label."

4. **Get 3 Offers from Logistic Companies**: After determining whether insurance is needed, three offers from different logistic companies are obtained.
5. **Select Logistic Company and Place Order**: Based on the offers received, a company is selected, and an order is placed.
6. **Fill Out Shipment Paperwork**: The necessary paperwork for the shipment is completed.
7. **Move Package to Pickup Area**: The package is moved to the designated pickup area for final preparation.

### Warehouse Section:
1. **Package Goods**: The goods are packaged in this section.
2. **Notify Customer about Delay**: If there is a delay, the customer is notified.
3. **Shipment Prepared**: Once all processes are complete, the shipment is considered prepared for dispatch.

### Visual Elements:
- **Arrows**: Indicate the direction of the workflow.
- **Boxes**: Represent different stages or decision points in the process.
- **Decision Points**: Marked by diamonds, these indicate where decisions need to be made based on certain conditions (e.g., whether insurance is required).
- **Labels**: Provide descriptions of each stage or decision point.

### Summary:
This flowchart illustrates a systematic approach to handling shipments from a computer hardware shop, ensuring that all necessary steps, including insurance requirements and logistics coordination, are addressed before the package is ready for dispatch.
