This visualization depicts a laboratory testing workflow system with three main components:

## (a) Two product classes connected through two channels
This is the main workflow diagram showing the interaction between healthcare professionals and laboratory processes. Key elements include:

**Actors (shown as stick figures):**
- Doctor (initiates orders)
- Lab assistants (handle sample collection and results)
- Chemical analysts (perform tests and create reports)

**Main processes (rectangles):**
- Order entry and Order system
- Take blood sample
- Receive result and Judge results
- Perform test and Make report
- Various re-testing processes (Do tests again, Perform test again, etc.)
- Send report

**Communication channels:**
- Numbered connectors (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) showing process flow
- HIS (Hospital Information System) integration points
- Dashed lines indicating system boundaries or groupings

## (b) Class diagram
Shows the relationship between two product classes:
- **Lab visit** and **Lab test** boxes
- Connected by a "requires" relationship
- Cardinality notation (1..1 and 1..*) indicating one lab visit requires one or more lab tests

## (c) Example of a performative
A table showing message/communication structure with columns:
- Time (11:00)
- Channel (Order system)
- Sender (Lab visit - John)
- Receivers (Lab test - HGB John)
- Action (Create)
- Content (Can you perform a HGB test for John?)
- Scope (Private)
- Direction (OUT)

This appears to be a formal specification of a healthcare laboratory workflow system, possibly for system design or process documentation purposes.
