Here’s a case-by-case assessment, separating hard (normative) violations from soft (desiderata) deviations, plus plausible explanations.

Part 1: Normative (strict) compliance
- Case 1: Compliant
  - Correct order: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
  - No forbidden actions.

- Case 2: Violations
  - Risk Assessment done before Credit Check (violates “Credit Check before Risk Assessment”).
  - Inform Applicant missing (violates “Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision”).
  - Loan Decision = Rejected, but Finalize Documentation performed (forbidden after rejection).
  - Case closed after performing the forbidden finalization.
  - Net: multiple strict rule breaches.

- Case 3: Compliant
  - Correct order and decision-dependent behavior: Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
  - No forbidden actions.

Part 2: Desiderata (recommended) compliance
- Case 1: Mostly meets desiderata
  - Credit Check within 24 hours of Application: yes (30 minutes).
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Decision: yes (~2 hours).
  - Follow-up Call: not observed in the log (recommended but optional). If it did not occur, that’s a minor deviation.

- Case 2: Desiderata status is overshadowed by normative breaches
  - Credit Check within 24 hours of Application: yes (~1 hour).
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Decision: cannot assess because “Inform Applicant” is missing (already a strict violation).
  - Follow-up Call: not observed (minor deviation if indeed skipped).

- Case 3: Desiderata deviations
  - Credit Check within 24 hours of Application: no (~49 hours; minor timing deviation).
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Decision: no (~51 hours; minor timing deviation).
  - Follow-up Call: explicitly not performed (minor deviation).

Part 3: Possible interpretations and justifications
- Case 1:
  - Represents ideal, policy-compliant execution. If the Follow-up Call was intentionally skipped to streamline approved cases, this is acceptable under the “recommended” guidance.

- Case 2:
  - The early Risk Assessment may reflect operator error, a misconfigured workflow (e.g., a risk screen launched automatically before credit data is ready), or a logging/mislabeling issue (e.g., a preliminary risk triage logged as “Risk Assessment”).
  - “Finalize Documentation” after rejection could indicate misuse of a generic activity label for preparing a rejection letter. If so, the activity should be renamed/split (e.g., “Prepare Rejection Notice” vs. “Finalize Loan Documentation”) to avoid violating the policy by design.
  - Missing “Inform Applicant” might mean the applicant was informed outside the system (email/phone) without logging. If that’s common, improve logging discipline or integrate communication channels so the event is captured.

- Case 3:
  - The long delays likely stem from resource constraints, waiting for third-party credit bureau responses, holidays/weekends, or workload spikes.
  - To improve, introduce timers/alerts: auto-escalate if Credit Check >24h after Application; remind case owners to inform applicants within 48h of Decision; nudge for an optional Follow-up Call before Close Case.

Summary
- Normative violations: Case 2 only (ordering, missing “Inform Applicant,” and forbidden finalization after rejection).
- Desiderata deviations:
  - Case 1: Possibly skipped Follow-up Call (minor).
  - Case 2: Possibly skipped Follow-up Call (minor; timing not assessed due to missing Inform step).
  - Case 3: Late Credit Check; late Inform Applicant; skipped Follow-up Call (all minor).
