After analyzing the provided declarative constraints, I have identified some anomalies in the proposed process model:

1.  **Circular Reference**: The process model contains several circular references that violate the "Always Before" and "Always After" constraints. For example:
    *   ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR') (circular reference between two FOR_APPROVAL activities)
    *   ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER') (circular reference between two FOR_APPROVAL activities)
    *   ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER') (circular reference between two FOR_APPROVAL activities)
    These circular references may indicate that the process model is not properly synchronized, potentially leading to inconsistencies.
2.  **Inconsistent Always Before and Always After Constraints**: The "Always Before" and "Always After" constraints do not always align. For example:
    *   ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'): always before, but also declared as the opposite in some never together constraints
    *   ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER'): always after does not apply, neither does always before, nor never together. The never together constraints make it seems like those activities can’t be in the same case.
    Inconsistent constraints may lead to ambiguous or contradictory behavior in the process model.
3.  **Conflicting Activity Occurrences**: The activity "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" has a bound of 7, which seems unusually high for a process that deals with approval and payment verification.
4.  **Inconsistent Access to Activities**: The process model allows various users (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER etc) to perform the same activities and access some activities from the beginning or nearly anywhere, without clear motivation why for example Kitchen staff gets equal access as Finance Office Staff. Elements don't match the nominal activity list, some changes are deemed needed.
5.  **Information Flow Inconsistencies**: 
    *   The "Directly-Follows Constraints" indicates that after 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' or 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' can occur. However, other constraints indicate that 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' is usually followed by
