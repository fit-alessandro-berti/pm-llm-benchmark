### **Analysis of Insurance Claims Processing Event Log**

We are tasked with identifying **cases with performance issues** (i.e., long lead times), analyzing the influence of **Resource**, **Region**, and **Complexity**, and proposing root causes and mitigation strategies.

---

##  **Step 1: Calculate Lead Time for Each Case**

Lead time = (Timestamp of "Close Claim" – Timestamp of "Submit Claim")

| Case ID | Submit Claim (Start) | Close Claim (End) | Lead Time (Hours) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2001   | 2024-04-01 09:00       | 2024-04-01 10:30  | **1.5 hours**     |
| 2002   | 2024-04-01 09:05       | 2024-04-02 11:00  | **25.92 hours**   |
| 2003   | 2024-04-01 09:10       | 2024-04-03 09:30  | **48.33 hours**   |
| 2004   | 2024-04-01 09:20       | 2024-04-01 10:45  | **1.42 hours**    |
| 2005   | 2024-04-01 09:25       | 2024-04-04 14:30  | **77.08 hours**   |

>  **Threshold for "Performance Issues":** Cases taking **> 24 hours** are considered significantly delayed.

###  **Cases with Performance Issues:**
- **Case 2002:** 25.92 hours
- **Case 2003:** 48.33 hours
- **Case 2005:** 77.08 hours

>  **Case 2001 and 2004** are fast (under 2 hours) — efficient baseline.

---

##  **Step 2: Attribute Analysis – Root Cause Investigation**

Let’s analyze **Complexity**, **Region**, and **Resource** across the slow cases.

###  A. Complexity Analysis

| Case ID | Complexity | Lead Time | Notes |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------|
| 2001   | Low        | 1.5 h     | Fast |
| 2002   | Medium     | 25.9 h    | Slower than expected |
| 2003   | High       | 48.3 h    | Very slow |
| 2004   | Low        | 1.4 h     | Fast |
| 2005   | High       | 77.1 h    | **Slowest** |

 **Observation:**  
- All **high-complexity claims (2003, 2005)** are among the slowest.
- **Medium complexity (2002)** is also delayed, though less than high-complexity ones.

 **Hypothesis:** Complexity correlates strongly with longer processing times.

---

###  B. Region Analysis

| Case ID | Region | Lead Time |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| 2001   | A      | 1.5 h     |
| 2002   | B      | 25.9 h    |
| 2003   | A      | 48.3 h    |
| 2004   | B      | 1.4 h     |
| 2005   | B      | 77.1 h    |

 **Observation:**
- **Region B** has **two slow cases (2002, 2005)**, but **one fast case (2004)**.
- **Region A** has **one slow case (2003)** and one fast (2001).
- So **Region alone is not the sole cause** — but **Region B has higher variance**.

 **Key Insight:**  
- Case 2004 (Region B, Low complexity) is fast  shows Region B **can** be efficient.
- But **Cases 2002 and 2005 (Region B, Medium/High complexity)** are slow  suggests **Region B struggles with complex claims**.

 **Hypothesis:** Region B may have **limited capacity or expertise** for high-complexity claims, or **poor coordination** when complexity increases.

---

###  C. Resource Analysis

Let’s examine **Resource** across slow cases:

| Case ID | Resource (Evaluate/Request) | Resource (Approve/Pay) | Notes |
|--------|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| 2002   | Adjuster_Lisa               | Manager_Ann / Finance_Carl | Medium complexity, 1 request |
| 2003   | Adjuster_Mike               | Manager_Bill / Finance_Alan | High complexity, **2 requests** |
| 2005   | Adjuster_Lisa               | Manager_Bill / Finance_Carl | High complexity, **3 requests** |

 **Key Observations:**
- **Adjuster_Lisa** handles **2002 and 2005** (both slow), but also **2004 (fast)**  so **resource is not inherently slow**.
- **Adjuster_Mike** handles **2003 (slow)** and **2001 (fast)**  again, not a consistent bottleneck.
- **Manager_Bill** appears in **2003 and 2005** — both high-complexity cases.
- **Finance_Carl** appears in **2002, 2005** — both slow, but also in **2004 (fast)**  not a bottleneck.

 **Critical Pattern:**
- **High-complexity claims (2003, 2005)** required **multiple "Request Additional Documents"**:
  - Case 2003: 2 requests (11:00, 17:00)  **6 hours apart**
  - Case 2005: 3 requests (11:30, 17:00, 15:00 next day)  **10+ hours between requests**
- This indicates **incomplete or delayed follow-up** — **documentation is not being resolved quickly**.

 **Hypothesis:** The **main bottleneck is not the resource**, but the **inability to resolve document requests efficiently** — especially in **high-complexity claims**.

---

##  **Step 3: Root Cause Summary**

| Root Cause | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|
| **1. High Complexity  Multiple Document Requests** | Cases 2003 and 2005 required **2–3 requests** for additional documents, significantly increasing lead time. |
| **2. Delayed Resolution of Document Requests** | Long gaps between document requests (e.g., 6 hours in 2003, 10+ hours in 2005) suggest **lack of urgency or follow-up**. |
| **3. Region B Shows Inconsistency with Complexity** | Region B processes **low-complexity claims fast (2004)** but **struggles with medium/high-complexity claims (2002, 2005)**. Suggests **lack of specialized resources or training** in Region B. |
| **4. Resource Not the Primary Issue** | Same resources (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill) handled both fast and slow cases — **context (complexity, region) matters more than individual resource**. |

---

##  **Step 4: Proposed Explanations & Mitigation Strategies**

###  **Explanation of Performance Issues:**

- **High-complexity claims** inherently require more scrutiny and documentation.
- However, **poor handling of document requests** (e.g., delays in sending, lack of follow-up, unclear instructions) **exponentially increases processing time**.
- **Region B**, while capable of handling simple claims, lacks **process rigor or support** for complex claims — possibly due to:
  - Fewer experienced adjusters
  - Inadequate templates or guidelines
  - Poor communication between claimant and adjuster
- **Multiple request cycles** indicate **feedback loops** — the claimant may not provide complete documents, or the request is unclear, leading to repeated back-and-forth.

---

###  **Recommendations to Improve Performance:**

| Issue | Solution |
|------|---------|
| **1. High number of document requests due to unclear requirements** |  Implement **standardized checklists** for each complexity level. Provide claimants with **clear, itemized lists** of required documents upfront. |
| **2. Delays between document requests** |  Introduce **SLAs for document submission** (e.g., 24–48 hours to respond). Use **automated reminders** to claimants and staff. |
| **3. Region B struggles with complex claims** |  **Assign high-complexity claims to Region A or a centralized team**. Alternatively, **train Region B staff in complex claim handling** with mentorship from Region A. |
| **4. Lack of process visibility** |  Implement **real-time dashboards** showing:
  - Number of document requests per case
  - Time between requests
  - Bottleneck detection (e.g., long wait after "Request Documents")
| **5. Inconsistent approvals** |  Introduce **approval workflows** based on complexity:
  - Low: Auto-approve if documents complete
  - Medium: Review by one manager
  - High: Multi-level review + documentation audit |
| **6. Resource workload imbalance** |  Monitor **workload per resource** and redistribute high-complexity cases based on capacity and expertise. |

---

##  **Final Summary:**

| Case | Performance Issue? | Root Cause |
|------|--------------------|------------|
| 2001 | No | Low complexity, fast process |
| 2002 | Yes | Medium complexity, Region B, 1 document request (but still slow — possible follow-up delay) |
| 2003 | Yes | High complexity, Region A, **2 document requests**, long gaps |
| 2004 | No | Low complexity, Region B, fast |
| 2005 | Yes | High complexity, Region B, **3 document requests**, very long delays |

>  **Top Root Causes:**
> 1. **Multiple document requests** due to **incomplete or unclear requirements**.
> 2. **Lack of timely follow-up** on document submissions.
> 3. **Region B’s inability to handle high-complexity claims efficiently**.

---

##  **Conclusion:**

> **The primary driver of long lead times is not the resource or region alone, but the interaction between *high complexity* and *inefficient document management*.**

**Action Plan:**
- Standardize document request templates by complexity.
- Enforce SLAs for responses.
- Redirect high-complexity claims from Region B to specialized teams.
- Monitor and audit document request cycles in real time.

By addressing **process design and communication gaps**, not just individual performance, insurers can reduce lead times significantly — especially for high-complexity claims.
