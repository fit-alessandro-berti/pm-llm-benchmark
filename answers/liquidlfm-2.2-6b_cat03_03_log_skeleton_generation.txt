**Explanation of the `LOG_SKELETON` dictionary:**

- **`activ_freq`**:
  - Each activity has a set that defines its allowable occurrence count. Here, we assume that most processes have exactly one occurrence per step (though `activ_freq` can be extended to reflect variability if needed).
  - For example, `'PO': set()` implies that the number of Pack Order instances per case is unbounded.
  - Dispatches like `'D'`, `'IC'`, and `'RP'` have `None` or empty sets because typically they only occur once (immediately after the preceding activity) and don't repeat.

- **`always_before`** is left empty as no activities strictly require to always be before others beyond implicit sequence from `never_together` or other constraints.
  
- **`always_after`** is similarly not applicable beyond inferred sequences:
  
- **`never_together`** enforces that Pick Items (`PI`) and Pack Order (`PO`) cannot occur in the same step (assuming these are sequential sub-processes within a larger step). We could expand this set with additional combinations based on process logic.

- **`directly_follows`** captures immediate sequential relationships:
  - After Check Availability (`CA`), Reserve Items (`RI`) must occur directly next.
  - After Pick Items (`PI`), Quality Check (`QC` is directly after).
  - After Pack Order (`PO`), Generate Shipping Label (`GSL`).
  - After Dispatch (`D`), Invoice Customer (`IC`).
  - After Invoice (`IC`), Record Payment (`RP`).

This structure enables reasoning about valid sequence models akin to those in Petri nets or state machines, supporting analysis, scheduling, or constraint validation for the order fulfillment process.
