### Anomaly Identification and Hypothesis

Upon reviewing the provided event log data, several anomalies and potential undesirable behaviors can be identified:

1. **Skipping of Steps in the Process**:
   - Case 1002 skips the "Validate Stock" step before "Confirm Shipment".
   - Case 1003 skips the "Validate Stock" and "Confirm Shipment" steps before shipping goods.
   - Case 1004 receives payment before issuing an invoice and confirming shipment, which is not the standard process flow.

2. **Out of Order Activities**:
   - In Case 1002, "Perform Credit Check" is done after "Ship Goods", which is out of the normal process flow.
   - In Case 1003, "Confirm Shipment" occurs after "Ship Goods", indicating a potential error in the logistics process.
   - In Case 1004, activities related to payment and invoicing are initiated before the shipment is confirmed, which could lead to discrepancies in financial records.

3. **Potential Data Entry Errors**:
   - The "additional_info" column in some cases contains data that might be more appropriately stored in separate columns for easier analysis (e.g., credit scores, stock check results).

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

- **System Errors**: The out-of-order activities and skipped steps might be due to software bugs or integration issues between different systems used by the sales, finance, and logistics departments.
- **Policy Violations**: Employees might be bypassing certain steps to expedite the process, possibly due to pressure to meet targets or lack of proper training on the importance of each step.
- **Training Issues**: Staff members might not fully understand the standard operating procedures, leading to irregularities in the process flow.
- **Data Entry Mistakes**: Errors in logging events could lead to incorrect or missing information, affecting the overall quality of the event log data.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Further Investigation

#### 1. Identify Cases with Skipped Steps

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT oel.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel
WHERE oel.activity NOT IN ('Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment')
ORDER BY oel.case_id;
```

However, given that all activities are accounted for in the log, we need to check for sequences:

```sql
SELECT oel1.case_id
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id AND oel1.event_id = oel2.event_id - 1
WHERE (oel1.activity = 'Register Order' AND oel2.activity NOT IN ('Perform Credit Check'))
   OR (oel1.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND oel2.activity NOT IN ('Validate Stock'))
   OR (oel1.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND oel2.activity NOT IN ('Confirm Shipment'))
   OR (oel1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND oel2.activity NOT IN ('Ship Goods'))
   OR (oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND oel2.activity NOT IN ('Issue Invoice'))
   OR (oel1.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND oel2.activity NOT IN ('Receive Payment'));
```

#### 2. Investigate Out of Order Activities

This would involve checking the timestamp of each activity to ensure they follow the expected sequence:

```sql
SELECT oel1.case_id, oel1.activity, oel1.timestamp, oel2.activity, oel2.timestamp
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id AND oel1.event_id = oel2.event_id - 1
WHERE oel1.timestamp > oel2.timestamp;
```

#### 3. Analyze "additional_info" for Credit Scores and Stock Check Results

```sql
SELECT case_id, activity, additional_info
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock');
```

#### 4. Examine Payment and Invoicing Irregularities

```sql
SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, o.orders
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE oel.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND oel.timestamp < (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND case_id = oel.case_id);
```

These queries can help in understanding the anomalies better and guide further investigation into the causes of these irregularities.
