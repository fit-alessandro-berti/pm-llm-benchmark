Below is a structured, endtoend approach tailored for Speedy Parcels. It combines process mining techniques with logistics domain knowledge to uncover inefficiencies and translate them into actionable improvements.

# **1) Process Discovery & Conformance Checking**

## **1.1 Data Preprocessing & Integration**
**Goal:** Build a cohesive event log suitable for process mining.

**Key steps**
- **Define case notions:**  
  - **Route/VehicleDay case** (e.g., `V1220241205`) for endtoend route performance.  
  - **Package case** for deliverylevel performance.  
  - Use **object-centric mining** or **hierarchical logs** to link packages to vehicledays.
- **Unify timestamps & IDs:**  
  - Convert to common timezone, align system clocks, reconcile vehicle/driver/package IDs.
- **Event abstraction from GPS:**  
  - High-frequency GPS data must be condensed into meaningful events such as:
    - *Depart Depot, Arrive Customer, Travel Segment, Traffic Delay, Idle/Unplanned Stop, Return Depot*  
  - Identify stops via speed thresholds + location clustering.
- **Merge sources:**  
  - **Dispatch** adds planned stop sequence, time windows, capacity, route ID.  
  - **Scanner events** add delivery milestones.  
  - **Maintenance logs** add downtime events.
- **Add attributes:**  
  - Route type (urban/suburban), customer type, stop number, planned order, weather, etc.

**Typical challenges**
- Different granularity (GPS vs scanner events)
- Missing scans or GPS gaps
- Duplicate timestamps / outoforder events
- Multiple objects per event (vehicle + package + customer)

---

## **1.2 Process Discovery**
Use algorithms such as:
- **Inductive Miner** (structured, noiserobust)
- **Heuristic/Fuzzy Miner** (to reduce complexity)

**Outcome:** A model showing actual behavior:
```
Start Shift  Route Assigned  Depart Depot  (Travel  Arrive Customer  Deliver Success/Fail  Depart) × N  Return Depot  End Shift
```
Includes optional paths like:
- Unplanned stops  
- Maintenance interruptions  
- Failed deliveries  reattempt loops

Overlay **performance metrics** (avg. waiting time, travel time, service time) on the model.

---

## **1.3 Conformance Checking (Planned vs Actual)**
Use **alignment-based conformance** to compare actual traces against planned routes.

**Deviation types to look for**
- **Sequence deviations:** deliveries out of planned order
- **Skipped stops:** planned but not delivered
- **Extra stops:** detours, breaks, unauthorized stops
- **Time window violations:** late/early deliveries
- **Timing gaps:** long idle or unexpected delays
- **Distance deviation:** actual km vs planned km

**Metrics**
- Fitness / Precision
- Deviation count per route
- Detour ratio (actual vs planned distance)
- Time window compliance %

---

# **2) Performance Analysis & Bottleneck Identification**

## **2.1 Key KPIs and How to Compute**
| KPI | Calculation from Log |
|-----|-----------------------|
| **OnTime Delivery Rate** | % deliveries completed within requested time window |
| **Average Service Time** | `Depart Customer – Arrive Customer` |
| **Travel Time per Stop** | `Arrive Stop(n) – Depart Stop(n1)` |
| **Travel vs Service Ratio** | Travel / Service per route |
| **Vehicle Utilization** | (Travel + Service time) / total shift |
| **Fuel per km / per package** | Fuel usage (or estimated) / km or packages |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | # failed attempts / total attempts |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency** | count & duration of lowspeed events offstop |
| **Maintenance Downtime** | duration of unscheduled/maintenance events |

---

## **2.2 Bottleneck Identification Techniques**
- **Performance overlay on process model**: highlights slow transitions or activities.
- **Variant analysis**: compare highperforming vs lowperforming routes.
- **Resource analysis**: identify drivers/vehicles with abnormal durations.
- **Spatial heatmaps**: locate traffic hotspots and long dwell locations.
- **Timeofday analysis**: detect peak congestion patterns.
- **Clustering**: group routes by delay patterns or stop density.

**Quantifying impact**
- Delay contribution per hotspot
- Extra minutes leading to late deliveries
- Fuel waste from idling
- Overtime due to specific route segments

---

# **3) Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

**Potential root causes & how process mining validates them:**

### **A. Suboptimal Routing**
- Evidence: frequent sequence deviations, detours, backtracking.
- Analysis: conformance alignment + detour ratio.

### **B. Inaccurate Travel Time Estimates**
- Evidence: consistent lateness despite route adherence.
- Analysis: compare planned vs actual travel durations.

### **C. Traffic Congestion**
- Evidence: lowspeed GPS events clustered by time/location.
- Analysis: correlate congestion intervals with delivery delays.

### **D. High Service Time Variability**
- Evidence: long dwell times at specific customers or zones.
- Analysis: dwell time distribution by customer type/location.

### **E. Breakdown / Maintenance Disruptions**
- Evidence: unscheduled stops correlated with delays or overtime.
- Analysis: link maintenance logs to route performance.

### **F. Driver Behavioral Differences**
- Evidence: large variance in idle time, detours, service time.
- Analysis: resource analysis + performance comparisons.

### **G. Failed Deliveries**
- Evidence: repeated attempts, high failure rate in specific windows.
- Analysis: failed delivery patterns by area/time window.

# **4) DataDriven Optimization Strategies**

Below are **five concrete strategies** (at least three required), each linked to root causes and KPIs.

---

## **Strategy 1 — Dynamic, TrafficAware Routing**
**Targets:** Late deliveries, traffic delays  
**Root cause:** Static routing ignores congestion  
**Process mining evidence:** Frequent delays in specific corridors/time slots  
**Action:**  
- Use historical + realtime traffic to resequence stops.  
- Adapt ETAs dynamically within time windows.

**Expected KPI impact:**  
-  Travel time  
-  Ontime delivery rate  
-  Fuel consumption

---

## **Strategy 2 — Territory & Route Redesign**
**Targets:** Overtime, long routes, low utilization  
**Root cause:** Unbalanced stop density and route length  
**Evidence:** Some routes consistently exceed shift length / capacity  
**Action:**  
- Recluster customers into balanced territories using historical service/travel times.  
- Adjust depot departure times based on congestion patterns.

**Expected KPI impact:**  
-  Overtime  
-  Vehicle utilization
