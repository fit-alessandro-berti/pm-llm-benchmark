Based on the scenario of a complex global supply chain for high-tech electronics, here is a Python dictionary representing the estimated temporal profile. The times are provided in seconds.

The estimations reflect common process durations and variabilities:
*   **Procurement and Supplier Interaction (`SS`, `OP`, `RC`)**: Characterized by long lead times and high variability due to global logistics and supplier dependencies.
*   **Internal Manufacturing (`QI`, `CA`, `PT`)**: Generally has shorter, more controlled durations but can be affected by quality issues or assembly line complexity.
*   **Logistics and Distribution (`PK`, `WS`, `DT`, `AS`)**: Involves quick, automated steps (like packaging) and highly variable steps (like storage and shipping).

    # Order Placement to Receive Components: The main supplier lead time, long and variable.
    # Avg: 21 days, StDev: 7 days
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1814400, 604800),

    # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: Handoff to the assembly line after inspection.
    # Avg: 1.5 days, StDev: 12 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (129600, 43200),
    
    # Product Testing to Packaging: A fairly standardized and quick transition.
    # Avg: 4 hours, StDev: 1 hour
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 3600),

    # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: Time until a shipment is scheduled, can be highly variable.
    # Avg: 5 days, StDev: 3 days
    ('WS', 'DT'): (432000, 259200),

    # --- Pairs of Activities Separated by Multiple Steps ---

    # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: The entire procurement cycle.
    # Avg: ~23 days, StDev: ~7 days (dominated by the OP->RC leg)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1987200, 610000),

    # Order Placement to Component Assembly: Spans lead time, receiving, and inspection.
    # Avg: ~23 days, StDev: ~7 days
    ('OP', 'CA'): (1972800, 606000),

    # Receive Components to Product Testing: The core manufacturing and quality process.
    # Avg: ~4.8 days, StDev: ~1.1 days
    ('RC', 'PT'): (417600, 98000),

    # Component Assembly to Distribution: The entire post-assembly logistics chain.
    # Avg: ~10 days, StDev: ~3.2 days
    ('CA', 'DT'): (878400, 275000),
    
    # Distribution to After-Sales Support: Represents the final delivery time to the customer.

    # --- Full Process Pairs ---

    # Supplier Selection to Product Testing: From initial decision to a finished, tested product.
    # Avg: ~30 days, StDev: ~7.2 days
    ('SS', 'PT'): (2570400, 625000),

    # Supplier Selection to After-Sales Support: The entire process duration from start to finish.
