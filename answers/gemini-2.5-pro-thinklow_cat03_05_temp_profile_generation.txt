Based on the described global supply chain process, here is a Python dictionary representing a plausible temporal profile. The average times and standard deviations are estimated in seconds to reflect the complexity, potential delays, and varying nature of each step, from rapid internal handoffs to long-haul international logistics.

This dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs, covering both directly subsequent activities and those separated by multiple steps, as required by the prompt.
