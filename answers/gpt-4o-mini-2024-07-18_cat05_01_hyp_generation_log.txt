## Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors in Event Log

### Identified Anomalies:

1. **Early Shipment Confirmation:**
   - **Case ID 1002:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity occurred before the "Ship Goods" activity (timestamp of 08:25 for Confirm Shipment, 08:40 for Ship Goods). This indicates that the shipment was confirmed before it was actually shipped.

2. **Missing Activity Sequence:**
   - **Case ID 1004:** The "Receive Payment" activity (timestamp of 09:05) occurred before the "Issue Invoice" (09:20) and "Confirm Shipment" (09:25). Payments should typically come after the invoice is issued.

3. **Timing Anomalies:**
   - **Case ID 1003:** The "Ship Goods" (09:10) happened significantly earlier than the subsequent "Confirm Shipment" (09:45). This contradicts the expected order of operations where confirmation should follow shipment.

### Hypotheses Regarding Anomalies:

1. **Early Shipment Confirmation (Case ID 1002):**
   - **System Error:** There could be a glitch in the system allowing the confirmation of a shipment before it has taken place.
   - **Policy Violation:** The process may not have been followed appropriately, leading to a premature confirmation.
   - **Training Issue:** Staff may lack understanding of the sequential nature of the required activities.

2. **Missing Activity Sequence (Case ID 1004):**
   - **System Issue:** The order processing system may not correctly enforce the sequence of invoicing and payment.
   - **Operational Error:** An employee may have recorded the payment information without waiting for the invoice.
   - **UI/UX Problem:** If the interface for recording these actions is confusing, it could lead to errors.

3. **Timing Anomalies (Case ID 1003):**
   - **Human Error:** The staff might have manually entered the shipment details into the system without confirmation, leading to a mismatch in timestamps.
   - **System or Process Miscommunication:** There may be inadequate information sharing between departments (e.g., if Logistics and Finance do not communicate well).

## SQL Queries to Investigate Hypotheses

### 1. Query for Early Shipment Confirmation (Case ID 1002)

```sql
SELECT case_id, 
       MIN(timestamp) AS early_confirm_time, 
       MAX(timestamp) AS late_ship_time 
FROM order_event_log 
WHERE case_id = 1002 AND activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods') 
GROUP BY case_id;
```

### 2. Query for Missing Activity Sequence (Case ID 1004)

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM order_event_log 
WHERE case_id = 1004 
AND activity IN ('Receive Payment', 'Issue Invoice', 'Confirm Shipment') 
ORDER BY timestamp;
```

### 3. Query for Timing Anomalies in Case ID 1003

```sql
SELECT case_id, 
       activity, 
       timestamp 
FROM order_event_log 
WHERE case_id = 1003 
AND activity IN ('Ship Goods', 'Confirm Shipment') 
ORDER BY timestamp;
```

### 4. Cross-Reference Orders for Confirmation and Payment Timing

```sql
SELECT ol.case_id, o.order_value, ol.activity, ol.timestamp 
FROM order_event_log AS ol 
JOIN orders AS o ON ol.case_id = o.case_id 
WHERE activity IN ('Receive Payment', 'Issue Invoice') 
ORDER BY ol.case_id, ol.timestamp;
```

### 5. Review Resource Roles and Activities to Identify Potential Errors

```sql
SELECT ol.resource, 
       r.role, 
       r.department, 
       COUNT(ol.event_id) AS total_events, 
       STRING_AGG(ol.activity, ', ') AS activities 
FROM order_event_log AS ol 
JOIN resources AS r ON ol.resource = r.resource_id 
GROUP BY ol.resource, r.role, r.department 
HAVING COUNT(ol.event_id) < 5 -- Example threshold
ORDER BY total_events;
```

These queries should help delve deeper into the identified anomalies, uncovering potential root causes and facilitating process improvements.
