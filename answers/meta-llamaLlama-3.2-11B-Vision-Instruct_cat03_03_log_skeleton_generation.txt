**Log Skeleton for Order Fulfillment Process**

```python
order_fulfillment_log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set([('RO', 'CA')]),  # Receive Order and Check Availability are equivalent
    'always_before': set([('CA', 'RI')]),  # Check Availability must come before Reserve Items
    'always_after': set([('RO', 'PI'), ('RO', 'QC')]),  # Receive Order must be followed by Pick Items or Quality Check
    'never_together': set([('PI', 'QC')]),  # Pick Items and Quality Check cannot co-exist
    'activ_freq': {'RO': {1}, 'CA': {1}, 'RI': {1}, 'PI': {1}, 'QC': {1}, 'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1}, 'D': {1}, 'IC': {1}, 'RP': {1}},  # Each activity occurs once
    'directly_follows': set([('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')])  # Directly follows constraints
}
```

**Notes:**

1. **Equivalence Constraint**: Receive Order and Check Availability are considered equivalent, as both are essential initial steps in the process.

2. **Always Before Constraint**: Check Availability precedes Reserve Items, as this order ensures accurate allocation of items for the new order.

3. **Always After Constraint**: Receive Order directly precedes either Pick Items or Quality Check, as these are immediate activities following the order's introduction.

4. **Never Together Constraint**: Pick Items and Quality Check should not overlap, allowing the process to progress linearly from receiving the order to shipping.

5. **Activity Occurrences Constraint**: Each activity can occur only once in the order fulfillment process.

6. **Directly-Follows Constraints**: Following the **Always After** constraint, Check Availability must be directly followed by Reserve Items; Reserve Items by Pick Items; and so on, to maintain a streamlined workflow.

To represent this scenario, the Log Skeleton contains relationships and constraints between the activities, guiding the order fulfillment process to ensure that: Orders are received and availability is checked; reserved items are accurately picked and inspected; accurate parcels are packed and delivered; and records of payment updated.
