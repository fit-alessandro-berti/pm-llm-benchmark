The structure of the branching here is critical: it's not a neutral gatekeeper but a conditional modifier that applies an extra advantage to one path. Because the check for local affiliation is followed by a score uplift, the applicants who take that path end up with a better credit score than those who bypass it. If selection into that path is driven by factors that correlate with protected characteristics—say, through socioeconomic patterns that influence local residency or community group membership—then the uplift becomes unevenly distributed, even if the membership itself isn't legally protected.

That's the subtlety: the bias isn't in the decision rule itself, but in the way it's activated. Those who happen to qualify for the extra step gain an advantage, while others, even if equally qualified, don't. Over time, this compounds, potentially shifting approval rates in ways that mirror existing social inequalities. The model may appear fair on paper—everyone gets the same potential boost—but in practice, the boost is gated, making it less accessible to some groups.

The equity impact is twofold: it creates a systematic tilt in favor of one group, and it does so in a way that can be hard to detect without granular demographic analysis. Even if the uplift is small, repeated application across many decisions can produce measurable disparities in outcomes. To mitigate this, the uplift would need to be either applied universally or tied to a truly neutral criterion, and the selection mechanism itself should be examined for hidden correlations with protected attributes.
