# **Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Operations**

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To perform process mining, the first step is to integrate data from multiple sources (GPS, scanner, dispatch, maintenance) into a unified event log. Key challenges include:

- **Event Alignment:** Ensuring timestamps from different systems are synchronized (e.g., GPS logs may be more frequent than scanner events).
- **Attribute Mapping:** Standardizing attributes like `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, and `Package ID` across datasets.
- **Handling Missing/Inconsistent Data:** Some events (e.g., failed deliveries) may not be logged consistently.
- **Event Correlation:** Linking related events (e.g., a "Low Speed Detected" GPS event may correlate with a "Traffic Jam" note).

**Approach:**
- **Event Log Structure:**
  - **Case ID:** `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., `V12-20241205`) to track a vehicle’s daily operations.
  - **Activities:** Derived from event types (e.g., `Depart Depot`, `Arrive Customer`, `Delivery Success`).
  - **Timestamps:** Used for sequence and duration analysis.
  - **Attributes:** `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID`, `Location`, `Speed`, `Notes`.

### **Process Discovery**
Using process discovery algorithms (e.g., **Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner, or Fuzzy Miner**), we can visualize the actual delivery process, including:
- **Planned vs. Actual Routes:** Comparing dispatch-assigned routes with GPS-derived paths.
- **Deviations:** Unplanned stops (e.g., breakdowns, traffic delays).
- **Failed Deliveries:** Frequency and impact on overall efficiency.

### **Conformance Checking**
We compare the discovered process against the planned routes from the dispatch system to identify:
- **Sequence Deviations:** If deliveries are made out of order.
- **Time Deviations:** If actual travel times exceed planned estimates.
- **Unplanned Stops:** Maintenance issues, traffic jams, or driver detours.

**Key Deviations to Monitor:**
- **Route Adherence:** Did the driver follow the assigned route?
- **Time Window Compliance:** Were deliveries made within customer-requested windows?
- **Failed Delivery Impact:** How often do failed deliveries lead to re-deliveries?

## **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
| **KPI**                     | **Calculation**                                                                 | **Relevance**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate**   | `(Successful Deliveries within Time Window) / (Total Deliveries)`             | Measures punctuality and customer satisfaction.                             |
| **Average Time per Stop**   | `(Time Depart Customer - Time Arrive Customer) / (Number of Stops)`          | Identifies inefficiencies in service time.                                  |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time** | `(Total Travel Time) / (Total Service Time)`                                | High ratio indicates excessive driving time.                               |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | `(Fuel Used) / (Total Distance Traveled)`                                   | Helps optimize fuel efficiency.                                             |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | `(Total Operating Hours) / (Total Available Hours)`                          | Measures fleet efficiency.                                                  |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency** | `(Number of Low-Speed Events) / (Total Driving Time)`                        | Identifies traffic hotspots.                                               |
| **Failed Delivery Rate**    | `(Failed Deliveries) / (Total Delivery Attempts)`                           | High rate increases re-delivery costs.                                     |

### **Bottleneck Identification**
Using **performance spectrum analysis** and **bottleneck detection techniques**, we can identify:
- **Route-Specific Bottlenecks:** Certain routes may have higher traffic delays.
- **Time-of-Day Bottlenecks:** Rush hours may cause delays.
- **Driver-Specific Bottlenecks:** Some drivers may take longer per stop.
- **Vehicle-Specific Bottlenecks:** Older vehicles may have more breakdowns.
- **Customer Interaction Bottlenecks:** Long service times at certain stops.

**Quantifying Impact:**
- **Cycle Time Analysis:** Identify stages with the longest durations.
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Link delays to external factors (e.g., traffic, weather).

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes**
1. **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
   - Static routes may not account for real-time traffic.
   - Poorly optimized sequences (e.g., far stops early in the day).

2. **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
   - Dispatch system may underestimate traffic delays.

3. **High Variability in Service Time:**
   - Some customers take longer to receive packages (e.g., requiring signatures).

4. **Vehicle Breakdowns:**
   - Unscheduled stops due to maintenance issues.

5. **Driver Behavior:**
   - Some drivers may idle excessively or take longer routes.

6. **Failed Deliveries:**
   - High re-delivery rates increase costs.
