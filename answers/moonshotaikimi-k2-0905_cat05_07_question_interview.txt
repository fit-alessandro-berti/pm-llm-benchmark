1. Could you walk me through a recent example of a property that took an unusually long time to onboard and explain what specifically caused the delays?  
2. When the property coordinator first reviews documents, what are the top three deal-breakers that would immediately pause the process, and who decides whether those issues can be waived?  
3. How do you measure a property manager’s “current workload,” and what formal criteria trigger the decision to reassign an existing manager’s properties to keep the new assignment balanced?  
4. What happens if every qualified property manager in that city is at capacity—who escalates the decision to open a new head-count or reassign properties across regional boundaries?  
5. During the introductory call, which party (landlord or manager) typically raises the most unexpected conditions, and how are those conditions documented so they are not lost later in the process?  
6. Once the inspector identifies issues, how is the urgency of each repair categorized, and who ultimately signs off that the repair scope is sufficient before re-inspection?  
7. Can you describe a situation where the landlord refused to make a repair flagged by the inspector, and what escalation path the company followed?  
8. How far in advance do you schedule the photographer and inspector, and what contingency plans exist if either vendor cancels at the last minute?  
9. When the marketing team updates internal pricing models, what data sources override each other—for instance, if an automated algorithm conflicts with a local manager’s market intuition, who has final say?  
10. Tell me about a time a compliance officer rejected a lease that had already been signed—how was the conflict resolved and how did you prevent re-occurrence?  
11. How do you track which landlord communications are still “open” versus “closed,” and what metric defines an acceptable response time for each stakeholder group?  
12. What criteria determine whether a property requires special insurance, and at what exact step does that requirement first surface?  
13. When multiple qualified tenants apply, can you describe the weighting scheme you use to rank them, and whether that scheme ever varies by neighborhood or landlord preference?  
14. Who physically hands over the keys on move-in day, and what checklist do they follow to confirm the unit condition aligns with the earlier inspection?  
15. How are custom lease clauses flagged in your CRM so that downstream teams (maintenance, accounting, legal) know they exist without re-reading the full lease?  
16. If a regional office and the central support team disagree on whether an onboarding exception is justified, what governance body meets to make the final call, and within what time frame?  
17. Could you share an example of an external stakeholder—such as a city inspector or condo board—that unexpectedly entered the process mid-stream and how you adapted?  
18. What post-mortem or retrospective review happens after a property is activated, and what specific metrics determine whether the onboarding was considered “successful”?  
19. How do you ensure that any incentives or promotional discounts offered during tenant negotiation are still compatible with the company’s profitability targets, and who audits that alignment?  
20. Finally, if you could change one thing about the overall sequencing or communication flow to reduce rework, what would it be and why?
