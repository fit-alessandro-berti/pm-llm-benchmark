### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive (R) to Approve (P):**
   - The average time is ~25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation (1 hour). This suggests a rigid or automated approval process that does not account for variability in claim complexity or adjuster workload.

2. **Approve (P) to Notify (N):**
   - The average delay is 7 days with a high standard deviation (2 days), indicating inconsistent notification timing. This could reflect backlogs, manual intervention, or external dependencies.

3. **Assign (A) to Close (C):**
   - The average time is only 2 hours, which is suspiciously short. This may indicate claims are being closed prematurely, bypassing required steps like evaluation or approval.

4. **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N):**
   - The average time is just 5 minutes, which is unrealistically fast. This could imply missing intermediate steps or automated notifications triggered immediately after evaluation.

### Hypotheses for the Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - Hypothesis: Approvals are being automated or batch-processed at fixed intervals, ignoring claim complexity.
   - Alternative: A subset of claims (e.g., low-value or pre-approved claims) follows a fast-track approval process.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - Hypothesis: Notifications are delayed due to manual processing (e.g., physical mail) or bottlenecks in the notification system (e.g., email queue delays).
   - Alternative: Some claims are held for fraud review before notification, causing variability.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - Hypothesis: Some claims are closed without proper evaluation (e.g., fraudulent claims rejected immediately after assignment).
   - Alternative: Automated claims (e.g., small amounts) are closed quickly without full processing.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - Hypothesis: Notifications are triggered automatically immediately after evaluation, bypassing approval steps (possible process defect).
   - Alternative: Some claims skip approval due to system errors or manual overrides.

### SQL Queries for Verification

#### 1. Identify claims with unusually short/long R to P times:
```sql
WITH r_to_p_times AS (
  SELECT
    ce1.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_seconds
  FROM claim_events ce1
  JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
  WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P' AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
)
SELECT
  claim_id,
  time_seconds,
  AVG(time_seconds) OVER () AS avg_time,
  STDDEV(time_seconds) OVER () AS stdev_time
FROM r_to_p_times
WHERE time_seconds > (SELECT AVG(time_seconds) + 3 * STDDEV(time_seconds) FROM r_to_p_times)
   OR time_seconds < (SELECT AVG(time_seconds) - 3 * STDDEV(time_seconds) FROM r_to_p_times);
```

#### 2. Investigate P to N delays by adjuster/region:
```sql
SELECT
  c.claim_type,
  a.region,
  a.name AS adjuster_name,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))) AS avg_p_to_n_seconds,
  COUNT(*) AS claim_count
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND p.timestamp < n.timestamp
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON p.resource = a.name
WHERE p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY c.claim_type, a.region, a.name
ORDER BY avg_p_to_n_seconds DESC;
```

#### 3. Check for claims closed too quickly after assignment:
```sql
SELECT
  a.claim_id,
  a.timestamp AS assign_time,
  c.timestamp AS close_time,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_seconds
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id AND a.timestamp < c.timestamp
WHERE a.activity = 'A' AND c.activity = 'C'
AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < 7200  -- Less than 2 hours
ORDER BY a_to_c_seconds;
```

#### 4. Verify if E to N times are artificially short (missing steps):
```sql
SELECT
  e.claim_id,
  e.timestamp AS eval_time,
  n.timestamp AS notify_time,
  p.timestamp AS approve_time
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND e.timestamp < n.timestamp
LEFT JOIN claim_events p ON e.claim_id = p.claim_id AND e.timestamp < p.timestamp AND p.activity = 'P'
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
AND (p.timestamp IS NULL OR p.timestamp > n.timestamp)  -- Notify happened before approve (or approve missing)
ORDER BY EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp));
```

#### 5. Correlate anomalies with claim types/amounts:
```sql
SELECT
  c.claim_type,
  AVG(c.claim_amount) AS avg_claim_amount,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))) AS avg_e_to_n_seconds
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND e.timestamp < n.timestamp
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY avg_e_to_n_seconds;
```

These queries will help identify patterns in the anomalies and correlate them with claim attributes, adjusters, or regions.
