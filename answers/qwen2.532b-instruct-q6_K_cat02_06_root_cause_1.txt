### Analysis

To identify cases with significantly longer total resolution times, we first calculate the duration from receiving the ticket to closing it for each case.

#### Case Duration Calculation:
- **Case 101**: 
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
  - End: 2024-03-01 10:15
  - Total Time: 2 hours and 15 minutes

- **Case 102**: 
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
  - End: 2024-03-02 09:15
  - Total Time: 1 day, 1 hour and 10 minutes

- **Case 103**: 
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
  - End: 2024-03-01 09:30
  - Total Time: 1 hour and 20 minutes

- **Case 104**: 
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
  - End: 2024-03-02 08:30
  - Total Time: 1 day and 1 hour and 10 minutes

- **Case 105**: 
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
  - End: 2024-03-03 09:30
  - Total Time: 2 days, 1 hour and 5 minutes

### Identification of Longer Cases:
From the above calculations, it is clear that **Cases 102**, **104**, and **105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to Case 101 (2 hours and 15 mins) and Case 103 (1 hour and 20 minutes).

### Root Cause Analysis:
To determine potential root causes, we examine the activities in each case:

- **Case 102**: 
  - Escalation to Level-2 Agent occurred after investigation by a Level-1 agent.
  - Investigating issue took from 14:00 on 03/01 to 09:00 on 03/02 (approximately 17 hours).
  
- **Case 104**: 
  - Investigation began at 13:00 on 03/01 and resolved by 08:00 on 03/02, which is about 9 hours later.
  
- **Case 105**:
  - Escalation to Level-2 Agent occurred after an initial investigation by a Level-1 agent.
  - Second investigation began at 14:00 on 03/02 and resolved by 09:00 on 03/03, which is about 17 hours later.

### Potential Root Causes:
1. **Escalation to Higher Levels**:
   - Cases 102 and 105 both required escalation to Level-2 agents.
   - This suggests that complex issues are not being adequately addressed by Level-1 agents, leading to increased resolution times.

2. **Long Waiting Times Between Activities**: 
   - In Case 104, the ticket was assigned on 03/01 at 09:30 but investigation started only after a significant delay (at 13:00).
   - In Cases 102 and 105, there are long delays between investigation activities.

### Recommendations:
To address these performance bottlenecks:

1. **Training for Level-1 Agents**:
   - Enhance the skills of Level-1 agents to handle more complex issues without immediate escalation.
  
2. **Efficient Escalation Process**:
   - Develop a clear and streamlined process for escalating tickets that cannot be resolved by Level-1 agents.

3. **Reducing Delays Between Activities**:
   - Ensure minimal delays between activities such as assigning the ticket to an agent and starting the investigation.
   
4. **Improved Resource Allocation**:
   - Evaluate the workload distribution among support agents, ensuring that no single agent is overwhelmed with too many tickets at once.

5. **Automated Tracking and Alerts**:
   - Implement automated tracking systems for ticket statuses and provide timely alerts when a ticket remains idle for an extended period to prompt action.
   
By addressing these issues, it should be possible to reduce the overall cycle times and improve customer support efficiency.
