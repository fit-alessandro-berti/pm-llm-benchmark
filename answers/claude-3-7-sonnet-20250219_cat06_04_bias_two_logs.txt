# Analysis of Potential Bias in Decision Logs

After examining both event logs, I can identify that Group B (Unprotected Group) appears to benefit from preferential treatment that is not available to Group A (Protected Group), creating a systematic bias in the decision-making process.

## Evidence of Bias

### 1. Community Boost Score Adjustment

The most obvious bias appears in the form of a "Community Boost" score adjustment:

- **Group A (Protected)**: No score adjustments are applied to any applicants
- **Group B (Unprotected)**: Members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a +10 point "Community Boost" adjustment

### 2. Impact on Decisions

This score adjustment has a direct impact on approval decisions:

- Case U003 had a preliminary score of 695, which would likely result in rejection
- After the +10 Community Boost, the score became 705, resulting in approval
- Meanwhile, case P002 in Group A had a score of 710 with no adjustment and was rejected

### 3. Systematic Pattern

The bias is systematic because:
- It only benefits members of Group B (all LocalResident = TRUE)
- It specifically benefits those with community group affiliations
- It creates an approval threshold difference between the two groups

## Factors Contributing to Bias

### 1. LocalResident Status

All members of Group B are marked as "TRUE" for LocalResident, while all members of Group A are marked as "FALSE". This suggests a geographic or residency-based discrimination.

### 2. Community Group Affiliation

The "Highland Civic Darts Club" membership appears to be a proxy for preferential treatment:
- Only available to local residents (Group B)
- Provides a significant scoring advantage (+10 points)
- Not accessible to members of Group A

### 3. Score Threshold Manipulation

The score adjustment effectively lowers the approval threshold for Group B members:
- U003 was approved with an original score of 695 (adjusted to 705)
- P002 was rejected with a score of 710 (no adjustment)

## Conclusion

The decision system exhibits clear bias against Group A (Protected Group) by:

1. Providing score boosts exclusively to members of Group B
2. Using community group membership as a mechanism for preferential treatment
3. Creating different effective approval thresholds between the groups
4. Linking preferential treatment to local residency status

This system disadvantages non-local residents (Group A) who cannot access the same score adjustments, resulting in different treatment for otherwise similarly qualified applicants.
