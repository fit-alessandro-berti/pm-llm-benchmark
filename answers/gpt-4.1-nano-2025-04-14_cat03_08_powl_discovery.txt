Based on the provided event log, the complex process can be represented as a POWL model capturing the core activities, decision points (choices), looped quality checks, and the concurrent or sequential relationships among activities. Here's an outline of the process:

1. **Start** with "Order Received" (OR).
2. **Material sourcing** (MS) follows.
3. **Quality screening** (QS).
4. **Parallel activities:** Assembly (AS) can either proceed directly or after multiple quality checks (IQC) and possible re-testing (RT).
5. **Loops:** The IQC and RT represent a loop where multiple quality re-inspections occur in sequence, depending on the outcome.
6. **Decision points:** After assembly, the process moves forward towards testing, packaging, labeling (which may be skipped), and then distribution.

### POWL Diagram Explanation:

- The process begins with a **sequential order** of activities: OR  MS  QS.
- After QS, **concurrency** is introduced with possible activities:
  - Proceed directly to assembly, or
  - Enter a **loop** where IQC and RT activities are repeated as needed before proceeding.
- The **loop node** () models repeated quality checks.
- The subsequent activities (TST, PK, LB, DP, D) follow in order.
- **Labeling (LB)** is skipped in some cases (represented by an immediate path from DP to D).

### Final POWL Model (Representation)

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import (
    StrictPartialOrder,
    Operator,
    Transition,
    SilentTransition
)
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Loop: IQC and RT (quality re-inspection loop)
quality_loop = Operator(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, RT])

# Path after QS: assembly or quality loop leading to assembly
quality_choice = Operator(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    quality_loop,
    SilentTransition()  # represents skipping IQC/RT if not needed
])

# Assembly followed by testing
assembly_and_testing = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[AS, TST])
assembly_and_testing.order.add_edge(AS, TST)

# Testing phase with possible RT cycles (e.g., re-testing)
testing_with_reruns = Operator(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Final stages: Packaging, optional Labeling, Distribution
final_steps = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[PK, LB, DP, D])

# Labeling may be skipped
label_choice = Operator(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    LB,
    SilentTransition()  # skip labeling
])

# Complete process structure
# Start node
start = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS])
start.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
start.order.add_edge(MS, QS)

# After QS, concurrency of assembly or quality control loop
after_qs = Operator(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    assembly_and_testing,
    quality_choice
])

# Assemble the entire process
process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    start, after_qs, final_steps
])

# Add ordering: QS's outcomes
process.order.add_edge(qs, assembly_and_testing)
process.order.add_edge(qs, quality_choice)

# Assembly to testing, then to reruns if needed
process.order.add_edge(assembly_and_testing, testing_with_reruns)

# Testing cycle
# (already connected as a loop in testing_with_reruns)

# Final steps after testing
process.order.add_edge(testing_with_reruns, final_steps)
# Final labeling optional
final_process = Operator(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    final_steps,
    label_choice
])
# Final flow
process.order.add_edge(final_process, D)

### **Summary in plain text:**

```
Start:
   "Order Received" (OR)
  
   "Material Sourcing" (MS)
  
   "Quality Screening" (QS)
         Choice:
              Proceed to "Assembly" (AS), then "Testing" (TST), possibly with re-inspections ("RT") looping.
              Or, choose to skip quality checks and go directly to assembly and testing.
        
         Assembly (AS)
        
         Testing (TST)
              Re-Testing (RT) cycle can repeat as needed.
        
         "Packaging" (PK)
        
         Optional "Labeling" (LB)
        
         "Distribution Planning" (DP)
        
         "Dispatch" (D)
```

This structure captures the core activities, loops, optional steps, and concurrency represented in the event log. The choice operator XOR encodes decision points, the loop operator models re-inspection cycles, and the strict partial order maintains the correct sequence with possibilities for concurrency where applicable.
