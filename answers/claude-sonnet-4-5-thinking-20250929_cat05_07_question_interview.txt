# Clarifying Questions for Property Onboarding Process

## **Process Initiation & Documentation**

1. What triggers the initial contact from landlords들s it purely inbound, or do you have outbound sales efforts? How does that affect the process flow?

2. You mentioned that missing or outdated documents require updates. What's the typical response time you expect from landlords, and what happens if they don't provide the required documentation within that timeframe?

3. Are there any screening criteria that would cause you to reject a property or landlord entirely at this early stage, before even entering documentation review?

4. Who defines what constitutes "compliant" or "acceptable" documentation, and do these requirements vary by city or region?

## **Decision Logic & Criteria**

5. When assigning a property manager, you mentioned four factors (workload, geography, experience, track record). How are these weighted against each other? Is there a formal scoring system, or is this more of a judgment call?

6. What happens if no suitable property manager is available at the time a property is ready for assignment?

7. For the tenant screening process, what are the specific criteria that qualify someone as a "suitable tenant"? How much discretion does the property manager have in this decision?

8. When multiple tenants are interested, you mentioned prioritizing longer leases드re there other tiebreaker criteria, and who makes the final call?

## **Timing & Sequencing**

9. From initial landlord contact to property activation in the portal, what's the typical timeline? What's the fastest you've seen it done, and what's the longest it's taken?

10. Are the photography and inspection visits always done separately, or can they happen simultaneously? What drives that decision?

11. At what point in the process does the property "officially" enter your portfolio from a contractual or financial perspective들s it after documentation, after inspection, or after activation?

12. Can the marketing team begin creating materials before the inspection is fully cleared, or must they wait? What drives this sequencing?

## **Roles & Responsibilities**

13. You mentioned the property coordinator handles initial documentation review. Does this same coordinator stay involved throughout the process, or do they hand off completely once the property manager is assigned?

14. When inspection issues are found and repairs are needed, who bears the cost듮he landlord or the management company? Who manages the contractor relationships and payment?

15. The compliance officer reviews the lease near the end듟o they have authority to block or modify lease terms, or is this more of an advisory check?

16. Who is ultimately accountable if the onboarding process stalls or takes too long? Is there an owner of the end-to-end process?

## **Exception Handling & Edge Cases**

17. You mentioned properties requiring special insurance or landlords wanting custom lease clauses. How common are these exceptions, and how do they change the standard process flow?

18. What happens if a property fails inspection and the landlord refuses or is unable to make the necessary repairs?

19. If a chosen tenant backs out after being selected but before signing the lease, do you go back to other applicants, or restart the screening process entirely?

20. Are there situations where a property might be activated in your system before tenant screening is complete듡or example, to gauge interest or build a waitlist?

## **Communication & Coordination**

21. You mentioned communication is tracked via email, CRM, and project management tools. Who decides which channel to use for what type of communication, and how do you ensure nothing falls through the cracks?

22. How do landlords track the status of their property's onboarding? Is there a self-service portal, or do they need to contact someone directly?

23. When the process requires back-and-forth (like waiting for document updates or repair completion), who is responsible for following up, and how often?

## **Quality & Performance**

24. You mentioned internal audits and quality checks at the end. What happens if issues are discovered at that stage듞an properties be "de-activated" or does the lease stand?

25. What does "success" look like for this onboarding process? What metrics do you use to evaluate whether it's working well?

26. Are there common bottlenecks or pain points where properties tend to get stuck in the pipeline?

27. How do you handle situations where market conditions change significantly during the onboarding process, potentially affecting the expected rental price range that was initially recorded?

## **Scale & Variation**

28. Does this process vary significantly depending on property type (single-family home vs. large apartment complex), or is it fairly standardized regardless of size?

29. How many properties are typically going through this onboarding process simultaneously, and do you have capacity constraints at any particular step?

30. You mentioned the process varies across multiple cities드re there regional variations in the process steps themselves, or just in the requirements and regulations that feed into those steps?

## **Financial & Legal**

31. At what point does the management company start charging the landlord or collecting fees들mmediately upon agreement, after activation, or after a tenant is placed?

32. If a property sits empty for an extended period after activation (no suitable tenants), how does that affect the landlord relationship or the management agreement?

33. Are there service level agreements (SLAs) or performance guarantees promised to landlords regarding how quickly you'll place a tenant?
