Certainly! Here are the opposite and more general concepts for each of the process mining terms you've listed:

### 1. **Automated Process Discovery**
   - **Opposite Concept**: *Manual Process Mapping* - This involves manually creating process models through interviews, workshops, or observation, without the aid of automated tools to extract process models from event logs.
   - **More General Concept**: *Process Modeling* - This encompasses any method (automated or manual) of creating or understanding how processes work, including both discovery and design.

### 2. **Predictive Monitoring**
   - **Opposite Concept**: *Historical Analysis* - Instead of predicting future events or behaviors, historical analysis looks at past data to understand what has already occurred.
   - **More General Concept**: *Process Analytics* - This includes all forms of analysis on processes, from predicting future states to understanding past performance.

### 3. **Bottom-up Discovery**
   - **Opposite Concept**: *Top-down Design* - Here, processes are designed from a strategic overview or business goals downwards, rather than being discovered from existing data.
   - **More General Concept**: *Process Architecture* - This involves designing or understanding the overall structure of business processes, which can include both discovery and strategic design.

### 4. **Process Simulation**
   - **Opposite Concept**: *Real-world Execution* - Instead of simulating processes to predict outcomes, this is the actual execution of processes in real-time with real resources.
   - **More General Concept**: *Process Evaluation* - This includes both simulation and real-world execution to assess how processes perform under different conditions.

### 5. **Process Efficiency**
   - **Opposite Concept**: *Process Complexity* - Focusing on how processes can become more intricate or less streamlined, potentially leading to inefficiency.
   - **More General Concept**: *Process Performance* - This looks at all aspects of how a process operates, including efficiency, but also reliability, effectiveness, and other performance metrics.

### 6. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - **Opposite Concept**: *Post-hoc Analysis* - This involves analyzing process data after the events have occurred rather than in real-time.
   - **More General Concept**: *Process Surveillance* - Encompasses both real-time and post-event monitoring of processes to ensure they meet certain standards or to gather data for analysis.

These explanations aim to contrast the specified process mining techniques with alternative approaches and situate them within broader conceptual frameworks, which can help in understanding the full spectrum of process management and improvement methodologies.
