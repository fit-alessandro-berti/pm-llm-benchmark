### Anomalies Identified:

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: The average time of approximately 25 hours with a very low standard deviation suggests an unusually rigid approval schedule.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: The significant delay of 7 days with a high standard deviation indicates sporadic or unpredictable notification times, potentially due to system bottlenecks or resource constraints.

3. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: The short average waiting time of only 5 minutes may imply quick transitions without thorough processing, possibly bypassing other steps or indicating automated fast-forwarding.

4. **A to C (Assign to Close)**: Rapid closure times of around 2 hours post assignment could suggest claims are prematurely resolved, possibly skipping the evaluation stage or due to expedited handling in certain scenarios.

### Possible Reasons for Anomalies:

1. **Rigid Approval Process**: The short time from receive to approve might indicate a standardized, automated approval system that bypasses manual checks or approvals, leading to unexpected delays.

2. **Delayed Notification**: The lengthy average and high variability in notify times could be due to delayed backend processes, insufficient notifications systems, or human error in setting up notification schedules.

3. **Skipped Evaluation**: The immediate transition from evaluation to notification might mean that evaluations are being automated or skipped entirely if deemed ready for immediate action, potentially bypassing quality checks.

4. **Premature Claim Closure**: Immediate closure after assignment suggests claims may be closed based on partial data or without further investigation, possibly due to administrative oversight or system design issues.

### SQL Queries for Verification:

1. **Identify Claims with Unusual R to P Time:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF('second', timestamp_when_R, timestamp_when_P)) AS avg_RtoP, STDEV(TIMESTAMPDIFF('second', timestamp_when_R, timestamp_when_P)) AS stdev_RtoP
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'R' AND resource LIKE '%Approver%' AND event_type = 'P'
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF('second', timestamp_when_R, timestamp_when_P)) < 25000 OR STDEV(TIMESTAMPDIFF('second', timestamp_when_R, timestamp_when_P)) < 3600;
   ```

2. **Detect Claims with Long P to N Times:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', timestamp_when_P, timestamp_when_N)) AS avg_PtoN, STDEV(TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', timestamp_when_P, timestamp_when_N)) AS stdev_PtoN
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'P' AND resource LIKE '%Notifier%' AND event_type = 'N'
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', timestamp_when_P, timestamp_when_N)) > 7 OR STDEV(TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', timestamp_when_P, timestamp_when_N)) > 2;
   ```

3. **Evaluate E to N Delay:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF('minute', timestamp_when_E, timestamp_when_N)) AS avg_EtotN, STDEV(TIMESTAMPDIFF('minute', timestamp_when_E, timestamp_when_N)) AS stdev_EtotN
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'E' AND resource LIKE '%Evaluator%' AND event_type = 'N'
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF('minute', timestamp_when_E, timestamp_when_N)) > 5 OR STDEV(TIMESTAMPDIFF('minute', timestamp_when_E, timestamp_when_N)) > 1;
   ```

4. **Inspect Claims Closed Immediately After Assign:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', timestamp_when_A, timestamp_when_C)) AS avg_AtoC, STDEV(TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', timestamp_when_A, timestamp_when_C)) AS stdev_AtoC
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity = 'A' AND resource LIKE '%Assigner%' AND event_type = 'C'
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF('day', timestamp_when_A, timestamp_when_C)) < 2;
   ```

These queries aim to pinpoint specific claims exhibiting the anomalies and provide statistical insights into their timing behaviors.
