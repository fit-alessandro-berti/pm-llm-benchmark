To solve for the described task, you need to first identify the number of events for each `case_id`. This requires a subquery that groups events by `case_id` and counts the number of events for each such group. However, you need to filter out any `case_id` where the count of events exceeds six.

Based on this reasoning, you need to:
1. First, for each `case_id`, count the number of events (i.e., rows in the `event_log` table where `case_id` is the same).
2. Filter out any `case_id` where the count of events is greater than six.
3. Return all events (i.e., all rows from the original `event_log` table) where the `case_id` is one of the `case_id` values that has six or fewer events.

Let us break this reasoning into two main parts:
    - First, create a subquery that counts the number of events for each `case_id` and only keeps those `case_id` values where the count is less than or equal to six.
    - Second, join this subquery back to the original `event_log` table to retrieve all events for those `case_id` values that have six or fewer events.

Here is a possible SQL query that implements the steps described:

```sql
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS filtered_cases
ON el.case_id = filtered_cases.case_id;
```

This query works as follows:
1. The inner subquery `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` groups all events by `case_id` and only keeps the `case_id` values where the number of events (i.e., `COUNT(*)`) is less than or equal to six.
2. The main query then performs an `INNER JOIN` with the original `event_log` table (aliased as `el`) using the `case_id` values that were filtered in the subquery. This makes sure that only events from cases with six or fewer events are included in the final result set.

However, another way to achieve the same might be by using a `WHERE` clause along with an `IN` subquery:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

This query:
1. Uses a subquery `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to find `case_id` values where the total number of events is less than or equal to six.
2. The main query then selects all events from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` is one of the `case_id` values identified in the subquery.

Both queries should effectively solve the given task. Another option is to use a window function (which might be a bit less intuitive here but still valid):

```sql
WITH event_counts AS (
    SELECT *,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS case_event_count
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp -- you might need to include all columns here explicitly if there are other columns in `event_log`
FROM event_counts
WHERE case_event_count <= 6;
```

However, a window function might not be as efficient as the first two options because it first computes the count for all case_ids and then filters afterward. However, it makes the reasoning a bit more explicit. 

However, the first two options are likely the most efficient and straightforward. 

Thus, a well-rounded and efficient answer might be:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

However, an `INNER JOIN` might be more efficient than an `IN` clause so the first query might be preferred:
```sql
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS filtered_cases
ON el.case_id = filtered_cases.case_id;
```

Both should work, but the `INNER JOIN` might be more performant in some database systems. However, for DuckDB, `INNER JOIN` and `IN` might have similar performance characteristics. 

Thus, a valid and well-reasoned answer could be:
```sql
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6);
```

However, a more "readable" version might be preferred:
```sql
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS filtered_cases
ON el.case_id = filtered_cases.case_id;
```

Both versions should be valid for the given task.
