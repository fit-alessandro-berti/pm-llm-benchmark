**Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model:**

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: Suspiciously low standard deviation (1 hour) and average time (25 hours) might indicate a rigid, artificial schedule for approval.
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: Extremely long average delay (7 days) with high standard deviation (2 days) indicates possible internal backlogs or resource constraints.
3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**: Relatively quick closure (2 hours on average) after assignment without intermediate steps suggests premature closure.
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: Very short average time (5 minutes) between evaluation and notification might indicate skipping of intermediate steps or too-quick transition.

**Hypotheses on Anomalies:**

1. **R to P**: Systemic delays due to manual data entry causing large time gaps, or automated steps happening too rapidly.
2. **P to N**: Bottleneck in notification process due to resource constraints or excessive wait times for approval.
3. **A to C**: Inconsistent resource availability causing irregular timing patterns, or automated steps skipping required checks.
4. **E to N**: Too-quick transition between evaluation and notification, possibly due to inadequate evaluation processes or automated shortcuts.

**Verification Approaches using SQL Queries:**

1. **Identify Specific Claims:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM claim_events
WHERE (activity IN ('R', 'P') AND timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) > 1000)
   OR (activity IN ('E', 'N') AND timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) < 300);
```
2. **Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters or Claim Types:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM claim_events
JOIN adjusters ON claim_events.resource = adjusters.name
WHERE (activity IN ('R', 'P') AND timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) > 1000)
   AND adjusters.specialization IN ('handwritten', 'resource-intensive');
```
3. **Filter Claims with Abnormal Patterns:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM claim_events
WHERE (activity IN ('P', 'N') AND timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) > 604800)
   AND claim_type IN ('Home Insurance', 'Commercial Property');
```
These queries aim to identify specific claims with anomalies, correlate these with adjuster or claim type information, and filter claims with unusual patterns.
