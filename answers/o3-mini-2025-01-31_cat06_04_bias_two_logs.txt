The logs indicate a systematic difference in treatment that appears to bias outcomes in favor of the unprotected group (Group B). Here’s how the bias manifests:

1. Score Adjustments Favoring Group B:
• In Group B’s log, applicants who are marked as LocalResident (TRUE) and belong to a community group (“Highland Civic Darts Club”) receive a positive ScoreAdjustment—specifically, a +10 boost during PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, and FinalDecision stages.
• In contrast, Group A (the protected group) shows no adjustments; all ScoreAdjustment values are 0. This means that even if their preliminary scores are comparable, Group B applicants are getting an extra boost that Group A applicants never receive.

2. Influence of the LocalResident and CommunityGroup Attributes:
• The LocalResident attribute is TRUE for all Group B entries and FALSE for Group A. This status, combined with membership in a community group, appears to be rewarded through the bonus points.
• The CommunityGroup affiliation in Group B (“Highland Civic Darts Club”) is directly linked to the positive ScoreAdjustment. Group A, on the other hand, does not have any community group association (listed as “None”) and does not receive bonus points. This implies that the system is using these attributes to alter the scores and potentially influence the final decision.

3. Impact on Final Decisions:
• For similar preliminary scores (e.g., around 720 or 710), the additional boosts in Group B can push an applicant over the threshold for approval or at least increase their chances relative to applicants in Group A who receive no boost.
• As seen in the logs, Group B cases with a Community Boost are approved when their adjusted scores (e.g., shifting from 720 to 730) may influence the decision process, while Group A cases remain at their original scores, which could explain why some comparable scores lead to different outcomes.

In summary, the bias stems from the systematic score adjustment given to LocalResidents affiliated with a community group in Group B. This practice gives Group B applicants an advantage in the scoring process, leading to a higher likelihood of favorable final decisions compared to Group A, whose similar initial scores are not enhanced by any bonus adjustments.
