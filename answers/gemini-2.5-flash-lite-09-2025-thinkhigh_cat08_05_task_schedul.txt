This scenario presents a classic, complex shop floor scheduling challenge where traditional heuristic methods fail due to high variability and sequence dependence. The wealth of data available in the MES event logs provides the ideal foundation for migrating from reactive scheduling to a proactive, data-driven optimization framework using Process Mining.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

The initial step is to transform the raw event log data into actionable performance insights. This requires treating the MES log as a high-fidelity recording of the system's actual dynamic behavior.

### A. Reconstructing Actual Job Flow

We will use **Process Discovery** techniques (e.g., Heuristic Miner or a dedicated conformance checking algorithm) applied to the log, keyed by `Case ID` and ordered by `Timestamp`.

1.  **Process Map Generation:** Create a global process map showing the standard path, but critically, overlay **frequency** (how often a path is taken) and **throughput time** (average time taken between steps).
2.  **Variant Analysis:** Identify the $N$ most frequent job variants. Analyze if high tardiness correlates strongly with lower-frequency variants (suggesting complex, unpredictable routings that the current system handles poorly).
3.  **Resource Overlay:** Map resource usage onto the process map to visualize which machines are involved in the longest waiting periods or the longest processing durations.

### B. Quantifying Specific Performance Metrics

| Metric | Process Mining Technique & Data Used | Insight Generated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flow Times & Lead Times** | Group by `Case ID`. Calculate $\text{Time}(\text{Completion}) - \text{Time}(\text{Job Released})$. Analyze the $95^{th}$ percentile to understand the true worst-case scenario driven by queueing and setups. | Variability in delivery promise capability. |
| **Task Waiting Times (Queue Time)** | Calculate $\text{Time}(\text{Queue Entry}) - \text{Time}(\text{Task Start})$ for the subsequent task. Alternatively, for the next step $T_{i+1}$, calculate $\text{Time}(\text{Start}(T_{i+1})) - \text{Time}(\text{End}(T_i))$. | Quantifies the non-value-add time spent waiting at specific work centers, highlighting localized resource constraints or prioritization issues. |
| **Resource Utilization** | Calculate total time spent by a `Resource ID` in three states using timestamps: **Setup**, **Processing** ($\text{Task End} - \text{Task Start}$ where Setup Required=FALSE), and **Idle** (time between tasks where the resource was available but not selected). | Determines true productive time vs. non-productive setup time vs. actual machine downtime. |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times (SDST)** | Focus only on events flagged with `Setup Required = TRUE` at a specific `Resource ID`. For two consecutive jobs $J_A$ and $J_B$ on machine $M$: $SDST(J_A \rightarrow J_B) = \text{Time}(\text{Setup End}(J_B)) - \text{Time}(\text{Task End}(J_A))$. | Generates the actual $N \times N$ setup cost matrix for the shop floor, revealing which job transitions incur the highest overhead. |
| **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness** | Compare $\text{Time}(\text{Task End})$ for the final operation against the `Order Due Date`. Calculate Tardiness Rate and Average Tardiness Magnitude. | Direct quantification of the business impact of current scheduling performance. |
| **Impact of Disruptions** | Use **Event Correlation**. Identify all time windows between `Breakdown Start` and `Breakdown End`, or immediately following a `Priority Change`. Measure the resulting delay ($D_{actual}$) versus the expected run time ($T_{expected}$) for jobs processed during that window. | Isolates the performance degradation caused by unplanned events versus chronic scheduling issues. |

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

By analyzing the metrics generated above, we can pinpoint specific systemic failures:

### A. Bottleneck Identification and Quantification
*   **Process Mining Technique:** Cross-referencing high utilization ($>90\%$ for extended periods) with the longest average **Task Waiting Times** upstream.
*   **Pathology Evidence:** If Machine CUT-01 shows 95% utilization and jobs spend an average of 12 hours waiting before reaching it, CUT-01 is the primary bottleneck. Crucially, we also look for **downstream starvation**: If MILL-03 (downstream) shows low utilization but has jobs waiting, the bottleneck (CUT-01) is starving subsequent processes.

### B. Prioritization Failures (Local Sub-optimization)
*   **Process Mining Technique:** **Variant Comparison**. Filter the process logs into two cohorts: Cohort A (On-Time Jobs) and Cohort B (Late Jobs).
*   **Pathology Evidence:** If Cohort B shows significantly longer waits specifically at the Queue Entry stage, followed by processing of jobs with lower `Order Priority` or later `Order Due Date` relative to the waiting job, it indicates that the local dispatching rules (FCFS/EDD) are failing to account for the true urgency or criticality of the job flow.

### C. Suboptimal Sequencing Overhead
*   **Process Mining Technique:** Analysis of the **SDST Matrix** derived in Section 1.
*   **Pathology Evidence:** If the average setup time on MILL-03 varies between 15 minutes and 120 minutes, yet the current scheduling system treats setup time as a constant (or ignores it), the pathology is clear: the system is making sequencing decisions based on inaccurate cost models, leading to excessive non-productive time.

### D. WIP Accumulation and Bullwhip Effect
*   **Process Mining Technique:** **Buffer Analysis**. Map the time between the completion of a task at Machine A and the start of the next task at Machine B.
*   **Pathology Evidence:** High variance in buffer time, especially when the upstream machine (A) is highly utilized and the downstream machine (B) is underutilized, confirms a classic decoupling point where excess WIP builds up due to sequencing mismatch or poor hand-off synchronization.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Process mining helps distinguish between systemic capacity limits and flawed operational logic:

| Observed Pathology | Likely Root Cause(s) | Process Mining Role in Confirmation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Tardiness & High WIP** | **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:** Simple rules (FCFS, local EDD) are inadequate for handling complex constraints like SDST and dynamic priority changes simultaneously. | Confirmed if the delay patterns do not align with obvious capacity shortages but instead show erratic sequence behavior. |
| **Unpredictable Lead Times** | **High Inherent Variability:** Unaccounted variability in $\text{Task Duration (Actual)}$ vs. $\text{Task Duration (Planned)}$ and high SDST variance. | Confirmed by statistical analysis of mined durations; if the standard deviation of actual times is high, simple deterministic planning fails. |
| **Inefficient SDST Handling** | **Lack of Lookahead & Sequencing Intelligence:** The local scheduling only considers the *current* job, not the future setup penalty associated with the *next* job. | Confirmed by the large, variable setup costs extracted from the historical logs. |
| **Poor Disruption Handling** | **Lack of Reactive Re-optimization:** Disruptions (like JOB-7005 being flagged urgent) are handled reactively, often by simply interrupting the current task, causing ripple effects. | Confirmed by tracing the downstream impact: high queue times immediately following a priority change event, even if the resource becomes free quickly. |
| **Capacity vs. Logic Issues** | **Capacity Limitation:** If key resources are saturated ($>95\%$ utilization) *and* queue times are consistently long even for jobs processed sequentially, the primary issue is capacity. | Process mining isolates this by showing that even perfect sequencing would not resolve the delay, as the resource simply cannot keep up with the required flow rate. |

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

We move beyond local rules toward integrated, predictive, and adaptive strategies informed by the quantified historical performance.

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Priority Dispatching (Informed by Flow Cost)

This strategy addresses the failure of simple static prioritization by integrating real-time queue status and sequence cost into the decision.

*   **Core Logic:** Implement a dynamic priority index ($P_{dyn}$) calculated immediately before selection at the work center buffer.
    $$P_{dyn}(J) = w_1 \cdot \text{Due Date Urgency} + w_2 \cdot \text{Downstream Load Factor} + w_3 \cdot \text{Estimated Sequence Cost}$$
*   **Data Used:**
    1.  **Due Date Urgency:** Mined $\text{Slack Time}$ (Due Date - Current Time).
    2.  **Downstream Load Factor:** Calculated by summing the *estimated remaining processing time* (using mined distributions from Strategy 2) for all jobs already queued or actively processing on machines immediately downstream of the current resource. A high downstream load penalizes jobs that would exacerbate congestion.
    3.  **Estimated Sequence Cost:** Based on the $SDST$ matrix (Section 1). If the previous job $J_{prev}$ was 'Type X' and the candidate job $J$ is 'Type Y', we use the $\text{SDST}(X \rightarrow Y)$ cost as a penalty factor, favoring transitions that minimize setup time if due dates are similar.
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Poor task prioritization and sub-optimal sequencing leading to high setup times.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Significant reduction in **Tardiness** (due to better urgency consideration) and reduction in setup-related **WIP** accumulation (due to better sequencing).

### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Probabilistic Timing Estimates

This directly attacks the "Unpredictable Lead Times" challenge by embedding variability into the scheduling horizon.

*   **Core Logic:** Instead of using single-point estimates for task duration, use statistical distributions derived from historical data. The scheduling system uses these distributions to generate a **Probability Density Function (PDF)** of completion times for the entire job sequence.
*   **Data Used:** Mined $\text{Task Duration (Actual)}$ data, aggregated by Machine, Operator, and Job Type/Complexity (if complexity features can be extracted from job descriptions). Fit these empirical distributions (e.g., Lognormal, Weibull) to establish $\mu$ and $\sigma$ for every known task.
*   **Implementation:** When scheduling Job $J$, the system calculates the $P(Completion \le Due Date)$. This allows for **Risk-Adjusted Scheduling**: selecting the sequence that maximizes the probability of on-time delivery, rather than assuming deterministic times.
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Unpredictable lead times due to process variability.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Improved **Customer Satisfaction** (due to accurate lead time quotes) and better **Schedule Adherence** because the scheduling logic actively avoids paths with high associated delay risk.

### Strategy 3: Bottleneck Sequencing Optimization via Machine Learning Clustering

This focuses specifically on maximizing throughput at the critical bottleneck machines identified in Section 2 (e.g., CUT-01, MILL-03).

*   **Core Logic:** Apply Machine Learning clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) on the job features (material, required tolerance, tooling set) that correspond to the largest historical setup times.
*   **Data Used:** The $\text{SDST}$ matrix, linked back to the original `Case ID` features. Jobs that cluster together historically incur lower transition setup costs.
*   **Implementation:** At the identified bottleneck, the scheduler attempts to pull jobs from the upstream buffer in batches that match the current cluster assignment. If a high-priority job must break the batch sequence, the sequencing penalty (Strategy 1) is triggered, but the system prioritizes maintaining homogeneous batches otherwise.
*   **Pathology Addressed:** Excessive SDST overhead reducing bottleneck throughput.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Direct increase in **Throughput** at the bottleneck resource and reduction in overall **Makespan** for the shop floor.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

Deployment of complex new scheduling rules must be validated rigorously to prevent destabilizing the existing shop floor operations.

### A. Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Validation

A DES model is essential for risk-free testing.

1.  **Parameterization:** The DES model will be parameterized entirely using the mined data:
    *   **Routing:** Use mined routing probabilities to define path choices.
    *   **Timing:** Use the fitted statistical distributions (Strategy 2) for task and setup durations.
    *   **Disruptions:** Use the frequency and duration distributions of breakdowns and hot job arrivals derived from the log analysis.
    *   **Rules:** Implement the baseline (current) dispatching rules, Strategy 1, Strategy 2, and Strategy 3 as selectable dispatching functions within the simulation nodes.

2.  **Scenario Testing:**
    *   **Baseline Run:** Run the model using current rules to establish the simulated benchmark KPI performance.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Simulate worst-case scenarios (e.g., 20% load increase, simultaneous breakdown of two critical resources) to test the robustness of the new strategies.
    *   **Comparative Analysis:** Compare the simulated **Tardiness Rate**, **WIP levels**, and **Bottleneck Utilization** for all proposed strategies against the baseline. Select the strategy offering the best KPI improvement while maintaining acceptable stability margins.

### B. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation Framework

Once the winning strategy (e.g., Strategy 1 enhanced with Strategy 2 timing estimates) is deployed, process mining transitions from a diagnostic tool to a real-time monitoring engine.

1.  **KPI Dashboarding:** Create a live dashboard tracking the critical metrics mined during the analysis phase, comparing actual performance against the targets set by the DES validation phase (e.g., Actual Tardiness vs. Simulated Tardiness Target).

2.  **Drift Detection via Residual Analysis:**
    *   The system continues to record `Task Duration (Actual)` against the expected time estimates ($E$) derived from the predictive models (Strategy 2).
    *   Implement **Control Charts (e.g., CUSUM or EWMA)** on the scheduling residuals: $R = \text{Actual Duration} - E$.
    *   **Trigger:** If the residuals for a specific machine/job type combination begin trending significantly positive (meaning tasks are taking systematically longer than predicted), it signals a **process drift** (e.g., tooling wear, new operator learning curve, or change in material quality).

3.  **Automated Re-Parameterization:** When drift is detected above a predefined threshold, the system automatically flags the affected data segments for an immediate, targeted **re-mining cycle**. This cycle updates the statistical models (duration distributions, SDST matrix) used by the scheduling engine, ensuring the predictive and dynamic rules remain calibrated to the current reality of Precision Parts Inc. This establishes a continuous optimization loop.
