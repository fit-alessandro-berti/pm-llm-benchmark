 The process described by the data appears to be a workflow or business process for handling declarations, which involves multiple steps, approvals, and potential rejections before a final decision or action is taken. The data includes frequency counts and performance metrics for each step in the process. Here's a breakdown of the process based on the provided information:

1. **Declaration Initiation**: An Employee submits a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`). This is the starting point of the process and has several branches depending on the actions taken at each step.

2. **First Level Approval**: The Supervisor reviews the declaration and either approves it as final or requests further payment handling (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` and `Request Payment`).
   - If payment is requested, it eventually gets handled (`Request Payment -> Payment Handled`), and then the declaration may be approved again by the Supervisor (`Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - If the declaration is final-approved, it can then go through additional approvals or be rejected at different stages.

3. **Additional Approvals**: The declaration may go through further levels of approval, including Pre-Approver (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`) and Administration (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`). These steps can also lead to the declaration being submitted back to the employee for further action.

4. **Payment Handling**: If payment is involved, it will be handled at some point after the initial approval or request (`Request Payment -> Payment Handled`), and this step can lead to a final rejection by an Employee (`Payment Handled -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`).

5. **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions**: The declaration can be rejected at various stages by different individuals, including the Supervisor (`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`), Pre-Approver (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`), and Budget Owner (`Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`). In some cases, it is resubmitted back to the Employee after rejection (e.g., `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

6. **Final Approval and Payment**: The process concludes with the final approval of the declaration by the Supervisor, which can also trigger the handling of payment (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled`). There is an outlier case where a high performance value is associated with a single instance of `Request Payment -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`, which might indicate an exceptionally rare or unusual event.

7. **Special Cases and Forgotten Drafts**: There are instances where a declaration saved by the Employee (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`) leads back to the submission stage (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`), suggesting that either the declaration was not completed initially or it was retrieved from a draft state for further action.

8. **Outliers**: There are a few instances where the approval process skips directly to submission (e.g., `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`), and one instance where a high-performance payment handling is done after a rejection by an Employee (`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`).

In summary, the process involves multiple layers of approval with the potential for various outcomes, including the handling of payments and the possibility of rejections leading to resubmission. It's a complex workflow that likely has branches and parallel processes not fully detailed in this snapshot of data. The performance metrics suggest that some steps are faster or slower than others, affecting the overall efficiency of the process.
