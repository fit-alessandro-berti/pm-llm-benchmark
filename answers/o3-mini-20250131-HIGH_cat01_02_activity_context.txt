Below is one way to disambiguate the recurring activities by incorporating their context into the names. In our revised log we distinguish between the “initial” and “follow‐up” verifications, as well as between calls made for different purposes, and we also slightly modify the “initiate” events to reflect the channel (online vs. walk-in). For example, when documents are verified the first time the activity is renamed to reflect that it is an initial check; when documents are verified after additional information is received or after an account adjustment, the name indicates a reverification. Similarly, calls to customers are renamed to indicate whether they are seeking missing documentation, clarifying discrepancies, or recalling a customer who left the premises.

### Justification of Naming Choices

1. **Initiate Request vs. Submission/Initiation:**  
   - *Online Request Submission* is used when the request is submitted via the online portal (Cases C001 and C002), while *Walk-In Request Initiation* clearly indicates that the request was made in person at a branch (Case C003).

2. **Document Verification:**  
   - The first occurrence is renamed *Initial Document Verification (Online)* or *In-Person Document Verification* depending on the context and resource involved.  
   - The second occurrence is renamed *Reverification of Submitted Documents* or *Reverification of Documents Post-Adjustment* to denote that it is a follow-up verification after additional documentation is received or after an internal adjustment.

3. **Call Customer:**  
   - In C001, the call is specifically to request missing documents, hence *Call for Missing Documents*.  
   - In C002, the first call addresses an account discrepancy (*Call for Account Clarification*), while the subsequent call confirms that adjustments have been made (*Follow-Up Call for Adjustment Confirmation*).  
   - In C003, the call is made to recall a customer who left the branch (*Call to Request Customer Return*).

4. **Adjust Account:**  
   - In C002, the activity is renamed *Internal Account Adjustment* to reflect a standard correction after an account clarification call.  
   - In C003, it is termed *Internal Account Correction* to highlight that the adjustment is made in response to missing or incomplete information.

5. **Approve Request:**  
   - The approval step is uniform across all cases and has been renamed *Final Approval* to emphasize that it is the conclusive step in the process.

This approach clarifies each activity’s role and context within the overall workflow, reducing ambiguity when the same base activity (like “Verify Documents” or “Call Customer”) occurs more than once with different purposes.
