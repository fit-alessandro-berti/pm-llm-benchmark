## Analysis of Anomalies and Hypotheses

Here's a breakdown of the anomalies, potential reasons for their existence, and how to verify them with SQL queries:

**1. Anomaly: Evaluation/Approval Loop**

* **Description:** The model allows for a claim to be evaluated and approved multiple times, creating a loop.
* **Hypotheses:**
    * **Changing Business Rules:**  The company might have previously required multiple rounds of evaluation and approval, but this requirement was later relaxed or changed without updating the model.
    * **Error in Process Modeling:** The modeler might have mistakenly introduced the loop, intending to represent iterative reviews in a more complex way.
    * **Workflow System Error:**  A bug in the workflow system could be causing the evaluation and approval steps to be repeated unintentionally.

* **Verification Queries:**

```sql
-- Find claims with multiple approval events
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS approval_count
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P' -- Approve Claim
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Find claims with multiple evaluation events followed by approval events
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS eval_approve_sequence_count
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2 AND string_agg(activity, '') LIKE '%E%P%';
```

**2. Anomaly: Optional Customer Notification (XOR)**

* **Description:** The model allows the customer notification step to be skipped.
* **Hypotheses:**
    * **Business Rule Exception:** There might be certain claim types or situations where customer notification is not required (e.g., very small claims, automatic approvals).
    * **Incomplete Process:**  The model might not fully represent the notification process, assuming it happens outside the tracked workflow.
    * **Human Error:** Adjusters might be occasionally forgetting or intentionally skipping the notification step.

* **Verification Queries:**

```sql
-- Find claims without a notification event
SELECT claim_id
FROM claims
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE claim_events.claim_id = claims.claim_id
    AND activity = 'N' -- Notify Customer
);

-- Calculate the percentage of claims without notification
SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN notification_exists = FALSE THEN 1 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*) AS percentage_without_notification
FROM (
    SELECT claim_id, EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM claim_events
        WHERE claim_events.claim_id = claims.claim_id
        AND activity = 'N'
    ) AS notification_exists
    FROM claims
) AS notification_check;

```

**3. Anomaly: Premature Claim Closure**

* **Description:** The partial ordering allows the claim to be closed before the evaluation and even before the loop (containing evaluate/approve) completes.
* **Hypotheses:**
    * **Modeling Error:** The partial order was incorrectly defined, not capturing the necessary precedence relationships.
    * **Workflow System Flexibility:** The system might allow for flexible execution, enabling users to close claims even if some tasks are pending or delegated.  This could be intentional for certain scenarios (e.g., duplicates, withdrawals).
    * **Data Entry Errors:** The timestamps in the `claim_events` table might be inaccurate, making it appear that claims were closed prematurely.


* **Verification Queries:**

```sql
-- Find claims closed before evaluation
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'C'  -- Close Claim
AND timestamp < (
    SELECT MIN(timestamp)
    FROM claim_events ce2
    WHERE ce2.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
    AND ce2.activity = 'E' -- Evaluate Claim
);


-- Find claims closed before any approval (if there are any approvals)
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events ce1
WHERE activity = 'C'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events ce2
    WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
    AND ce2.activity = 'P' -- Approve Claim
    AND ce2.timestamp < ce1.timestamp
);
```


These queries will provide evidence to support or refute the hypotheses, leading to a better understanding of the actual process execution and potential improvements to the model or the underlying workflow. They can be refined further based on specific business knowledge and the results of initial investigations. For instance, focusing on specific claim types or adjusters, or analyzing the "additional_info" column in `claim_events` for relevant details related to skipping notifications or closing prematurely.
