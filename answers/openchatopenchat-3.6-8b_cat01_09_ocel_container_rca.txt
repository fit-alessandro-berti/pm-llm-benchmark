Based on the provided data, the following root causes for the performance issues in the process can be identified:

1. High frequency of "Load Truck" events (8559) with a long duration (5259.71), which may indicate inefficiencies in the truck loading process. Improving the loading process could potentially reduce the overall duration and improve resource utilization.
2. High frequency of "Drive to Terminal" events (1989) with a long duration (10999.07) and long turnaround time ("Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" with 1988 events and duration (84119.09)). This indicates that the trucks spend a significant amount of time traveling to and from the terminal. Optimizing the transport route or increasing the efficiency of the terminal operations might help reduce this duration.
3. High frequency of "Load to Vehicle" events (1827) with a long duration (1960.59) and the need to repeatedly reload vehicles ("Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" with 1827 events), which may point to inefficiencies in the loading or unloading process. Redesigning the loading or unloading process to minimize the need for multiple reloads could help.
4. The "Book Vehicles" event has a high frequency (585) and long duration (295965.56), indicating that booking vehicles takes a significant amount of time. Streamlining the vehicle booking process or optimizing resource allocation could help reduce this duration.
5. The "Reschedule Container" event has a high frequency (36) and long duration (7110.06), which may indicate that rescheduling containers is a time-consuming process. Identifying the reasons for rescheduling and implementing measures to prevent or minimize it could help improve performance.
6. The "Place in Stock" event has a high frequency (1794) and long duration (743380.51), indicating that placing containers in stock takes a significant amount of time. Optimizing the stock placement process or increasing the stock capacity could help reduce this duration.

These issues highlight the need for process optimization and resource allocation improvements, possibly through analyzing the process in more detail, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing targeted solutions.
