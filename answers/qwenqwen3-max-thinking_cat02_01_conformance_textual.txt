Based on the normative process description and the provided event log, we analyze each case to determine whether it conforms to the expected behavior. The key principles derived from the description are:

### Core Rules (from the normative description):
1. **"Receive order"** must be the first activity.
2. **"Check inventory"** must occur immediately after "Receive order" and before any other activity (especially before "Authorize payment", "Package items", or "Cancel order").
3. If inventory is **sufficient**:
   - The sequence must be:  
     **Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order**
   - **"Authorize payment" must precede "Package items"**
   - **"Package items" must precede "Ship order"**
4. If inventory is **insufficient**:
   - The sequence must be:  
     **Receive  Check  Cancel order  Close order**
   - **No fulfillment-related activities** ("Authorize payment", "Package items", "Ship order") should occur after cancellation—or at all in this branch.
5. **"Close order" must be the final activity** in all cases.
6. **"Ship order" must never occur after "Cancel order"**.
7. **"Authorize payment" should only occur if inventory is sufficient**, and thus **must not appear in the cancellation path**.

Now, evaluate each case:

---

### **Case 1**
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close

 **Compliant**  
- Follows the full successful path exactly as described for sufficient inventory.
- All ordering constraints are satisfied.

---

### **Case 2**
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  **Package  Authorize**  Ship  Close

 **Violation**  
- **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**, which violates the rule:  
  > “Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging”  
  and  
  > “Package items should only occur after authorization”.

- This implies items were prepared for shipment before payment was confirmed—contrary to the normative process.

---

### **Case 3**
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel**  **Ship**  Close

 **Multiple Violations**  
1. **"Authorize payment" is followed by "Cancel order"**:  
   - According to the normative description, cancellation should occur **immediately after "Check inventory"** if stock is insufficient.  
   - Authorizing payment implies inventory was deemed sufficient, making cancellation inconsistent.  
   - The description states: *“If inventory is insufficient  Cancel directly after Check”*.  
   - Thus, **"Authorize payment" should not appear in a cancellation path**.

2. **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"**:  
   - Explicitly forbidden:  
     > “It would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping) after cancellation”  
     and  
     > “Ship order should never occur after a cancellation.”

This case violates both the logical branching condition and the prohibition on post-cancellation fulfillment steps.

---

### **Case 4**
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close

 **Compliant**  
- Matches the expected cancellation path exactly.
- No fulfillment activities appear.
- "Close order" is final.

---

### **Case 5**
Sequence:  
Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship**  Close  
*(Missing "Package items")*

 **Violation**  
- **"Ship order" occurs without "Package items"**.
- The normative description states:  
  > “Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'”

- Therefore, **"Package items" is a mandatory step between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order"** in the sufficient-inventory path.
- Skipping packaging violates the required sequence.

---

### Summary of Violations:

| Case ID | Violation(s) |
|--------|--------------|
| **1** |  No violation |
| **2** |  "Package items" before "Authorize payment" |
| **3** |  "Authorize payment" in cancellation path; "Ship order" after "Cancel order" |
| **4** |  No violation |
| **5** |  "Ship order" without prior "Package items" |

### Final Answer:

**Cases that violate the normative process: 2, 3, and 5.**

**Explanations:**
- **Case 2**: Packaging occurred before payment authorization, which contradicts the requirement that payment must be authorized before items are prepared for shipment.
- **Case 3**: Payment was authorized (implying sufficient inventory), yet the order was later canceled; furthermore, shipping occurred after cancellation, which is explicitly prohibited.
- **Case 5**: The order was shipped without the required "Package items" step, violating the mandatory sequence between payment authorization and shipping.
