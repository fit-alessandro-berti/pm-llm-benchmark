Based on the provided event logs for various object types in a supply chain context, I can outline the general processes involved:

1. **Customer Order**: The process starts with a customer order being registered.

2. **Transport Document**: Once the customer order is registered, a transport document is created. This document typically outlines details such as cargo description, destination, and mode of transportation.

3. **Vehicle Booking and Container Management**: After the transport document is created, vehicles are booked for transportation. Simultaneously, empty containers may be ordered to pack the goods.

4. **Departure and Rescheduling**: Once all preparations are complete, the shipment departs for its destination. However, there might be instances where a container needs to be rescheduled due to unforeseen circumstances such as delays or changes in demand.

These processes represent a high-level overview of the supply chain operations involved in fulfilling customer orders and transporting goods.
