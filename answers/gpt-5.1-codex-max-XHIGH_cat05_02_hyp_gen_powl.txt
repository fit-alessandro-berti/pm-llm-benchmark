Here are the key points that stand out in the provided POWL model, why they might exist, and how you could look for evidence of them in your event data:

**Anomalies in the model**

- The loop between E (Evaluate) and P (Approve) allows repeated cycles of evaluation and approval without an explicit exit condition, so you may see multiple E/P pairs per claim.
- The XOR between N (Notify Customer) and a skip transition means notification can be omitted entirely.
- The partial order allows C (Close) after A (Assign Adjuster) without enforcing completion of the loop or the notification, so closing can occur before evaluation/approval and before notifying the customer. The missing order from the XOR to C also makes closing concurrent with notification.

**Possible reasons these structures exist**

- A change in policy that introduced reevaluation/approval loops for contested claims, only partially reflected in the model.
- A design decision to allow silent skips of notification in exceptional cases (e.g., withdrawn claims), but not fully constrained.
- Miscommunication between process designers and implementers about when a claim may be closed (e.g., early closure for incomplete submissions).
- Tooling limitations or configuration errors that failed to encode the intended dependencies.

**How to verify in the database**

Using `claim_events` (with `activity` values R/A/E/P/N/C) keyed by `claim_id` and `timestamp`, you can look for patterns that match the above:

- Claims closed without evaluation/approval: per `claim_id`, check for a C event where no E or P exists, or where the C timestamp precedes all E/P timestamps.
- Multiple approvals or evaluations: count E and P events per claim; flag claims with more than one P or unexpected EPE patterns.
- Skipped notifications: find claims with a C event but no N event; or measure the proportion of claims lacking N.
- Premature closure: identify claims where C occurs before the first E or P in time.
- Concurrency/ordering issues: check cases where C occurs before N, or where N is missing but the claim was otherwise processed.
