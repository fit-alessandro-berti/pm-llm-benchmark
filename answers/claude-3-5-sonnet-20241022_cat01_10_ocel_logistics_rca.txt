Based on the directly-follows graphs provided, here are the key process and data-specific performance issues:

1. Payment-related delays:
- Very long duration (452,919 seconds  5.2 days) between "package delivered" and "pay order" for items
- Extremely long duration (1,127,921 seconds  13 days) between "package delivered" and "payment reminder" for items
- Long duration (528,039 seconds  6.1 days) between "confirm order" and "pay order" for orders

2. Stock-related issues:
- Long cycle involving "item out of stock" -> "reorder item" -> "pick item" (total duration over 700,000 seconds  8.1 days)
- High frequency of stock-related loops among employees (900+ occurrences of pick item -> item out of stock -> reorder item -> pick item)

3. Order handling inefficiencies:
- Significant delay (150,267 seconds  1.7 days) between "confirm order" and "pick item" for items
- Long duration (161,040 seconds  1.9 days) between "confirm order" and "create package" for items
- Multiple back-and-forth movements between "place order" and "confirm order" for customers (1,480 occurrences)

4. Package handling bottlenecks:
- Long duration (68,600 seconds  19 hours) between "create package" and "send package" for items
- Significant delay (66,417 seconds  18.4 hours) between "send package" and "package delivered" for items
- High frequency of package-related activities being repeated among employees

5. Employee workflow patterns:
- High frequency of repeated "pick item" activities by employees (4,545 occurrences)
- Frequent switching between different activities by employees, indicating possible multitasking or inefficient task allocation

6. Product-related cycles:
- Multiple short cycles in product handling, indicating possible rework or inefficient processing
- Frequent transitions between different states for the same products

These issues suggest problems with payment collection, inventory management, order processing efficiency, and resource allocation in the process.
