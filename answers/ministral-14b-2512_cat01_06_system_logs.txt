### **Explanation of Case Grouping & Activity Naming Logic**

#### **1. Case Identification (Grouping Events into Cases)**
- **Case_1** represents a **multi-tasking work session** where the user:
  - Drafted a new document (`Document1.docx`),
  - Handled an email (`Annual Meeting`),
  - Reviewed a PDF (`Report_Draft.pdf`),
  - Updated a budget (`Budget_2024.xlsx`),
  - Referenced the budget in the document before closing it.
  - The **temporal and contextual continuity** (e.g., switching between apps while working on the same document) suggests this is a single logical "case" of **document preparation with supporting tasks**.

- **Case_2** is a **separate work session** focused solely on drafting the **Quarterly Report** (`Quarterly_Report.docx`). The user opened, wrote, saved, and closed this document independently of `Case_1`, indicating a distinct process instance.

**Key Grouping Rules:**
- **Document/Email Focus:** Events tied to the same document/email (e.g., `Document1.docx`) are grouped unless a clear break (e.g., closing the document) occurs.
- **Temporal Proximity:** Events within ~1-2 minutes of each other (e.g., typing + saving in Word) are part of the same activity.
- **Application Switches:** Switches between apps (e.g., Word  Chrome  Excel) are treated as **sub-activities** within the same case if they serve the same high-level goal (e.g., preparing `Document1.docx`).

---

#### **2. Activity Naming (Standardization)**
- **Low-level actions** (e.g., `FOCUS`, `TYPING`, `CLICK`) were mapped to **high-level activities** that reflect the user’s intent:
  - `FOCUS`  `Start Document Drafting`, `Open Email`, `Open PDF`, etc.
  - `TYPING`  `Write Document Content`, `Write Email Content`, `Update Budget Data`.
  - `SAVE`  `Save Document`, `Save Budget`, etc.
  - `SWITCH`  `Switch to [Next Task]` (e.g., `Switch to Email Handling`).
- **Contextual Clues:** The `Window` attribute (e.g., `Document1.docx`) helped disambiguate activities (e.g., typing in Word vs. Excel).
- **Derived Activities:** Some events (e.g., `Highlight PDF Content`) were kept as-is since they are already meaningful.

---
#### **3. Additional Attributes**
- **Application:** Helps distinguish between tools used (e.g., Word vs. Excel).
- **Document/Email:** Links events to the specific artifact being worked on.
- **Additional Details:** Captures key actions (e.g., "Draft intro paragraph") for richer analysis.

---
#### **4. Coherent Narrative**
The event log tells the story of:
1. **Case_1:** A **document preparation workflow** interleaved with email and budget updates.
   - The user starts drafting a document, gets distracted by an email, reviews a PDF, updates a budget, and finally references the budget in the document before closing it.
2. **Case_2:** A **focused report-writing session** with minimal interruptions.
   - The user opens a template, writes an executive summary, saves, and closes the report.

This structure allows process mining to:
- Identify **common patterns** (e.g., how often users switch between tasks).
- Detect **bottlenecks** (e.g., time spent on emails vs. writing).
- Optimize workflows (e.g., reducing context-switching).

---
#### **5. Assumptions & Limitations**
- **Ambiguity in Case Boundaries:** If the user had reopened `Document1.docx` after a longer break (e.g., 30+ minutes), it might warrant a new case. Here, the 1-minute gap between `Case_1` and `Case_2` suggests a clear separation.
- **Email Handling:** Treated as a sub-task of `Case_1` since it was tied to the same document’s preparation. In other contexts, emails might be separate cases.
- **PDF Review:** Grouped with `Case_1` because it logically supported the document’s content. If the PDF were unrelated, it could be a new case.

This log is now ready for analysis in tools like **Disco** (for discovery) or **Celonis** (for conformance checking). Would you like any refinements (e.g., additional attributes, alternative case groupings)?
