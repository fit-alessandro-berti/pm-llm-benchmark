### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

#### Using Event Log Data and Process Mining Techniques

To identify and quantify the impact of instance-spanning constraints, we will leverage process mining techniques such as **conformance checking**, **process discovery**, and **performance analysis**. Specifically:

1. **Conformance Checking**: Verify that the actual process execution conforms to predefined process models. Identify deviations and their frequency.
2. **Process Discovery**: Extract a process model from the event log to visualize the typical flow and identify bottlenecks.
3. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze metrics like cycle times, waiting times, and resource utilization to understand the impact of constraints.

#### Metrics to Measure Impact

1. **Waiting Time Due to Resource Contention at Cold-Packing**:
   - **Metric**: Average waiting time for an order at cold-packing stations.
   - **Calculation**: Compare the time an order enters the queue for cold-packing with the time it starts processing.
   
2. **Waiting Time for Batch Completion**:
   - **Metric**: Average delay due to batch formation.
   - **Calculation**: Calculate the difference between when an order completes its final activity and when it is actually shipped.
   
3. **Delays Caused to Standard Orders by Express Orders**:
   - **Metric**: Delay introduced by express orders.
   - **Calculation**: Measure the additional time taken for standard orders due to express orders jumping the queue.
   
4. **Throughput Reduction Due to Hazardous Material Limits**:
   - **Metric**: Throughput reduction due to hazardous material limits.
   - **Calculation**: Track the number of orders processed per unit time before and after hitting the hazardous material limit.

#### Differentiating Waiting Time Factors

- **Within-Instance Factors**: Long activity durations, inefficiencies in individual tasks.
- **Between-Instance Factors**: Queuing for shared resources, waiting for batches to form, interruptions due to higher-priority orders.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

#### Potential Interactions Between Constraints

1. **Express Orders and Cold-Packing**:
   - If an express order needs cold-packing, it might jump the queue, causing longer waits for standard orders needing the same resource.

2. **Batching and Hazardous Material Limits**:
   - If multiple hazardous orders are batched together, this could lead to bottlenecks at the packing and quality check stages due to the limit on simultaneous hazardous material processing.

#### Importance of Understanding Interactions

Understanding these interactions is crucial because it helps in designing strategies that address the root causes rather than just symptoms. For instance, a poorly timed batch formation could exacerbate issues with hazardous material limits, leading to further delays.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation Policies for Shared Stations

- **Primary Constraint**: Shared Cold-Packing Stations
- **Changes Proposed**: Implement a dynamic allocation system where cold-packing stations are assigned based on real-time demand.
- **Leveraging Data**: Use historical data to predict demand spikes and allocate resources accordingly.
- **Expected Outcomes**: Reduced waiting times for both express and standard orders needing cold-packing.

#### Strategy 2: Revised Batching Logic (Dynamic Batch Formation Triggers)

- **Primary Constraint**: Shipping Batches
- **Changes Proposed**: Adjust batch formation criteria dynamically based on current resource availability and order types.
- **Leveraging Data**: Analyze historical batch sizes and resource utilization patterns to optimize batch formation.
- **Expected Outcomes**: Faster batch formation and reduced waiting times for orders.

#### Strategy 3: Improved Scheduling Rules Considering Priorities and Regulatory Limits

- **Primary Constraints**: Priority Handling, Hazardous Material Limits
- **Changes Proposed**: Develop a sophisticated scheduling algorithm that prioritizes express orders and manages hazardous material limits efficiently.
- **Leveraging Data**: Use predictive analytics to anticipate the need for hazardous material processing slots and schedule accordingly.
- **Expected Outcomes**: Better adherence to delivery deadlines and compliance with regulatory requirements.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

#### Simulation Techniques

- **Modeling Resource Contention**: Simulate the queuing behavior for cold-packing stations.
- **Batch Formation Delays**: Model the impact of different batch formation triggers.
- **Priority Interruptions**: Simulate how express orders affect the workflow.
- **Regulatory Limits**: Ensure simulations respect hazardous material limits.

#### Specific Aspects to Focus On

- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor how well resources are utilized under different scenarios.
- **Queue Lengths**: Track queue lengths for critical resources.
- **Delivery Times**: Evaluate the end-to-end time for orders.
- **Compliance**: Ensure regulatory limits are not violated.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

#### Key Metrics and Dashboards

1. **Average Waiting Time at Cold-Packing Stations**:
   - **Dashboard**: Real-time queue length and average wait time visualization.
   
2. **Batch Formation Efficiency**:
   - **Dashboard**: Timeline showing batch formation and shipment.
   
3. **Adherence to Delivery Deadlines**:
   - **Dashboard**: Percentage of orders delivered within promised timelines.
   
4. **Compliance with Hazardous Material Limits**:
   - **Dashboard**: Number of hazardous orders processed at any given time.

#### Tracking Effectiveness

- **Queue Lengths**: Monitor queue lengths to ensure dynamic resource allocation is effective.
- **Batch Formation**: Track batch formation efficiency to validate revised batching logic.
- **Compliance**: Ensure hazardous material limits are respected while maintaining throughput.

By following these steps and leveraging process mining techniques, the fulfillment center can significantly improve its operational efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.
