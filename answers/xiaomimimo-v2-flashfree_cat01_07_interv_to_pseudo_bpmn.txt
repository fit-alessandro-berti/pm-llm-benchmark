Based on the interview transcripts, here is a structured textual description of the BPMN process model. This model consolidates the perspectives of all stakeholders into a coherent workflow, highlighting the standard flow, decision points, roles, and exception handling.

### **Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

#### **1. Roles (Pools/Lanes)**
*   **Accounts Payable (AP):** Clerk (Mary) & Supervisor (Rita)
*   **Purchasing:** Officer (Dan)
*   **Department Management:** Manager (Carlos)
*   **Supplier Relationship Management:** Manager (Karen)
*   **Supplier:** External Entity

---

#### **2. Sequence Flow & Activities**

**Start Event:** Invoice Received (by Email)

**1. Initial Validation (AP Clerk - Mary)**
*   **Task:** Check for valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
*   **Gateway 1 (PO Validation):** Is a PO number present and valid?
    *   **No:** 
        *   **Task:** Send invoice back to Supplier requesting details.
        *   **Flow:** Returns to Start (Wait for revised invoice).
    *   **Yes:** Proceed to next step.

**2. Logging & Receipt Confirmation (AP Clerk - Mary)**
*   **Task:** Log invoice into Accounting System.
*   **Task:** Forward to Purchasing Department.
*   **Task:** (Purchasing) Check if goods/services were actually received (Receipt Confirmation).
*   **Output Data Object:** Confirmed Receipt.

**3. Matching & Verification (Purchasing Officer - Dan)**
*   **Task:** Match invoice line items (quantities, prices, delivery charges) against the PO.
*   **Gateway 2 (Matching):** Does the invoice match the PO exactly?
    *   **Yes:** 
        *   **Task:** Send confirmation email to Accounts Payable.
    *   **No (Discrepancy):**
        *   **Gateway 3 (Discrepancy Type):** What is the issue?
            *   *Case A: Missing Information (e.g., PO number missing or unclear):*
                *   **Task:** Notify AP Clerk (Mary) to request information.
                *   **Flow:** Returns to Task 1 (Wait for info).
            *   *Case B: Billing Error (e.g., extra units, wrong price):*
                *   **Task:** Contact Supplier directly OR ask AP to hold for corrected invoice.
                *   **Flow:** Returns to Task 1 (Wait for correction).
            *   *Case C: Complex/Unresolvable Issue:*
                *   **Task:** Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita).
                *   **Flow:** Go to Exception Handling (Section 4).

**4. Manager Approval (Department Manager - Carlos)**
*   **Trigger:** System notification sent after Purchasing confirmation and matching.
*   **Task:** Review invoice, PO, and confirmation details.
*   **Gateway 4 (Approval):** Does the Manager approve?
    *   **Yes:** 
        *   **Task:** Click "Approve" in System.
        *   **Flow:** Proceed to Payment Scheduling.
    *   **No (Reject/Investigate):**
        *   **Task:** Reject or Request AP to hold and investigate (e.g., budget discrepancies).
        *   **Flow:** Returns to Task 1 (Investigation/Wait).

**5. Payment Scheduling (AP Clerk - Mary)**
*   **Task:** Add approved invoice to the next payment run.
*   **End Event:** Payment Processed.

---

#### **3. Exception Handling & Variations (AP Supervisor - Rita & Supplier Manager - Karen)**

This sub-process runs parallel to the main flow or is triggered by Gateway 3 (Escalation).

*   **Trigger:** Invoice cannot be matched, missing PO, or unresolvable discrepancy.
*   **Task (Rita):** Investigate exception / Coordinate between departments.
*   **Gateway 5 (Retrospective PO):** Is this an informal contract/service requiring a retrospective PO?
    *   **Yes:**
        *   **Task (Rita):** Work with Department Head to create retrospective PO.
        *   **Flow:** Return to Main Flow (Task 2: Logging).
    *   **No:**
        *   **Task (Rita/Karen):** Contact Supplier (via Supplier Relationship Manager) to resolve.
            *   *Supplier Action:* Provide missing info or send revised invoice.
        *   **Flow:** Return to Main Flow (Task 2: Logging).

---

#### **4. Ambiguities and Notes**
*   **Re-Entry:** The process is circular for corrections; after any exception resolution (by Rita or Dan), the invoice generally re-enters the flow at the **Logging** or **Matching** stage to ensure the system record is updated.
*   **Notifications:** Carlos mentions receiving a "notification" which implies a system automation (e.g., email trigger) after Dan's confirmation, rather than a manual hand-off.
*   **Supplier Interaction:** Karen indicates she might contact the supplier directly for discrepancies, acting as an intermediary, whereas Dan suggests he might contact them directly as well. The model suggests this is flexible depending on the severity/relationship.
