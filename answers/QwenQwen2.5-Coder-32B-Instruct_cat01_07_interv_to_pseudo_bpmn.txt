### BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

#### **Activities/Tasks:**
1. **Receive Invoice:** An invoice arrives, typically via email.
2. **Check Purchase Order (PO) Number:** Verify if the invoice is associated with a valid PO number.
3. **Request More Details:** Send an email to the supplier for missing details (no PO number).
4. **Log Invoice:** Enter the invoice details into the accounting system.
5. **Forward to Purchasing Department:** Send the logged invoice to the purchasing officer for confirmation of goods or services received.
6. **Confirm Receipt:** Purchasing officer checks if the invoice details match the PO.
7. **Request Correction:** Contact the supplier directly or ask Accounts Payable to hold the invoice for correction if discrepancies are found.
8. **Resolve Discrepancies:** Resolve discrepancies between invoice and PO (clarification with Purchasing or escalation to Supervisor).
9. **Escalate to Supervisor:** Escalate unresolved discrepancies to the Accounts Payable Supervisor.
10. **Match Invoice to PO:** Ensure the invoice line items match the PO in the system.
11. **Send for Department Manager Approval:** Await the manager’s approval after confirming receipt and matching with PO.
12. **Process Manager Approval:** Manager reviews and approves or rejects the invoice.
13. **Investigate Suspicious Invoices:** Investigate invoices flagged for discrepancies by the manager.
14. **Handle Exceptions:** Supervisor resolves issues with missing POs, discrepancies, or no matching POs.
15. **Schedule Payment:** Once approved, schedule the invoice for payment.

#### **Sequence Flow:**
1. **Receive Invoice**  (If no PO number, **Request More Details**)  *Purchasing Officer*
2. **Receive Invoice**  (If PO number, **Log Invoice**)  **Forward to Purchasing Department**  **Confirm Receipt**
3. **Confirm Receipt**  (If discrepancy, **Request Correction**)  **Accounts Payable**  *Supplier*
4. **Resolve Discrepancies**  (If unresolved, **Escalate to Supervisor**)  *Supervisor*
5. **Match Invoice to PO**  (If all matches, **Send for Department Manager Approval**)  *Department Manager*
6. **Process Manager Approval**  (If approved, **Schedule Payment**)  *Accounts Payable*
7. **Process Manager Approval**  (If rejected, **Investigate Suspicious Invoices**)  **Request Correction**  **Resolve Discrepancies** [Back to **Resolve Discrepancies**]
8. **Handle Exceptions**  (If resolved, return to **Confirm Receipt**)

#### **Gateways/Decision Points:**
1. **Check PO Number:** [Exclusive Gateway] If PO number is missing  **Request More Details**; If PO number is present  **Log Invoice**
2. **Confirm Receipt:** [Exclusive Gateway] If discrepancy found  **Request Correction**; If no discrepancy  **Match Invoice to PO**
3. **Resolve Discrepancies:** [Exclusive Gateway] If discrepancy is resolved  **Send for Department Manager Approval**; If not resolved  **Escalate to Supervisor**
4. **Process Manager Approval:** [Inclusive Gateway] If approved  **Schedule Payment**; If rejected  **Investigate Suspicious Invoices**
5. **Load Exceptions:** [Exclusive Gateway] If issue is resolved  **Confirm Receipt**; If not resolved  [Repeat tasks within Exceptions loop]

#### **Roles/Participants:**
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**
2. **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
3. **Department Manager (Carlos)**
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**
6. **Suppliers**
7. **Accounts Payable Systems**

#### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
1. **Input:** Invoice (email attachment or document)
2. **Input:** Purchase Order (document in the system)
3. **Output:** Confirmed Invoice Details (document in the system)
4. **Output:** Confirmation Email from Purchasing
5. **Output:** Notification to Department Manager (email or system notification)
6. **Output:** Manager's Approval/Rejection (system notification)
7. **Output:** Scheduled Payment (data in the accounting system)

#### **Exceptions/Variations:**
1. **No PO Number:** Invoice sent back with request for more details until received.
2. **Discrepancy in Invoice:** Clarification requested from Purchasing; escalation to Supervisor if unresolved.
3. **Mismatch in Line Items:** Clarification from Purchasing; escalation to Supervisor if unresolved.
4. **Suspicious Total Amount:** Investigate further by Manager; notify Supplier or Purchasing if necessary.
5. **Retrospective PO Creation:** Supervisor creates a retrospective PO or decides on rejection for invoices without a matching PO.

### Notes:
- Uncertainty noted in tasks where multiple roles interact directly, such as discrepancies requiring confirmation or escalation.
- Inclusion of a loop for handling exceptions ensures unresolved issues do not stagnate.
- The system processes notifications are implied in the sequence flow, though the explicit use of automatic notifications is noted for Manager approval requests.
