1. The process starts with an "Employee" who submits a declaration.

2. After submission, the "Administration" or a "Pre-Approver" might approve it or reject it. If it's approved by either party, the next step is to have the "Supervisor" finalize the approval. The flow will then check if there are any missing documents (MISSING). If all is well, and the Supervisor finalizes the approval, a request for payment can be made and the payment is handled.

3. If the declaration is approved by the Administration, it could then go to the "Budget Owner" who might approve or reject it. Similar to step 2, if approved, the flow will move to Supervisor's final approval and then proceed with a request for payment.

4. If at any stage of the process, the declaration is rejected by either party (Supervisor, Employee, Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver), it can be resubmitted by the Employee and the entire process could start over again based on the rejection reasons.

5. In case of multiple rejections or submissions, the frequency and performance metrics provide insight into how often this occurs and the outcome (financial value) in these scenarios.
