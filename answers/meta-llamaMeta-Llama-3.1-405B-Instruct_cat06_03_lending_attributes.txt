Based on the provided attributes, the following appear to be sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen or not, which could be a sensitive attribute related to nationality or immigration status.
2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the individual's gender, which is a protected characteristic in many fairness and anti-discrimination frameworks.
3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute may indicate the individual's language proficiency or ethnicity, which could be a sensitive attribute related to cultural or linguistic background.

These attributes may be considered sensitive because they relate to personal characteristics that are protected by law or are considered important for fairness and anti-discrimination. The values of these attributes could potentially influence the outcome of the process, and it is essential to ensure that they do not unfairly impact the decisions made.

The other attributes, such as **activity**, **concept:name**, **resource**, **start_timestamp**, **time**, and **time:timestamp**, seem to be more related to the process itself and do not appear to be sensitive for fairness. However, it's essential to consider the specific context and domain to make a more informed judgment about which attributes might be sensitive.
