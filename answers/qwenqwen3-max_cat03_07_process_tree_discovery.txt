Based on the event log, we can observe the following behavior:

- Every case starts with **Receive Application (RA)**.
- This is followed by **Validate Form (VF)**.
- Then **Assess Eligibility (AE)** is performed.
- After AE, there are **two possibilities**:
  - **Either** the process proceeds directly to **Approval Decision (AD)** (as in Case 2),
  - **Or** it enters a **loop** where:
    - **Request Missing Info (RMI)** is executed (possibly **multiple times**, as in Case 3),
    - followed by **Validate Form (VF)** again,
    - and then it goes back to **Assess Eligibility (AE)** (implied by the fact that after re-validation, the process continues to AD without repeating AE explicitly — but since AE must precede the decision, we assume AE is re-executed or its result is re-evaluated; however, **AE does not appear again in the log**, so the loop likely goes **from RMI  VF  back to the decision point before AD**).

But crucially, **AE appears only once per case** in the logs. This suggests that **the loop does not re-execute AE**, but rather **after AE, there's a choice**: either proceed to AD, or request missing info and re-validate, and then **go back to the same decision point** (i.e., after re-validation, the system re-checks eligibility implicitly or proceeds to AD).

However, since **AE is not repeated**, the loop must occur **after AE**, and the re-validation is followed **directly by AD** (as seen in Cases 1 and 3: after the second VF, the next activity is AD).

Thus, the structure is:

1. **RA  VF  AE**
2. Then, **a loop** that allows **zero or more** occurrences of **RMI  VF**
3. Then **AD  SC  AC**

This matches all cases:
- Case 2: RA  VF  AE  (loop body 0 times)  AD  SC  AC
- Case 1: RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC
- Case 3: RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC

Note: In Case 3, **RMI appears twice in a row**, then VF. This suggests that **RMI can repeat**, and **VF comes after all RMI repetitions**. But looking closely:

> Case 3:
> - AE at 09:10
> - RMI at 09:25
> - RMI at 09:45
> - VF at 10:20

This implies that **multiple RMI can occur before a single VF**. So the loop body is not strictly "RMI  VF", but rather **a block where RMI can repeat, followed by VF**, and this whole block can repeat? But that doesn't fit, because VF only appears **once after the RMI block**.

Alternatively, the process allows **RMI to be repeated**, and **VF is executed once after all RMI are done**. But in process trees, we need to model allowed behavior.

However, note that **between AE and AD**, the subsequence is:
- Case 1: [RMI, VF]
- Case 3: [RMI, RMI, VF]

So the pattern is: **(RMI)* followed by VF**, and this whole pattern occurs **zero or more times**? But VF is already executed **before** AE. So the second VF is a **re-validation**.

But here's the key: **VF appears both before and after AE**. So the first VF is initial validation, then AE, then possibly more RMI and VF cycles.

But in the loop, **each cycle should end with VF**, and **RMI can occur one or more times before that VF**? However, process trees don't easily model "one or more RMI then VF" as a unit unless we use sequences and loops carefully.

But note: the simplest and most common interpretation in process mining for such logs is a **loop** where the body is **RMI  VF**, and this body can repeat. However, that would produce traces like:
- RMI  VF  RMI  VF  ...

But in Case 3, we have **RMI  RMI  VF**, which **violates** RMI  VF  RMI  VF, because there are two RMI in a row without an intermediate VF.

Wait — unless the second RMI is allowed **without an intermediate VF**, which suggests that **RMI can be repeated**, and **VF is only done once at the end**.

But that would mean the structure after AE is:
- (RMI)*  VF

And this whole thing can be **optional** (i.e., zero or one occurrence), because after that, we go to AD.

But in the log, **after AE**, we never see VF without preceding RMI, and we never see RMI after the final VF before AD.

So the pattern after AE is:
- **Optionally**: one or more RMI, then one VF

But note: **the VF after RMI is necessary** to proceed.

So the sub-process after AE is:
- **XOR** between:
  - **tau** (do nothing, go to AD)
  - **a sequence**: (RMI repeated one or more times)  VF

But process trees don't have a "one or more" operator directly. However, we can model "one or more RMI" as: **RMI  *(tau, RMI)** — but that's complex.

Alternatively, note that **RMI can be modeled as a loop by itself**, but the cleanest way given the operators is to use a **loop** at the higher level.

But observe: the **entire block** of (RMI  VF) can repeat, **but only if we allow RMI to be executed multiple times before VF**, which the log shows is possible.

However, in standard process tree discovery (e.g., Inductive Miner), such behavior is often abstracted as a **loop** with body **RMI**, and then **VF** is outside — but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, consider that **Request Missing Info** might be an activity that can be repeated, and **Validate Form** is always done **after any number of RMI**, as a single step.

But to keep the model simple and fit the log, the most accurate and simple process tree is:

- **Main sequence**: RA  VF  AE  [LOOP]  AD  SC  AC

Where **[LOOP]** is a **loop** that allows **zero or more repetitions** of a body that produces **RMI* VF**.

But since we can't easily express "RMI*" in a process tree without additional constructs, and given that in practice **multiple RMI followed by one VF** can be seen as **a single loop iteration consisting of (RMI  *(tau, RMI))  VF**, that becomes messy.

However, note an important point: **in Case 3, two RMI occur consecutively**. This implies that **RMI can be repeated without an intermediate VF**. Therefore, the loop should allow **RMI to repeat**, and **VF to occur once per "cycle"**, but the log shows only **one VF after multiple RMI**.

This suggests that the **VF is not part of the loop body**, but rather **after a block of RMI**.

But then how do we model it?

A better interpretation: **after AE, there is a choice**:
- Either go directly to AD,
- Or do **RMI**, and then **repeat the choice** (i.e., after RMI, you can do more RMI or do VF and then proceed).

But VF must occur before AD.

So perhaps:

After AE:
- **LOOP** where:
  - **A = RMI**
  - **B = X( RMI, VF )**

But that doesn't guarantee VF before exit.

The standard way to model "do RMI zero or more times, then VF" is not directly a loop in process trees.

But note: the **Inductive Miner** would likely produce a **loop** with body **RMI**, and then **VF** in sequence after the loop — but that would allow traces like RMI, RMI, VF (good), but also RMI, VF, RMI (bad, not in log). However, in our log, **VF never appears before the final RMI block**, and **no RMI appears after VF** in the loop section.

So actually, the behavior is: **(RMI)* VF**, and this whole thing is **optional** (can be skipped).

So we can model it as:

- **XOR** between:
  - **tau**
  - **( +(RMI, tau), VF )** — no, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, use a **loop** where the body is **RMI**, and then **VF** is after the loop, but the loop is **optional**.

But process tree loops are of the form ***(A, B)**, meaning: **A; (B; A)* or just A**.

We can set:
- **A = RMI**
- **B = tau**

Then ***(RMI, tau)** gives: RMI, or RMI  RMI, or RMI  RMI  RMI, etc. — i.e., **one or more RMI**.

But we need **zero or more RMI**, then **VF**.

So:
- First, an **XOR** between **tau** and ***(RMI, tau)**  this gives **zero or more RMI** (since XOR with tau allows skipping).
- Then **** with **VF**

But that would be: **( X(tau, *(RMI, tau)), VF )**

However, this forces **VF** to always occur, even when no RMI is done — but in the log, when there's no RMI (Case 2), there is **no second VF**. The only VF is the one **before AE**.

Ah! Critical point: **In Case 2, there is only one VF (before AE), and no VF after AE**.

In Cases 1 and 3, there is a **second VF after RMI**.

So **VF after AE only occurs if there was RMI**.

Therefore, the **VF after AE is part of the "correction" loop**, not a mandatory step.

So the structure after AE is:
- **Optionally**: do **RMI one or more times**, then **VF**

So the optional block is: **( *(RMI, tau), VF )** — but ***(RMI, tau)** gives **one or more RMI**, which is what we want (since if you enter the block, you must do at least one RMI, then VF).

And this block is **optional** (XOR with tau).

So after AE, we have: **X( tau, ( *(RMI, tau), VF ) )**

Then followed by AD  SC  AC.

Now, putting it all together:

The full process tree is:

```
->(
  'RA',
  ->(
    'VF',
    ->(
      'AE',
      ->(
        X(
          tau,
          ->(
            *( 'RMI', tau ),
            'VF'
          )
        ),
        ->(
          'AD',
          ->(
            'SC',
            'AC'
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

But wait — this has **two VF's**: one before AE, and one possibly after. That matches the log.

However, in the loop body, we used ***( 'RMI', tau )**, which means:
- Execute 'RMI'
- Then, either exit, or execute tau and then 'RMI' again.

Since tau is silent, this effectively allows **one or more 'RMI'**.

And this is wrapped in a sequence with 'VF', and the whole thing is optional via XOR with tau.

This model allows:
- RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC  (Case 2)
- RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC  (Case 1)
- RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC  (Case 3)

Perfect.

Now, to write it in the process tree syntax as requested (final structure only):

```
-> (
  'RA',
  -> (
    'VF',
    -> (
      'AE',
      -> (
        X (
          tau,
          -> (
            * ( 'RMI', tau ),
            'VF'
          )
        ),
        -> (
          'AD',
          -> (
            'SC',
            'AC'
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

This is a valid process tree that captures the observed behavior with good fitness, precision, and simplicity.
