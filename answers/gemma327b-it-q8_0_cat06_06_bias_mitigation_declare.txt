# Explanation of added constraints:

# 1. Existence of ManualReview and BiasMitigationCheck: Ensures these activities are possible in the process.
# 2. Coexistence of ManualReview with decisions for minority applicants: If a decision (Approve or Reject) is made for a minority applicant, a ManualReview must also occur, ensuring a human oversight step.
# 3. Response: CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck: This ensures that when sensitive attributes are checked, a bias mitigation step is always performed.
# 4. Succession: BiasMitigationCheck must precede Approve or Reject: This enforces that decisions are only made after a bias mitigation check has been completed.
# 5. Non-succession: CheckApplicantRace cannot directly precede Reject: This prevents a direct biased outcome where a decision is made immediately after checking a sensitive attribute without any intervening mitigation step.
```

**Explanation of how these constraints reduce bias:**

The added constraints aim to introduce fairness and accountability into the loan application process. By requiring a `ManualReview` when decisions are made for minority applicants, we ensure human oversight and reduce the risk of automated bias. The `BiasMitigationCheck` ensures that sensitive attributes are not directly linked to decisions without a dedicated step to address potential bias. The `non-succession` constraint prevents immediate biased outcomes, forcing a mitigation step before a decision is made. These constraints collectively promote a more equitable and transparent process, reducing the likelihood of discriminatory outcomes.
