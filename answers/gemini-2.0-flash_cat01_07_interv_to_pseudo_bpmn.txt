    *   **Gateway (PO Present?):**
        *   **Yes:** Proceed to Log Invoice.
        *   **No:** Return Invoice to Supplier (Mary) - Request PO details.  *(Exception Path)*

3.  **Log Invoice:** (Mary) - Log invoice into accounting system.

4.  **Forward to Purchasing:** (Mary) - Forward invoice to Purchasing Department.

5.  **Verify Invoice Details:** (Dan) - Compare invoice details with PO.

        *   **No:** Contact Supplier/Hold Invoice (Dan) - Request corrected invoice or clarification. *(Exception Path)*

6.  **Handle Discrepancy:** (Dan/Karen) - If invoice doesn't match PO, Purchasing Officer (Dan) and/or Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) contact the supplier to resolve the discrepancy.  This might involve the supplier providing a revised invoice.

    *   **Gateway (Discrepancy Resolved?):**
        *   **Yes:** Return to Verify Invoice Details (Dan) - with the corrected invoice.
        *   **No:** Escalate to Supervisor (Mary) - If discrepancy cannot be resolved by Purchasing. *(Exception Path)*

10. **Send for Manager Approval:** (System) - System automatically sends notification to Department Manager for approval.

11. **Manager Approval:** (Carlos) - Manager reviews invoice details, PO, and confirmation.

    *   **Gateway (Manager Approves?):**
        *   **Yes:** Approve Invoice (Carlos).
        *   **No:** Reject Invoice/Hold (Carlos) - If suspicious activity is detected. *(Exception Path)*

12. **Reject Invoice/Hold (Manager):** (Carlos) - Manager rejects the invoice or requests further investigation. This may involve communication with Accounts Payable. *(Exception Path)*

13. **Schedule Payment:** (Mary) - Accounts Payable schedules the approved invoice for payment.

**Note:**  The process flow includes several exception paths to handle discrepancies, missing information, and other issues that may arise during the invoice approval process.  The involvement of the Supplier Relationship Manager is triggered by discrepancies and missing PO information.  The Supervisor's involvement is triggered by unresolved discrepancies. The manager's rejection can lead to further investigation, potentially restarting parts of the process.
