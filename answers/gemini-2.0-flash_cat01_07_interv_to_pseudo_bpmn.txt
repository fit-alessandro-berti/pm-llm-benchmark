**Notes:**

*   The process includes exceptions and variations, such as missing PO numbers and invoice discrepancies.
*   The Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is involved indirectly in resolving discrepancies.
*   The Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) handles exceptions and ensures problem invoices are resolved.
*   There is a potential loop back to "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO" if a discrepancy is found, after initial confirmation from Purchasing.
*   Where there is ambiguity, the description clarifies the conditional flow based on the decision outcome.
*   The process flow captures the iterative steps required to resolve discrepancies and the involvement of different roles in that process.
