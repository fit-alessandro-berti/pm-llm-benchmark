We need to produce a list of targeted, open-ended questions. No code. Use proper formatting. Probably bullet list. Ensure no SQL. Provide thoughtful questions covering missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, exceptions, communication, tools, metrics, etc. Use plain text.

**Clarifying the Property‑Onboarding Process – Targeted Open‑Ended Questions**

1. **Initial Contact & Documentation**  
   *Can you walk me through the exact steps the regional office follows when a landlord first reaches out, and how you determine which documents are required versus optional?*  

2. **Document Verification & Exceptions**  
   *When a landlord’s paperwork is incomplete or outdated, what is the typical turnaround time for requesting updates, and how do you handle cases where the landlord cannot provide a particular document (e.g., missing compliance certificate)?*  

3. **Property Data Capture**  
   *What specific fields are entered into the central property database, and who is responsible for validating the accuracy of each data point (e.g., square footage, amenities, expected rent range)?*  

4. **Assignment of Property Manager**  
   *Could you describe the decision‑making framework you use to match a property manager to a new listing (e.g., workload thresholds, geographic zones, experience matrix)?*  
   *How are conflicts resolved if multiple managers meet the criteria?*  

5. **Introductory Landlord Meeting**  
   *What are the key agenda items covered during the introductory call/meeting, and how do you capture any special landlord requirements that arise from that conversation?*  

6. **Scheduling Photography & Inspection**  
   *What is the typical lead time between the landlord meeting and the on‑site visits by the photographer and inspector?*  
   *How do you coordinate these two activities—are they always done together, or can they be staggered?*  

7. **Inspection Findings & Remediation**  
   *When the inspector identifies issues, what is the escalation path for deciding whether the landlord or the company arranges repairs?*  
   *Do you have predefined thresholds (e.g., cost, safety severity) that trigger different remediation workflows?*  

8. **Marketing Creation & Pricing Model**  
   *How does the digital marketing team translate the inspection report and property data into the final listing content and pricing?*  
   *What market data sources feed into the internal pricing model, and who approves the final rent recommendation?*  

9. **Activation in Rental Portal**  
   *What checks are performed before a property is “activated” on the portal, and who signs off on each check (e.g., compliance, IT, finance)?*  

10. **Tenant Screening Process**  
    *Can you outline the end‑to‑end tenant screening workflow, including any decision points where a manager may intervene (e.g., credit score thresholds, employment verification)?*  
    *How do you handle situations where multiple qualified applicants are competing for the same unit?*  

11. **Lease Negotiation & Custom Clauses**  
    *What authority does the property manager have to negotiate lease terms or offer promotional discounts, and what approvals are required for deviations from standard lease language?*  

12. **Security Deposit & Move‑In Coordination**  
    *What steps are taken to collect and hold the security deposit, and how is the move‑in date communicated and confirmed with both landlord and tenant?*  

13. **Quality Checks & Internal Audits**  
    *What specific compliance, financial, and technical checks are performed after onboarding, and how frequently are they reviewed (e.g., one‑time audit vs. periodic review)?*  

14. **Exception Management**  
    *Could you provide examples of “special insurance” or “custom lease clause” exceptions you’ve encountered, and explain the process for evaluating and approving those exceptions?*  

15. **Stakeholder Communication & Tracking**  
    *What tools (email, CRM, project‑management software) are used to track communications across regional offices, landlords, managers, and support teams, and how is accountability ensured?*  

16. **Performance Metrics & Continuous Improvement**  
    *Which key performance indicators (KPIs) do you monitor to assess the efficiency and quality of the onboarding process, and how are insights fed back into process improvements?*  

17. **Timeline & Bottlenecks**  
    *On average, how long does it take from the landlord’s initial contact to the property becoming available for rent, and where do you typically see the biggest delays?*  

18. **Roles & Responsibility Clarification**  
    *Beyond the primary roles you mentioned (coordinator, manager, photographer, inspector, marketing, compliance, finance, IT), are there any auxiliary roles (e.g., legal counsel, contractor liaison) that get involved, and at what stage?*  

19. **Scalability & Regional Variations**  
    *Do you apply the same onboarding workflow across all cities, or are there regional adaptations (e.g., different regulatory requirements) that affect the process?*  

20. **Future Enhancements**  
    *If you could change or automate one part of the current onboarding process, which part would it be and why?*  

These questions are designed to surface missing details, clarify decision criteria, delineate responsibilities, verify sequencing and timing, and understand how exceptions and variations are managed throughout the property onboarding lifecycle.
