## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Reconstructing Actual Job Flow Using Process Mining

Using **Process Mining** techniques, particularly **Discovery** and **Conformance Checking**, we can reconstruct the **actual flow** of jobs through the shop floor by analyzing the MES event logs. Each job (Case ID) has a sequence of events indicating when it was released, started and completed tasks, queued at machines, and impacted by disruptions. Using tools like **ProM**, **Celonis**, or **Disco**, we can:

- **Extract process models** (e.g., Petri nets, BPMN) to visualize the flow of jobs across machines and tasks.
- Identify **deviations from planned routings** and **unplanned activities** (e.g., rework, expedited tasks).
- Reconstruct **resource-specific timelines** to understand machine and operator behavior.

---

### Key Metrics and Techniques

#### a. **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions**
- **Flow time** = Time from job release to completion.
- **Lead time** = Time from customer order to delivery (if order timestamps are available).
- **Makespan** = Total time taken to complete all jobs in a given period.
- Use **case duration analysis** and **statistical dashboards** to visualize distributions (mean, median, 95th percentile).

#### b. **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times)**
- Identify "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events for each activity.
- Calculate **queue time** = Task Start – Queue Entry.
- Use **bottleneck analysis** and **resource utilization dashboards** to detect machines with high average queue times.

#### c. **Resource Utilization**
- Classify time into:
  - **Productive time**: Task execution.
  - **Setup time**: Between "Setup Start" and "Setup End".
  - **Idle time**: Between last task end and next task start.
- Calculate **utilization rate** = (Productive + Setup time) / Total time.
- Use **resource-centric timelines** and **Gantt charts** to visualize.

#### d. **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**
- Use the "Previous job" note in setup events to map job transitions.
- Build a **setup time matrix** for each machine:
  - Rows: Previous job type/machine configuration.
  - Columns: Next job type/machine configuration.
  - Cell values: Average or median setup duration.
- Use **clustering** or **regression models** to predict setup durations based on job attributes (e.g., material, size).

#### e. **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**
- Compute **lateness** = Task End Time – Due Date.
- Use **KPI dashboards** to show:
  - % of jobs on time.
  - Average lateness.
  - Distribution of delays.
- Use **conformance checking** to compare planned vs. actual execution paths.

#### f. **Impact of Disruptions**
- Flag events like "Breakdown Start", "Priority Change", "Job Cancellation", etc.
- Use **process slicing** to compare performance before and after disruptions.
- Apply **root cause analysis** to identify:
  - Which machines are most frequently down.
  - How disruptions propagate through the shop floor.
  - How urgent jobs affect other job lateness.

---

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### Key Identified Inefficiencies

#### a. **Bottleneck Resources**
- Identify machines with:
  - High utilization.
  - Long queue times.
  - Frequent breakdowns.
- Use **bottleneck analysis** and **resource concurrency charts** to quantify impact on throughput.

#### b. **Poor Task Prioritization**
- High-priority jobs (e.g., "Urgent") may still be delayed due to FCFS rules.
- Use **variant analysis** to compare flow times of high vs. low priority jobs.
- Use **tardiness distribution by priority** to show inefficiencies.

#### c. **Suboptimal Sequencing Leading to High Setup Times**
- Jobs with similar attributes (material, size) are not sequenced together.
- Use **setup matrix** to show high setup durations between dissimilar jobs.
- Use **sequence mining** to identify common setup-heavy job transitions.

#### d. **Starvation of Downstream Resources**
- Identify cases where downstream machines are idle while upstream queues build up.
- Use **synchronization analysis** and **resource dependency graphs** to trace upstream delays.

#### e. **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels**
- High variability in task durations leads to erratic WIP levels.
- Use **WIP trend analysis** and **case overlap charts** to detect spikes and lags.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Root Causes

| Cause | Impact | Process Mining Insight |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| **Static dispatching rules (e.g., FCFS, EDD)** | Poor adaptability to disruptions, high tardiness | Variant analysis shows frequent path deviations |
| **Lack of real-time visibility** | Suboptimal decisions based on outdated queue states | Queue time analysis shows mismatch between predicted and actual wait times |
| **Inaccurate time estimates** | Unrealistic schedules, missed due dates | Conformance checking shows frequent schedule deviations |
| **Ineffective handling of sequence-dependent setups** | Excessive setup times, low throughput | Setup matrix shows high variability in setup times based on sequence |
| **Poor inter-work center coordination** | Downstream starvation, WIP build-up | Resource dependency graphs show unbalanced flows |
| **Inadequate disruption response** | Schedule collapse under breakdowns or hot jobs | Disruption slicing shows significant delays post-event |

### Differentiating Between Scheduling Logic and Capacity Issues

- Use **bottleneck analysis** to determine if delays are due to resource limitations (e.g., single high-utilization machine) or poor sequencing (e.g., long setups).
- Use **simulation replay** to test if changing dispatching logic alone improves KPIs.
- Use **capacity planning dashboards** to compare actual vs. theoretical capacity.

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

---

### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**

#### Core Logic
Replace static FCFS/EDD rules with **multi-criteria dynamic dispatching** that considers:

- **Remaining processing time**
- **Due date slack** (due date – current time – remaining processing time)
- **Job priority**
- **Downstream machine load**
- **Estimated setup time** (based on setup matrix)

#### How It Uses Process Mining
- Setup matrix derived from log analysis to estimate setup durations.
- Historical job flow data to estimate remaining processing time.
- Real-time queue data (via live log updates) to assess downstream load.

#### Addressed Pathologies
- Poor prioritization.
- Suboptimal sequencing.
- Downstream starvation.

#### Expected KPI Impact
- **Tardiness**: -30% to -50%
- **WIP**: -20% to -40%
- **Utilization**: +10% to +15% at bottlenecks

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Probabilistic Models**

#### Core Logic
Use historical data to build **probabilistic task duration models** and integrate **predictive maintenance insights**. Schedule jobs using:

- **Monte Carlo simulations** to estimate job completion probabilities.
- **Machine learning models** (e.g., random forests, LSTMs) to predict task durations based on:
  - Job attributes (material, complexity)
  - Operator ID
  - Time of day
- **Predictive breakdown models** to schedule maintenance proactively.

#### How It Uses Process Mining
- Extract task duration distributions per task, machine, operator.
- Identify breakdown-prone machines and failure patterns.

---

### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Intelligent Job Sequencing**

#### Core Logic
Use **setup matrix analysis** to:
- **Batch similar jobs** to minimize transitions.
- **Optimize job sequencing** at bottleneck machines using:
  - **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** heuristics.
  - **Genetic algorithms** for large-scale optimization.
- Prioritize sequences that reduce total setup time while respecting due dates.

#### How It Uses Process Mining
- Extract setup time patterns from logs.
- Cluster jobs based on attributes that influence setup (e.g., material, size).
- Use **sequence mining** to find common setup-heavy transitions.

#### Addressed Pathologies
- Excessive setup times.
- Bottleneck overutilization.

#### Expected KPI Impact
- **Setup time**: -30% to -50%
- **Makespan**: -10% to -20%
- **Throughput**: +15% to +25%

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

---

### Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) for Strategy Evaluation

#### Framework
- Use **DES tools** (e.g., Simul8, AnyLogic, DESMO-J) to model the shop floor.
- Parameterize the simulation with:
  - Task duration distributions from logs.
  - Setup time matrices.
  - Breakdown frequencies and durations.
  - Job arrival rates and priorities.

#### Scenarios to Test
- **Baseline**: Current FCFS/EDD rules.
- **Strategy 1**: Dynamic dispatching.
- **Strategy 2**: Predictive scheduling.
- **Strategy 3**: Setup optimization.
- **Hybrid Strategies**: Combine dynamic dispatching + setup optimization.

#### KPIs to Compare
- Average job flow time
- % of jobs on time
- Average WIP
- Resource utilization
- Makespan under high load/disruptions

#### Expected Outcome
- Identify the most robust strategy under different shop floor conditions.
- Quantify the trade-offs (e.g., setup optimization improves throughput but may increase tardiness if not prioritized).

### Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation Framework

#### Real-Time Process Mining Pipeline

1. **Live Event Log Ingestion**
   - Stream MES logs to a central data lake (e.g., AWS S3, Snowflake).
   - Apply log cleaning and enrichment (e.g., job type clustering, due date inference).

2. **Automated Dashboarding**
   - Use **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Celonis** to monitor:

     - Tardiness KPIs
     - Setup time trends
     - Disruption frequency

3. **Drift Detection**
   - Use **statistical process control (SPC)** to detect:
     - Increases in average setup time.
     - Shifts in task duration distributions.
     - New job types or routing variants.

4. **Adaptive Scheduling Engine**
   - Integrate scheduling logic into a **digital twin** that:
     - Re-learns setup matrices and task durations weekly.
     - Recalibrates dispatching rules based on performance feedback.
     - Triggers alerts or rescheduling when deviations exceed thresholds.

5. **Feedback Loop**
   - Use simulation results to guide rescheduling decisions.
   - Re-train predictive models monthly with new data.
   - Conduct periodic variant analysis to detect process drift or new inefficiencies.
