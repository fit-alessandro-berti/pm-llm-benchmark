### **Case 3**

| Aspect                                    | Timing / Activity                                                       | Adherence to desiderata?               | Notes                                                         |

| Inform applicant timing                  | 2 days after approval (16 Jan vs. 14 Jan) — outside 48h window   | **No**                                | Slightly delayed beyond desirata, still acceptable             |
| Follow-up call                          | Not performed                                                          | Optional                              | No issue                                                     |

### **Summary of Desiderata Violations:**
- **Case 3:** Timing of credit check and informing applicant is outside recommended windows, but these are only desiderata, so not critical.

---

### **Final Summary**

| Case | Violates Normative Rules? | Violates Desiderata? | Notes                                                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | **No**                     | **No**               | Fully compliant in all aspects.                                                                        |
| **2**  | Yes                        | No                   | Violates core rules—missing credit check prior to risk assessment and finalizing after rejection.   |
| **3**  | No (sequence correct)      | Yes                  | Sequence correct; timing of activities outside recommended windows but not invalid per rules.        |

---

### **Concluding Remarks:**

- **Case 1** is fully compliant.
- **Case 2** should be reviewed to enforce proper sequence, especially ensuring credit checks occur before risk assessments and documentation is not finalized after rejection.
- **Case 3** illustrates how timing can be optimized; sequence is correct, but adherence to best practices could improve.
