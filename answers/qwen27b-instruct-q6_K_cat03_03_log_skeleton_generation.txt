Based on your description and requirements, I'll create a simple example of a Log Skeleton (LSK) model for an hypothetical "Purchase-to-Pay" (P2P) process. For the sake of simplicity, this LSK will focus only on basic constraints such as activity occurrence bounds, directly-follows, and equivalence.

The P2P process can generally consist of activities like initiating purchase orders (Order Initiation), approving these orders (Order Approval), receiving goods/services, invoicing, payment processing, and reconciliation. Let's define some simple rules for this process:

```python
import copy

# Create an empty dictionary to store the LSK model
log_skeleton_model = {}

# Constraints specific to each activity are defined as sets of tuples or integers.

# Activity occurrences bound (minimum 1, maximum 2)
activ_freq = {'OrderInitiation': {1}, 'OrderApproval': {1},
              'ReceivingGoods': {1}, 'Invoicing': {1}, 
              'PaymentProcessing': {1}, 'Reconciliation': {1}}

log_skeleton_model['activ_freq'] = copy.deepcopy(activ_freq)

# Directly-follows constraints
directly_follows = {
    ('OrderInitiation', 'OrderApproval'): True,
    ('OrderApproval', 'ReceivingGoods'): True,
    ('ReceivingGoods', 'Invoicing'): True, 
    ('Invoicing', 'PaymentProcessing'): True,
    ('PaymentProcessing', 'Reconciliation'): True
}

log_skeleton_model['directly_follows'] = directly_follows

# Equivalence constraints (example: if one order is initiated, then at least one approval is necessary)
equivalence = {
    ('OrderInitiation', 'OrderApproval'): set()
}

log_skeleton_model['equivalence'] = copy.deepcopy(equivalence)

# Always Before / After constraints are not specified in the original text and often depend on business logic.  
# They typically represent precedence rules, e.g., Order Approval must happen before Receiving Goods.
```

Note that I've only included directly-follows constraints since it's a common requirement for these types of process models. The `equivalence` constraint here is left with an empty set because in the P2P process, one order initiation does not necessarily mean exactly one approval; there could be multiple approvals per order.

This Python dictionary, `log_skeleton_model`, now represents the LSK model for a simplified P2P process, focusing on basic occurrence bounds and direct sequencing constraints. More complex rules such as Always Before/After would typically reflect the exact dependencies or precedence conditions between activities in your specific process flow.
