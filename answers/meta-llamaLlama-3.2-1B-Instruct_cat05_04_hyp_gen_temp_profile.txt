### Identified Anomalies

- **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: Average is around 25 hours, and STDEV is 7.6 hours (2 days), indicating a potential rigid approval schedule that is not easily explainable by the business logic.
- **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: Extremely long average delay of 7 days with a STDEV of 2 days, suggesting a backlog or significant delays in notification processing.
- **A to C (Assign to Close)**: Average is around 2 hours, and STDEV is 0.5 hours (0.83 minutes), indicating a very quick closure process without significant intermediate steps.
- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: Only 5 minutes on average between evaluation and notification, suggesting a too-quick transition without further checks.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

- **R to P delay**: It's possible that there's a manual or automated issue causing delays in approving claims, leading to the unusually long timeline.
- **P to N delay**: The extremely long delay could indicate a resource shortage or slow notification processes across the organization.
- **A to C delay**: The very quick closure might suggest that claims are being easily approved and closed, possibly due to streamlined processes or simply being hastily processed.
- **E to N transition**: The very short time between evaluating and notifying might be due to skipping of required steps or a process that doesn't involve immediate customer notification.

### Verification Queries

**Query 1:** Identify claims where the time between Receive and Approve is outside expected ranges.

```sql
SELECT * FROM claims 
WHERE timestamp >= (SELECT timestamp - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 FROM claims WHERE claim_type = 'home_insurance') 
AND timestamp < (SELECT timestamp + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 FROM claims WHERE claim_type = 'home_insurance');
```

**Query 2:** Correlate claims where Approval to Notify takes excessively long with adjusters, claim types, or regions.

```sql
WITH claimed_employees AS (
  SELECT adjuster_id, count(*) as numClaims 
  FROM claim_events 
  WHERE claim_type = 'home_insurance' 
  AND timestamp > (SELECT timestamp - 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 FROM claims WHERE claim_type = 'home_insurance') 
  GROUP BY adjuster_id
),
claims_overTime AS (
  SELECT claim_id, timestamp 
  FROM claim_events 
  WHERE timestamp > (SELECT timestamp - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 FROM claims WHERE claim_type = 'home_insurance') 
)
SELECT c.1, ca.numClaims, ce.numClaims, ca.source_region 
FROM claimed_employees ca, claims_overTime ce, claims c 
WHERE ca.numClaims = ca.numClaims OR ce.numClaims = ce.numClaims;
```

**Query 3:** Filter claims closed immediately after assignment and those where approval to notification takes extremely long.

```sql
SELECT * FROM claims 
WHERE (timestamp - (SELECT timestamp - 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 FROM claims WHERE claim_type = 'home_insurance')) < 2 * 24 * 60 * 60
OR (timestamp - (SELECT timestamp + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 FROM claims WHERE claim_type = 'home_insurance')) < 7 * 24 * 60 * 60;
```
