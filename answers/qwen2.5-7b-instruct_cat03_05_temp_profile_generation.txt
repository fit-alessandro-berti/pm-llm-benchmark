Certainly! Below is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the activities in the global supply chain process. The values for `average_time` and `standard_deviation` are estimated based on general industry practices and assumptions. Note that these times are placeholders and should be refined based on actual data from the event logs or industry benchmarks.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (2, 1),  # Days
    ('OP', 'RC'): (5, 2),  # Days
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3, 1),  # Days
    ('QI', 'CA'): (2, 1),  # Days
    ('CA', 'PT'): (1, 0.5),  # Days
    ('PT', 'PK'): (1, 0.5),  # Days
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1, 0.5),  # Days
    ('WS', 'DT'): (3, 1),  # Days
    ('DT', 'AS'): (5, 1),  # Days
    
    ('OP', 'CA'): (7, 2),  # Days, assuming inspection and assembly are closely linked
    ('CA', 'WS'): (2, 1),  # Days, after assembly, product is stored
    ('QI', 'DT'): (4, 2),  # Days, inspection and then immediate shipment
    ('PK', 'AS'): (2, 1),  # Days, packaging and then support
    
    ('SS', 'RC'): (7, 3),  # Days, from selection to receipt
    ('RC', 'DT'): (10, 3),  # Days, from receipt to distribution
    ('CA', 'AS'): (6, 2),  # Days, from assembly to support
    
    ('OP', 'AS'): (12, 4),  # Days, from order placement to support
    ('QI', 'PK'): (4, 2),  # Days, from inspection to packaging
    ('PK', 'DT'): (5, 2),  # Days, from packaging to distribution
    ('WS', 'AS'): (4, 2),  # Days, from storage to support
    ('DT', 'SS'): (8, 3)  # Days, from distribution back to selection
}
```

This dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs, some of which are separated by multiple steps. The `average_time` is provided in days, and the `standard_deviation` is provided in days as well. The values are estimated and can be adjusted based on actual data or more detailed analysis of the process execution logs.
