Why these new names?

1. Verify Documents  
   • The first occurrence in every case is the routine identity check at the start, so it is renamed “Verify Documents – Initial ID Check.”  
   • The second occurrence happens only after something changed (customer uploaded files, account corrected). It therefore becomes “Verify Documents – Re-check After …” with a short phrase (“Customer Submission”, “Account Correction”) to capture what triggered the second verification.

2. Call Customer  
   • C001: The purpose was to chase missing documentation  “Call Customer – Request Missing Documents.”  
   • C002 has two calls:
     – first to clear up a discrepancy  “Call Customer – Clarify Account Discrepancy;”  
     – second to confirm the fix  “Call Customer – Confirm Post-Adjustment.”  
   • C003: The only call was to bring the walk-out customer back  “Call Customer – Recall to Branch.”

These contextual qualifiers—“Initial,” “Re-check,” “Clarify,” “Confirm,” “Recall,” etc.—make each repeated activity’s intent explicit while leaving unique activities unchanged.
