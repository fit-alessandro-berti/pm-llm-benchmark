First, I need to create two POWL models based on the hiring process description.


## Building POWL Models  
- Need to develop two POWL models based on the hiring process description.  
- Focus on key elements like receiving applications, including resumes and questionnaires.  
- Include resume parsing and initial data extraction as critical steps.  
- Ensure models capture the sequence and details of the hiring workflow.  
- Aim to represent the process systematically for analysis and optimization.

## Building POWL Models  
- Include automated scanning with loops to request missing information, ensuring data completeness.  
- Feature preliminary skill assessment via online tests, with automatic disqualification below a threshold.  

## Examining Process Variations  
- Explore XOR choice for cultural fit or community affiliation check, with uplift for certain applicants in Model 1.  
- In Model 2, standardize the process by removing the XOR, ensuring all candidates go through the same cultural fit check.  

## Defining Model Activities  
- Incorporate activities like receiving applications and resume parsing as starting points for both models.

Below is the response to your query. I've produced two POWL models based on the provided textual description of the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. Both models reflect the core steps: receiving applications, initial data checks with loops for completeness, skill assessments, cultural fit evaluations, managerial reviews, and final decisions. They incorporate sequential ordering, loops (for data completeness), and choices (e.g., disqualification if skill scores are below threshold). However, the models differ in how they handle the cultural fit and affiliation check, as specified:

1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**: This model includes an XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch leads to a standard "CulturalFitCheck," while the other leads to a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that can provide a subtle advantage (e.g., uplift in evaluation) for applicants with specific affiliations. This introduces the potential for bias, as noted in the description (the XOR choice allows selective paths, with the affiliation branch enabling implicit score adjustments).

2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness**: This model removes the XOR branch and the special community affiliation check. All applicants proceed through the same standard "CulturalFitCheck," ensuring fairness by eliminating selective advantages. The rest of the process (loops, sequences, and choices for disqualification) remains similar for consistency.

I've used appropriate activity labels derived from the description (e.g., "ReceiveApplication," "ResumeParsing," "RequestMoreInfo," "SkillAssessment," "CulturalFitCheck," "CommunityAffiliationCheck," "ManagerialReview," "FinalDecision"). I've also included a choice for disqualification after skill assessment (applicants below threshold are disqualified via a silent transition, while those above proceed). Loops are used for data completeness, and sequential ordering is enforced where steps must occur in a specific order.

The models are defined using the POWL structure in pm4py, as per the provided example and instructions. Each is a root `StrictPartialOrder` containing nodes and edges for ordering, with `OperatorPOWL` for loops and XOR choices.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model demonstrates the unfairness by including an XOR after the skill assessment (pass branch). The XOR allows a choice between:
- Standard "CulturalFitCheck."
- "CommunityAffiliationCheck," which can lead to biased evaluations (subtle uplift for affiliated applicants).

The process starts with receiving the application, includes a loop for data completeness, then skill assessment with disqualification choice, then the biased XOR, and finally managerial review and decision.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions (activities)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
ResumeParsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsing")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
Disqualify = SilentTransition()  # Silent for disqualification if below threshold
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Biased check with potential uplift
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness (execute ResumeParsing, then choose to loop back with RequestMoreInfo or exit)
LoopDataCompleteness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ResumeParsing, RequestMoreInfo])

# Choice after SkillAssessment: disqualify or proceed (XOR between Disqualify and proceed path)
XorDisqualifyOrProceed = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Disqualify, CulturalFitCheck])  # Proceed to CulturalFitCheck if passing

# Biased XOR for cultural fit: choice between standard CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck (introduces unfairness)
XorCulturalFitOrAffiliation = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Root partial order: sequential steps with loop, choice, and biased XOR
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, LoopDataCompleteness, SkillAssessment, XorDisqualifyOrProceed, XorCulturalFitOrAffiliation, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add ordering edges
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, LoopDataCompleteness)  # Receive first
root.order.add_edge(LoopDataCompleteness, SkillAssessment)  # Data completeness before skill assessment
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, XorDisqualifyOrProceed)  # Skill assessment before disqualify/proceed choice
root.order.add_edge(XorDisqualifyOrProceed, XorCulturalFitOrAffiliation)  # Proceed to biased cultural fit XOR (only if not disqualified)
root.order.add_edge(XorCulturalFitOrAffiliation, ManagerialReview)  # Cultural fit before review
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)  # Review before final decision
```

**Explanation of Unfairness**: The XOR (`XorCulturalFitOrAffiliation`) after the skill assessment creates two paths: one standard (`CulturalFitCheck`) and one biased (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`). As per the description, applicants routed to `CommunityAffiliationCheck` may receive implicit score adjustments (e.g., uplift for local affiliations), leading to subtle unfairness. The disqualification choice (`XorDisqualifyOrProceed`) ensures only passing applicants reach this biased stage.

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model eliminates the XOR branch and the special "CommunityAffiliationCheck." All applicants proceed through the same standard "CulturalFitCheck" after skill assessment (if they pass the threshold). The loop for data completeness, disqualification choice, and sequential ordering remain, but there's no selective advantage branch, ensuring fairness.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions (activities)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
ResumeParsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsing")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
Disqualify = SilentTransition()  # Silent for disqualification if below threshold
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Standard check for all
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness (execute ResumeParsing, then choose to loop back with RequestMoreInfo or exit)
LoopDataCompleteness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ResumeParsing, RequestMoreInfo])

# Choice after SkillAssessment: disqualify or proceed (XOR between Disqualify and proceed path)
XorDisqualifyOrProceed = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Disqualify, CulturalFitCheck])  # Proceed to CulturalFitCheck if passing

# Root partial order: sequential steps with loop, choice, and standard cultural fit (no biased XOR)
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, LoopDataCompleteness, SkillAssessment, XorDisqualifyOrProceed, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add ordering edges
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, LoopDataCompleteness)  # Receive first
root.order.add_edge(LoopDataCompleteness, SkillAssessment)  # Data completeness before skill assessment
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, XorDisqualifyOrProceed)  # Skill assessment before disqualify/proceed choice
root.order.add_edge(XorDisqualifyOrProceed, ManagerialReview)  # Proceed to managerial review (only if not disqualified)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)  # Review before final decision
```

**Explanation of Fairness Removal**: By removing the XOR and `CommunityAffiliationCheck`, all qualifying applicants (those passing skill assessment) undergo the same `CulturalFitCheck`. This eliminates the selective branch that could introduce bias, as all follow a uniform path to managerial review and final decision. The disqualification choice remains to reflect the description, but no unfair advantages are possible. 

These models can be visualized or executed in pm4py for further analysis (e.g., to check for fairness in process mining). If you need additional details, such as code to render these models or extensions, let me know!
