**BPMN-Like Textual Process Model for Invoice Approval Workflow**

---

###  **Participants/Roles:**
- **Supplier**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**
- **Accounting System (System)**

---

###  **Artifacts (Inputs/Outputs):**
- **Invoice** (Input, provided by supplier via email)
- **Purchase Order (PO)**
- **PO Match Confirmation**
- **Discrepancy Notes**
- **Manager Approval**
- **Scheduled Payment**

---

###  **Main Process Flow (Happy Path):**

1. **[Start Event]**: *Invoice received from Supplier via email*

2. **[Task - Manual]**: *Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) checks if Invoice contains valid PO number*

    - **[Gateway - Exclusive]**: *Does the invoice contain a valid PO number?*
        - **Yes**  Proceed to Step 3  
        - **No**   
            - **[Task - Manual]**: Clerk sends invoice back to Supplier requesting missing PO.  
            - **[End Event - Exception Path]**: Process paused until revised invoice arrives.

3. **[Task - System]**: *Clerk logs invoice with associated PO into Accounting System*

4. **[Task - Manual]**: *Clerk sends invoice to Purchasing Officer (Dan) for confirmation of received goods/services*

5. **[Task - Manual]**: *Purchasing Officer compares invoice with PO (quantities, pricing, delivery charges)*

    - **[Gateway - Exclusive]**: *Is invoice consistent with the PO and received goods/services?*
        - **Yes**   
            - **[Task - Manual]**: Purchasing Officer sends confirmation email to Accounts Payable  
            - Proceed to Step 7
        - **No**  proceed to Step 6

6. **[Gateway - Inclusive]**: *Discrepant or incomplete invoice handling options (may occur singly or in combination)*  
    - **[Task]**: Purchasing Officer contacts Supplier for amendment **OR** asks Clerk to hold invoice  
    - **[Task]**: If issue cannot be resolved, Clerk escalates to Supervisor (Rita)  
    - **[Sub-process - Exception Handling]** (Performed by Supervisor):
        - Coordinates with Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) if contract terms need to be checked  
        - Contacts Supplier or Department Head for missing PO or clarification  
        - May advise creation of retrospective PO if no official PO exists (services purchased informally)  
        - Once resolved, resume to confirmation from Purchasing and continue to Step 7

7. **[Task - System Triggered]**: *System sends Manager (Carlos) invoice approval request (includes invoice, PO, confirmation data)*

8. **[Task - Manual]**: *Manager reviews and approves or rejects invoice*

    - **[Gateway - Exclusive]**: *Does Manager approve the invoice?*
        - **Yes** 
            - Proceed to Step 9
        - **No** 
            - **[Task]**: Manager rejects invoice or requests further investigation (done by Clerk or Supervisor)
            - Loop back to appropriate Exception Handling (Step 6)  
            - Upon resolution, restart Manager review (Step 8)

9. **[Task - Manual/System]**: *Accounts Payable Clerk schedules invoice for payment run in system*

10. **[End Event]**: *Invoice added to next payment cycle*

---

###  **Exceptions & Variations:**

- **Missing PO Number**: Results in immediate return to Supplier for clarification. Can delay processing until corrected document is received.

- **Discrepancy in Invoice**: May be handled by AP Clerk and Purchasing Officer initially. If unresolved, escalated to AP Supervisor.

- **No Formal PO**: For informally contracted services, Supervisor may need to coordinate with Department Head to issue retrospective PO or reject invoice.

- **Pricing Conflicts**: Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) may check against contract and facilitate resolution.

- **Manager Rejection**: If invoice appears suspicious or deviates from expected amounts, Manager can request a hold or investigation. Invoice re-enters exception handling until issue is resolved.

---

###  **Uncertainties or Clarifications Needed:**

- Whether the *Manager’s approval* or *Purchasing confirmation* goes first is generally consistent in interviews, but the system in place likely automates this in a fixed sequence (confirmation  approval).

- The resume point after exception handling may vary based on type of exception (may skip or redo certain verifications).

---

###  **Summary of Key Gateways (Decision Points):**

1. **Does the invoice contain a valid PO number?**
2. **Does the invoice match PO and goods/services?**
3. **Can discrepancy be resolved internally?**
4. **Manager’s approval: Approve or Reject?**
