The picture is a Petri-net–style process model that shows how an (insurance-like) claim is handled.  
Elements

1. White rounded rectangles = activities (transitions)  
   a  register request  
   b  examine thoroughly  
   c  examine casually  
   d  check ticket  
   e  decide  
   f  re-initiate request  
   g  pay compensation  
   h  reject request  
   z  end

2. Small black dots = places that hold the tokens; directed arcs connect places and activities.

Process flow (left-to-right, top-down)

• The process starts with a token in the place in front of activity a.  
• After “register request” (a) the flow is split so that the case can take one or more of three alternative/parallel examination routes:  
  – “examine thoroughly” (b)  
  – “examine casually” (c)  
  – “check ticket” (d)  
  (The fan-out pattern is an OR-split: any non-empty subset of the three activities may fire.)

• All chosen examination branches eventually reach the “decide” activity (e).  
  The incoming arrows meet in an OR-join, meaning e may fire as soon as at least one of the chosen branches has completed; remaining branches, if any, are cancelled.

• From “decide” the case can either
  – loop back to “re-initiate request” (f).  Activity f sends the token back to the register/examine part of the net, creating a rework cycle, or
  – continue to the final decision:

• Final decision is an XOR-split: either  
   – “pay compensation” (g) or  
   – “reject request”   (h).

• Both options converge in an XOR-join that leads to the “end” activity z, which consumes the last token and terminates the case.

Legend (bottom-right gray panel)

The inset explains the routing symbols used:

XOR-split / XOR-join  – exactly one branch taken / awaited  
AND-split / AND-join  – all branches taken / awaited  
OR-split / OR-join    – any non-empty subset taken / at least one awaited; unused branches are skipped

The graphical convention is: a fan-out of one, two, or three dots in front of (split) or after (join) a transition.

In short, the visualization is a workflow (Petri-net) that displays the main processing, alternative examinations, a rework loop, and the final accept/reject decision, together with a legend of XOR, AND and OR routing constructs.
