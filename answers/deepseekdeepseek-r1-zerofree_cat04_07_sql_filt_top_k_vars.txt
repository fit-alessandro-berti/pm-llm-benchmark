To solve for the given task, we need to follow these steps:

1. For each `case_id`, order activities by `timestamp` and concatenate them into a single string representing the "process variant" for that case.
2. Group cases by their process variant string and count the number of cases for each variant.
3. Identify the top K variants by case count.
4. Retrieve all events from the original event log where `case_id` belongs to one of these top K variants.

Let's assume `K` is a given value (let's say `K=3` for a specific example, but typically `K` should be a parameter that can be set in the query). 

### Step-by-step reasoning:

#### Step 1: For each `case_id`, order events by `timestamp` and concatenate the activity names into a single string representing the process variant.

To concatenate activity names ordered by `timestamp`, a common SQL function used is `LIST` or `ARRAY_AGG` combined with a `STRING_AGG` function where `STRING_AGG` concatenates string values in a group into a single string delimited by a separator (e.g., `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)`). However, DuckDB supports `STRING_AGG` and `LISTAGG` for string aggregation and `LIST` for creating an ordered list of values.

#### Step 2: Group by the concatenated string (process variant) and count how many `case_id` values fall into each group.

#### Step 3: Order the grouped results by the count of cases in descending order and limit the results to the top `K` variants.

#### Step 4: Join the top K variant results back to the original `event_log` table to filter out only those `case_id` values that match one of the top K variants.

#### Step 5: Return the events from the `event_log` for only those `case_id` values that belong to one of the top K variants.

Based on this reasoning, let us write the SQL query step by step. 

First, we need to find the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id`:

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS process_variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
```

This part orders activities by `timestamp` within each `case_id` and concatenates the `activity` values into a single string called `process_variant`, where activities are separated by a "->" symbol.

Next, we need to count the occurrences for each unique `process_variant` and identify the top K variants based on the count of `case_id` values associated with them.

```sql
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        process_variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM ordered_activities
    GROUP BY process_variant
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
```

This part groups the results from `ordered_activities` by `process_variant` and counts how many `case_id` values are associated with each variant. The results are ordered by `case_count` in descending order and limited to the top `K` variants.

To make it easier to join the top K variants back to the `event_log` table, we need a list of `case_id` values that belong to these top K variants. Thus, we need to join `ordered_activities` with `variant_counts` to get the `case_id` values that are part of the top K `process_variant` values:

```sql
top_k_case_ids AS (
    SELECT 
        oa.case_id
    FROM ordered_activities oa
    JOIN variant_counts vc
    ON oa.process_variant = vc.process_variant
)
```

This part filters `ordered_activities` to keep only those `case_id` values whose `process_variant` matches one of the top K variants listed in `variant_counts`.

Finally, we need to return all the events from the original `event_log` that have a `case_id` in the `top_k_case_ids`:

```sql
SELECT event_log.*
FROM event_log
JOIN top_k_case_ids tc
ON event_log.case_id = tc.case_id
ORDER BY event_log.case_id, event_log.timestamp;
```

This part joins the `event_log` table with `top_k_case_ids` to only keep rows where the `case_id` matches a `case_id` in the top K variants.

### Full SQL Query

Let's put it all together. Here we need to specify a value for `K` (let's assume `K=3` for this query, but you can replace `3` with any other value for `K`):

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS process_variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        process_variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM ordered_activities
    GROUP BY process_variant
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT 3
),
top_k_case_ids AS (
    SELECT 
        oa.case_id
    FROM ordered_activities oa
    JOIN variant_counts vc
    ON oa.process_variant = vc.process_variant
)
SELECT event_log.*
FROM event_log
JOIN top_k_case_ids tc
ON event_log.case_id = tc.case_id
ORDER BY event_log.case_id, event_log.timestamp;
```

#### Testing and Verification

To make sure the query makes sense, let us assume a sample `event_log` table:

| case_id | activity | timestamp |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| 1 | B | 2023-01-01 11:00:00 |
| 1 | C | 2023-01-01 12:00:00 |
| 2 | A | 2023-01-02 10:00:00 |
| 2 | B | 2023-01-02 11:00:00 |
| 2 | C | 2023-01-02 12:00:00 |
| 3 | A | 2023-01-03 10:00:00 |
| 3 | B | 2023-01-03 11:00:00 |
| 3 | D | 2023-01-03 12:00:00 |
| 4 | A | 2023-01-04 10:00:00 |
| 4 | B | 2023-01-04 11:00:00 |
| 4 | C | 2023-01-04 12:00:00 |
| 5 | A | 2023-01-05 10:00:00 |
| 5 | B | 2023-01-05 11:00:00 |
| 5 | E | 2023-01-05 12:00:00 |

Based on the given data, the `ordered_activities` CTE should produce:
```
case_id | process_variant
--------+-----------------
1       | A->B->C
2       | A->B->C
3       | A->B->D
4       | A->B->C
5       | A->B->E
```

The `variant_counts` CTE should produce something like:
```
process_variant | case_count
----------------+------------
A->B->C         | 3
A->B->D         | 1
A->B->E         | 1
```

If `K=2`, the top 2 variants would be:
```
process_variant | case_count
----------------+------------
A->B->C         | 3
```

However, if `K=2`, `A->B->C` has the highest case count (3 cases), so `A->B->D` and `A->B->E` both have a case count of one. However, `A->B->D` is the second most frequent variant only because it appears first in the order when the `case_count` is the same. However, `A->B->D` and `A->B->E` both have a case count of 1, so if `K=1`, only `A->B->C` variant should be considered. For `K=1`, `top_k_case_ids` should include `case_id` values `1`, `2`, and `4`.

The `top_k_case_ids` should thus contain `case_id` values `1`, `2`, and `4` if `K=1` (since `A->B->C` is the only top variant if `K=1`).

Finally, the `SELECT event_log.*` part should return all rows from `event_log` where `case_id` is `1`, `2`, or `4`.

### Final SQL Query (with `K=3` for a more general case where `K` should be defined):
```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS process_variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        process_variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM ordered_activities
    GROUP BY process_variant
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT 3
),
top_k_case_ids AS (
    SELECT 
        oa.case_id
    FROM ordered_activities oa
    JOIN variant_counts vc
    ON oa.process_variant = vc.process_variant
)
SELECT event_log.*
FROM event_log
JOIN top_k_case_ids tc
ON event_log.case_id = tc.case_id
ORDER BY event_log.case_id, event_log.timestamp;
```

This query should now provide the events from the `event_log` table for the `case_id` values that belong to the top `K` variants based on the frequency of the unique activity sequences ordered by timestamp.
