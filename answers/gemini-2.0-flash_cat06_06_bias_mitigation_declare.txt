# Explanation of added constraints:

# 1. Coexistence Constraints:
#    - These constraints ensure that whenever a decision (Approve or Reject) is made for an applicant belonging to a sensitive demographic (Minority, Female, Older, Younger), a "ManualReview" activity must also occur. This adds an extra layer of scrutiny to these cases, helping to prevent biased decisions.

# 2. Response Constraints:
#    - These constraints mandate a "BiasMitigationCheck" after activities that reveal sensitive attributes ("CheckApplicantRace", "CheckApplicantGender", "CheckApplicantAge"). This forces the process to explicitly consider and address potential biases before proceeding to a decision.

# 3. Succession Constraints:
#   - These constraints ensure that the "Approve" or "Reject" activities directly follow the "BiasMitigationCheck". This enforces that any decision must be made after the bias mitigation steps have been completed.

# 4. Non-Succession Constraints:
#    - These constraints prevent a "Reject" decision from immediately following a sensitive attribute check. This avoids the possibility of an immediate, potentially biased rejection based solely on sensitive information.  It forces the process to consider other factors and mitigation steps before rejection.
