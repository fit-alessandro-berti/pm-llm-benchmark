# Explanation of added constraints:
# - coexistence constraints for Approve_Minority and Reject_Minority with ManualReview:
#   These constraints ensure that whenever a decision (Approve or Reject) is made regarding a minority applicant,
#   a manual review is always performed. This provides an extra layer of scrutiny to prevent biased decisions.

# - response constraints for CheckApplicantRace and CheckApplicantAge with BiasMitigationCheck:
#   These constraints ensure that after an applicant's race or age is checked, a bias mitigation check is performed.
#   This aims to address any potential biases that might arise from considering these sensitive attributes.

# - non-succession constraints for CheckApplicantRace and CheckApplicantAge with Reject:
#   These constraints prevent a rejection decision from immediately following a check of the applicant's race or age.
#   This helps to prevent the appearance of bias by ensuring that other factors are considered before a rejection is made.

**Explanation of how these added constraints reduce bias:**

The added constraints aim to reduce bias by:

1.  **Ensuring Manual Review for Sensitive Groups:** The `coexistence` constraints trigger a `ManualReview` whenever decisions (approve or reject) are made for minority applicants. This provides an opportunity to identify and correct any biases that may have influenced the initial decision.

2.  **Triggering Bias Mitigation Checks:** The `response` constraints ensure that a `BiasMitigationCheck` is performed whenever an applicant's race or age is checked.  This forces the process to proactively consider and address potential biases associated with these attributes.  This might involve additional checks, documentation, or review by a fairness officer.

3.  **Preventing Immediate Biased Outcomes:** The `nonsuccession` constraints prevent a `Reject` decision immediately after a check of race or age.  This avoids situations where the decision *appears* to be directly based on these sensitive attributes, even if it isn't. This provides an opportunity for more information gathering, analysis and a more justified and fair decision.

By implementing these constraints, the model aims to make the loan application review process fairer and less susceptible to bias based on protected characteristics. The constraints encourage a more thorough and impartial assessment of each application, regardless of the applicant's race or age.
