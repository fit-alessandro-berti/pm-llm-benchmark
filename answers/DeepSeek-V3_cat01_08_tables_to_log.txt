### Assumptions:
1. **Order Arrived**: The `delivery_arrival_date` is used as the timestamp for the "Order Arrived" event.
2. **Payment Received**: The `payment_date` is used as the timestamp for the "Payment Received" event.
3. **Resource/Actor**: The `Resource/Actor` column is populated with the relevant resource ID (e.g., `WH-001` for warehouse staff, `BL-001` for billing clerks). If a resource is not applicable (e.g., payments), it is marked as "N/A".
4. **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered chronologically within each `order_id` to reflect the real process flow.
5. **Multiple Deliveries/Invoices/Payments**: For orders with multiple deliveries, invoices, or payments, separate events are created for each instance.

This event log is now ready for process mining analysis.
