### Analysis of Event Log and Inference of Activities

To infer the activities being performed in the manufacturing process, we will analyze the patterns in the sensor readings across the events. Each activity is likely associated with distinct changes in temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis and labeling process.

### **Step 1: Observing Patterns in Sensor Readings**

#### **Phase 1: Events 1–3**
- **Sensor Trends**:
  - Temperature: Low and stable (~20°C).
  - Pressure: Minimal (1 bar).
  - Vibration: None (0 Hz).
  - Material Flow: No flow (0 units/s).
  - Tool Position: Neutral (0 mm).
  - Energy Consumption: Very low (~0.40–0.50 kWh).

- **Interpretation**:
  - These events represent a machine in an idle or standby state. There is no significant activity, as indicated by minimal energy usage, no material flow, and no tool movement.

- **Label**: **Idle State**

---

#### **Phase 2: Events 4–6**
- **Sensor Trends**:
  - Temperature: Rapid increase from 50°C to 58°C.
  - Pressure: Slight increase to 1.5 bar.
  - Vibration: Moderate and increasing (30–38 Hz).
  - Material Flow: Steady at 5 units/s.
  - Tool Position: Gradual movement (5–10 mm).
  - Energy Consumption: High and increasing (2.00–3.00 kWh).

- **Interpretation**:
  - The rise in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption suggests that the machine is performing an operation involving heat and mechanical motion. The steady material flow indicates that material is being processed.
  - This pattern aligns with a **cutting operation**, where high temperatures and vibrations are typical due to friction and tool engagement.

- **Label**: **Cutting Metal**

---

#### **Phase 3: Events 7–8**
- **Sensor Trends**:
  - Temperature: Decrease to 40°C.
  - Pressure: Stable at 2 bar.
  - Vibration: Reduced but still present (10 Hz).
  - Material Flow: Reduced to 2 units/s.
  - Tool Position: Stationary at 15 mm.
  - Energy Consumption: Moderate and stable (2.00 kWh).

- **Interpretation**:
  - The drop in temperature and vibration, along with reduced material flow, suggests a transition phase after cutting. The machine may be stabilizing or preparing for the next operation.
  - This could correspond to **post-cutting stabilization** or a brief pause before the next activity.

- **Label**: **Stabilization Phase**

---

#### **Phase 4: Event 9**
- **Sensor Trends**:
  - Temperature: Spike to 80°C.
  - Pressure: Stable at 2 bar.
  - Vibration: High (50 Hz).
  - Material Flow: No flow (0 units/s).
  - Tool Position: Stationary at 15 mm.
  - Energy Consumption: Very high (5.00 kWh).

- **Interpretation**:
  - The sudden spike in temperature and vibration, coupled with no material flow, suggests a high-energy operation that does not involve material movement. This is consistent with **welding**, which generates intense heat and vibration without requiring continuous material flow.

- **Label**: **Welding**

---

#### **Phase 5: Events 10–12**
- **Sensor Trends**:
  - Temperature: Gradual decrease from 30°C to 25°C.
  - Pressure: Minimal (1 bar).
  - Vibration: Low (1–5 Hz).
  - Material Flow: Minimal (0–1 units/s).
  - Tool Position: Movement to 20 mm.
  - Energy Consumption: Moderate (1.00–1.60 kWh).

- **Interpretation**:
  - The cooling trend, low vibration, and minimal material flow indicate a winding-down phase. The slight tool movement and moderate energy usage suggest that the machine is performing a final adjustment or inspection.
  - This aligns with **quality inspection** or **final adjustments**.

- **Label**: **Quality Inspection**

---

#### **Phase 6: Events 13–15**
- **Sensor Trends**:
  - Temperature: Low and stable (~20°C).
  - Pressure: Minimal (1 bar).
  - Vibration: None (0 Hz).
  - Material Flow: No flow (0 units/s).
  - Tool Position: Neutral (0 mm).
  - Energy Consumption: Very low (~0.40–0.50 kWh).

- **Interpretation**:
  - Similar to Phase 1, these events indicate the machine returning to an idle state. All readings stabilize at baseline levels.

- **Label**: **Idle State**

### **Step 2: Summary of Labeled Activities**

| Event Range | Activity Label          | Rationale                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–3         | Idle State             | Low energy, no material flow, neutral tool position.                      |
| 4–6         | Cutting Metal          | High temperature, vibration, and energy; steady material flow.            |
| 7–8         | Stabilization Phase    | Decreased temperature and vibration; reduced material flow.               |
| 9           | Welding                | Spike in temperature and vibration; no material flow.                     |
| 10–12       | Quality Inspection     | Cooling trend, low vibration, minimal material flow, tool adjustments.    |
| 13–15       | Idle State             | Return to baseline readings, indicating machine idling.                   |

### **Step 3: Final Process Flow**

Based on the labeled activities, the inferred process flow is as follows:

1. **Idle State**  Machine is inactive.
2. **Cutting Metal**  Material is cut using high heat and vibration.
3. **Stabilization Phase**  Transition period after cutting.
4. **Welding**  High-energy operation to join parts.
5. **Quality Inspection**  Final checks and adjustments.
6. **Idle State**  Machine returns to standby.

### **Conclusion**

By analyzing patterns in sensor readings, we have successfully inferred the sequence of activities in the manufacturing process. This approach demonstrates how process mining techniques can extract meaningful insights from raw event logs, even in the absence of explicit activity labels.
