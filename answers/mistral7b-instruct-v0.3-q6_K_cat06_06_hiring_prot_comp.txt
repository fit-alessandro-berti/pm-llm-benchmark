 From the provided data, it appears that the main differences between the treatment processes of the protected and unprotected groups lie in the following aspects:

1. **Expert Examinations**: In the process variants for the unprotected group, there is a higher frequency of 'Expert Examination' steps compared to the protected group. This could indicate a more intensive diagnostic process for the unprotected group.

2. **Thorough Examinations**: There are more instances of 'Thorough Examination' in the process variants for the unprotected group, which might suggest a more detailed diagnostic process or higher severity cases in this group.

3. **Treatment Unsuccessful**: The frequency of 'Treatment unsuccessful' followed by 'Treatment successful' is higher in the unprotected group, implying that the treatments for this group may have a higher rate of initial failure and subsequent corrective treatment.

4. **Discharge**: There are more instances of 'Discharge' without any preceding process steps in the protected group compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate a quicker discharge process for the protected group or perhaps less complex cases. However, it's worth noting that this is not necessarily a negative difference as it could also mean faster recovery for patients in the protected group.

5. **Process Variability**: The unprotected group shows higher variability in the number of steps and the order of those steps compared to the protected group. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as different hospital policies or resource availability. However, it may also indicate less standardization or consistency in the treatment process for the unprotected group.

Without additional context or data, it's difficult to definitively say whether these differences are unfair. It would be important to consider factors such as patient health conditions, resource allocation, and institutional policies to determine if these observed differences are justified.
