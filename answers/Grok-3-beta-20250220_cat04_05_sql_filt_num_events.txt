Let me help you craft a DuckDB SQL query for this requirement. Here's a clear solution with explanations:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_counts cc
    ON el.case_id = cc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

Let's break down how this query works:

1. First, we create a CTE (Common Table Expression) called `case_counts` that:
   - Groups the events by `case_id`
   - Counts the number of events per case
   - Uses HAVING to filter only cases with 6 or fewer events

2. Then, in the main query:
   - We select all columns (`el.*`) from the original `event_log`
   - Join it with our `case_counts` CTE to keep only events from cases that meet our criteria
   - The INNER JOIN ensures we only get events from cases with â‰¤ 6 events

3. The ORDER BY clause:
   - Sorts results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for better readability
   - This is optional but makes the output more organized

Alternative approach using a subquery:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

Both queries will produce the same result. The CTE version might be more readable and maintainable, while the subquery version is more concise. In terms of performance with DuckDB, both should be efficient, though the CTE version might allow better optimization in some cases.

The output will include all original columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, and any others) for only those cases that have 6 or fewer events total.
