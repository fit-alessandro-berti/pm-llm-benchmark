1. What strategic factors informed the choice of component suppliers across Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the USA, and how often are these sourcing decisions revisited to reflect geopolitical or market changes?  

2. In what ways could early-stage market research be expanded or refined to reduce late-stage design iterations and downstream disruptions?  

3. How does the R&D team capture lessons learned from previous prototype cycles to shorten time-to-market without compromising innovation quality?  

4. What contingency plans exist if one or more component suppliers experience political instability, natural disasters, or trade restrictions, and how quickly can alternative suppliers be qualified?  

5. How might introducing digital twins or advanced simulation tools improve visibility and coordination across the parallel component-securing streams?  

6. What are the cost-benefit trade-offs between maintaining a single Malaysian assembly plant versus adopting a multi-plant or near-shoring strategy?  

7. How is the optimal balance determined between air freight and ocean shipping, and what data sources feed that decision in real time?  

8. Which key performance indicators (KPIs) best capture the effectiveness of the 24/7 assembly operation, and how are those KPIs communicated to frontline teams?  

9. What root-cause analytics are in place to distinguish between assembly errors and component defects during quality checks, and how does this influence supplier negotiations?  

10. How could automated feedback loops shorten the cycle time between quality-check failures and corrective actions on the assembly line?  

11. What role do sustainability goals (e.g., carbon footprint, e-waste reduction) play in the choice of transportation modes and packaging materials throughout the supply chain?  

12. How are customs and regulatory compliance requirements monitored for changes, and what cross-functional forums ensure timely updates to documentation and labeling?  

13. In what ways can regional distribution centers leverage advanced demand-sensing analytics to rebalance inventory proactively across continents?  

14. How is information about VIP/pre-order shipments prioritized and shared among logistics partners to safeguard customer experience?  

15. What governance structure exists to arbitrate conflicts between e-commerce and retail channel demands when inventory is constrained?  

16. How are supplier scorecards constructed to incorporate not just price and lead time but also innovation capability, ESG performance, and supply-chain resilience?  

17. What predictive-maintenance strategies could be applied to critical assembly equipment to reduce unplanned downtime in the 24/7 operation?  

18. How might blockchain or other distributed-ledger technologies enhance end-to-end traceability and stakeholder trust across the component life cycle?  

19. Which scenarios trigger the “Adjust Orders to Suppliers” pathway, and how is the financial impact of those adjustments modeled and communicated to executive leadership?  

20. How are post-launch performance reviews structured to capture cross-functional insights and feed them into the planning of the next sales cycle?
