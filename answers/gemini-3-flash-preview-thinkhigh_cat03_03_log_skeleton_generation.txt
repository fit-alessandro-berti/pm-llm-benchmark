Based on the scenario provided, here is the construction of the Log Skeleton as a Python dictionary. 

In this model, we assume a standard successful execution path where each step is required and occurs once in a specific sequence.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # Equivalence: If one occurs, the other occurs the same number of times.
    # In a standard linear process, all activities should occur exactly once.
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), ('RO', 'RI'), ('RO', 'PI'), ('RO', 'QC'), 
        ('RO', 'PO'), ('RO', 'GSL'), ('RO', 'D'), ('RO', 'IC'), ('RO', 'RP')
    },

    # Always Before: If the first occurs, the second must have occurred previously.
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'), 
        ('RI', 'CA'), 
        ('PI', 'RI'), 
        ('QC', 'PI'), 
        ('PO', 'QC'), 
        ('GSL', 'PO'), 
        ('D', 'GSL'), 
        ('IC', 'D'), 
        ('RP', 'IC')
    },

    # Always After: If the first occurs, the second must occur later.
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), 
        ('CA', 'RI'), 
        ('RI', 'PI'), 
        ('PI', 'QC'), 
        ('QC', 'PO'), 
        ('PO', 'GSL'), 
        ('GSL', 'D'), 
        ('D', 'IC'), 
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },

    # Never Together: Activities that cannot co-exist in the same case.
    # In this specific flow, all activities are part of the same lifecycle, so this is empty.
    'never_together': set(),

    # Activity Occurrences: Allowed number of times an activity can appear in a case.
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {0, 1},
        'CA': {0, 1},
        'RI': {0, 1},
        'PI': {0, 1},
        'QC': {0, 1},
        'PO': {0, 1},
        'GSL': {0, 1},
        'D': {0, 1},
        'IC': {0, 1},
        'RP': {0, 1}
    },

    # Directly-Follows: If the first occurs, the second must occur immediately after.
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), 
        ('CA', 'RI'), 
        ('RI', 'PI'), 
        ('PI', 'QC'), 
        ('QC', 'PO'), 
        ('PO', 'GSL'), 
        ('GSL', 'D'), 
        ('D', 'IC'), 
        ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
```

### Key Logic used:
1.  **Directly-Follows & Sequence:** The warehouse process follows a logical physical and administrative chain (Receive -> Check -> Reserve -> Pick -> Quality -> Pack -> Label -> Dispatch -> Invoice -> Payment).
2.  **Equivalence:** Since this is a standard fulfillment process, we assume that if an order is received (`RO`), every subsequent step must also occur exactly once to complete the case.
3.  **Always Before/After:** These constraints reinforce the strict ordering. For example, `('QC', 'PI')` in `always_before` ensures that you cannot perform a Quality Check without having Picked Items first.
4.  **Activity Frequencies:** Each activity is modeled to occur either 0 times (if the case is just started or fails) or 1 time (upon successful completion).
