Assumptions and notes:
- Case identification: case_id = order_id.
- Activity derivation:
  - Order Created from Orders.order_date.
  - Item Picked per order line using Order Lines.item_picking_date; one event per line to keep item-level detail.
  - Delivery Dispatched and Delivery Arrived per Delivery record.
  - Invoice Issued per Invoice record.
  - Payment Received per Payment record (linked via invoice_id to the order).
- Resources:
  - Mapped from Resources table where IDs exist (sales, warehouse, carrier, billing).
  - For Payment Received, the actor is set to the customer (resource_id = customer_id, actor = Customer, role = Customer) since no internal resource is provided.
- Case attributes (customer_id, customer_type, order_priority) are repeated on every event row for filtering and case-level context.
- No derived completion events were added; the log stops at the last observed event per order.
- All timestamps are used as provided (UTC Z).
