## Key Insights:

1. **Sequential Flow**: The process follows a clear sequence from idea to launch
2. **Mandatory Activities**: Core activities (IG, DD, AG, FL) must always occur
3. **Parallel Evaluations**: TFC and CE typically happen together after design
4. **Testing Dependencies**: Both lab and user testing depend on prototype creation
5. **No Backward Flow**: Once launched, the process doesn't return to earlier stages
6. **Approval Gate**: Critical checkpoint that must follow feasibility/cost checks and precede launch activities
