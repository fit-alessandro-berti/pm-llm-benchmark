To complete this task, we need to thoroughly analyze both POWL models provided against what would be considered a standard or normative sequence for a typical "Hire-to-Retire" workflow.

**Standard Hire-to-Retire Process Overview:**
A traditional Hire-to-Retire process includes the following activities in order:
1. **Post Job Advertisement:** This is the initial step where an organization advertises a job opening to attract potential candidates.
2. **Screen Candidates:** Once applications are received, candidate resumes and qualifications are reviewed.
3. **Conduct Interviews:** Shortlisted candidates are invited for interviews.
4. **Make Hiring Decision:** Based on interviews (and possibly other criteria), the hiring decision is made.
5. **Onboard Employee:** The selected candidate goes through an orientation process to integrate them into the organization.
6. **Add to Payroll System:** After onboarding, the new employee's details are entered into the payroll system for compensation and benefits management.
7. **Close Case:** Finally, the hiring case is closed after all necessary steps have been completed.

**Analysis of POWL Model 1:**
```python
model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```
In Model 1:
- The sequence begins with posting the job advertisement (`Post`), followed by screening candidates (`Screen`).
- Then it branches into two possible activities: conducting interviews (`Interview`) or making a hiring decision (`Decide`). This is where an anomaly arises because usually, a decision should not be made before interviewing. An organization typically screens and then conducts interviews to inform the decision-making process.
- Once the hiring decision is made, onboarding occurs (`Onboard`), followed by adding the employee to the payroll system (`Payroll`) and finally closing the case (`Close`).

Anomalies in Model 1:
- **Bypassing Interviews:** The sequence allows for making a hiring decision without conducting interviews. This could potentially lead to poor candidate selection if decisions are made based on resumes alone.
  
Overall, Model 1 presents an anomaly that fundamentally contradicts standard practices by allowing the hiring process to proceed without interviewing candidates.

**Analysis of POWL Model 2:**
```python
model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close])
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview)
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```
In Model 2:
- The sequence begins with posting the job advertisement (`Post`), followed by parallel activities of screening candidates (`Screen`) and conducting interviews (`Interview`). This reflects a typical process where these steps can happen concurrently.
- After interviewing, there's a decision to be made (`Decide`). From here, it transitions into an onboarding loop (`loop_onboarding`).
- The use of the loop operator for onboarding might allow for repeated attempts at onboarding (perhaps if initial attempts are unsatisfactory), which is not standard but can occur in some organizations.
- Finally, there's a choice between adding to payroll (`Payroll`) and skipping this step (`skip`). This could represent an anomaly as it allows the case to close without ensuring that the new hire has been added to the payroll system.

Anomalies in Model 2:
- **Skipping Payroll Addition:** Allowing for a scenario where the payroll addition is skipped before closing the case poses a significant issue. It's crucial for organizational operations and compliance to ensure all employees are correctly added to the payroll.
  
**Comparing Models:**
- Both models contain anomalies but they differ in nature and severity of these deviations from standard process logic.
- Model 1 has an anomaly that could have serious implications on the integrity of the hiring decision (bypassing interviews).
- Model 2's most severe issue is allowing for a critical step, payroll addition, to be potentially skipped.

**Conclusion:**
Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process than Model 2. Despite its issues in skipping over interviews before making hiring decisions, the sequence of essential steps from screening through onboarding and closing is maintained logically without significant omissions that impede core business processes. In contrast, Model 2 permits an activity critical for employee compensation to be omitted altogether which represents a more severe deviation from standard practice.

**Justification:**
A normative Hire-to-Retire process cannot omit critical steps like interviewing candidates or payroll addition due to the fundamental implications these have on organizational operations and legal compliance. While both models introduce anomalies, Model 2 introduces one that directly impacts the core function of integrating a new employee into an organization’s financial records - something no operational workflow should allow for in practice.
