To infer the case groupings from the interleaved sequence of hospital process events, we can look for sequences of activities that logically belong together based on patient demographics (`patient_age`, `patient_gender`), the order of activities, and their timestamps. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the events can be grouped into cases:

1. **Case 1 (Patient Age: 45, Gender: M, Department: ER)**
   - 1. Register patient
   - 4. Initial triage
   - 7. X-ray imaging
   - 12. Doctor consultation
   - 15. Patient discharged

2. **Case 2 (Patient Age: 62, Gender: F, Department: ER)**
   - 2. Register patient
   - 5. Initial triage
   - 8. Lab test requested
   - 10. Lab test completed
   - 11. Doctor consultation
   - 14. Prescription created
   - 17. Patient discharged

3. **Case 3 (Patient Age: 28, Gender: M, Department: Surgery)**
   - 3. Register patient
   - 6. Doctor consultation
   - 9. Surgery preparation
   - 13. Surgery performed
   - 16. Recovery room
   - 18. Patient discharged

Below is the explicit grouping of events into cases based on the attributes and logical order:

### Case 1 (Patient Age: 45, Gender: M, Department: ER)
- 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, Register patient
- 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z, Initial triage
- 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, X-ray imaging
- 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, Doctor consultation
- 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z, Patient discharged

### Case 2 (Patient Age: 62, Gender: F, Department: ER)
- 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z, Register patient
- 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z, Initial triage
- 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, Lab test requested
- 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, Lab test completed
- 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, Doctor consultation
- 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, Prescription created
- 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, Patient discharged

### Case 3 (Patient Age: 28, Gender: M, Department: Surgery)
- 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, Register patient
- 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, Doctor consultation
- 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, Surgery preparation
- 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, Surgery performed
- 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, Recovery room
- 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, Patient discharged

By organizing the events based on patient demographics and the logical sequence of activities, we can infer the distinct cases from the interleaved sequence.
