Based on the provided event log, we can derive a process tree that captures the main flow of activities, the optional loop for requesting missing information and re-validation, and the final steps of approval, confirmation, and archival. Here is the final structure of the process tree:

```plaintext
+ ( 'Receive Application (RA)', -> (
    'Validate Form (VF)',
    * (
        -> (
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
            'Request Missing Info (RMI)'
        ),
        'Validate Form (VF)'
    ),
    'Approval Decision (AD)',
    'Send Confirmation (SC)',
    'Archive Case (AC)'
) )
```

### Explanation:

1. **Parallel Execution (`+`)**: The process starts with the activity "Receive Application (RA)" which can be executed in parallel with the main sequence of activities.

2. **Main Sequence (`->`)**:
   - **Validate Form (VF)**: This activity is executed first.
   - **Loop (`*`)**: This loop captures the possibility of assessing eligibility and requesting missing information multiple times.
     - **Sequence (`->`)**: Within the loop, "Assess Eligibility (AE)" is followed by "Request Missing Info (RMI)".
     - After the loop, "Validate Form (VF)" is executed again.
   - **Approval Decision (AD)**: This activity follows the loop.
   - **Send Confirmation (SC)**: This activity follows the approval decision.
   - **Archive Case (AC)**: This is the final activity in the sequence.

This process tree captures the main flow of activities, the optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation, and the final steps of approval, confirmation, and archival.
