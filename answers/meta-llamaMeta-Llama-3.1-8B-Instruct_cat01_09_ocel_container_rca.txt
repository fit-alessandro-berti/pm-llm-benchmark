After analyzing the directly follows graph, I've identified several potential root causes for the performance issues in the process:

1. **Excessive container handling**: The process involves a large number of container-related events (e.g., "Order Empty Containers", "Pick Up Empty Container", "Load to Vehicle", "Weigh", "Place in Stock"). This may indicate inefficiencies in container handling, leading to longer processing times.
2. **Truck loading and unloading**: The "Load Truck" and "Drive to Terminal" events are frequent, but the durations are relatively long (5259.71 and 10999.07, respectively). This might suggest that truck loading and unloading processes are time-consuming or inefficient.
3. **Container rescheduling**: The "Reschedule Container" event has a relatively high duration (7110.06) and is connected to several other events (e.g., "Book Vehicles", "Load to Vehicle"). This could indicate that rescheduling containers is a complex or time-consuming process.
4. **High variability in container processing**: The durations for events like "Weigh" (1960.09) and "Place in Stock" (743380.51) vary significantly. This might indicate that the processing times for containers are not consistent or are dependent on external factors.
5. **Forklift usage**: The Forklift object type has a relatively high number of events, which could indicate that forklifts are being used extensively in the process. However, the durations for these events are relatively short, which might suggest that forklift usage is not a major bottleneck.
6. **Transport document creation**: The "Create Transport Document" event has a long duration (329005.22), which might indicate that creating transport documents is a complex or time-consuming process.
7. **Departure delays**: The "Depart" event has a relatively long duration (1007066.16) and is connected to several other events (e.g., "Order Empty Containers", "Reschedule Container"). This could suggest that departures are being delayed or that the process is waiting for external factors to complete.

To address these performance issues, you may want to consider:

* Optimizing container handling processes to reduce the number of events and durations.
* Improving truck loading and unloading processes to reduce processing times.
* Streamlining container rescheduling processes to reduce duration and variability.
* Investigating the root causes of high variability in container processing times.
* Reviewing forklift usage to ensure it's being used efficiently.
* Analyzing the transport document creation process to identify areas for improvement.
* Investigating departure delays to identify the root causes and potential solutions.

Keep in mind that these are specific data-driven insights, and further analysis may be necessary to confirm these findings and identify additional root causes.
