### Analysis of Event Log

#### 1. Cases with Longer Resolution Times:
The resolution times for all cases were calculated by measuring the duration between the `Receive Ticket` and `Close Ticket` activities for each case:

- **Case 101**: ~2 hours 15 minutes  
- **Case 102**: ~25 hours 10 minutes  
- **Case 103**: ~1 hour 20 minutes  
- **Case 104**: ~24 hours 10 minutes  
- **Case 105**: ~49 hours 5 minutes  

Cases **102**, **104**, and **105** have significantly longer resolution times compared to the others, especially **Case 105**, which is the slowest.

#### 2. Root Causes of Performance Issues:

##### **2.1. Escalations**
- **Case 102**, **Case 104**, and **Case 105** involve escalations to Level-2 agents, which inherently introduce delays. 
- For example, in **Case 105**, there’s a gap of nearly **29 hours** between escalating the ticket at 10:00 AM on March 1 and resuming investigation at 2:00 PM on March 2.

##### **2.2. Long Waiting Times Between Activities**
- **Case 102**: There’s a gap of **2.5 hours** between `Triage Ticket` and `Assign to Level-1 Agent`, and another gap of **16 hours** between escalation and investigation by Level-2 agents.
- **Case 104**: A delay of **3.5 hours** occurs between assigning the ticket and starting investigation. Additionally, the investigation step is delayed until **16 hours** after escalation.

##### **2.3. Early vs. Late Resolution Steps**
- Cases with faster resolution times (**Case 101** and **Case 103**) have investigation steps completed within 1–2 hours after the ticket is assigned. Escalation is avoided in these cases, and tickets progress linearly.
- Cases with longer resolution times, like **Case 105**, exhibit delays between the initial investigation and resolution, exacerbated by an escalation.

#### 3. Factors Contributing to Increased Cycle Times:

##### **3.1. Process Bottlenecks from Escalation**
- Tickets escalated to Level-2 agents tend to face delays due to unavailability or lack of capacity within the specialized team.
- Escalation itself requires additional coordination, adding to the total resolution time.

##### **3.2. Prolonged Handoffs**
- Delays between sequential steps (e.g., assigning to agents, starting investigations) suggest inefficiencies in task handoffs.
- These delays might stem from miscommunication, lack of resource availability, or process gaps in initiating the next step promptly.

##### **3.3. Lack of Clear Priority**
- Cases with escalation or long delays before the investigation may indicate poor prioritization of critical tickets or resource allocation mismatches.

#### 4. Recommendations:

1. **Optimize Escalation Process**
   - **Recommendation**: Streamline the escalation process by preemptively identifying tickets likely to require specialized support and routing them directly.
   - **Impact**: Reduces delays by minimizing coordination overhead and ensuring Level-2 availability in advance.

2. **Monitor and Improve Task Handoffs**
   - **Recommendation**: Implement automated notifications or tracking systems to ensure no unnecessary delays between sequential tasks.
   - **Impact**: Ensures faster handoffs between triage, assignment, and investigation steps.

3. **Increase Resource Availability**
   - **Recommendation**: Assign more resources to Level-2 teams to handle escalations promptly.
   - **Impact**: Reduces backlogs and ensures escalated tickets progress as efficiently as non-escalated ones.

4. **Analyze and Address Root Causes of Escalation**
   - **Recommendation**: Review cases requiring escalation to identify recurring issues (e.g., lack of expertise at Level-1 or unclear ticket details).
   - **Impact**: Helps resolve tickets at Level-1 more effectively, reducing the need for escalation.

5. **Introduce SLA Monitoring**
   - **Recommendation**: Establish Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for each step in the process with automated alerts for breaches.
   - **Impact**: Ensures accountability and adherence to performance benchmarks.

### Summary of Insights:
- Escalation and delays between activities are the primary contributors to long resolution times.
- Streamlining the escalation process, improving task handoffs, and addressing bottlenecks in resource allocation can significantly improve the ticket resolution cycle.
