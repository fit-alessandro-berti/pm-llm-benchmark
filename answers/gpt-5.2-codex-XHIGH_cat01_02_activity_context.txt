Below is a contextaware renaming of activities so that each repeated label now reflects **why** it happens at that point in the case.

---

##  1) Recurring Activities & Contextual Meaning

**Repeated within a case (key disambiguations):**
- **Verify Documents**  
  - First occurrence = *initial check*  
  - Second occurrence = *reverification after new information*
- **Call Customer**  
  - C002 has two calls: *clarification* vs *confirmation*

**Repeated across cases with different meaning:**
- **Initiate Request** (online portal vs branch walkin)
- **Adjust Account** (after discrepancy vs correction for missing info)

##  3) Justification for Naming Choices

- **Verify Documents  Initial / Reverify**  
  Context clearly shows the first check vs a followup check after new docs or account correction.

- **Call Customer  Purposebased names**  
  Calls have different reasons (missing docs, discrepancy clarification, confirmation, return to branch), so the name now captures intent.

- **Initiate Request  Channelspecific**  
  Online portal vs inbranch walkin significantly changes the nature of initiation.

- **Adjust Account  Reasonspecific**  
  One adjusts after discrepancy, the other corrects missing data — now reflected in names.
