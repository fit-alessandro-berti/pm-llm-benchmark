   - **Confidence score: 10**

2. **What steps are involved in preparing the implements?**
   - **Confidence score: 8**

3. **Does the process involve hand washing?**
   - **Confidence score: 10**

4. **What steps are taken to ensure the operator is sterile?**
   - **Confidence score: 10**

5. **In what order does the patient positioning take place?**
   - **Confidence score: 9**

6. **Are there multiple methods for identifying areas of interest during the ultrasound configuration?**
   - **Confidence score: 10**

7. **What is the role of the Doppler identification task?**
   - **Confidence score: 8**
