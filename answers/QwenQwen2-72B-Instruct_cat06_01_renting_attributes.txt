In the context of fairness in machine learning, sensitive attributes typically refer to the features that may imply information about the socially constructed groups protected against discrimination by law or standard. The sensitive attributes might influence (unintentionally or not) the outcomes of the decisions made in procedures or processes. If these attributes correlate with the process outcome, then there's a risk for biased decision-making.

Given the attributes you've described from the event log detailing the process in the rental and property management domain, the potentially sensitive attributes include but are not limited to:

1. `case:citizen` - Indicates whether the tenant is a citizen or not. This might include information regarding the nationality, immigration status, or potentially racial background (though indirectly).

2. `case:gender` - The gender of the individual. Gender discrimination is a significant concern and can affect property transactions if not handled responsibly.

3. `case:german speaking` - Represents an individual's language skills, which can be correlated with their country of origin or other demographic characteristics, and can also potentially lead to bias if it influences the decision-making process.

4. `case:married` - Marital status may be considered sensitive as it could be connected to family status and other socio-economic factors that imply bias or discrimination.

Note that fairness in decision-making also involves the influence of these sensitive attributes on the outcome of the process. Here are the potential ways these attributes might affect the process:

1. The likelihood of being `pay rent` or `miss rent payment` might not be directly related to being a `citizen`, speaking `german`, `gender`, or marital status. However, indirect biases could exist if, for example, individuals who do not speak German natively are given fewer opportunities to secure employment, which can affect their ability to pay rent on time.

2. Activities corresponding to `move in`, `sign contract`, and `accept late payment` could indirectly relate to `gender`, `citizen`, `spoken language`, and `marital status`. For instance, female applicants might be perceived as less stable financially simply based on gender stereotypes or prospective tenants who don't speak the local language might be automatically deemed less reliable, which is often a manifestation of bias.

3. Activities related to `tenant cancels appartment`, `issue warning`, and `evict tenant` should logically stem from the fulfilment of contractual agreements or breaches thereof, which can be affected by biases if they are based on the `gender`, status of `citizen`, spoken language abilities, and `mar
