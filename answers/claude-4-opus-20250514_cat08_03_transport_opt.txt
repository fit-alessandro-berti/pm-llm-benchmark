# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: A Comprehensive Approach to Last-Mile Delivery Optimization

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

To create a cohesive event log suitable for process mining, I would implement the following preprocessing approach:

**Integration Strategy:**
- **Unified Case ID**: Define cases at multiple levels:
  - Primary: Vehicle-Day (e.g., V12-20241205) for daily route analysis
  - Secondary: Package-ID for individual delivery tracking
  - Tertiary: Driver-Day for driver performance analysis

- **Event Harmonization**:
  ```
  Standardized Event Structure:
  - Timestamp (UTC normalized)
  - Case ID (hierarchical)
  - Activity Name (standardized taxonomy)
  - Resource (Vehicle ID, Driver ID)
  - Additional Attributes (location, speed, package details)
  ```

**Key Challenges and Solutions:**

1. **Data Synchronization**: GPS data streams at high frequency (every 10-30 seconds) while scanner events are discrete. Solution: Create meaningful activity abstractions (e.g., "Traveling", "Stopped in Traffic", "At Customer Location") by aggregating GPS data using threshold-based rules.

2. **Location Matching**: GPS coordinates must be matched to customer addresses and depot locations. Solution: Implement geofencing with 50-meter radius around known locations and fuzzy matching algorithms.

3. **Data Quality Issues**: Missing scans, GPS signal loss, system downtimes. Solution: Implement interpolation for short gaps and flag cases with >10% missing data for separate analysis.

### Process Discovery Approach

I would employ a multi-algorithm strategy for comprehensive process discovery:

1. **Inductive Miner**: For the main delivery process flow, as it guarantees sound process models and handles loops well (important for multiple delivery attempts).

2. **Heuristics Miner**: To identify less frequent patterns and exceptional cases (e.g., maintenance interruptions, unusual route deviations).

3. **Fuzzy Miner**: For analyzing complex GPS trajectory data to identify common travel patterns and recurring bottlenecks.

**Process Model Layers:**
- **High-Level Model**: Depot  Route Start  Delivery Sequence  Route End  Depot
- **Detailed Delivery Model**: Arrive Location  Park  Walk to Customer  Delivery Attempt  Return to Vehicle
- **Exception Handling Model**: Failed Delivery  Reattempt Decision  Return to Depot/Continue Route

### Conformance Checking Methodology

**Alignment Analysis:**
1. **Token Replay**: Compare planned route sequences against actual execution to calculate fitness scores
2. **Deviation Categories**:
   - **Sequence Deviations**: Deliveries performed out of planned order
   - **Skip Deviations**: Planned stops not visited
   - **Insert Deviations**: Unplanned stops (breaks, fuel, maintenance)
   - **Time Deviations**: Significant delays against planned schedule

**Conformance Metrics:**
- **Fitness Score**: Percentage of cases following planned routes (target: >85%)
- **Precision Score**: How much observed behavior is allowed by the plan
- **Timing Conformance**: Actual vs. planned time per stop (±15-minute tolerance)

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR)**
   ```
   OTDR = (Deliveries within time window / Total deliveries) × 100
   Calculation: Extract from events where "Delivery Success" timestamp falls within customer-requested window
   ```

2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop (ATDS)**
   ```
   ATDS = Sum(Depart Customer - Arrive Customer) / Number of stops
   Target: <5 minutes for standard deliveries
   ```

3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio (TTSR)**
   ```
   TTSR = Total travel time / Total service time
   Optimal range: 1.5-2.0 (indicating efficient routing)
   ```

4. **Fuel Efficiency Metrics**
   ```
   - Fuel per package = Total fuel consumed / Packages delivered
   - Idle time percentage = Time with engine on & speed=0 / Total engine time
   ```

5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate (VUR)**
   ```
   VUR = Actual delivery time / Available shift time
   Target: >80% excluding mandatory breaks
   ```

6. **Failed Delivery Rate (FDR)**
   ```
   FDR = Failed delivery attempts / Total delivery attempts
   Impact: Each failure adds ~20 minutes for re-delivery
   ```

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

**1. Performance Spectrum Analysis:**
- Create dotted charts showing case duration distributions
- Identify cases in the bottom 20% performance quartile
- Analyze common characteristics (routes, times, drivers)

**2. Activity Duration Analysis:**
- Calculate average, median, and standard deviation for each activity type
- Flag activities with coefficient of variation >0.5 as high-variability bottlenecks

**3. Resource Performance Comparison:**
- Compare KPIs across vehicles, drivers, and routes
- Use ANOVA to determine statistical significance of differences

**4. Temporal Pattern Mining:**
- Analyze performance variations by:
  - Hour of day (rush hour impacts)
  - Day of week (Monday/Friday peaks)
  - Seasonal patterns (holiday seasons)

**5. Geospatial Bottleneck Mapping:**
- Overlay GPS tracks with delay events
- Identify recurring congestion zones
- Correlate with urban infrastructure (construction, schools, commercial areas)

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### Systematic Root Cause Investigation

**1. Route Planning Inefficiencies**
- **Analysis Method**: Compare optimal TSP solutions with actual routes
- **Findings Indicators**: 
  - >20% longer distances than optimal
  - Frequent backtracking patterns
  - Poor stop clustering

**2. Traffic Impact Quantification**
- **Analysis Method**: Correlate speed data with time/location
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Average speed during peak hours: <15 km/h indicates severe congestion
  - Delay propagation: How initial delays cascade through the day
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify predictable congestion patterns

**3. Service Time Variability Analysis**
- **Clustering Analysis**: Group delivery locations by service time characteristics
  - Quick drops (<2 min): Office buildings with reception
  - Standard (2-5 min): Residential with easy access
  - Complex (>5 min): Apartments, businesses requiring signatures
- **Driver Impact**: Compare same-location service times across drivers

**4. Vehicle Reliability Assessment**
- **Predictive Indicators**:
  - Correlation between vehicle age/mileage and breakdown frequency
  - Pattern mining for pre-breakdown warning signs (multiple unscheduled stops)
- **Cost Impact**: Each breakdown averages 2-hour delay + towing costs

**5. Failed Delivery Pattern Analysis**
- **Root Causes**:
  - Time window mismatches (arriving outside customer availability)
  - Address/access issues
  - Package problems (damaged, wrong item)
- **Quantification**: Each failed delivery costs ~€15 in re-delivery expenses

### Validation Techniques

**1. A/B Testing Analysis:**
- Compare performance when different routing algorithms are used
- Analyze natural experiments (e.g., driver substitutions)

**2. Regression Analysis:**
- Multi-factor regression to quantify impact of each variable
- Control for confounding factors (weather, package volume)

**3. Process Variant Comparison:**
- Compare top 10% performing cases vs. bottom 10%
- Identify systematic differences in process execution

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies
