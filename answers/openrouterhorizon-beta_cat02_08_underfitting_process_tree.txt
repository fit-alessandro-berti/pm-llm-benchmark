1) Example of an invalid-but-accepted trace
Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order, Close_Order, Close_Order

2) Why this is problematic
- Double closing: The root tree is SEQUENCE(..., xor_node, Close_Order). The cancel branch already contains a Close_Order, and the success branch does not—but in your model the success branch (PARALLEL of Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order) can complete and then the root adds another Close_Order. Because PARALLEL allows any order among its children, and nothing in the tree prevents Close_Order from occurring even after Ship_Order (and again at the end), a trace with two Close_Order activities is accepted. In reality, an order should be closed exactly once.

Other invalid-but-accepted traces the model allows:
- Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Ship_Order, Package_Items, Authorize_Payment, Close_Order
  Problem: Shipping before payment authorization violates business rules; PARALLEL permits any order among the three activities.
- Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Cancel_Order, Close_Order, Close_Order
  Problem: Double closing after cancellation.
- Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Authorize_Payment, Close_Order
  Problem: Closing without packaging/shipping (the PARALLEL block allows skipping relative ordering constraints, and the model does not enforce that shipping must occur before closing in the success path).
