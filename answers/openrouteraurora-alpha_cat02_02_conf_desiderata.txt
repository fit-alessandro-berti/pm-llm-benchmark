### 1.Normativerule violations  

| Case | Violations (hard rules) | Why it is a violation |
|------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **2** | 1 **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** – the log shows *Risk Assessment* at 08:20 and *Credit Check* at 09:00.  <br>2 **Missing “Inform Applicant”** – after the loan decision (Rejected) there is no “Inform Applicant” event.  <br>3 **Finalize Documentation after a Rejection** – the activity *Finalize Documentation* occurs at 10:00, but the decision was *Rejected*. The normative model forbids any finalisation when the outcome is negative. | All three break the mandatory ordering/conditional constraints: <br>• CreditCheck must precede RiskAssessment. <br>• InformApplicant must occur after the decision. <br>• Documentation may be finalised **only** when the decision is *Approved*. |
| **1** | – | No hardrule breach – the sequence follows the prescribed order and the conditional branch (Approved  Finalise  Close) is respected. |
| **3** | – | No hardrule breach – the sequence follows the prescribed order and the conditional branch (Approved  Finalise  Close) is respected. |

> **Bottom line:** *Case2* is the only case that violates the normative process constraints.

### 2.Desiderata (softrule) deviations  

| Case | Desideratum not met | Explanation (suboptimal but not fatal) |
|------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **2** | – | Because the case already fails hard rules, the softrule assessment is secondary. |
| **3** | 1 **Credit Check delayed >24h** – the check happens two days after receipt. <br>2 **Inform Applicant delayed >48h after decision** – the applicant is told two days after the decision. <br>3 **No Followup Call** – the optional “Followup Call” activity is missing. | These are only recommendations: they affect service quality and timeliness but do not break the process definition. |
| **1** | – | All timing recommendations are satisfied (credit check within0.5h, inform applicant within2h) and the optional call is simply omitted, which is permissible. |

> **Note:** The desiderata violations are *noncritical*; they indicate that the execution was slower or less thorough than the bestpractice target, but the process still complied with the mandatory rules.

### 3.Possible interpretations / justifications  

| Observation | Reasonable justification (consistent with the constraints) |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Case2 – Risk Assessment before Credit Check** | The organization may have a “prescreen” step that automatically triggers a riskassessment based on limited data, with the formal creditcheck being performed later. The log records the formal creditcheck after the preliminary assessment, but the normative model still expects the creditcheck first. |
| **Case2 – Missing Inform Applicant** | The decision may have been communicated by a channel that is not captured in the event log (e.g., an automated email sent by the decision engine). If the system does not log that communication, the activity appears absent, even though the business rule was respected. |
| **Case2 – Finalize Documentation after Rejection** | The “Finalize Documentation” entry could be a generic “closeout” activity that was mistakenly labelled, or the documentation may have been a “rejection letter” that still needs to be prepared. The normative rule forbids any documentation finalisation for a rejected case, so this would be a processdesign issue that needs correction. |
| **Case3 – Credit Check >24h** | The loan may have required additional information from the applicant (e.g., missing income proof) before a credit check could be executed, causing a delay. The process still respects the required order, just not the recommended time window. |
| **Case3 – Inform Applicant >48h** | The decision might have been pending a manual underwriting review that took longer than expected, pushing the notification out of the 48hour window. Again, the order is correct, only the timeliness suffers. |
| **Case3 – No Followup Call** | The followup call is optional; perhaps the case handler judged that the applicant was already wellinformed and that a call would add little value. The omission is permissible under the desiderata definition. |

#### Summary  

* **Normative violations:** only **Case2** (ordering errors, missing informapplicant, illegal finalisation after rejection).  
* **Desiderata breaches:** **Case3** (late credit check, late applicant notification, missing optional followup call).  
* **Case1** complies with both the hard rules and the recommended timing, so it is the “goldstandard” execution.  

Addressing the hardrule breaches in Case2 (reordering activities, ensuring the “Inform Applicant” step is logged, and suppressing documentation finalisation for rejections) is essential. Improving the timing of credit checks and notifications, and optionally adding a followup call, would lift the softrule performance of Case3 toward the bestpractice target.
