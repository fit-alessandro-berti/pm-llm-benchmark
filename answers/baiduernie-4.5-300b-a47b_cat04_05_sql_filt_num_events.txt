Here's a properly crafted DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the specified task:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
  -- Count events per case_id to filter out cases with >6 events
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    COUNT(*) AS num_events
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6  -- Only keep cases with 6 or fewer events
)

-- Return all events from the qualifying cases
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_event_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id;
```

### Explanation:

1. **CTE `case_event_counts`**: 
   - Groups events by `case_id` and counts the number of events per case.
   - Uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter out cases with more than 6 events (keeping only those with 6 or fewer).

2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins the original `event_log` table with the filtered list of `case_id` values to return all events from the qualifying cases.
   - This approach ensures we efficiently filter cases upfront (in the CTE) and only return relevant events in the final result.

### Alternative (Single-Query Version):
If you prefer a single query without a CTE, here's an equivalent approach:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

Both versions correctly implement the required logic to:
1. First identify cases with 6 or fewer events.
2. Then return all events from those qualifying cases.
