Explanation of the added constraints
1. existence(BiasMitigationCheck) & existence(ManualReview)  
   Guarantees that every trace contains at least one explicit control intended to detect or correct unfair treatment.

2. coexistence(Approve, ManualReview) and coexistence(Reject, ManualReview)  
   Ensures that every automatic accept/reject outcome is accompanied by a human-in-the-loop review, preventing fully automated (and potentially biased) decisions.

3. response(CheckSensitiveAttribute, BiasMitigationCheck)  
   For every inspection of a sensitive attribute (race, gender, age) the process must subsequently perform a BiasMitigationCheck, obliging the system to reflect on potential disparate impact before moving on.

4. succession(BiasMitigationCheck, FinalDecision)  
   Forces the final decision to take place only after the bias-mitigation activity, making the check operationally effective.

5. nonchainsuccession(CheckSensitiveAttribute, FinalDecision)  
   Explicitly forbids the sensitive-attribute event from being directly followed by the FinalDecision in the log. This blocks the shortest, most dangerous path to a biased outcome in which the attribute inspection immediately “triggers” the decision.

Together these constraints break any “shortcut” from sensitive information to a loan decision, demand human oversight, and embed a dedicated bias-detection step before the case is closed—thus reducing the possibility of discriminatory behaviour in the loan-application process.
