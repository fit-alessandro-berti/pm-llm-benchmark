SR = Transition(label="Service Request")

# --- Step 1 & 2: Initial Setup and Parallel Tasks ---

# The process starts with SR, followed by CS.
# These two are sequential, but since the overall model is a PO, 
# we start with a PO that includes SR and CS.

# Initial sequential tasks (SR -> CS)
# Followed by parallel tasks (DA and ACI)

# The overall structure of the first segment (SR -> CS -> {DA || ACI}) 
# will be managed by the root PO structure.

# Intermediate PO for parallel tasks DA and ACI (they are part of the larger PO)
# Since DA and ACI are defined as independent activities that start AFTER CS, 
# they don't need their own isolated PO model unless they had internal structure.

# --- Step 3: Looped Configuration Phase ---

# Loop: execute BNC, then either exit or execute DR and BNC again.
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[BNC, DR]
)

# --- Step 4: Exclusive Choice for Deployment ---

# Exclusive Choice (XOR) between CD and MD.
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[CD, MD]
)

# --- Step 5 & 6: Final Tasks and Sign-off ---

# The entire model is built around a single StrictPartialOrder (Root)

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    SR,

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Define the Partial Order (Dependencies)
# ----------------------------------------------------

# 1. SR must precede CS
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# 2. CS must precede the parallel tasks DA and ACI
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# 3. DA and ACI must both precede the loop_config (BNC/DR loop)
# Note: Since they are parallel, they only need to be independent of each other,
# but both must complete before the next step.
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_config)

# 4. The loop_config must precede the xor_deployment
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, xor_deployment)

# 5. The xor_deployment must precede the final parallel tasks (QA and SA)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, QA)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, SA)
# Note: QA and SA are independent of each other (concurrent)

# 6. Both QA and SA must precede the final GLA
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# The final constructed POWL model is stored in the variable `root`.
print("POWL Model Construction Complete.")
# For verification, we can inspect some of the structure:
# print(f"Root nodes: {[n.label if isinstance(n, Transition) else n for n in root.nodes]}")
# print(f"Order Edges: {root.order.edges}")
