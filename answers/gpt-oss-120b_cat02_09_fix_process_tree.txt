**1. Issues with the current under‑fitting model**

The current tree is  

\[
\text{SEQ}\bigl(\text{Create\_Req},\ \text{Approve\_Req},\ \text{PARALLEL}(\dots),\ \text{Close\_Case}\bigr)
\]

where the parallel block contains  

\[
\{\text{Create\_PO},\ \text{Receive\_Goods},\ \text{Receive\_Invoice},\ \text{Match\_Invoice\_to\_PO},\ \text{Pay\_Invoice}\}
\]

Because the **PARALLEL** operator allows its children to fire in any order (or even concurrently), the model accepts executions such as  

* *Pay Invoice* → *Receive Goods* → *Receive Invoice*  
* *Match Invoice\_to\_PO* before a *Purchase Order* exists  

These behaviours are **illegal** in a typical Procure‑to‑Pay (P2P) process. The domain dictates a strict ordering:

1. **Create Requisition → Approve Requisition → Create PO** – the PO cannot be created before the requisition is approved.  
2. **Receive Goods** must precede **Receive Invoice** (the supplier can only invoice after delivery).  
3. **Match Invoice to PO** can only happen after the invoice is received *and* after the PO exists.  
4. **Pay Invoice** must be the last step before the case is closed.  

Thus, the activities that must be **sequential** are:

\[
\text{Create\_Req} \;\rightarrow\; \text{Approve\_Req} \;\rightarrow\; \text{Create\_PO} \;\rightarrow\; \text{Receive\_Goods} \;\rightarrow\; \text{Receive\_Invoice} \;\rightarrow\; \text{Match\_Invoice\_to\_PO} \;\rightarrow\; \text{Pay\_Invoice} \;\rightarrow\; \text{Close\_Case}
\]

No parallelism is required; the only place where a **choice** (XOR) could be introduced is if the process allowed *early closing* when no invoice is generated (e.g., a “no‑invoice” path). In the simplified scenario we keep a single linear flow.

**2. Corrected process‑tree model**

Below is a Python snippet that builds a **strictly sequential** process tree.  
The code is formatted with *Prettier* (print‑width = 80) and uses the `pm4py` library exactly as the original example.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# Fixed Procure‑to‑Pay process tree (strict sequence)

from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Activities (leaf nodes)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build the strict sequence
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The whole process is a single SEQUENCE node whose children are the
# eight activities in the exact order required by the domain.
root = ProcessTree(
    operator=Operator.SEQUENCE,
    children=[
        create_req,
        approve_req,
        create_po,
        receive_goods,
        receive_invoice,
        match_invoice,
        pay_invoice,
        close_case,
    ],
)

# The `root` object now represents the corrected model.
```

If you need to keep a *optional* early‑close path (e.g., when no invoice is generated), you could replace the final two nodes with an XOR block, but the above version enforces the canonical flow.

**3. How the updated tree guarantees domain‑conformant behaviour**

| Property | Original model | Fixed model |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Ordering of requisition → PO** | Parallel block allowed `Create_PO` before `Approve_Req`. | `Create_Req → Approve_Req → Create_PO` enforced by the outer SEQUENCE. |
| **Goods receipt before invoicing** | `Receive_Goods` could be interleaved arbitrarily with `Receive_Invoice`. | `Receive_Goods → Receive_Invoice` is a mandatory sub‑order. |
| **Invoice‑matching after invoice receipt** | `Match_Invoice_to_PO` could fire before `Receive_Invoice`. | `Receive_Invoice → Match_Invoice_to_PO` guarantees the invoice exists first. |
| **Payment after matching** | `Pay_Invoice` was parallel to all other steps, allowing premature payment. | `Pay_Invoice` is placed after `Match_Invoice_to_PO`, so payment only occurs once the invoice is matched. |
| **Case closure** | `Close_Case` followed the parallel block, so it could close before all activities finished. | `Close_Case` is the final child of the SEQUENCE, guaranteeing that every preceding activity has completed. |

Because the **SEQUENCE** operator admits only one possible ordering of its children, any execution trace that deviates from the canonical Procure‑to‑Pay order will be **rejected** by the model. No parallelism or nondeterministic choices are present, so the model is *tight* (i.e., it does not over‑generalise) and eliminates the under‑fitting behaviour observed previously.
