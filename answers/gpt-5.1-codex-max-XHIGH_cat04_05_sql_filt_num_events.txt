You can do this with a subquery that first counts events per case_id, filters to those with six or fewer, and then returns all events for those cases. For example:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) c ON e.case_id = c.case_id;
```

This joins the original table against the subset of case IDs that have 6 or fewer events.
