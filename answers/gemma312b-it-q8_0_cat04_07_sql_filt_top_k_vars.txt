**Explanation:**

1. **`OrderedEvents` CTE:**
   - This CTE selects the `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` from the `event_log` table.
   - It orders the events within each `case_id` by `timestamp` to establish the correct activity sequence.

2. **`VariantSequences` CTE:**
   - This CTE groups the ordered events by `case_id`.
   - `GROUP_CONCAT(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` concatenates the activities within each case into a single string, preserving the order defined by the `timestamp`. This string represents the process variant for that case.

3. **`VariantCounts` CTE:**
   - This CTE groups the variants generated in the previous step and counts the number of cases that follow each variant.

4. **`TopKVariants` CTE:**
   - This CTE selects the top K variants (in this example, K=10) based on their frequency (count) from the `VariantCounts` CTE.  The `LIMIT` clause determines the number of top variants to retrieve.

5. **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
   - This statement joins the original `event_log` table with the `VariantSequences` and `TopKVariants` CTEs.
   - The join conditions ensure that only events belonging to cases that follow one of the top K variants are included in the final result.  The `event_log` table is aliased as `el` for brevity.

**How to use:**

1.  **Create the `event_log` table:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE event_log (
        case_id TEXT,
        activity TEXT,
        timestamp DATETIME
    );
    ```

2.  **Populate the `event_log` table with sample data:**
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO event_log (case_id, activity, timestamp) VALUES
    ('case1', 'A', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
    ('case1', 'B', '2023-01-01 11:00:00'),
    ('case1', 'C', '2023-01-01 12:00:00'),
    ('case2', 'A', '2023-01-02 09:00:00'),
    ('case2', 'B', '2023-01-02 10:00:00'),
    ('case3', 'A', '2023-01-03 08:00:00'),
    ('case3', 'C', '2023-01-03 09:00:00'),
    ('case4', 'A', '2023-01-04 07:00:00'),
    ('case4', 'B', '2023-01-04 08:00:00'),
    ('case4', 'C', '2023-01-04 09:00:00'),
    ('case5', 'A', '2023-01-05 11:00:00'),
    ('case5', 'B', '2023-01-05 12:00:00'),
    ('case5', 'C', '2023-01-05 13:00:00');
    ```

3.  **Execute the SQL query:**  Run the provided SQL query in your DuckDB environment.

The query will return all events from the `event_log` table that belong to cases following one of the top 10 most frequent process variants.  You can adjust the `LIMIT` clause in the `TopKVariants` CTE to change the value of K.
