### **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times**

To determine which cases are taking longer than average, we'll first calculate the **total resolution time** for each case, which is the time from **"Receive Ticket"** to **"Close Ticket"**.

#### **Case 101**  
- **Start:** 2024-03-01 08:00  
- **End:** 2024-03-01 10:15  
- **Total Time:** 2 hours 15 minutes = **135 minutes**

#### **Case 102**  
- **Start:** 2024-03-01 08:05  
- **End:** 2024-03-02 09:15  
- **Total Time:** 25 hours 10 minutes = **1510 minutes**

#### **Case 103**  
- **Start:** 2024-03-01 08:10  
- **End:** 2024-03-01 09:30  
- **Total Time:** 1 hour 20 minutes = **80 minutes**

#### **Case 104**  
- **Start:** 2024-03-01 08:20  
- **End:** 2024-03-02 08:30  
- **Total Time:** 24 hours 10 minutes = **1450 minutes**

#### **Case 105**  
- **Start:** 2024-03-01 08:25  
- **End:** 2024-03-03 09:30  
- **Total Time:** 49 hours 5 minutes = **2945 minutes**

---

### **Average Resolution Time:**

Let’s compute the average resolution time:

- Case 101: 135 min  
- Case 102: 1510 min  
- Case 103: 80 min  
- Case 104: 1450 min  
- Case 105: 2945 min  

**Total = 135 + 1510 + 80 + 1450 + 2945 = 6120 minutes**  
**Average = 6120 / 5 = 1224 minutes  20.4 hours**

---

### **Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times:**

| Case ID | Total Time | Compared to Average |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| 101     | 135 min    | 1224 min  **Much shorter** |
| 102     | 1510 min   | **Significantly longer** |
| 103     | 80 min     | 1224 min  **Much shorter** |
| 104     | 1450 min   | **Significantly longer** |
| 105     | 2945 min   | **Significantly longer** |

### **2. Determine Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues**

Let’s analyze the **delayed cases** (102, 104, 105) to identify **root causes**.

#### **Case 102 (1510 minutes):**
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent** occurs at 11:30 AM, which is **2.5 hours after assignment** to Level-1 Agent.
- **Investigation** starts at 2:00 PM the next day (2024-03-01 to 2024-03-02).
- **Total delay between escalation and investigation**: ~18 hours.
- **Root Cause**: Long wait time after escalation; **no immediate action** from Level-2 Agent.

#### **Case 104 (1450 minutes):**
- **Investigation** starts at 1:00 PM, **3.5 hours after assignment** to Level-1 Agent.
- **Resolution** happens 24 hours later.
- **Root Cause**: **Long delay before investigation**; possible lack of agent availability or low priority.

#### **Case 105 (2945 minutes):**
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent** occurs at 10:00 AM, **1 hour after investigation** started.
- **Investigation** with Level-2 Agent starts on **next day (2024-03-02 2:00 PM)**.
- **Resolution** happens **11 hours later**.
- **Root Cause**: **Escalation delay**; **investigation delayed by over 24 hours** after escalation.

### **Common Patterns Across Delayed Cases:**

1. **Escalation Delays**:
   - Cases 102 and 105 involved escalation to Level-2 agents, but the escalation **did not lead to immediate resolution**.
   - Escalation was **not followed by prompt action** from the specialized team.

2. **Long Waiting Times Between Activities**:
   - Cases 102, 104, and 105 had **long gaps** between key steps (e.g., assignment to agent, escalation, investigation).
   - These **waiting periods** could be due to:
     - **Agent unavailability**
     - **Low prioritization**
     - **Lack of clear escalation protocols**

3. **No Immediate Resolution After Escalation**:
   - Escalation does not always guarantee **timely resolution**.
   - There is a **gap between escalation and investigation**, which is **not ideal**.

### **3. Insights and Recommendations**

#### **Insights:**

- **Escalation does not guarantee prompt resolution.**
- **Long waiting times between key steps** (e.g., assignment to agent, escalation, investigation) are **major contributors to delays**.
- **Level-2 agents are not always available or responsive** in a timely manner.

#### **Recommendations:**

1. **Improve Escalation Protocols:**
   - Ensure that **escalated tickets are immediately assigned** to Level-2 agents with **clear SLAs**.
   - Implement **automated alerts** or **task assignment systems** to ensure prompt response.

2. **Monitor Waiting Times Between Activities:**
   - Use **process mining tools** to track **waiting times** between key steps (e.g., assignment to agent, escalation, investigation).
   - Flag cases where **waiting times exceed thresholds** (e.g., >2 hours between assignment and investigation).

3. **Prioritize Tickets Based on Complexity and Escalation:**
   - Implement a **ticket prioritization system** that gives **higher priority** to escalated tickets.
   - Use **real-time dashboards** to track the **status and progress** of all tickets.

4. **Improve Agent Availability and Workload Distribution:**
   - Ensure that **Level-1 and Level-2 agents are available** when needed.
   - Use **workload balancing algorithms** to distribute tickets evenly across agents.

5. **Conduct Root Cause Analysis on Delayed Cases:**
   - Perform **post-mortem reviews** for delayed tickets to identify **specific bottlenecks**.
   - Use this data to **train agents** and **refine processes**.

---

### **Conclusion:**

The **primary factors** contributing to **delayed resolution times** are:
- **Escalation delays** without prompt action.
- **Long waiting times** between key steps.
- **Lack of prioritization** and **agent availability** after escalation.

By **streamlining escalation protocols**, **monitoring key waiting times**, and **improving agent availability**, the **resolution time** for customer support tickets can be **significantly reduced**, leading to **better customer satisfaction** and **operational efficiency**.
