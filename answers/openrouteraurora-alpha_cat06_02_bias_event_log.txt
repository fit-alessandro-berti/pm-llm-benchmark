### 1.What the log tells us

| Case |LocalResident|CommunityGroup|Prescore|Adjustment|Adjustedscore|Final decision |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **C001** | TRUE | HighlandCivicDartsClub | 710 | **+10(Community)** | **720** | Approved |
| **C002** | TRUE | *None* | 720 | 0 | 720 | Approved |
| **C003** | FALSE | *None* | 715 | 0 | 715 | **Rejected** |
| **C004** | TRUE | HighlandCivicDartsClub | 690 | **+10(Community)** | **700** | Approved |
| **C005** | FALSE | *None* | 740 | 0 | 740 | Approved |

A few patterns jump out:

1. **A flat +10 point “Community” boost** is applied *only* when the applicant belongs to the “Highland Civic Darts Club”.  
2. The boost is **not tied to any measurable risk factor** (e.g., payment history, debttoincome ratio). It is a *socialaffiliation* proxy.  
3. **Localresident status alone does not trigger a boost**, but it cooccurs with the communitygroup cases (C001, C004).  
4. The **final decision rule appears to be a simple scorethreshold** (720approval, <720rejection) *unless* the community boost pushes a case over the threshold.

### 2.Where bias manifests

| Dimension | How it appears in the log | Why it is a bias risk |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Community affiliation** | +10 points for members of “Highland Civic Darts Club”. | The boost is *discriminatory* because it rewards a *voluntary* social tie that is not related to credit risk. Applicants who are equally creditworthy but lack that affiliation are penalised. |
| **Geography / “localresident” flag** | All communitygroup cases are also marked **TRUE** for LocalResident, but no explicit boost is given for the flag itself. | The cooccurrence suggests the model may be *implicitly* favouring people who live in a particular neighbourhood (the “Highland” area). If the system later adds a hidden weight for LocalResident, the impact could be even larger. |
| **Manualreview influence** | The manual reviewer’s comment column is empty for the communitygroup cases (Reviewer#7, #2) but the score is already “Adjusted” before the reviewer sees it. | The reviewer may be **reinforcing** the bias by not questioning the community boost, or by allowing it to stand unchallenged. |
| **Thresholdbased decision** | Cases with raw scores of 715 (C003) and 690 (C004) are treated differently because the latter receives the community boost. | A *hard* threshold combined with an arbitrary boost creates a **disparate impact**: a nonresident with a raw score of 715 is rejected, while a resident with a raw score of 690 is approved after the boost. |

### 3.Why these adjustments matter for fairness & equity

| Scenario | Raw creditworthiness (score) | With community boost | Decision | Fairness implication |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Resident, no community** | 720 | 720 | Approved | No bias (score already above threshold). |
| **Resident, community** | 690 | **700** (still below 720)  *approved* because the system appears to treat the boost as a “qualifier” rather than a strict threshold. | Approved | **Positive disparate impact** – the applicant gets a loan they would not have earned on credit alone. |
| **Nonresident, no community** | 715 | 715 | Rejected | **Negative disparate impact** – the applicant is denied despite a score that is *higher* than the approved residentcommunity case (690700). |
| **Nonresident, high score** | 740 | 740 | Approved | No bias, but the decision is driven solely by raw credit. |

**Key takeaways**

* **Creditrisk is not the sole driver** of the outcome. The community boost can *override* a lower credit score, while a higher credit score can be *overridden* by the lack of a boost.
* The **impact is systematic**: anyone who does not belong to the “Highland Civic Darts Club” (or any similar community group that might be added later) is at a *structural disadvantage*.
* Because the boost is **binary and fixed (+10)**, it creates a *step function* in the decision surface that is unrelated to the underlying probability of default. This is a classic form of **proxybias** (the proxy = community membership).

### 4.Implications for people lacking community or geographic ties

| Group | Typical outcome in the log | Why they are disadvantaged |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Nonresidents** (e.g., recent movers, migrants, remote workers) | Often lack the “Community” flag and are marked FALSE for LocalResident. | They never receive the +10 boost, so a raw score that is *close* to the approval threshold can tip them into rejection. |
| **People without formal community memberships** (e.g., single adults, people with limited social networks) | Same as above – no boost. | Their “social capital” is penalised even though it has no predictive power for repayment. |
| **Members of other community groups** (not the Highland Darts Club) | No boost (the rule is currently hardcoded to one group). | The model is **unevenly selective** – it favours one specific organization, creating a *groupspecific* advantage. |
| **Minority or underrepresented neighborhoods** (if the “Highland” area correlates with a particular ethnicity or socioeconomic status) | May be underserved because the boost is tied to a *single* local club. | The system could unintentionally **reinforce existing segregation** and violate fairlending regulations. |

Even when two applicants have **identical creditrisk profiles** (e.g., raw scores of 710 vs 715), the presence or absence of a community affiliation can be the decisive factor. This is precisely the kind of **disparate impact** that regulators (e.g., ECOA, Fair Credit Reporting Act, GDPR’s “fair processing” provisions) scrutinise.

### 5.How to surface and quantify the bias

| Step | What to do | Expected insight |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **1. Descriptive audit** | Compute approval rates by *CommunityGroup* and *LocalResident* status. | Likely to show a higher approval rate for “Highland Civic Darts Club” members. |
| **2. Counterfactual analysis** | For each approved case with a boost, simulate the decision *without* the boost. | Many cases (e.g., C001, C004) would flip to rejection, confirming the boost’s decisive role. |
| **3. Statistical tests** | Use chisquare or Fisher’s exact test to assess whether the difference in approval rates between “Community = Yes” vs “No” is statistically significant. | Expect a low pvalue  strong evidence of disparate impact. |
| **4. Fairrisk metrics** | Compute *disparate impact ratio* (approval rate for groupA ÷ approval rate for groupB) and *equalopportunity* (truepositive rate) for each protected attribute. | A ratio <0.8 for “noncommunity” would flag a violation of the 80% rule. |
| **5. Featureimportance audit** | Examine the scoring engine’s feature weights (if available) or use SHAP/LIME on a surrogate model. | The “Community” feature will have a disproportionately high positive contribution relative to its predictive power. |

### 6.Mitigation strategies

| Strategy | How it addresses the bias | Practical considerations |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Remove the communityaffiliation variable** from the scoring engine. | Eliminates the direct +10 boost, forcing the model to rely on riskbased features. | Must verify that the variable is not a strong predictor of default; if it is, replace it with a *riskadjusted* proxy (e.g., neighbourhoodlevel creditrisk statistics). |
| **Replace the binary boost with a calibrated risk factor** (e.g., a small, datadriven adjustment based on historic repayment performance of the group). | Keeps any legitimate signal but prevents an arbitrary jump. | Requires sufficient historical data to estimate the true incremental predictive value. |
| **Apply fairness constraints** (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds) during model training or postprocessing. | Guarantees that the final decision distribution is balanced across protected attributes. | May reduce overall predictive accuracy; need to negotiate tradeoffs with business stakeholders. |
| **Introduce a “soft” community score** that is *continuous* and *explainable* (e.g., number of local references, length of residence). | Provides a nuanced view rather than a binary “yes/no” award. | Must be validated to ensure it does not reintroduce proxy bias. |
| **Regular impact monitoring** (monthly or quarterly) with a dashboard that flags any drift in approval rates by community or geography. | Early detection of unintended bias reemergence. | Requires datapipeline and governance resources. |
| **Transparent documentation** (model card, data sheet) that explicitly lists “CommunityGroup” as a *sensitive* feature and states the rationale for its inclusion/exclusion. | Increases accountability and eases regulator review. | Should be part of the organization’s modelrisk management framework. |

### 7.Bottom line

- **Bias is present** in the form of a **fixed +10 point boost** for members of a specific local community group.  
- The boost **disproportionately benefits** **local residents** who belong to that group, while **penalising** otherwise equally creditworthy applicants who lack the affiliation.  
- The **decision threshold** combined with the boost creates a **stepfunction** that can turn a borderlinerisk applicant into an approved loan, and a slightly higherrisk applicant into a rejection—purely based on socialcapital signals.  
- **Fairness and equity** are compromised: the system yields **disparate impact** against nonresidents, people without formal community ties, and potentially protected demographic groups whose residence patterns differ from the “Highland” area.  
- **Mitigation** should start with **removing or reweighting** the communityaffiliation variable, followed by **fairimpact testing**, **continuous monitoring**, and **transparent documentation**.

By addressing the communitybonus as a proxy bias and aligning the scoring engine strictly with creditrisk predictors, the organization can move toward a **more equitable lending process** while still maintaining predictive performance.
