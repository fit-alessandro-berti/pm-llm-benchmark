Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects offers several key benefits, but also comes with some challenges:

Benefits:

1. Improved scalability: Decomposition allows for handling much larger datasets by breaking them into manageable subprocesses or subproblems.

2. Increased performance: Analyzing smaller components often leads to faster processing times and more efficient resource utilization.

3. Better focus: Decomposition enables analysts to concentrate on specific parts of a process, potentially uncovering insights that might be obscured in a full-scale analysis.

4. Parallel processing: Decomposed components can often be analyzed concurrently, speeding up the overall mining process.

5. Simplified complexity: Breaking down a large process into smaller parts can make it easier to understand and manage the analysis.

Challenges:

1. Maintaining context: Ensuring that insights gained from individual components remain relevant and accurate when reassembled into the larger process view.

2. Choosing appropriate decomposition methods: Selecting the right strategy to divide the process without losing critical interdependencies or flow.

3. Consistency across subprocesses: Ensuring that analysis techniques and parameters are consistently applied across all decomposed parts.

4. Reintegration complexity: Combining results from separate analyses back into a cohesive whole can be challenging and time-consuming.

5. Potential loss of global patterns: Some overarching process patterns or rare events might be missed when focusing on individual components.

6. Increased coordination overhead: Managing multiple subprojects and ensuring alignment between different teams or analysts working on decomposed parts.
