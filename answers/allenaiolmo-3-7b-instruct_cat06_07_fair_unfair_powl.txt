Certainly! Below are two POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) models based on the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process described. The difference lies in how the cultural fit and community affiliation are handled: **Model 1** introduces bias via an XOR choice with a special branch for community-affiliated applicants, while **Model 2** ensures fairness by removing such preferential treatment and having a uniform process for all.

---

## **Model 1: POWL with Potential Unfairness (Biased Process)**

This model reflects the process where, after the skill assessment, there's an XOR choice between a standard cultural fit evaluation and a special "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that gives a subtle advantage to applicants with local affiliations.

### **Model Structure (Description + POWL Code)**

#### **Activities (Nodes)**
- ReceiveApplication
- DataCompletenessCheck (loop, can request more info)
- SkillAssessment
- CulturalFitStandard
- CommunityAffiliationCheck (XOR branch, gives advantage if local/community member)
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

#### **Control Flow**
- Applications go through ReceiveApplication  DataCompletenessCheck (loop)  SkillAssessment (must pass threshold to proceed)
    - If skill assessment passes:
        - XOR choice: either CulturalFitStandard or CommunityAffiliationCheck
            - If CommunityAffiliationCheck and applicant is affiliated  slight advantage (implied by reviewer scoring)
        - Whichever path passes, proceeds to ManagerialReview
            - Then FinalDecision
    - If skill assessment fails  rejected (not modeled explicitly for brevity)

#### **POWL Construction (Python-like pseudocode using pm4py API)**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

# Main activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")  # May loop via operator
SkillAssessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitStandard = Transition("CulturalFitStandard")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition("ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition("FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness (represented as a loop operator)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, 
                          children=[ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck])

# Skill assessment must pass (assume this is implicitly enforced before branching)
# (In real model, you might have a condition, but POWL is structural; assume only those past threshold proceed)

# XOR between standard and community check
cultural_or_affiliation = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, 
                                       children=[CulturalFitStandard, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# After assessment and one of the two checks, managerial review and final decision
review_and_decision = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.PARALLEL,  # ManagerialReview and FinalDecision can be parallel or in order
                                 children=[ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])  # Assume FinalDecision depends on ManagerialReview

# Overall process: Loop for data, then SkillAssessment, then XOR, then Review/Decision
# StrictPartialOrder enforces execution order
process_order = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        data_loop,   # Must complete before proceeding
        SkillAssessment,
        cultural_or_affiliation,
        review_and_decision
    ]
    # Add order constraints as per process (DataCompletenessCheck loop must finish before skill, which must finish before checks, etc.)
    # For simplicity, we establish the left-to-right order via the partial order (assuming proper sequencing is enforced by the organization)
)

# In practice, the partial order would encode the dependencies:
# data_loop -> SkillAssessment -> cultural_or_affiliation -> review_and_decision
# (Implement via .order.add_edge() if using detailed edges)

# For a minimal working example, we just define the order as linear
```

**Key Bias Point:**  
The `Operator.XOR` with `CommunityAffiliationCheck` means that certain applicants can bypass the standard evaluation via a special path, potentially with a positive bias. The reviewer's evaluation in this branch may unconsciously favor local or community-affiliated applicants, introducing unfairness.

## **Model 2: POWL with Fair Process (No Preferential Treatment)**

This model removes the preferential branch. All applicants who pass the skill assessment go through the **same** CulturalFit evaluation, with no special branch for community affiliation or local ties.

### **Model Structure (Description + POWL Code)**

#### **Activities (Nodes)**
- Same as above, but without CommunityAffiliationCheck
    - ReceiveApplication
    - DataCompletenessCheck (loop)
    - SkillAssessment
    - CulturalFitFair  # Single, universal cultural fit check for all
    - ManagerialReview
    - FinalDecision

#### **Control Flow**
- Same data completeness loop
- SkillAssessment  CulturalFitFair (no XOR, just sequential or parallel)
    - Then ManagerialReview  FinalDecision

#### **POWL Construction (Python-like pseudocode)**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

ReceiveApplication = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
SkillAssessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitFair = Transition("CulturalFitFair")  # Standard, equal process for all
ManagerialReview = Transition("ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition("FinalDecision")

data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck])

skill_check = SkillAssessment  # Proceed only if passed (not modeled as condition)

# After skill check, all go to CulturalFitFair (no XOR, so all use same path)
cultural_and_review = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.PARALLEL,
                                   children=[CulturalFitFair, ManagerialReview])
# ManagerialReview must precede FinalDecision
final_chain = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.ORDERED,  # or just use order
                          children=[cultural_and_review, FinalDecision])

process_order = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[data_loop, SkillAssessment, cultural_and_review, final_chain]
)
```

**Key Fairness Point:**  
There is **no XOR or special branch** for community affiliation. CulturalFitFair is the same for all eligible applicants, so the process is strictly merit-based (as far as the workflow is concerned). Any human bias during ManagerialReview still exists, but it is not algorithmically or structurally biased based on affiliation.

## **How to Use These Models**

You can instantiate these in `pm4py` as process models and analyze them for potential bias using metrics such as fairness-aware performance analysis, or use them as templates for process mining analysis to detect where structural bias may emerge.
