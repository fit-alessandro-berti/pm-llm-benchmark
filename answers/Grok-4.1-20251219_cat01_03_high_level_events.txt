### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

Based on the consistent pattern observed in the provided event log samples (for cases A1 and B2), the manufacturing process can be abstracted into **four coherent high-level activities**. These groupings are derived from:

- **Temporal proximity**: Events within each group occur consecutively without significant gaps.
- **Logical sequence**: Events follow a clear functional progression (preparation → main processing → post-processing → verification).
- **Resource patterns**: Shifts in primary resources or resource types often mark transitions between phases.
- **Functional coherence**: Events contribute to a single overarching goal in the manufacturing workflow.

#### 1. Material Loading and Preparation
**Included low-level events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale for grouping:**
These events represent the initial setup phase where the raw material is brought into the workstation, identified, positioned, and conditioned for processing. They are all preparatory actions focused on getting the metal sheet ready for modification. The resource shifts from manual operator handling (retrieval, scanning, placement) to robotic/automated assistance (alignment) and heating equipment (preheating), but all serve the same goal of material readiness. This phase ends when preheating is complete, as the next events involve tool pickup for active assembly.

**Proposed name:** **Material Loading and Preparation**

#### 2. Welding Assembly
**Included low-level events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale for grouping:**
This is the core manufacturing/assembly phase where the primary value-adding transformation occurs: joining parts via welding. Picking up the tool is a direct prerequisite, and immediate weld integrity measurement is an integral part of the welding operation (likely an automated in-line check to verify the welds before proceeding). All events are tightly coupled temporally and functionally, performed primarily by Operator B and the Quality Sensor immediately after welding. The phase transitions when welding and its direct verification are complete.

**Proposed name:** **Welding Assembly**

#### 3. Protective Coating Application
**Included low-level events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale for grouping:**
These events form a distinct post-assembly treatment phase aimed at protecting the welded product. Coating application and drying are sequential steps using dedicated coating and heating equipment, occurring immediately after weld verification. They represent a separate finishing subprocess that modifies the surface properties of the now-assembled item, rather than its structure.

**Proposed name:** **Protective Coating Application**

#### 4. Final Quality Inspection
**Included low-level events:**
- Visual check

**Rationale for grouping:**
This is the final verification step performed manually by a quality operator after all automated/mechanical processing is complete. It serves as an independent pass/fail gate before the product is released from the workstation. It is isolated as a separate high-level step because it occurs after all modification phases and involves human judgment rather than automated processing.

**Proposed name:** **Final Quality Inspection**

### Summary of the High-Level Process Model

For any case in the log, the manufacturing workflow can be abstracted as the following sequence of high-level activities:

1. **Material Loading and Preparation**  
   (Retrieve → Scan → Place → Align → Preheat)
2. **Welding Assembly**  
   (Pick tool → Weld corners → Measure integrity)
3. **Protective Coating Application**  
   (Apply coating → Dry coating)
4. **Final Quality Inspection**  
   (Visual check)

This abstraction reduces the granularity from 12–13 low-level events per case to just **4 meaningful high-level stages**, making the overall process flow much easier to analyze, monitor, and optimize while preserving the logical and temporal structure of the manufacturing workflow.
