Alright, I need to create two POWL models based on the described hiring process of GlobalTeq Solutions. The first model should include potential unfairness by incorporating an XOR branching that gives a subtle advantage to applicants with local community affiliations. The second model should eliminate this unfairness by ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process without any selective advantages.

First, let's understand the stages of the hiring process:
1. **ReceiveApplication**: Applicants submit their resumes and detailed questionnaires.
2. **DataCompletenessCheck**: The system checks for missing information and prompts for additional details if necessary.
3. **SkillAssessment**: Applicants take online skill tests.
4. **CulturalFitCheck**: Standard evaluation of cultural alignment.
5. **CommunityAffiliationCheck**: Additional evaluation if the applicant is affiliated with a local group.
6. **ManagerialReview**: Final decision made by a hiring manager based on previous evaluations.

In the **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**, after the SkillAssessment, there's an XOR choice between a standard CulturalFitCheck and a CommunityAffiliationCheck that gives a slight advantage to those with local affiliations. This introduces a biased path that can unfairly favor certain applicants.

In the **POWL Model Without Unfairness**, the process remains the same, but there's no XOR branching based on community affiliations. All applicants proceed through the standard CulturalFitCheck, eliminating any selective advantages.

I'll need to represent these flows using the POWL syntax, ensuring that the first model includes the XOR branching for potential bias and the second model excludes it to maintain fairness.
