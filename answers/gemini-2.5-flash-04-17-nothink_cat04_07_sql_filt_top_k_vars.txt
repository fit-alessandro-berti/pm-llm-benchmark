**Explanation:**

1. **`CaseActivitySequence` CTE:**
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id`.
   - `LIST(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` aggregates the `activity` column into a list within each `case_id` group. The `ORDER BY timestamp` ensures that the activities are listed in the chronological order they occurred.

2. **`ProcessVariantCounts` CTE:**
   - This CTE identifies the unique process variants and counts their occurrences.
   - It groups the results from `CaseActivitySequence` by the `activity_sequence`.
   - `COUNT(case_id)` counts how many cases have each specific activity sequence, giving the variant frequency.
   - `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(case_id) DESC)` assigns a rank to each variant based on its frequency in descending order (highest frequency gets rank 1).

3. **`TopKVars` CTE:**
   - This CTE filters the `ProcessVariantCounts` to select the `activity_sequence` of the top K variants.
   - You need to replace `10` in `WHERE variant_rank <= 10` with the desired value of K (e.g., 5 for the top 5 variants).

4. **Final SELECT Statement:**
   - This is the main query that retrieves the original event data.
   - It joins the `event_log` table (`e`) with `CaseActivitySequence` (`cas`) on `case_id` to link events to their case's activity sequence.
   - It then joins with `TopKVars` (`tkv`) on `activity_sequence`. This ensures that only events from cases whose activity sequence matches one of the top K variants are included in the final result.
   - `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` orders the final result for readability, presenting events within each case in chronological order.

**To use this query:**

1. Make sure you have a DuckDB database and a table named `event_log` with the specified columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`).
2. Replace `10` in the `WHERE variant_rank <= 10` clause with the actual number of top variants you want to retrieve (your K value).
3. Execute the SQL query in your DuckDB environment.
