Given the structured nature of your prompt, I'll analyze the event log provided according to the normative process described.

**Case 1:**

- **Violation Explanation:**  
  *Receive order* at 09:00  
  *Check inventory* at 10:00  
  *Authorize payment* at 11:00  
  *Package items* at 12:00  
  *Ship order* at 13:00  
  *Close order* at 14:00  

**Analysis:** This case violates the normative process as it authorizes payment before checking inventory (the "Authorize payment" step occurs before "Check inventory"). According to the process description, "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" to ensure that inventory sufficiency is known. Therefore, this sequence deviates from the intended flow because payment authorization is not properly conditioned on the inventory check.

**Case 2:**

- **Violation Explanation:**  
  *Receive order* at 2023-10-06 09:00  
  *Check inventory* at 2023-10-06 09:30  
  *Package items* at 2023-10-06 10:00  
  *Authorize payment* at 2023-10-06 10:30  
  *Ship order* at 2023-10-06 11:00  
  *Close order* at 2023-10-06 11:30  

**Analysis:** This case violates the normative process in two steps:
  * *Package items* occurs before *Authorize payment*. According to the text, "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" since payment authorization ensures that there are sufficient funds and thus confirms the legitimacy of packaging the items for shipment.
  * *Ship order* occurs after a *Cancel order*. The process explicitly states that shipping should never happen after a cancellation. This is an egregious violation as it directly contradicts the normative flow where "Cancel order" must follow "Check inventory" and precede "Close order."

**Case 3:**

- **Violation Explanation:**  
  *Receive order* at 2023-10-07 09:00  
  *Check inventory* at 2023-10-07 09:40  
  *Authorize payment* at 2023-10-07 10:00  
  *Cancel order* at 2023-10-07 10:30  
  *Ship order* at 2023-10-07 10:30  
  *Close order* at 2023-10-07 11:00  

**Analysis:** This case violates the normative process in several steps:
  * *Cancel order* occurs before *Check inventory*. The process explicitly states that "Cancel order" should occur after "Check inventory," which ensures that an informed decision to cancel is made based on inventory status.
  * *Ship order* and *Close order* both occur after a *Cancel order*. The normative flow strictly prohibits shipping and closing orders after cancellations since these actions are unrelated and illogically placed in the sequence following a cancellation.

**Case 4:**

- **Violation Explanation:**  
  *Receive order* at 2023-10-08 09:00  
  *Check inventory* at 2023-10-08 09:20  
  *Cancel order* at 2023-10-08 09:50  
  *Close order* at 2023-10-08 09:50  

**Analysis:** This case violates the normative process in two steps:
  * *Cancel order* occurs before *Check inventory*. Similar to Case 3, the cancellation should only occur after checking inventory to ensure that it's based on a current stock status.
  * *Close order* and *Cancel order* occur at the same timestamp (09:50). Although technically following the chronological sequence, it implies an incorrect handling of the process where "Cancel order" is immediately followed by "Close order," which does not adhere to the expected flow where "Close order" should be the final activity after all other steps are completed.

**Case 5:**

- **Violation Explanation:**  
  *Receive order* at 2023-10-09 09:00  
  *Check inventory* at 2023-10-09 10:00  
  *Authorize payment* at 2023-10-09 10:30  
  *Ship order* at 2023-10-09 11:00  
  *Close order* at 2023-10-09 11:30  

**Analysis:** This case does not appear to violate the normative process as described. Each activity follows the intended sequence:
  * The *Receive order* is correctly followed by a *Check inventory*.
  * *Authorize payment* occurs after the inventory check, ensuring that inventory sufficiency is known before proceeding with payment authorization.
  * *Package items* precedes *Ship order*, and *Ship order* is followed by *Close order*, adhering to the sequence: Receive > Check Inventory > Authorize Payment > Package > Ship > Close.

In conclusion:
- Case 1 violates the process by authorizing payment before checking inventory.
- Case 2 violates the process twice, once by packaging items before authorizing payment and once by shipping after canceling an order.
- Case 3 violates the process by cancelling an order before checking inventory and then incorrectly shipping and closing the order following cancellation.
- Case 4 violates the process by cancelling an order before checking inventory and incorrectly closing the order simultaneously with the cancellation.
- Case 5 follows the intended normative process.
