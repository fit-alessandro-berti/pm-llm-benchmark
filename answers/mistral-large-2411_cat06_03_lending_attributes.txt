In the context of process mining and fairness analysis, sensitive attributes are those that can potentially introduce bias or unfairness into the process outcomes. These attributes often relate to demographic characteristics or other factors that should not influence the decision-making process. Based on the provided attributes, the following are likely to be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen (True) or not (False). Citizenship status can be a sensitive attribute because it may lead to unfair treatment if loan decisions are influenced by whether an applicant is a citizen or not.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the applicant (True or False, presumably representing male and female). Gender is a commonly recognized sensitive attribute because loan decisions should not be biased based on the applicant's gender.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a German speaker (True) or not (False). Language or national origin can be sensitive attributes because they may lead to unfair treatment if loan decisions are influenced by the applicant's linguistic background.

These attributes are sensitive because they pertain to characteristics that are protected under anti-discrimination laws and policies in many jurisdictions. Ensuring fairness in the loan application process would involve checking that these attributes do not unfairly influence the outcomes, such as loan approval or denial.

Other attributes, such as **activity**, **concept:name**, **resource**, **start_timestamp**, **time**, and **time:timestamp**, are generally not considered sensitive for fairness. They relate to the operational aspects of the process rather than demographic characteristics of the applicants.

In summary, the sensitive attributes for fairness in this context are **case:citizen**, **case:gender**, and **case:german speaking**.
