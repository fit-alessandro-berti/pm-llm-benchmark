 When comparing the process variants between the protected and unprotected groups, we can identify several differences that may indicate unfair treatment or disparities in the loan application process. Here are the main differences based on the provided data:

1. **Frequency of Denials without Full Examination**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of early denials (Application Rejected and Appointment Denied) compared to the unprotected group. This suggests that the protected group's applications are more likely to be rejected without a full examination of their credit application.

2. **Additional Requirements**:
   - The protected group seems to face more additional requirements, such as requests for co-signers and multiple visits to assess collateral. For example, variants that include "Request Co-Signer On Loan" and multiple "Make Visit to Assess Colatteral" steps are more frequent and have higher performance times in the protected group.

3. **Loan Denial Rates**:
   - Even after complying with additional requirements such as co-signing and collateral assessment, the protected group still faces a higher rate of loan denials. This is evident from the numerous variants ending with "Loan Denied" in the protected group.

4. **Performance Times**:
   - The performance times for similar process variants are generally longer for the protected group. This could indicate that the protected group experiences more delays in the process, which might be due to additional scrutiny or bureaucratic hurdles.

5. **Skipped Examination**:
   - There is a process variant for the unprotected group that includes a "skipped_examination" step followed by "Sign Loan Agreement," which does not appear in the protected group's variants. This suggests that some applications from the unprotected group are approved without a full examination, a variant that is not observed in the protected group.

6. **Success Rates**:
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants ending with "Sign Loan Agreement," indicating a higher success rate in obtaining loans compared to the protected group.

7. **Differences in Process Flow**:
   - The unprotected group has fewer steps leading to loan approval or denial, suggesting a more streamlined process. In contrast, the protected group often has to go through more steps, such as multiple visits for collateral
