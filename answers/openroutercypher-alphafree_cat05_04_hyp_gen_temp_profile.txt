### Identification of Anomalies

Here are the anomalies identified in the temporal profile model:

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
   - Average time: ~25 hours
   - Standard Deviation: 1 hour (unusually low)
   
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
   - Average time: 7 days
   - Standard Deviation: 2 days (relatively high)

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
   - Average time: 2 hours (unusually short)
   
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
   - Average time: 5 minutes (unusually short)

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

**R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
- The rigid schedule for approval suggests a forced compliance to a particular turnaround time. Possible reasons include:
  - An automated system enforcing fixed approval deadlines.
  - Claims are being prematurely approved without thorough evaluation.

**P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
- Long waiting times could indicate backlogs or resource constraints. Possible reasons:
  - Administrative bottlenecks leading to delays in notifying customers.
  - Inconsistent resource allocation where some claims are delayed while others proceed rapidly.

**A to C (Assign to Close)**:
- The unusually quick closure suggests premature actions. Potential causes include:
  - Claims being closed prematurely before completing necessary steps.
  - Misclassification of claim statuses due to manual errors.

**E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
- An extremely quick transition might indicate a bypassing of steps or erroneous tracking. Possible reasons:
  - Automated notifications sent immediately after evaluation without manual checks.
  - Intermediate steps being omitted inadvertently.

### Verification Approaches using SQL Queries

**Check Anomalies in R to P (Receive to Approve):**
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id, 
    ce1.activity AS activity1, 
    ce1.timestamp AS time1, 
    ce2.activity AS activity2, 
    ce2.timestamp AS time2, 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'R' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'P' 
    AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
HAVING 
    time_diff_seconds < 72000   -- much less than ~25 hours
    OR (time_diff_seconds BETWEEN 72000 AND 108000);  -- close to ~25 hours with very limited deviation
```

**Identify Long Wait Times in P to N (Approve to Notify):**
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id, 
    ce1.activity AS activity1, 
    ce1.timestamp AS time1, 
    ce2.activity AS activity2, 
    ce2.timestamp AS time2, 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'P' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'N' 
    AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
HAVING 
    time_diff_seconds > 864000  -- more than expected 10 days
```

**Examine Quick Closures in A to C (Assign to Close):**
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id, 
    ce1.activity AS activity1, 
    ce1.timestamp AS time1, 
    ce2.activity AS activity2, 
    ce2.timestamp AS time2, 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'A' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'C' 
    AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
HAVING 
    time_diff_seconds < 10800;  -- less than 3 hours
```

**Investigate Rapid E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
```sql
SELECT 
    ce1.claim_id, 
    ce1.activity AS activity1, 
    ce1.timestamp AS time1, 
    ce2.activity AS activity2, 
    ce2.timestamp AS time2, 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events ce1
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'E' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'N' 
    AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
HAVING 
    time_diff_seconds < 180;  -- less than 3 minutes
```

**Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters and Claim Types:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_type, 
    a.name AS adjuster_name, 
    ce1.claim_id, 
    ce1.activity AS activity1, 
    ce1.timestamp AS time1, 
    ce2.activity AS activity2, 
    ce2.timestamp AS time2, 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM 
    claims c
JOIN 
    claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
JOIN 
    claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters a ON c.claim_id = ce1.resource::INTEGER
WHERE 
    ce1.activity = 'R' 
    AND ce2.activity = 'P' 
    AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp 
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) < 72000
    OR (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) BETWEEN 72000 AND 108000)
```

These queries help investigate and correlate anomalies with specific adjusters and claim types, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of temporal discrepancies described in the temporal profile model. Adjust these queries as needed according to specific table schemas and additional context available in your database.
