### **Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process**

---

## **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times**

We begin by calculating the **total resolution time** for each case — that is, the time from the **first event ("Receive Ticket")** to the **last event ("Close Ticket")**.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Resolution Times**

| Case ID | Receive Ticket | Close Ticket | Total Resolution Time |
|---------|------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00 | 2024-03-01 10:15 | **2 hours 15 min** |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05 | 2024-03-02 09:15 | **25 hours 10 min** |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10 | 2024-03-01 09:30 | **1 hour 20 min** |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20 | 2024-03-02 08:30 | **24 hours 10 min** |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25 | 2024-03-03 09:30 | **41 hours 5 min** |

---

### **Step 2: Identify Long Cases**

Let’s define **"significantly longer than average"** as **more than 2 standard deviations above the mean**, or simply **visually inspect for outliers**.

- **Average resolution time**  **(2h15m + 25h10m + 1h20m + 24h10m + 41h5m) / 5  18.9 hours**
- **Cases above 20 hours:** 102 (25h10m), 104 (24h10m), and **105 (41h5m)**.

 **Cases 102, 104, and 105** are **significantly longer** than the rest.

---

## **2. Determine Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues**

Let’s examine each of these long cases in detail.

---

### **Case 102: 25 hours 10 minutes**

**timeline:**
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:00
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 2024-03-01 11:30
- Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 14:00
- Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:00
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15

**Delays Observed:**
- **2.5 hours** from assignment to escalation.
- **2.5 hours** from escalation to investigation (11:30  14:00).
- Investigation started **6 hours after business day start** on March 1st.

**Root Causes:**
- **Escalation introduced delay** — ticket had to wait for Level-2 availability.
- **Investigate Issue** happened **late in the day**, possibly due to agent unavailability or prioritization.
- **Resolve Ticket** only happened **next morning**, indicating lack of urgency or overnight handoff.

---

### **Case 104: 24 hours 10 minutes**

**timeline:**
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:30
- Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 13:00
- Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:00
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30

**Delays Observed:**
- **~4 hours** from assignment to investigation.
- Investigation started **late in the day** (1 PM), leading to resolution **next morning**.

**Root Causes:**
- **Long wait between assignment and investigation** — possibly due to agent unavailability or low priority.
- **Late-day investigation** led to resolution being delayed until the next business day.

---

### **Case 105: 41 hours 5 minutes** *(Worst Performer)*

**timeline:**
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:00
- Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 09:10
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 2024-03-01 10:00
- Investigate Issue (Level-2): 2024-03-02 14:00
- Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:00
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30

**Delays Observed:**
- **1 hour** from assignment to first investigation.
- **17 hours** from escalation to **next investigation** (10:00 on March 1  14:00 on March 2!).
- Resolution didn’t happen until **next day morning**.

**Root Causes:**
- **Escalation caused a major delay** — Level-2 agent didn’t start work **until the next day afternoon**.
- **No progress** on the ticket from **March 1 10:00 to March 2 14:00** — a full **28 hours idle**.
- Likely **lack of SLA enforcement**, **resource constraints**, or **miscommunication** in handoff.

## **3. Insights, Recommendations, and Bottlenecks**

---

### **Key Bottlenecks Identified**

| Bottleneck | Impact | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Escalation Delays** | Adds hours to days of delay | Cases 102, 105 show long wait before Level-2 picks up |
| **Late-Day Investigations** | Delays resolution to next day | Cases 102, 104 |
| **Idle Time Between Assignment and Investigation** | Wasted time, low productivity | Cases 102, 104, 105 |
| **Lack of Urgency / Prioritization** | Tickets sit unprocessed for long periods | Case 105 had 28-hour idle time |

---

### **Recommendations to Improve Performance**

#### **1. Implement Escalation SLAs**
- Define **maximum time allowed for escalation** (e.g., 2 hours).
- Automate **escalation alerts** to Level-2 team to reduce handoff delays.
- Track escalation wait times and hold accountabilities.

#### **2. Stagger Work Shifts or Extend Support Hours**
- To avoid **late-day bottlenecks**, consider:
  - **Shift handoffs** with overlap.
  - **Extended support hours** for high-priority tickets.
  - **On-call escalation support** for critical issues.

#### **3. Improve Ticket Prioritization**
- Use **riority scoring** (e.g., impact + urgency) to ensure:
  - High-priority tickets are **assigned and investigated ASAP**.
  - Low-priority tickets don’t block others.

#### **4. Reduce Idle Time Between Assignment and Investigation**
- Monitor **time-to-first-action** metrics.
- Set **internal SLAs** for agents to start investigation within **30–60 minutes** of assignment.
- Use **automated reminders** or **supervisor alerts** if delay exceeds threshold.

#### **5. Provide Real-Time Visibility and Handoff Protocols**
- Ensure **clear handoff documentation** when escalating.
- Use **shared dashboards** to track ticket status across teams.
- Conduct **regular handoff meetings** to align Level-1 and Level-2 teams.

#### **6. Analyze Ticket Complexity Before Escalation**
- Implement a **triage-to-escalation risk assessment**:
  - If issue is likely beyond Level-1 capability, **route directly** to Level-2.
  - Reduce unnecessary **re-routing** and **rework**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **longest-resolution cases (102, 104, 105)** suffer primarily from:
- **Escalation-related delays**.
- **Idle time between assignment and investigation**.
- **Late-day or cross-day handoffs** causing work to pile up.

By **implementing stricter SLAs**, **improving handoff protocols**, and **enhancing visibility and prioritization**, the support team can significantly **reduce resolution times**, **improve customer satisfaction**, and **increase operational efficiency**. 

**Monitoring escalation delays and idle time** will be key KPIs going forward.
