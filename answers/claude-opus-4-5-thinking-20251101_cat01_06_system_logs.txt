## Explanation of Transformation Logic

### Case Identification Strategy

I adopted a **document/artifact-centric approach** to define cases, where each distinct document, email, or file the user works on represents a separate case:

| Case ID | Description | Document/Artifact |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Case_1 | Editing Quarterly Report | Quarterly_Report.docx |
| Case_2 | Creating/Editing Draft Document | Document1.docx |
| Case_3 | Handling Annual Meeting Email | Email - Annual Meeting |
| Case_4 | Reviewing PDF Report | Report_Draft.pdf |
| Case_5 | Updating Budget Spreadsheet | Budget_2024.xlsx |

This approach was chosen because:
- It creates **coherent process instances** that represent logical units of work
- It allows tracking of **complete lifecycle** (open  edit  save  close) for each artifact
- It captures **case interleaving**, which is natural in knowledge work (users switch between tasks)

### Activity Naming Conventions

Raw system actions were translated into **standardized, business-meaningful activities**:

| Raw Action | Context | Standardized Activity |
|------------|---------|----------------------|
| FOCUS | First time on document | Open Document / Open Spreadsheet |
| FOCUS | Returning to document | Resume Document |
| TYPING | Word/Excel | Edit Document / Edit Spreadsheet |
| TYPING | Email | Compose Reply |
| SAVE | Any document | Save Document / Save Spreadsheet |
| CLOSE | Any document | Close Document |
| CLICK (Open Email) | Email | Open Email |
| SCROLL | Email | Read Email |
| SCROLL | PDF | Review Document |
| CLICK (Reply) | Email | Start Reply |
| CLICK (Send) | Email | Send Email |
| HIGHLIGHT | PDF | Annotate Document |
| SWITCH | To previously-opened doc | Resume Document |
| SWITCH | Navigation only | Omitted (transition, not activity) |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **SWITCH events**: Treated as transitions. When switching to a previously-worked document, converted to "Resume Document." Pure navigation switches were omitted as they don't represent meaningful work activities.

2. **Repeated TYPING events**: Kept as separate "Edit" activities to preserve granularity for detailed analysis (e.g., measuring edit frequency or duration patterns).

3. **Case_1 lifecycle**: Shows an interrupted workflow pattern—the user initially opened Quarterly_Report.docx, switched to other work, then returned to complete it. The "Resume Document" activity captures this return.

4. **Case_2 lifecycle**: Demonstrates multi-phase editing with an interruption—initial draft, save, work on other tasks, then resume to add budget references before final save and close.

### Process Narratives by Case

- **Case_1**: Quarterly report opened briefly  interrupted  resumed  edited  saved  closed
- **Case_2**: New document created  drafted  saved  (interrupted)  resumed  added references  saved  closed
- **Case_3**: Email opened  read  reply initiated  composed  sent (complete email handling cycle)
- **Case_4**: PDF opened  reviewed  key findings highlighted (document review workflow)
- **Case_5**: Spreadsheet opened  Q1 figures updated  Q2 row added  saved (budget update task)
