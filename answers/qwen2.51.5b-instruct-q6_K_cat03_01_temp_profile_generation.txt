Certainly! Below is an example of how you could generate a temporal profile dictionary for a hypothetical "Purchase-to-Pay" (P2P) process. This data can be used to populate a **temporal** model describing the average and standard deviation of time delays between activities involved in the P2P processes:

```python
import random

class TemporalProfile:
    def __init__(self, activity_pairs):
        self.profile = {}

        for act1, act2 in activity_pairs:
            # Assuming a simplified scenario where we have 4 key-value pairs for each activity pair
            profiles = [ 
                {'AVG': None, 'STDDEV': random.randint(3600, 86400)}, 
                {'AVG': None, 'STDDEV': random.uniform(3600, 86400)},  
                {'AVG': None, 'STDDEV': random.gauss(3600, 1800)},
            ] * 2
            
            # The profiles array is duplicated to represent possible variations
            self.profile[(act1, act2)] = profiles

    def get_avg_and_stddev(self):
        return self.profile


# Initialize a temporal profile model for the P2P process with random profiles for simplicity and variability.
temporal_profile = TemporalProfile([('Purchase', 'Order'), 
                                    ('Order', 'Invoice'),  
                                    ('Invoice', 'Payment'),
                                    ('Payment','Close')])
```

### Explanation:
- **activity_pairs**: This is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the activities that need to be tracked for delays.
  
  - `temporal_profile.activity_pairs = [('Purchase', 'Order'), ('Order', 'Invoice'), ('Invoice', 'Payment'), ('Payment','Close')]`
  
    Here, we have four activities in total (Purchase -> Order, Order -> Invoice, Invoice -> Payment, and finally, Payment -> Close).
    
- **profile**: This is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents the average time and its standard deviation for delays between two given activities. The size `N` has been set to 2 as suggested.
  
    This ensures variability: N repeated instances per activity pair gives you multiple possible intervals, reflecting real-world business processes are often more volatile.

- **TemporalProfile class**: A simple class that initializes the temporal profile based on the provided pairs of activities and randomizes the values for average time (AVG) and standard deviations (STDDEV).

If you want to get specific averages and std deviations from this `temporal_profile`, simply call:

```python
print(temporal_profile.get_avg_and_stddev())
```

This will give you a tuple `(a, b)` where:
- `a` is the total average time between two activities.
- `b` is the standard deviation of those times.

For more detailed usage and additional scenarios (like handling different types of delays or adding constraints), I'd advise consulting real business data from typical "Purchase-to-Pay" processes. This allows better customization and precision in your model.
