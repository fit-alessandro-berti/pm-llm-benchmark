Comparing the event logs from Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group), there appears to be bias present in the processing of applications from Group B. This bias manifests in the following ways:

1. Community Group Boost: In the event log for Group B, applicants who are part of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a score adjustment of +10 points, referred to as a "Community Boost." This boost is not applied to applicants in Group A, who have no community group affiliation. The presence of this score adjustment systematically favors applicants from the specific community group in Group B.

2. Impact on Final Decisions: The community group boost in Group B's log directly influences the final decisions. In cases U001 and U003, the applicants' preliminary scores were below the assumed approval threshold of 720. However, with the addition of the +10 community boost, their adjusted scores reached 730 and 705, respectively, resulting in their applications being approved. In contrast, applicant U002 from Group B, who had no community affiliation, was rejected with a score of 710. This suggests that the community boost is a deciding factor in the approval process.

3. Disparate Treatment: The event log for Group A shows consistent treatment of all applicants, with no score adjustments based on local residency or community group affiliation. The preliminary scores directly translate to the final decisions without any modifications. However, in Group B, the presence of the "LocalResident" attribute and "CommunityGroup" affiliation leads to disparate treatment, with certain applicants receiving favorable score adjustments.

The bias in Group B's log favors applicants who are local residents and members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club." This bias systematically advantages these applicants, increasing their chances of approval compared to those without such affiliations. The absence of similar adjustments in Group A's log highlights the disparate treatment between the two groups.

It is important to note that the bias observed in Group B's log may be unintentional or the result of a specific policy. However, it raises concerns about fairness and equal treatment in the application process. The influence of factors like local residency and community group affiliation should be carefully examined to ensure that all applicants, regardless of their background, are evaluated based on objective criteria and merit.

To mitigate this bias, it would be necessary to review and revise the scoring and decision-making processes to ensure consistent treatment across all applicants, regardless of their group affiliations. The criteria for score adjustments, if any, should be clearly defined, justified, and applied uniformly to prevent systematic disadvantages for certain groups of applicants.
