Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performances, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
   - The unprotected group has significantly higher frequencies for most process variants compared to the protected group. This suggests that the unprotected group is more likely to undergo complex and varied treatment processes.
   - For instance, the frequency of the variant "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" is 1466 for the unprotected group, compared to 179 for the protected group.

2. **Performance (Execution Time):**
   - The unprotected group generally has higher execution times for the same or similar process variants. This could indicate that the unprotected group's processes take longer to complete, which might be due to increased complexity or fewer resources allocated to their care.
   - For example, the performance of "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" is 320004.432 for the unprotected group and 320008.950 for the protected group.

3. **Process Variants with Treatment Unsuccessful:**
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants that include "Treatment unsuccessful" steps. This suggests that treatments are less likely to be successful for the unprotected group on the first attempt.
   - For instance, the variant "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a frequency of 225 for the unprotected group and 0 for the protected group.

4. **Treatment Success Rates:**
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that end with "Treatment successful -> Discharge." This indicates that the protected group may have higher treatment success rates overall.
   - Conversely, the unprotected group has a higher frequency of variants that include "Treatment unsuccessful" steps before eventually reaching "Treatment successful -> Discharge," suggesting lower initial success rates.

5. **Discharge Without Treatment:**
   - The unprotected group has a process variant "Discharge" with a frequency of 505 and performance of 0.000. This variant is not present in the protected group's list. This could indicate that the unprotected group is more likely to be discharged without receiving any treatment.

These differences suggest potential disparities in the quality and efficiency of care received by the protected and unprotected groups. However, further analysis would be required to determine the underlying causes and implications of these discrepancies.
