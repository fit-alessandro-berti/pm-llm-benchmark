Certainly! Below is a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes your task:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation:
- The **subquery**:
  ```sql
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
  ```
  groups events by `case_id` and filters to keep only those with 6 or fewer events.

- The **outer query** selects all events from `event_log` where the `case_id` is in the result of the subquery — effectively keeping all individual events for qualifying cases.

This ensures that cases with more than six events are excluded entirely, and only full event data for valid cases is returned.
