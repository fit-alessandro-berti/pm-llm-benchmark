1. Normative (strict) violations  

Case 2 is the only one that breaks the hard rules.  
- **Wrong order**: “Risk Assessment” is registered at 08:20 although “Credit Check” was only executed afterwards (09:00).  
   violates “Credit Check must finish before Risk Assessment can start”.  
- **Forbidden action**: although the loan was rejected (09:30), the process still executed “Finalize Documentation” (10:00).  
   violates the rule that documentation is only allowed after an approval.  

Cases 1 and 3 follow the compulsory sequence and the yes/no logic exactly.

2. Deviations from the “nice-to-have” (desiderata)  

- **Case 3**  
  – Timeliness of Credit Check: executed >24 h after “Application Received” (gap  49 h).  
  – Timeliness of notification: applicant informed 75 h after the decision instead of the suggested 48 h.  
  – No “Follow-up Call” is recorded; the guideline recommends one before closing.  

- **Case 1**  
  – Also omits the optional “Follow-up Call”.  
  – However, both the credit-check and the inform steps are well inside the preferred 24 h / 48 h windows, so no timing desideratum is violated.  

- **Case 2**  
  – Again no “Follow-up Call”.  
  – Timing itself is actually fine (credit check and inform inside the recommended windows), but those steps are reached only after the normative violations already occurred.  

3. Possible interpretations / why it might have happened  

- The out-of-order credit check in Case 2 could be a simple logging error (the analyst entered the risk-assessment record before the system had time-stamped the credit check). Nevertheless, as recorded, the trace is formally non-compliant.  

- Finalising documentation after a rejection (Case 2) is harder to justify; it may be an automatic script that triggered on every positive preliminary score and was not rolled back when the final decision became “reject”.  

- The long delays in Case 3 are often seen when an application arrives late on Friday, the credit department works only on business days, and no-one is available to send the letter until the following Monday/Tuesday; still, according to the stated desiderata, those delays are sub-optimal.  

Because only Case 2 infringes the strict rules, it would typically be sent back for re-work or exception approval, whereas Case 3 would merely receive a “please-improve-next-time” note.
