This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram depicting an "Order Fulfillment" process across four main departments or participants, represented as horizontal "Pools": **Sales**, **Production**, **Procurement**, and **Warehouse**.

Here's a detailed description of the process flow within each pool and their interactions:

**Overall Process Initiation:**
The process begins in the **Sales** pool with a "Monday morning" timer event, suggesting a regular review or kickoff of sales activities.

**1. Sales Pool:**
*   **Order Reception and Validation:** The process starts by checking the "order for completeness".
*   **Customer Check and Addition:** It then proceeds to "Check if customer is already in the database".
    *   If the "Customer not in the database" (exclusive gateway), a task to "Add customer to the database" is performed, interacting with a "database" data store.
    *   Regardless of whether the customer was new or existing, the process merges back and proceeds to "Check customer's order".
*   **Order Details Distribution:** After the customer and order checks, "Send order details" is performed. This action sends "Order details" (indicated by dashed message flows) to both the **Production** pool and the **Procurement** pool simultaneously.
*   **Invoice Drafting:** The Sales process waits for the "Product sent" message (an intermediate message catch event) from the **Warehouse** pool. Once this message is received, indicating the product has been shipped, the "Draft invoice" task is performed, concluding the Sales process.

**2. Production Pool:**
*   **Order Receipt:** The Production process is initiated when "Order details arrive" (an intermediate message start event) from the Sales pool.
*   **Planning and Manufacturing:**
    *   Upon receiving order details, a parallel gateway allows the process to immediately "Plan production".
    *   After "Plan production", a complex gateway (represented by a star) is encountered, which merges paths.
    *   The main path proceeds to "Manufacture product".
*   **Material Fault Loop:** If during or after "Manufacture product", the "Material not faulty" condition (an intermediate message catch event) is not met (i.e., material *is* faulty), the flow loops back to "Plan production". This loop suggests a re-planning phase due to faulty materials. It also appears to trigger an action in Procurement, though the explicit message flow is not clearly depicted for the *faulty* condition, only for "Order cancellation".
*   **Product Completion and Communication:** Once the product is successfully manufactured, a "Product complete" message (intermediate message throw event) is sent to the **Warehouse** pool.
*   **Order Cancellation:** The Production process can be interrupted by an "Order cancellation" message (an intermediate message boundary event) received from the **Procurement** pool, which would terminate the ongoing production.

**3. Procurement Pool:**
*   **Order Receipt:** Like Production, the Procurement process is also initiated when "Order details arrive" (an intermediate message start event) from the Sales pool.
*   **Material Compensation Subprocess:** The process immediately enters a collapsed "Material Compensation Subprocess".
    *   Inside this subprocess, "Order materials" is performed.
    *   A loop back from "Return material" to "Order materials" indicates a possibility of material returns and subsequent re-ordering within this subprocess.
*   **Material Check and Cancellation:** After the "Material Compensation Subprocess" completes, the "Check materials" task is performed.
    *   An "Order cancellation" message (intermediate message boundary event) from another process can interrupt "Check materials".
    *   Following "Check materials" (or its interruption), an event-based gateway is used. If an "Order cancellation" event occurs, a message (intermediate message throw event) for "Order cancellation" is sent to the **Production** pool, effectively cancelling the production process. The Procurement process then ends.

**4. Warehouse Pool:**
*   **Product Reception:** The Warehouse process begins when "Product complete" (an intermediate message start event) is received from the **Production** pool.
*   **Product Shipment:** The "Send product" task is performed.
*   **Shipment Confirmation:** After sending the product, a "Product sent" message (an intermediate message throw event) is sent back to the **Sales** pool, completing the Warehouse's role in the process.

**Message Flows (Interactions between Pools):**
*   **Sales to Production & Procurement:** "Order details" are sent to both pools to initiate their respective processes.
*   **Production to Warehouse:** "Product complete" is sent to trigger the shipping process.
*   **Warehouse to Sales:** "Product sent" is sent to inform Sales that the product has been shipped, allowing them to proceed with invoicing.
*   **Procurement to Production:** "Order cancellation" is sent to interrupt and terminate the production process if necessary.

In summary, this BPMN diagram illustrates a collaborative order fulfillment process, starting with sales validation, moving through parallel production and material procurement, and concluding with product shipment and invoice generation, with built-in mechanisms for handling new customers, faulty materials, and order cancellations.
