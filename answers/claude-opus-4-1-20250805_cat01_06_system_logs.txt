## Explanation of Transformation Logic

### Case Identification Strategy:
I identified cases based on **document/task context** rather than purely temporal proximity. Each case represents a coherent unit of work focused on a specific document or task:

1. **DOC_001**: All activities related to "Document1.docx" - including the initial editing session, the brief interruption for other tasks, and the return to complete the document with budget references.

2. **EMAIL_001**: A complete email handling workflow for the Annual Meeting email, from opening through reading, replying, and sending.

3. **PDF_001**: PDF review activities for "Report_Draft.pdf" including navigation and annotation.

4. **BUDGET_001**: Budget spreadsheet work session for "Budget_2024.xlsx".

5. **REPORT_001**: Quarterly report editing session, treated as separate from DOC_001 as it's a different document with distinct purpose.

### Activity Naming Conventions:
I standardized the raw system actions into business-meaningful activities:

- **FOCUS**  "Open Document/Email/PDF/Spreadsheet" (context-dependent)
- **TYPING**  "Edit Document", "Compose Reply", "Update Data" (based on application context)
- **SAVE**  "Save Document/Spreadsheet"
- **CLICK**  Translated to meaningful actions like "Open Email", "Start Reply", "Send Email"
- **SCROLL**  "Read Email" or "Review PDF" (contextual interpretation)
- **HIGHLIGHT**  "Annotate PDF"
- **SWITCH** returning to a document  "Resume Editing"
- **CLOSE**  "Close Document"

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Document-centric cases**: Each document/task forms its own case, allowing process mining tools to analyze work patterns per document type.

2. **Meaningful activity names**: Rather than keeping technical terms like "TYPING" or "CLICK", I translated these into business activities that describe what the user was actually doing.

3. **Preserved temporal order**: While grouping by case, the timestamp order is maintained to show the true workflow including task switching.

4. **Additional attributes**: Included application, document name, and details to provide rich context for process analysis.

This transformation creates a process log suitable for analyzing user work patterns, identifying common document workflows, and understanding task-switching behaviors in knowledge work.
