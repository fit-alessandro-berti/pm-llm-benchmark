 Based on the provided data, we can reconstruct the processes involved in managing customer orders, transport documents, and stock handling within a logistics or supply chain environment. Let's break down the processes step-by-step:

### Process for Object Type: Stock Item (3 items)
1. **Place in Stock**: Items are placed into stock, with 445 events.
2. **Bring to Loading Bay**: Items are moved from stock to the loading bay, with 445 events.
3. **Weigh**: The items are weighed before being loaded onto a vehicle. This event occurs in two different paths:
   - From "Place in Stock" directly to "Weigh" (frequency = 210).
   - From "Bring to Loading Bay" to "Weigh" (frequency = 449).
4. **Load to Vehicle**: The weighed items are loaded onto a vehicle, with a frequency of:
   - Directly from "Place in Stock" to "Load to Vehicle" (frequency = 20).
   - From "Weigh" to "Load to Vehicle" (frequency = 185).
5. **Self-looping Events**: Some self-referential loops occur, likely indicating errors or reprocessing:
   - "Place in Stock" -> "Place in Stock" (frequency = 23).
   - "Load to Vehicle" -> "Place in Stock" (frequency = 118).
   - "Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" (frequency = 8).
6. **Repeated Cycles**: Items are sometimes reprocessed through different steps:
   - "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (frequency = 4).
   - "Weigh" -> "Weigh" (frequency = 1).

### Process for Object Type: Customer Order
1. **Register Customer Order**: A customer order is registered, with 594 unique orders.
2. **Create Transport Document**: For each customer order, a transport document is created. This is a straightforward one-to-one mapping.

### Process for Object Type: Transport Document (594 documents)
1. **Create Transport Document**: Each transport document is associated with a registered customer order.
2. **Book Vehicles**: For each transport document, vehicles are booked. This step has a duration of 22.21 seconds on average for each document.
3. **Order Empty Containers**: After booking the vehicle, empty containers are ordered to carry the goods. This step has an average duration of 43.94 seconds per transport document.
4. **Depart**: Once all necessary steps are completed (ordering empty containers), the transport documents/vehicles depart. Most documents (561 out of 594) move directly to this stage, while others undergo rescheduling.
   - **Self-loop for "Depart"**: Some transport documents experience a loop back to the "Depart" step, possibly due to delays or reschedules (frequency = 142).
5. **Reschedule Container**: In cases where there are issues with the initial scheduling or containers, a rescheduling process takes place:
   - From "Order Empty Containers" -> "Reschedule Container" (frequency = 13).
   - From "Depart" -> "Reschedule Container" (frequency = 21).
6. **Self-loops for "Reschedule Container"**: Some transport documents experience multiple rescheduling attempts:
   - "Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container" (frequency = 2).

### Summary of Processes
- **Stock Handling**: Items are placed in stock, brought to the loading bay, weighed, and loaded onto vehicles. There are multiple iterations and loops indicating potential rework or errors.
- **Customer Orders**: Each customer order is registered and directly linked to a transport document creation.
- **Transport Documents**: Transport documents go through vehicle booking, container ordering, departure, and possible rescheduling. Some documents encounter delays or require multiple attempts to finalize their processing.

### Key Observations:
1. **High Frequency of Self-loops**: There are numerous self-loop events in both stock handling (e.g., "Place in Stock" -> "Place in Stock") and transport document management (e.g., "Depart" -> "Depart"). This indicates potential bottlenecks or errors that need to be addressed.
2. **Duration Variability**: Duration varies significantly between different steps, with some taking only seconds while others take much longer, possibly indicating complexity in those processes.
3. **Error Handling**: The presence of multiple iterations and rescheduling steps indicates a robust error-handling mechanism within the process.

Overall, these processes highlight a complex logistics system that handles various steps of stock management and transport documentation, with built-in mechanisms to handle errors and delays effectively.
