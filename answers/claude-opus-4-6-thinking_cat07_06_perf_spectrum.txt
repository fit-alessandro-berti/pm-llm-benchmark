# Process Flow Visualization: Fine Management Over Time

## Overview
This is a **temporal process flow visualization** (likely from process mining) that depicts the progression of cases through three sequential stages of a fine/penalty management process over approximately **13 years** (January 2000 to April 2013).

## Three Process Stages (Top to Bottom)
1. **Send Fine** — the initial event (top)
2. **Insert Fine Notification** — an intermediate step (middle)
3. **Send for Credit Collection** — the final escalation step (bottom)

## Visual Elements

### Upper Section (Gray/Black Lines)
- Vertical lines at the top represent individual **"Send Fine"** events distributed across time.
- These lines connect downward to the **"Insert Fine Notification"** stage, with lines fanning to the right, indicating **varying delays** between sending a fine and inserting the notification.

### Lower Section (Pink/Red Lines)
- Lines from **"Insert Fine Notification"** fan out dramatically toward **"Send for Credit Collection."**
- The distinctive **fan-shaped clusters** suggest that credit collection events are processed in **batches**, where many accumulated cases converge to a single collection point.
- The longer, more spread-out fans indicate **significant and variable time delays** — sometimes spanning years — before unpaid fines are escalated to credit collection.

## Key Insights
- **Volume**: There are thousands of cases represented, indicated by the dense overlapping lines.
- **Batch processing**: The convergent fan patterns suggest periodic batch processing for credit collection.
- **Increasing delays over time**: Later cases appear to show wider fans, possibly reflecting longer processing times or backlogs.
- **Not all cases escalate**: The lower section appears less dense than the upper, suggesting only a subset of fines ultimately reach credit collection.

This is likely derived from the well-known **BPI Challenge road traffic fines dataset**, commonly used in process mining research.
