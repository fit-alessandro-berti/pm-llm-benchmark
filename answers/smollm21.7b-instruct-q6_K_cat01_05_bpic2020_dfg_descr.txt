The given flow describes a management process for approving and handling payments related to requests submitted by employees. Here's an overview of how it operates:

1. The employee submits a request payment, which is initially approved or rejected depending on approval status assigned by SUPERVISOR.
2. If approved, the request payment becomes "Request Payment," indicating that the payment has been asked for but not yet granted.
3. Upon submission of Request Payment, it then goes to the PRE_APPROVER for review before being passed to SUPERVISOR for final approval.
4. If approved at this level, the process moves on to other stakeholders and stages:
   - After SUPERVISOR's approval, it proceeds to "Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" status.
   - Once declared "APPROVED," it can either go to "Payment Handled" for actual processing or be rejected again at this stage if the original request was not approved.
5. If the request payment is not granted, the process terminates:
   - If the employee submits the same request again, it follows the same stages as before but will now have a different status and outcome than the initial submission due to rejection.
   - The "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" becomes "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" if rejected at any stage, indicating that the employee's request for payment was unsuccessful.
6. If approved, the payment is processed through various stages until it reaches the final status of being "Payment Handled." This involves other stakeholders and approval processes before the actual processing of the payment occurs.
