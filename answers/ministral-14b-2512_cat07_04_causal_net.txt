The diagram illustrates a process flow for handling a request, starting from node 'a' labeled 'register request' and ending at node 'z' labeled 'end'. The process involves several intermediate steps: thorough examination (b), casual examination (c), checking a ticket (d), reinitiating the request (f), deciding on the request (e), paying compensation (g), and rejecting the request (h). The flow splits and joins at various points, indicating different paths the process can take. The lower part of the diagram provides a legend for different types of splits and joins: XOR-split, AND-split, OR-split, XOR-join, AND-join, and OR-join. These splits and joins represent different logical conditions under which the process can branch or converge. For instance, an XOR-split indicates that only one of the subsequent paths can be taken, while an AND-split indicates that all subsequent paths must be taken. The diagram effectively communicates the decision-making and branching logic involved in processing a request, highlighting the structured flow and conditional paths within the process.
