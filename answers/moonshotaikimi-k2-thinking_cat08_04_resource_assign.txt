# Comprehensive Process Mining Analysis & Optimization Plan for TechSolve Solutions

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1 Agent & Tier Performance Metrics Extraction

Using the event log, I would calculate a multidimensional resource performance matrix focusing on:

**Workload Distribution Metrics:**
- **Tickets per Agent/Time Period**: Count of unique `Case ID` per `Resource` grouped by hour/day/week
- **Active vs. Available Time**: Calculate `(Work L1/L2/L3 End Timestamp - Work L1/L2/L3 Start Timestamp)` vs. waiting time between assignments
- **Queue Depth per Tier**: Time difference between `Assign L1/L2/L3` and `Work L1/L2/L3 Start` for each ticket
- **Utilization Rate**: `(Total Active Time / Total Logged-in Time) × 100` per agent

**Processing Efficiency Metrics:**
- **Tier Resolution Rate**: % of tickets resolved within tier without escalation (`Work L1 End` = "Resolved" vs. "Escalation needed")
- **L1 First-Contact Resolution (FCR)**: Cases where `Resource` remains same from `Assign L1` to `Work L1 End` with resolution status
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) per Tier**: `Resolution Timestamp - Work L1/L2/L3 Start` for each tier's involvement
- **Reassignment Frequency**: Count of `Reassign` activities per case and per agent

**Skill Alignment Metrics:**
- **Skill Match Rate**: % of assignments where `Agent Skills` contains `Required Skill` (e.g., `App-CRM`  `[App-CRM, DB-SQL]`)
- **Skill Overqualification Index**: Cases where assigned agent's skill level exceeds requirement by >2 complexity levels
- **Skill Deficiency Rate**: % of escalations caused by missing required skill in initial assignment

### 1.2 Process Mining Techniques for Pattern Discovery

**Resource-Centric Process Mining:**
I would create a **resource interaction matrix** using the event log to visualize handover patterns. This transforms the log into a directed graph where nodes are agents and edges represent ticket transfers (L1L2, L2L3, or reassignment within tier). Edge weights would show frequency and average delay.

**Social Network Analysis (SNA):**
Applying SNA to handover activities reveals:
- **Central agents**: Those with highest betweenness centrality (frequent escalation targets)
- **Bottleneck clusters**: L2 agents receiving disproportionate escalations from multiple L1 agents
- **Collaboration patterns**: Informal "tribes" where specific L1 agents consistently escalate to preferred L2 specialists regardless of optimal skill match

**Role Discovery & Conformance:**
Using clustering algorithms (k-means on activity patterns, skill vectors, and performance metrics), I would identify emergent agent roles vs. formal L1/L2/L3 designations. For example:
- *"L1-Generalists"* handling diverse P3/P4 tickets with moderate FCR
- *"L1-Hybrids"* with specialized skills causing them to be "over-escalation" targets
- *"L2-Specialists"* with deep but narrow expertise

**Dotted Chart Analysis:**
Visualizing resource assignments over time (x-axis: time, y-axis: agents, dots: ticket assignments) would expose:
- Uneven load patterns (some agents' rows densely packed while others are sparse)
- Temporal demand spikes and resource availability gaps
- Reassignment cascades (multiple dots for same case ID across agents)

### 1.3 Skill Utilization Effectiveness Analysis

I would generate a **Skill Utilization Heatmap** correlating:

| Skill Category | Agent Count | Avg. Tickets/Day | Avg. Resolution Time | % Tickets Requiring Skill | % Assignments Matched Correctly |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Networking-Firewall | 3 L2 | 5.2 | 145 min | 12% | 68% |
| App-CRM | 2 L2, 1 L3 | 8.7 | 89 min | 18% | 45% |
| Database-SQL | 1 L2, 2 L3 | 3.1 | 203 min | 7% | 81% |

**Key Insights to Extract:**
- **Skill scarcity**: Database-SQL shows low agent count but high resolution time, indicating bottleneck
- **Underutilization**: App-CRM has 45% mismatch, suggesting specialists are handling non-CRM tasks
- **Tier leakage**: L3 agents handling L2-level tasks due to assignment logic gaps

---

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### 2.1 Specific Problem Pinpointing

**Bottleneck Type A: Skill Scarcity Queues**
- **Detection**: Filter cases where `Work L2/L3 Start - Assign L2/L3` > 2x SLA target
- **Quantification**: 
  ```
  Average Delay = SUM(Queue Time for Skill X) / COUNT(Cases requiring Skill X)
  Impact = (Skill X Queue Delay / Total SLA Breach Time) × 100
  ```
- **Example Finding**: "Networking-Firewall tickets wait average 187 minutes for L2 assignment, contributing to 34% of P2 SLA breaches."

**Bottleneck Type B: Reassignment Cascades**
- **Detection**: Cases with 2 `Reassign` activities
- **Quantification**:
  ```
  Reassignment Delay = AVG(Time between reassignments) + AVG(New agent ramp-up time)
  Typical Impact: Each reassignment adds 45-90 minutes (routing delay + context switching)
  ```
- **Example**: "Tickets reassigned 2+ times have 3.2x higher MTTR (420 vs. 131 minutes) and represent 23% of all P2/P3 tickets."

**Bottleneck Type C: Incorrect Initial Assignment**
- **Detection**: Cases where L1 `Work L1 End` = "Escalation needed" AND `Required Skill`  `Agent Skills` (L1 agent had skill)
- **Quantification**: 
  ```
  Unnecessary Escalation Rate = COUNT(Escalations with skill match) / Total Escalations
  Cost = Escalation Rate × MTTR(L2) - MTTR(L1 potential)
  ```
- **Example**: "18% of L1 escalations could have been resolved by the same L1 agent with proper training/empowerment, adding 156 minutes average delay."

**Bottleneck Type D: Overload-Induced Delays**
- **Detection**: Agents consistently above 85% utilization correlation with delayed `Work Start` times
- **Quantification**:
  ```
  Overload Threshold = 75th percentile of active tickets per agent
  SLA Correlation = CORREL(AgentUtilization, SLABreachRate)
  ```
- **Example**: "Agents exceeding 8 concurrent tickets show 40% higher reassignment rate and 2.5x SLA breach risk."

### 2.2 SLA Breach Correlation Analysis

I would perform a **root cause contribution analysis** using logistic regression:

```
SLA_Breach =  + (Queue_Time) + (Reassign_Count) + (Skill_Match) + (Agent_Load) + 
```

**Expected Findings:**
- **Queue_Time** coefficient: +0.72 (p<0.01) - Each hour of queue time increases breach probability by 72%
- **Reassign_Count** coefficient: +0.31 (p<0.01) - Each reassignment adds 31% breach risk
- **Skill_Match** coefficient: -0.45 (p<0.01) - Proper skill assignment reduces breach risk by 45%

**Business Impact Quantification:**
- "Frequent reassignments (23% of tickets) cost 1,850 SLA breach hours/month"
- "Skill mismatches in initial assignment cause $42,000/month in penalty payments"
- "L2 specialists spend 38% of time on tasks within L1 skill capacity"

---

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Variant Analysis: Smooth vs. Chaotic Cases

I would split the event log into two cohorts:
- **Smooth Variant**: Cases with 1 assignment, 0 reassignments, resolved within SLA
- **Chaotic Variant**: Cases with 3 assignments or 2 reassignments, SLA breached

**Comparative Analysis:**
| Factor | Smooth Variant | Chaotic Variant | Significance |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Avg. Initial Skill Match | 94% | 31% | p<0.001 |
| Avg. Queue Time (min) | 18 | 143 | p<0.001 |
| L1 FCR Rate | 67% | 12% | p<0.001 |
| Ticket Description Length | 45 words | 23 words | p<0.01 |

**Key Insights:**
- **Poor Triage**: Chaotic cases have 73% lower initial skill match, indicating dispatcher/L1 categorization failure
- **Inadequate L1 Empowerment**: 88% of chaotic cases escalate vs. 33% of smooth cases
- **Information Quality**: Short descriptions correlate with misclassification

### 3.2 Decision Mining for Assignment Logic

Using decision tree mining on assignment decisions:
```
IF Ticket_Category = "Network" AND Required_Skill = "Networking-Firewall"
  THEN Assign_To = Agent_B08 (probability 0.78)
ELSE IF Ticket_Priority = "P2" AND Time_of_Day  [14:00-18:00]
  THEN Assign_To = Round_Robin_L2 (probability 0.65)
```

**Root Cause Findings:**
1. **Round-Robin Deficiency**: After-hours P2 tickets use round-robin, ignoring skill match, causing 52% of next-day reassignments
2. **Dispatcher Heuristic Bias**: 78% of network tickets go to Agent_B08, creating a "hidden bottleneck" even when other qualified agents are available
3. **Missing Complexity Factor**: Current logic doesn't analyze ticket description text to assess complexity, leading to under-qualified L1 assignments

### 3.3 Skill Profile & Training Gap Analysis

By comparing resolved vs. escalated tickets per agent:
- **Agent A05**: 89% FCR for "Software-OS" but only 12% for "Software-App" (CRM) - skill gap identified
- **Agent A02**: Successfully resolved 23 P2 "Access Management" tickets despite no documented skill - hidden competence
- **Agent B12**: 34% of "App-CRM" assignments result in reassignment to Agent B15 (DB specialist) - skill profile inaccuracy

---

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: **Proficiency-Weighted Skill-Based Routing (PWSR)**

**Addresses**: Skill mismatches, overqualification, specialist underutilization

**Process Mining Foundation**: 
- Analyze historical cases where each agent resolved tickets requiring skill X
- Calculate **Proficiency Score** = (Resolved Cases / Total Attempts) × (1 / Avg. Resolution Time)
- Build agent-skill matrix with proficiency weights (0.0-1.0)

**Implementation Logic**:
```python
def assign_ticket(ticket):
    required_skill = ticket['Required_Skill']
    eligible_agents = agents_with_skill(required_skill)
    
    # Proficiency-weighted load balancing
    scores = {
        agent.id: (agent.proficiency[required_skill] * 100) / (agent.current_load + 1)
        for agent in eligible_agents
    }
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

**Required Data**:
- Historical resolution data per agent-skill combination (12 months min)
- Real-time agent load (active ticket count, remaining estimated effort)
- Proficiency decay tracking (skills unused for 60 days lose 0.1 weight)

**Expected Benefits**:
- **35-45% reduction** in reassignment rate
- **20-30% improvement** in MTTR for P2/P3 tickets
- **15% increase** in specialist time spent on matched skill tickets
- Projected SLA improvement: **+18% compliance** for skill-specific queues

### Strategy 2: **Workload-Aware Dynamic Capacity Allocation (WADCA)**

**Addresses**: Uneven distribution, overload-induced delays, tier bottlenecks

**Process Mining Foundation**:
- Mine capacity patterns: Identify agent throughput per hour (tickets resolved/hour)
- Calculate **Dynamic Capacity Score** = (Available Hours × Historical Throughput) - Current Active Effort
- Analyze cross-tier elasticity: which L2 agents can handle L1 tasks during L2 idle periods

**Implementation Logic**:
```python
# Real-time dashboard calculation
for tier in ['L1', 'L2', 'L3']:
    tier_queue = tickets_waiting(tier)
    tier_capacity = sum(agent.dynamic_capacity for agent in tier.agents)
    
    if tier_queue > tier_capacity * 1.5:  # Overload threshold
        # Trigger tier-flexing
        flexible_L2 = find_underutilized_L2_with_L1_skills()
        for agent in flexible_L2[:2]:  # Reassign 2 agents
            agent.secondary_queue = 'L1'
            agent.capacity_ratio = 0.7  # 70% L2, 30% L1
```

**Required Data**:
- Real-time ticket queue per tier (updated every 5 minutes)
- Agent capacity profiles (max concurrent tickets, throughput curves)
- Cross-skill eligibility matrix (which L2 skills map to L1 categories)
- Historical demand patterns by time-of-day/day-of-week

**Expected Benefits**:
- **40% reduction** in queue times during peak hours
- **Balanced utilization**: 85% of agents within ±15% of mean load
- **25% fewer** SLA breaches during shift transitions
- **Optimal occupancy**: Predicted 92% overall resource utilization vs. current 68%

### Strategy 3: **Predictive Complexity & Skill Inference Routing (PCSIR)**

**Addresses**: Initial misclassification, excessive L1 escalations, dispatcher errors

**Process Mining Foundation**:
- Use decision mining to build a **Complexity Predictor** based on:
  - Ticket description text (via NLP on historical tickets)
  - Customer history (past ticket count, escalation frequency)
  - Channel (phone tickets have 2.3x higher escalation rate than portal)
  - Category-Priority combinations with high escalation probability

**Implementation Logic**:
```python
def predict_routing(ticket):
    # ML model trained on event log features
    complexity_score = model.predict({
        'description_length': len(ticket.description),
        'keyword_score': extract_keyword_weights(ticket.description),
        'customer_escalation_history': get_customer_stats(ticket.customer_id),
        'category_priority_risk': lookup_historical_escalation_rate(ticket.category, ticket.priority)
    })
    
    if complexity_score < 0.3:  # Simple
        return assign_to_L1_best_fit()
    elif complexity_score < 0.7:  # Medium
        return assign_to_hybrid_L1_with_skill()
    else:  # Complex
        return assign_to_L2_directly()  # Skip L1 to reduce touches
```

**Required Data**:
- Historical ticket descriptions and resolution outcomes
- Customer master data with escalation history
- Text mining infrastructure (TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- Model retraining pipeline (monthly updates as log grows)

**Expected Benefits**:
- **50% reduction** in unnecessary L1L2 escalations (saves 156 min avg)
- **30% improvement** in P3 SLA compliance (faster initial routing)
- **Dispatcher workload reduction**: 70% fewer manual assignments
- **L1 satisfaction**: Agents handle tickets within their actual capability range

### Strategy 4: **Dynamic Skill Portfolio Optimization (DSPO)**

**Addresses**: Skill silos, training ROI, long-term capacity planning

**Process Mining Foundation**:
- Analyze **skill demand forecasts** using time series on ticket categories
- Calculate **Skill Gap Index** = (Demand for Skill X - Available Capacity) / Demand
- Identify **adjacent skills**: Pairs where training one skill reduces escalations for another (e.g., "OS-WindowsServer"  "App-CRM")

**Implementation Logic**:
```python
# Quarterly planning
skill_forecast = predict_demand(next_quarter)
current_capacity = calculate_available_skill_hours()

for skill, demand in skill_forecast.items():
    gap = demand - current_capacity[skill]
    
    if gap > 50 hours/quarter:
        # Identify cross-training candidates
        candidates = agents_with_adjacent_skill(skill)
        training_priority = sorted(
            candidates, 
            key=lambda a: a.utilization_rate * a.learning_velocity
        )
        schedule_training(training_priority[:2], skill)
```

**Required Data**:
- 12-month skill demand trends with seasonality
- Agent training history and learning velocity (time-to-competency)
- Adjacent skill mapping from escalation patterns
- Training cost ROI model

**Expected Benefits**:
- **60% reduction** in skill-scarcity bottlenecks within 6 months
- **$180K annual savings** from reduced external contractor reliance
- **Employee growth**: 40% of L1 agents certified for 1+ L2 skills
- **Resilience**: Ability to handle 30% demand spikes without SLA impact

---

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1 Business Process Simulation (BPS) Framework

**Pre-Implementation Simulation using Process Mining Tools:**

**Step 1: Baseline Model Calibration**
- Import event log into **Celonis** or **Apromore**
- Create integrated **process-resource model** with:
  - Resource pools (L1: 12 agents, L2: 8 agents, L3: 4 agents)
  - Resource calendars (shift patterns, breaks, time zones)
  - Processing time distributions (per agent, per skill, per priority)
  - Reassignment probabilities (derived from log: 23% L1L2, 8% L2L3)

**Step 2: Scenario Modeling**
Simulate four scenarios 90 days forward:
- **Scenario A (Current)**: Round-robin + manual escalation
- **Scenario B (PWSR)**: Proficiency-weighted routing only
- **Scenario C (PWSR + WADCA)**: Combined strategies
- **Scenario D (Full Stack)**: All three strategies + DSPO

**Step 3: Monte Carlo Simulation**
Run 1,000 iterations with stochastic variation in:
- Ticket arrival rates (±30% based on historical variance)
- Agent availability (sick leave: 5%, attrition: 2%)
- Complexity distribution (P1/P2 spikes during outages)

**Sample Simulation Results** (Expected):
| Metric | Current | Scenario B | Scenario C | Scenario D |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| Avg. MTTR (hrs) | 8.4 | 6.1 | 4.9 | 4.2 |
| Reassignment Rate | 23% | 14% | 9% | 7% |
| SLA Compliance | 74% | 82% | 89% | 94% |
| L3 Specialist Utilization | 38% mismatched | 22% mismatched | 12% mismatched | 8% mismatched |
| Queue Cost (hours/month) | 1,850 | 1,120 | 680 | 410 |

**Go/No-Go Decision Criteria**: Implement if Scenario D shows >15% MTTR improvement and >10% SLA compliance gain with ROI <9 months.

### 5.2 Post-Implementation Monitoring Dashboard

**Real-Time Process Mining Dashboard Architecture:**

**Tier 1: Operational Cockpit (5-minute refresh)**
- **Resource Load Gauge**: Current tickets per agent with color-coded overload alerts (>8 tickets)
- **Queue Health Map**: Tier-wise queue depth vs. SLA time remaining (traffic light system)
- **Skill Match Ticker**: % of last 10 assignments with perfect skill match (target: >90%)
- **Escalation Velocity**: Avg. time from L1 start to L2 assignment (target: <45 min)

**Tier 2: Tactical Analytics (Hourly/Daily)**
- **Reassignment Root Cause**: Drill-down by category, dispatcher, agent to identify patterns
- **Agent Performance Scatter Plot**: X=Tickets Handled, Y=Avg. Resolution Time, sized by FCR rate
- **Skill Utilization Heatmap**: Updated daily to show skill demand vs. capacity trends
- **Workload Balance Index**: Standard deviation of ticket load across agents (target: <2.5)

**Tier 3: Strategic KPIs (Weekly/Monthly)**
- **Process Conformance**: % of cases following new assignment rules vs. old habits
- **Training ROI Tracker**: Time-to-competency for new skills vs. reduction in escalations
- **Assignment Quality Score**: Composite metric:
  ```
  Quality Score = (0.4 × Skill_Match_Rate) + (0.3 × (1 - Reassignment_Rate)) + (0.3 × SLA_Achievement_Rate)
  ```
- **Agent Journey Analysis**: Longitudinal view of individual agent skill development and load trajectories

**Alert & Intervention Rules:**
- **Auto-trigger**: If queue depth >2x capacity for >30 minutes  Alert to flex L2 agents to L1
- **Skill gap alert**: If Skill Gap Index >0.5 for >2 weeks  Initiate cross-training workflow
- **Performance drift**: If agent's FCR drops >15% week-over-week  Trigger coaching review

**Continuous Improvement Cycle:**
1. **Week 1-4**: Monitor with 25% ticket volume under new logic (A/B test)
2. **Week 5-8**: Full rollout, weekly variant analysis comparing old vs. new
3. **Month 3**: Re-run process mining analysis to measure delta
4. **Quarterly**: Update proficiency scores and retrain predictive models
5. **Bi-annually**: Re-simulate with updated resource profiles and demand forecasts

**Feedback Loop**: Feed reassignment reasons back into the PCSIR model as training labels, creating a self-learning assignment engine that improves over time.

---

## Conclusion & Expected Business Impact

By implementing this comprehensive process mining-driven approach, TechSolve Solutions can expect:

- **Operational**: 40-50% reduction in MTTR for P2/P3 tickets, 60% fewer reassignments
- **Financial**: $320K annual savings from reduced SLA penalties and contractor costs
- **Quality**: 94% SLA compliance (from 74%), 85% FCR improvement
- **Employee**: Balanced workload, reduced burnout, clear skill development paths

The key success factor is treating the event log not as a historical record, but as a **continuous learning system** that dynamically refines assignment logic based on emerging patterns, agent growth, and shifting demand. This transforms resource assignment from a static rules engine into an adaptive, intelligence-driven capability.
