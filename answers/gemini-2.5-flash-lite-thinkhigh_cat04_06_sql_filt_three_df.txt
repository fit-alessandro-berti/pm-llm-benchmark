**Explanation:**

1.  **`SequentialEvents` CTE:**
    *   We start by selecting rows from `event_log` where the `activity` is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. This is an optimization because only these rows can be the *start* of our target sequence.
    *   We then use the `LEAD()` window function.
        *   `PARTITION BY el.case_id ORDER BY el.timestamp` ensures that the `LEAD()` function looks at subsequent events *within the same case*, ordered chronologically.
        *   `LEAD(el.activity, 1)` gets the activity of the very next event in that case.
        *   `LEAD(el.activity, 2)` gets the activity of the event two steps ahead.
        *   We do the same for timestamps (`timestamp_B`, `timestamp_C`).
    *   This CTE effectively creates rows where, for each 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event, we also have the details of the *immediately next* and the *immediately following next* events in that case.

2.  **`CasesToExclude` CTE:**
    *   This CTE takes the results from `SequentialEvents`.
    *   It filters these results to identify rows where:
        *   `activity_B` is 'Create Order'.
        *   `activity_C` is 'Confirm Order'.
        *   The difference between `timestamp_C` and `timestamp_B` is greater than 5 days. DuckDB's `INTERVAL '5 day'` syntax is used for this temporal comparison.
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` ensures that we get a unique list of `case_id`s that meet *all* these criteria. If a case happens to have multiple such sequences that meet the timing condition, its `case_id` will still only appear once in this exclusion list.

3.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   This statement selects all columns (`el.*`) from the original `event_log` table.
    *   The `WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesToExclude)` clause filters out any event that belongs to a `case_id` found in the `CasesToExclude` CTE. This effectively returns all events *except* those from the problematic cases.
