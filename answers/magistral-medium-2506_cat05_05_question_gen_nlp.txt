5. How does the company ensure compliance with varying environmental and labor regulations across different countries in its supply chain?
6. What are the most common bottlenecks in the supply chain, and how does the company prioritize which ones to address first?
7. How does the company manage transportation delays (e.g., port congestion, customs clearance) and their impact on delivery timelines?
