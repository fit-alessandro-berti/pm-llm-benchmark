Some of the main anomalies in the process variants are:

1. The high frequency and performance values for the process variant "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Send for Credit Collection" compared to other variants indicate that this specific path is significantly more common and efficient than others.

2. The process variant "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Appeal to Judge -> Payment" has a high performance value compared to other variants, indicating that this specific path may be more complex or time-consuming.

3. There are instances where the frequency of certain process variants is very low, such as "Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture" with a frequency of only 9, indicating that this path is rarely taken in the overall process.

4. Some process variants have a high number of steps, such as "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Add penalty -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender -> Appeal to Judge -> Payment", which may suggest a more complex or convoluted process flow compared to other variants.
