Excellent. This is a classic process mining task that is well-suited for a modern analytical database like DuckDB. The query requires several logical steps, which are best expressed using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for clarity and modularity.

### Solution

Here is the complete DuckDB SQL query that solves the problem. This solution is designed to be readable, efficient, and directly addresses all parts of the prompt. We will use a `K` value of `2` for this concrete example.

```sql
-- Let K = 2 for this example. We want the top 2 most frequent process variants.

WITH
  -- Step 1: For each case, create an ordered list of activities (the variant).
  -- The `list()` aggregate function with an `ORDER BY` clause is perfect for this.
  case_to_variant AS (
    SELECT
      case_id,
      list(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM
      event_log
    GROUP BY
      case_id
  ),

  -- Step 2 & 3: Count the occurrences of each unique variant to find their frequency,
  -- and then select the top K (in this case, top 2) most frequent variants.
  top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
      variant
    FROM
      case_to_variant
    GROUP BY
      variant
    ORDER BY
      COUNT(case_id) DESC
    LIMIT 2 -- This is our K
  )

-- Step 4: Filter the original event log.
-- We select all events where the `case_id` belongs to a case whose variant
-- is present in our `top_k_variants` CTE.
SELECT
  log.*
FROM
  event_log AS log
  -- We join back to our `case_to_variant` mapping to find the variant for each event's case.
  JOIN case_to_variant AS cv
  ON log.case_id = cv.case_id
  -- We use an INNER JOIN with `top_k_variants` which acts as a filter,
  -- keeping only the rows where the variant is one of the top K.
  JOIN top_k_variants AS top
  ON cv.variant = top.variant
ORDER BY
  log.case_id,
  log.timestamp;

```

### Breakdown of the Logic

1.  **`case_to_variant` CTE:**
    *   This is the core of variant identification. It groups the `event_log` by `case_id`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each case), it uses `list(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` to aggregate all activity names into an ordered list (an array). The `ORDER BY timestamp` inside the aggregate function is a crucial DuckDB feature that ensures the sequence is correct.
    *   The result is a mapping: `case_id` -> `['activity_1', 'activity_2', ...]`.

2.  **`top_k_variants` CTE:**
    *   This CTE takes the `case_to_variant` mapping as its input.
    *   It groups by the `variant` list itself to find unique variants.
    *   `COUNT(case_id)` calculates the frequency of each unique variant.
    *   `ORDER BY ... DESC LIMIT 2` sorts these unique variants by their frequency in descending order and keeps only the top 2.

3.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   This query retrieves the final desired output: the original event records.
    *   It starts with the full `event_log` table.
    *   It `JOIN`s with `case_to_variant` to associate each event row with its case's complete variant sequence.
    *   It then performs a final `INNER JOIN` with `top_k_variants`. This is the filtering step. An `INNER JOIN` will only keep rows where the key exists in both tables. Therefore, only events whose `variant` is in the `top_k_variants` list will be kept.
    *   The final `ORDER BY` clause is added for readable output but is not strictly required by the prompt.

### Demonstrative Example

Let's create a sample table and run the query to see it in action.

```sql
-- Setup: Create a table and insert sample data
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE event_log (
  case_id INTEGER,
  activity VARCHAR,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO event_log VALUES
  (1, 'Register', '2023-01-01 09:00:00'),
  (1, 'Analyze', '2023-01-01 09:05:00'),
  (1, 'Decide', '2023-01-01 09:10:00'),
  (1, 'Close', '2023-01-01 09:15:00'),

  (2, 'Register', '2023-01-02 10:00:00'),
  (2, 'Analyze', '2023-01-02 10:05:00'),
  (2, 'Decide', '2023-01-02 10:10:00'),
  (2, 'Close', '2023-01-02 10:15:00'),

  (3, 'Register', '2023-01-03 11:00:00'),
  (3, 'Analyze', '2023-01-03 11:05:00'),
  (3, 'Request Info', '2023-01-03 11:10:00'),
  (3, 'Close', '2023-01-03 11:15:00'),

  (4, 'Register', '2023-01-04 12:00:00'),
  (4, 'Analyze', '2023-01-04 12:05:00'),
  (4, 'Decide', '2023-01-04 12:10:00'),
  (4, 'Close', '2023-01-04 12:15:00'),

  (5, 'Register', '2023-01-05 13:00:00'),
  (5, 'Close', '2023-01-05 13:05:00');

-- The variants in this data are:
-- Variant A: ['Register', 'Analyze', 'Decide', 'Close'] -> Occurs in cases 1, 2, 4 (Frequency: 3)
-- Variant B: ['Register', 'Analyze', 'Request Info', 'Close'] -> Occurs in case 3 (Frequency: 1)
-- Variant C: ['Register', 'Close'] -> Occurs in case 5 (Frequency: 1)

-- The top 2 variants are A and B (or C, depending on tie-breaking).
-- The query should return all events from cases 1, 2, 4, and 3. Case 5 should be excluded.

-- Running the benchmark query with K=2
WITH
  case_to_variant AS (
    SELECT
      case_id,
      list(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM
      event_log
    GROUP BY
      case_id
  ),
  top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
      variant
    FROM
      case_to_variant
    GROUP BY
      variant
    ORDER BY
      COUNT(case_id) DESC
    LIMIT 2
  )
SELECT
  log.*
FROM
  event_log AS log
  JOIN case_to_variant AS cv
  ON log.case_id = cv.case_id
  JOIN top_k_variants AS top
  ON cv.variant = top.variant
ORDER BY
  log.case_id,
  log.timestamp;

```

#### Expected Output for K=2:

The query will correctly identify Variant A (frequency 3) as the top variant and Variant B (frequency 1) as the second most frequent (or Variant C, the result is the same). It will then return all 16 rows corresponding to cases `1, 2, 3, 4` and exclude the 2 rows from case `5`.
