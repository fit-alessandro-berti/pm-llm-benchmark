Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects can have several benefits and challenges. Here are some of the main advantages and disadvantages:

**Benefits:**

1. **Scalability**: Decomposition allows process mining to be applied to large and complex datasets, making it possible to analyze processes with thousands of events and activities.
2. **Computational efficiency**: Decomposition strategies can reduce the computational complexity of process mining algorithms, enabling faster analysis and more efficient use of computational resources.
3. **Improved interpretability**: By breaking down a complex process into smaller sub-processes, decomposition can make the process easier to understand and interpret, facilitating better insights and decision-making.
4. **Enhanced model quality**: Decomposition can help improve the quality of process models by reducing the impact of noise and variability in the data.
5. **Flexibility and modularity**: Decomposition strategies allow for a modular approach to process mining, enabling the analysis of specific parts of the process or the reuse of already mined sub-processes.

**Challenges:**

1. **Selection of decomposition strategy**: Choosing the right decomposition strategy can be challenging, as it depends on the specific characteristics of the process and the data.
2. **Loss of global context**: decomposing a process into sub-processes can lead to a loss of global context, making it difficult to understand the relationships between different sub-processes.
3. **Complexity of sub-processes**: While decomposition can simplify the analysis of individual sub-processes, the sub-processes themselves can still be complex and difficult to analyze.
4. **Consistency and compatibility**: Ensuring consistency and compatibility across sub-processes can be challenging, particularly if different decomposition strategies or mining techniques are used.
5. **Integration and aggregation**: After analyzing individual sub-processes, integrating and aggregating the results can be challenging, requiring careful consideration of how to combine the insights and models obtained.
6. **Additional computational effort**: While decomposition can reduce the computational complexity of process mining, it can also introduce additional computational effort, particularly if multiple decomposition steps are required.
7. **Data quality issues**: Decomposition can exacerbate data quality issues, such as noise or missing data, particularly if the sub-processes are analyzed independently.

To overcome these challenges, process mining practitioners can use various techniques, such as:

1. **Hierarchical decomposition**: decomposing the process into smaller sub-processes and then further decomposing those sub-processes, if needed.
2. **Component-based decomposition**: decomposing the process into components, such as activities or
