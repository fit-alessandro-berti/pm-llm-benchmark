**Violations of the Normative Process:**

Based on the event log and the normative process description, the following cases deviate from the intended process flow:

1. **Case ID: 2**
	* Timestamp: 2023-10-06 09:30
	* Activity: Package items
	* Explanation: In this case, the "Package items" step should occur after checking the inventory, but instead, it happens before authorizing payment. This is a violation of the normative process, as payment authorization should only occur after inventory sufficiency is known.
2. **Case ID: 3**
	* Timestamp: 2023-10-07 10:00
	* Activity: Cancel order
	* Explanation: In this case, the cancellation step precedes packaging. However, according to the normative process, packaging should only occur after authorization and before shipping. This is a violation of the normative process.
3. **Case ID: 4**
	* Timestamp: 2023-10-08 09:50
	* Activity: Close order
	* Explanation: This case deviates from the normative process, as the final step "Close order" should only occur after all necessary activities have been completed (in this case, canceling and closing). The "Cancel order" step is unnecessary and can be removed from the process flow.
4. **Case ID: 5**
	* Timestamp: 2023-10-09 11:00
	* Activity: Ship order
	* Explanation: In this case, the "Ship order" step occurs before closing the order, which is not in line with the normative process. The "Ship order" step should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.

**Interpreting Ambiguities:**

* In Case ID: 2, the inventory check and payment authorization should happen in sequence, but in the log, they occur in different order. This might indicate a need for further clarification or interpretation of the normative process.
* In Case ID: 3, the cancellation step is premature, as it happens before packaging. The log might indicate that the order should be canceled and closed as soon as possible after the inventory check, but the normative process implies that packaging should happen after authorization and before shipping.
* In Case ID: 4, the "Cancel order" step seems unnecessary and can be removed from the process flow. The normative process only requires closing the order after all necessary activities have been completed.
* In Case ID: 5, the "Ship order" step occurs before closing the order. While this follows the normative process, it might be more accurate to interpret it as a sign that the order has been completed and is now being finalized, rather than being shipped immediately after closing.
