 To create a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process using pm4py, I will define several activities, operators, and a partial order between them. Here's a simple example:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities in the P2P process
A = Transition(label="Create PO")  # Create Purchase Order
B = Transition(label="Approve PO")  # Approve Purchase Order
C = Transition(label="Order Goods")  # Place an order for goods
D = Transition(label="Receive Goods")  # Receive goods from supplier
E = Transition(label="Invoice Received")  # Invoice received from supplier
F = Transition(label="Verify Invoice")  # Verify the invoice
G = Transition(label="Pay Supplier")  # Pay for the goods and services
H = Transition(label="Record Payment")  # Record the payment
I = Transition(label="Close PO")  # Close Purchase Order
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define a loop between "Verify Invoice" and "Pay Supplier" activities, repeated until the invoice is approved.
verify_pay_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[F, G])

# Define an exclusive choice between "Record Payment" or "Re-verify Invoice" after payment.
record_or_reverify = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[H, Transition(label="Re-Verify Invoice")])

# Create a partial order for the P2P process
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, B, C, D, E, verify_pay_loop, record_or_reverify, I])
root.order.add_edge(A, B)  # Create PO must be completed before Approving it
root.order.add_edge(B, C)  # Approved PO allows ordering of goods
root.order.add_edge(C, D)  # Placing order for goods leads to receiving them
root.order.add_edge(D, E)  # Receiving invoice
root.order.add_edge(E, verify_pay_loop)  # Invoice received needs to be verified and paid (in the loop)
root.order.add_edge(verify_pay_loop, record_or_reverify)  # After finishing verifying and paying, either Record Payment or Re-Verify Invoice can occur.
root.order.add_edge(record_or_reverify, I)  # Finally, the Purchase Order is closed.
```

This code defines a simple P2P POWL model with activities for creating a purchase order (A), approving it (B), ordering goods (C), receiving goods (D), receiving invoice (E), verifying and paying invoices in a loop (verify_pay_loop), an exclusive choice between recording the payment or re-verifying the invoice (record_or_reverify), and closing the purchase order (I).
