Based on the given event log, here's a POWL model representing the global manufacturing and distribution process of high-end appliances:

```plaintext
POWL Model Structure:

1. OR (Order Received)
2. MS (Material Sourcing)
3. QS (Quality Screening)
4. AS (Assembly)
5. IQC (In-line Quality Check, repeated if needed)
6. TST (Testing)
7. RT (Re-Testing) - leads back to TST
8. PK (Packaging)
9. LB (Labeling, optional)
10. DP (Distribution Planning)
11. D (Dispatch)

POWL Structure:

- Start with OR activity

Root: StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR], order={})

  - OR --> MS
  - MS --> QS
  - QS --> AS
  - AS --> IQC
  - IQC has two possible outcomes:
    - Pass: Directly proceed to TST (silent transition)
    - Fail: Proceed back to RT and then TST (* (IQC, RT, TST))
  - TST --> RT if failed test
  - RT --> TST if retesting is needed

  - AS (parallel with IQC) --> PK (concurrent execution)
  - PK has two possible outcomes:
    - Labeling (LB): If present, LB occurs after PK.
    - No labeling (skipped): Directly proceed to DP

    Therefore, the relationship for PK is: PK --> * (LB, DP)

  - DP --> D
```

Explanation:
- The process starts with "Order Received" (OR).
- After receiving an order, material sourcing (MS) follows.
- Quality screening (QS) is then conducted before assembly (AS), which may involve multiple iterations of quality checks (IQC). 
- If a product fails the initial test at TST, it goes back for retesting (RT), and then another round of testing (TST).
- After successful assembly and testing, packaging (PK) takes place. Labeling (LB) is an optional step after PK, happening concurrently with distribution planning (DP). If labeling is skipped, DP begins immediately following PK.
- Once packaging or labeling is completed, the product moves on to distribution planning (DP), then dispatch (D).

The model captures the main flow of activities and includes a loop for retesting when necessary, as well as concurrency between packaging/labeling and distribution planning.
