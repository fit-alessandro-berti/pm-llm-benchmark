# Analysis of POWL Models for the Hire-to-Retire Process

## Standard (Normative) Process

The expected sequence is:
> **Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case**

Each step logically feeds into the next: you screen to shortlist, interview the shortlisted, decide based on interviews, onboard the chosen candidate, register them in payroll, and close.

## Model 1: Anomaly Analysis

**Ordering derived from edges:**
```
Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close
               Interview (no outgoing edges)
```

After `Screen`, both `Decide` and `Interview` are enabled **in parallel**—there is no edge enforcing `Interview  Decide`.

### Anomalies Identified

| # | Anomaly | Severity |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Interview and Decide are concurrent (not ordered).** The hiring decision can be made *before* or *simultaneously with* interviews, rather than being informed by them. | **Moderate–High**: Decisions should be based on interview outcomes. |
| 2 | **Interview is a "dangling" activity.** It has no outgoing edge connecting it to downstream activities. It must eventually execute (partial order semantics require all nodes to complete), but it does not gate the decision or any subsequent step. | **Moderate**: Interview results are structurally irrelevant to the process outcome. |

Despite these issues, **all seven activities are mandatory**, and the core backbone `Post  Screen  …  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close` is intact. The process never skips an essential step.

## Model 2: Anomaly Analysis

**Ordering derived from edges:**
```
Post  Screen (no outgoing edges — dead end)
      Interview  Decide  *(Onboard, skip)  X(Payroll, skip)  Close
```

### Anomalies Identified

| # | Anomaly | Severity |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Screening is completely disconnected from the main decision flow.** `Screen` has no outgoing edges; it runs after `Post` but its results never feed into interviews or the hiring decision. Screening is structurally useless. | **High**: A core filtering step is decoupled from all downstream logic. |
| 2 | **Interviews happen without prior screening.** `Post  Interview` means candidates are interviewed immediately after posting, bypassing the screening step. This violates the fundamental purpose of screening (narrowing the candidate pool). | **High**: Defeats the purpose of having a screening activity. |
| 3 | **Payroll can be entirely skipped** (`X(Payroll, skip)`). An employee can be onboarded and the case closed without ever being added to payroll. | **High**: This is a critical process violation — an employee without payroll registration will not be paid. |
| 4 | **Onboarding is modeled as a loop** (`*(Onboard, skip)`). While onboarding can repeat (which could be interpreted as multiple orientation sessions), there's no clear business rationale for looping onboarding in a standard hire process. | **Low**: Unusual but not fundamentally harmful; could represent re-orientation scenarios. |

## Verdict: Model 1 Is Closer to the Normative Process

### Justification

| Criterion | Model 1 | Model 2 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **All activities mandatory?** |  Yes — every step must execute |  No — Payroll can be skipped |
| **Screening informs later steps?** |  Yes — `Screen` precedes both `Interview` and `Decide` |  No — `Screen` is a dead-end node |
| **Core sequence preserved?** |  Mostly — backbone is intact, only `Interview` placement is off |  No — screening is disconnected, payroll is optional |
| **Severity of anomalies** | Moderate — ordering issue between Interview and Decide | **Severe** — multiple fundamental violations |

**Model 1's anomaly** (interview/decide parallelism) is a *sequencing* problem: the right activities are all present and required, but one ordering constraint is missing. This could be fixed by adding a single edge (`Interview  Decide`).

**Model 2's anomalies** are *structural and semantic*: a core activity (Screening) is rendered meaningless, another essential step (Payroll) can be skipped entirely, and the logical dependency chain (Screen  Interview  Decide) is broken. These represent fundamental violations of the Hire-to-Retire process's integrity.

> **Conclusion:** **Model 1** more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process. Its single anomaly (lack of ordering between Interview and Decide) is a relatively contained flaw, whereas Model 2 undermines the process at multiple critical points.
