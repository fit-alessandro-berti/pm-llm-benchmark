The diagram is a control-flow model of a (ticket-refund) business process.  
Two different graphical elements are used.

1. Activities (work that is actually carried out)  
   • shown as rounded rectangles, each one with a letter identifier and a short label  
     a  register request  
     b  examine thoroughly  
     c  examine casually  
     d  check ticket  
     e  decide  
     f  re-initiate request  
     g  pay compensation  
     h  reject request  
     z  end

2. Routing nodes (black dots)  
   • purely logical connectors that determine how cases branch or merge.  
   • The legend in the grey panel explains the three routing types:
     XOR  (exclusive choice / exclusive merge)  
     AND  (parallel split / parallel join)  
     OR   (inclusive choice / inclusive merge)

   Each type can occur as a split (one incoming, several outgoing arcs) or a
   join (several incoming, one outgoing arc).  
   The way the dots are arranged in the legend shows how to recognise the three
   kinds of splits and joins.

How the process runs

1. A case starts with activity a “register request”.  
   – the XOR-split after a chooses exactly one of three
     alternative examinations: b “examine thoroughly”,  
     c “examine casually”, or  
     d “check ticket”.

2. The three examination activities are mutually exclusive but may be repeated:
   – from e “decide” an OR-split can send the case back to any of the three
     examinations or to f “re-initiate request”, creating the loops you can
     see around the examinations.

3. When e finishes and no further re-examination is required, an XOR-split
   chooses one of two end-states:  
   • g “pay compensation” or  
   • h “reject request”.

4. Either g or h leads to the XOR-join in front of z “end”, after which the
   process terminates.

Reading the routing nodes

• Single dot after a with three outgoing arrows = XOR-split (only one branch is
  taken).  
• Three incoming arrows merging into one dot in front of e = XOR-join (the
  paths are mutually exclusive, so only one token will arrive).  
• The bundle of outgoing dots after e = OR-split (one or several branches may
  be taken simultaneously, hence the possibility to revisit earlier steps).  
• The pair of incoming arrows that meet before z = XOR-join again.

In short, the picture is an event-driven process chain / Petri-net-style model
that shows how a request is registered, possibly examined several times, then
either compensated or rejected, and finally ends, with explicit notation for
exclusive, parallel and inclusive routing.
