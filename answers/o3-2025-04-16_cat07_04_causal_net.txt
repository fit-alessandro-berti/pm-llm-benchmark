What you see is a processflow model that mixes

• activity boxes (rounded rectangles)  
• small, solid black circles that play the role of controlflow “gateways” (splits/joins)  
• directed arcs that show the ordering of work

The legend in the grey pane explains what the black circles mean:

• one incoming, several outgoing arcsXORsplit (exclusive choice)  
• one incoming, several outgoing arcs that are meant to fire in parallelANDsplit  
• one incoming, several outgoing arcs where any nonempty subset may fireORsplit  

• the same three types in the opposite direction (several incoming, one outgoing) give the corresponding XOR, AND and ORjoins.

Process logic (upper, larger picture)

1. a  “register request”  
   – After a new request is registered, an XORsplit decides which of three examinations will be performed.

2. Three mutually exclusive examination paths  
   b  “examine thoroughly”  
   c  “examine casually”  
   d  “check ticket”  
   – Each box is reached through its own branch.  
   – After any one of the three is completed the paths are merged again in an XORjoin.

3. e  “decide”  
   – A decision is taken on the basis of the examination result.  
   – There is a selfloop (via the ORsplit and task f) that allows the request to be reinitiated if extra work is needed.

4. f  “reinitiate request”  
   – If the request must be reopened, control returns to the very first task a, forming a loop.

5. Result handling  
   – An XORsplit after “decide” leads to one of two mutually exclusive endings:  
     g  “pay compensation” (positive result)  
     h  “reject request”  (negative result)

6. z  “end”  
   – Both result paths converge in an XORjoin that leads to the single end state.

What the visualization communicates

• It is a Petrinetstyle (or EPCstyle) controlflow view of a business process for handling some sort of customer claim or compensation request.  
• The legend lets you read any blackcircle construct in the model as XOR, AND or OR behaviour, so the semantics are unambiguous.  
• There is exactly one overt cycle: decide  reinitiate request  register request, enabling rework until a definitive payorreject outcome is reached.
