Event abstraction is a technique used to simplify complex process models by grouping related events into higher-level, abstract events. This concept can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs in the following ways:

1. **Reducing the number of nodes and edges**: By aggregating related events into abstract events, the number of nodes and edges in the process model can be significantly reduced, making it easier to visualize and understand.
2. **Increasing the level of abstraction**: Event abstraction allows process analysts to focus on the essential aspects of the process, hiding low-level details that are not crucial for understanding the overall process flow.
3. **Improving model readability**: Abstract events can be labeled with meaningful names, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the process model and identify patterns and relationships.
4. **Enhancing model maintainability**: Event abstraction facilitates model updates and modifications, as changes can be made at the abstract level without affecting the underlying event log data.
5. **Facilitating process comparison**: Abstract events enable the comparison of different process models, highlighting similarities and differences between them.
6. **Enabling pattern discovery**: Event abstraction can reveal patterns and structures in the process data that may not be apparent at the individual event level.

To effectively utilize event abstraction, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Identify related events**: Group events that share common characteristics, such as similar activity names, resources, or data attributes.
2. **Define abstract events**: Create abstract events that represent the grouped events, using meaningful names and descriptions.
3. **Map events to abstract events**: Establish a mapping between the original events and the abstract events, ensuring that the abstraction is consistent and accurate.
4. **Validate the abstraction**: Verify that the abstract events accurately represent the underlying process, using techniques such as event log analysis and process simulation.
5. **Refine the abstraction**: Iterate on the abstraction, refining the grouping and mapping of events to abstract events as needed.

Some popular techniques for event abstraction include:

1. **Event clustering**: Grouping similar events based on their attributes and behavior.
2. **Event aggregation**: Combining multiple events into a single abstract event, often using statistical or machine learning techniques.
3. **Event generalization**: Abstracting events by removing low-level details and retaining only the essential information.
4. **Event specialization**: Creating abstract events that represent specific subsets of events, often based on domain knowledge or process requirements.

By applying event abstraction techniques, process analysts can create more readable, maintainable,
