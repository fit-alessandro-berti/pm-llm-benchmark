## 1) Cases with significantly longer completion times (end-to-end)

Compute **lead time = Close Claim timestamp  Submit Claim timestamp**:

- **Case 2001 (Region A, Low):** 2024-04-01 09:00  10:30 = **1h 30m**
- **Case 2004 (Region B, Low):** 2024-04-01 09:20  10:45 = **1h 25m**
- **Case 2002 (Region B, Medium):** 2024-04-01 09:05  2024-04-02 11:00 = **25h 55m**
- **Case 2003 (Region A, High):** 2024-04-01 09:10  2024-04-03 09:30 = **48h 20m**
- **Case 2005 (Region B, High):** 2024-04-01 09:25  2024-04-04 14:30 = **77h 05m**

**Performance issue cases:** **2002, 2003, 2005**, with **2005** the most severe outlier.

## 2) Attribute-based root cause analysis (Resource, Region, Complexity)

### A) Complexity strongly correlates with long duration
- **Low complexity (2001, 2004):** ~**1.5 hours** and no “Request Additional Documents”.
- **Medium (2002):** ~**26 hours** with **1** “Request Additional Documents” and an overnight wait.
- **High (2003, 2005):** **48h+** with **multiple** “Request Additional Documents” and multi-day waiting.

**Mechanism:** High complexity drives:
1) more back-and-forth for missing/unclear documentation, and  
2) longer waits before approval and payment (likely due to escalations, queues, or dependency on external responses).

### B) “Request Additional Documents” loops are the main driver (rework / waiting)
Count of document requests:
- **2002 (Medium):** 1 request (at 14:00)  approval next day 10:00 (**~20h** gap mainly waiting)
- **2003 (High):** 2 requests (11:00, 17:00)  approval next day 16:00 (**~23h** gap from last request to approve)
- **2005 (High):** 3 requests (11:30, next day 17:00, next day 15:00)  approve on 04-04 10:00 (**very large cumulative waiting**)

This indicates the dominant delay is **not the internal activity execution time** (which is usually minutes), but **idle time between events**, especially between:
- **Request Additional Documents  next Request / Approve**
- **Approve  Pay** (not huge here, but noticeable in 2003/2005)

### C) Resource signal: Adjuster_Lisa appears in the longest case and repeated rework
Cases with **Adjuster_Lisa** as evaluator/requester:
- **2004 (Low):** fast (no doc requests)
- **2002 (Medium):** 1 doc request, ~26h total
- **2005 (High):** 3 doc requests, **77h** total (worst)

This suggests a **risk pattern when Adjuster_Lisa handles higher-complexity claims** (not necessarily poor performance—could be she gets the hardest cases, or her region has stricter requirements). Still, the *repeated* doc requests point to either:
- insufficient upfront document checklist/triage, or
- inconsistent document quality checks before requesting, or
- communication delays with claimants in those assignments.

For **Adjuster_Mike**:
- **2001 (Low):** fast
- **2003 (High):** 2 doc requests, 48h total  
High complexity still causes delays, but fewer loops than 2005.

### D) Region effect: Region B shows more severe delay at high complexity
Compare high complexity:
- **Region A, High (2003):** 48h 20m, 2 doc requests
- **Region B, High (2005):** 77h 05m, 3 doc requests

Region B also has the **Medium** case (2002) with overnight delay. While the sample is small, **Region B + (Medium/High)** looks slower, likely due to:
- different regulatory/verification requirements,
- staffing/queueing constraints,
- different claimant population behavior (slower document turnaround),
- different operating hours / handoffs.

## 3) Explanations + mitigation suggestions

### Root cause 1: High complexity increases rework (document requests) and waiting
**Why it happens**
- High-complexity claims often need more evidence (police reports, medical docs, invoices, photos, third-party statements).
- Missing items discovered late triggers multiple “Request Additional Documents” cycles.

**Mitigations**
- Introduce a **complexity-based intake checklist**: if Complexity=High, require a standardized “minimum document bundle” before evaluation begins.
- Add a **pre-validation/triage step** right after submission to check completeness (reduce later rework).
- Use **one consolidated request** (bundle missing items) rather than multiple sequential requests.

### Root cause 2: Document turnaround time (external waiting) dominates cycle time
**Why it happens**
- Claimant response time and third-party documents cause long idle periods.
- Re-requests imply unclear instructions or partial submissions.

**Mitigations**
- Set **SLAs and automated reminders** (e.g., 24h/48h nudges).
- Improve request quality: **structured templates**, examples, “upload portal” with required fields.
- Provide **assisted channels** (call-back, chat) for high-complexity claimants to reduce incomplete submissions.

### Root cause 3: Region B (especially for Medium/High) may have capacity or policy bottlenecks
**Why it happens**
- Different workload volume, fewer adjusters, or stricter compliance checks.
- More handoffs or batching behavior (e.g., approvals only processed at certain times).

**Mitigations**
- Compare **WIP and staffing** between regions; rebalance workload or cross-train to share queues.
- Standardize decision rules and documentation requirements across regions where possible.
- Monitor region-level KPIs: **time in queue**, **doc request rate**, **# of cycles per case**.

### Root cause 4: Resource-level pattern for repeated document requests (notably in Case 2005)
**Why it happens**
- Could be skill/experience gaps, unclear criteria, or simply assignment of the hardest cases.
- Could also be a “quality gate” issue: documents arrive but are not acceptable, causing repeated requests.

**Mitigations**
- Track per-adjuster metrics: **avg # doc requests**, **first-time-right rate**, **time from doc receipt to approve**.
- Coaching or playbooks for handling high complexity; peer review for the first doc request in High cases.
- If workload-related, cap concurrent high-complexity cases per adjuster.

## Quick summary
- **Long cases:** **2002 (~26h), 2003 (~48h), 2005 (~77h)**; worst is **2005**.
- **Primary driver:** **Complexity  more “Request Additional Documents” loops  long waiting time**.
- **Secondary signals:** **Region B** appears slower for non-low complexity; **Adjuster_Lisa** is associated with the worst looping pattern in the high-complexity case.
- **Best fixes:** reduce rework via **upfront completeness checks + bundled document requests**, improve claimant turnaround with **automation and clearer requests**, and investigate **Region B capacity/policy differences** plus **resource-level variation** in document-request cycles.
