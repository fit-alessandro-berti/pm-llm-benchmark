**Solution:**

Based on the provided sample events and considering the patterns of temporal proximity, logical sequence, and the involvement of common resources:

### High-Level Steps:
1. **Material Preparation:**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

   **Rationale:** These events are temporally close and involve preparing the material before moving to the next phase of assembly. They ensure that the necessary components are ready for welding, which is a subsequent step.

2. **Welding Assembly:**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B

   **Rationale:** The pick-up and use of the welding tool indicate a phase where physical work on assembling the product takes place. These actions are directly followed by applying welds, indicating an assembly step.

3. **Quality Assessment:**
   - Measure weld integrity
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating
   - Visual check

   **Rationale:** These events are all related to ensuring that the product meets quality standards before it moves on to the final stage. They involve inspecting and treating the product, which is a critical phase in the manufacturing process.

### Final Aggregated Process Steps:
1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Welding Assembly**
3. **Quality Assessment**

This high-level representation captures the logical flow of activities from initial preparation to final inspection and quality check, making it easier to understand the manufacturing process at a glance. Each step is justified by its sequential nature and the common resources involved, which align with typical stages in similar industrial processes.
