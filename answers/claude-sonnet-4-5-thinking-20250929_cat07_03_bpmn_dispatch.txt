# Business Process Diagram Description

This is a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram** illustrating a shipping and logistics workflow. The process is organized into three swim lanes representing different organizational areas:

## Swim Lanes (Top to Bottom):
1. **Logistics**
2. **Secretary/Computer Hardware Shop**
3. **Warehouse**

## Process Flow:

### Starting Point:
- Begins with a **"Ship goods"** start event in the Secretary lane

### Main Process Steps:

**Secretary/Order Processing Lane:**
- **Clarify shipment method** - determining how goods will be shipped
- **Decision gateway**: "Special handling?" with yes/no branches
  - "No" path: proceeds to order details
  - "Yes" path: leads to getting logistics quotes
- **Get 3 offers from logistic companies**
- **Check if insurance is required** (connected to Customer information database)
- **Select logistic company and place order**

**Logistics Lane:**
- **Insure parcel** - executed when insurance is necessary
- **Write package label** - always performed after insurance check

**Warehouse Lane:**
- **Package goods** - includes a 48-hour timer event
- **Notify customer about delay** - triggered if packaging exceeds time limit
- **Fill out Shipment paperwork**
- **Move package to pickup area**
- Ends with **"Shipment prepared"** end event

## Key Elements:
- **Gateways** (diamonds) showing decision points and process merges
- **Data objects**: Customer information database and Order details document
- **Timer event**: 48-hour constraint on packaging
- Multiple parallel and sequential flows coordinating across departments
