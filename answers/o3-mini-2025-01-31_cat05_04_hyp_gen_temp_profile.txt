Below is an independent analysis of the process anomalies, possible underlying reasons, and sample SQL queries to help verify them:

  
Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

•Between Receive (R) and Approve (P):  
– Observed average time is about 25 hours with a very low standard deviation (±1 hour).  
– This narrow spread is unexpected for a process that might usually involve variable review times.  

•Between Approve (P) and Notify (N):  
– The average delay is extremely long (7 days) with a significant variation (±2 days).  
– Such a long wait might suggest that notifications are either batched or affected by external resource constraints.  

•Between Assign (A) and Close (C):  
– An average of only 2 hours may indicate that some claims are closed immediately after assignment—possibly bypassing intermediate steps like evaluation and approval.  

•Between Evaluate (E) and Notify (N):  
– An extremely short interval (5 minutes on average) may imply automated steps, a rushed process, or even that crucial intermediate checks are omitted.

  
Hypotheses on the Root Causes

•For R to P (short duration with low variability):  
– The approval step might be automated or scheduled to happen at fixed intervals regardless of claim complexity.  
– There could be a system-triggered routine that forces approvals after a set waiting period, reducing natural variation.  

•For P to N (long delay with high variability):  
– Notification might be handled manually or by an external system that experiences backlogs.  
– Back-office resource limitations or administrative batching might delay customer notifications.  
– In some cases, this delay might be purposeful (e.g., waiting for additional documentation or verification before notifying the customer).  

•For A to C (rapid closure):  
– Claims may be getting closed prematurely due to system errors or misclassification.  
– Incomplete process flows might lead adjusters to incorrectly mark the claim closed without full evaluation.  

•For E to N (very rapid notification):  
– The transition between evaluation and notification might be fully automated, possibly bypassing additional scrutiny or customer review.  
– Alternatively, logging issues or process shortcuts might be resulting in unrealistic timestamps.

  
Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. Detecting anomalously short or long durations for a claim between two activities:

Example – Identify claims with an unusual R to P (Receive to Approve) interval:
-----------------------------------------------------  
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
        (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))
    ) AS r_to_p_duration_seconds
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
         (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - 
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))
       ) NOT BETWEEN 72000 AND 90000;  
-----------------------------------------------------  
(The threshold here is set, for example, to flag values significantly different from the expected 25 hours; adjust the range as needed.)

2. Finding claims where the P to N (Approve to Notify) delay is exceptionally long:

-----------------------------------------------------  
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
        (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))
    ) AS p_to_n_duration_seconds
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
         (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - 
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))
       ) > 700000;  
-----------------------------------------------------  
(This query flags claims where the delay significantly exceeds the expected 7 days (7*24*3600 seconds), indicating a potential backlog.)

3. Checking for claims that are closed too quickly after assignment (A to C), possibly skipping other events:

-----------------------------------------------------  
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
        (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))
    ) AS a_to_c_duration_seconds
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
         (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - 
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))
       ) < 7200;  
-----------------------------------------------------  
(Here, claims closed in less than 2 hours after assignment are flagged, as it may be an indication of premature closure.)

4. Evaluating the E to N (Evaluate to Notify) transition to verify if the interval is consistently too short:

-----------------------------------------------------  
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
        (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - 
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END))
    ) AS e_to_n_duration_seconds
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
         (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - 
          MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END))
       ) < 300;  
-----------------------------------------------------  
(This query retrieves claims where the evaluation-to-notification period is less than the expected 5 minutes, flagging potential logging errors or rushed transitions.)

5. Correlating anomalies with other dimensions (such as adjusters or claim types):

For example, correlate delayed P to N durations by claim type:
-----------------------------------------------------  
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))) AS avg_p_to_n_duration_seconds,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count
FROM claims c
JOIN (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
) p ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id
JOIN (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'N'
) n ON c.claim_id = n.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY avg_p_to_n_duration_seconds DESC;  
-----------------------------------------------------  
(This query helps determine if certain claim types experience disproportionately high delays in notifications.)

  
These queries and hypotheses provide a starting point to investigate the unusual activity intervals observed in the temporal profile model. Adjust thresholds and filters as needed based on further process insights or evolving business rules.
