### Anomalies Identified  
1. **R  P (Receive to Approve):** Unusually low standard deviation (1 hour) despite an average of ~25 hours.  
2. **P  N (Approve to Notify):** Excessively long average time (7 days) with high variability (STDEV = 2 days).  
3. **A  C (Assign to Close):** Short average time (2 hours) without intermediate steps like Evaluate or Approve.  
4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):** Suspiciously fast transition (5 minutes on average).  

---

### Hypotheses for Anomalies  
1. **R  P (Rigid Approval Timing):**  
   - Approvals may be automated or scheduled at fixed intervals, bypassing actual evaluation.  
   - Adjusters might be pre-approving claims without proper scrutiny.  

2. **P  N (Notification Delays):**  
   - Manual approval-to-notify handoffs could cause bottlenecks (e.g., understaffed teams).  
   - Notifications might depend on external systems with inconsistent latency.  

3. **A  C (Premature Closures):**  
   - Adjusters might close claims immediately after assignment due to errors (e.g., duplicate claims).  
   - Automated systems could incorrectly skip evaluation steps for certain claim types.  

4. **E  N (Instant Notifications):**  
   - Notifications may be auto-triggered upon evaluation, even if human review is required.  
   - Evaluate and Notify steps might be conflated in the data (e.g., same timestamp).

### SQL Verification Queries  

#### 1. **Check Rigid R  P Approval Intervals**  
```sql  
WITH receive_approve_times AS (
  SELECT 
    r.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS time_diff
  FROM 
    claim_events r
    JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
  WHERE 
    r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  time_diff
FROM 
  receive_approve_times
WHERE 
  ABS(time_diff - 90000) > 3600 * 3  -- Flag claims >3 STDEVs from the mean
ORDER BY 
  time_diff DESC;
```  

**Purpose:** Identify claims where approval occurs at exactly ~25 hours, suggesting automation or fixed scheduling.  

---

#### 2. **Investigate P  N Notification Delays**  
```sql  
SELECT 
  p.claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds,
  c.claim_type,
  a.region
FROM 
  claim_events p
  JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
  JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
  LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = CAST(n.resource AS INTEGER)
WHERE 
  p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
  AND (n.timestamp - p.timestamp) > INTERVAL '7 days 4 hours'  -- >7 days + 2 STDEVs
```  

**Purpose:** Find claims with prolonged approval-to-notify times and correlate with region or claim type.  

---

#### 3. **Detect Premature A  C Closures**  
```sql  
SELECT 
  a.claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_seconds,
  adj.specialization,
  COUNT(e.event_id) AS num_evaluate_events
FROM 
  claim_events a
  JOIN claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
  LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
  JOIN adjusters adj ON adj.adjuster_id = CAST(a.resource AS INTEGER)
WHERE 
  a.activity = 'A' AND c.activity = 'C'
  AND (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) < INTERVAL '1 hour'  -- Quicker than average
GROUP BY 
  a.claim_id, a_to_c_seconds, adj.specialization;
```  

**Purpose:** Identify adjusters/closing claims too quickly and check if evaluation steps are missing.  

---

#### 4. **Validate E  N Instant Transitions**  
```sql  
SELECT 
  e.claim_id,
  e.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
  n.timestamp AS notify_time,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_seconds,
  e.resource AS evaluator,
  n.resource AS notifier
FROM 
  claim_events e
  JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE 
  e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
  AND (n.timestamp - e.timestamp) < INTERVAL '1 minute'  -- Near-instant transitions
```  

**Purpose:** Detect claims where notification follows evaluation within 1 minute, suggesting automation or data entry errors.

### Correlation Analysis  
To link anomalies to external factors, add joins to `claims` or `adjusters` in the above queries and filter by:  
- `claim_type` (e.g., auto vs. home insurance).  
- `adjuster_id` or `specialization`.  
- `region` (e.g., delays concentrated in specific geographies).  
- `additional_info` (e.g., notes indicating system overrides).
