### Anomalies Identified

1. **R  P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Average:** ~25 hours, **STDEV:** 1 hour.  
   - **Anomaly:** Extremely low standard deviation for a 25-hour average, suggesting rigid or artificial scheduling.  

2. **P  N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Average:** 7 days, **STDEV:** 2 days.  
   - **Anomaly:** Excessively long average delay with high variability, indicating inconsistent post-approval processes.  

3. **A  C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Average:** 2 hours, **STDEV:** 1 hour.  
   - **Anomaly:** Claims closed too quickly after assignment, potentially skipping critical steps.  

4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Average:** 5 minutes, **STDEV:** 1 minute.  
   - **Anomaly:** Unnaturally rapid transition, possibly indicating skipped steps or mislogged timestamps.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R  P Rigid Timing:**  
   - Automated systems may enforce fixed approval schedules, overriding actual evaluation times.  
   - Adjusters might approve claims in batches at specific times, regardless of submission time.  

2. **P  N Long Delay:**  
   - Manual notification processes could cause delays due to resource shortages or backlogs.  
   - Notifications for certain claim types (e.g., high-value) may require additional approvals, creating variability.  

3. **A  C Premature Closure:**  
   - Adjusters might close claims without evaluation due to invalid claims (e.g., duplicates) or system errors.  
   - Auto-closure rules (e.g., for claims below a threshold) may bypass standard steps.  

4. **E  N Rapid Transition:**  
   - Notifications could be auto-triggered immediately after evaluation, even if manual steps are pending.  
   - Evaluation timestamps might be logged inaccurately (e.g., pre-dated).

### Verification SQL Queries

#### 1. Check Claims with Suspiciously Uniform R  P Timing
```sql
WITH r_to_p AS (
  SELECT 
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS time_diff
  FROM claim_events r
  JOIN claim_events p 
    ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id 
    AND r.activity = 'R' 
    AND p.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  time_diff
FROM r_to_p
WHERE time_diff BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600  -- 24-26 hours
ORDER BY time_diff;
```

#### 2. Identify Claims with Extreme P  N Delays
```sql
SELECT 
  p.claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds,
  c.claim_type,
  a.region
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n 
  ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id 
  AND p.activity = 'P' 
  AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id
WHERE n.timestamp - p.timestamp > INTERVAL '9 days';  -- 7 days avg + 2 days stdev
```

#### 3. Detect Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment
```sql
SELECT 
  a.claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_seconds,
  adj.specialization,
  c.claim_type
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events c 
  ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id 
  AND a.activity = 'A' 
  AND c.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN claim_events e 
  ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id 
  AND e.activity = 'E'  -- Ensure no evaluation step exists
JOIN claims cl ON a.claim_id = cl.claim_id
JOIN adjusters adj ON cl.customer_id = adj.adjuster_id
WHERE e.event_id IS NULL 
  AND (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) < INTERVAL '3 hours';  -- 2 hours avg + 1 stdev
```

#### 4. Validate E  N Consistency Across Adjusters
```sql
SELECT 
  e.resource AS adjuster_id,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))) AS avg_e_to_n,
  COUNT(*) AS total_claims
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n 
  ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id 
  AND e.activity = 'E' 
  AND n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY e.resource
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))) < 300  -- 5 minutes avg
ORDER BY avg_e_to_n;
```
