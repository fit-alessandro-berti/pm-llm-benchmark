### Identified Anomalies

1. **R  P (Receive to Approve)**:  
   - **Anomaly**: Extremely low standard deviation (1 hour) despite an average of ~25 hours.  
   - **Hypotheses**:  
     - Approval is artificially scheduled (e.g., batch processing at fixed times).  
     - Automated rules bypass evaluation steps for specific claim types.  
     - Timestamps for approvals are manually overridden.  

2. **P  N (Approve to Notify)**:  
   - **Anomaly**: Long average delay (7 days) with high variability (2 days STDEV).  
   - **Hypotheses**:  
     - Manual notification processes cause inconsistent delays.  
     - Notifications are deprioritized or backlogged after approval.  
     - External dependencies (e.g., third-party systems) introduce delays.  

3. **A  C (Assign to Close)**:  
   - **Anomaly**: Claims close quickly (2 hours on average) after assignment.  
   - **Hypotheses**:  
     - Adjusters skip evaluation/approval steps for low-amount claims.  
     - System errors auto-close claims prematurely.  
     - Claims are reassigned but not properly logged.  

4. **E  N (Evaluate to Notify)**:  
   - **Anomaly**: Near-instantaneous notification (5 minutes on average).  
   - **Hypotheses**:  
     - Automated notifications trigger immediately after evaluation.  
     - Missing approval steps compress the timeline.  
     - Timestamps for evaluation and notification are logged inaccurately.

### Verification SQL Queries

#### 1. Check for Rigid R  P Approval Timing  
Find claims where approval occurs exactly 25 hours after receipt:  
```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_seconds
FROM
    (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'R') r
JOIN
    (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P') p
    ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) BETWEEN 90000 - 3600 AND 90000 + 3600;  -- ±1 hour from average
```

#### 2. Investigate P  N Delays  
Identify claims with notification delays exceeding 10 days:  
```sql
SELECT
    p.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds,
    c.claim_amount,
    a.region
FROM
    (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'P') p
JOIN
    (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'N') n
    ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'A' AND resource = a.adjuster_id
)
WHERE
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 10 * 86400;  -- >10 days
```

#### 3. Detect Premature A  C Closures  
Find claims closed without evaluation or approval:  
```sql
SELECT
    a.claim_id,
    a.resource AS adjuster_id,
    c.claim_type
FROM
    (SELECT claim_id, resource, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'A') a
JOIN
    (SELECT claim_id, timestamp FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C') c_close
    ON a.claim_id = c_close.claim_id
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P')) steps
    ON a.claim_id = steps.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE
    steps.claim_id IS NULL  -- No evaluate/approve steps
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_close.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < 7200;  -- <2 hours
```

#### 4. Validate E  N Automation  
Check if notifications are automated (via `resource` field):  
```sql
SELECT
    e.claim_id,
    e.resource AS evaluator,
    n.resource AS notifier,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_seconds
FROM
    (SELECT claim_id, timestamp, resource FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'E') e
JOIN
    (SELECT claim_id, timestamp, resource FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'N') n
    ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 300  -- <5 minutes
    AND n.resource LIKE '%system%';  -- Look for automated resources
```

### Correlation Analysis  
To link anomalies to specific adjusters, regions, or claim types:  
```sql
-- Example: Adjusters with frequent A  C closures
SELECT
    a.adjuster_id,
    a.name,
    COUNT(*) AS premature_closures
FROM
    adjusters a
JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
JOIN (
    SELECT claim_id
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'C'
    AND claim_id NOT IN (SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P'))
) c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'A'
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name
ORDER BY premature_closures DESC;
```
