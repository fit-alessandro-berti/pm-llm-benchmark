<think>
Okay, I need to create an accepting Petri net for this insurance claim management process. Let me think through the steps.

First, the scenario describes a sequence of activities with possible loops. The main steps are C  CR  DV  (RDS if needed)  FC  (II if needed)  CA  AP (if needed)  P  N  CL. The initial marking should have a token in the start place, which is probably the "Insurance Claim (C)" place. The final marking should be when the claim is closed (CL).

Let me outline the places and transitions. Each activity should be a transition, and the places represent the states between them. So:

Places:
- C (start)
- CR (after Claim Registration)
- DV (after Document Verification)
- RDS (Re-Document Submission)
- FC (after Fraud Check)
- II (In-depth Investigation)
- CA (Claim Assessment)
- AP (Approval)
- P (Payment)
- N (Notification)
- CL (Closure)

Wait, but in Petri nets, places are the states. So transitions are the activities. Let me structure it properly.

Transitions are the activities: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL. Also, maybe the start and end are places with tokens.

Wait, the initial marking is a token in the start place, which would be the "Insurance Claim (C)" state. So the first transition is Claim Registration (CR), which would consume the token from C and produce a token in CR.

Then, from CR, the next is DV. But after DV, if documents are incomplete, we go to RDS. So the DV transition would lead to a place that can either go to RDS or proceed to FC. Hmm, but how to model the possible loop between DV and RDS.

In Petri nets, loops can be modeled by having arcs that allow the token to return to a previous place. For example, after DV, the process can go to RDS (if needed), then back to DV again. Wait, no, maybe after RDS, the process returns to DV. So the structure would be:

DV is a place. The transition DV would be the Document Verification. Then, after that, if documents are incomplete, we go to RDS. But how to model that. Maybe the DV transition is followed by a place that has two outgoing transitions: one to RDS and one to FC. But I need to think about the flow.

Alternatively, the process is:

C  CR  DV  (RDS  DV)*  FC  (II  FC)*  CA  (AP if needed)  P  N  CL.

So, the DV place has a transition to RDS, which then leads back to DV. Similarly, FC has a transition to II, which leads back to FC.

So, the places would be:

- C (initial)
- CR
- DV
- RDS
- FC
- II
- CA
- AP
- P
- N
- CL (final)

Transitions would be:

- CR (Claim Registration)
- DV (Document Verification)
- RDS (Re-Document Submission)
- FC (Fraud Check)
- II (In-depth Investigation)
- CA (Claim Assessment)
- AP (Approval)
- P (Payment)
- N (Notification)
- CL (Closure)

Wait, but transitions are the activities. So the transitions are labeled with the activity names. So for example, the transition for Document Verification is DV, which would consume a token from DV place and produce a token in the next place. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In Petri nets, transitions represent events. The places represent the states. So for example, the initial place is C. Then, the transition CR is the event of Claim Registration. So the CR transition would consume a token from C and produce a token in CR place. Then, the transition DV consumes a token from CR and produces a token in DV place. Then, the DV transition (activity) would be followed by either RDS or FC. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

- Place C (initial)
- Transition CR: connects C to CR place.
- Place CR
- Transition DV: connects CR to DV place.
- Place DV
- Transition RDS: connects DV to RDS place (but then RDS would have a transition back to DV, allowing loops)
- Place RDS
- Transition DV (again?) Wait, no. Maybe the RDS transition leads back to DV place. So after RDS, the process returns to DV.

Wait, the steps are: after DV, if documents are incomplete, go to RDS. Then after RDS, go back to DV. So the transitions would be:

From DV place, there's a transition to RDS place (transition RDS). Then from RDS place, there's a transition back to DV place (transition DV?), but that might be confusing. Alternatively, the RDS is a transition that consumes a token from DV and produces a token in RDS. Then, there's a transition from RDS to DV again. But how to model that.

Alternatively, the DV transition is followed by a place that can lead to either RDS or FC. Let me think of the structure as:

After DV (place), there's a transition to RDS (place) which is part of a loop. So:

- DV place has an arc to transition RDS. Then, RDS place has an arc to transition back to DV. So the process can loop between DV and RDS as needed.

But then, how to proceed from RDS to the next step. Wait, maybe after RDS, the process goes back to DV. So after RDS is done, the token is back in DV, and then the process can proceed to FC. So the transitions would be:

- Transition RDS: from DV to RDS place (but that's not right). Wait, transitions are the activities. So the transition for RDS is the activity of re-submitting documents. So the transition RDS would have input place DV and output place RDS. Then, another transition (maybe DV again?) from RDS to DV. Wait, but that would be a loop.

Alternatively, the transition RDS is followed by a transition that goes back to the DV place. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline the places and transitions again.

Let me try to model the process step by step:

Start with C (initial place with token). The first transition is CR, which consumes C and produces a token in CR place.

Then, from CR place, the transition DV is fired, consuming the token from CR and producing a token in DV place.

Now, in DV place, there are two possibilities:

1. If documents are complete, proceed to FC. So there's a transition from DV to FC (transition FC? No, the transition is the activity. So maybe the transition is labeled as 'Proceed to FC' but that's not part of the scenario. The scenario says that after DV, if documents are incomplete, RDS is done. So the DV place would have two outgoing transitions: one to RDS (if documents are incomplete) and one to FC (if they are complete). Wait, but in Petri nets, transitions are events. So the process would have a transition that allows moving from DV to RDS (RDS activity) and another that allows moving from DV to FC (but that's not an activity, but maybe the DV activity is followed by FC? No, the DV activity is done once. Then, after that, if documents are incomplete, the process goes to RDS. So perhaps the DV transition is followed by a place that can go to RDS or FC. Wait, maybe I need to model this with a split in the Petri net.

Let me think of it as:

After DV is done (i.e., the token is in DV place), there are two possible transitions:

- One transition (RDS) that takes the token to RDS place. Then, after RDS is done (i.e., the token is in RDS place), it goes back to DV place (so the transition from RDS to DV).

- Another transition (say, to FC) that takes the token from DV to FC place.

So the structure would be:

DV place has two outgoing transitions: RDS and FC. But FC is not an activity here. Wait, the FC is the Fraud Check activity. So after DV, the next step is to do Fraud Check (FC), but if documents are incomplete, then RDS is done first.

Wait, maybe the DV transition is followed by a choice between RDS and FC. So the DV place has two outgoing transitions: one to RDS (transition RDS) and one to FC (transition FC). Then, the RDS transition leads to RDS place, which has a transition back to DV place (so the loop). The FC transition leads to FC place.

So the Petri net would have:

- Places: C, CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

- Transitions: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Wait, but the transitions are the activities. So for example, the transition CR is the activity of Claim Registration. The transition DV is the activity of Document Verification. Then, after DV, if documents are incomplete, the process goes to RDS (Re-Document Submission), which is a transition. So the transition RDS would consume a token from DV and produce a token in RDS place. Then, after RDS is done, the process returns to DV, which would require a transition from RDS to DV. So that transition would be labeled as something else, but the scenario doesn't mention it. Maybe it's an implicit transition.

Wait, but in the scenario, the RDS is a step that occurs before proceeding to DV again. So after RDS is done, the process goes back to DV. So the transition after RDS would be a transition that leads back to DV. But what's the activity name for that? The scenario doesn't mention it, but maybe it's just a transition that allows the loop.

Alternatively, the RDS transition leads to a place that then allows a transition back to DV. But that's getting complicated. Let's think of the transitions as the activities. So:

- Transition RDS: when fired, consumes a token from DV and produces a token in RDS place. Then, after RDS is done, there's a transition that consumes from RDS and produces a token in DV again. But what activity is that? It's not part of the scenario, so maybe it's an implicit transition. However, in Petri nets, transitions need to be labeled. But the user's example code didn't have labels on transitions except for the execute_activity transition. The example used labels for transitions. So perhaps I should label the transitions with the activity names. So the transition that goes back from RDS to DV would have a label like "Return to DV" but that's not part of the scenario. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe the process after RDS is done, the token is returned to DV place, which is part of the same activity. So the RDS transition consumes from DV and produces in RDS. Then, another transition (maybe labeled as "Proceed to FC") consumes from RDS and produces in DV. But that's not part of the scenario. Alternatively, the RDS transition produces in DV again. Wait, that would be a direct arc from RDS to DV. But then, the transition would be RDS, which would have an arc from DV to RDS, and an arc from RDS to DV. But that would allow the token to loop between DV and RDS as needed.

But how to model that. Let's try:

- The transition RDS has an input place DV and an output place RDS. Then, there's a transition from RDS to DV. But what's the activity for that transition? The scenario doesn't mention it. So perhaps the transition from RDS to DV is not an activity but just a flow. However, in Petri nets, transitions are the events. So maybe the RDS transition is followed by a transition that allows the token to return to DV. But that's not an activity. This seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the RDS is a transition that, when fired, consumes from DV and produces in RDS, and then another transition (say, DV again) that consumes from RDS and produces in DV. But that would imply that the DV activity is fired again, which might not be accurate. Because after RDS, the documents are resubmitted, and then the DV activity is done again. So the transition for DV would be fired again. So the structure would be:

DV place  transition DV (activity)  DV place (no, that's not right). Wait, no. Let me think again. After RDS is done, the process returns to DV. So the DV activity is done again. So the transition for DV would have to be fired again. So the structure would be:

- After RDS is done (token in RDS place), there's a transition that leads back to DV place. But that transition would be the DV activity. So the transition DV would have an input place RDS and an output place DV. Wait, but that would allow the DV activity to be fired again. But that seems redundant. However, in the scenario, after RDS, the DV activity is done again. So the transition DV would have two input places: CR (initially) and RDS (after RDS). So the transition DV would have arcs from CR and RDS to DV place. But that might not be correct.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for standard ways to model such loops in Petri nets.

In Petri nets, a loop can be modeled by having a transition that consumes from a place and produces in the same place. But that would be a self-loop, which is not allowed unless there's a token. Alternatively, a loop can be modeled by having a transition that consumes from a place and produces in another place, which then has a transition back to the original place.

So for the DV and RDS loop:

- The DV transition consumes from DV place and produces in RDS place (but that's not correct). Wait, the DV activity is done once, then if documents are incomplete, RDS is done. So maybe:

- After the DV activity is done (i.e., the token is in the DV place), there's a choice to either proceed to FC or go to RDS. So the DV place has two transitions:

   a) Transition to RDS (activity RDS), which consumes from DV and produces in RDS place.

   b) Transition to FC (activity FC), which consumes from DV and produces in FC place.

Then, after RDS is done (token in RDS place), there's a transition back to DV (activity DV again?), which would consume from RDS and produce in DV place. So that allows the loop.

So the transitions would be:

- Transition RDS: input place DV, output place RDS.

- Transition DV (again? Or another transition?) from RDS to DV. But if the transition is labeled as DV, then firing it would mean the DV activity is done again. That might make sense, as after re-submission, the DV activity is done again.

So the structure would be:

DV place  RDS transition (input DV, output RDS)  RDS place  DV transition (input RDS, output DV)  DV place.

This allows the loop between DV and RDS.

Similarly, for the FC and II loop:

After FC is done (token in FC place), there's a choice to proceed to CA or go to II. So:

- Transition II (input FC, output II place).

- Transition to CA (input FC, output CA place).

Then, after II is done (token in II place), there's a transition back to FC (activity FC again?), which consumes from II and produces in FC.

So the same pattern applies for FC and II.

Now, for the Approval step: after CA, if the amount is above threshold, AP is needed. So the CA place has two transitions:

- Transition AP (input CA, output AP place).

- Transition to P (input CA, output P place).

But the scenario says that the approval is needed only if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So this is a choice point. So the CA place has two transitions: one to AP (if needed) and one to P (if not needed). Then, after AP, the token goes to P place.

So the transitions would be:

- Transition AP: from CA to AP place.

- Transition to P: from CA to P place.

Then, after AP is done (token in AP place), it goes to P place.

Then, after P, the process goes to N (Notification), then to CL (Closure).

So the places would be:

C, CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Transitions:

CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Now, let's outline all the transitions and arcs.

Initial marking: token in C.

Final marking: token in CL.

Now, let's build the Petri net step by step.

1. Create the net and places.

Places:

- C
- CR
- DV
- RDS
- FC
- II
- CA
- AP
- P
- N
- CL

Transitions:

- CR (Claim Registration)
- DV (Document Verification)
- RDS (Re-Document Submission)
- FC (Fraud Check)
- II (In-depth Investigation)
- CA (Claim Assessment)
- AP (Approval)
- P (Payment)
- N (Notification)
- CL (Closure)

Now, the arcs:

Start with C  CR transition.

- Arc from C to CR (transition CR).

Then, CR  DV transition.

- Arc from CR to DV (transition DV).

DV has two outgoing transitions: one to RDS (if documents incomplete) and one to FC (if complete).

- Arc from DV to RDS (transition RDS).
- Arc from DV to FC (transition FC).

RDS has an arc back to DV (transition DV again).

- Arc from RDS to DV (transition DV).

FC has two outgoing transitions: one to II (if fraud check raises doubts) and one to CA (if no doubts).

- Arc from FC to II (transition II).
- Arc from FC to CA (transition CA).

II has an arc back to FC (transition FC again).

- Arc from II to FC (transition FC).

CA has two outgoing transitions: one to AP (if approval needed) and one to P (if not needed).

- Arc from CA to AP (transition AP).
- Arc from CA to P (transition P).

AP  P transition.

- Arc from AP to P (transition P).

P  N transition.

- Arc from P to N (transition N).

N  CL transition.

- Arc from N to CL (transition CL).

Now, let's check if all steps are covered.

After RDS, the token returns to DV (so the DV transition can be fired again if needed).

After II, the token returns to FC (so FC can be fired again if needed).

AP is fired only if needed, then leads to P.

Once P is done, N is done, then CL.

Now, the initial marking is {C: 1}, and the final marking is {CL: 1}.

But wait, in the example given in the prompt, the final marking is {sink: 1} and then they remove the sink place. So in this case, the final place is CL. So the initial marking is {C:1}, final marking is {CL:1}.

Now, let's code this.

First, create the PetriNet with the places and transitions.

But in Python, using pm4py's PetriNet class, we need to add places and transitions.

Let me outline the code.

Import necessary modules:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

Create the net:

net = PetriNet(name="InsuranceClaimProcess")

Create all the places:

places = {
    'C': PetriNet.Place(name="C"),
    'CR': PetriNet.Place(name="CR"),
    'DV': PetriNet.Place(name="DV"),
    'RDS': PetriNet.Place(name="RDS"),
    'FC': PetriNet.Place(name="FC"),
    'II': PetriNet.Place(name="II"),
    'CA': PetriNet.Place(name="CA"),
    'AP': PetriNet.Place(name="AP"),
    'P': PetriNet.Place(name="P"),
    'N': PetriNet.Place(name="N"),
    'CL': PetriNet.Place(name="CL"),
}

Then add all places to the net:

for place in places.values():
    net.places.add(place)

Create the transitions:

transitions = {
    'CR': PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration"),
    'DV': PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification"),
    'RDS': PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"),
    'FC': PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check"),
    'II': PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation"),
    'CA': PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment"),
    'AP': PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval"),
    'P': PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment"),
    'N': PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification"),
    'CL': PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure"),
}

Add transitions to the net:

for trans in transitions.values():
    net.transitions.add(trans)

Now, add arcs.

For each transition, add input and output arcs.

Let's go step by step.

1. C  CR transition:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['C'], transitions['CR'], net)

2. CR  DV:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CR'], transitions['DV'], net)

3. DV  RDS:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['DV'], transitions['RDS'], net)

4. DV  FC:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['DV'], transitions['FC'], net)

5. RDS  DV:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['RDS'], transitions['DV'], net)

6. FC  II:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['FC'], transitions['II'], net)

7. FC  CA:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['FC'], transitions['CA'], net)

8. II  FC:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['II'], transitions['FC'], net)

9. CA  AP:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CA'], transitions['AP'], net)

10. CA  P:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CA'], transitions['P'], net)

11. AP  P:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['AP'], transitions['P'], net)

12. P  N:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['P'], transitions['N'], net)

13. N  CL:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['N'], transitions['CL'], net)

Wait, but the transitions are the activities, so for example, the transition 'DV' is the Document Verification activity. So when the transition is fired, it consumes a token from its input place and produces in its output place.

But in the code above, the arcs are added from the input place to the transition, and then from the transition to the output place. Wait, no. The add_arc_from_to function adds an arc from the source (a place or transition) to the target (a transition or place). So for example, adding an arc from place C to transition CR (so that when CR is fired, it consumes a token from C). Then, adding an arc from transition CR to place CR (so that when CR is fired, it produces a token in CR place).

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The function petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, target, net) adds an arc from source to target. In Petri nets, arcs can be from place to transition (input arc), or from transition to place (output arc). So for example, the transition CR has an input arc from place C and an output arc to place CR.

So in code, for transition CR:

- Add an arc from place C to transition CR (input arc).
- Add an arc from transition CR to place CR (output arc).

But in the code above, I only added the first part. Oh, right! I forgot to add the output arcs. So each transition must have both input and output arcs.

So the previous code was incomplete. For each transition, we need to add both input and output arcs.

So for example, for transition CR:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['C'], transitions['CR'], net)  # input arc from C to CR
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['CR'], places['CR'], net)  # output arc from CR to CR place

Similarly for other transitions.

So let's correct the code.

Let me rework the steps.

For each transition, we need to:

- Add an input arc from the source place to the transition.
- Add an output arc from the transition to the target place.

So for the first step:

1. C  CR transition:

- Input arc from C to CR.
- Output arc from CR to CR place.

So:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['C'], transitions['CR'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['CR'], places['CR'], net)

Similarly for all other transitions.

So let's redo all the steps with that in mind.

Let's go step by step.

1. Transition CR: from C to CR place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['C'], transitions['CR'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['CR'], places['CR'], net)

2. Transition DV: from CR to DV place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CR'], transitions['DV'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['DV'], places['DV'], net)

3. Transition RDS: from DV to RDS place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['DV'], transitions['RDS'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['RDS'], places['RDS'], net)

4. Transition FC: from DV to FC place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['DV'], transitions['FC'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['FC'], places['FC'], net)

Wait, but the DV place has two transitions: RDS and FC. So the DV place has two outgoing arcs to RDS and FC transitions. So the code above for steps 3 and 4 adds those.

Then, the RDS transition has an output to DV place:

5. Transition DV (from RDS to DV place).

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['RDS'], transitions['DV'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['DV'], places['DV'], net)

Wait, but this would mean that the transition DV has two input arcs: one from CR and one from RDS. And two output arcs: one to DV (from step 2) and another from step 5. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The transition DV has:

- Input arcs from CR and RDS (places).

- Output arc to DV place (from step 2 and 5? No, step 2 is from CR to DV transition, and step 5 is from RDS to DV transition. But the output of the DV transition is to DV place? No, the output of the DV transition is to the DV place? No, the transition DV's output is to the DV place? No, the transition DV's output is to the DV place? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The transition DV is the Document Verification activity. So when it is fired, it consumes a token from its input place (which could be CR or RDS) and produces a token in the DV place. Wait, no. The transition DV's output should be to the DV place? That would be a loop. But that's not correct. Because the DV transition is supposed to move the token from the input place (CR or RDS) to the DV place. So the transition DV has input arcs from CR and RDS, and output arc to DV place.

Wait, no. The transition DV is the activity of Document Verification. So the input is the previous place (CR or RDS), and the output is the DV place. So the transition DV has:

- Input arc from CR to DV transition.

- Input arc from RDS to DV transition.

- Output arc from DV transition to DV place.

Wait, but that would mean that the DV transition is connected to the DV place. That would be a loop where firing the DV transition would consume a token from its input and produce in the DV place.

But in the initial steps, the DV transition is fired from CR, moving the token from CR to DV place. Then, when the DV transition is fired again from RDS, it moves the token from RDS to DV place. So the DV transition has two input places (CR and RDS) and one output place (DV).

But in the code above, for step 2, we added an arc from CR to DV transition (input), and an arc from DV transition to DV place (output). Then, for step 5, we added an arc from RDS to DV transition (input), and an arc from DV transition to DV place (output). But that would mean that the output arc is added twice, but in Petri nets, multiple arcs between the same source and target are allowed. Or perhaps the code should add the output arc once.

Wait, no. The output arc from the transition DV to the DV place is added once. For example, in step 2, after adding the input arc from CR to DV transition, we add the output arc from DV transition to DV place. Then, in step 5, we add an input arc from RDS to DV transition, but the output arc is already added. So the code would have:

For step 2:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CR'], transitions['DV'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['DV'], places['DV'], net)

For step 5:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['RDS'], transitions['DV'], net)
# No need to add the output arc again, since it's already added.

Ah, right. So the code for step 5 would only add the input arc from RDS to DV transition. The output arc is already added in step 2.

So that's correct.

So for the DV transition, the input arcs are from CR and RDS, and the output arc is to DV place.

This allows the transition DV to be fired when there's a token in CR or RDS, and produces a token in DV place.

Then, the DV place has an arc to RDS transition (input arc from DV place to RDS transition), which would be step 3.

Wait, step 3 is for the RDS transition. Let me check:

3. Transition RDS: from DV to RDS place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['DV'], transitions['RDS'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['RDS'], places['RDS'], net)

So this adds an input arc from DV place to RDS transition, and an output arc from RDS transition to RDS place.

So when RDS transition is fired, it consumes a token from DV place and produces a token in RDS place.

Then, the RDS place has an arc to DV transition (input arc from RDS place to DV transition), which is step 5.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['RDS'], transitions['DV'], net)
# Output arc already added earlier.

So that allows the DV transition to be fired again from RDS place.

So this creates the loop between DV and RDS.

Similarly for FC and II.

Proceeding with this approach.

Now, let's continue with the other transitions.

6. Transition II: from FC to II place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['FC'], transitions['II'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['II'], places['II'], net)

7. Transition CA: from FC to CA place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['FC'], transitions['CA'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['CA'], places['CA'], net)

8. Transition FC: from II to FC place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['II'], transitions['FC'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['FC'], places['FC'], net)

Wait, this would mean that the FC transition has input arcs from FC place (original) and II place. And output arc to FC place. Wait, no. Let me think:

The FC transition is the Fraud Check activity. Initially, it is fired from the DV place (as per step 4). Then, after II is done, the FC transition is fired again from II place. So the FC transition has input arcs from DV (step 4) and II (step 8), and output arc to FC place.

But in step 4, the FC transition is added with an input arc from DV to FC transition and output to FC place. Then, in step 8, we add an input arc from II to FC transition. So the FC transition has two input arcs: from DV and II, and one output arc to FC place.

So when the FC transition is fired, it consumes from its input (either DV or II) and produces a token in FC place.

Then, the FC place has two outgoing transitions: II and CA.

So that's correct.

Next steps:

9. Transition AP: from CA to AP place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CA'], transitions['AP'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['AP'], places['AP'], net)

10. Transition P: from CA to P place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CA'], transitions['P'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['P'], places['P'], net)

11. Transition P: from AP to P place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['AP'], transitions['P'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['P'], places['P'], net)

Wait, but the transition P is already added. So in step 10, we added the transition P from CA to P place. Then, in step 11, we add an input arc from AP to P transition, and output to P place.

So the P transition has input arcs from CA and AP, and output to P place.

Then, step 12:

12. Transition N: from P to N place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['P'], transitions['N'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['N'], places['N'], net)

13. Transition CL: from N to CL place.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['N'], transitions['CL'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['CL'], places['CL'], net)

Now, the initial marking is {C: 1}, and the final marking is {CL: 1}.

But wait, the final marking is when the token is in CL place. So fm = Marking() and fm[CL] = 1.

Now, the code for the initial and final markings:

im = Marking()
im[places['C']] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[places['CL']] = 1

But in the example provided, they remove the sink place and adjust the final marking. However, in this case, the final place is CL, so no need to remove it.

So the code would be:

Then, the code would be:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="InsuranceClaimProcess")

places = {
    'C': PetriNet.Place(name="C"),
    'CR': PetriNet.Place(name="CR"),
    'DV': PetriNet.Place(name="DV"),
    'RDS': PetriNet.Place(name="RDS"),
    'FC': PetriNet.Place(name="FC"),
    'II': PetriNet.Place(name="II"),
    'CA': PetriNet.Place(name="CA"),
    'AP': PetriNet.Place(name="AP"),
    'P': PetriNet.Place(name="P"),
    'N': PetriNet.Place(name="N"),
    'CL': PetriNet.Place(name="CL"),
}

for place in places.values():
    net.places.add(place)

transitions = {
    'CR': PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration"),
    'DV': PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification"),
    'RDS': PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"),
    'FC': PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check"),
    'II': PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation"),
    'CA': PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment"),
    'AP': PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval"),
    'P': PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment"),
    'N': PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification"),
    'CL': PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure"),
}

for trans in transitions.values():
    net.transitions.add(trans)

# Adding arcs
# CR
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['C'], transitions['CR'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['CR'], places['CR'], net)

# DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CR'], transitions['DV'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['DV'], places['DV'], net)

# RDS
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['DV'], transitions['RDS'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['RDS'], places['RDS'], net)

# FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['DV'], transitions['FC'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['FC'], places['FC'], net)

# RDS to DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['RDS'], transitions['DV'], net)

# II
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['FC'], transitions['II'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['II'], places['II'], net)

# CA
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['FC'], transitions['CA'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['CA'], places['CA'], net)

# II to FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['II'], transitions['FC'], net)

# AP
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CA'], transitions['AP'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['AP'], places['AP'], net)

# P
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CA'], transitions['P'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['P'], places['P'], net)

# AP to P
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['AP'], transitions['P'], net)

# N
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['P'], transitions['N'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['N'], places['N'], net)

# CL
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['N'], transitions['CL'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['CL'], places['CL'], net)

im = Marking()
im[places['C']] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[places['CL']] = 1

Wait, but in the code above, for the transition P, the code adds:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CA'], transitions['P'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['P'], places['P'], net)

Then, petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['AP'], transitions['P'], net) is added, but no output arc for that. Wait, no. The code for AP to P:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['AP'], transitions['P'], net)
# Then, we need to add the output arc from P to P place?

Wait, no. The transition P has input arcs from CA and AP, and output arc to P place. So in step 10, when adding the transition P from CA to P, we added:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['CA'], transitions['P'], net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions['P'], places['P'], net)

Then, for the AP to P transition:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places['AP'], transitions['P'], net)
# We need to add the output arc again? No, because the output arc is already added. So the output arc from P to P place is already there. So the code is correct.

So the transition P has two input arcs (from CA and AP), and one output arc to P place.

So the code seems correct.

Now, I need to check if all transitions have their input and output arcs.

Let me check for each transition:

- CR: input from C, output to CR. Correct.

- DV: input from CR and RDS, output to DV. Correct.

- RDS: input from DV, output to RDS. Correct.

- FC: input from DV and II, output to FC. Correct.

- II: input from FC, output to II. Correct.

- CA: input from FC, output to CA. Correct.

- AP: input from CA, output to AP. Correct.

- P: input from CA and AP, output to P. Correct.

- N: input from P, output to N. Correct.

- CL: input from N, output to CL. Correct.

Yes, that seems to cover all.

Now, the initial marking is C:1, final marking is CL:1.

This should model the scenario correctly.

I think this should work. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

###  **Explanation of the Petri Net Structure**

- **Places**:
  - Represent states in the claim management process (e.g., `C`, `CR`, `DV`, `RDS`, etc.).
  - `C` is the **initial state** (new claim), and `CL` is the **final state** (closed claim).

- **Transitions**:
  - Represent activities (e.g., `CR` = Claim Registration, `DV` = Document Verification, etc.).
  - Each transition has **input arcs** from places and **output arcs** to places.

- **Loops**:
  - **DV  RDS  DV**: Models the possibility of re-submission of documents.
  - **FC  II  FC**: Models the possibility of re-checking for fraud via in-depth investigation.

- **Initial Marking**:
  - `im[places['C']] = 1`: A token is placed at the start of the process (a new claim arrives).

- **Final Marking**:
  - `fm[places['CL']] = 1`: The process ends when the claim is closed and archived.

---

###  **Verification of Correctness**

- The Petri net models all the steps in the insurance claim process.
- It includes **conditional branches** (e.g., DV  RDS or DV  FC) and **loops** (e.g., DV  RDS  DV).
- The **initial** and **final markings** are correctly defined to represent the start and end of the process.
