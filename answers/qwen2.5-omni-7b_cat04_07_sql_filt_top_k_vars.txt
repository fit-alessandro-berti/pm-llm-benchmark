        COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) AS case_count
    FROM

    GROUP BY

)
SELECT 
    ol.case_id,
    ol.activity,
    ol.timestamp
FROM 
    event_log ol
JOIN 
    variants v ON ol.case_id = v.case_id
WHERE 
    v.variant_sequence IN (
        SELECT 
            variant_sequence
        FROM 
            variant_counts
        ORDER BY 
            case_count DESC
        LIMIT 5 -- Adjust this limit based on the value of K
    );
```

This solution involves several steps:
1. **ordered_activities**: This CTE assigns a row number (`rn`) to each activity within its respective `case_id` based on the `timestamp`. This ensures that the activities are ordered correctly according to time.
2. **variants**: Here, we aggregate the ordered activities into sequences using `GROUP_CONCAT`, creating a string representation of each variant's sequence.
3. **variant_counts**: We then count how many distinct cases each variant sequence appears in.
4. Finally, we select events from the original log where the `case_id` corresponds to one of the top K variants, as determined by the `case_count` in descending order. The `LIMIT 5` at the end can be adjusted to specify the exact value of K.
