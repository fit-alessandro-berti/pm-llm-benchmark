Based on the provided data, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Declaration and Payment Process

**Actors:**
- Employee
- Administration
- Budget Owner
- Pre-Approver (role not specified)
- Supervisor
- Missing (unknown role or system issue)

**States/Statuses:**
- SUBMITTED
- APPROVED
- FINAL_APPROVED
- REJECTED
- FOR_APPROVAL

**Flow:**

1. **Employee Actions:**
   - Submits a declaration.
   - Can save a declaration (though this is less frequent).
   - Can reject their own declaration if it's SUBMITTED or APPROVED by others.

2. **Administration Actions:**
   - Approves or rejects declarations submitted by employees.
   - If approved, the declaration moves to the next approval level (Budget Owner or Supervisor) or is marked as FINAL_APPROVED.
   - If rejected, it goes back to the employee for resubmission or is marked as REJECTED.

3. **Budget Owner Actions:**
   - Approves or rejects declarations approved by Administration.
   - If approved, the declaration moves to the final approval level (Supervisor) or is marked as FINAL_APPROVED.
   - If rejected, it goes back to the employee for resubmission or is marked as REJECTED.

4. **Pre-Approver Actions:**
   - Approves or rejects declarations submitted by employees.
   - If approved, the declaration moves to the final approval level (Supervisor) or is marked as FINAL_APPROVED.
   - If rejected, it goes back to the employee for resubmission or is marked as REJECTED.

5. **Supervisor Actions:**
   - Approves or rejects declarations approved by others (Administration, Budget Owner, or Pre-Approver).
   - If approved, marks the declaration as FINAL_APPROVED.
   - If rejected, it goes back to the employee for resubmission or is marked as REJECTED.

6. **Missing Actions:**
   - An unknown role or system issue that can reject declarations at various stages, sending them back to the employee for resubmission.

7. **Payment Stage:**
   - After a declaration is marked as FINAL_APPROVED by the Supervisor, a payment request is made.
   - The payment is then handled (presumably approved and processed).

**Frequent Paths:**

- Employee submits -> Admin approves -> Budget Owner approves -> Supervisor final approves -> Payment requested (most frequent)
- Employee submits -> Admin approves -> Supervisor final approves -> Payment requested
- Employee submits -> Admin rejects -> Employee resubmits

**Less Frequent Paths:**

- Various rejection paths at different stages, sending declarations back to the employee for resubmission.
- Some approval paths involving Pre-Approver or direct final approval by Supervisor.

**Performance Metrics:**
- Frequency: The number of times a specific transition occurred in the process.
- Performance: An unknown metric associated with each transition. It could represent time taken, cost incurred, or another relevant measure for that step in the process.
