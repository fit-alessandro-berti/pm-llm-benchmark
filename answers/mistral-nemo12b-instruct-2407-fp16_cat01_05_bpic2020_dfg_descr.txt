Based on the provided data, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Declaration and Payment Workflow

**Actors Involved:**
1. Employee
2. Administration (Admin)
3. Budget Owner (BO)
4. Pre-Approver (PA)
5. Supervisor

**States/Statuses:**
1. SUBMITTED
2. APPROVED
   - By Admin, PA, BO, or Supervisor
3. REJECTED
   - By Employee, Admin, BO, PA, or Supervisor, or due to MISSING information
4. FOR_APPROVAL (transitional state)
5. FINAL_APPROVED
6. Payment Handled

**Workflow:**

1. **Employee Actions:**
   - Starts by SUBMITTING a declaration.
   - Can REJECT their own declaration.
   - Can SAVE a declaration without submitting it.

2. **Admin Actions:**
   - Reviews and APPROVES or REJECTS the employee's declaration.
   - If approved, it can be further routed to BO, PA, or directly to Supervisor for final approval.
   - If rejected by Admin, it goes back to the Employee for resubmission.

3. **Budget Owner (BO) Actions:**
   - Reviews and APPROVES or REJECTS declarations sent from Admin.
   - If approved, sends it to Supervisor for final approval.
   - If rejected, it goes back to Employee via Admin.

4. **Pre-Approver (PA) Actions:**
   - Reviews and APPROVES or REJECTS declarations sent by Admin.
   - If approved, sends it to Supervisor for final approval.
   - If rejected, it goes back to Employee via Admin.

5. **Supervisor Actions:**
   - Reviews and either FINAL_APPROVES or REJECTS the declaration.
   - If approved, triggers a 'Request Payment' action.
   - If rejected, it can go back to Employee for resubmission.

**Payment Process:**
- Upon final approval by Supervisor, a 'Request Payment' is triggered.
- The payment process ends with 'Payment Handled'.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are some exceptional/transitional flows not typically seen in a standard approval workflow (e.g., going from one status directly to another without passing through a specific actor).
- Some steps have very low frequencies, which might indicate rare or error cases (e.g., 'FOR_APPROVAL' states).
