Here is a clear, end-to-end interpretation of the pseudo-BPMN you provided, explaining the purpose of each activity, the gateway logic, how paths converge or loop, and how the process differs for standard versus custom requests.

High-level storyline
- The process handles an incoming customer request.
- It first determines whether the request is standard or custom.
- Standard requests go through validation and parallel operational checks; custom requests go through feasibility and quoting.
- Both paths reconverge to determine if managerial approval is required.
- If approval is required and granted, the process proceeds to invoice; if not granted, the request is reworked and re-submitted to approval.
- The process ends by informing the customer (or earlier with a rejection for infeasible custom work).

Step-by-step explanation
1) Start Event
- Trigger: A customer request is received (order, inquiry, or RFQ).

2) Task A: Receive Customer Request
- Purpose: Capture the request and necessary data (customer info, items/specs, quantities, dates, custom requirements).
- Output: A logged request with sufficient detail to classify it.

3) Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type
- Meaning: An exclusive choice; exactly one path is taken.
- Logic: Classifies the request as Standard or Custom based on rules (e.g., off-the-shelf items with known pricing/lead times vs. bespoke specifications).

Standard path
4) Task B1: Perform Standard Validation
- Purpose: Verify completeness and correctness for standard orders (SKUs exist, quantity valid, address/payment terms present, pricing applicable).
- Output: A validated request plus any flags that may matter later (e.g., rush delivery, edge-case pricing).

5) Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks
- Meaning: A parallel split; both outgoing paths start simultaneously.

6) Task C1: Credit Check
- Purpose: Assess the customer’s credit status and terms eligibility.
- Output: Credit status/limits that may affect approval requirements or payment terms.

7) Task C2: Inventory Check
- Purpose: Confirm on-hand stock or plan for allocation.
- Output: Availability status by item and date, which affects fulfillment and delivery.

8) All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)
- Meaning: A parallel join; the flow waits until both C1 and C2 are finished.
- Output: Consolidated results from credit and inventory.

9) Task D: Calculate Delivery Date
- Purpose: Compute a realistic delivery date based on inventory, production capacity, lead times, and shipping.
- Output: A proposed delivery date or schedule. This becomes the basis for the pricing/offer and, later, the invoice.

Custom path
10) Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis
- Purpose: Determine if the requested customization can be done technically and economically (engineering/design effort, materials, compliance, capacity, timeline, cost).
- Output: A feasibility assessment plus preliminary cost/schedule data.

11) Gateway (XOR): Is Customization Feasible?
- Meaning: Exclusive choice based on feasibility outcome.
- If Yes: Proceed to quoting.
- If No: Reject.

12) Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation
- Purpose: Build a detailed quote for the custom work (scope, specifications, price, lead time, assumptions, change policy).
- Output: A formal custom quotation and supporting documentation.

13) Task E2: Send Rejection Notice
- Purpose: Inform the customer that the customization is not feasible; optionally propose alternatives.
- End Event: The process ends for this request when customization is infeasible.

Paths converge to approval decision
14) After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed
- Implicit XOR merge: The flow merges back into a single path regardless of whether it came from Task D (standard) or Task E1 (custom). Only one token arrives at a time.

15) Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Needed?
- Meaning: Exclusive choice; either approval is required or not.
- Typical rules that trigger approval (examples, to be defined by policy):
  - Price or discount exceeds threshold.
  - Margin below minimum target.
  - Lead time outside standard SLA or requires expediting.
  - Credit check raises risk flags or requires non-standard terms (e.g., prepayment).
  - High order value, unusual contract terms, or significant customization risks.
- If No: Proceed directly to invoice generation.
- If Yes: Seek manager approval.

16) Task F: Obtain Manager Approval
- Purpose: Obtain formal sign-off from the appropriate authority (sales manager, operations, finance).
- Output: Approval decision with any conditions.

17) Gateway (XOR): Is Approval Granted?
- Meaning: Exclusive choice:
  - If Yes: Proceed to invoice generation.
  - If No: Rework is required.

18) Task H: Re-evaluate Conditions (Rework)
- Purpose: Address reasons for rejection by adjusting terms or plan.
- For Standard requests: Loop back to Task D (recalculate delivery date, adjust quantities, shipping method, or pricing assumptions).
- For Custom requests: Loop back to Task E1 (revise scope, design trade-offs, cost assumptions, or schedule).
- This may iterate until approval is granted or the customer declines (the latter outcome is not shown as a separate end event in your model but can be handled by exiting the process or sending a withdrawal notice).

Finalize and close
19) Task G: Generate Final Invoice
- Purpose: Create the invoice using the approved terms.
- For Standard: Use standard pricing and the computed delivery date; apply credit terms from credit check.
- For Custom: Reflect the custom quotation’s scope, price, and timeline; include deposits or milestone billing if applicable.

20) Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer
- Purpose: Send the invoice and confirmation details (items, delivery/production schedule, terms, next steps).
- Output: Customer is informed; the handoff to fulfillment or production can proceed.

21) End Event
- The process concludes successfully.

Gateway semantics in this process
- XOR (exclusive) gateways:
  - Check Request Type: chooses Standard or Custom.
  - Is Customization Feasible?: chooses Yes or No.
  - Is Approval Needed?: chooses Yes or No.
  - Is Approval Granted?: chooses Yes or No.
  - XOR merge after the Standard/Custom branch: allows either path to continue, but only one at a time.
- AND (parallel) gateway:
  - Run Parallel Checks: launches Credit Check and Inventory Check simultaneously.
  - The parallel join waits for both C1 and C2 to complete before moving to Task D.

How Standard vs. Custom requests differ
- Standard:
  - Emphasis on operational validity and availability.
  - Uses parallel Credit and Inventory checks.
  - Computes a delivery date (Task D) and proceeds to approval decision.
  - Rework, if needed, focuses on delivery, allocations, or standard terms.
- Custom:
  - Emphasis on technical and commercial feasibility.
  - Has a feasibility decision with a potential early rejection.
  - Produces a bespoke quotation (Task E1).
  - Rework, if needed, focuses on scope/design/cost/time trade-offs.

When approvals and rework are triggered
- Approval is typically needed when the deal deviates from standard policy (pricing, margin, terms, risk, lead time, or scope).
- If approval is denied, rework is triggered:
  - Standard requests loop to Task D to adjust date/terms.
  - Custom requests loop to Task E1 to revise the quotation.
  - The loop continues until approval is secured or the opportunity is closed (not explicitly modeled but usually handled by a separate termination or rejection step).

Convergence and loops summary
- Convergences:
  - AND join after C1 and C2: synchronizes parallel checks.
  - XOR merge from Standard/Custom into approval decision.
  - After approval is granted (or when it isn’t needed), both paths converge at invoice generation.
- Loops:
  - From “Is Approval Granted?” = No, Task H leads back to D (Standard) or E1 (Custom) for rework, then returns to the approval decision again.

This explanation aligns with your pseudo-BPMN and clarifies the intent, decision logic, and flow behavior across standard and custom scenarios.
