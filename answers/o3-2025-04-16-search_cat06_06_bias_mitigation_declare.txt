Why these additions reduce bias

1. Response constraints  
   • “CheckApplicant Race/Gender/Age    BiasMitigationCheck” ensures that whenever a sensitive attribute is consulted, a dedicated bias-mitigation step must eventually occur. This forces the process to acknowledge and actively handle potential discrimination before moving on to a decision.

2. Precedence on Reject  
   • “BiasMitigationCheck precedes Reject” forbids any rejection unless bias mitigation has already been carried out in the same case, closing the loophole where a check is logged but never actually performed before the decision.

3. Non-chain succession blocks snap judgements  
   • By prohibiting the direct succession “CheckSensitiveAttribute    Reject”, the model removes the possibility of a knee-jerk negative outcome immediately after seeing the attribute. At least one other event must intervene (often the BiasMitigationCheck).

4. Responded-existence with ManualReview for minority outcomes  
   • Requiring a ManualReview to coexist with every “Approve_Minority” or “Reject_Minority” decision adds a human oversight layer whenever the applicant is from a minority group, helping to catch remaining inadvertent biases or data issues.

Together, these constraints embed explicit fairness checkpoints and human reviews into the loan-application workflow, making biased paths either impossible (blocked) or mandatory to pass through a mitigation step before any final decision is reached.
