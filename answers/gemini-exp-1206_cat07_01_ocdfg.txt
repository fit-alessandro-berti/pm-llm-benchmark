This visualization is a flowchart depicting the process of order fulfillment, from vendor invoice to closing the order. It includes four main starting points: VendorInvoiceItem, ReturnOrderItem, PurchaseRequisitionItem, and SalesOrderItem, each with a specified number of objects.

The flowchart uses color-coded lines to represent different paths or types of processes:

*   **Green:** Processes related to VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M objects)
*   **Red:** Processes related to ReturnOrderItem (0.8M objects)
*   **Purple:** Processes related to PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M objects)
*   **Blue:** Processes related to SalesOrderItem (3.5M objects)
*   **Orange:** Processes related to PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M objects)

Each path begins with a "Start" node and progresses through various steps, such as "Create Requisition," "Approve Requisition," "Create Order," "Pack Goods," "Ship Goods," "Confirm Delivery," "Process Return," "Check Stock," "Send Order," "Approve Payment," and "Create Invoice." Each step is represented by a rounded rectangle with the step name and the overall number of objects involved.

The lines connecting the steps indicate the flow of the process and are labeled with the time it takes to transition from one step to the next (e.g., 300ms, 400ms, 600ms).

The chart also features colored dots next to each step, likely representing different aspects or sub-processes within each step. The colors of the dots may correspond to the paths mentioned above.

Finally, each path concludes with an "End" node, indicating the completion of the respective process.
