Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects can bring significant benefits, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. Here are the main advantages and challenges:

**Benefits:**

1. **Scalability**: Decomposition strategies allow you to handle large datasets by breaking them down into smaller, manageable chunks. This is crucial for process mining at scale.

2. **Improved Performance**: Smaller datasets can be processed faster and with less memory, leading to improved performance of the process mining algorithms.

3. **Better Visualization**: Large processes can become complex and hard to visualize. Decomposition helps create a clearer overview by breaking down the process into smaller subprocesses.

4. **Enhanced Analyzability**: Smaller subprocesses are easier to analyze and understand. This can lead to more targeted improvements in the process.

5. **Parallel Processing**: Many decomposition strategies allow for parallel processing, which can significantly speed up the analysis of large datasets.

6. **Handling Complexity**: Decomposition helps manage the complexity of large processes by breaking them down into simpler subprocesses.

**Challenges:**

1. **Data Consistency**: When decomposing data, it's crucial to ensure that each subprocess is consistent and contains all necessary information for accurate process mining. This can be challenging when dealing with large, complex datasets.

2. **Boundary Selection**: Deciding where to split the process into subprocesses can be difficult. Poor boundary selection may lead to inaccurate results or loss of important information.

3. **Data Redundancy**: Decomposition strategies may result in redundant data if not handled properly. This can lead to increased storage requirements and slower processing times.

4. **Reassembly Challenges**: After analyzing each subprocess, reassembling the results into a coherent whole can be challenging. This is especially true when subprocesses interact with each other in complex ways.

5. **Loss of Global Perspective**: Focusing on individual subprocesses may lead to a loss of the global perspective of the overall process. This could result in missing important insights or overlooking systemic issues.

6. **Technical Complexity**: Implementing decomposition strategies can be technically challenging, requiring advanced knowledge of data mining techniques and programming skills.

7. **Validation Challenges**: Validating results obtained from decomposed datasets can be difficult due to the lack of ground truth for each subprocess.

In conclusion, while decomposition strategies offer significant benefits for large-scale process mining projects, they also present unique challenges that need to be carefully managed.
