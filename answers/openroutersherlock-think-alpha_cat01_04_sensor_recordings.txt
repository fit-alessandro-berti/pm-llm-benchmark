### Labeled Activities from Event Log Analysis

After analyzing the sensor patterns across the 15 events, I identified **5 distinct phases** based on clusters of similar readings and transitions. These phases show clear shifts in sensor values (e.g., sudden spikes in temperature/vibration for high-energy operations, steady low values for idle/inspection). I grouped consecutive events with consistent patterns, considering typical manufacturing signatures:

- **High vibration + rising temperature + material flow + advancing tool position**  Friction-based machining (e.g., cutting).
- **Elevated pressure + stable moderate values**  Mechanical joining (e.g., assembling).
- **Extreme temperature/vibration spikes + high energy + no flow**  Heat-intensive fusion (e.g., welding).
- **Low/stable values post-activity + minor position change**  Verification step (e.g., inspection).
- **Near-zero activity**  Idle/standby.

#### 1. **Idle/Standby** (Events 1-3, 13-15)
   - **Events**: 1 (08:00:00), 2 (08:00:05), 3 (08:00:10), 13 (08:01:00), 14 (08:01:05), 15 (08:01:10).
   - **Key Patterns**: Temperature ~20-21°C (ambient), Pressure=1 bar (baseline), Vibration=0 Hz, Material Flow=0 units/s, Tool Position=0 mm (retracted/reset), Energy ~0.40-0.50 kWh (minimal/idling power).
   - **Rationale**: All sensors at minimum/baseline levels indicate machine readiness or pause between cycles. Tool position resets to 0 at the end, signaling cycle completion. Repeated at start and end, bookending the process.

#### 2. **Cutting Metal** (Events 4-6)
   - **Events**: 4 (08:00:15), 5 (08:00:20), 6 (08:00:25).
   - **Key Patterns**: Temperature rising (505558°C), Pressure slight rise (11.5 bar), Vibration high & rising (303538 Hz), Material Flow steady at 5 units/s, Tool Position advancing (5710 mm), Energy increasing (2.003.00 kWh).
   - **Rationale**: Sharp onset of vibration and temperature from friction/heat generation, combined with consistent material feed (flow=5) and progressive tool advancement, is characteristic of cutting/milling operations where a tool shears material. Energy ramps with workload.

#### 3. **Assembling Parts** (Events 7-8)
   - **Events**: 7 (08:00:30), 8 (08:00:35).
   - **Key Patterns**: Temperature stable at 40°C (residual heat), Pressure elevated at 2 bar, Vibration low/moderate (10 Hz), Material Flow reduced to 2 units/s, Tool Position steady at 15 mm, Energy stable at 2.00 kWh.
   - **Rationale**: Post-cutting transition with increased pressure (suggesting clamping/pressing parts together) and reduced flow (slower part feed), but low vibration and steady position/tool usage indicate non-frictional assembly (e.g., bolting or inserting components). Temperature holds from prior heat without spiking.

#### 4. **Welding** (Event 9)
   - **Event**: 9 (08:00:40).
   - **Key Patterns**: Temperature spike to 80°C, Pressure=2 bar (holdover), Vibration peak at 50 Hz, Material Flow=0 units/s, Tool Position steady at 15 mm, Energy peak at 5.00 kWh.
   - **Rationale**: Extreme temperature and vibration surge with maximal energy draw and zero flow (no material movement during fusion) points to welding (e.g., arc/MIG), where electrical arc generates intense localized heat and oscillatory vibrations. Steady position suggests fixed workpiece.

#### 5. **Quality Inspection** (Events 10-12)
   - **Events**: 10 (08:00:45), 11 (08:00:50), 12 (08:00:55).
   - **Key Patterns**: Temperature cooling (803025°C), Pressure drop to 1 bar, Vibration very low (15 Hz), Material Flow minimal (01 units/s), Tool Position advances slightly (1520 mm), Energy low (1.001.60 kWh).
   - **Rationale**: Rapid cooldown post-welding with minimal sensor activity (low vib/flow) and subtle tool movement (position to 20 mm, perhaps for scanning/probing) indicates a non-destructive check for defects/dimensions. Low energy confirms passive verification rather than active processing.

### Process Flow Summary
The sequence forms a logical manufacturing cycle on Machine M1: **Idle  Cutting Metal  Assembling Parts  Welding  Quality Inspection  Idle**. Transitions are smooth (e.g., tool position persists/advances across phases), with energy/temperature as leading indicators of activity intensity. This derives a high-level process model from raw data via pattern clustering.
