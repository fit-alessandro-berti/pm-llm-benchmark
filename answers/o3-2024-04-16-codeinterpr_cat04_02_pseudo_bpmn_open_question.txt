Below is one possible re-design of the flow, written from a practitioner’s perspective.  It keeps the logical intent of the original model but adds three levers for improvement:  

• Automation/RPA where the work is deterministic.  
• Dynamic work orchestration driven by a resource pool and real-time SLA data.  
• A predictive-analytics “brain” that anticipates whether a request will become a custom case and whether managerial approval is likely to be refused, so that the model can front-load or even bypass steps.


1. High-level “To-Be” skeleton (textual BPMN)  

Start  
 Sub-Process SP0 “Pre-Classification & Prediction” (ML model + rules)  
    – Predict(NeedsCustom?)  (confidence score)  
    – Predict(ApprovalRisk)  
 Event-Based XOR Gateway G0  
    – (High probability of custom)  Custom lane  
    – (Low probability of custom)   Standard lane  
    – (Borderline)                  “Hybrid Fast-Track” lane (do both light custom & std checks in parallel)  

All three lanes eventually merge into a new Parallel Gateway G1 that launches “robot-ready” validation sub-processes.

 SP1  “RPA: Standard Validation” (if still needed)  
 SP2  “RPA: Credit Check”  
 SP3  “API: Real-Time Inventory”  
(join at G2)  

 Task “Delivery or Lead-Time Optimiser” (algorithm uses inventory + production calendar)  

 Event-Sub-Process “Auto-Approval Service”  
    – If Predict(ApprovalRisk) < threshold & order value < X  skip human approval  

Otherwise:  
 Dynamic Work Allocation Gateway G3  
    – Route to first available manager with authority  required level  
    – SLA timer boundary to escalate after n minutes  

 XOR “Approve?”  
    – Yes  “Generate Final Doc Pack” (invoice + quotation in one service)  
    – No   “Collaborative Re-Quote Loop” (shared workspace with customer)  

 Task “Multi-Channel Confirmation” (email + portal + SMS)  
End

Below we drill into the effects on each original step, the new components, and the trade-offs.


2. Task-by-Task / Gateway Changes

Task A “Receive Customer Request”  
• Replace email intake with a customer self-service portal + API.  
• Attach a real-time validation webform to capture all metadata needed by ML model, reducing rework.

Gateway “Check Request Type”  
• Move to SP0 Pre-Classification.  Use ML classifier (trained on historical SKUs, free-text requirements, and past feasibility outcomes).  Output: probability as well as categorical label.  
• Borderline cases enter “Hybrid lane” that launches a reduced feasibility check while standard processing proceeds—whichever finishes first wins (“speculative execution”).

Task B1 / B2 Validations  
• Convert to unattended RPA bots (document ingest, rule checks, ERP look-ups).  
• Log every field to a data lake to keep the prediction model up to date (closed feedback loop).

Parallel Checks (C1, C2)  
• Keep parallelism but expose them as micro-services callable in parallel from any upstream process, not just standard orders.  
• Add compensation boundary events so that if either check fails, the other can be cancelled early.

Task D “Calculate Delivery Date”  
• Replace deterministic calendar lookup with optimisation algorithm: considers current WIP, overtime cost, customer segment.  
• Expose as REST service so that quotation, confirmation e-mails, and portal can call the same source of truth.

Custom Feasibility Path (E1/E2)  
• Move custom engineering drawings, cost spreadsheets, etc., into a shared digital workspace so that customers and engineers can collaborate asynchronously.  
• Add an event-based gateway that listens for “customer uploads new info” so the feasibility team is triggered immediately rather than on batch cycles.

Approval Section (F, G, H)  
• Introduce “Auto-Approval Service” that short-circuits low-risk cases.  
• Human approval tasks are put into a dynamic queue prioritised by SLA remaining time and skill tags; managers work off this queue via a mobile app.  
• If rejected, instead of looping blindly, trigger a structured “Re-Quote” sub-process with clear states (Needs Re-Costing, Awaiting Customer Response, etc.) so the loop becomes measurable.

Task I “Send Confirmation”  
• Consolidate outputs into a single omnichannel task executed by a communication micro-service; eliminates divergence across e-mail templates.


3. New Decision Gateways / Sub-Processes

• G0 Event-based gateway driven by ML scores: routes Standard vs Custom vs Hybrid.  
• Auto-Approval Service (event-sub-process) triggered by business rules + predictive risk score.  
• SLA Timer & Escalation Sub-Process attached to Manager Approval to avoid “silent” bottlenecks.  
• Post-Implementation Feedback Loop: nightly batch retrains the ML models; KPIs pushed to a dashboard.


4. Expected Impact

Turnaround Time  
• Early prediction + speculative execution removes the wait to “discover” custom needs (past data often shows 6–24 h lost here).  
• RPA removes manual swivel-chair work; typical 40-60 % saving on validation duration.  
• Dynamic queue with escalation reduces approval latency by >30 % according to pilot studies.

Flexibility and Customer Experience  
• Hybrid lane allows borderline cases to be handled without rigid categorisation—important for “mass customisation.”  
• Collaborative feasibility workspace gives customers transparency and reduces back-and-forth e-mails.  
• Omnichannel confirmation meets customers on their preferred channel and provides a single order reference.

Operational Complexity & Risk  
• Yes, micro-services and ML components add technical complexity and demand MLOps capability.  
• Compensation and event-sub-processes make exceptions explicit, which improves auditability.  
• Continuous learning loop means the system gets better over time but requires data-governance discipline.


5. Implementation Road-Map (condensed)

Phase 1: Stand-up RPA for standard validations; expose inventory & credit checks as APIs.  
Phase 2: Collect data; build and integrate predictive model for Custom/Approval.  
Phase 3: Introduce dynamic work allocation engine + mobile approval app.  
Phase 4: Full hybrid lane, optimisation algorithms, and continuous ML retraining.

By staging the rollout, the organisation realises quick wins on automation while gradually layering in analytics and advanced orchestration, achieving faster cycle times, higher first-time-right rates, and improved customer satisfaction without an uncontrolled spike in operational complexity.
