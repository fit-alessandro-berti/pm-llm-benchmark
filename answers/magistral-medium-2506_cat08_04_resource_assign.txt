# **Process Mining-Driven Resource Assignment Optimization for TechSolve Solutions**

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **Metrics for Performance Analysis**
To assess agent and tier performance, we would analyze the following metrics derived from the event log:

- **Workload Distribution:**
  - Number of tickets handled per agent/tier over time.
  - Average time spent per ticket (by tier, agent, and ticket type).
  - Distribution of ticket priorities (P1-P4) across tiers.

- **Efficiency & Effectiveness Metrics:**
  - **First-Call Resolution Rate (L1):** Percentage of tickets resolved without escalation.
  - **Escalation Rate:** Frequency of tickets escalated from L1  L2/L3, and L2  L3.
  - **Reassignment Frequency:** Count of ticket reassignments within/between tiers.
  - **Skill Match Ratio:** Percentage of tickets assigned to agents with the exact required skill.
  - **Processing Time per Tier:** Median/mean time spent per ticket by L1, L2, L3.

- **Skill Utilization Analysis:**
  - Frequency of skill usage across agents (e.g., how often "Networking-Firewall" is actually used by assigned agents).
  - Cases where high-skill agents (L2/L3) handle tasks that could be managed by L1 with proper training.
  - Overlap analysis: Are certain skills overrepresented in the team while others are scarce?

### **Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Patterns**
Key techniques to uncover actual vs. intended assignment logic:

1. **Social Network Analysis (SNA) for Reassignments:**
   - Visualize handoff patterns between agents using a handover network graph.
   - Identify frequent reassignment paths (e.g., L1  L2  L3 for certain ticket types).
   - Detect "hub" agents who frequently receive reassignments (potential bottlenecks).

2. **Role Discovery:**
   - Cluster agents based on their actual handled ticket types and skills (not just their tier).
   - Identify if some L2 agents frequently handle L1-like tasks (misalignment in skill utilization).

3. **Sequence Flow Analysis:**
   - Map common escalation paths (e.g., "Software-App  App-CRM  Database-SQL").
   - Identify loops (e.g., repeated reassignments for the same ticket).

4. **Conformance Checking:**
   - Compare actual assignment flows against the intended tiered model (e.g., "L1 should not escalate P4 tickets").
   - Flag deviations (e.g., L3 agents handling low-priority tickets).

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **Key Bottlenecks and Their Impact**
Using process mining and event log analysis, we can identify:

1. **Skill Mismatch Bottlenecks:**
   - Tickets requiring rare skills (e.g., "Security-IAM") may linger in queues while specialized agents are busy.
   - **Impact:** SLA breaches for high-priority tickets due to unavailability of skilled agents.

2. **Excessive Reassignments & Escalations:**
   - Frequent reassignments within L2 may indicate poor initial skill matching.
   - L1 agents escalating tickets prematurely due to lack of training or unclear guidelines.
   - **Impact:** Each reassignment adds ~15-30 mins delay (based on log timestamps).

3. **Overloaded vs. Underutilized Agents:**
   - Some L2 agents may handle 80% of "Networking-Firewall" tickets, while others are idle.
   - **Impact:** Uneven workload leads to burnout and inefficiency.

4. **Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
   - L1 agents may misclassify ticket categories, leading to wrong escalations (e.g., a "Network" ticket assigned to an "App-CRM" specialist).
   - **Impact:** 30% of reassignments could be avoided with better initial classification.

5. **SLA Breach Correlation:**
   - Cross-analyze SLA violations with assignment paths (e.g., tickets reassigned 3+ times are 5x more likely to breach SLA).

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes**
1. **Faulty Assignment Logic:**
   - Current round-robin assignment ignores skills and workload, leading to mismatches.

2. **Poor Ticket Classification:**
   - L1 agents may mislabel ticket categories, causing incorrect escalations.

3. **Skill Data Inaccuracy:**
   - Agent skill profiles may be outdated (e.g., an agent trained in "Database-SQL" isn’t flagged for such tickets).

4. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
   - Dispatchers may not see which agents are available or overloaded when assigning tickets.

5. **Over-Reliance on Escalations:**
   - L1 agents lack training on common issues (e.g., basic CRM troubleshooting), forcing escalations.

### **Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Analysis**
- **Variant Analysis:**
  - Compare "fast-path" tickets (resolved quickly) vs. "problematic paths" (multiple reassignments) to identify differences in initial assignment criteria.

- **Decision Mining:**
  - Extract rules governing escalation decisions (e.g., "If ticket category = Network AND agent lacks 'Networking' skill  Escalate").
  - Identify if certain agents consistently escalate specific ticket types.

## **4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

### **Proposed Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**
- **Problem Addressed:** Skill mismatches leading to reassignments.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use historical data to map ticket category/required skill  best-suited agent.
  - Weight assignments by agent proficiency (e.g., an agent with "App-CRM (Advanced)" gets priority over "App-CRM (Basic)").
- **Data Required:**
  - Agent skill matrices (from HR records + historical ticket resolution data).
  - Real-time agent availability and current workload.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Reduce reassignments by 40% (based on past misassignments).
  - Improve SLA compliance by 20% due to faster correct assignments.

#### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment**
- **Problem Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution.
- **Implementation:**
  - Assign tickets based on:
    1. Agent’s current queue length.
    2. Agent’s recent workload (e.g., avoid assigning if they’ve handled 3+ tickets in the last hour).
  - Balance between skill match and workload distribution.
- **Data Required:**
  - Real-time agent workload metrics (current open tickets, average resolution time).
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - 25% reduction in agent burnout (fewer overloaded agents).
  - 15% faster resolution times due to optimized assignments.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Using Ticket Text Analysis**
- **Problem Addressed:** Misclassification of tickets by L1.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use NLP on ticket descriptions to predict required skills (e.g., keywords like "firewall" auto-tag as "Networking-Firewall").
  - Combine with historical data (e.g., 80% of tickets with "SQL timeout" need "Database-SQL" skill).
- **Data Required:**
  - Historical ticket descriptions + correct skill assignments.
  - NLP-trained model to predict skill needs.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - 30% reduction in escalations due to better initial routing.

## **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

### **Simulation for Impact Assessment**
- Use **discrete-event simulation** to model the effect of new assignment strategies on:
  - Average resolution time.
  - Reassignment frequency.
  - SLA compliance rates.
- Compare against baseline (current process) to validate benefits before rollout.

### **Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan**
1. **Real-Time Dashboards:**
   - Track KPIs: Reassignment rate, first-call resolution rate, SLA compliance.
   - Monitor workload balance across agents/tiers.

2. **Continuous Process Mining:**
   - Run weekly variant analysis to detect emerging assignment inefficiencies.
   - Alert on sudden spikes in reassignments (indicating potential skill gaps or misclassifications).

3. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Use agent feedback on assignment accuracy to refine routing rules.
   - Adjust skill weighting based on resolution success rates.
