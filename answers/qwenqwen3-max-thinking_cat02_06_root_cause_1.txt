**Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process**

---

### **1. Identification of Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

We begin by calculating the **total resolution time** for each case—the duration between "Receive Ticket" and "Close Ticket."

| Case ID | Receive Time        | Close Time          | Total Resolution Time |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00    | 2024-03-01 10:15    | **2h 15m**             |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05    | 2024-03-02 09:15    | **25h 10m**            |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10    | 2024-03-01 09:30    | **1h 20m**             |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20    | 2024-03-02 08:30    | **24h 10m**            |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25    | 2024-03-03 09:30    | **49h 5m**             |

**Observation:**
- **Cases 102, 104, and especially 105** have resolution times **10–20× longer** than the fast-resolved cases (101 and 103).
- The **average resolution time** (excluding outliers) is ~1.7 hours; cases 102, 104, and 105 are clear outliers.

Thus, **Cases 102, 104, and 105** exhibit **significantly longer resolution times** and warrant deeper investigation.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis of Performance Delays**

We now examine **activity sequences and time gaps** to identify bottlenecks.

#### **Case 102**
- **Escalation occurs**: "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" at 11:30 on Day 1.
- **Long gap**: From escalation (11:30) to next "Investigate Issue" (14:00 same day)  **2.5-hour delay**.
- **Major delay**: From "Investigate Issue" (14:00 Day 1) to "Resolve Ticket" (09:00 Day 2)  **19-hour gap**, likely overnight.
- **Pattern**: Escalation introduces multi-day resolution.

#### **Case 104**
- **No explicit escalation**, but:
  - Assigned at 09:30  **Investigation starts only at 13:00**  **3.5-hour idle time**.
  - Then **19-hour gap** from investigation (13:00 Day 1) to resolution (08:00 Day 2).
- **Possible cause**: Issue complexity not captured by escalation flag; Level-1 agent unable to resolve, delayed handoff or internal research.

#### **Case 105**
- **Escalated** at 10:00 on Day 1.
- **Massive gap**: From escalation (10:00 Day 1) to next "Investigate Issue" (14:00 Day 2)  **28 hours**.
- Then another **19-hour gap** to resolution (09:00 Day 3).
- **Total idle time post-escalation**: ~47 hours (nearly 2 full days).

#### **Common Patterns Across Delayed Cases:**
| Factor | Observed in Cases | Impact |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **Escalation to Level-2** | 102, 105 | Strongly correlates with multi-day resolution |
| **Long idle time before investigation** | 104 (3.5h), 102/105 (post-escalation delays) | Suggests handoff inefficiencies or resource unavailability |
| **Overnight/weekend delays** | All delayed cases | Resolution only resumes next business day |
| **Missing “Reassign” or “Awaiting Input” events** | All | Log lacks visibility into waiting states, masking true bottlenecks |

> **Key Insight**: **Escalation is a critical predictor of long cycle times**, but even **non-escalated tickets (like 104)** can suffer long delays if Level-1 agents lack tools/knowledge, causing implicit delays before resolution.

### **3. Explanation of Impact & Recommendations**

#### **How These Factors Increase Cycle Time**
- **Escalation handoffs** often involve:
  - Queuing for Level-2 agents (who may have lower capacity).
  - Lack of SLA for escalation response.
  - Poor documentation passed during handoff, requiring re-investigation.
- **Unlogged waiting periods** (e.g., between assignment and investigation) indicate:
  - Agent overload.
  - Ambiguity in ticket ownership.
  - Absence of automated triggers or reminders.
- **Overnight delays** suggest the process is **not designed for continuous resolution**, and complex tickets stall until next business day.

#### **Recommendations to Reduce Delays**

1. **Improve Escalation Protocols**:
   - Define **clear criteria** for escalation to avoid premature or unnecessary escalations.
   - Implement **escalation SLAs** (e.g., Level-2 must acknowledge within 2 hours).
   - Require **structured handoff notes** to reduce rework.

2. **Enhance Visibility into Waiting States**:
   - Add explicit log events like “Awaiting Agent,” “Pending Customer Response,” or “In Escalation Queue.”
   - This enables accurate bottleneck detection via process mining.

3. **Empower Level-1 Agents**:
   - Provide better knowledge bases, decision trees, or AI-assisted diagnostics to reduce escalation need (as seen in Case 104).
   - Analyze why Case 104 wasn’t escalated despite long delays—was it a missed escalation?

4. **Monitor and Alert on Idle Tickets**:
   - Set automated alerts for tickets idle >2 hours in “Assigned” or “Escalated” states.
   - Assign backup agents or supervisors for follow-up.

5. **Analyze Resource Allocation**:
   - If Level-2 agents are a bottleneck, consider cross-training or adjusting staffing based on escalation volume.

### **Conclusion**

The primary driver of long resolution times is **escalation to Level-2 support**, which introduces significant handoff delays and multi-day resolution cycles. However, **delays can also occur without formal escalation** (Case 104), indicating systemic issues in agent enablement or process transparency. By improving escalation management, increasing process visibility, and empowering frontline agents, the organization can significantly reduce cycle times and improve customer satisfaction.
