**Analyzing normative and desiderata compliance**

I'm comparing each case step-by-step against normative rules and desirable practices, noting where sequences or timing deviate, especially missing required steps like "Inform Applicant" or premature finalizing. I plan to summarize compliance clearly per case, highlight normative breaches prominently, and mention desiderata gaps like missing follow-up calls, framing possible reasons for delays or violations. I'll package this all up in a structured, insightful final message.

### 1. Normative (hard-rule) compliance

| Case | Normative status | Explanation |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **1** |  Compliant | All mandatory activities executed in the prescribed order: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. No contradictory action after the decision. |
| **2** |  **Violations detected** | - **Ordering breach:** “Risk Assessment” was recorded before “Credit Check,” violating the mandated order.<br> - **Missing mandatory step:** No “Inform Applicant” activity after the loan decision, so the applicant was never formally informed.<br> - **Contradictory action:** “Finalize Documentation” was performed even though the loan was rejected, which is explicitly forbidden. |
| **3** |  Compliant | Activities occurred in the correct order and respected the decision logic (approved  documentation finalized  case closed). |

### 2. Desiderata (soft-rule) observations

| Case | Desiderata deviations | Remarks |
|------|-----------------------|---------|
| **1** | • No Follow-up Call recorded. | The preferred courtesy call before closure was missed, but this is not a hard violation. Timeliness recommendations were met (credit check within 24h; applicant informed within 2h of the decision). |
| **2** | • No Follow-up Call recorded. | Timing recommendations were met (credit check happened within an hour, decision-to-inform couldn’t be checked because the inform step was missing—a normative issue). |
| **3** | • Credit Check performed ~2 days after the application (later than the preferred 24h).<br>• Applicant informed ~51 hours after the decision (beyond the preferred 48h window).<br>• No Follow-up Call recorded. | These delays suggest a slow-moving case, but they do not break any hard rules. |

### 3. Possible interpretations and coaching hints

- **Case 1:** The team followed the mandatory sequence flawlessly. To align with best practices, they might consider adding the optional follow-up call—perhaps the applicant was already sufficiently informed via other channels.
  
- **Case 2:** The violations point to either a logging/order-of-execution mistake or a genuine procedural failure. Ensuring the credit check always precedes the risk assessment and that rejected cases are closed without documentation work should be emphasized in training. The missing “Inform Applicant” step is critical—regardless of the rejection, the applicant must be notified.

- **Case 3:** The lag between application  credit check and decision  informing the applicant might reflect workload peaks or waiting on external information. While still compliant, it might be worth investigating resource constraints or introducing SLA reminders to meet the recommended timeframes. Adding the optional follow-up call could help maintain customer satisfaction.

In summary: only Case 2 breaks compulsory rules; Cases 1 and 3 adhere to the strict process but could improve on recommended practices, especially around optional follow-up contact and, for Case 3, timeliness-of-service expectations.
