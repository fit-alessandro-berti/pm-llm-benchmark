Based on the provided declarative constraints, the process underlying this data can be described as follows:

1. Equivalence constraints indicate that certain activities must occur the same number of times within a case. For example, the 'Declaration FOR\_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' activity must occur the same number of times as the 'Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' activity. This suggests that the ADMINISTRATION entity initiates the approval process, and the SUPERVISOR entity gives the final approval.
2. Always Before constraints indicate that certain activities must occur before others. For example, the 'Declaration FOR\_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' activity must occur before the 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' activity. This suggests that the SUPERVISOR entity must approve the declaration before the EMPLOYEE can submit it.
3. Always After constraints indicate that certain activities must occur after others. For example, the 'Payment Handled' activity must occur after the 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' activity. This suggests that if the EMPLOYEE rejects the declaration, the payment cannot be handled.
4. Never Together constraints indicate that certain activities cannot occur within the same case. For example, the 'Declaration FOR\_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' activity cannot occur with the 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' activity. This suggests that if the ADMINISTRATION entity rejects the declaration, it cannot be approved by the SUPERVISOR entity.
5. Activity Occurrences constraints indicate the minimum and maximum number of times that an activity can occur within a case. For example, the 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' activity can occur between 0 and 7 times within a case. This suggests that the EMPLOYEE entity can submit the declaration multiple times if necessary.
6. Directly-Follows constraints indicate that certain activities must occur immediately after others. For example, the 'Declaration FOR\_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' activity must be directly followed by the 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' activity. This suggests that once the ADMINISTRATION entity initiates the approval process, the EMPLOYEE entity must immediately submit the declaration.

Overall, this process appears to be a workflow for handling declarations, where the ADMINISTRATION entity initiates the approval process, and the SUPERVISOR entity gives the final approval. The EMPLOYEE entity can submit the declaration multiple times if necessary, and the payment cannot be handled if the declaration is rejected by the EMPLOYEE. There are also various conditions under which the declaration can be rejected by different entities.
