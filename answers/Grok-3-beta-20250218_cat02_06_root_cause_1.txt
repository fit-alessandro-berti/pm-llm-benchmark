To analyze the "Customer Support Ticket Resolution" process and address the task, I’ll break it down into three parts: identifying cases with significantly longer resolution times, determining potential root causes of delays, and providing insights and recommendations. Let’s dive into the event log step-by-step.
1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times
First, I’ll calculate the total resolution time for each case, defined as the duration from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket." All timestamps are provided in a consistent format, so I’ll compute the time differences in hours (and minutes where necessary) and compare them to identify outliers.
Case 101:
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:00
Close: 2024-03-01 10:15
Duration: 10:15 - 08:00 = 2 hours 15 minutes (2.25 hours)
Case 102:
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:05
Close: 2024-03-02 09:15
Duration: (24 hours from 08:05 on March 1 to 08:05 on March 2) + 1 hour 10 minutes = 25 hours 10 minutes (25.17 hours)
Case 103:
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:10
Close: 2024-03-01 09:30
Duration: 09:30 - 08:10 = 1 hour 20 minutes (1.33 hours)
Case 104:
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:20
Close: 2024-03-02 08:30
Duration: (24 hours from 08:20 on March 1 to 08:20 on March 2) + 10 minutes = 24 hours 10 minutes (24.17 hours)
Case 105:
Receive: 2024-03-01 08:25
Close: 2024-03-03 09:30
Duration: (48 hours from 08:25 on March 1 to 08:25 on March 3) + 1 hour 5 minutes = 49 hours 5 minutes (49.08 hours)
Average Resolution Time:
Total time = 2.25 + 25.17 + 1.33 + 24.17 + 49.08 = 102 hours
Average = 102 / 5 = 20.4 hours
Cases Significantly Longer Than Average:
"Significantly longer" isn’t strictly defined, but let’s consider cases that exceed the average by a notable margin (e.g., >1.5x the average, or 30.6 hours). However, for practical insight, I’ll flag cases that stand out relative to the group:
Case 102: 25.17 hours (above average, but not extreme)
Case 104: 24.17 hours (above average, but not extreme)
Case 105: 49.08 hours (more than double the average—clearly significant)
Finding: Case 105 has a significantly longer resolution time (49.08 hours) compared to the average (20.4 hours). Cases 102 and 104 are also above average but closer to the mean, so I’ll focus primarily on Case 105 while noting trends in 102 and 104.
2. Determine Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues
Now, let’s examine the event logs for these cases to identify patterns or factors causing delays. I’ll look at escalations, waiting times between activities, and delays before key steps like investigation or resolution.
Case 101 (2.25 hours, efficient baseline):
Flow: Receive → Triage (10 min) → Assign (10 min) → Investigate (40 min) → Resolve (60 min) → Close (15 min)
No escalation, smooth progression, total time is short.
Case 103 (1.33 hours, fastest):
Flow: Receive → Triage (5 min) → Assign (15 min) → Investigate (15 min) → Resolve (30 min) → Close (15 min)
No escalation, quick triage and investigation, minimal delays.
Case 102 (25.17 hours, above average):
Flow: Receive → Triage (25 min) → Assign (30 min) → Escalate (2.5 hrs) → Investigate (2.5 hrs) → Resolve (19 hrs) → Close (15 min)
Key delays:
2.5 hours from Assign to Escalate.
2.5 hours from Escalate to Investigate.
19 hours from Investigate to Resolve (spans overnight).
Escalation introduced complexity and waiting time.
Case 104 (24.17 hours, above average):
Flow: Receive → Triage (40 min) → Assign (30 min) → Investigate (3.5 hrs) → Resolve (19 hrs) → Close (30 min)
Key delays:
3.5 hours from Assign to Investigate.
19 hours from Investigate to Resolve (spans overnight).
No escalation, but long gaps suggest agent unavailability or backlog.
Case 105 (49.08 hours, significantly delayed):
Flow: Receive → Triage (10 min) → Assign (25 min) → Investigate (10 min) → Escalate (50 min) → Investigate (28 hrs) → Resolve (19 hrs) → Close (30 min)
Key delays:
28 hours from Escalate to second Investigate (spans overnight into next day).
19 hours from Investigate to Resolve (spans another night).
Escalation occurred early, but the handoff to Level-2 took excessively long, and resolution lagged.
Patterns and Root Causes:
Escalations Cause Delays:
Cases 102 and 105 involved escalations to Level-2 agents, and both have longer resolution times (25.17 and 49.08 hours) compared to non-escalated cases (1.33–24.17 hours).
In Case 105, the 28-hour gap after escalation suggests a bottleneck in Level-2 availability or prioritization.
Long Waiting Times Between Activities:
Cases 102, 104, and 105 show multi-hour delays between steps, especially before "Investigate" or "Resolve." For example:
Case 102: 2.5 hours from Escalate to Investigate.
Case 104: 3.5 hours from Assign to Investigate.
Case 105: 28 hours from Escalate to Investigate.
These gaps indicate idle time, possibly due to agent workload or scheduling issues.
Overnight Delays:
Cases 102, 104, and 105 span multiple days, with large gaps (e.g., 19 hours in 102 and 104, 28 hours in 105) occurring overnight. This suggests limited support availability outside business hours.
Investigation-to-Resolution Lag:
In Cases 102, 104, and 105, the time from "Investigate" to "Resolve" is consistently long (19–28 hours), hinting at inefficiencies in finalizing solutions after identifying the issue.
3. Explain Factors and Propose Recommendations
How These Factors Increase Cycle Times:
Escalations: Transferring tickets to Level-2 agents introduces handoff delays, as seen in Case 105’s 28-hour wait. If Level-2 teams are understaffed or slow to respond, tickets languish.
Waiting Times: Long gaps between activities (e.g., 3.5 hours in Case 104, 28 hours in Case 105) reflect inefficiencies in agent assignment or prioritization, leaving tickets idle.
Overnight Delays: The process halts outside business hours, as evident in multi-day cases (102, 104, 105). This triples resolution times compared to same-day cases like 101 and 103.
Resolution Lag: Prolonged "Investigate" to "Resolve" steps suggest agents struggle to finalize fixes, possibly due to complexity, lack of resources, or approval delays.
Recommendations:
Optimize Escalation Process:
Increase Level-2 staffing or implement a faster handoff protocol (e.g., real-time escalation alerts) to reduce waits like the 28 hours in Case 105.
Train Level-1 agents to handle more issues, minimizing escalations (e.g., only 2 of 5 cases escalated).
Reduce Idle Time:
Use a ticket prioritization system to ensure prompt assignment and investigation, cutting delays like the 3.5 hours in Case 104.
Monitor agent workloads to prevent backlogs.
Extend Support Hours:
Introduce a skeleton crew or on-call agents for overnight shifts to handle investigation and resolution, avoiding 19–28-hour gaps in multi-day cases.
Streamline Resolution:
Provide agents with better tools, documentation, or authority to resolve issues faster after investigation, targeting the 19-hour lags seen in Cases 102, 104, and 105.
Insight: The fastest cases (101, 103) resolve same-day without escalation, averaging ~1.8 hours. Escalated or multi-day cases balloon to 24–49 hours. Focusing on escalation efficiency and 24/7 coverage could bring average times closer to the 2-hour benchmark set by efficient cases.
Summary
Significantly Delayed Case: Case 105 (49.08 hours).
Root Causes: Escalations, long waiting times, overnight delays, and resolution lags.
Recommendations: Optimize escalations, reduce idle time, extend hours, and streamline resolution.
