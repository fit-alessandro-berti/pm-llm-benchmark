Anomalies in the constraint set
- Noncoexistence of E with C combined with existence of C: Because C is mandated to occur, E becomes impossible in any conformant trace. This makes evaluation structurally forbidden and undermines the intended process.
- Responded-existence EA becomes vacuous: Since E cannot occur, the rule “if E then A exists” is never activated. It offers no real control.
- Precedence CR is redundant with init R: If R must be the first event, then “C must be preceded by R” adds no additional restriction.
- Ordering and dependency are too weak or missing:
  - A is not required to precede E (responded-existence does not enforce order), allowing E before A if E were allowed.
  - No requirement that E precede P, P precede N, and N precede C.
  - P and N are not required to exist at all.
- End-state not enforced and cardinalities are unclear:
  - C is not required to be the last event.
  - Multiple Cs are not disallowed.
  - R is not constrained to occur exactly once.
- The model allows undesired fast-track paths such as RC with all middle steps skipped.

Hypotheses about root causes
- Misused templates: Noncoexistence may have been chosen instead of precedence or response (e.g., intending “no C before E” but encoding “no C with E”).
- Confusion between responded-existence and response/precedence: The designer may have intended “A before E” but picked a template that does not enforce order.
- Incremental policy change: A fast-track or “no-evaluation” path for small claims may have been introduced, but other constraints were not updated consistently.
- Discovery artifacts: If the model was discovered from noisy/incomplete logs, missing E events could have pushed the miner toward noncoexistence(E,C) to maximize fitness.
- Technical limitations: Event labels or resources may be inconsistent (e.g., evaluation logged under different activity codes), leading to constraints that fit incomplete data rather than business rules.
- Performance pressure: Stakeholders may have favored rapid closure, tolerating models that permit skipping evaluation, approval, or notification.

SQL checks to verify anomalies and their operational impact

A. Core contradictions and skips
1) Claims closed without any evaluation
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;

2) Claims where E and C coexist (violates noncoexistence)
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0;

3) Direct fast-track closures (only R and C, no A/E/P/N)
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN ce.activity IN ('A','E','P','N') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0;

B. Ordering and completeness of key steps
4) First event is not R (violates init)
WITH ordered AS (
  SELECT claim_id, activity,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp, event_id) AS rn
  FROM claim_events
)
SELECT claim_id
FROM ordered
WHERE rn = 1 AND activity <> 'R';

5) Last event is not C (C not enforced as terminal)
WITH last_evt AS (
  SELECT claim_id, activity,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp DESC, event_id DESC) AS rn
  FROM claim_events
)
SELECT claim_id
FROM last_evt
WHERE rn = 1 AND activity <> 'C';

6) Multiple closings
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS close_events
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'C'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

7) E occurs but A is absent (violates responded-existence intent)
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;

8) E precedes first A or A is missing (order too weak)
SELECT claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS first_a,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS first_e
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
   AND (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) IS NULL
        OR MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) < MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END));

9) Approvals without evaluation
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;

10) Notifications without approval
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;

C. Adjuster-related checks
11) Evaluation performed by a resource not recognized as an adjuster (by name or numeric ID in resource)
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.event_id, ce.resource
FROM claim_events ce
LEFT JOIN adjusters a
  ON a.name = ce.resource
     OR (ce.resource ~ '^\d+$' AND a.adjuster_id = ce.resource::int)
WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
  AND a.adjuster_id IS NULL;

12) Evaluation performed by someone other than the assigned adjuster (requires the A event to encode an assigned adjuster ID in additional_info, e.g., 'adjuster_id=123')
WITH assignments AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.timestamp, ce.event_id,
         substring(ce.additional_info FROM 'adjuster_id=(\d+)')::int AS assigned_adjuster_id
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity = 'A' AND ce.additional_info ~ 'adjuster_id=\d+'
),
evals AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.event_id, ce.timestamp, ce.resource,
         CASE WHEN ce.resource ~ '^\d+$' THEN ce.resource::int END AS evaluator_id
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
),
latest_assignment_per_eval AS (
  SELECT e.claim_id, e.event_id, e.timestamp,
         (SELECT a.assigned_adjuster_id
            FROM assignments a
           WHERE a.claim_id = e.claim_id
             AND a.timestamp <= e.timestamp
           ORDER BY a.timestamp DESC, a.event_id DESC
           LIMIT 1) AS assigned_adjuster_id,
         e.evaluator_id, e.resource
  FROM evals e
)
SELECT la.claim_id, la.event_id, la.assigned_adjuster_id, la.evaluator_id, la.resource
FROM latest_assignment_per_eval la
WHERE la.assigned_adjuster_id IS NOT NULL
  AND (la.evaluator_id IS NULL OR la.evaluator_id <> la.assigned_adjuster_id);

13) Evaluator specialization mismatches the claim type (heuristic mapping)
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.event_id, ce.resource, a.specialization, c.claim_type
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a
  ON a.name = ce.resource
     OR (ce.resource ~ '^\d+$' AND a.adjuster_id = ce.resource::int)
WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
  AND a.adjuster_id IS NOT NULL
  AND (
        (c.claim_type LIKE 'home%' AND a.specialization <> 'home') OR
        (c.claim_type LIKE 'auto%' AND a.specialization <> 'auto')
      );

Notes for execution
- If additional_info uses a different key for the assigned adjuster, adapt the regex in query 12.
- If resource consistently holds adjuster_id (or name), simplify joins accordingly.
- For deterministic ordering when timestamps tie, event_id is included in ORDER BY clauses.
