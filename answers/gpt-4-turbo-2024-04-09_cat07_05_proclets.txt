The visualization consists of three parts (a), (b), and (c) that detail different aspects of a lab testing process, particularly how data flows, is processed, and interacts in a healthcare setting.

(a) Two Prolect Classes Connected Through Two Channels:
This part of the visualization illustrates the process flow and interactions between different roles (like the doctor, lab assistant) and systems (like the order system and HIS or Health Information System) during a lab visit. The diagram shows the sequence of steps from taking a blood sample to judging the results and then either concluding the process if everything is fine or redoing the tests if necessary. The broken lines indicate data flow or interactions through two channels.

(b) Class Diagram Containing the Two Prolect Classes:
This is a simple class diagram that shows the relationship between “Lab test” and “Lab visit.” The arrow connecting these indicates that a Lab visit "requires" one or many Lab tests, which is depicted by the multiplicity notation "1..*" next to Lab Test.

(c) Example of a Performatives:
This table provides a mock-up of a message log format showing how communications might be recorded during a lab test process. It logs an order entry at 11:00 AM where the lab system sends a lab test request (HGB test for John) to the lab assistant, denoted as a private and outgoing message. This illustrative performative captures typical data fields like Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, and Direction.

Overall, the visualization serves to explain the procedural and informational exchanges required in medical lab operations, detailing interactions between different roles and data systems, represented both as a flow diagram and supporting class relationships and communication logs.
