### Proposed High-Level Activities and Rationale

#### Case A1
**High-Level Activities:**

1. **Material Preparation:**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

   **Rationale:** These events involve setting up the raw material for further processing. Retrieving, scanning, and placing the part are preparatory actions. Aligning and preheating ensure the part is ready for the next step.

2. **Assembly:**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B

   **Rationale:** These events involve the actual assembly of the product, specifically the welding process. The act of picking up the tool precedes the welding actions, and both are crucial steps in constructing the final product.

3. **Quality Inspection:**
   - Measure weld integrity

   **Rationale:** This step involves checking the quality of the welding done in the previous step. It is a critical point where potential defects are identified before further processing.

4. **Finishing:**
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating

   **Rationale:** These events focus on adding a final touch to the product, ensuring it meets quality and safety standards. Applying a coating and drying it complete the finishing process.

5. **Quality Check:**
   - Visual check

   **Rationale:** This is the final quality control step, where a visual inspection is conducted to ensure the product complies with all requirements before it can be considered finished.

#### Case B2
**High-Level Activities:**

1. **Material Preparation:**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

   **Rationale:** Similar to Case A1, these events set up the raw material for processing. They involve preparing the part for assembly.

2. **Assembly:**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B

   **Rationale:** These events focus on assembling the product, specifically through welding. The sequence of actions suggests a logical flow from picking the tool to performing the welding tasks.

3. **Quality Inspection:**
   - Measure weld integrity

   **Rationale:** This step ensures that the welds meet the required standards. It is essential before moving on to additional finishing steps.

4. **Finishing:**
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating

   **Rationale:** These activities finalize the product, enhancing its durability and appearance. They follow the assembly and inspection stages.

5. **Quality Check:**
   - Visual check

   **Rationale:** This final step ensures that all previous processes were completed successfully, and the product is ready for distribution or further handling.
