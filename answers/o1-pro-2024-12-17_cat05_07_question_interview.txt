1. **Documentation and Verification:**  
   - Could you walk me through the criteria you use to determine whether a property’s documentation is complete and acceptable, and what your escalation steps are if the landlord cannot provide these documents in a timely manner?  
   - How do you handle situations where regional housing regulations differ significantly from the standard documents you expect, and what adjustments do you make to your verification process?

2. **Property Manager Assignment:**  
   - What factors weigh most heavily when choosing a property manager for a new property, and how do you prioritize these factors if there are conflicts (e.g., manager workload vs. geographic expertise)?  
   - How do you document the rationale behind assigning a particular property manager to ensure transparency and fairness in the decision-making process?

3. **Introductory Meeting Between Manager and Landlord:**  
   - How do you structure the initial conversation between the assigned property manager and the landlord to ensure all necessary topics are covered?  
   - If the landlord requests non-standard lease terms or special policies during this meeting, what is the process for evaluating and approving these exceptions?

4. **Property Preparation (Photography and Inspection):**  
   - Could you clarify the sequence of scheduling inspections and photography—do these happen concurrently or must the property meet certain criteria before photography is done?  
   - How do you handle properties that fail initial inspections—both in terms of communicating repair requirements to the landlord and ensuring timely re-inspection?

5. **Marketing and Pricing:**  
   - Can you elaborate on how market trends influence the final rental price, and what steps are taken to reconcile landlord expectations with current market conditions?  
   - How do you approach branding or positioning the property if it fits into a niche category (e.g., luxury, student housing)? Do you have a standard marketing template, or is it highly customized?

6. **Activation and Tenant Screening:**  
   - How do you manage the timing between making a property “available” on the portal and actually starting the tenant screening process—are there safeguards to prevent inquiries before the property is fully ready for applicants?  
   - Can you describe how you handle conflicts when multiple qualified applicants are interested, and how you maintain fairness and compliance in these situations?

7. **Lease Finalization and Move-In:**  
   - What criteria do you use to determine if lease clauses are standard or if they require extra legal or compliance review?  
   - How do you coordinate the move-in logistics with the tenant, landlord, and potentially other stakeholders (e.g., maintenance teams, utility providers) to ensure a smooth transition?

8. **Quality Checks and Internal Audits:**  
   - Could you provide more detail on the role of the compliance officer and financial analyst—when they step in, what they specifically review, and how their feedback is integrated back into the onboarding process?  
   - How are issues surfaced during these audits tracked and resolved, and what communication channels are used to keep all parties informed?

9. **Exception Handling and Special Cases:**  
   - How do you handle properties that require unique insurance policies or additional certifications—do you have a separate workflow for these exceptions?  
   - If a landlord insists on custom lease clauses that could introduce risk or complexity, how do you handle the approval process, and what controls are in place to ensure compliance with regulations?

10. **Communication and Tracking:**  
    - How do you ensure that communication across emails, CRMs, and project management tools remains centralized and accessible to all relevant stakeholders throughout the process?  
    - Can you describe how you track decision points and ensure that everyone involved—property managers, landlords, inspectors, marketing teams—is working with the most up-to-date information at all times?

11. **Continuous Improvement:**  
    - How do you measure the success and efficiency of your onboarding process, and what feedback loops are in place to continually refine and improve it?  
    - Are there any recurring pain points or bottlenecks you’ve identified in the process, and what strategies have you considered for resolving them?
