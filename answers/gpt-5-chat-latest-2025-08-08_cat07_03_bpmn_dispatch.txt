This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** showing the workflow for shipping goods within an organization.  

The business process is divided into **three swimlanes**:  

1. **Logistics**  
2. **Dispatch of goods - Computer Hardware Shop Secretary**  
3. **Warehouse**  

### **Process Flow Description**
---

#### **1. Start**
- The process begins with the **"Ship goods"** event.

#### **2. Clarify Shipment Method**
- The first step is a **parallel gateway** (a plus sign in a diamond), indicating concurrent tasks will occur.
- One path goes to **"Clarify shipment method"** based on **Order details**.

#### **3. Special Handling Decision**
- There's an **exclusive gateway** (X in a diamond) that determines if special handling is required:
  - **No:** The process moves to **Check if insurance is required** (using customer information).
  - **Yes:** The process goes to **Get 3 offers from logistic companies** and then to **Select logistic company and place order**.

#### **4. Insurance Decision**
- After checking if insurance is required:
  - If insurance is needed, the process continues to **"Insure parcel"** in the Logistics lane.
  - Regardless, the process reaches **Write package label**.

#### **5. Merge Paths**
- The **package label** and **special handling order** paths merge and continue.

#### **6. Package Goods in Warehouse**
- Parallel to the clerical tasks, the **Warehouse lane** handles **Packaging goods**.
- If packaging takes more than **48 hours**, the customer is **notified about the delay**.
- After packaging is ready, it merges with the other flow.

#### **7. Shipment Preparation**
- After packaging, the process continues with:
  - **Fill out shipment paperwork**
  - **Move package to pickup area**
- Finally, the process ends with **Shipment prepared** (end event).

---

### **Notable Features**
- **Parallel Gateways** are used to perform warehouse packing while shipment arrangements are made.
- **Exclusive Gateways** handle decision-making (e.g., insurance requirement, special handling).
- **Intermediate timer event** (clock symbol, 48 hours) monitors delay and triggers customer notification if exceeded.
- Swimlanes clearly separate responsibilities between logistics, office staff, and warehouse.

If you'd like, I can **convert this BPMN into a step-by-step textual Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** for easier reading and execution. Would you like me to do that?
