log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'D'),  # Every received order must eventually be dispatched (and vice versa in successful cases)

 **CORRECTION and FINAL VERSION (after fixing logic errors):**

The `'always_before'` constraint was incorrectly defined. Let’s fix it and ensure all constraints are logically consistent with a typical order fulfillment flow.

###  **Final Corrected Log Skeleton**

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'D'),    # Every received order that completes must be dispatched; and every dispatch implies an RO
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Packing and label generation are equivalent — one implies the other
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RI'),   # Check Availability must occur before Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),   # Reserve Items before Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),   # Pick Items before Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),   # Quality Check before Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Pack Order before Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),   # Generate Shipping Label before Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),    # Dispatch before Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP'),   # Invoice before Record Payment
        ('RO', 'CA'),   # Receive Order must occur before Check Availability
        ('RO', 'D'),    # Receive Order must occur before Dispatch (redundant with equivalence but safe)
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),   # After RO comes CA
        ('CA', 'RI'),   # After CA comes RI
        ('RI', 'PI'),   # After RI comes PI
        ('PI', 'QC'),   # After PI comes QC
        ('QC', 'PO'),   # After QC comes PO
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # After PO comes GSL
        ('GSL', 'D'),   # After GSL comes D
        ('D', 'IC'),    # After D comes IC
        ('IC', 'RP'),   # After IC comes RP (if occurs)
    },
    'never_together': set(),  # No conflicting activities in successful path
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {0, 1},   # Payment recording may be pending
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
    }
}
```

###  Notes:

- **Equivalence** between `RO` and `D` assumes we are modeling only completed, successful cases. In real logs, you might relax this if failed orders exist.
- **RP** (Record Payment) is allowed 0 or 1 times to account for cases where payment is not yet recorded (e.g., invoiced but not paid).
- **Directly-follows** captures common immediate transitions, though in practice there may be delays or parallel steps — this reflects an idealized efficient process.
- **Always Before/After** are complementary and sometimes redundant — included for robustness and clarity.

This Log Skeleton ensures the process follows a logical, traceable flow from order receipt to payment recording, with appropriate constraints to enforce correctness.
