 Sure, here's an example Python code to implement a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process tree using pm4py:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define the root node of the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Define the activities (leaf nodes)
order_approval = ProcessTree(label="Order approval", parent=root)
order_items = ProcessTree(label="Order items", parent=root)
invoice_receipt = ProcessTree(label="Invoice receipt", parent=root)
payment = ProcessTree(label="Payment", parent=root)

# Define the subprocesses (internal nodes)
order_process = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
invoice_process = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)

# Define the children nodes of each subprocess
order_approval_and_items = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=order_process)
invoice_receipt_or_payment = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=invoice_process)
order_items_and_invoice_receipt = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=invoice_receipt_or_payment)

# Set the children of each subprocess node
order_approval_and_items.children.append(order_approval)
order_approval_and_items.children.append(order_items)
order_process.children.append(order_approval_and_items)

invoice_receipt_or_payment.children.append(invoice_receipt)
invoice_receipt_or_payment.children.append(payment)
invoice_process.children.append(invoice_receipt_or_payment)

root.children.append(order_process)
root.children.append(invoice_process)
```
In this example, the Purchase-to-Pay process tree is structured as follows:

* The root node consists of two subprocesses (internal nodes) executed in sequence: the order process
