We are given interview transcripts from five different stakeholders describing the invoice approval process. We need to consolidate these into a structured, textual BPMN-like model.

 Steps:
 1. Identify the main activities/tasks.
 2. Determine the sequence flow and decision points.
 3. Assign roles to tasks where possible.
 4. Note any artifacts (like invoices, POs) and exceptions.
 5. Handle any inconsistencies or variations.

 Let's extract the common flow and variations:

 From Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk):
   - Receive invoice (by email)
   - Check for PO number: 
        If no PO -> send back to supplier
        If PO -> log into accounting system
   - Forward to Purchasing (Dan) for confirmation of receipt of goods/services.
   - After confirmation, match invoice line items against PO.
        If matches -> send to manager (Carlos) for approval.
        If discrepancy -> email Purchasing to clarify -> if unresolved, escalate to supervisor (Rita).
   - After approval, schedule payment.

 From Dan (Purchasing Officer):
   - Receives invoice from AP (Mary).
   - Compares invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) with PO.
        If discrepancy -> contact supplier or ask AP to hold until corrected.
        If correct -> send confirmation to AP.
   - Also mentions: if PO missing, tell Mary to get PO number.

 From Carlos (Department Manager):
   - Receives notification after PO match and Purchasing confirmation.
   - Approves if everything looks good.
   - If suspicious, rejects or asks to hold and investigate.

 From Rita (Accounts Payable Supervisor):
   - Handles exceptions: 
        - When invoice cannot be matched or discrepancy unresolved.
        - Invoices without PO (for informal services) -> work with department heads to create retrospective PO or reject.
   - After resolving, goes back to normal flow.

 From Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager):
   - Involved when there are issues (missing PO, pricing discrepancy). 
   - Contacts supplier to resolve.

 Now, let's map the standard flow and exceptions:

 Standard Flow:
  1. Receive Invoice (by email) [Role: Accounts Payable Clerk]
  2. Check for PO Number [Role: Accounts Payable Clerk]
        - If no PO: Send back to supplier (End for now, but supplier might resubmit)
        - If PO: Log into system and forward to Purchasing for confirmation.
  3. Purchasing Confirmation [Role: Purchasing Officer]
        - Compare invoice with PO.
        - If discrepancy: 
             a. Contact supplier (or ask AP to hold) -> wait for corrected invoice -> then back to step 3? 
             b. Alternatively, escalate if needed? (But note: Dan says they contact supplier or ask AP to hold)
        - If correct: Send confirmation to AP.
  4. Match Invoice Line Items [Role: Accounts Payable Clerk] 
        - This step is mentioned by Mary after Purchasing confirmation. But note: Dan's step already includes comparing. 
          However, Mary says she does the matching after Purchasing confirms receipt. 
          Let's reconcile: 
            Mary: After logging, forward to Purchasing for confirmation of receipt -> then she matches the invoice against PO.
          But Dan says he compares quantities, prices, etc. 
          It seems there might be two checks: 
            - Purchasing confirms receipt and also checks the details? 
          Alternatively, we can consider that the matching is done by Purchasing? 

  However, note Mary says: "Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system." 
  So she does the matching after Purchasing confirms the receipt? But Dan says he compares the details. 

  Let's clarify: 
    Mary: 
        Step 1: Check PO -> log -> forward to Purchasing to confirm receipt (of goods/services).
        Step 2: After confirmation, she matches the invoice against PO.

    Dan:
        When he receives the invoice, he compares the details (quantities, prices) with the PO.

  This seems redundant? Or perhaps the confirmation from Purchasing is about the receipt of goods, and then Mary does the matching? 

  But Dan says: "I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges." 

  We have two possibilities:
    Possibility 1: The process has two checks: 
        - Purchasing confirms the goods were received and also checks the details? 
        - Then Mary does a second check? 

    Possibility 2: There might be a misunderstanding. 

  Looking at Carlos: He says he sees the invoice details, PO, and confirmation. 

  And Rita: She escalates when there are discrepancies.

  Let's consolidate: 
    It appears that the Purchasing Officer (Dan) is responsible for verifying that the goods were received and that the invoice matches the PO in terms of quantities, prices, etc. 
    Then Mary (AP Clerk) does a system matching? Maybe she is entering the data and the system does an automatic match? 

  However, Mary says: "I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system". 

  We can model:
    After Purchasing confirms (which includes their check), then Mary does a system match? 

  But note: Mary says if there's a discrepancy, she emails Purchasing. So she is the one who finds the discrepancy? 

  Alternatively, we can interpret that the Purchasing confirmation step includes their check, and then Mary does a formal matching in the system? 

  Given the confusion, we'll note:

    After Purchasing confirms (which includes their manual check of quantities, prices, etc.), then the AP Clerk does a system matching (which might be an automated step in the system? or manual?).

  But Mary says: "I match", so it's manual? 

  Let's assume that the Purchasing Officer does the first check and then the AP Clerk does a second check? 

  However, to avoid redundancy, it might be that the system matching is done by the AP Clerk using the system, and that step is after Purchasing has confirmed the receipt and their own check? 

  We'll model it as two steps:

    Step 3: Purchasing Confirmation (by Purchasing Officer) - which includes checking the details against the PO and confirming receipt.
    Step 4: AP Clerk matches the invoice against PO in the system (which might be a formality? or a system step?).

  But note: if the Purchasing Officer already checked, why would the AP Clerk check again? 

  Another possibility: The Purchasing Officer only confirms the receipt of goods, and the AP Clerk does the matching? 

  Let's re-read Mary: 
      "After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system."

  So Purchasing only confirms receipt? Then the matching is done by AP? 

  But Dan says: "I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges." 

  This is a conflict. 

  We must consolidate: 
      In Interview 2, Dan says he checks the details. 
      In Interview 1, Mary says Purchasing confirms receipt and then she does the matching.

  How to resolve? 
      We note the inconsistency and model both possibilities? 

  Alternatively, we can assume that the Purchasing Officer does check the details as part of confirming the receipt? But Mary doesn't mention that. 

  Let's look at Carlos: He sees the invoice, PO, and confirmation. 

  And Rita: When there are discrepancies, she is escalated to.

  We'll model:

      After Purchasing confirms (which includes both confirming receipt and checking the details), then the AP Clerk does a system matching? 

  But Mary says she does the matching after Purchasing confirms receipt. 

  We'll break down:

      Task: Confirm Receipt and Validate Details [Role: Purchasing Officer] 
          - This task includes confirming that the goods were received and that the invoice details (quantities, prices) match the PO.

      Then, Task: System Matching [Role: Accounts Payable Clerk] 
          - This might be an automated or manual step in the system? But Mary says she does it.

  However, if Purchasing already validated the details, why would the AP Clerk do it again? 

  Given the conflict, we'll note:

      There is some ambiguity in the process. Some stakeholders indicate that Purchasing does the detailed check, while the AP Clerk then does a system matching (which might be a formality or a system step). 

  To simplify and avoid redundancy, we can combine:

      We'll have one matching step: 

          Step: Validate Invoice against PO [Role: Purchasing Officer] 
          But then Mary says she does the matching? 

  Alternatively, we can interpret that the Purchasing Officer does the manual check and then the AP Clerk enters the data and the system does an automatic match? 

  Let's assume:

      After Purchasing confirms (which includes manual check), the AP Clerk enters the invoice into the system and the system does an automatic match? 

  But Mary says: "I match", meaning manually? 

  We'll have to represent the two steps separately and note the ambiguity.

  Proposed flow:

      After Purchasing confirms (which includes manual check of details), then the AP Clerk performs a system matching? 

  But note: Mary says if there's a discrepancy, she emails Purchasing. So she is the one who finds the discrepancy? 

  This suggests that the Purchasing step might not be catching discrepancies? 

  Given the inconsistency, we will model:

      Step 3: Purchasing Confirmation [Role: Purchasing Officer]
          - This step confirms the receipt of goods and checks the details? But the transcript doesn't explicitly say that Purchasing checks the details? 

      Actually, Mary says Purchasing confirms receipt. Dan says he checks the details. 

  We can split:

      Step 3: Confirm Receipt of Goods [Role: Purchasing Officer] 
          - Purchasing Officer confirms that the goods were received.

      Step 4: Match Invoice against PO [Role: Accounts Payable Clerk]
          - The AP Clerk matches the invoice line items against the PO in the system.

  Then, if there is a discrepancy at step 4, the AP Clerk emails Purchasing to clarify? 

  But Dan says when he receives the invoice, he checks the details. 

  This suggests that step 3 (Purchasing) might include both? 

  We have a conflict. 

  Let's resolve by looking at the overall process:

      The process as described by Mary:

          1. Receive invoice -> check PO -> if no PO, send back.
          2. If PO, log and forward to Purchasing to confirm receipt.
          3. After confirmation, match invoice against PO (by AP Clerk).
          4. If match, send to manager. If not, email Purchasing.

      Dan's description:

          He receives the invoice from AP -> checks details (quantities, prices) -> if discrepancy, contact supplier or ask AP to hold -> if correct, send confirmation.

      So Dan's step is clearly checking the details. 

      Therefore, we can interpret that when Mary forwards to Purchasing for "confirmation of receipt", Purchasing actually does a detailed check? 

      And then Mary does a system matching? 

      But why would Mary do a matching after Purchasing already checked? 

      It might be that the system matching is a required step in the system? 

  We'll model:

      Step 3: Validate Invoice Details [Role: Purchasing Officer]
          - This includes confirming receipt and checking quantities, prices, etc.

      Step 4: System Matching [Role: Accounts Payable Clerk]
          - This is a step in the accounting system to match the invoice against the PO. 
          - If the system finds a discrepancy, then the AP Clerk emails Purchasing? 

  But note: Mary says she does the matching manually? 

  Alternatively, we can consider that the Purchasing step is the detailed check and the AP Clerk step is just a formality? 

  Given the time, we'll go with:

      After Purchasing validates (which includes both receipt and details), then the AP Clerk does a system step (which might be automated) to record the match? 

  But Mary says: "I match", meaning she does it. 

  We'll represent:

      Task: "Confirm Receipt and Validate Invoice Details" by Purchasing Officer.
      Then, Task: "Record Invoice and Perform System Matching" by Accounts Payable Clerk.

  And if the system matching fails (or if the AP Clerk finds a discrepancy), then she emails Purchasing? 

  This seems redundant. 

  Another idea: 

      The Purchasing Officer does the manual check and then the AP Clerk does the same check in the system? 

  We'll note the ambiguity and proceed.

  Standard flow:

      1. Receive Invoice (AP Clerk)
      2. Check for PO (AP Clerk)
          - No PO: Send back to supplier (End, or wait for resubmission)
          - With PO: Log into system and forward to Purchasing.
      3. Validate Invoice Details (Purchasing Officer): 
          - Check quantities, prices, etc. against PO and confirm receipt.
          - If discrepancy: 
               a. Contact supplier (via Karen? or directly) -> wait for corrected invoice -> then back to step 3? 
               b. Or ask AP to hold? 
          - If correct: Send confirmation to AP.
      4. System Matching (AP Clerk): 
          - This step is done in the system. 
          - If matches: Proceed to manager approval.
          - If discrepancy: Email Purchasing to clarify -> which might lead to contacting the supplier again? 

  But note: Step 3 already checked the details? So step 4 should always match? 

  This is confusing.

  Let's assume that step 4 is a system step that might catch discrepancies that were missed? Or it might be a formality? 

  Alternatively, we can remove step 4 as a separate task and consider that the system matching is part of step 2 (logging) or step 3? 

  Given the confusion, we'll follow Mary's description and have:

      After Purchasing confirms receipt (step 3), then the AP Clerk does the matching (step 4). 

  And if there is a discrepancy at step 4, she emails Purchasing (step 3 again?).

  But Dan says he does the detailed check when he receives the invoice from AP. 

  So we'll have:

      Step 3: Purchasing Officer confirms receipt and validates details? 
          - But Mary only says "confirm that the goods or services were actually received". 

  We'll stick to the literal from Mary for step 3: "confirm that the goods or services were actually received". Then step 4: AP Clerk matches.

  Then, if at step 4 there is a discrepancy, the AP Clerk emails Purchasing (Dan) to clarify. 

  Dan then might contact the supplier? 

  So:

      Step 4: Match Invoice against PO (AP Clerk) -> if discrepancy, go to step 3a: Resolve Discrepancy (Purchasing Officer) 

  But step 3a is not the same as step 3? 

  We'll model:

      Step 3: Confirm Receipt (Purchasing Officer) -> if they haven't received, then what? But the process doesn't say. 
          - We assume they only confirm if received? 

      Step 4: Match Invoice (AP Clerk) -> if discrepancy, then go to a new step: Resolve Discrepancy (which involves Purchasing Officer and possibly Supplier Relationship Manager).

  This seems to align with Rita's and Karen's roles.

  Let's restructure the standard flow without the exception:

      Start -> Receive Invoice (AP Clerk) -> Check PO -> [No PO] -> Send back to supplier
                [With PO] -> Log and forward to Purchasing -> Confirm Receipt (Purchasing Officer) -> 
                Match Invoice against PO (AP Clerk) -> [Match] -> Send to Manager for Approval -> 
                [Approved] -> Schedule Payment -> End

  Exceptions:

      At Check PO:
          - If no PO, send back. But note: Rita says sometimes they create a retrospective PO for informal services.

      At Confirm Receipt (Purchasing Officer):
          - What if the goods haven't been received? The interviews don't mention. We assume they only get invoices after receipt? 

      At Match Invoice (AP Clerk):
          - If discrepancy: 
                AP Clerk emails Purchasing to clarify -> Purchasing Officer then tries to resolve (contact supplier or ask for corrected invoice) -> 
                If resolved, go back to Match Invoice? Or to Confirm Receipt? 
                If not resolved, escalate to Rita (AP Supervisor).

      At Manager Approval (Carlos):
          - If suspicious, reject or ask to hold -> then what? 
                He might ask Mary to investigate -> which might lead to involving Purchasing or Rita? 

  Also, note Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager) is involved in resolving discrepancies.

  We'll model the exceptions:

      Exception 1: Missing PO at the beginning.
          - Option: Send back to supplier (standard)
          - But Rita: For informal services, she works to create retrospective PO or reject.

          So we can have:
              [No PO] -> 
                  Option A: Send back to supplier (and the process ends for that invoice until resubmitted)
                  Option B: If it's an informal service, escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita) -> 
                      Rita works with department heads -> 
                         [Create retrospective PO] -> then proceed as with PO (log and forward to Purchasing)
                         [Reject] -> End

      Exception 2: Discrepancy during Matching (step 4)
          - AP Clerk emails Purchasing -> Purchasing tries to resolve (contact supplier or request corrected invoice)
          - If resolved, then back to Matching step? 
          - If not resolved, escalate to Rita (AP Supervisor) -> 
                Rita contacts supplier or coordinates -> 
                    [Resolved] -> back to Matching step?
                    [Cannot resolve] -> reject? 

      Exception 3: Manager finds issue during approval.
          - Reject or ask to hold -> then what? 
                Carlos says: "I might reject it or ask Mary to hold it and investigate further"
                Then Mary might involve Purchasing or Rita? 

          We can model: 
              [Manager finds issue] -> 
                  Reject -> End? (But then the invoice is not paid? Or goes back to the beginning?) 
                  Or send back to AP Clerk for investigation -> which might lead to the discrepancy resolution path? 

  Given the complexity, we'll create a textual model that captures the main flow and the exceptions.

  Proposed BPMN-like textual model:

  ===========================================
  Process: Invoice Approval

  Participants:
    - Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk (Mary)
    - Purchasing Officer (Dan)
    - Department Manager (Carlos)
    - AP Supervisor (Rita)
    - Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) [indirectly]

  Data Objects:
    - Invoice
    - Purchase Order (PO)

  Main Flow:

  1. Start: Invoice Received (by email)
     Role: AP Clerk
     Task: Receive Invoice

  2. Check for PO Number
     Role: AP Clerk
     Decision:
        - If PO is present: Proceed to "Log Invoice and Forward to Purchasing".
        - If PO is missing: 
             a. (Common path) Send back to supplier requesting details -> End (for this invoice until resubmitted).
             b. (Exception path) If the invoice is for informal services, escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita) for handling.

  3. Log Invoice and Forward to Purchasing
     Role: AP Clerk
     Task: Log invoice into accounting system and forward to Purchasing Officer.

  4. Confirm Receipt of Goods and Validate Details
     Role: Purchasing Officer
     Task: Confirm that the goods/services were received and validate invoice details (quantities, prices) against PO.
     Note: This step may involve contacting the supplier if needed? But typically, they check internally.

  5. Match Invoice against PO in System
     Role: AP Clerk
     Task: Perform matching in the accounting system.
     Decision:
        - If matches: Proceed to "Send to Manager for Approval".
        - If discrepancy: Proceed to "Resolve Discrepancy".

  6. Send to Manager for Approval
     Role: AP Clerk
     Task: Send the invoice (via system) to the Department Manager.

  7. Manager Approval
     Role: Department Manager
     Task: Review invoice, PO, and confirmation. Approve if correct.
     Decision:
        - If approved: Proceed to "Schedule Payment".
        - If not approved (due to issues): Proceed to "Investigate Manager's Concerns".

  8. Schedule Payment
     Role: AP Clerk
     Task: Schedule the invoice for payment in the next payment run.
     End: Invoice paid.

  Exception Paths:

  Exception Path A: Handling Missing PO (from step 2)
      - When PO is missing and the invoice is for informal services:
          Task: AP Supervisor (Rita) works with department heads to decide:
                Option: Create retrospective PO -> then go to step 3 (Log Invoice and Forward to Purchasing).
                Option: Reject invoice -> End.

  Exception Path B: Resolve Discrepancy (from step 5)
      - Step B1: AP Clerk emails Purchasing Officer to clarify.
      - Step B2: Purchasing Officer attempts to resolve:
             - Contact supplier directly or through Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) to get corrected invoice or clarification.
             - If resolved: Go back to step 5 (Match Invoice against PO).
             - If not resolved within a set time or after attempts: Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita).
      - Step B3: AP Supervisor (Rita) intervenes:
             - Contacts supplier, coordinates between departments, or decides to create a retrospective PO if applicable.
             - If resolved: Go back to step 5.
             - If not resolved: Reject invoice -> End.

  Exception Path C: Investigate Manager's Concerns (from step 7)
      - Step C1: Department Manager rejects or asks to hold the invoice and investigate.
      - Step C2: AP Clerk (Mary) investigates (which may involve Purchasing Officer or AP Supervisor) -> This might lead to the discrepancy resolution path (Exception Path B) or a new resolution.
      - After investigation:
             - If resolved: Go back to step 7 (Manager Approval) or step 6? We'll go back to step 6 (Send to Manager for Approval).
             - If not resolved: Reject -> End.

  Additional Notes:
    - The Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is involved in Exception Path B when Purchasing or AP Supervisor contacts her to resolve with the supplier.
    - The AP Supervisor (Rita) handles complex exceptions and also the missing PO for informal services.

  Ambiguities:
    - The exact nature of the "Match Invoice against PO" step (step 5) is unclear because Purchasing already validated the details. It might be a system step that is automated, but Mary describes it as something she does. We have modeled it as a manual/system task by the AP Clerk.
    - The process for handling goods not received is not described. We assume that invoices are only sent after goods are received, so the Purchasing step (step 4) only confirms receipt and validates details.

  ===========================================

  This model captures the main flow and the key exceptions. It is structured so that a BPMN diagram can be drawn.

  We'll now write the structured textual representation.

### **Ambiguities & Variations**  
- **PO Validation:**  
  - Purchasing validates receipt *and* details (per Dan), but AP Clerk performs system matching afterward (per Mary). Inconsistency noted; modeled as sequential checks.  
- **Supplier Contact:**  
  - Purchasing may contact suppliers directly (Dan) or via Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).  
- **Escalation Timing:**  
  - Discrepancies loop back to Purchasing first (Step 4) before escalating to AP Supervisor.  
- **System Triggers:**  
  - Manager approval is system-initiated after matching (automatic email).
