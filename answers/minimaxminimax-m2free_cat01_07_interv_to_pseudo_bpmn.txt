I’m working on producing a textual description that can convert into a BPMN diagram. I need to clarify this process, which could be tricky. It might include elements like a "Start" event for receiving an email invoice, followed by tasks such as "Check PO presence," "Log invoice," and "Forward to Purchasing for GRN." I also need to define gateways to check for missing or incorrect details, along with role swim lanes: Accounts Payable (AP), Purchasing, Department Manager, AP Supervisor, and Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM).

I'm focusing on generating a textual BPMN process model for the invoice approval process. This will include essential elements like the start event (Receiving Invoice), tasks, gateways, roles, and exceptions. I want to cover variations such as "invoice without PO," "service invoices with retrospective PO," and issues like "pricing discrepancies." I’ll define swim lanes for Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, AP Supervisor, and Supplier Relationship Manager. In the AP lane, the first step is checking for a valid PO number, as Mary emphasized.

I'm diving into the specific tasks for the Accounts Payable (AP) process. Mary suggests emailing the supplier to request more details if there's no PO. Dan mentions that if a PO number is missing, he instructs Mary to get that information. This creates a bit of ambiguity about the exact sequence of actions. I think we can summarize both actions in the model. The next step is logging the invoice into the system, which only happens if there's a PO. If no PO exists, we'll escalate to the Supervisor or create a retrospective PO for service invoices.

I'm laying out a clearer sequence for the Accounts Payable (AP) process. The steps include: 1) Log invoice in system, 2) Forward to Purchasing for confirmation, 3) Perform three-way match, and then decide if there's a match. If everything checks out, a manager approval request is sent. In case of discrepancies, I'll create tasks like "Escalate discrepancy to Purchasing," which leads to various options for resolution. If the issue can’t be resolved, we might escalate to the Supervisor. Additionally, I need to include checks for missing PO numbers since Mary always looks for a valid one at the start.

I'm organizing the entire invoice approval process into clear swim lanes, with roles for AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, AP Supervisor, and Supplier Relationship Manager. Each lane will have specific tasks, like validating PO presence and performing the three-way match, and I'll include gateways for decision points. I’ll make sure to cover exceptions like creating retrospective POs and the interactions between roles. Ultimately, I aim to create a concise textual BPMN model that captures all these details, including payment scheduling and variations for service invoices.

I'm working on a structured textual BPMN for the invoice approval process, including key steps, flow, and roles. Starting with the event for invoice arrival, I’ll set up gateways for checking PO presence and three-way matching. Each lane will specify tasks assigned to roles like AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, and Department Manager. I'll also note exceptions and any ambiguities, ensuring clarity while also considering variations like “Informal services.” The final output will be neatly formatted with headings and bullet points for readability.

# BPMN-like textual process model: Invoice Approval (Three-Way Match + Exception Handling)

## Overview
- Trigger: Invoice received (typically by email).
- Primary objective: Approve valid invoices and schedule payment; resolve discrepancies; escalate non-resolvable issues.
- Main roles: AP Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), AP Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen), Supplier (external).
- Notable artifacts: Invoice (email PDF), Purchase Order (PO), Receiving Confirmation/Goods Receipt Note (GRN), Matching Results, Confirmation Emails, Payment Schedule.

## Process Flow (textual, high level)

1. Invoice Arrives (Start)
   - Start event: Invoice received in AP inbox.

2. Validate PO presence (Gate 1: PO Present?)
   - Yes (PO present): Proceed to “Log invoice in system.”
   - No (PO missing):
     - AP requests PO from supplier.
     - If supplier provides PO  continue.
     - If supplier cannot provide PO (or PO is invalid):
       - Escalate to AP Supervisor.
       - AP Supervisor decides:
         - Create retrospective PO (for service/contracted cases) or
         - Reject invoice.

3. Log Invoice in System (AP Clerk)
   - Record invoice details and link to PO.

4. Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation (AP Clerk)
   - Send invoice and PO to Purchasing for receipt confirmation and accuracy check.

5. Purchasing Review and Response (Purchasing Officer)
   - Compare invoice line items with PO.
   - If discrepancy identified:
     - Options:
       - Ask AP to hold invoice; wait for supplier to issue a corrected invoice.
       - Directly contact supplier for correction.
       - Escalate to AP Supervisor for coordination or to Supplier Relationship Manager for contract/price verification.
       - If issue is complex and unresolved  escalate to AP Supervisor.
     - Supplier may issue a revised invoice  return to Step 2 (validate PO presence) or Step 5 as appropriate.
   - If everything matches (quantities, prices, charges):
     - Send confirmation back to AP Clerk.

6. Perform Three-Way Match (AP Clerk)
   - Match invoice quantities and prices to PO and receiving confirmation.
   - Gate 2: Three-way Match OK?
     - Yes: Trigger manager approval.
     - No: Escalate to AP Supervisor for resolution.

7. Manager Approval Request (AP Clerk / System)
   - System sends automatic approval request email to Department Manager, including invoice, PO, and purchasing confirmation.

8. Manager Review and Decision (Department Manager)
   - Review invoice vs PO and confirmation; note budget and policy rules.
   - Gate 3: Manager Acceptable?
     - Yes: Approve in system  proceed to payment scheduling.
     - No:
       - Request AP to hold and investigate.
       - May escalate to AP Supervisor; may consult Supplier Relationship Manager for contract terms.
       - If issue is corrected (revised invoice or clarification), return to Step 5 or Step 6 as appropriate.

9. Payment Scheduling (AP Clerk)
   - Add approved invoice to next payment cycle/run.

10. End
    - Payment scheduled.

## Participants (Swimlanes) and Responsibilities

- AP Clerk (Mary)
  - Validate PO presence.
  - Log invoice in system.
  - Forward invoice to Purchasing for confirmation.
  - Perform three-way match.
  - Trigger manager approval request.
  - Schedule payments.
  - Request missing PO from supplier.
  - Hold invoice when instructed and manage corrections.

- Purchasing Officer (Dan)
  - Review invoice against PO and receiving confirmation.
  - Confirm accuracy or identify discrepancies.
  - Contact AP or supplier to correct discrepancies.
  - Approve/confirm when all is correct.

- Department Manager (Carlos)
  - Review the invoice, PO, and confirmation.
  - Approve or reject; request investigations when needed.
  - Consider budget variance concerns.

- AP Supervisor (Rita)
  - Handle escalations when:
    - PO is missing/invalid and cannot be obtained.
    - Discrepancies cannot be resolved between AP and Purchasing.
    - Supplier cooperation is needed beyond routine.
  - Coordinate creation of retrospective POs for service/contracted cases (with department heads).
  - Decide rejection when resolution fails.
  - Ensure exceptions do not stall indefinitely.

- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
  - Participate on discrepancy cases involving contract terms/pricing.
  - Contact suppliers to provide missing PO, correct pricing, or issue revised invoices.

- Supplier (External)
  - Respond to requests for PO, corrected invoices, and clarifications.

## Artifacts / Data Objects

- Invoice (PDF or attachment received via email)
- Purchase Order (PO)
- Goods Receipt/Receiving Confirmation
- Matching Results (system output from three-way match)
- Confirmation Email (Purchasing to AP)
- Approval Email/Notification (system to Manager)
- Retrospective PO (created by AP Supervisor for services)

## Exceptions / Variations

- Missing PO
  - AP requests PO from supplier.
  - If supplier cannot provide  AP Supervisor either creates a retrospective PO (for services/contracts) or rejects the invoice.

- Discrepancies detected (pricing, quantities, charges)
  - Purchasing (and/or Supplier Relationship Manager) coordinates correction with supplier.
  - Supplier issues revised invoice; process returns to validation or match steps.
  - If correction fails or is delayed  escalate to AP Supervisor; may reject if non-resolvable.

- Service/contracted invoices without a PO
  - AP Supervisor works with department heads to create a retrospective PO; once created, process returns to normal flow.

- Manager rejects or flags for investigation
  - Invoice is placed on hold; AP investigates and may loop in Purchasing or Supplier Relationship Manager.
  - Once resolved, process resumes at match or purchasing confirmation as appropriate.

- Edge cases noted by stakeholders
  - Interviewees suggest that a manager “approval” may only occur after both PO confirmation and invoice-PO match. This model enforces a match check prior to manager approval to ensure logical consistency; ambiguity remains in scenarios where a match might be skipped in special cases.

## Consolidated Notes

- Sequence flow consistency: The model ensures a match check occurs prior to manager approval; discrepancies at any stage trigger exception handling via Purchasing and/or AP Supervisor, and potentially Supplier Relationship Manager.
- Acceptance criteria: Valid invoice has an associated PO, positive purchasing confirmation, and a successful three-way match before manager approval and payment scheduling.
- Handling delays: Escalation to AP Supervisor prevents indefinite stalls; revised invoices re-enter the process at the appropriate validation or matching step.

This textual model captures the typical path, roles, artifacts, gateways/decision points, and exception flows. It can be directly mapped into BPMN 2.0 using Start/End events, Tasks (User/Send/Service), Exclusive Gateways, parallel flows where appropriate, and message flows to external suppliers.
