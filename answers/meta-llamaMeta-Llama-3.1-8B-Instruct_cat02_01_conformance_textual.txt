After analyzing the event log and the normative process description, I have identified cases that deviate from the intended process flow.

**Case Violations:**

1. **Case 2**: This case deviates from the normative process in several ways. The sequence starts with "Receive order" (correct), then "Check inventory" (correct), but then it proceeds to "Package items" (incorrect) before "Authorize payment." This is a clear violation of the constraint that "Authorize payment" should occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging. Additionally, after the payment is authorized, it skips the packaging step altogether, proceeding directly to shipping, which is also incorrect.

2. **Case 3**: This case has a significant deviation. It starts correctly with "Receive order" and "Check inventory." However, after checking inventory, it authorizes payment, which, while not directly against any rule based on the timing alone, is slightly out of sequence in terms of logic since it does not reflect an inventory check resulting in sufficiency. Nonetheless, the critical deviation is what follows: after authorizing payment, it proceeds to "Cancel order," which is the correct next step if inventory is insufficient. However, the case then proceeds to "Ship order," which directly violates the rule that "Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.

3. **Case 4**: This case has a clear deviation from the normative process. It starts correctly with "Receive order" and "Check inventory." However, instead of checking inventory first and then proceeding to either fulfillment or cancellation appropriately, it goes directly to "Cancel order" without any indication of inventory insufficiency. This cancels out the purpose of inventory checks and prematurely skips to cancellation, followed by "Close order," which, although correctly ending the process, suggests that this process might not have the standard flow given the cancellation without preceding inventory check issues.

4. **Case 5**: This case appears to follow the normative process up to "Ship order," but since it does not involve a cancellation step after checking inventory, it does not have the standard fulfillment flow either. However, the key point here is not about the fulfillment but about shipping after "Authorize payment" without "Package items," which violates the constraint that "Ship order" should only occur after packaging.

**Interpretation and Explanation of Violations:**

1. **Cases 2 and 5**: Both cases indicate an incorrect sequence where "Authorize payment" precedes "Package items," which contradicts the normative process. This suggests a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the necessity of payment authorization following inventory checks.

2. **Cases 2, 3, and 5**: All these cases deviate from the correct sequence of activities, particularly in how they transition between payment authorization, packaging, and shipping, or in Case 3, after cancellation. These deviations suggest either a misinterpretation of the process or a misunderstanding of the logical sequence that should follow an inventory check.

3. **Cases 3 and 4**: Both of these cases illustrate the confusion or misinterpretation around the cancellation step. They proceed to shipping or prematurely close the order without ensuring that inventory checks or the logical sequence of steps are respected, suggesting an incomplete understanding of when to cancel an order and how to correctly finalize it afterward.

4. **Case 4**: This case also highlights a confusion or misinterpretation of when to cancel an order. It cancels without adequately addressing the inventory check, which is a critical step in determining whether to proceed with fulfillment or cancellation.

**Conclusion:**

The identified cases highlight deviations from the normative process, primarily due to misinterpretations of the sequence of activities, particularly around payment authorization, packaging, shipping, and the handling of cancellation steps. These deviations indicate a need for clarification or refinement in the process description to ensure that all possible scenarios are covered and that the logical sequence of steps is clearly understood.
