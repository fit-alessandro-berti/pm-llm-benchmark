1) How do variations in supplier lead times across countries influence safety stock levels and overall working capital, and what trade-offs exist between buffer inventory and service levels?
2) In what ways can multi-tier supplier visibility (beyond tier-1) reduce risk related to component shortages, geopolitical events, or single points of failure?
3) How can we quantify and prioritize the impact of quality metrics from each supplier on downstream yield, rework costs, and warranty claims?
4) What decision framework should guide the mix between air and sea freight given demand volatility, carbon targets, cost constraints, and product launch timelines?
5) How can we improve forecast accuracy for high-variance markets without overfitting to short-term trends or compromising responsiveness to market signals?
6) What strategies can harmonize contractual terms (e.g., Incoterms, payment terms, penalties) across suppliers to balance flexibility with risk transfer?
7) How might dual-sourcing or nearshoring certain components affect resilience, total landed cost, and compliance exposure?
8) What governance model best coordinates R&D design changes with procurement and manufacturing to minimize engineering change order (ECO) disruptions?
9) How can predictive maintenance and real-time OEE monitoring in the assembly plant reduce downtime while aligning with labor regulations and shift constraints?
10) What is the optimal inventory positioning across suppliers, the Malaysia assembly plant, regional DCs, and local warehouses to minimize stockouts and obsolescence?
11) How can we integrate carbon accounting into planning (e.g., choosing suppliers, transport modes, packaging) without undermining cost or service KPIs?
12) What data quality and master data management practices are needed to ensure accurate planning across currencies, time zones, and regulatory regimes?
13) How should we design an early-warning system for recalls, leveraging field failure data, warranty claims, and in-factory test results to shorten detection-to-correction time?
14) What scenario-planning capabilities are required to stress test disruptions (e.g., port closures, export controls, pandemics) and predefine mitigation playbooks?
15) How can machine learning models for demand forecasting and allocation be governed to avoid bias, ensure explainability, and enable rapid override when needed?
16) What is the ROI of advanced automation (e.g., robotics, AI inspection) versus flexible human labor in a product line with frequent model updates?
17) How can we align incentives across internal teams (R&D, procurement, manufacturing, logistics, sales) and external partners to reduce the bullwhip effect?
18) What cybersecurity and data-sharing protocols are necessary for collaborating with logistics partners and suppliers while protecting IP and customer data?
19) How do we balance just-in-time replenishment for fast-moving markets with the financial and operational risks of demand spikes or transport bottlenecks?
20) What continuous improvement framework (e.g., Lean, Six Sigma, Theory of Constraints) best fits this multi-echelon, multinational network, and how will we measure sustained gains?
