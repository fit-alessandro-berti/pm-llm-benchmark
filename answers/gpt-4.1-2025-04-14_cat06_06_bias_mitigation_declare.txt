Certainly! Here is the **updated `declare_model`** with constraints designed to mitigate bias related to sensitive attributes (e.g., `ApplicantRace`) in a loan application process. **New activities** introduced for bias mitigation include: `ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, and sensitive attribute checks such as `CheckApplicantRace`. 

I have **inserted constraints** to ensure:
- A `ManualReview` co-occurs with any final decision on minority applicants.
- No direct succession from a sensitive attribute disclosure to a `Reject` or `Approve` decision—`BiasMitigationCheck` must intervene.
- A succession constraint enforces that sensitive applicant decisions are always preceded by a check or mitigation step.

## Rationale for Constraints

### 1. **Coexistence Constraints**
- **`Approve_Minority`/`Reject_Minority` with `ManualReview`**:  
  Ensures all decisions affecting minority applicants have a human/manual review step, avoiding purely automatic (potentially biased) decisions.

### 2. **Response/Succession Constraints**
- **`CheckApplicantRace`  `BiasMitigationCheck`**:  
  Any time a sensitive attribute is checked, a bias mitigation activity must follow, making implicit bias handling explicit in the process.
- **`BiasMitigationCheck`  `FinalDecision`**:  
  Ensures a fairness-oriented check always happens before any final decision.
- **`BiasMitigationCheck` precedes minority decisions** (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`):  
  No approval/rejection for minority applicants without passing through a bias check.
- **`ManualReview` directly precedes minority decisions**:  
  All decisions about minority applicants are gated by a manual review step.

### 3. **Non-succession/Non-chain-succession Constraints**
- **Prevent direct transition from `CheckApplicantRace` to decision**:  
  A `Reject_Minority` or `Approve_Minority` cannot immediately follow or be directly chained after seeing an applicant’s race; fairness checks must intervene.

## **Summary of Bias Mitigation**

These constraints:
- Block immediate, unchecked decisions based on sensitive attributes.
- Require fairness activities (`BiasMitigationCheck`, `ManualReview`) before making any final determination about minority applicants.
- Mandate the presence of these fairness activities in any case where the applicant’s sensitive information could affect outcomes.

**This increases transparency, enforces checks and balances, and makes biased process flows traceable and correctable.**
