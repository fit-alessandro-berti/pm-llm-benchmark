The process underlying this data involves multiple stages in the approval and payment of declarations. The flow can be summarized as follows:

1. An employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The declaration is EITHER approved by the administration (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION) OR rejected by the administration (Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION) and sent back to the employee.
3. If the declaration is approved by the administration, it is EITHER forwarded to the budget owner for approval (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER) OR directly sent to the supervisor for final approval (Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
4. If the budget owner approves the declaration, it is sent to the supervisor for final approval (Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
5. If the administration rejects the declaration, it may be resubmitted by the employee (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION), or it may be rejected by the budget owner and sent back to the employee (Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER).
6. Declarations can also be approved by a pre-approver (Declaration APPROVED by PRE\_ASSIGN). If so, the declaration is either sent to the supervisor for final approval (Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR) or it is rejected by the supervisor and sent back to the pre-approver (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR).
7. If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it may be resubmitted by the employee (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE).
8. After the final approval by the supervisor, the request for payment is made (Request Payment).
9. Payment is handled after the request payment stage (Payment Handled).
10. At various stages, some declarations are rejected by missing or unspecified roles (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by MISSING).

Throughout the process, there are various frequencies and performance values associated with each stage, which likely represent the number of times each step occurs and the total performance time, respectively.
