 The process described by the data provided appears to be a workflow for handling expense declarations within an organization. The process involves multiple stages of approval, rejection, and resubmission, ultimately leading to payment processing. Here is a step-by-step description of the typical workflow, along with variations that occur due to rejections and resubmissions:

1. **Declaration Saved by Employee**: An employee starts by creating a declaration but may save it for later submission.

2. **Declaration Submitted by Employee**: The employee officially submits the declaration for approval.

3. **Declaration Approved by Administration**: The submitted declaration is reviewed and potentially approved by the administration department.

4. **Declaration Approved by Budget Owner**: In some cases, after the administration's approval, the declaration must also be approved by the budget owner.

5. **Declaration Approved by Pre-Approver**: In another variation, the declaration might be reviewed by a pre-approver before moving forward.

6. **Declaration Final Approved by Supervisor**: The declaration receives its final approval from a supervisor. This step can be reached from different paths, depending on who approved the declaration earlier (administration, budget owner, or pre-approver).

7. **Request Payment**: Once the declaration is finally approved, a request for payment is initiated.

8. **Payment Handled**: The payment is processed and handled by the finance department or equivalent.

9. **Rejection and Resubmission**: At various stages, the declaration can be rejected. The reasons for rejection include missing information, budget constraints, or other issues. When a declaration is rejected:
   - The employee is notified and can either save the declaration (for future edits) or resubmit it after making necessary corrections.
   - The employee must then go through the approval process again, starting with the party that initially rejected the declaration.
   - In some cases, the declaration goes through multiple cycles of rejection and resubmission. Each cycle increases the number of times the declaration is submitted and potentially the time taken for final approval.

10. **Rejection by Missing**: There are instances where the declaration is rejected by an unspecified party labeled as "MISSING." This could indicate an error in the process or an overlooked step that requires clarification.
