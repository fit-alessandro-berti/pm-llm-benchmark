 The process described by the data involves the submission and approval of declarations (likely expense reports or similar documents) within an organization. The process includes various stakeholders who review and approve the declarations at different stages. Here's a breakdown of the process flow, including the different roles and possible outcomes:

1. **Declaration Submitted by Employee**: The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration.

2. **Declaration Approved by Administration**: The declaration is first reviewed and potentially approved by the administration department.

3. **Declaration Approved by Budget Owner**: In some cases, after the administration's approval, the declaration is sent to a budget owner for an additional level of approval.

4. **Declaration Approved by Pre-Approver**: In another variant, the declaration may be reviewed by a pre-approver before moving forward.

5. **Declaration Final Approved by Supervisor**: Once the declaration has passed through the necessary approval steps, it requires final approval from a supervisor.

6. **Request Payment**: After all approvals are obtained, a request is made to handle the payment.

7. **Payment Handled**: The payment is processed and handled, marking the end of a successful process flow.

8. **Declaration Rejected**: At various stages, the declaration can be rejected. The rejection can occur by the administration, supervisor, budget owner, or pre-approver. If rejected, the process flow includes the following steps:
   - **Declaration Rejected by Employee**: The employee may reject the declaration post-administration review, pre-approver review, budget owner review, or supervisor review. This typically leads to the employee resubmitting the declaration after making necessary changes.
   - **Declaration Rejected by Missing**: There is an anomaly with a "Declaration Rejected by Missing" step, which is likely an error or a placeholder for an unspecified rejection reason or role.

9. **Declaration Saved by Employee**: An employee can save a declaration without submitting it, which is recorded as a process variant but does not lead to payment handling.

10. **Iterative Rejections and Submissions**: The data shows that declarations can go through multiple cycles of rejection and resubmission before finally being approved and paid. This includes scenarios where the declaration is rejected multiple times by the same or different roles.

11. **Performance and Frequency**: Each process variant is associated with a frequency (the number of times that variant occurred) and performance (which seems to be a monetary value associated with the declarations that went through that variant). The performance metric could represent the total value of all declarations processed in that variant.

The data also indicates that some declarations go through a more streamlined process (e.g., direct final approval by the supervisor without additional layers of approval), while others involve more complex and lengthy approval processes (e.g., multiple rejections and resubmissions).

In summary, the process is a multi-step approval workflow for handling declarations within an organization, with various checkpoints and the potential for iterative improvements based on feedback from different approvers. The presence of rejections and resubmissions suggests that there is a quality control mechanism in place to ensure that only valid declarations proceed to payment.
