To construct the process tree for the given complex hospital patient management scenario using the operators `->`, `X`, `+`, and `*`, we need to model the hierarchical and sequential nature of the activities as well as the decision points and loops.

Here is the process tree construction for the hospital patient management scenario:

1. Start with the root node which is the parallel operator (`+`) since there are multiple activities running concurrently at different stages.
2. Create a sequence (`->`) for the initial steps: Arrival (A) -> Registration (RG) -> Intake Assessment (IA).
3. Create a sequence (`->`) for the triage evaluation steps: Triage Interview (TI) -> Triage Classification (TC).
4. Use an exclusive choice (`X`) for the initial diagnostic test based on triage classification.
5. Create a loop (`*`) for the diagnostic review and treatment steps.
6. Within the loop, create a sequence (`->`) for the specialist consultation and exclusive choice for treatment.
7. Create another exclusive choice (`X`) for the re-diagnostic test.
8. After the loop ends, create a parallel operator (`+`) for the advanced imaging and nutritional counseling steps.
9. Create a sequence (`->`) for the final administrative and informational steps.
10. Finally, create a parallel operator (`+`) for the final administrative and financial clearances.

Here is the Python code to construct the process tree:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Initialize the root node with the parallel operator
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Create the initial sequence of activities
initial_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
A = ProcessTree(label="A", parent=initial_sequence)
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG", parent=initial_sequence)
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA", parent=initial_sequence)
initial_sequence.children.append(A)
initial_sequence.children.append(RG)
initial_sequence.children.append(IA)

# Create the triage sequence
triage_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
TI = ProcessTree(label="TI", parent=triage_sequence)
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC", parent=triage_sequence)
triage_sequence.children.append(TI)
triage_sequence.children.append(TC)

# Create the exclusive choice for the initial diagnostic test
diagnostic_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
CE = ProcessTree(label="CE", parent=diagnostic_choice)
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP", parent=diagnostic_choice)
diagnostic_choice.children.append(CE)
diagnostic_choice.children.append(FBP)

# Create the loop for the diagnostic review and treatment steps
review_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)
review_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=review_loop)
SC = ProcessTree(label="SC", parent=review_sequence)
treatment_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=review_sequence)
TM = ProcessTree(label="TM", parent=treatment_choice)
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT", parent=treatment_choice)
treatment_choice.children.append(TM)
treatment_choice.children.append(SPT)
RDT = ProcessTree(label="RDT", parent=review_sequence)
RDT_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=review_sequence)
FCE = ProcessTree(label="FCE", parent=RDT_choice)
FBA = ProcessTree(label="FBA", parent=RDT_choice)
RDT_choice.children.append(FCE)
RDT_choice.children.append(FBA)
review_sequence.children.append(SC)
review_sequence.children.append(treatment_choice)
review_sequence.children.append(RDT)
review_sequence.children.append(RDT_choice)
review_loop.children.append(review_sequence)

# Create the parallel operator for advanced imaging and nutritional counseling
advanced_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
AI = ProcessTree(label="AI", parent=advanced_parallel)
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC", parent=advanced_parallel)
advanced_parallel.children.append(AI)
advanced_parallel.children.append(NC)

# Create the final sequence of administrative and informational steps
final_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS", parent=final_sequence)
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI", parent=final_sequence)
final_sequence.children.append(FAS)
final_sequence.children.append(DDI)

# Create the parallel operator for the final administrative and financial clearances
final_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
BL = ProcessTree(label="BL", parent=final_parallel)
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP", parent=final_parallel)
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF", parent=final_parallel)
final_parallel.children.append(BL)
final_parallel.children.append(ICP)
final_parallel.children.append(MRF)

# Append all child nodes to the root node
root.children.append(initial_sequence)
root.children.append(triage_sequence)
root.children.append(diagnostic_choice)
root.children.append(review_loop)
root.children.append(advanced_parallel)
root.children.append(final_sequence)
root.children.append(final_parallel)

# The constructed process tree is now stored in the root variable
```

This code constructs a process tree that models all the described activities and their hierarchical and sequential relationships, including the loops and decision points.
