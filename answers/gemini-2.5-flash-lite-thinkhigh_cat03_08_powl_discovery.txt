The following POWL structure represents the manufacturing and distribution process described by the event log, incorporating activities, choices, loops, and partial ordering.

**1. Basic Activities (Transitions):**
These represent the individual steps in the process.

*   `OR`: Order Received
*   `MS`: Material Sourcing
*   `QS`: Quality Screening
*   `AS`: Assembly
*   `IQC`: In-line Quality Check
*   `TST`: Testing
*   `RT`: Re-Testing
*   `PK`: Packaging
*   `LB`: Labeling
*   `DP`: Distribution Planning
*   `D`: Dispatch

**2. Silent Activity:**
Used for optional paths that do not represent a process step.

*   `skip`: A silent transition, used when an optional step is skipped.

**3. Composite Operators:**

*   **Assembly and Quality Control Loop:**
    The log shows that `AS` (Assembly) can be followed by `IQC` (In-line Quality Check), and this sequence can repeat, sometimes with multiple `IQC` steps or re-assembly. The `*(A, B)` loop structure means executing `A`, then `B`, then `A` again. We model this as `*(AS, IQC)`. This represents a phase where an `AS` is performed, followed by an `IQC`. If the `IQC` does not lead to an exit from the loop, another `AS` is performed. This captures the "repeated if needed" nature of `IQC` in conjunction with `AS`.
    *   **Structure:** `*(AS, IQC)`

*   **Testing and Re-Testing Loop:**
    The log shows that `TST` (Testing) can be followed by `RT` (Re-Testing) if the product fails, with `RT` leading back to `TST`. The `*(TST, RT)` structure directly models this: `TST` is executed, then `RT` is executed, and if the loop is not exited, `TST` is executed again.
    *   **Structure:** `*(TST, RT)`

*   **Optional Labeling:**
    The `LB` (Labeling) activity is observed to be optional, appearing between `PK` (Packaging) and `DP` (Distribution Planning) in some cases, and skipped in others. This is modeled as an exclusive choice (`X`) between performing `LB` and skipping it (using a `skip` silent transition).
    *   **Structure:** `X(LB, skip)`

**4. Main Process Structure (StrictPartialOrder):**
The overall process is defined as a `StrictPartialOrder`, which lists all the components (activities and composite operators) and defines the sequential dependencies between them.

*   **Nodes:** The set of all components in the process:
    `{OR, MS, QS, *(AS, IQC), *(TST, RT), PK, X(LB, skip), DP, D}`

*   **Order (Edges):** The dependencies between these nodes:
    1.  `OR --> MS`: Order Received must be followed by Material Sourcing.
    2.  `MS --> QS`: Material Sourcing must be followed by Quality Screening.
    3.  `QS --> *(AS, IQC)`: Quality Screening must be followed by the Assembly and Quality Control phase.
    4.  `*(AS, IQC) --> *(TST, RT)`: The Assembly/Quality loop completes and leads to the Testing phase.
    5.  `*(TST, RT) --> PK`: The Testing loop completes and leads to Packaging.
    6.  `PK --> X(LB, skip)`: Packaging must be followed by the decision to Label or Skip Labeling.
    7.  `X(LB, skip) --> DP`: The Labeling decision leads to Distribution Planning.
    8.  `DP --> D`: Distribution Planning must be followed by Dispatch.

**POWL Structure Representation:**

The POWL model can be described as a `StrictPartialOrder` containing the following elements and relationships:

```
POWL_Model = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes = [
        Transition("OR"),
        Transition("MS"),
        Transition("QS"),
        OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition("AS"), Transition("IQC")]),
        OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition("TST"), Transition("RT")]),
        Transition("PK"),
        OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Transition("LB"), SilentTransition()]),
        Transition("DP"),
        Transition("D")
    ],
    order = {
        Transition("OR") --> Transition("MS"),
        Transition("MS") --> Transition("QS"),
        Transition("QS") --> OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition("AS"), Transition("IQC")]),
        OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition("AS"), Transition("IQC")]) --> OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition("TST"), Transition("RT")]),
        OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition("TST"), Transition("RT")]) --> Transition("PK"),
        Transition("PK") --> OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Transition("LB"), SilentTransition()]),
        OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Transition("LB"), SilentTransition()]) --> Transition("DP"),
        Transition("DP") --> Transition("D")
    }
)
```

This structure captures the primary sequential flow, the repetition in assembly/quality checks and testing, and the optional nature of labeling as observed in the provided event log data.
