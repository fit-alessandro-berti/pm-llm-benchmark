Below is an analysis divided into three parts: a description of the anomalies found in the model, some potential hypotheses behind these anomalies, and ideas for SQL queries to help verify whether these issues occur in the underlying data.


1. Anomalies Identified

• Inconsistent Ordering Between Evaluation and Closing  
– The model’s “noncoexistence” constraint prohibits having an “E” (Evaluate) event in the same trace as a “C” (Close) event. However, the intended process flow requires evaluation before approval and eventual closure. This contradiction undermines the business requirement that claims should be evaluated before closing.

• Misplaced Dependency Between Assign and Evaluate  
– The “responded_existence” constraint for “E” requires the presence of an “A” (Assign) activity. Although it is logical that a claim should be assigned before it is evaluated, the constraint’s formulation might inadvertently allow claims to be evaluated only if an assign event is recorded, potentially ignoring cases where adjustments might be made later in the workflow or if assignments are recorded inaccurately.

• Minimal Precedence Constraint on Closure  
– The “precedence” constraint only forces the “R” (Receive) activity to occur before the “C” (Close) activity. This does not enforce the full, intended order (which should include assignment, evaluation, approval, and notification) and may allow for skipping intermediate steps.


2. Hypotheses for the Anomalies

• Evolving Process Requirements  
– The business rules may have changed over time. Some constraints might reflect older policies (or misunderstood requirements) that conflict with the current intended process flow.

• Incomplete or Misinterpreted Requirements  
– There may have been a misinterpretation of business requirements during the process-modeling phase. For example, the “noncoexistence” rule might have been intended to enforce alternate conditions rather than outright exclusion of both evaluation and closure.

• Technical or Data Integration Issues  
– Data quality concerns or inconsistencies in recording events (e.g., missing assign and evaluation events) might have led to the formulation of less restrictive or incorrect constraints to “force” desired outcomes. This could also result from incremental changes in how events are logged.

• Pressure on Timeliness and Flexibility  
– Management pressure to expedite claim processing might have led to constraints that allow skipping certain steps. The constraints could be an accidental mix of rules designed both for optimized performance and validation, inadvertently introducing contradictions.


3. Proposed SQL Verification Approaches

To investigate whether these anomalies are reflected in the data, consider running SQL queries against your PostgreSQL tables:

• Verify Claims That Are Closed Without Evaluation  
This query identifies claims that have a “C” (Close) event but no corresponding “E” (Evaluate) event.

SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claim_events c
WHERE c.activity = 'C'
  AND c.claim_id NOT IN (
  SELECT ce.claim_id
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
);

• Identify Claims with Both Evaluation and Closure Events  
If the noncoexistence rule is being violated, this query finds claims that have both an “E” and a “C” event.

SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) > 0
   AND COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) > 0;

• Confirm Presence of Assignment Before Evaluation  
Examine if every evaluation (“E”) event is preceded by an assignment (“A”) event for the same claim.

SELECT DISTINCT e.claim_id
FROM claim_events e
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM claim_events a
  WHERE a.claim_id = e.claim_id
    AND a.activity = 'A'
);

These queries should help uncover deviations from the intended process flow and validate whether the constraints (and their anomalies) are actually affecting the execution of the claims process.


Conclusion

By examining the identified anomalies, considering the potential reasons behind them, and using targeted SQL queries to inspect the execution traces in the data, you can gain insights into whether the declared constraints are misaligned with business goals and whether adjustments to the process model or data practices are needed.
