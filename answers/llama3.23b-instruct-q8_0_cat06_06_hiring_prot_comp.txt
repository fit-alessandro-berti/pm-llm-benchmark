Based on the provided data, I've identified some key differences between the treatment of the "protected" group and the "unprotected" group:

1. **Registration Process**: The unprotected group has a more streamlined registration process, with fewer steps (e.g., Expert Examination is only included in 3 out of 14 variants). In contrast, the protected group requires multiple registrations before reaching the treatment stage.
2. **Variability in Performance**: The performance metrics for the unprotected group are generally higher than those for the protected group, indicating better treatment outcomes. This suggests that the unprotected group may have access to more resources or expertise, leading to improved health outcomes.
3. **Treatment Success Rates**: The unprotected group has a higher overall success rate (i.e., treatment successful) compared to the protected group, particularly in cases where there are multiple diagnoses or treatments involved.
4. **Discharge Processes**: The unprotected group has a more comprehensive discharge process, with more variants involving thorough examinations and additional diagnostic steps before treatment is completed.
5. **Variability in Discharge Times**: The protected group tends to have longer discharge times compared to the unprotected group, indicating that treatment may take longer for those in the protected group.

Some specific differences between individual process variants:

* Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (unprotected): 1466 cases with high performance metrics
* Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (protected): only 78 cases with lower performance metrics
* Discharge (unprotected): 505 cases with no treatment-related metrics
* Discharge (protected): 19 cases with low performance metrics

These differences suggest that the protected group may face barriers to timely and effective care, leading to longer treatment times and reduced success rates.
