**Addressing fairness and bias concerns**
</think>
The XOR branch in the model introduces a subtle advantage for applicants who undergo the “CheckLocalAffiliation” step (D). Only some applicants are routed to D, and the step is described as providing a “subtle score uplift.” This creates a hidden bonus that depends solely on whether someone happens to belong to the non-legally protected group—those with a local affiliation in a known community. Even if the uplift seems small, it tilts the process in favor of those individuals. The side effect is that an otherwise comparable applicant who is not part of that group is more likely to be routed through the skip branch. This applicant never receives that slight boost, so the loan outcomes can diverge for two applicants with identical financial profiles solely because one meets that informal criterion. The bias isn’t as explicit or large as a direct denial but still results in cumulative inequality: over many cases, the favored group accumulates a more positive scoring record and sees higher approval rates. Furthermore, because the uplift is tied to a factor unrelated to legitimate credit risk, the model’s predictions end up mixing creditworthiness signals with group identity. That undermines fairness and can make it harder to explain or defend decisions. Even though the privileged group is not legally protected, different regions or community affiliations can be proxies for socioeconomic status or race. This raises the risk of indirect or “disparate impact” discrimination and challenges any claim that the scoring process remains equitable across applicants.
