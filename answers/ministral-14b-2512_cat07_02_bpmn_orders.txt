The diagram is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) representation of an order-to-delivery process, divided into four main sections: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. Here's a detailed summary of each section:

### Sales
1. **Start Event (Monday morning)**
   - The process begins on a Monday morning.
2. **Check Order for Completeness**
   - The order is reviewed to ensure all necessary details are present.
3. **Check if Customer is Already in the Database**
   - The system checks if the customer exists in the database.
   - **If the customer is not in the database:**
     - The customer is added to the database.
   - **If the customer is in the database:**
     - Proceed to send order details.
4. **Send Order Details**
   - Order details are sent to the production and procurement departments.
5. **Draft Invoice**
   - An invoice is drafted and the process ends.

### Production
1. **Receive Order Details**
   - The production department receives the order details.
2. **Plan Production**
   - Production planning is carried out based on the order details.
3. **Check Material Availability**
   - The system checks if materials are available.
   - **If materials are faulty:**
     - The process loops back to procurement for material compensation.
   - **If materials are not faulty:**
     - Proceed to manufacture the product.
4. **Manufacture Product**

This BPMN diagram effectively outlines the workflow from receiving an order to delivering the product, including checks for completeness, customer database verification, production planning, material procurement, and product delivery.
