Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative rules and the desiderata for each case. Let me start by recalling the key points from Part 1 and Part 2.

**Normative Rules (Strict Rules):**
- The sequence must be: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case.
- Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment.
- Risk Assessment before Loan Decision.
- Inform Applicant after Loan Decision.
- If approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case. If rejected, no Finalize Documentation before closing.

**Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict):**
- Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received.
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision.
- Follow-up Call before closing (optional, not required).

Now, looking at the event log for each case.

**Case 1:**
- Timestamps: Application Received at 09:00, then Credit Check at 09:30, Risk Assessment at 10:00, Loan Decision at 11:00, Inform Applicant at 13:00, Finalize Documentation at 13:30, Close Case at 14:00.
- Let me check the sequence. All steps follow the correct order. Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, etc. Also, after Loan Decision, Inform Applicant is done, then Finalize Documentation (since it's approved), then Close Case. No issues here. Desiderata: Credit Check was within 30 minutes, so that's fine. Inform Applicant was 2 hours after decision, which is within 48 hours. No follow-up call, but that's not required. So Case 1 is compliant with all rules and desiderata.

**Case 2:**
- Application Received at 08:00, then Risk Assessment at 08:20 (no Credit Check yet). That's a violation of the normative rule that Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then Credit Check is done at 09:00, but the Risk Assessment was already done before. Also, the Loan Decision is Rejected, but then Finalize Documentation is done at 10:00, which is not allowed after rejection. So two normative violations here. The order is wrong (Risk before Credit), and Finalize Documentation after rejection. The desiderata aren't violated here since the main issues are normative.

**Case 3:**
- Application Received at 09:00. Credit Check at 14:00 (more than 24 hours later), which violates the desideratum. Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (approved), Inform Applicant at 16:00, which is 2 days after the decision (decision was at 14:00 on 14th, inform at 16:00 on 16th, that's 48 hours? Wait, the decision was on 14th at 12:00 (14:00 is 14:00, so 14th at 12:00? Wait, the event log says:

Wait, let me check the timestamps again for Case 3.

Case 3:
- Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00
- Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00 (two days later)
- Risk Assessment: 14:10? Wait, the event log says:

Looking back:

Case 3:
- Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00
- Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00 (so 2 days later, which is more than 24 hours, violating the desideratum)
- Risk Assessment: 2024-01-14 11:00
- Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00
- Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00 (which is 2 days after the decision, which is 48 hours? Let's see: decision was on 14th at 12:00. Inform is 16th at 15:00. So that's 2 days and 3 hours. The desideratum says within 48 hours, which is 2 days. So this is 2 days and 3 hours, which is beyond 48 hours. So that's a desideratum violation. Also, no follow-up call. But the normative rules are followed: sequence is correct. So Case 3 has desiderata issues but no normative violations.

So, summarizing:

**Normative Violations:**
- Case 2: Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and Finalize Documentation after rejection.
- Case 1: No violations.
- Case 3: No normative violations.

**Desiderata Violations:**
- Case 2: No desiderata issues (since those are not strict).
- Case 3: Credit Check was 2 days after application, which violates the 24-hour recommendation. Also, Inform Applicant was 2 days and 3 hours after decision, which is beyond the 48-hour recommendation. Also, no follow-up call, but that's not required.

So the answer should list which cases have normative violations, then which have desiderata issues.

Wait, but the desiderata are recommended but not strict. So for Case 3, the Credit Check was 2 days after application, which is a desideratum violation. Also, Inform Applicant was 2 days and 3 hours after the decision, which is beyond the 48-hour recommendation (which is 2 days). So that's a desideratum violation. Also, no follow-up call, but that's not a problem.

So, the task is to:

1. Identify which cases are violating the normative rules. That's Case 2.

2. Identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata. That's Case 3 (Credit Check delay, Inform Applicant delay, no follow-up). Case 2's issues are normative, not desiderata.

So, the answer should state:

1. Case 2 violates normative rules (Risk Assessment before Credit Check, Finalize Documentation after rejection). Case 3 has no normative violations.

2. Case 3 fails desiderata (Credit Check after 24h, Inform Applicant after 48h, no follow-up). Case 2's issues are normative, not desiderata.

Also, perhaps in the desiderata part, need to mention that even though the follow-up call is not required, it's recommended. So Case 3 didn't do it, but that's not a problem.

Wait, the problem says for desiderata, to identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata. So for Case 3, the Credit Check was more than 24 hours, which is a desideratum violation. Inform Applicant was 48 hours and 3 hours, which is beyond the 48-hour recommendation. So that's another desideratum violation. Also, no follow-up call. But the follow-up is not required, so that's not a violation. So the desiderata violations are the two timing issues.

So for the answer:

1. Normative violations: Case 2.

2. Desiderata violations: Case 3 (Credit Check delay, Inform delay).

Now, the user might want explanations and possible justifications. For example, Case 2's Risk Assessment before Credit Check could be a mistake, maybe a typo in the log? But the user says to explain the reasons. So for Case 2, the order is wrong, which is a normative violation. For Case 3, the desiderata are not met, but they are not strict.

So the final answer should list these points.

### **1. Normative Rule Violations**  
**Case 2** violates the strict sequence rules:  
- **Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment**, but the event log shows **Risk Assessment** (08:20) occurring **before Credit Check** (09:00). This violates the ordering rule.  
- **Finalize Documentation** is performed **after a rejection** (Loan Decision at 09:30, Finalize Documentation at 10:00). This is explicitly prohibited by the normative constraints.  

**Other Cases (1 and 3):**  
- **Case 1** adheres to all normative rules and sequence requirements.  
- **Case 3** follows the correct sequence and does not violate any normative constraints.  

---

### **2. Desiderata Violations**  
**Case 3** fails to meet the recommended best practices (desiderata):  
- **Credit Check delay**: The Credit Check occurs **2 days after Application Received** (14:00 on 2024-01-14 vs. 09:00 on 2024-01-12), violating the 24-hour recommendation.  
- **Inform Applicant delay**: The applicant is informed **2 days and 3 hours after the Loan Decision** (15:00 on 2024-01-16 vs. 12:00 on 2024-01-14), exceeding the 48-hour recommendation.  
- **No Follow-up Call**: While not strictly required, skipping the follow-up call is suboptimal behavior.  

**Other Cases (1 and 2):**  
- **Case 1** meets all desiderata (timely Credit Check, prompt Inform Applicant, and no follow-up call is optional).  
- **Case 2** does not violate desiderata, as its issues are strictly normative.  

---

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**  
- **Case 2**: The sequence errors (Risk Assessment before Credit Check and Finalize Documentation after rejection) are likely due to human error or system misconfiguration. These are critical violations of the process rules.  
- **Case 3**: The delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant may stem from resource constraints or prioritization of other tasks. While the desiderata are not strict, these delays could impact customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The absence of a follow-up call may reflect a lack of prioritization for this optional step.  

--- 

### **Summary**  
- **Normative Violations**: **Case 2** (sequence and documentation errors).  
- **Desiderata Violations**: **Case 3** (timed delays and missing follow-up).  
- **Case 1** fully complies with both normative rules and desiderata.
