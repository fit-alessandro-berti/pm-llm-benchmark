### **Justification for Naming Choices**

1. **Initiate_Request**
   - **Original Name:** `Initiate Request`
   - **New Names:**
     - `Initiate_Request_Online` (C001, C002): Indicates the request was initiated via an online portal.
     - `Initiate_Request_Branch` (C003): Indicates the request was initiated in person at a branch.
   - **Reasoning:** The context specifies whether the request was submitted online or in person, so the activity name reflects the channel.

2. **Verify_Documents**
   - **Original Name:** `Verify Documents`
   - **New Names:**
     - `Verify_Documents_Initial` (C001, C002): Represents the first document verification step.
     - `Verify_Documents_Final` (C001): Represents the final verification after additional documents are submitted.
     - `Verify_Documents_Physical` (C003): Indicates physical verification of documents at the branch.
     - `Verify_Documents_Post_Adjustment` (C003): Reflects verification after internal account adjustments.
   - **Reasoning:** The same activity occurs multiple times but serves different purposes depending on its position in the process and the context provided.

3. **Call_Customer**
   - **Original Name:** `Call Customer`
   - **New Names:**
     - `Call_Customer_Missing_Docs` (C001): Indicates the call was made to request missing documents.
     - `Call_Customer_Account_Discrepancy` (C002): Indicates the call was made to clarify discrepancies in the account.

     - `Call_Customer_Return_To_Branch` (C003): Indicates the call was made to ask the customer to return to the branch.
   - **Reasoning:** Each call has a distinct purpose, so the activity names reflect the specific reason for the interaction.

4. **Adjust_Account**
   - **Original Name:** `Adjust Account`
   - **New Name:** `Adjust_Account_Internal` (C002, C003)
   - **Reasoning:** This activity involves internal corrections to account details, so the name clarifies its scope.

5. **Approve_Request**
   - **Original Name:** `Approve Request`
   - **New Name:** No change needed.
   - **Reasoning:** This activity consistently represents the final approval step across all cases, so no renaming is necessary.
