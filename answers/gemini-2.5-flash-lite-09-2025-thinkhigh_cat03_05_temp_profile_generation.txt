The temporal profile dictionary below provides estimated averages and standard deviations (in seconds) for a representative selection of activity pairs within the high-tech electronics supply chain, accounting for delays across different process stages (procurement, manufacturing, logistics).

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # --- Procurement Phase Delays (Measured in Days/Weeks) ---
    ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 86400),      # SS -> OP: Selection finalized -> Order placed (Avg: 3 days, STDEV: 1 day)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1296000, 432000),    # OP -> RC: Order placed -> Components received (Avg: 15 days, STDEV: 5 days)

    # --- Manufacturing & Quality Control Delays (Measured in Hours) ---
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 14400),       # RC -> QI: Received -> Inspection starts (Avg: 1 day, STDEV: 4 hours)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (21600, 3600),        # QI -> CA: Inspection complete -> Assembly starts (Avg: 6 hours, STDEV: 1 hour)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (43200, 10800),       # CA -> PT: Assembly finished -> Testing begins (Avg: 12 hours, STDEV: 3 hours)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (1800, 300),          # PT -> PK: Testing passed -> Packaging starts (Avg: 30 minutes, STDEV: 5 minutes)

    # --- Logistics & Storage Delays (Measured in Days/Weeks) ---
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800),         # PK -> WS: Packaged -> Entered Storage (Avg: 1 hour, STDEV: 30 min)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (604800, 259200),     # WS -> DT: Released from storage -> Distribution shipment (Avg: 7 days, STDEV: 3 days)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000),    # DT -> AS: Distribution completed -> First Support interaction (Avg: 30 days, STDEV: 10 days)

    # --- Indirect/Longer Lags (Pairs separated by multiple activities) ---
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1555200, 302400),    # SS -> CA: From initial selection to start of assembly (Avg: ~18 days)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (68400, 18000),       # QI -> PK: From inspection to packaging (Avg: ~19 hours)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (864000, 345600),     # CA -> DT: From assembly start to distribution release (Avg: 10 days)
}
