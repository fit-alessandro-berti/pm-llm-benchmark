Based on the given event log, I'll analyze the sensitivity of attributes to ensure they do not violate fairness criteria.

1. **Activity**: Activity is already an attribute in itself and does not need any additional explanation. It remains a sensitive attribute as it can be used to infer demographic characteristics based on user actions such as hand-in job applications or application rejections.

2. **Case**: Case attributes have no direct impact on the fairness of the events, but they might indirectly affect fairness if there are specific cases that could lead to biases in certain contexts (e.g., "True" for affirmative action). However, considering all scenarios, case attributes remain neutral.

3. **Customer/User Information** (incomplete): Although not directly mentioned as an attribute, it can be inferred from the given log of user activities. It remains sensitive due to potential biases in handling customer information or demographic characteristics.

4. **Person**: The concept "person" is not explicitly presented here but could potentially lead to biases if the data collection system distinguishes between males and females based on attributes like gender. However, this attribute does not influence the current analysis of fairness sensitivity.

In conclusion:
- Activity remains a sensitive attribute due to its potential impact on demographic characteristics inferred from user actions.
- Case can be considered neutral but should be handled with caution when specific cases may lead to biases.
- Customer/User Information and Person attributes are potentially sensitive if not properly managed to avoid biased handling of customer information or demographic characteristics.
