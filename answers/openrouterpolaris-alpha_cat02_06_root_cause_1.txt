Short answer first, then details.

1. Cases with significantly longer resolution times

Let’s measure from “Receive Ticket” to “Close Ticket”:

- Case 101: 2h15m
- Case 103: 1h20m
- Case 102: ~25h10m
- Case 104: ~24h10m
- Case 105: ~49h05m

Short/normal: 101, 103  
Significantly delayed: 102, 104, 105 (especially 105)

2. Likely root causes of delays

Key patterns:

- a) Escalation to Level-2 and delayed follow-up:
  - Case 102:
    - Escalated at 11:30 on 2024-03-01
    - Level-2 “Investigate Issue” only at 14:00 (2.5h wait)
    - “Resolve Ticket” next day at 09:00 (overnight delay)
  - Case 105:
    - Escalated at 10:00 on 2024-03-01
    - Level-2 “Investigate Issue” only at 14:00 on 2024-03-02 (~28h wait)
    - Then “Resolve Ticket” at 09:00 on 2024-03-03 (additional ~19h wait)
  - Pattern:
    - Escalated tickets are not picked up promptly by Level-2.
    - Very long queues between “Escalate to Level-2” and “Investigate Issue” and between investigation and resolution.
    - Strong correlation: escalation  long idle times  long cycle times.

- b) Late start of initial investigation:
  - Case 104:
    - Assigned 09:30, but “Investigate Issue” starts only at 13:00 (3.5h wait)
    - Then no resolution until 08:00 next day (overnight).
  - Pattern:
    - Even without formal escalation, investigation is deferred, leading to aging tickets.
    - Idle periods after assignment suggest workload, prioritization, or handoff issues.

- c) Overnight / business-hours effects:
  - Cases 102, 104, 105 all span one or more nights.
  - Indicates that:
    - Work may pause at end of business day.
    - Tickets reaching critical steps (investigation/resolution) late in the day are pushed to next day.
  - This amplifies any queue or delay before key activities.

- d) Process inconsistency:
  - Fast cases (101, 103) show:
    - Quick triage
    - Immediate assignment
    - Investigation started soon after assignment
    - Resolution soon after investigation
  - Slow cases deviate from this: large gaps between these same steps.
  - So the core issue is not the process definition, but how consistently / promptly it is executed.

3. How these factors increase cycle time and what to do

How they cause delays:

- Escalation queues:
  - When Level-2 doesn’t pick up escalated tickets quickly, tickets sit idle.
  - Idle time between “Escalate” and “Investigate” dominates the total duration (especially in 105).

- Delayed investigation after assignment:
  - Long gaps between “Assign to Level-1 Agent” and “Investigate Issue” mean the ticket is technically “owned” but not worked on.
  - This pushes investigation into later hours, triggering overnight delays.

- End-of-day timing:
  - If triage/assignment/investigation happen late, and no after-hours coverage exists, tickets get stuck until the next day, compounding delays.

Recommendations (targeted and practical):

- 1) Tight SLAs around escalations:
  - Define a max allowed time between “Escalate to Level-2” and “Investigate Issue” (e.g., 1–2 hours).
  - Set up alerts for escalations breaching SLA.
  - Ensure clear ownership at Level-2 (queue monitoring or on-call rotation).

- 2) Enforce quick start of investigation after assignment:
  - Set a short SLA from “Assign to Level-1 Agent” to “Investigate Issue” (e.g., 30–60 min).
  - Use work queues and prioritization so newly assigned tickets are actively picked up, not parked.

- 3) Address end-of-day effects:
  - If 24/7 support isn’t possible, adjust:
    - Prioritization: escalate or start investigation earlier for tickets received later in the day.
    - Expectations: define different SLAs for tickets approaching closing hours.
  - If business impact is high, consider:
    - Partial after-hours coverage for escalated or aging tickets.

- 4) Monitor and manage bottlenecks:
  - Track:
    - Average waiting time between each step.
    - Separate metrics for escalated vs non-escalated tickets.
  - Focus improvement on:
    - Escalation handling
    - The handoff from assignment to investigation

- 5) Standardize best-case behavior:
  - Use cases 101 and 103 as benchmarks:
    - Rapid triage
    - Immediate assignment
    - Prompt investigation and resolution
  - Translate this into standard work instructions or automation rules.
