### Assumptions and Notes:
1. **Order Dispatched/Arrived for Order 1004**: Since there are no records for dispatch or arrival in the Delivery table for order 1004, I assumed it was either not dispatched or the records were missing. In a real scenario, you might need to investigate further or add a placeholder event.

2. **Items Picked for Order 1004**: Only one event for picking items was included since the order had only one line item with a single picking date.

3. **Order Dispatched/Arrived for Order 1003**: The order was dispatched and arrived as per the Delivery table, but the picking events were split into two separate events for clarity.

4. **Payment Events for Invoices**: Each invoice from the Invoice table was linked to its respective payment in the Payments table, ensuring chronological order.

5. **Resource/Actor**: Used the provided resource IDs to map to actual names and roles from the Resources table where available.

6. **Additional Attributes**: Included quantity for items picked and invoice amounts for clarity.

This event log should provide a comprehensive view of the order lifecycle for each case, suitable for process mining.
