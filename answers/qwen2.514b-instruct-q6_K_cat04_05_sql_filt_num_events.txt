To accomplish the task described in the draft prompt, you'll need to use a combination of window functions and common table expressions (CTEs) or subqueries within DuckDB SQL. Here's an example query that should work for your requirements:

```sql
WITH event_count AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as total_events
    FROM 
        event_log
)
SELECT 
    e.*
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    event_count ec 
ON 
    e.case_id = ec.case_id AND ec.total_events <= 6;
```

This query works in the following way:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `event_count`**: The CTE first calculates the total number of events for each `case_id`. This is done using a window function (`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`), which counts the rows grouped by `case_id`.
2. **Main Query**:
    - We join the original `event_log` table with the results of the CTE on `case_id`, ensuring we include only those cases where the total number of events (`total_events`) is less than or equal to six.

By using this query, you will filter out any cases containing more than six events and return all details for cases with up to six events.
