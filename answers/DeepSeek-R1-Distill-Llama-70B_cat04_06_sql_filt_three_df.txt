Alright, I'm trying to tackle this DuckDB SQL query problem. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, I need to identify cases where there's a specific sequence of activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed directly by 'Create Order', and then 'Confirm Order'. These three events must appear in this exact order without any other events interrupting them in the same case.

So, I think I'll need to use window functions to track the sequence within each case. Maybe using ROW_NUMBER() or RANK() to assign numbers based on the order of events. But I'm not entirely sure how to ensure the sequence is consecutive without any gaps.

Next, after identifying those cases, I need to check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. That means I have to calculate the difference between their timestamps and filter where it's greater than 5 days.

Once I have the cases that meet both the sequence and timing conditions, I need to exclude all their events from the final result. So, the final query should return all events except those from these excluded cases.

I'm a bit confused about how to structure the subquery to identify the problematic cases. Maybe I can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first find the cases that have the sequence and then check the timing. Then, in the main query, I can select all events where the case_id is not in that CTE.

Wait, but in DuckDB, does the ROW_NUMBER() function reset for each case? I think so, as long as I partition by case_id. So, I can assign a row number within each case based on the timestamp. Then, I can look for rows where activity1 is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', activity2 is 'Create Order', and activity3 is 'Confirm Order' in consecutive row numbers.

But I also need to make sure that these activities are exactly in that sequence without any other activities in between. So, for each case, I can check if there exists a trio of row numbers n, n+1, n+2 where the activities match the sequence.

Once I have those cases, I can then check the timing between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'. For each such trio, I can calculate the time difference and see if it's more than 5 days.

Then, collect all the case_ids that meet both conditions and exclude them in the final SELECT statement.

I'm also thinking about performance. Since event logs can be large, I need to make sure the query is efficient. Maybe using indexes on case_id and timestamp could help, but DuckDB automatically indexes columns used in WHERE and JOIN clauses, so that should be okay.

Putting it all together, I'll first create a CTE that assigns row numbers. Then, use that CTE to find the cases that have the specific sequence. From those cases, calculate the time difference and collect the case_ids where it's more than 5 days. Finally, select all events where case_id is not in that list.

Wait, but in the CTE, I might need to join rows to get the trio of activities. Maybe using a self-join on case_id and row numbers. For example, for each row with activity 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check if the next row in the same case is 'Create Order', and the one after is 'Confirm Order'.

Alternatively, I could use the LAG function to look back and see if the previous two activities match the required ones. That might be more efficient.

So, using LAG, for each row, I can check if the current activity is 'Confirm Order', the previous is 'Create Order', and the one before that is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. That way, I can identify the exact sequence.

Once I have those rows, I can extract the case_ids and then calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'. If it's more than 5 days, I add that case_id to the exclusion list.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, let me try to write the SQL step by step.

First, assign row numbers within each case:

WITH numbered_events AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as row_num
    FROM event_log
)

Then, use LAG to get the previous two activities:

cases_with_sequence AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM numbered_events
    WHERE activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order'
    AND LAG(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
)

Wait, but this would give me all 'Confirm Order' events that are preceded by the right sequence. But I need to find the case_ids where this sequence exists. So, I can collect distinct case_ids from this.

Then, from these case_ids, I need to calculate the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' for that specific sequence. So, for each case, I need to find the timestamps of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that exact sequence and compute the difference.

Hmm, maybe I can join the numbered_events table with itself to get the trio. For example:

cases_with_timing AS (
    SELECT c1.case_id
    FROM numbered_events c1
    JOIN numbered_events c2 ON c1.case_id = c2.case_id AND c1.row_num = c2.row_num - 1
    JOIN numbered_events c3 ON c1.case_id = c3.case_id AND c1.row_num = c3.row_num - 2
    WHERE c1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND c2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND c3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
)

This way, I get the case_ids where the activities are in the exact sequence. Then, I can calculate the time difference between c2.timestamp and c3.timestamp.

So, adding that to the query:

cases_with_timing AS (
    SELECT c2.case_id,
           (c3.timestamp - c2.timestamp) as time_diff
    FROM numbered_events c1
    JOIN numbered_events c2 ON c1.case_id = c2.case_id AND c1.row_num = c2.row_num - 1
    JOIN numbered_events c3 ON c1.case_id = c3.case_id AND c1.row_num = c3.row_num - 2
    WHERE c1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND c2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND c3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
)

Then, filter where time_diff > 5 days. But in DuckDB, how do I handle date differences? I think using DATE_DIFF with 'day' unit.

So, in the cases_with_timing CTE, I can compute the difference and then select case_ids where it's greater than 5.

final_excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM cases_with_timing
    WHERE time_diff > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

Putting it all together, the main query would select all events from event_log where case_id is not in final_excluded_cases.

But wait, do I need to consider multiple occurrences of the sequence within a case? For example, if a case has the sequence more than once, but only one of them has the time difference over 5 days, should I exclude the entire case? Yes, according to the problem statement, any case that has at least one such sequence with the timing condition should be excluded.

So, in the final_excluded_cases, I should collect distinct case_ids. Maybe using DISTINCT in the final_excluded_cases.

Putting it all together, the query would look like:

WITH numbered_events AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as row_num
    FROM event_log
),
cases_with_sequence AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT c2.case_id
    FROM numbered_events c1
    JOIN numbered_events c2 ON c1.case_id = c2.case_id AND c1.row_num = c2.row_num - 1
    JOIN numbered_events c3 ON c1.case_id = c3.case_id AND c1.row_num = c3.row_num - 2
    WHERE c1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND c2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND c3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
cases_with_timing AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM cases_with_sequence
    WHERE (SELECT (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)) FROM numbered_events ne
           WHERE ne.case_id = cases_with_sequence.case_id
           AND ne.activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
           AND ne.row_num IN (
               (SELECT row_num FROM numbered_events WHERE case_id = cases_with_sequence.case_id AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'),
               (SELECT row_num + 1 FROM numbered_events WHERE case_id = cases_with_sequence.case_id AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'),
               (SELECT row_num + 2 FROM numbered_events WHERE case_id = cases_with_sequence.case_id AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
           )) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the time difference directly in the cases_with_sequence CTE.

Alternatively, I can calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in the cases_with_sequence CTE.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the LAG function within the same CTE to get the timestamps of the previous activities.

Alternatively, I can modify the cases_with_sequence CTE to include the timestamps of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', then compute the difference.

So, revising the cases_with_sequence CTE:

cases_with_sequence AS (
    SELECT c3.case_id,
           c2.timestamp AS create_order_time,
           c3.timestamp AS confirm_order_time
    FROM numbered_events c1
    JOIN numbered_events c2 ON c1.case_id = c2.case_id AND c1.row_num = c2.row_num - 1
    JOIN numbered_events c3 ON c1.case_id = c3.case_id AND c1.row_num = c3.row_num - 2
    WHERE c1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND c2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND c3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
)

Then, in cases_with_timing, I can filter where confirm_order_time - create_order_time > 5 days.

cases_with_timing AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM cases_with_sequence
    WHERE confirm_order_time - create_order_time > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

Finally, exclude these case_ids from the main event_log.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM cases_with_timing
)

Putting it all together, the complete SQL query would include all these CTEs.

I think this should work. I've considered how to identify the sequence, calculate the time difference, and exclude the necessary cases. I'm a bit unsure about the exact syntax for date differences in DuckDB, but I think using DATE_DIFF or directly subtracting timestamps with INTERVAL should work.

I also need to ensure that the ROW_NUMBER() is correctly assigned based on the timestamp order within each case. This way, the activities are processed in the correct chronological order.

Another thing to note is that using DISTINCT in cases_with_sequence ensures that each case is only considered once, even if the sequence occurs multiple times. But according to the problem, if a case has at least one occurrence of the sequence with the timing condition, it should be excluded entirely.

I think I've covered all the points. Now, let me write the final SQL query incorporating all these steps.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to identify and exclude specific cases from an event log based on a sequence of activities and a timing condition. The goal is to return all events except those belonging to cases that meet the specified criteria.

### Approach
1. **Identify Sequence of Activities**: We need to identify cases where the activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' occur in exact succession without any intervening events.
2. **Check Timing Condition**: Among the cases identified, we further filter those where the time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. **Exclude Identified Cases**: Finally, we exclude all events from these identified cases from the final result set.

The approach involves using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into manageable steps:
1. Assign row numbers to events within each case to track their order.
2. Identify cases with the specific sequence of activities.
3. Calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' for these cases.
4. Exclude events from cases that meet the criteria.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH numbered_events AS (
    SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as row_num
    FROM event_log
),
cases_with_sequence AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT c3.case_id,
           c2.timestamp AS create_order_time,
           c3.timestamp AS confirm_order_time
    FROM numbered_events c1
    JOIN numbered_events c2 ON c1.case_id = c2.case_id AND c1.row_num = c2.row_num - 1
    JOIN numbered_events c3 ON c1.case_id = c3.case_id AND c1.row_num = c3.row_num - 2
    WHERE c1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND c2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND c3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
cases_with_timing AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM cases_with_sequence
    WHERE confirm_order_time - create_order_time > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_with_timing);
```

### Explanation
1. **CTE: numbered_events**: This CTE assigns a row number to each event within each case, ordered by the timestamp. This helps in tracking the sequence of events.
2. **CTE: cases_with_sequence**: This CTE identifies cases where the activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' occur in direct succession. It joins the numbered_events table to check the sequence and extracts the relevant timestamps.
3. **CTE: cases_with_timing**: This CTE filters the cases identified in the previous step to include only those where the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.
4. **Final Query**: The main query selects all events from the event_log table, excluding those from cases identified in cases_with_timing.

This approach efficiently narrows down the events to exclude based on the specified sequence and timing conditions, ensuring the final result contains only the relevant events.
