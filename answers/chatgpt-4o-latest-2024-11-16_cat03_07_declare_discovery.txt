Sure! Based on the process variants you provided and their frequency, I can mine a few likely DECLARE constraints. These constraints will be assumptions based on the behavioral patterns we can observe in the process variants—but feel free to customize them to match your actual business rules if I have missed some insights.

### Recognized Activities:
- `Create Fine`
- `Send Fine`
- `Insert Fine Notification`
- `Payment`
- `Add penalty`
- `Send for Credit Collection`
- `Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture`
- `Send Appeal to Prefecture`
- `Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture`
- `Notify Result Appeal to Offender`
- `Appeal to Judge`
    
The DECLARE constraints which can be learned from these variants might include the following:

### Constraints:

- **Existence Constraint**:
  - We observe that "Create Fine" seems to always occur in every variant. 
  - Similarly, "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Payment", and "Add penalty" appear with high support across different variants.

- **Absence Constraint**:
  - I don't see any activity that should never happen in any of the variants. Hence, no **absence** constraints will be added based on this data.

- **Exactly Once Constraint**:
  - In many cases, activities like "Create Fine" and "Send Fine" occur exactly once, but "Payment" sometimes occurs multiple times (especially in cases where penalties are added after multiple payments), so **Exactly Once** constraints can be placed on some (but not all) activities.

- **Responded Existence & Co-Existence**:
  - When "Send Fine" occurs, we usually see "Insert Fine Notification" and "Add penalty" following. This suggests a possible co-existence or responded existence constraint between these pairs.
  - Another candidate for co-existence is "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture" often together with "Send Appeal to Prefecture" and so on.

- **Response & Precedence**:
  - "Send Fine" seems to always respond to "Create Fine". 
  - "Insert Fine Notification" often responds to "Send Fine".
  - "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture" responds to "Add Penalty"
  - Similarly, a precedence may exist where "Add penalty" precedes "Send for Credit Collection" in many cases.

- **Succession Constraints**:
  - For activities like "Send Appeal to Prefecture" following the appeal insertion and "Notify Result Appeal to Offender", there might be succession constraints.
  - "Payment" generally follows "Add penalty" in many variants indicating a chain succession.

- **Non Co-Existence**:
  - There may be constraints like: "Payment" and "Credit Collection" do not co-exist (either due to full payment or submission to collections, but not both).

### Mapping the Constraints

Here is a Python dictionary representation of the DECLARE model for these constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Add penalty': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'absence': {},
    'exactly_one': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'coexistence': {
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'response': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'precedence': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Create Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Send Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Insert Fine Notification'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'succession': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Create Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'chainsuccession': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Credit Collection', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },
    'nonsuccession': {},
    'nonchainsuccession': {}
}
```

### Explanation of Key Patterns:
- **Existence**: Ensures that activities like "Create Fine", "Send Fine", etc., will always appear at least once in a trace.
- **Exactly Once**: Constraints like "Create Fine" and "Send Fine" should only appear once.
- **Initiation**: "Create Fine" always initiates the process.
- **Responded Existence**: For instance, if "Send Fine" occurred, "Insert Fine Notification" must occur eventually.
- **Co-existence**: "Add Penalty" and "Insert Fine Notification" often occur together.
- **Response & Precedence**: Activities should follow the correct order, e.g., "Send Fine" should happen before "Insert Fine Notification".
- **Succession**: Activities like "Add Penalty" should be followed by "Payment".
- **Chain Response**: Directly follows relation between key activities like "Add penalty" and "Payment".
- **Non-Co-existence**: "Credit Collection" and "Payment" do not co-exist in a trace.

### Final Thoughts:
This DECLARE model provides a general structure to describe your process flow based on the variants analyzed. You can further tweak the model to increase accuracy or remove overly generalized assumptions from the dataset. Let me know if you'd need any fine-tuning or adjustments!
