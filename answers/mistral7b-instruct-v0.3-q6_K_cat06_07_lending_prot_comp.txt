 The main differences between the protected group (consisting of 5 cases) and the unprotected group (consisting of several variants, totaling 2709 cases) can be observed in the following aspects:

1. Steps: The protected group consistently follows a specific sequence of steps from Request Appointment to Sign Loan Agreement or Loan Denied. However, in the unprotected group, there are more variants with different sequences and additional steps such as making multiple visits to assess collateral before submitting the file to underwrite.

2. Frequency: The protected group consists of fewer cases (5) compared to the unprotected group (2709 cases). This suggests that the application process in the protected group might be less complex or have stricter requirements, resulting in a lower number of applicants qualifying for it.

3. Outcomes: The protected group only shows two possible outcomes: Sign Loan Agreement and Loan Denied. In contrast, the unprotected group has more varied outcomes, such as applications being redirected to make additional visits to assess collateral before underwriting, which is not observed in the protected group.

4. Complexity: Based on the steps and outcomes, it appears that the application process for the protected group is simpler and less complex than that of the unprotected group, as evidenced by the fewer number of steps and limited possibilities for redirects or additional requirements.

5. Efficiency: The smaller number of steps and consistent outcome structure in the protected group may result in a more efficient application process, reducing the time and effort required for both the applicants and the lending institution. On the other hand, the unprotected group seems to have a more convoluted application process due to the additional steps and variability in outcomes, potentially leading to increased processing times and higher resource utilization.

6. Risk management: The protected group appears to have a more streamlined risk management approach as it focuses on essential steps and criteria for determining loan approval or rejection, while the unprotected group may involve a greater degree of evaluation and assessment, possibly indicative of a broader risk assessment strategy.
