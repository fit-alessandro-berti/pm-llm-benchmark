Here is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process. The estimates reflect realistic delays and variabilities in a complex high-tech electronics manufacturing context:

### Key Design Rationale

| Segment | Estimated Scale | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **SS  OP** | Hours–1 day | Internal decision and procurement paperwork |
| **OP  RC** | ~2 weeks | Supplier lead time for high-tech components |
| **RC  QI  CA** | Hours | On-site rapid turnaround once parts arrive |
| **CA  PT** | ~1 day | Complex electronics assembly and functional testing |
| **WS  DT** | ~5 days | Batch scheduling and logistics coordination |
| **DT  AS** | ~30 days | Post-sale warranty activation and support onset |

Standard deviations grow as pairs span more steps, reflecting **compounded uncertainty** across supplier variability, production schedules, and logistics delays.
