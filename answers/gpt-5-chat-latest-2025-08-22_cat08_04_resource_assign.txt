Great — let’s tackle this systematically. Below is a **comprehensive process-mining-driven approach** to understand TechSolve’s resource assignment inefficiencies and optimize them.

# **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **Metrics to capture**
Using the event log, I would analyze the following performance and behavior metrics by agent and tier (L1, L2, L3):

- **Workload Distribution**
  - Tickets handled per agent per shift/day/week.
  - Active handling time vs idle time.
  - Ticket category / priority distribution handled per agent.

- **Processing Times**
  - Average activity duration (e.g., "Work L1 Start–End").
  - Handling time vs waiting/queue time between activities.

- **First-Call Resolution / Escalation Rates**
  - Fraction of tickets resolved at L1 without escalation.
  - Ticket types most often escalated.

- **Reassignments**
  - Frequency of reassignments per ticket.
  - Time wasted between consecutive reassignments.
  - Which skills/categories produce most reassignments.

- **Skill Utilization**
  - Cases where tickets requiring high-specialization skills (DB, firewall, IAM) are worked on by generalist resources.
  - Cases where specialists perform “basic troubleshooting.”

### **Process Mining Techniques Applied**
- **Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs)**  
  Identify typical paths: Ticket Created  Assign L1  Work L1  Escalate  Assign L2  Work L2  Reassign, etc.  
  Helps visualize where assignments deviate.

- **Social Network / Handover-of-Work Analysis**  
  Resources connected if work on the same case consecutively. Reveals escalation patterns: e.g., if *Agent A02 frequently hands over to B08*  systematic L1  L2 skill escalation.

- **Role Discovery**
  Use clustering on activity/resource profiles:
  - Who usually resolves “Networking” vs “DB” issues.
  - Detect if tier roles differ in practice vs design.

- **Skill Utilization Analysis**
  Compare *required skill attribute* with *agent skill profile* actually assigned. Indicates underutilization/overuse of specialists.

### **Output**
We’d get a map of:
- Typical assignment paths.
- Who escalates to whom.
- Where resource usage diverges from intended skill-based routing.
- Quantification of misalignments in skill-task mapping.

# **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

With the above analysis, we can pinpoint possible trouble spots:

- **Skill Bottleneck**
  - Example: only 2 firewall experts (L2)  repeated queueing delays for P2 Network-Firewall tickets.
  - Quantify: “Avg. queue time for Networking-Firewall tickets = 2.5 hrs vs 45 min avg for others.”

- **Reassignment Delays**
  - Each reassignment adds average 30–45 min waiting.
  - “20% of P3 tickets breached SLA; 68% of those had 2 reassignments.”

- **Incorrect Initial Assignments**
  - Dispatcher assigns generalist  escalates (avoidable).  
  Quantify: % of tickets escalated within <30 min of start.

- **Uneven Load Across Agents**
  - Some L2s overloaded with escalated cases  queue builds.
  - Some L1s underutilized (low % of active handling time).

- **Impact on SLA**
  - Directly correlate SLA breaches with handovers and waiting time:
    - “Tickets with >=2 reassignments breached SLA 45% of the time; single-assignment tickets breached only 12%.”

# **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

Potential root causes include:

- **Assignment Rules**
  - Round-robin ignores skill match  misaligned assignments  escalations.

- **Skill Profile Accuracy**
  - Missing/incorrect agent skill tags  dispatch chooses wrong agent.

- **Ticket Categorization**
  - Required Skill not identified correctly in creation. L1 spends time diagnosing, then escalating.

- **Lack of Workload Visibility**
  - Dispatcher cannot see who is overloaded, so queue waits accumulate at “popular” agents.

- **L1 Training Issues**
  - L1 not empowered with scripts/tools, so they escalate even simple queries.

### Methods to Identify Causes
- **Variant Analysis**
  - Smooth tickets: Assigned  Resolved with 1 handover.
  - Problematic tickets: 2+ handovers, SLA breach.
  - Compare features: category, initial skill tag, dispatcher handling.

- **Decision Mining**
  - Learn from history which ticket attributes predict escalations or SLA breaches  discover flawed assignment rules.

# **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

Here are **three concrete, data-driven strategies** to fix assignment inefficiencies:

---

### **Strategy A: Implement Skill-Based Routing**
**Problem addressed:** Incorrect initial assignment, excessive escalations.  
**Approach:**
- Use ticket *Required Skill* + historical resolution data to assign directly to agents with needed skills.  
- If multiple agents qualified  assign based on workload (see Strategy B).  
**Data required:** Updated agent skill matrix, “Required Skill” attribute validation at logging.  
**Expected benefits:**
- Reduce unnecessary escalations by 40–60%.  
- Specialists focus only on matching tickets.  
- Faster time to resolution  higher SLA compliance.

---

### **Strategy B: Workload-Aware Dynamic Dispatcher**
**Problem addressed:** Overloaded vs underutilized agents.  
**Approach:**
- Dynamically allocate based on agent queue length, ongoing handling times, historical productivity.  
- Workload balancing algorithm: assign to least-loaded qualified agent.  
**Data required:** Real-time activity monitoring, assignment queue lengths.  
**Expected benefits:**
- Balanced utilization  improved morale.  
- Lower waiting time for specialist queues  improved SLA.

---

### **Strategy C: Predictive Assignment & Escalation Reduction**
**Problem addressed:** Poor initial categorization, L1 over-escalation.  
**Approach:**
- Train machine learning model using historical tickets  predict required skills at creation using category, notes, channel.  
- Guide L1/dispatcher with recommendations (e.g., “This looks like DB issue; route directly to SQL agent”).  
- Improve L1 empowerment with knowledge-based “first-call playbooks.”  
**Data required:** Event log with ticket text (categorization, notes), resolution path.  
**Expected benefits:**
- Increase first-call resolution.  
- Lower unnecessary L2/L3 involvement  senior resources freed up.  
- Reduced SLA breaches for mid-priority tickets.

---

### **Additional Option D (for flexibility): Dynamic Skill Pool Adjustment**
- Move cross-skilled resources temporarily between L1/L2 depending on surge (e.g., during firewall incident spikes).  
- Enabled by process-mining demand forecasting.  
- Increases resilience against sudden load spikes.

---

# **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

### **Simulation Before Implementation**
- Build **discrete-event simulation model** using mined process model + resource performance data:
  - Inputs: arrival patterns, SLA definitions, skill distributions, current assignment rules.
  - Simulate “what if” scenarios: skill-based routing, workload-balancing.
  - Compare KPIs: Average resolution time, SLA compliance, workload balance.

### **Implementation Plan**
- Pilot skill-based + workload-aware routing in one category (e.g., Network).
- Gradually expand after validated results.

### **Monitoring Post-Implementation**
Use process mining dashboards with **near-real-time monitoring**:

**KPIs to track:**
- % SLA compliance by priority (P2, P3 focus).  
- Average “time to start work” (queue waiting).  
- First-call resolution % (at L1).  
- Avg. # of reassignments per ticket.  
- Workload utilization (per agent, per skill pool).  
- Specialist utilization for matching vs non-matching tasks.  
- Escalation % per ticket category.

**Process Views:**
- Social handover network: expecting reduced L1L2 unnecessary flows.  
- Bottleneck lens: reduced queueing at specialists.  
- Variant analysis: % of single-pass smooth assignments should increase.  

Continuous monitoring ensures the improvements remain sustainable.

#  **Summary**

- **Step 1:** Use event log + process mining to analyze real resource behavior (workload distribution, skill use, reassignments).  
- **Step 2:** Diagnose issues  overloaded specialists, reassignments, skill mismatches, poor dispatcher rules.  
- **Step 3:** Root causes  round-robin, inaccurate skill records, poor ticket categorization, lack of visibility, L1 training.  
- **Step 4:** Strategies  **Skill-based routing**, **Dynamic workload-aware assignment**, **Predictive assignment & L1 empowerment** (optionally, dynamic reallocation of skills).  
- **Step 5:** Simulate before rollout; post-implementation monitoring on reassignments, SLA compliance, workload balance.

This approach transforms TechSolve’s IT service desk from a rule-of-thumb assignment system into a **data-driven, predictive, and balanced operation** with measurable SLA compliance gains.

Would you like me to also design a **sample dashboard mock-up (KPIs + process views)** that TechSolve management could use for ongoing monitoring, so they can *see* the before/after benefit?
