## A Process Mining-Based Approach to Transform Job Shop Operations

---

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### 1.1 Process Reconstruction and Flow Analysis

To reconstruct the actual job flows and task execution sequences, I would implement a multi-layered process mining approach:

**Event Log Preprocessing and Enhancement:**
- **Data Integration:** Merge MES event logs with supplementary data sources (quality records, maintenance logs, operator shift patterns) to create an enriched event stream
- **Case Notion Definition:** Establish dual case perspectives - job-level (JOB-XXXX) and resource-level (machine utilization patterns) to enable cross-dimensional analysis
- **Activity Abstraction:** Create hierarchical activity definitions distinguishing between value-adding activities (cutting, milling), non-value-adding (setup, queue waiting), and disruptions

**Process Discovery Techniques:**
- **Alpha++ Algorithm with Noise Handling:** Apply to discover the actual process model including parallel activities and loops, accounting for exceptional cases
- **Heuristic Mining:** Generate dependency graphs showing task precedence relationships and their frequencies, revealing dominant routing patterns versus exceptions
- **Inductive Visual Miner:** Create animated process flows showing job progression through the shop floor, highlighting congestion points and flow variations

### 1.2 Performance Metrics Extraction

**Job Flow Metrics:**
```
Flow Time = (Task_End_i - Task_Start_i) + (Queue_Time_i) + (Setup_Time_i)
Lead Time = Job_Completion - Job_Release
Makespan Distribution = Statistical distribution of Lead Times segmented by:
  - Job complexity (number of operations)
  - Priority level
  - Product family
```

**Queue Time Analysis:**
- Extract queue entry/exit events for each work center
- Calculate: `Queue_Time = Task_Start - Queue_Entry`
- Generate heat maps showing queue time variations by:
  - Time of day/week (identifying shift patterns)
  - Machine type (revealing systematic bottlenecks)
  - Preceding operation (uncovering flow dependencies)

**Resource Utilization Decomposition:**
```
Total Available Time = Shift_Hours × Working_Days
Productive Time = (Task_Actual_Duration)
Setup Time = (Setup_Actual_Duration)
Idle Time = Total_Available - Productive - Setup - Breakdown
Utilization Rate = (Productive + Setup) / Total_Available
Setup Ratio = Setup / (Productive + Setup)
```

**Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Quantification:**

Create a setup time matrix S[i,j] where:
- i = previous job type/characteristics
- j = current job type/characteristics
- S[i,j] = average setup duration when switching from type i to type j

Mining approach:
1. Extract all setup events with previous/current job attributes
2. Cluster jobs by similar characteristics (material, tooling requirements, dimensions)
3. Calculate statistical distributions for each transition type
4. Apply regression analysis to identify key drivers of setup duration

**Schedule Adherence and Tardiness Metrics:**
```
Tardiness = max(0, Actual_Completion - Due_Date)
Earliness = max(0, Due_Date - Actual_Completion)
Service Level = % jobs completed on time
Average Tardiness = (Tardiness) / Total_Jobs
Tardiness Variability = (Tardiness)
```

**Disruption Impact Quantification:**
- **Breakdown Analysis:**
  - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) per machine
  - Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) distributions
  - Cascading delay effects on downstream operations
  
- **Priority Change Impact:**
  - Frequency of hot job insertions
  - Average schedule displacement caused
  - Recovery time to baseline performance

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### 2.1 Bottleneck Identification and Impact Assessment

**Multi-Criteria Bottleneck Detection:**

1. **Utilization-Based Analysis:**
   - Identify resources with utilization > 85%
   - Calculate blocking probability using queuing theory models

2. **Flow-Based Analysis:**
   - Apply Critical Path Method to job networks
   - Identify resources appearing most frequently on critical paths
   - Calculate bottleneck shift patterns over time

3. **Waiting Time Analysis:**
   - Resources with highest average queue lengths
   - Resources with highest queue time variability

**Bottleneck Impact Quantification:**
```
Throughput Loss = (Theoretical_Capacity - Actual_Throughput)
WIP Accumulation Rate = d(WIP)/dt upstream of bottleneck
Propagation Delay = Time for bottleneck congestion to affect downstream
```

### 2.2 Task Prioritization Inefficiencies

**Variant Analysis Framework:**

Compare process variants for on-time versus late deliveries:
- **Routing Differences:** Identify if late jobs follow suboptimal routings
- **Resource Allocation:** Analyze if late jobs consistently receive lower-priority resource assignments
- **Queue Jumping:** Detect instances where lower-priority jobs bypass higher-priority ones

**Evidence Mining:**
- Calculate correlation between initial priority assignment and actual processing sequence
- Identify "priority inversions" where low-priority jobs delay high-priority ones
- Quantify the "urgency decay" - how job urgency increases as due date approaches versus proactive scheduling

### 2.3 Setup Time Optimization Failures

**Suboptimal Sequencing Detection:**

1. **Actual vs. Optimal Setup Time Comparison:**
   ```
   Setup_Inefficiency = Actual_Total_Setup - Optimal_Total_Setup
   where Optimal is calculated using TSP-like algorithms on historical data
   ```

2. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Identify periods where similar jobs were processed non-consecutively
   - Calculate potential setup time savings from better batching

3. **Machine-Specific Patterns:**
   - Identify machines with highest setup-to-processing ratios
   - Detect repetitive suboptimal sequences

### 2.4 Resource Starvation Patterns

**Starvation Event Mining:**
- Define starvation as: Idle_Time > threshold when upstream WIP exists
- Calculate starvation frequency and duration per resource
- Identify starvation cascades using process mining's causal analysis

**Coordination Failure Detection:**
- Analyze handoff delays between work centers
- Identify mismatched processing rates causing accumulation/starvation cycles
- Detect "feast or famine" patterns in resource loading

### 2.5 WIP Bullwhip Effect

**Variability Amplification Analysis:**
- Calculate coefficient of variation for WIP levels at each stage
- Apply spectral analysis to identify oscillation frequencies
- Correlate WIP variations with scheduling decision points

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### 3.1 Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules

**Evidence from Process Mining:**
- **Context Ignorance:** Show how FCFS/EDD rules ignore critical context like:
  - Current shop floor congestion state
  - Downstream resource availability
  - Setup optimization opportunities
  
- **Myopic Decision Making:**
  - Demonstrate how local optimization at work centers creates global suboptimality
  - Quantify the "greedy algorithm penalty" - performance loss from local decisions

### 3.2 Lack of Real-Time Visibility

**Information Lag Analysis:**
- Calculate average delay between event occurrence and system update
- Identify decisions made with outdated information
- Quantify the "information staleness cost" - performance degradation from delayed updates

**Visibility Gaps:**
- Map information blind spots (unmeasured queues, unreported minor breakdowns)
- Calculate the "uncertainty tax" - excess buffers maintained due to poor visibility

### 3.3 Estimation Accuracy Issues

**Task Duration Prediction Errors:**
```
Prediction_Error = |Planned_Duration - Actual_Duration| / Planned_Duration
Mean_Absolute_Percentage_Error (MAPE) per operation type
```

**Factors Affecting Duration Variability:**
- Operator skill level effects (mine from operator ID patterns)
- Job complexity factors (material type, tolerances, batch size)
- Time-of-day effects (fatigue, shift changes)
- Machine condition effects (performance degradation over time)

### 3.4 Setup Time Management Failures

**Root Causes Identified Through Mining:**
1. **No Setup Forecasting:** Current system doesn't anticipate setup requirements
2. **No Sequence Optimization:** Jobs scheduled without considering setup dependencies
3. **Missing Setup Data:** Some setup times not tracked or averaged inappropriately

### 3.5 Disruption Response Inadequacies

**Reactive vs. Proactive Analysis:**
- Calculate "disruption recovery time" - time to return to baseline performance
- Identify lack of contingency planning through variant analysis of breakdown responses
- Quantify "disruption propagation distance" - how far disruptions affect the schedule

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Multi-Factor Dynamic Dispatching with Learning

**Core Logic:**

Replace static rules with a dynamic scoring function that adapts based on real-time shop floor state:

```
Priority_Score(job_i, machine_m, time_t) = 
    w1(t) × Urgency(job_i, t) +
    w2(t) × Setup_Efficiency(job_i, machine_m, previous_job) +
    w3(t) × Downstream_Impact(job_i, t) +
    w4(t) × Resource_Balance(machine_m, t) +
    w5(t) × Quality_Risk(job_i, machine_m)
```

Where weights w1...w5 are dynamically adjusted using reinforcement learning based on performance feedback.

**Component Definitions:**

- **Urgency:** `(Due_Date - Current_Time - Remaining_Processing_Time)^-2`
- **Setup_Efficiency:** `1 - (Setup_Time[prev,current] / max(Setup_Time))`
- **Downstream_Impact:** Probability that delaying this job will cause downstream bottlenecks
- **Resource_Balance:** Penalty for overloading already busy resources
- **Quality_Risk:** Historical defect probability for job-machine combinations

**Process Mining Integration:**
- Mine historical patterns to initialize weight parameters
- Extract setup time matrices S[i,j] from event logs
- Build downstream impact models from historical flow data
- Create quality risk profiles from quality inspection logs

**Expected Impact:**
- 30-40% reduction in average tardiness through better urgency management
- 15-20% reduction in total setup time through intelligent sequencing
- 20-25% improvement in bottleneck utilization through load balancing

### Strategy 2: Predictive-Reactive Scheduling with Digital Twin

)
```

**Phase 2: Cluster Formation**
- Apply DBSCAN clustering with similarity threshold
- Consider due date constraints in cluster formation
- Balance cluster sizes with machine capacity

**Phase 3: Sequence Optimization**
