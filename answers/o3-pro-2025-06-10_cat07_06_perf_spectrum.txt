What you are looking at is a time-line diagram that shows how individual traffic-fine cases move through three successive activities in the process.  

1. Horizontal axis  
   • Runs from 25 Jan 2000 (left) to 24 Apr 2013 (right).  
   • Every line you see is anchored on the dates at which the activities occurred for one particular case.  

2. Vertical axis (three discrete y-positions)  
   • Top:  “Send Fine”  
   • Middle: “Insert Fine Notification”  
   • Bottom: “Send for Credit Collection”  

3. Lines  
   • Each poly-line belongs to one case and simply connects the time-stamps of its activities from top to bottom.  
   • Grey lines: connections from “Send Fine”  “Insert Fine Notification”.  
     – They are almost vertical, meaning that as soon as a fine is sent the notification is inserted very quickly (typically within the same day).  
     – The density of these vertical grey strokes shows that this part of the process happens for almost every case and happens very fast.  
   • Pink / red lines: connections from “Insert Fine Notification”  “Send for Credit Collection”.  
     – Only a fraction of the cases drop down to this lowest activity, so the area below the middle line is much sparser.  
     – The fact that many of these lines are long and shallow indicates that it can take weeks, months or even years before a fine is handed over to credit collection.  
     – Different shades come from over-plotting; darker red segments mean several cases followed roughly the same timing.  

4. What the picture tells you about the process  
   • Volume: Thousands of fines are issued (the grey block is almost solid).  
   • Speed: Issuing the fine and inserting the notification is near-instantaneous.  
   • Escalation: Only a subset of fines (the red band) are escalated to credit collection, and when that happens the delay varies greatly—from very quick escalation (steep red segments) to very long delays that stretch across years (shallow red segments that span large parts of the horizontal axis).
