Okay, let's start by looking at the temporal profile model provided. The first thing I notice is the entry for ('R', 'P') which is Receive to Approve. The average time is about 25 hours, but the standard deviation is only 1 hour. That's really low compared to the average. That seems odd because if the process is taking a day on average, you'd expect some variation. Maybe approvals are being automatically scheduled or there's a script forcing approvals after exactly 25 hours, which isn't natural.

Next, the ('P', 'N') pair has an average of 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days. That's a long time between approving and notifying the customer. Why would it take so long? Maybe there's a backlog in sending notifications, or maybe some claims get stuck in a queue. Also, the high standard deviation means sometimes it's faster, sometimes much slower. Could be manual processes here causing delays.

Then there's ('A', 'C') with an average of 2 hours between Assign and Close. Closing a claim that quickly after assigning it seems too fast. Normally, you'd expect steps like Evaluate and Approve in between. Maybe some claims are being closed without proper evaluation? Or maybe they're duplicates or errors that are immediately closed.

The ('E', 'N') pair has a very short time of 5 minutes between Evaluate and Notify. That seems too fast for a human to handle. Maybe notifications are automated right after evaluation, but maybe some steps are being skipped. Or perhaps the Evaluate step is just a system check that triggers an automatic notification.

For hypotheses, the low standard deviation in R to P might be due to an automated process that schedules approvals rigidly, regardless of when evaluation happened. The long delay in P to N could be due to manual notifications that depend on staff availability, leading to bottlenecks. The quick A to C might indicate claims being closed without proper steps, possibly by certain adjusters or for specific claim types. The fast E to N could be an automated system but might bypass necessary approvals.

Now, for verification with SQL queries:

For R to P anomaly: Check claims where the time from Receive to Approve is exactly around 25 hours with little variation. Group by claim_type or adjuster to see if it's specific to certain cases.

For P to N delay: Find claims where Approve to Notify takes longer than average and see if they correlate with certain regions or adjusters with high workloads.

A to C quick closure: Look for claims closed shortly after assignment and check if those have any Evaluate or Approve events, which they shouldn't if they were closed prematurely.

E to N speed: Check if Notify happens right after Evaluate without Approve in between, which might indicate skipped steps.

Also, joining with adjusters and claims tables can help find patterns related to specialization or regions.

### Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **R  P (Receive  Approve)**
   - **Average:** ~25 hours
   - **STDEV:** 1 hour  
   *Anomaly:* Extremely low standard deviation relative to the average time suggests rigid timing inconsistent with typical human-driven approval processes.

2. **P  N (Approve  Notify)**
   - **Average:** 7 days  
   - **STDEV:** 2 days  
   *Anomaly:* Prolonged delay with high variability indicates potential systemic inefficiencies or inconsistent post-approval workflows.

3. **A  C (Assign  Close)**
   - **Average:** 2 hours  
   - **STDEV:** 1 hour  
   *Anomaly:* Claims closed unusually quickly after assignment, bypassing critical steps like evaluation or approval.

4. **E  N (Evaluate  Notify)**
   - **Average:** 5 minutes  
   - **STDEV:** 1 minute  
   *Anomaly:* Near-instant notification after evaluation may imply skipped validations or automation overriding manual checks.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R  P Rigid Timing**  
   Automated approval workflows may enforce fixed delays (e.g., batch processing) regardless of claim complexity, overriding manual review requirements.

2. **P  N Delays**  
   Manual notification processes could create bottlenecks (e.g., understaffed teams) or dependencies on external systems with unreliable SLAs.

3. **A  C Premature Closure**  
   Adjusters might close claims immediately after assignment due to invalid submissions (e.g., duplicates), system errors misclassifying claims, or pressure to meet KPIs.

4. **E  N Instant Transition**  
   Automated notifications triggered by evaluation completion may ignore mandatory post-evaluation steps (e.g., supervisor sign-off).

### Verification SQL Queries

#### 1. Identify Claims with Suspicious R  P Timing
```sql
WITH receive_approve_times AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 
        ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.adjuster_id,
    a.specialization,
    rt.duration_seconds
FROM receive_approve_times rt
JOIN claims c ON rt.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id -- Adjust join logic as needed
WHERE rt.duration_seconds BETWEEN 90000 - 3600 AND 90000 + 3600; -- ±1 STDEV from avg
```

#### 2. Investigate Prolonged P  N Delays
```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400 AS days_delay,
    c.claim_type,
    a.adjuster_id,
    a.region
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n 
    ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON p.resource = a.name -- Assuming resource maps to adjuster names
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 604800 + (2 * 172800); -- Exceeds avg + 2 STDEV
```

#### 3. Detect Claims Closed Without Evaluation/Approval
```sql
SELECT 
    ce_a.claim_id,
    ce_a.timestamp AS assign_time,
    ce_c.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp)) AS assign_to_close_seconds,
    CASE WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events 
        WHERE claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND activity IN ('E', 'P')
    ) THEN FALSE ELSE TRUE END AS missing_steps
FROM claim_events ce_a
JOIN claim_events ce_c 
    ON ce_a.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id AND ce_a.activity = 'A' AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp)) < 7200; -- Less than avg time
```

#### 4. Validate E  N Automation Bypassing Steps
```sql
SELECT 
    e.claim_id,
    e.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
    n.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS evaluate_to_notify_seconds,
    CASE WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events 
        WHERE claim_id = e.claim_id AND activity = 'P' 
        AND timestamp BETWEEN e.timestamp AND n.timestamp
    ) THEN FALSE ELSE TRUE END AS approval_missing
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n 
    ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 300 + (3 * 60); -- Below avg + 3 STDEV
