This image shows a business process diagram or workflow chart. It uses standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) symbols to illustrate a sequence of steps and decision points in a process. Here's a description of the key elements:

1. The process starts with a circular "Start" symbol on the left.

2. It then moves to a "register request" task.

3. After registration, the flow splits into multiple paths using diamond-shaped gateways (decision points).

4. Two parallel paths emerge: "examine thoroughly" and "examine casually".

5. These paths converge and lead to a "check ticket" task.

6. Following this, there's a "decide" task.

7. After the decision, the flow can take different routes:
   - One path leads to "reject request"
   - Another to "pay compensation"
   - A third option loops back to "reinitiate request"

8. The process ends with a circular "End" symbol on the right.

The diagram uses a combination of rectangles for tasks, diamonds for gateways/decision points, and arrows to show the flow direction. It represents a complex process with multiple decision points and potential outcomes, likely depicting some kind of request or claim handling procedure.
