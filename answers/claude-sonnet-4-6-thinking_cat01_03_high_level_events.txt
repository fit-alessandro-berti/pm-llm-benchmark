# High-Level Process Step Identification & Grouping

## Step 1: Analysis of the Raw Event Sequence

Before proposing groups, I mapped every low-level event to its functional role, resource type, and temporal position in the sequence. The pattern is identical across both cases (A1 and B2), confirming a stable, repeatable workflow.

```
#  | Timestamp (A1) | Activity                  | Role in Process
---|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------
1  | 08:00:05       | Retrieve raw metal sheet  | Material handling
2  | 08:00:07       | Scan barcode              | Identification/Tracking
3  | 08:00:10       | Place metal sheet on table| Material handling/Positioning
4  | 08:00:15       | Align metal sheet         | Material positioning
5  | 08:00:20       | Preheat metal sheet       | Material conditioning
6  | 08:01:00       | Pick up welding tool      | Assembly preparation
7  | 08:01:05       | Weld corner A             | Assembly/Fabrication
8  | 08:01:10       | Weld corner B             | Assembly/Fabrication
9  | 08:01:20       | Measure weld integrity    | In-process quality check
10 | 08:01:30       | Apply protective coating  | Surface finishing
11 | 08:01:45       | Dry coating               | Surface finishing
12 | 08:02:00       | Visual check              | Final quality assurance
```

## Step 2: Proposed High-Level Activities

### **High-Level Activity 1 — Material Preparation**

| Attribute        | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Covers Events**| Retrieve raw metal sheet  Scan barcode  Place metal sheet on table  Align metal sheet  Preheat metal sheet |
| **Resources**    | Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1 |
| **Time Span (A1)**| 08:00:05  08:00:20 (~15 seconds) |

**Rationale:**
These five events collectively bring the raw material from its storage state into a condition ready for manufacturing operations. They share a unified goal — *making the workpiece processable* — and exhibit three key grouping signals:

- **Logical cohesion:** Every event is a prerequisite for the next; you cannot weld an unpositioned, unidentified, cold sheet.
- **Temporal proximity:** All occur within a 15-second window with no interruptions.
- **Phase boundary:** The phase ends definitively when the material reaches target temperature (200°C), creating a clear handoff to the assembly stage.
- **Barcode scanning**, while performed by a human operator, is functionally part of preparation (traceability/identity confirmation before work begins), not a standalone process.

### **High-Level Activity 2 — Welding Assembly**

| Attribute        | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Covers Events**| Pick up welding tool  Weld corner A  Weld corner B |
| **Resources**    | Operator B |
| **Time Span (A1)**| 08:01:00  08:01:10 (~10 seconds) |

**Rationale:**
These three events represent the core fabrication/joining operation of the workflow. Grouping criteria:

- **Same resource, continuous execution:** All three events are performed exclusively by Operator B without interruption.
- **Tool pickup is inseparable from its use:** "Pick up welding tool" has no standalone value; it is purely preparatory to the immediately following weld operations. Separating it would create an artificial micro-stage.
- **Uniform action type:** Weld Corner A and Weld Corner B are repetitions of the same operation (WeldType: Spot) on different locations of the same workpiece — they are sub-steps of a single assembly action.
- **Distinct phase character:** This is the only phase where material transformation (joining) occurs.

### **High-Level Activity 3 — Weld Quality Inspection**

| Attribute        | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Covers Events**| Measure weld integrity |
| **Resources**    | Quality Sensor #1 |
| **Time Span (A1)**| 08:01:20 (~10 seconds after welding) |

**Rationale:**
Although this is a single low-level event, it warrants its own high-level stage for several reasons:

- **Distinct actor and purpose:** A dedicated quality sensor (not the welding operator) performs an automated measurement, signaling a deliberate process gate.
- **Decision point:** The integrity score (95 for A1, 93 for B2) represents a pass/fail checkpoint specifically tied to the preceding welding step. In a full log, failed checks here would presumably trigger rework — making this a branching point in the process.
- **Separation from final inspection:** This is an *in-process, operation-specific* check (verifying welds only), whereas the later visual check is a *final, holistic* product inspection. Collapsing them into one "Quality" step would obscure this important distinction.
- **Industry standard:** Inline weld integrity verification is a recognized, independent quality gate in ISO-compliant manufacturing processes.

---

### **High-Level Activity 4 — Surface Treatment**

| Attribute        | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Covers Events**| Apply protective coating  Dry coating |
| **Resources**    | Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2 |
| **Time Span (A1)**| 08:01:30  08:01:45 (~15 seconds) |

**Rationale:**
These two events form an inseparable chemical/physical process:

- **Sequential dependency:** Drying is meaningless without prior coating; coating is incomplete without drying. They represent a single treatment cycle (apply  cure).
- **Complementary resources:** Although different machines are used (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2), they collaborate on the same object transformation — applying and then fixing the polyurethane layer.
- **Temporal continuity:** The events occur back-to-back with no intervening steps.
- **Phase identity:** Together they constitute the entire "surface finishing" stage of the process, protecting the welded product from environmental degradation.

### **High-Level Activity 5 — Final Quality Inspection**

| Attribute        | Details |
|------------------|---------|
| **Covers Events**| Visual check |
| **Resources**    | Operator C |
| **Time Span (A1)**| 08:02:00 |

**Rationale:**
- **End-of-process gate:** This event occurs after all manufacturing and finishing steps are complete, making it structurally a final acceptance check before the product exits the process.
- **Holistic scope:** Unlike the weld-specific integrity measurement, a visual check assesses the overall condition of the finished product (coating quality, surface defects, dimensional conformance).
- **Human judgment:** The use of a human operator (Operator C) rather than an automated sensor reflects a deliberate design choice for comprehensive final verification.
- **Distinct resource class:** This is the only event performed by Operator C, who appears to be a dedicated QA role.

## Step 4: Enriched High-Level Event Log Output

Applying the grouping rules to both cases produces this aggregated event log:

```
CaseID | High-Level Activity         | Start Timestamp     | End Timestamp       | Resources Involved                          | Key Output/Outcome
-------|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------
A1     | Material Preparation        | 2024-03-01 08:00:05 | 2024-03-01 08:00:20 | Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1   | Sheet preheated to 200°C

B2     | Welding Assembly            | 2024-03-01 08:01:03 | 2024-03-01 08:01:12 | Operator B                                  | 2 spot welds completed
B2     | Weld Quality Inspection     | 2024-03-01 08:01:22 | 2024-03-01 08:01:22 | Quality Sensor #1                           | IntegrityScore: 93 (Pass)
B2     | Surface Treatment           | 2024-03-01 08:01:35 | 2024-03-01 08:01:50 | Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2            | Polyurethane coating applied & dried

```

## Step 5: Grouping Rules (Generalizable to Full Log)

These rules can be applied programmatically to the full event log:

| Rule | Condition |  Assign to High-Level Activity |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| R1 | Activity  {Retrieve, Scan barcode, Place, Align, Preheat} | **Material Preparation** |
| R2 | Activity  {Pick up [tool], Weld*} OR (Resource = Operator B AND preceding event is tool pickup) | **Welding Assembly** |
| R3 | Activity contains "integrity" OR Resource matches `Quality Sensor #*` AND follows welding | **Weld Quality Inspection** |
| R4 | Activity  {Apply coating, Dry coating} OR Resource matches `Coating Unit #*` or `Heating Unit #2` | **Surface Treatment** |
| R5 | Activity = "Visual check" AND position = last event in case sequence | **Final Quality Inspection** |

---

## Summary

The five high-level activities distill 12 low-level events into a clear, interpretable manufacturing workflow:

```
[Material Preparation]  [Welding Assembly]  [Weld Quality Inspection]  [Surface Treatment]  [Final Quality Inspection]
```

This abstraction preserves the two quality gates (inline weld check + final visual inspection) as distinct stages — a critical distinction for process monitoring, SLA tracking, and root-cause analysis — while collapsing purely mechanical sub-steps (e.g., tool pickup, individual welds) into coherent operational phases.
