Here’s what the visualization shows:

- Panel (a): Two interacting process models (“proclet classes”)
  - Left proclet: Lab visit
    - Steps: Order entry  Take blood sample  Receive result  Judge results.
    - Decision: If “Everything fine,” the case ends with Send report; otherwise Do tests again  Receive updated result  Send report.
    - Actors shown beside steps: doctor and lab assistants.
  - Right proclet: Lab test
    - Steps: Perform test  Make report  Finish lab test.
    - If a retest is requested: Perform test again  Provide updated report.
    - Actor: chemical analyst.
  - Communication
    - Two dashed rectangles depict channels connecting the proclets:
      - “Order system” (used to create a lab test from a lab visit).
      - “HIS” (Hospital Information System) used to send results and updated results back.
    - Numbered connectors (1.1, 1.2, …) mark individual message exchanges along these channels.
  - Start and end markers are black circles; flows are directed with arrows.

- Panel (b): A small class diagram
  - Classes: Lab visit and Lab test.
  - Relationship: A Lab visit requires one or more Lab tests (multiplicity 1..1 to 1..*).

- Panel (c): Example of a “performative” (a message instance)
  - Time: 11:00
  - Channel: Order system
  - Sender: Lab visit – John
  - Receiver: Lab test – HGB John
  - Action: Create
  - Content: Request to perform an HGB test for John
  - Scope: Private
  - Direction: OUT

Overall, the figure illustrates how a lab visit process orders and receives results from one or more lab test processes via two communication channels.
