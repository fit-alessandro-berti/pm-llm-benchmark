Based on the provided data, we can observe several differences between the process variants of the protected group (first) and the unprotected group (second) in terms of frequency and performance. Here are some main differences considering domain knowledge:

1. Difference in frequency of rejections:
* The protected group has a high frequency of rejections at the beginning of the process (1036 cases, performance = 270000.477) and after initial screening (793 cases, performance = 540011.977).
* The unprotected group also has high frequency of rejections (2490 cases, performance = 400004.640) right after the initial screening and a lower frequency after the extensive screening (1022 cases, performance = 480013.530).

2. Difference in performance (execution time) of the process variants:
* The protected group experiences longer performance for certain path variants:
	+ Extensive screening followed by multiple rent payments and tenant cancellation: 1349975.636 (for 11 cases)
	+ Extensive screening followed by multiple rent payments and eviction (due to missed rent payment): 990084.833 (for 6 cases)
* The unprotected group has shorter performance for a similar path variant:
	+ Sign contract, move in, pay rent multiple times and tenant cancellation: 1200034.536 (for 56 cases)

3. Difference in frequencies of signing contracts and making rent payments:
* The protected group has more cases with fewer rent payments before tenant cancellation:
	+ Sign contract, move in, pay rent 1-3 times, and tenant cancellation (10 cases)
	+ Sign contract, move in, pay rent 4-6 times, and tenant cancellation (23 cases)
* The unprotected group has more cases with multiple rent payments before tenant cancellation:
	+ Sign contract, move in, pay rent 1-4 times, and tenant cancellation (268 cases)
	+ Sign contract, move in, pay rent 5-6 times, and tenant cancellation (103 cases)

In summary, the main differences between the protected and unprotected groups are in the frequency of rejections, the performance of the process variants, and the frequencies of signing contracts and making rent payments. The protected group tends to have fewer cases
