Based on the normative process description and the provided event log, the following cases deviate from the intended process flow:

### Violating Cases and Explanations:

**1. Case 2**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
*   **Violation:** The "Package items" activity occurs before "Authorize payment".
*   **Explanation:** The normative process clearly states the expected sequence for sufficient inventory as: "Receive order" -> "Check inventory" -> "Authorize payment" -> "Package items" -> "Ship order" -> "Close order". A key constraint mentioned is that "'Authorize payment' should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging." In Case 2, "Package items" (Timestamp: 2023-10-06 10:00) is executed *before* "Authorize payment" (Timestamp: 2023-10-06 10:30). This reverses the prescribed order, implying items were prepared before payment was confirmed, which is a violation of the described workflow.

**2. Case 3**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order.
*   **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
*   **Explanation:** The normative process describes two main paths: one for sufficient inventory (involving payment authorization, packaging, and shipping) and one for insufficient inventory (involving cancellation). For insufficient inventory, the process should "directly proceed to 'Cancel order'," and "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping), and thus the next reasonable step is to 'Close order.'" The summary explicitly states: "'Ship order' should never after a cancellation." Case 3 shows the "Cancel order" activity occurring at 10:00, followed by "Ship order" at 10:30. This is a direct violation, as shipping activities are strictly prohibited after an order has been canceled. Additionally, the sequence of "Authorize payment" followed by "Cancel order" deviates from the distinct paths outlined; if inventory were insufficient (leading to cancellation), authorization should not have happened at all.

**3. Case 5**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
*   **Violation:** "Package items" activity is skipped between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".
*   **Explanation:** The normative process for sufficient inventory mandates a specific sequence: "...after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" This implies that packaging is a necessary intermediary step. In Case 5, "Ship order" (Timestamp: 2023-10-09 11:00) occurs immediately after "Authorize payment" (Timestamp: 2023-10-09 10:30), omitting the "Package items" step entirely. This violates the rule that items must be packaged *after* authorization and *before* shipping.

**Cases that do NOT violate the normative process:**

*   **Case 1:** Follows the complete normative sequence for sufficient inventory: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order.
*   **Case 4:** Follows the normative sequence for insufficient inventory: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order.
