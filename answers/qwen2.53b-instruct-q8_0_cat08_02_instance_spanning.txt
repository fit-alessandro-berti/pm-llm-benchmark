### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

#### Formal Identification and Quantification of Constraints

Using an event log analysis, we would first identify the constraints mentioned:

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:** This constraint is evident when orders requiring cold packing (TRUE) compete for limited specialized stations (e.g., Station S7). The impact can be quantified by measuring waiting times or throughputs at these stations.
  
- **Shipping Batches:** Orders destined for the same destination region are batched together. Waiting times for this process, along with how it affects individual orders' completion times, can be measured.

- **Priority Handling:** When an express order arrives and needs to use a shared station (e.g., Station C2), its processing time may affect standard orders using the same resource.
  
- **Hazardous Material Limits:** Orders containing hazardous materials must not exceed a certain limit of 10 at any step. Overloading these limits results in backlogs, delays, and potential non-compliance.

#### Specific Metrics

Metrics for quantifying these impacts would include:

- Waiting times (mean/median) due to resource contention.
- Throughput rates (average completion times).
- Batch formation times (batch size distribution, batch creation delay).
- Regulatory compliance checks (percentage of hazardous orders within limit at critical steps).

Differentiating between *within-instance* and *between-instance* constraints:
- **Within-instance:** Long durations for individual activities like picking or packing.
- **Between-instance:** Interactions with other orders using the same resource or waiting times due to batching, prioritization, regulatory limits.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

#### Potential Interactions Between Constraints

For example:

1. **Cold-Packing Stations and Batch Formation:**
   - Orders requiring cold packing may delay batch formation if they occupy a specialized station for longer than other orders.
   
2. **Express Order Prioritization and Hazardous Material Limits:**
   - Express orders might increase the number of hazardous material orders, causing regulatory limits to be more restrictive.

3. **Batch Formation with Priority Handling:**
   - Higher-priority orders (e.g., express) in batches may cause bottlenecks if they use resources that standard orders also need.

#### Importance for Optimization

Understanding these interactions is crucial because it helps us identify how one constraint affects another, enabling targeted interventions that can improve overall throughput and compliance. For instance, reducing the number of specialized stations could help alleviate cold-packing delays and thus speed up batch formation times.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

#### Proposed Strategies

1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations:**
   - **Addressing:** Shared cold packing stations.
   - **Changes:** Implement a dynamic queue management system where orders requiring cold packing are prioritized based on urgency and order type (e.g., express).
   - **Data/Analysis:** Predict resource demand by analyzing historical data to forecast which stations will be heavily used. Adjust the allocation dynamically to minimize delays.

2. **Revised Batching Logic:**
   - **Addressing:** Shipping batches.
   - **Changes:** Use dynamic batch formation triggered based on geographical regions and order types (e.g., express orders). This ensures that batch sizes do not exceed capacity limits at critical steps like cold packing or hazardous material checks.
   - **Data/Analysis:** Historical data analysis to predict common destination regions and batch sizes. Implement a system where batches form automatically once they reach predefined criteria.

3. **Improved Scheduling Rules:**
   - **Addressing:** Priority handling, regulatory compliance.
   - **Changes:** Develop scheduling rules that prioritize standard orders over express orders at critical steps (e.g., cold packing) but ensure compliance with hazardous material limits by dynamically adjusting the order of operations based on real-time data.
   - **Data/Analysis:** Real-time monitoring of resource usage and batch sizes. Use predictive analytics to anticipate potential bottlenecks, allowing for proactive adjustments.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

#### Simulation Techniques

To simulate these changes:

- **Process Mining Models:** Develop event logs that capture the dynamic nature of the fulfillment process with all constraints included.
- **Scenario Generation:** Generate various scenarios (e.g., different peak season loads, varied express order volumes) to test the impact of proposed strategies.
- **Data-driven Predictions:** Use historical data to predict resource demands and batch sizes. Simulate under these conditions to assess performance improvements.

#### Specific Aspects

In the simulation models:

1. **Resource Contention:** Model queue management for cold-packing stations.
2. **Batch Formation:** Track real-time batch creation based on geographical regions and order types.
3. **Priority Handling:** Simulate priority handling rules by dynamically adjusting batch sizes based on critical steps.
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure that hazardous material limits are not exceeded through predictive analytics of resource usage.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

#### Key Metrics and Dashboards

1. **Average Completion Times:** Track the mean completion times across different order types (standard vs. express) to ensure efficiency improvements.
2. **Resource Utilization Rates:** Monitor how resources like cold packing stations are used over time, ensuring they do not become bottlenecks.
3. **Batch Formation Delays:** Evaluate the frequency and duration of batch formation delays.
4. **Regulatory Compliance Violations:** Track whether hazardous material limits are being met (or exceeded) to ensure ongoing compliance.

#### Tracking Constraint Management

Specifically:

1. **Queue Lengths for Cold-Packing Stations:** Monitor waiting times at these stations before, during, and after implementing dynamic allocation policies.
2. **Batch Formation Delays:** Track the time between order arrival and batch formation completion.
3. **Hazardous Material Limits Compliance:** Regularly check that no more than 10 hazardous orders are processing simultaneously.

### Conclusion

The proposed strategies leverage process mining to identify, measure, and mitigate dependencies created by instance-spanning constraints. By dynamically allocating resources, rethinking batching logic, and improving scheduling rules, we can achieve more efficient order fulfillment processes while maintaining compliance with safety regulations. The simulation models will validate these improvements, ensuring that our changes effectively address the identified challenges. Post-implementation monitoring will ensure ongoing optimization efforts and compliance, delivering a sustainable solution to meeting delivery deadlines.
