Based on the provided attributes, the following can be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether a person is a citizen or not, which can be a sensitive attribute as it may relate to nationality, ethnicity, or immigration status.

2. `case:gender`: This attribute indicates the gender of a person, which is a protected attribute in many fairness regulations.

3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute may be related to the language spoken by a person, which can be an indicator of their nationality, ethnicity, or cultural background.

4. `case:private_insurance`: This attribute indicates whether a person has private insurance or not, which can be related to their socio-economic status.

5. `case:underlying_condition`: This attribute indicates whether a person has an underlying medical condition or not, which can be a sensitive attribute as it relates to health status.

These attributes can be considered sensitive as they relate to protected characteristics such as nationality, gender, ethnicity, language, socio-economic status, and health status. Fairness concerns may arise if the process outcomes (e.g., treatment success or discharge) are biased towards certain groups defined by these attributes. 

However, it's essential to note that the sensitivity of attributes can depend on the specific context and regulations of the problem domain. A thorough analysis of the problem domain and applicable regulations should be conducted to determine which attributes are sensitive for fairness.
