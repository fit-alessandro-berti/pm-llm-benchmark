**Answer:**

1. **Normative Rule Violations:**
   - **Case 2:** This case violates the normative rule because it skips performing a Credit Check before Risk Assessment. According to the sequence, a Credit Check must occur before a Risk Assessment can take place. The absence of a Credit Check before the Risk Assessment is invalid and requires rectification.

2. **Desiderata Violations:**
   - **Case 3:**  
     - *Credit Check Timing:* It took 4 days (from Application Received to Risk Assessment) for Case 3, which is more than 24 hours. This violates the desideratum of completing the Credit Check within a short window after the application is received.
     - *Inform Applicant Timing:* The decision was informed to the applicant only on day 16, which exceeds the recommended 48 hours after the loan decision. This also violates the desiderata for prompt communication.
     - *No Follow-up Call:* Case 3 does not include a follow-up call before closing, despite the recommendation to perform such a call.

**Justifications and Suggestions:**
- For **Case 3**, the timing and call deficiencies can be justified by:
  - *Technical Delays:* There might have been unforeseen technical issues causing delays in processing.
  - *Resource Allocation Issues:* The process could have been overburdened, leading to extended times for each step.
  - *Communication Error:* Perhaps there was a miscommunication about the timing expectations for feedback and follow-up.
- To improve future cases, adherence to strict sequencing and timeliness should be strictly enforced with clear communication of expected timelines to all involved parties. Additionally, implementing an efficient workflow management system could help mitigate delays and ensure adherence to both normative and desiderata standards more consistently.
