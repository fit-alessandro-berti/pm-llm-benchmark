Comparing the two event logs, it's evident that Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias, while Group A (Protected Group) does not. Here's how the bias manifests in Group B:

1. LocalResident attribute: All applicants in Group B are local residents (TRUE), while those in Group A are not (FALSE). This suggests a preference for local applicants in Group B.

2. CommunityGroup influence: In Group B, applicants associated with the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive preferential treatment:

   - They receive a "Community Boost" of +10 points to their preliminary score.
   - This boost is applied consistently for all applicants from this group.

3. ScoreAdjustment: Group B has a ScoreAdjustment column that's actively used:

   - Applicants from the Highland Civic Darts Club receive a +10 point adjustment.
   - This adjustment is not present in Group A's log.

4. Decision outcomes: The bias in Group B leads to systematic differences in final decisions:

   - In Group B, applicants with lower preliminary scores (e.g., U003 with 695) get approved after the community boost.
   - In Group A, decisions appear to be based solely on the preliminary score without adjustments.

5. Threshold differences: The bias in Group B seems to lower the approval threshold:

   - In Group A, a score of 710 leads to rejection (P002).
   - In Group B, a boosted score of 705 leads to approval (U003).

This bias in Group B systematically favors local residents and members of specific community groups, potentially leading to unfair advantages in the application process. Group A's log, in contrast, shows no such adjustments or preferential treatment based on residency or community group membership.
