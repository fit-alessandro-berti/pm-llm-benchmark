Based on the provided data, there are several key differences between patient flow and treatment outcomes at different types of hospitals:

1. **Variety of Diagnoses**:
   - Some patients have more than one visit leading to an examination step before discharge:
     - Diagnosis -> Treatment (2 times)
     - Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment (3 times)

   - Others follow a single diagnostic pathway immediately after registering:
     - Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment
     - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment

2. **Types of Exams**:
   - The use of `expert examination` vs. "thorough examination" seems to be more common for patients who might need a second opinion or detailed evaluation on the first step (604 visits vs 192 visits). Thorough examinations could indicate a more in-depth diagnostic process that doesn't necessarily imply a second visit if they're straightforward diagnoses.

3. **Follow-Up and Discharge**:
   - After treatment, some patients undergo another diagnosis step before discharge (e.g., Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Further Diagnose):
     - Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge
     - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis etc.

   - Patients tend to follow a straight path from examination and treatment to discharge much less frequently (e.g., Thorough Examination, Diagnosis), suggesting that if they need other tests after initial diagnosis, it's more common after multiple examinations rather than initially upon registering as is seen in the latter patient flow.

4. **Treatment Success/Failure**:
   - Treatment success rates vary significantly between ER and FD visits:
     - Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment (83%)
     - Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment (100%)

   The higher proportion of successful treatments for more complex procedures suggests that detailed examination often precedes the simpler, quicker care process.

5. **Length of Stay**:
   - Hospital ER seems to be associated with longer stays compared to FD departments since the discharges in ER are not followed by a second visit (40% vs 237%) or straightforward treatment.
   
In conclusion, the variety and detail-oriented nature of initial diagnostic steps are key differentiators between ER vs. outpatient visits. These observations suggest that there's more need for comprehensive testing within an Emergency Department compared to other settings like general primary care offices focused on shorter check-ups with simple diagnostics.

By focusing their initial evaluations broadly and allowing subsequent detailed examinations, they're better suited to managing complex diagnoses than simpler clinics in FD.
