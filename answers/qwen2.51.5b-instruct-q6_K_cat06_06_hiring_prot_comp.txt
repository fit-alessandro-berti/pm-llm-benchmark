To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we can analyze key factors such as process duration (execution time) and performance metrics for each process variant.

Here's a structured breakdown:

### Process Variants by Group

#### Protected Group:
- **Frequency**: 284
- **Performance**: 260001.236

| Process Variant | Frequency | Performance |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Register at ER    | 158      | 0           |
| Register at FD    | 156      | 0           |
| Expert Examination| 78       | 320020.038   |
| Thorough Examination| 41      | 220004.707   |
| Examination -> Diagnosis| 130    | 320003.346   |
| Examination->Thorough Examination| 25     | 219982.000   |
| Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful | 54      | 260010.907   |

#### Unprotected Group:
- **Frequency**: 1,466
- **Performance**: 320004.432

| Process Variant | Frequency | Performance |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Expert Examination| 1466     | 320004.432   |
| Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination | 192    | 220004.479   |

### Main Differences:

#### Execution Time:
- **Expert Examination**: Unprotected (frequency: 1,466) is significantly longer than protected group.
- **Thorough Examination**: Unprotected (frequency: 1,92) is comparable in duration to the expert examination process.

#### Performance Metrics:
- **Treatment Success Rate**:
  - Protected Group: Discharge after Treatment successful with performance 260001.236
  - Protected Group: Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (frequency = 41) -> Performance 219982.000
  - Unprotected Group: Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (performance 480007.484)

- **Treatment Failure Rate**:
  - Protected Group: Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge
  - Unprotected Group: Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge

#### Duration Analysis:
- **Thorough Examination**: Unprotected (frequency: 1,92) vs Protected (most common frequency)
  - Time difference: Thorough Examination takes longer.
  
### Domain Knowledge Interpretation:

1. **Duration of Expert Examination**:
   - The process variant "Expert Examination" is the most frequent for both groups but with different performance metrics and duration in protected group.

2. **Performance Across Different Processes**:
   - In unprotected group, expert examination has a higher treatment failure rate compared to protected group.
  
3. **Thorough Examination Comparison**:
   - The thorough examination process shows that it takes longer for the unprotected group (41) than the protected group's most frequent process (25).

### Conclusion:

The main unfair differences observed are in the duration of expert examinations and the treatment failure rates across different process variants, particularly between the protected group which tends to use shorter processes but with higher performance metrics compared to the longer thorough examination process used by the unprotected group.
