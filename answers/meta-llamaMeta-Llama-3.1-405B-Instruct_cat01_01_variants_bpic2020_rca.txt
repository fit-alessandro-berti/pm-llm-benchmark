Analyzing the given process variants and their performance metrics, several root causes for performance issues can be identified:

1. **High Rejection Rates**: Many process variants involve rejections at various stages (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, and BUDGET OWNER). These rejections lead to rework, which increases the overall process time and performance metrics. Reducing rejection rates through improved documentation, training, or process adjustments could significantly improve performance.

2. **Long Cycle Times for Rejected Declarations**: Process variants that include rejections show substantial increases in performance metrics (indicating longer cycle times or higher effort), especially when there are multiple rejection cycles (e.g., variants involving multiple rejections before final approval). This suggests that the handling of rejections and the re-submission process is inefficient.

3. **Serial Approval Process**: The process variants with multiple approvals in sequence (e.g., ADMINISTRATION -> BUDGET OWNER -> SUPERVISOR) show higher performance metrics, indicating that each approval step adds significant time or effort. Consideration of parallel approvals or streamlined decision-making processes might reduce overall cycle time.

4. **Manual Handling of Payments**: The variants that include "Request Payment -> Payment Handled" steps show increased performance metrics, suggesting that the payment handling process might be inefficient. Automation or streamlining of payment processes could potentially reduce cycle times and effort.

5. **Variants with Missing Information Leading to Rejection**: Variants indicating rejection due to "MISSING" information suggest that incomplete submissions might be a significant cause of rework and delay. Implementing more robust upfront checks or better documentation guidelines could help reduce these issues.

6. **Performance Impact of Different Approval Paths**: Significant performance differences are observed among variants with different approval paths (e.g., involving PRE_APPROVER vs. ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER). This suggests that some approval processes are more efficient than others. Identifying and adopting the most efficient approval paths across all process variants could improve overall performance.

7. **Impact of Declaration Being Saved but Not Submitted**: The variant "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" with zero performance metric may indicate an inefficiency or confusion in the process where declarations are started but not completed or submitted. Addressing the root cause of these "saved" states could potentially increase process efficiency.

8. **Repetitive Rework**: The existence of multiple loops of rejection and re-submission in some variants suggests a lack of effective corrective action or feedback mechanisms, leading to repetitive errors and increased cycle times. Implementing a more robust feedback
