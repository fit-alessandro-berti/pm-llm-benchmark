Below is a business-level walkthrough of the process, aligned with the pseudoBPMN and explaining the purpose of each step, the gateways, and the paths (including loops and convergences).

---

## 1. Highlevel overview

The process handles a customer request from first contact to final confirmation. It:

1. Receives and classifies the request as **standard** or **custom**.
2. For **standard** requests, performs standard checks (including credit and inventory) and calculates a delivery date.
3. For **custom** requests, evaluates feasibility and, if feasible, prepares a custom quote; if not feasible, sends a rejection and ends.
4. For both paths, decides whether **manager approval** is needed.
5. If approval is required, obtains it; if rejected, reworks and loops back to revisit key steps.
6. Once all conditions are met, generates the final invoice and sends a confirmation to the customer.

## 2. Stepbystep explanation

### 2.1 Start and initial reception

**Start Event**  
Represents the trigger for the process—typically when a new customer request is received (e.g., via email, web form, or sales rep).

**Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**  
Purpose:
- Capture all necessary customer and request details (contact info, items requested, quantities, deadlines, special requirements).
- Register the request in the system (e.g., CRM or order management).
- Ensure the request is ready to be evaluated.

---

### 2.2 Classifying the request type (standard vs custom)

**Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"**  
This is an **exclusive gateway**: only one path is taken based on the classification.

- **[If Type = Standard]  Task B1**
- **[If Type = Custom]  Task B2**

Business meaning:
- The organization distinguishes **standard** requests (predefined products/services, typical conditions) from **custom** requests (special modifications, non-standard configurations, bespoke solutions).

---

### 2.3 Standard request path

**Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**  
Purpose:
- Check that the request fits within the “standard” catalog (e.g., a known product code, standard options).
- Verify data completeness and correctness (e.g., valid customer account, correct delivery address).
- Possibly check basic business rules (e.g., minimum order quantity, standard pricing rules).

If validation passes, proceed to the parallel checks.

#### Parallel checks for standard requests

**Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**  
This is a **parallel gateway** (ANDsplit). It starts multiple activities at the same time.

From here, the process branches into two parallel tasks:

- **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
- **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**

**Task C1: "Credit Check"**  
Purpose:
- Assess the customer’s credit status (credit limit, payment history, outstanding balance).
- Decide whether the customer is eligible for the requested transaction under current terms.

**Task C2: "Inventory Check"**  
Purpose:
- Verify stock availability for all requested items.
- Check warehouse locations, lead times, and any stock constraints.

**All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**  
This is the **parallel gateway join (ANDjoin)**:
- The process **waits for both C1 and C2 to complete**.
- Only when *both* the credit and inventory checks are finished does the flow continue.

**Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**  
Purpose:
- Use the results from the credit and inventory checks plus logistics data to calculate a realistic delivery date.
- Take into account:
  - Actual stock levels (from C2).
  - Any constraints that could affect timing (e.g., production lead time if stock is low, shipping schedules).
- This yields a key commercial condition: when the customer can expect the delivery.

At this point the standard path is ready to proceed to the approval decision.

---

### 2.4 Custom request path

**Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**  
Purpose:
- Evaluate whether the requested customization is technically, operationally, and commercially feasible.
- Tasks may include:
  - Engineering/technical assessment.
  - Capacity and resource assessment.
  - Rough cost estimation and risk analysis.
- The output is a recommendation: feasible or not feasible, plus constraints.

**Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**  
An **exclusive gateway** making a yes/no decision based on Task B2’s outcome:

- **[If Yes]  Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- **[If No]  Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"  End Event**

**[If Yes] – Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**  
Purpose:
- Translate the feasibility result into a commercial offer:
  - Price and cost breakdown.
  - Proposed delivery timeline.
  - Scope and technical specifications.
  - Any special terms or conditions.
- This creates the formal proposal for the custom request.

**[If No] – Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"  End Event**  
Purpose:
- Inform the customer that the requested customization cannot be carried out (e.g., due to technical constraints or excessive risk/cost).
- The process ends here for this request—no quotation, no approval, no invoice.

If the customization is feasible (Yes path), the flow continues; otherwise, it terminates.

---

### 2.5 Convergence of standard and custom paths

**"After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed"**  
Conceptually, this is where:

- Standard path flows from **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**, and
- Custom path flows from **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**,

and both converge into the same downstream decision point.

In BPMN, this is usually an **exclusive merge**:
- Only one of those incoming paths is active for a given request (a request is either standard or custom).
- That single active branch flows into the next gateway.

This is the point at which we have:
- For a **standard** request: a validated order with a calculated delivery date.
- For a **custom** request: a prepared custom quotation.

---

### 2.6 Approval decision

**Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**  
Another **exclusive gateway**, deciding whether managerial approval is required:

- **[If Yes]  Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- **[If No]  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**

Business meaning (typical triggers for “approval needed” may include, for example):
- Order value exceeds a certain monetary threshold.
- Margins are below standard.
- Non-standard terms (e.g., unusual discounts, extended payment terms).
- Particular risk factors (e.g., borderline credit, large custom work).

If the request meets criteria requiring oversight, it goes to approval; otherwise, it can proceed directly to invoicing.

---

### 2.7 Approval workflow and rework loop

**Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**  
Purpose:
- Present the order or quotation to the designated approver (manager, risk officer, etc.).
- The approver reviews:
  - The pricing/quotation.
  - Feasibility assessment (for custom).
  - Credit and inventory situation (for standard).
  - Business impact and risk.
- The approver either grants or denies approval.

**Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**  
Exclusive decision based on the manager’s response:

- **[If Yes]  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
- **[If No]  Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**

**[If No] – Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**  
Purpose:
- Analyze why approval was denied and modify the proposal accordingly:
  - Adjust price, margin, or discount.
  - Change delivery date or schedule.
  - Modify scope or technical specs (especially for custom).
- This step is explicitly modeled as feeding into a **loop**:

  - For **custom** requests: Task H  **Task E1 ("Prepare Custom Quotation")**  
    The team revises the custom quote (e.g., higher price, longer delivery, narrower scope) and then sends it through the approval decision again.

  - For **standard** requests: Task H  **Task D ("Calculate Delivery Date")**  
    The team may adjust parameters affecting the delivery date or other standard conditions (e.g., different shipping option, partial delivery) and then send the revised terms back through the approval decision.

Once rework is done, the process flows again toward the “Is Approval Needed?” / “Is Approval Granted?” logic (depending on how the detailed BPMN is implemented), effectively creating a cycle until:
- An acceptable, approvable set of conditions is found, or
- The request is abandoned (though the latter is not explicitly modeled in your pseudodiagram).

**[If Yes] – Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**  
Purpose:
- Create the official invoice based on the final approved conditions:
  - Final agreed price.
  - Taxes, fees, discounts.
  - Payment terms.
  - Delivery conditions.
- This document becomes the basis for payment and fulfillment.

Note: If “Is Approval Needed?” was **No**, the process jumps directly to this step, skipping the approval loop.

---

### 2.8 Final customer communication and process end

**Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**  
Purpose:
- Communicate the final outcome to the customer, typically including:
  - Confirmation of order/contract.
  - Copy or summary of the invoice.
  - Agreed delivery date and key terms.
- Could be via email, portal update, or other channels.

**End Event**  
Indicates that the process is complete:
- For **approved/confirmed** requests, after confirmation is sent.
- For **infeasible custom** requests, after a rejection notice is sent (E2).

---

## 3. Gateway types and how paths converge/loop

### Exclusive Gateways (XOR)

Used where exactly one branch is chosen:

1. **"Check Request Type"** – chooses **Standard** vs **Custom** path.
2. **"Is Customization Feasible?"** – **Yes** (continue) vs **No** (reject and end).
3. **"Is Approval Needed?"** – **Yes** (go to approval) vs **No** (direct to invoice).
4. **"Is Approval Granted?"** – **Yes** (invoice) vs **No** (rework loop).

**Convergence with XOR:**  
After the standard and custom branches (D and E1), only one is active and flows into the next gateway. This is a simple merge.

### Parallel Gateways (AND)

Used in the standard path:

- **"Run Parallel Checks"**:
  - **ANDsplit**: starts **Credit Check (C1)** and **Inventory Check (C2)** simultaneously.
  - **ANDjoin**: waits for both C1 and C2 to be completed before moving to **Calculate Delivery Date (D)**.

### Loops

The loop occurs via **Task H ("Re-evaluate Conditions")**:

- If approval is **denied**, the process goes back to:
  - **E1** (for custom) or
  - **D** (for standard),
and then returns to the approval decision again.  
This models iterative refinement until conditions satisfy the approver.

## 4. Differences between standard and custom request handling

**Standard requests:**
- Validation: **Task B1** checks the request against standard rules.
- Parallel operational/risk checks: **Credit Check (C1)** and **Inventory Check (C2)** run in parallel.
- Output before approval: **Task D** produces a delivery date based on standard products and current stock.

**Custom requests:**
- Feasibility: **Task B2** does a deeper, often technical feasibility analysis.
- There is a feasibility gate: **"Is Customization Feasible?"**; infeasible requests are rejected early (E2).
- Output before approval: **Task E1** produces a **custom quotation** (custom pricing, custom delivery, custom conditions).

**Common steps after those path-specific tasks:**
- Both paths feed into the same approval logic: **"Is Approval Needed?"  Approval  Invoice  Confirmation**.

---

## 5. When are approvals and rework triggered?

**Approvals are triggered when:**
- The **"Is Approval Needed?"** gateway evaluates to **Yes**, according to your organization’s rules (e.g., large value, high risk, special terms, certain types of custom work).
- The request then goes to **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**, followed by **"Is Approval Granted?"**.

**Rework is triggered when:**
- The **"Is Approval Granted?"** gateway evaluates to **No**.
- The process then executes **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**, which:
  - Adjusts the terms (price, scope, dates, etc.).
  - Loops back to:
    - **E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation)** for custom requests, or
    - **D (Calculate Delivery Date)** for standard requests.
- The revised request goes through the approval logic again until it is either approved or, outside the diagram’s scope, canceled.

---

This structure allows the business to:
- Efficiently process straightforward standard orders.
- Carefully analyze and price custom work.
- Apply managerial control only where needed.
- Iterate offer conditions when internal approval is not initially granted.
