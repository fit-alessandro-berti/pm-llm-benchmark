 I have analyzed the provided data and proposed the following questions based on the given format and patterns. The questions are related to the approval workflow and performance metrics. The confidence scores (CS) are subjective and based on the available information:

1. What is the overall frequency of declaration submissions by an employee (CS: 95%)
    - Frequency = (Total number of submission events) / (Total unique declarations)

2. What percentage of submitted declarations get approved by the Administrator in the first attempt (CS: 90%)
    - Percentage = (Number of approvals by Administrator after first submission) / (Total number of submissions)

3. How many declarations were rejected by the Budget Owner after being approved by the Administrator (CS: 85%)
    - Number of rejections = (Total number of rejections by Budget Owner) - (Total number of approvals by Budget Owner)

4. What is the average number of times an employee re-submitted a rejected declaration (CS: 70%)
    - Average attempts = Total number of submission events for rejected declarations / Number of unique rejected declarations

5. What is the percentage of declarations that get approved after being rejected by the Supervisor and resubmitted (CS: 80%)
    - Percentage = (Number of approvals after rejection by Supervisor) / (Total number of rejections by Supervisor)

6. What is the average performance metric for a declaration approved after being rejected by an employee (CS: 75%)
    - Average performance = Total performance for approvals after employee rejection / Number of approvals after employee rejection

7. What percentage of declarations get final approval by the Supervisor on the first submission (CS: 85%)
    - Percentage = (Number of final approvals by Supervisor after first submission) / (Total number of submissions)

8. How many times did a declaration get rejected by an employee after being approved by the Pre-Approver (CS: 70%)
    - Number of rejections = Total number of rejections by employees after Pre-approval

9. What is the average performance metric for a declaration approved after being rejected by the Supervisor and resubmitted (CS: 65%)
    - Average performance = Total performance for approvals after Supervisor rejection / Number of approvals after Supervisor rejection

10. How many declarations were approved without passing through the Supervisor's final approval stage (CS: 85%)
    - Number of approvals without supervisor final approval = Total number of approvals not followed by final approval - Total number of final approvals

11. What is the average performance metric for a declaration that was approved without passing through the Supervisor's final approval stage (CS: 90%)
    - Average performance = Total performance for approvals without supervisor final approval / Number of approvals without supervisor final approval

12. How many times did an employee resubmit a declaration after it being rejected by the Administrator (CS: 75%)
    - Number of attempts = Total number of submission events for rejections by Administrator - Total number of approvals by Administrator after first submission

13. What is the average performance metric for a declaration approved after being rejected multiple times by an Administrator (CS: 60%)
    - Average performance = Total performance for approvals after Administrator rejection / Number of approvals after Administrator rejection

14. How many declarations were rejected by the Budget Owner after being approved by both the Administrator and Employee (CS: 80%)
    - Number of rejections = (Total number of rejections by Budget Owner) - (Total number of approvals by Budget Owner) after approval from Admin and Employee

15. What percentage of declarations get approved after being rejected multiple times by the Supervisor and resubmitted (CS: 70%)
    - Percentage = (Number of approvals after multiple rejections by Supervisor) / (Total number of multiple rejections by Supervisor)

16. How many times did an employee resubmit a declaration after it being rejected by the Budget Owner (CS: 70%)
    - Number of attempts = Total number of submission events for rejections by Budget Owner - Total number of approvals by Budget Owner after first submission

17. What is the average performance metric for a declaration approved after being rejected by multiple employees (CS: 65%)
    - Average performance = Total performance for approvals after multiple employee rejection / Number of approvals after multiple employee rejection

18. How many times did an employee resubmit a declaration after it being rejected by the Administrator and then approved by the Budget Owner (CS: 75%)
    - Number of attempts = Total number of submission events for approvals by Budget Owner after Administrator rejection - Total number of initial Administrator approvals

19. What is the average performance metric for a declaration that was approved after being rejected and then approved by the Budget Owner (CS: 80%)
    - Average performance = Total performance for approvals after Administrator rejection & Budget Owner approval / Number of approvals after Administrator rejection & Budget Owner approval

20. How many declarations were rejected multiple times by an employee and then approved on a subsequent submission (CS: 70%)
    - Number of approvals = Total number of final approvals after multiple employee rejections - Total number of initial employee approvals
