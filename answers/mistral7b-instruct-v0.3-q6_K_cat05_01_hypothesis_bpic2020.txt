 I have generated a list of 20 potential questions related to the given process, along with their respective confidence scores based on the provided data. The confidence scores are subjective and indicate the likelihood that the question can be answered effectively using the provided data.

1. What is the total number of submissions made by employees? (Confidence: High)
   Explanation: By counting the total number of "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" events, we can determine the total number of submissions.

2. How many declarations were approved by Administration? (Confidence: High)
   Explanation: Sum up the number of occurrences for all declaration approval events involving Administration.

3. What is the average time between a submission and final approval? (Confidence: Medium)
   Explanation: Calculate the average duration between "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" and "Request Payment" events for each variant that leads to "Payment Handled".

4. How many declarations were rejected after being approved by Administration? (Confidence: High)
   Explanation: Count the number of occurrences where a declaration was initially approved by Administration but later rejected before reaching final approval.

5. What is the frequency and performance for each process variant leading to 'Payment Handled'? (Confidence: Medium)
   Explanation: For each unique process variant that leads to "Payment Handled", determine the frequency and performance separately.

6. How many declarations were saved by employees without further action? (Confidence: High)
   Explanation: Count the number of occurrences for "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" events.

7. What percentage of declarations were rejected by Administration before being resubmitted and approved again? (Confidence: Medium)
   Explanation: Calculate the ratio of the total number of declarations that were initially rejected by Administration, then resubmitted, approved, and handled as a percentage of the total submissions.

8. How many declarations underwent all possible approval stages before being handled? (Confidence: High)
   Explanation: Count the number of occurrences for process variants that include all approval stages before "Payment Handled".

9. What is the frequency and performance of each individual approval stage in the process? (Confidence: Medium)
   Explanation: For each unique approval stage, determine the frequency and performance separately.

10. How many declarations were rejected by Supervisors after being approved at least once? (Confidence: High)
    Explanation: Count the number of occurrences where a declaration was initially approved but later rejected by a Supervisor before reaching final approval or payment handling.

11. What is the total number of unique employees involved in the process? (Confidence: Low)
    Explanation: This information may not be directly available from the provided data, as it does not specify individual employee names. However, it could potentially be inferred if there are a small number of declarations and a large number of different process variants.

12. How many times was each approval stage skipped during the process? (Confidence: Low)
    Explanation: This requires comparing each declaration's process variant with the standard process, but it is not straightforward due to multiple variations in the process.

13. What is the average number of approvals required before a declaration can be handled for payment? (Confidence: Medium)
    Explanation: Calculate the average number of approval stages each declaration went through before reaching "Payment Handled".

14. How many declarations were rejected after being approved by pre-approvers but eventually handled for payment? (Confidence: High)
    Explanation: Count the number of occurrences where a declaration was initially approved by a Pre-Approver, then rejected by another approval stage but eventually handled for payment.

15. What percentage of declarations were handled for payment within 24 hours after final approval? (Confidence: Low)
    Explanation: Calculate the ratio of the number of declarations that reached "Payment Handled" within 24 hours after final approval, and compare it to the total number of declarations that reached final approval.

16. How many times did a declaration go through the rejection-resubmission-approval cycle more than once before being handled for payment? (Confidence: Low)
    Explanation: Identify declarations that were rejected after initial approval, resubmitted, approved again, and possibly rejected again before reaching final approval or payment handling.

17. What is the average number of rejection-resubmission cycles a declaration goes through before being handled for payment? (Confidence: Low)
    Explanation: Calculate the average number of rejection-resubmission cycles each declaration went through before reaching "Payment Handled".

18. How many declarations were rejected by budget owners after being approved at least once? (Confidence: Medium)
    Explanation: Count the number of occurrences where a declaration was initially approved but later rejected by a Budget Owner before reaching final approval or payment handling.

19. What is the average time between a rejection event and resubmission for declarations that were eventually handled for payment? (Confidence: Low)
    Explanation: Calculate the average duration between "Declaration REJECTED" and subsequent "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" events for declarations that were eventually handled for payment.

20. How many times was a declaration rejected after being saved by an employee but later resubmitted and handled for payment? (Confidence: Low)
    Explanation: Identify declarations that were saved by employees and later resubmitted, approved, and eventually handled for payment. This question assumes the connection between saved declarations and subsequent submissions, which is not explicitly stated in the provided data.
