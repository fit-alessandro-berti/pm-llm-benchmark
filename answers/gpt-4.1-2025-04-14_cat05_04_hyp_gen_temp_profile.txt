**Anomalous Temporal Patterns in the Claim Handling Process**

---

**1. Identification of Anomalies**

- **R  P (Receive to Approve):**  
  - *Observation*: Average time is about 25 hours (90,000 seconds) with an extremely low standard deviation (1 hr / 3,600 seconds).
  - *Implication*: Approvals occur on a highly rigid schedule after claim receipt, suggesting possible automation or a system-enforced wait time.

- **P  N (Approve to Notify):**  
  - *Observation*: Mean delay is 7 days (604,800 sec) with very high variability (2 days / 172,800 sec).
  - *Implication*: Notifications post-approval are severely delayed for some cases; in others, it happens much faster, indicating inconsistent process execution.

- **A  C (Assign to Close):**  
  - *Observation*: Claims are closed, on average, within 2 hours of being assigned, with a moderate amount of variability.
  - *Implication*: Suggests some claims may be closed immediately after assignment without following standard intermediate steps (e.g., evaluation, approval).

- **E  N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
  - *Observation*: Transition from evaluation to notification happens, on average, in 5 minutes (300 sec), with low STDEV.
  - *Implication*: This duration seems unrealistically short for review and updates, possibly indicative of missed approval or a system-triggered notification.

**2. Hypotheses for Detected Anomalies**

- **Rigid R  P Timing:**
  - Claim approvals may be enforced by an automated batch process that runs at fixed times.
  - Approvals could be delayed due to an artificial system holding period (e.g., waiting for documents, regulation).

- **Inconsistent P  N Delay:**
  - Bottlenecks may exist in the notification process due to staff availability or technical issues, causing large queues.
  - Notifications might be deprioritized or dependent on external communications, like postal mail or customer response.

- **Quick A  C Closure:**
  - Some claims may be auto-closed (possibly due to withdrawal, cancellation, or system error) immediately after assignment, without evaluation.
  - Adjusters may bypass standard workflow steps, closing certain claim types (e.g., duplicates, invalid cases) right after assignment.

- **Very Fast E  N Transition:**
  - Automatic notifications may be sent out immediately after evaluation without requiring formal approval, possibly due to missing process controls.
  - The evaluation step may be superficial or auto-populated in the system, triggering instant notification.

**3. SQL-Based Verification Approaches**

**A. Claims with R  P transition tightly clustered around the mean (rigid timing):**

```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
ORDER BY r_to_p_seconds;
```

*Check: Does timing cluster tightly around 90,000 seconds? Is there a spike at this interval across claims?*

---

**B. Claims with P  N delay exceeding or much less than average (identify bottlenecks/outliers):**

```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
  AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 864000 -- >10 days
       OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 86400) -- <1 day
ORDER BY p_to_n_seconds DESC;
```

*Check: Which claims have extreme lags or are unusually fast?*

---

**C. Claims closed shortly after assignment (possible premature closure):**

```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_seconds,
       c.claim_type,
       a.region
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON a.name = ce1.resource
WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 3600 -- less than 1 hour
ORDER BY a_to_c_seconds ASC;
```

*Check: Are premature closures concentrated in certain claim types or regions?*

---

**D. E  N transitions that are suspiciously short (possible bypassing of approval):**

```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 600 -- less than 10 minutes
ORDER BY e_to_n_seconds ASC;
```

*Check: For these claims, did the 'P' (Approve) event occur at all? Are certain adjusters/resources responsible?*

---

**E. Correlate anomalous timings with adjusters or claim types:**

```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.activity, a.adjuster_id, a.region, c.claim_type, ce.resource
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name -- adjuster_name = resource
WHERE ce.claim_id IN (
    -- Subquery from A/B/C/D for claims with anomalous times
)
```

*Check: Do specific adjusters, regions, or claim types correlate with anomalous timing, hinting at process, training, or resource issues?*

---

**Summary:**  
These queries enable drilling down into specific claims and segments that exhibit anomalous timing. By correlating such patterns with adjusters, claim types, and regions, one can test hypotheses about root causes, such as automation, staff bottlenecks, or workflow bypassing.
