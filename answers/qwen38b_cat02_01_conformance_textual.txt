Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to check which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process described. Let me start by understanding the normative process thoroughly.

First, the process starts with "Receive order." Then, "Check inventory" must come next. If inventory is sufficient, the flow is: Authorize Payment, Package Items, Ship Order, Close Order. If not sufficient, it goes: Cancel Order, then Close Order. The key constraints are that Authorize Payment must come after Check Inventory and before Package Items. Package Items must be after Authorization and before Shipping. Shipping should only happen after Packaging and never after cancellation. Close Order is always the last step.

Now, let me go through each case one by one.

Case 1:
Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. That seems to follow the correct flow. All steps are in order, no issues here. So no violation.

Case 2:
Sequence: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, here the order is Package before Authorize. According to the norm, Authorize must come before Package. So this is a violation. Because they did Package Items before Authorizing Payment. The norm says that "Authorize Payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging. So this case is wrong here.

Case 3:
Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. Oh, here after Cancel, they did Ship Order. But according to the norm, after Cancel, the next step should be Close Order. Shipping after cancellation is a violation. The norm states that "Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after cancellation. So this case is invalid.

Case 4:
Sequence: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. This seems correct. The inventory check was done, then canceled, then closed. No issues here. So this is compliant.

Case 5:
Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, they skipped Packaging Items. According to the norm, after Authorize comes Package, then Ship. So if they went from Authorize directly to Ship, that's a violation. Because Package Items should be done before Shipping. So this case is missing the Package step, which is required. So this is a violation.

Wait, let me double-check. The norm says that after Authorize Payment comes Package Items, then Ship. So if a case skips Package, that's a problem. So Case 5 is missing the Package step, which is a violation. So Case 5 is wrong.

So, the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5. Let me check again.

Case 2: Package before Authorize. Violation.

Case 3: Ship after Cancel. Violation.

Case 5: Ship before Package. Violation.

Case 4 is correct. Case 1 is correct.

So the answer should be Cases 2, 3, and 5.

### **Violation Analysis**

#### **Case 2**  
**Violation:** *Package items* occurs before *Authorize payment*.  
- **Normative Rule:** "Authorize payment" must occur **before** "Package items" (as payment authorization is required to prepare items for shipment).  
- **Explanation:** In Case 2, the sequence is **Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close**. This violates the requirement that **payment authorization must precede packaging**. The process logic assumes that payment is validated before any physical preparation of items, which is critical for ensuring financial and logistical compliance.

#### **Case 3**  
**Violation:** *Ship order* occurs after *Cancel order*.  
- **Normative Rule:** "Ship order" must **never** occur after a cancellation. Once an order is canceled, the process must terminate with "Close order" immediately.  
- **Explanation:** In Case 3, the sequence is **Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close**. This violates the rule that **shipping is prohibited after cancellation**. The cancellation step signifies the order is invalid, and any subsequent fulfillment steps (like shipping) are logically and procedurally incorrect.  

---

#### **Case 5**  
**Violation:** *Ship order* occurs before *Package items*.  
- **Normative Rule:** "Package items" must occur **before** "Ship order" (as items must be physically prepared before they are shipped).  
- **Explanation:** In Case 5, the sequence is **Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close**. This skips the **Package items** step entirely, which is required to prepare the order for shipment. The normative process mandates that packaging is a prerequisite for shipping, ensuring that items are properly prepared for delivery.  

---

### **Compliant Cases**  
- **Case 1:** Follows the correct sequence: **Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close**.  
- **Case 4:** Follows the cancellation path correctly: **Receive  Check  Cancel  Close**.
