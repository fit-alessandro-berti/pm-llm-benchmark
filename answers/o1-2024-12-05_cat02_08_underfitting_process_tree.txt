**Example of a Problematic Trace:**  
```
Receive_Order, 
Check_Inventory, 
Ship_Order,       ← occurs too early
Authorize_Payment,
Package_Items,
Close_Order
```

**Why This Trace Is Problematic:**

In the given process tree, the "successful" execution path after checking inventory is represented by a parallel node containing **Authorize_Payment**, **Package_Items**, and **Ship_Order**. By using a parallel (AND) operator, the model implicitly allows these three activities to occur in *any* order. From a purely syntactic standpoint, as long as these three events happen before the final **Close_Order**, the trace is considered valid by the model.

However, from a domain perspective, this is clearly incorrect. In a realistic Order-to-Cash process:

1. **Authorize_Payment** should occur before shipping the items. You wouldn’t want to ship goods without confirming payment.
2. **Package_Items** should logically occur before the order is shipped. It doesn’t make sense to ship items that haven’t been packaged.

The parallel operator in the provided model introduces an underfitting issue: it does not enforce the necessary constraints that payments be authorized and items be packaged before shipping. Thus, a sequence that involves **Ship_Order** taking place before **Authorize_Payment** or **Package_Items** (as shown in the above trace) is accepted by the model but is not acceptable in a proper Order-to-Cash scenario.
