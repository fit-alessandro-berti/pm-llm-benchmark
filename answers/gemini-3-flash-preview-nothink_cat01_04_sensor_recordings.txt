Based on the analysis of the sensor data patterns in the event log, the manufacturing process for Machine M1 can be divided into seven distinct phases.

### Process Summary Table

| Event Range | Assigned Activity Label | Rationale for Labeling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 – 3** | **Standby / Idling** | Ambient temperature, zero vibration/flow, and minimal energy consumption indicate the machine is powered on but inactive. |
| **4 – 6** | **Cutting / Machining** | Significant increases in vibration (30-38 Hz) and temperature, coupled with a changing tool position and high material flow, suggest active material removal. |
| **7 – 8** | **Part Assembly / Pressing** | Vibration drops while pressure increases to 2 bar. Tool position becomes fixed, suggesting parts are being held together or pressed into place. |
| **9** | **Welding / Thermal Joining** | A massive spike in temperature (80°C), energy (5.0 kWh), and vibration indicates a high-intensity thermal event common in welding. |
| **10** | **Cool Down / Reset** | A sharp drop across all sensors (Temp, Vibration, Energy) suggests a brief period to allow the joint to set or the tool to retract. |
| **11 – 12** | **Quality Inspection / Offloading** | Low, steady vibration and material flow at a final tool position (20mm) suggest a sensor-based check or moving the finished part off the line. |
| **13 – 15** | **Standby / Cycle End** | All readings return to original baseline levels; tool position resets to 0, indicating the completion of the cycle. |

### Detailed Analysis and Rationale

#### 1. Standby / Idling (Events 1–3)
The readings here represent the baseline state of the machine. The **Temperature** is at an ambient 20°C, **Vibration** and **Material Flow** are at 0, and **Energy** consumption is negligible (approx. 0.45 kWh). This is the "ready" state before work begins.

#### 2. Cutting / Machining (Events 4–6)
As the process begins, we see a surge in **Energy** and **Vibration**. The **Tool Position** moves incrementally (5mm  7mm  10mm), which indicates the machine is traversing a workpiece. The rise in **Temperature** (up to 58°C) is consistent with the friction generated during a cutting or milling operation. The high **Material Flow** (5 units/s) likely represents the processing of raw material or the use of coolant.

#### 3. Assembling / Joining (Events 7–8)
The dynamics change here: **Pressure** increases to its maximum (2 bar), while **Vibration** drops significantly (from 38 Hz down to 10 Hz). The **Tool Position** stops moving (staying at 15mm). This pattern—high pressure and static position—is a hallmark of an assembly step where two components are being pressed or held together.

#### 4. Welding / Thermal Bonding (Event 9)
This single event shows an extreme "spike" pattern. **Temperature** jumps to 80°C, and **Energy** consumption more than doubles to 5.0 kWh. This concentrated burst of heat and power, occurring while the tool is stationary, most likely represents a spot weld or a thermal bonding process used to fuse the previously assembled parts.

#### 5. Post-Process Cool Down (Event 10)
Immediately following the heat spike, the **Temperature** and **Energy** drop precipitously. This phase is necessary in manufacturing to stabilize the material after a high-heat operation before it is moved or inspected.

#### 6. Quality Inspection / Offloading (Events 11–12)
The **Tool Position** moves to its furthest point (20mm), and we see a small, steady amount of **Material Flow** (1 unit/s) and low **Vibration**. This suggests the machine is either performing a final measurement check or moving the finished part to a conveyor belt for the next stage of the factory process.

#### 7. Standby / Cycle End (Events 13–15)
The data returns exactly to the state seen in Events 1–3. The **Tool Position** has reset to 0 (home position), and all active sensors have dropped to baseline, signifying the machine is waiting for the next workpiece.
