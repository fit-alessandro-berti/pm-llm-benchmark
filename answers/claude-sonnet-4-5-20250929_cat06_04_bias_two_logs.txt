# Bias Analysis of Event Logs: Group A vs Group B

## Executive Summary
**Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits systematic bias** through a community-based score adjustment mechanism that creates preferential treatment for local residents with specific community affiliations, while Group A (Protected Group) receives no such advantages.

---

## Detailed Bias Analysis

### 1. **Primary Bias Mechanism: Community Score Adjustment**

**Group B receives systematic advantages through:**
- **+10 point "Community Boost"** for members of "Highland Civic Darts Club"
- This adjustment occurs during the PreliminaryScoring stage
- The boost directly influences final decisions

**Evidence from the logs:**
| Case | Original Score | Community Affiliation | Adjustment | Final Score | Decision |
|------|----------------|----------------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| U001 | 720 | Highland Civic Darts Club | +10 | 730 | Approved |
| U002 | 710 | None | 0 | 710 | Rejected |
| U003 | 695 | Highland Civic Darts Club | +10 | 705 | Approved |

**Group A receives NO adjustments:**
- All ScoreAdjustment values = 0
- No consideration for any community affiliations
- Decisions based solely on preliminary scores

---

### 2. **Impact on Decision Outcomes**

### **Critical Case Comparison: U003 vs P002**

**Case U003 (Group B - Unprotected):**
- Preliminary Score: **695** (below typical approval threshold)
- Community Boost: **+10 points**  Adjusted Score: **705**
- **Decision: APPROVED**

**Case P002 (Group A - Protected):**
- Preliminary Score: **710** (higher than U003's original score)
- Community Boost: **0 points**
- **Decision: REJECTED**

**This demonstrates clear discriminatory impact:** An applicant from Group B with a lower initial score (695) receives approval, while a Group A applicant with a higher score (710) is rejected.

---

### 3. **Systematic Discrimination Patterns**

### **LocalResident Status as a Proxy for Discrimination**

| Attribute | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| LocalResident Status | FALSE (all cases) | TRUE (all cases) |
| Community Group Access | None | Highland Civic Darts Club available |
| Score Adjustments | Never applied | Applied when affiliated |

**This creates a two-tier system:**
1. **Tier 1 (Privileged):** Local residents with community connections receive score boosts
2. **Tier 2 (Disadvantaged):** Non-local residents (Protected Group) have no access to score enhancements

---

### 4. **Manifestation of Bias**

### **A. Structural/Institutional Bias**
The process design embeds advantages for one group:
- Community membership creates a privileged pathway
- Protected Group members are systematically excluded from this pathway
- The bias is **automated and algorithmic** (applied by "Scoring Engine")

### **B. Threshold Manipulation**
The effective approval threshold differs by group:
- **Group A (Protected):** Must achieve ~720+ preliminary score
- **Group B (Unprotected with community ties):** Effective threshold is ~685 (695-10=685 equivalent)

**This creates a 35-point advantage gap.**

### **C. Intersectional Disadvantage**
Group B members WITHOUT community affiliation (U002) are treated similarly to Group A, suggesting:
- The bias specifically advantages **LocalResident = TRUE + CommunityGroup affiliation**
- Protected Group members are **categorically excluded** from community group membership opportunities

---

### 5. **Statistical Evidence of Disparate Impact**

### **Approval Rates:**

**Group A (Protected):**
- Cases with score 720: 2/2 approved (100%)
- Cases with score <720: 0/1 approved (0%)
- **Overall approval rate: 2/3 (66.7%)**

**Group B (Unprotected):**
- Cases with community boost: 2/2 approved (100%)
- Cases without community boost: 0/1 approved (0%)
- **Overall approval rate: 2/3 (66.7%)**

**However, adjusted for equivalent scores:**
- U003 would have been rejected without the boost (score 695 < 710 rejection threshold)
- **Effective approval rate for Group B with community ties: 100% (2/2)**
- **Effective approval rate for Group A at equivalent original scores: 0-50%**

---

### 6. **Legal and Ethical Implications**

### **Disparate Treatment**
The process explicitly applies different rules:
- Community boosts are **only available** to LocalResidents
- Protected Group members cannot access this benefit

### **Disparate Impact**
Even if not intentionally discriminatory, the effect is:
- Protected Group members face **higher effective approval thresholds**
- Lower-scoring Unprotected Group members gain approval over higher-scoring Protected Group members

### **Potential Violations**
This could violate:
- **Fair lending laws** (if this is a credit/loan process)
- **Equal opportunity regulations**
- **Anti-discrimination statutes** that prohibit using protected characteristics as proxies

---

### 7. **Mechanisms of Bias Propagation**

```
LocalResident = FALSE (Protected Group)
    
No access to Community Groups
    
No Score Adjustments possible
    
Higher effective threshold for approval
    
SYSTEMATIC DISADVANTAGE
```

```
LocalResident = TRUE (Unprotected Group)
    
Potential access to Community Groups
    
+10 Score Adjustment available
    
Lower effective threshold for approval
    
SYSTEMATIC ADVANTAGE
```

---

## Conclusion

**The bias is definitively present in Group B's process** and manifests as **systematic advantage** for that group through:

1. **Algorithmic score manipulation** favoring local residents with community ties
2. **Categorical exclusion** of Protected Group members from enhancement mechanisms
3. **Disparate outcomes** where lower-scoring Group B applicants succeed while higher-scoring Group A applicants fail
4. **Institutionalized discrimination** embedded in the automated scoring system

**Recommendation:** The "Community Boost" mechanism should be eliminated or made equally accessible to all applicants regardless of residency status to ensure fair and unbiased decision-making.
