To create the requested POWL models, we will define two distinct workflows based on the hiring process described. Both will incorporate the given activities and control structures, but will differ in their treatment of community affiliations during the cultural fit evaluation.

### Model 1: With Potential Unfairness (XOR Branch for Community Affiliation)

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define XOR branching for community affiliation check
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
XOR_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR,
                             children=[(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)])

# Define the workflow model 1 (with potential unfairness)
workflow_1 = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        ReceiveApplication,
        DataCompletenessCheck,
        SkillAssessment,
        XOR_choice,
        CulturalFitCheck,
        ManagerialReview,
        FinalDecision
    ],
    order={
        ReceiveApplication -> DataCompletenessCheck,
        DataCompletenessCheck -> SkillAssessment,
        SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck,
        CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview,
        ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision
    }
)
workflow_1.order.add_edge(XOR_choice, CulturalFitCheck)  # Linking XOR choice to cultural fit check

# Explanation:
# The workflow starts with receiving the application and checking data completeness.
# If complete, a skill assessment follows. Depending on the score, candidates proceed to either a standard cultural fit check or an enhanced one due to community affiliation.
# This branching can introduce subtle bias in favor of affiliated candidates during the cultural fit evaluation.

```

### Model 2: Without Unfairness (Standard Cultural Fit for All)

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities as before
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the workflow model 2 (without potential unfairness)
workflow_2 = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        ReceiveApplication,
        DataCompletenessCheck,
        SkillAssessment,
        CulturalFitCheck,
        ManagerialReview,
        FinalDecision
    ],
    order={
        ReceiveApplication -> DataCompletenessCheck,
        DataCompletenessCheck -> SkillAssessment,
        SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck,
        CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview,
        ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision
    }
)
# No additional edges for community affiliation check as this path is not present

# Explanation:
# The workflow starts with receiving the application and checking data completeness.
# Following skill assessment, all candidates proceed to a standard cultural fit check without variation based on community affiliations.
# This ensures a more level playing field during the evaluation process.

```

Each POWL model is represented as a StrictPartialOrder object with nodes representing activities and edges indicating the partial order of execution. In Model 1, an XOR choice node represents the potential for bias due to community affiliation, whereas Model 2 omits this element to eliminate any unfair advantage based on such affiliations.

### Notes:
- This example uses Python's pm4py library to define the POWL models.
- The activities are defined as Transition objects with labels representing their purpose in the process.
- Edge additions represent the partial order between activities, ensuring some are prerequisites for others.
- The XOR operator introduces a choice node that leads to different branches of the workflow, modeling the potential bias in the cultural fit evaluation.
