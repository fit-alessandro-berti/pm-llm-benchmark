Below is the Python code to construct the POWL model for the described digital service provisioning process using the `pm4py` library. This code uses the `StrictPartialOrder`, `OperatorPOWL`, `Transition`, and `SilentTransition` classes to model the tasks, loops, and exclusive choices, as described in the scenario.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the individual transitions (activities)
SR = Transition(label="Service Request (SR)")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation (DA)")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization (ACI)")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration (BNC)")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment (CD)")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment (MD)")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance (QA)")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit (SA)")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")

# Silent transition (if necessary for completeness)
skip = SilentTransition()

# Loop for the Base Network Configuration (BNC) and Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)
loop_bnc_dr = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Exclusive choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD)
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Define the partial order (strict ordering between tasks)
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop_bnc_dr, xor_deployment, QA, SA, GLA])

# Add edges for the partial order to define the execution sequence
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # SR must be completed before CS
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)  # CS must be completed before DA
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)  # CS must be completed before ACI
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_bnc_dr)  # DA must be completed before entering the loop
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_bnc_dr)  # ACI must be completed before entering the loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_bnc_dr, xor_deployment)  # After the loop ends, go to deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, QA)  # QA must happen after deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, SA)  # SA must happen after deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)  # QA must be completed before GLA
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)  # SA must be completed before GLA

# The tasks can be performed concurrently as indicated in the scenario (DA, ACI are parallel)
# So, we do not add any ordering constraints between DA and ACI.

# The final POWL model is now constructed
pm4py.objects.powl.obj.display_powl_model(root)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transitions:**
   - Each task in the process is modeled as a `Transition`. These include Service Request (SR), Contract Setup (CS), Datacenter Allocation (DA), Access Control Initialization (ACI), Base Network Configuration (BNC), Debug & Reconfigure (D&R), Containerized Deployment (CD), Monolithic Deployment (MD), Quality Assurance (QA), Security Audit (SA), and Go-Live Approval (GLA).

2. **Loop:**
   - The loop between BNC and D&R is modeled with `OperatorPOWL` using the `Operator.LOOP`. This loop will repeat the process of configuring the network until it is stable.

3. **Exclusive Choice:**
   - The choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD) is modeled with `OperatorPOWL` using the `Operator.XOR`. This ensures that only one of these two deployment methods is selected.

4. **Partial Order:**
   - The partial order is modeled using `StrictPartialOrder`, where edges define the sequence of tasks. For instance, SR must happen before CS, and both DA and ACI can happen in parallel (no constraints), but they must both complete before entering the looped configuration phase.

5. **Concurrency:**
   - DA and ACI are independent and can occur concurrently, as there is no dependency between them.

6. **Final Tasks:**
   - QA and SA can be executed in parallel or any order, but both must be completed before GLA.

7. **Display:**
   - Finally, the constructed POWL model is displayed using `pm4py.objects.powl.obj.display_powl_model(root)`.

This code represents the digital service provisioning process as a POWL model, faithfully following the described process.
