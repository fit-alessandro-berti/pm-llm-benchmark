### Analysis of Recurring Activities

After analyzing the event log, I identified the following activities that appear multiple times within the same case (i.e., they recur and carry different contextual meanings based on position, preceding events, resource, and additional context):

- **Verify Documents**: Appears twice in C001 and C003 (not in C002). The first occurrence is an initial check of submitted documents, often leading to issues requiring follow-up. The second occurrence is a re-verification after additional submissions or adjustments, confirming completeness before approval.
- **Call Customer**: Appears twice in C002 (once in C001 and C003, but not recurring in those). In C002, the first call is outbound to clarify a discrepancy (problem identification), while the second is a follow-up to confirm resolutions (closure verification). In C001 and C003, the single instance is to request return or missing info, but since it doesn't recur in those cases, I only disambiguate where it does.

Other activities like Initiate Request, Adjust Account, and Approve Request do not recur within any single case, so they retain their original names (they are unambiguous).

### Revised Event Log

Below is the revised event log with renamed activities. Only the recurring activities have been renamed for disambiguation. All other columns (Case ID, Timestamp, Resource, Additional Context) remain unchanged. The new names use descriptive prefixes to highlight context (e.g., "Initial" for first occurrences, "Follow-up" or "Re-" for subsequent ones).

### Justification of Naming Choices

- **Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification / Re-Verify Documents**: 
  - The first occurrence (e.g., right after Initiate Request in all cases) is always an initial check of provided documents, often revealing gaps (context: "Agent checks identity documents" or "Physical verification of ID"; position: early in the flow, followed by calls or adjustments). I renamed it "Initial Document Verification" to emphasize its role as the starting validation step.
  - The second occurrence (in C001 and C003) happens after additional submissions (C001) or account adjustments (C003), serving as a confirmatory re-check before approval (context: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided" or "Re-verify docs after account adjustment"; position: late in the flow, directly before Approve Request). "Re-Verify Documents" highlights the iterative, resolution-focused nature, distinguishing it from the initial check. This disambiguates based on sequence and context triggers like missing docs or adjustments.

- **Call Customer  Initial Call to Clarify Discrepancy / Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments (in C002); Call Customer for Missing Docs / Call Customer to Return (in C001/C003)**:
  - In C002, the first call is problem-oriented (context: "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy"; position: after initial verification, before adjustment), so "Initial Call to Clarify Discrepancy" captures its diagnostic purpose. The second is confirmatory (context: "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made"; position: after adjustment, before approval), renamed "Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments" to reflect closure.
  - In C001 and C003 (single occurrences), names are more specific to avoid generic labeling: "Call Customer for Missing Docs" (C001; context: requesting uploads) and "Call Customer to Return" (C003; context: customer stepped out). These are tailored to unique contexts but kept consistent in structure for potential future recurrence. This renaming uses position (e.g., mid-process vs. post-adjustment) and explicit context (e.g., "discrepancy" or "missing docs") to differentiate intents, making the process flow clearer without overgeneralizing across cases. 

These changes ensure each activity name is unique within a case, improving traceability and process understanding while preserving the original log's structure.
