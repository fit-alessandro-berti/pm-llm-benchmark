## Process Mining Analysis: Manufacturing Assembly Line Events

After analyzing the sensor data patterns, I've identified several distinct phases in the manufacturing process. Here's my analysis:

### **Identified Activity Phases:**

#### **Phase 1: Machine Idle/Standby (Events 1-3, 13-15)**
- **Pattern**: Temperature at ambient (20-21°C), no vibration, no material flow, tool at neutral position (0mm), minimal energy consumption (0.40-0.50 kWh)
- **Rationale**: These readings indicate the machine is powered on but not performing active work. This appears at the beginning and end of the cycle, suggesting startup/shutdown phases.

#### **Phase 2: Cutting/Machining Operation (Events 4-6)**
- **Pattern**: Temperature rising (50-58°C), increasing vibration (30-38 Hz), consistent material flow (5 units/s), progressive tool movement (5-10mm), escalating energy consumption (2.00-3.00 kWh)
- **Rationale**: The combination of increasing temperature, significant vibration, steady material flow, and progressive tool movement strongly indicates a cutting or machining operation where material is being removed or shaped.

#### **Phase 3: Assembly/Positioning (Events 7-8)**
- **Pattern**: Moderate temperature (40°C), increased pressure (2 bar), reduced vibration (10 Hz), decreased material flow (2 units/s), stable tool position (15mm)
- **Rationale**: The higher pressure with reduced vibration and material flow suggests parts are being assembled or positioned. The stable tool position indicates precise positioning work.

#### **Phase 4: Welding Operation (Event 9)**
- **Pattern**: High temperature spike (80°C), maximum vibration (50 Hz), no material flow, high energy consumption (5.00 kWh)
- **Rationale**: The dramatic spikes in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption with zero material flow is characteristic of a welding operation, which generates intense heat and consumes significant energy.

#### **Phase 5: Cooling/Settling (Event 10)**
- **Pattern**: Temperature dropping (30°C), pressure returning to baseline (1 bar), minimal vibration (1 Hz), no material flow
- **Rationale**: This represents a cooling period after the high-energy welding operation, allowing the welded joint to cool and settle.

#### **Phase 6: Quality Inspection (Events 11-12)**
- **Pattern**: Stable low temperature (25°C), minimal vibration (5 Hz), slight material flow (1 unit/s), tool repositioned (20mm), steady moderate energy
- **Rationale**: The tool repositioning combined with stable, low-energy conditions and minimal material flow suggests inspection or measurement activities are taking place.

### **Manufacturing Process Summary:**

The complete process appears to be:
1. **Startup**  2. **Material Cutting/Machining**  3. **Part Assembly**  4. **Welding**  5. **Cooling**  6. **Quality Inspection**  7. **Shutdown**

This represents a typical manufacturing cycle where raw material is processed, assembled, joined through welding, allowed to cool, inspected for quality, and then the machine returns to idle state ready for the next cycle.
