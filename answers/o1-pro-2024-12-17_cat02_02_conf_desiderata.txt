Below is a detailed assessment of the given event log with respect to both the strict (normative) rules and the recommended (desiderata) guidelines.

### Part 1: Normative Rules Analysis

**Normative Rules Recap:**  
- Sequence must be:  
  1. Application Received  
  2. Credit Check  
  3. Risk Assessment  
  4. Loan Decision  
  5. Inform Applicant  
  6. If Approved: Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
     If Rejected: Close Case (No finalization)  
- Ordering rules must be respected:  
  - **Credit Check** before **Risk Assessment**  
  - **Risk Assessment** before **Loan Decision**  
  - **Inform Applicant** after **Loan Decision**  
  - If Approved: **Finalize Documentation** before **Close Case**  
  - If Rejected: **No Finalize Documentation** before closing

**Case 1:**  
Activities in order:  
- Application Received (2024-01-10 09:00)  
- Credit Check (09:30)  
- Risk Assessment (10:00)  
- Loan Decision (Approved) (11:00)  
- Inform Applicant (13:00)  
- Finalize Documentation (13:30)  
- Close Case (14:00)

**Check Against Normative Rules:**  
- Did we respect the sequence? Yes.  
  - Credit Check occurred before Risk Assessment.  
  - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision.  
  - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision.  
  - Since decision was Approved, Finalize Documentation occurred before Close Case.  
- No skipped or reversed steps, and no contradictory actions.

**Conclusion for Case 1:**  
No normative rule violations.

**Case 2:**  
Activities in order:  
- Application Received (2024-01-11 08:00)  
- Risk Assessment (08:20)  
- Credit Check (09:00)  
- Loan Decision (Rejected) (09:30)  
- Finalize Documentation (10:00)  
- Close Case (10:30)

**Check Against Normative Rules:**  
- Sequence Violation: A **Risk Assessment** was performed before a **Credit Check**. This violates the strict order that requires Credit Check before Risk Assessment.  
- Post-Decision Violation: The loan was rejected, yet "Finalize Documentation" was performed afterward. This is explicitly not allowed after a rejection.

**Conclusion for Case 2:**  
Two normative violations:  
1. Performed Risk Assessment before Credit Check.  
2. Finalized Documentation after a rejection.

---

**Case 3:**  
Activities in order:  
- Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00)  
- Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00)  
- Risk Assessment (11:00)  
- Loan Decision (Approved) (12:00)  
- Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00)  
- Finalize Documentation (2024-01-17 09:00)  
- Close Case (2024-01-17 10:00)

**Check Against Normative Rules:**  
- Did we respect the ordering? Yes.  
  - Credit Check before Risk Assessment: Yes (though delayed, the order is correct).  
  - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: Yes.  
  - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: Yes.  
  - Decision was Approved, and Finalize Documentation occurred before Close Case: Yes.  
- No steps appear skipped or out of sequence. No contradictory actions.

**Conclusion for Case 3:**  
No normative rule violations.

### Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but not Strict)

**Desiderata Recap:**  
- Preferred to complete Credit Check soon after Application Received (e.g., within 24 hours).  
- Preferred to Inform Applicant promptly after Loan Decision (e.g., within 48 hours).  
- Encouraged to have a Follow-up Call before closing the case.  
- Violations here are not severe, just suboptimal.

**Case-by-Case Desiderata Check:**

**Case 1:**  
- Credit Check was done 30 minutes after Application Received – this is well within the recommended 24 hours.  
- Inform Applicant occurred 2 hours after the Loan Decision, which is within 48 hours.  
- Is there a Follow-up Call? Not mentioned, but it’s only a recommendation, not a requirement.  
Since the log does not show a Follow-up Call, this might be a minor missed best practice. However, the timing recommendations were satisfied.

**Conclusion for Case 1 Desiderata:**  
- No clear timing issues.  
- Possibly no Follow-up Call (not a serious issue).

**Case 2:**  
- Credit Check was done at 09:00, which is 1 hour after the Application Received (08:00). This is within the 24-hour recommendation.  
- Inform Applicant activity is not listed (the applicant was informed implicitly via Loan Decision?), but given the loan was rejected, the main recommendation about timely informing the applicant might be considered implicitly met if “Loan Decision (Rejected)” inherently corresponds with informing. The event log shows no explicit "Inform Applicant" step before closing. This might be considered a normative omission—however, the instructions said “Inform Applicant” must occur after Loan Decision. Actually, looking carefully, we see that in the normative sequence “Inform Applicant” is a required step after the Loan Decision. Case 2’s sequence does not show an "Inform Applicant" step at all. This would actually be a normative violation. 

**Re-evaluating Case 2 Normative Sequence:**  
In the given instructions, after the Loan Decision, the applicant must be informed. Case 2 directly goes from “Loan Decision (Rejected)” to “Finalize Documentation” and then “Close Case.” This means the activity “Inform Applicant” was skipped. This is a normative rule violation as well (previously overlooked). So, this is another normative violation. Since this is a much more serious oversight than just desiderata, we correct our earlier normative assessment:

- **Additional Normative Violation for Case 2:** Failed to "Inform Applicant" after the Loan Decision. 

Desiderata considerations are overshadowed by this normative breach. Since multiple strict rule violations occurred, the desiderata discussion is almost moot. Still, from a purely desiderata standpoint, if we consider that "Inform Applicant" was mandatory and omitted, then the desiderata about timely informing is also not met. The timing recommended is irrelevant here because the activity itself never occurred.

**Conclusion for Case 2 Desiderata:**  
- The main issue is normative, so desiderata is secondary. The absence of “Inform Applicant” prevents even judging timeliness. No Follow-up Call is also noted, but overshadowed by normative violations.

**Case 3:**  
- Credit Check took place on 2024-01-14 at 10:00, while the application was received on 2024-01-12 at 09:00. This is approximately 2 days (a bit over 48 hours), which exceeds the recommended 24-hour window for Credit Check. Desiderata violation.  
- Inform Applicant occurred on 2024-01-16 15:00, but the Loan Decision was made at 2024-01-14 12:00. That’s roughly 2 days and 3 hours later, which exceeds the recommended 48-hour window to inform the applicant. Another desiderata violation.  
- No Follow-up Call was conducted before closing. This is a missed best practice, but again not a hard rule.

**Conclusion for Case 3 Desiderata:**  
- Late Credit Check: Violates timing recommendation (but not serious).
- Late Inform Applicant: Violates timing recommendation (but not serious).
- No Follow-up Call: Missed recommended best practice.

### Summary of Findings

**Normative Violations:**

- **Case 1:** None.
  
- **Case 2:** Multiple violations:  
  1. Performed Risk Assessment before Credit Check. (Order violation)  
  2. Finalized Documentation after a Rejection. (Decision outcome violation)  
  3. Failed to Inform Applicant after the Loan Decision. (Mandatory step skipped)
  
  These are serious breaches of the prescribed sequence and conditions.
  
- **Case 3:** None. All required steps occurred in correct order.

**Desiderata Violations:**

- **Case 1:** Possibly missed a Follow-up Call, but all timing guidelines were met.
- **Case 2:** Normative violations overshadow desiderata considerations. The process did not even properly inform the applicant. Timing recommendations or follow-up calls are moot given the fundamental sequence errors.
- **Case 3:**  
  - Credit Check was done >24 hours after Application Received.  
  - Inform Applicant was done >48 hours after the Loan Decision.  
  - No Follow-up Call took place.

These are suboptimal behaviors but not severe.

### Possible Interpretations/Justifications

- **Case 1:**  
  The process runs smoothly. Possibly no follow-up call is made due to resource constraints or internal policy decisions. Given everything else is perfect, it might not be considered a problem.

- **Case 2:**  
  The serious normative violations suggest a breakdown in process understanding or system error. A possible explanation:  
  - Perhaps a staff member misunderstood the order of operations or rushed into a Risk Assessment before verifying the applicant’s credit.  
  - The staff might have attempted to finalize documentation due to a misunderstanding, thinking it necessary even when rejected.  
  - The omission of informing the applicant may indicate a system glitch or human oversight. In any case, these errors highlight a need for training or system checks to prevent out-of-order tasks.

- **Case 3:**  
  While the process followed the normative rules, the delays and omissions in best practices may reflect external constraints:  
  - Credit Check delay: Possibly due to backlog or external credit bureau delays.  
  - Delayed informing of the applicant: Staff shortages, communication complexities, or waiting on additional internal approvals.  
  - No Follow-up Call: Might have been deemed unnecessary if the applicant was already considered informed and aligned, or maybe the team lacked the resources.

In all, the non-strict guidelines (desiderata) can be compromised due to various practical challenges—resource limitations, external dependency, or internal communication delays—without causing a severe procedural breach.

**Final Conclusions:**

1. **Normative Violations:**  
   - **Case 2** violates the strict process rules by performing activities out of order, skipping required steps (Inform Applicant), and performing prohibited actions (Finalizing Documentation after Rejection).

2. **Desiderata Deviations:**
   - **Case 3** shows timing and follow-up call recommendations not being met. These are not severe but indicate less-than-ideal performance.
   - **Case 1** and **Case 2** may have missed the optional Follow-up Call, but in Case 2 this is overshadowed by more serious violations, and in Case 1 it's a very minor issue since all core rules were followed.

3. **Interpretations/Justifications:**  
   - Case 2 may indicate training or procedural adherence problems.  
   - Case 3’s timing deviations may be due to resource or external constraints rather than intentional noncompliance.

In summary, only Case 2 violates the strict normative rules, while Case 3 fails to meet some recommended but non-mandatory desiderata. Case 1 is fully compliant normatively and meets most desiderata except possibly the recommended follow-up call.
