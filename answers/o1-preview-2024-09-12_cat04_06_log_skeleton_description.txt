The process underlying this data is an employee declaration approval workflow with multiple, mutually exclusive paths, which determines how a declaration is processed based on the type or requirements of the declaration. Here's a detailed description of the process:

**1. Declaration Initiation by Employee:**

- **Option A: Saving the Declaration**
  - The employee starts by creating a declaration.
  - They may choose to save the declaration without submitting it.
  - This is captured by the activity **"Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE"**.
  - If the declaration is saved, it is not submitted for approval in this case.
  - **Constraint Implication:** The "Never Together" constraint between **"Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE"** and **"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"** ensures that a saved declaration is not simultaneously submitted.

- **Option B: Submitting the Declaration**
  - Alternatively, the employee submits the completed declaration.
  - This is represented by the activity **"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"**.
  - **Activity Occurrence:** This activity can occur multiple times (0 to 7 times), allowing for multiple submissions or corrections.
  - **Constraint Implication:** The "Always Before" constraints ensure that any further approval steps occur only after the declaration has been submitted.

**2. Mutually Exclusive Approval Paths:**

Once the declaration is submitted, it enters one of three mutually exclusive approval paths:

- **Path 1: PRE_APPROVER Approval**
  - **Activity:** **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER"**
  - The declaration is sent to a PRE_APPROVER for initial review.
  - **Automatic Rejection for Missing Information:**
    - The **"Declaration REJECTED by MISSING"** activity occurs directly after the declaration is sent for approval.
    - **Constraint Implication:** The "Directly-Follows" and "Always After" constraints indicate that if the declaration is sent to the PRE_APPROVER, it is immediately checked for completeness and may be automatically rejected due to missing information.
  - **Outcome:**
    - If rejected due to missing information, the process may end or return to the employee for correction.
  - **Constraints with Other Paths:**
    - "Never Together" constraints ensure that if the declaration is processed by the PRE_APPROVER, it does not simultaneously go through the SUPERVISOR or ADMINISTRATION approval paths.
    - Payment processing activities like **"Request Payment"** and **"Payment Handled"** do not occur in this path, indicating that declarations approved by PRE_APPROVER do not proceed to payment.

- **Path 2: SUPERVISOR Approval**
  - **Activity:** **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR"**
  - The declaration is sent to a SUPERVISOR for approval.
  - **Automatic Rejection for Missing Information:**
    - Similar to the PRE_APPROVER path, the **"Declaration REJECTED by MISSING"** activity occurs directly after.
    - **Constraint Implication:** The "Directly-Follows" and "Always After" constraints indicate an immediate check for completeness and possible automatic rejection.
  - **Outcome:**
    - The SUPERVISOR may approve or reject the declaration.
    - **"Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"** indicates final approval in this path.
  - **Constraints with Other Paths:**
    - "Never Together" constraints prevent co-occurrence with PRE_APPROVER and ADMINISTRATION approval activities.
    - Like the PRE_APPROVER path, payment processing does not occur here, so declarations approved by SUPERVISOR do not proceed to payment.

- **Path 3: ADMINISTRATION Approval and Payment Processing**
  - **Activity:** **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION"**
  - The declaration is sent directly to the ADMINISTRATION department.
  - **Equivalence of Activities:**
    - The **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION"** activity is equivalent to several other activities:
      - **"Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"**
      - **"Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER"**
      - **"Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION"**
      - **"Request Payment"**
      - **"Payment Handled"**
    - **Constraint Implication:** This equivalence means that when the declaration is sent to ADMINISTRATION, it results in one or more of these activities occurring the same number of times.
  - **Outcome:**
    - If approved, the declaration leads to payment processing:
      - **"Request Payment"** and **"Payment Handled"** activities occur, indicating the initiation and completion of payment.
    - If rejected, **"Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION"** occurs.
  - **Constraints with Other Paths:**
    - "Never Together" constraints prevent the ADMINISTRATION approval path from co-occurring with the PRE_APPROVER or SUPERVISOR paths.

**3. Employee Resubmission:**

- In some cases, after the declaration reaches ADMINISTRATION, it may be sent back to the employee.
- **Activity:** **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION"** followed by **"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"**
- **Constraint Implication:** The "Directly-Follows" constraint suggests that the declaration may be returned to the employee for resubmission if required.

**4. Additional Constraints and Activities:**

- **Rejections by Various Roles:**
  - The process includes possible rejections by different roles at their respective approval stages.
  - Rejections may occur due to missing information or other reasons.
- **Mutually Exclusive Activities:**
  - "Never Together" constraints ensure that certain activities do not occur simultaneously, enforcing the mutual exclusivity of the paths.
- **Activity Occurrences:**
  - The number of times certain activities can occur is bounded, indicating how many times a particular step can happen within a case.
  - For example, **"Request Payment"** and **"Payment Handled"** occur at most once, aligning with the process of handling payment only after final approval.

**Summary:**

The underlying process is a declaration approval workflow where:

- An employee initiates a declaration by either saving or submitting it.
- Upon submission, the declaration follows one of three distinct approval paths:
  - **PRE_APPROVER Path:** Involves initial checks and possible immediate rejection due to missing information. Does not lead to payment processing.
  - **SUPERVISOR Path:** Includes approval or rejection by a supervisor, with possible rejection due to missing information. Also does not lead to payment.
  - **ADMINISTRATION Path:** Leads to final approval, rejection by administration, and if approved, proceeds to payment processing.
- Each path is exclusive, and the constraints ensure that the steps and roles involved in one path do not overlap with those in another.
- This design allows for different types of declarations to be processed appropriately based on their requirements and the necessary approval authorities.

This description aligns with the given declarative constraints, explaining the flow of activities and the structure of the process as indicated by the Log Skeleton process model.
