The Log Skeleton process model you provided represents a workflow for approving requests, potentially for expenses or other types of requests. The process involves several activities, each of which can be in one of several states (e.g., 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION', etc.).

The process begins with an employee submitting a request (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE). The request then goes through a series of approval stages, starting with the administrator (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION). The request can be approved, rejected, or saved by the administrator. If approved, it then moves on to the next stage with the supervisor (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR), who can also approve, reject, or save the request. If the request is rejected at either stage, it may return to a previous stage for revision, depending on the specific constraints in your model.

The process also includes a budget owner, who can approve or reject the request at a later stage (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER or Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER). If the request is rejected by the budget owner, it may return to the supervisor for further action (Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER directly follows Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR).

The process also includes a payment stage, where payment is handled or requested (Payment Handled or Request Payment). This stage may occur after approval by the budget owner or supervisor, depending on the specific constraints.

The process includes several types of rejections, such as rejection by the employee, missing information, or pre-approver. If the request is rejected, it may return to a previous stage for revision or correction.

The process includes several activity occurrences constraints, which specify the maximum number of times each activity can occur in a case. For example, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE can occur 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 times in a case.

The process also includes several direct-follows constraints, which specify that certain activities must occur directly after others. For example, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR must be followed by Declaration REJECTED by MISSING or Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE.

Overall, the process represents a complex workflow for approving requests, with multiple stages and opportunities for revision and correction.
