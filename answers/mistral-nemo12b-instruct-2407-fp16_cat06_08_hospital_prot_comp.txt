Based on the provided data, here are the main differences in patient flow and performance across different pathways in a hospital setting:

1. **Entry Point:**
   - **FD (Fever Clinic) vs ER (Emergency Room):** Most patients first register at FD or ER. The choice depends on the severity of symptoms:
     - FD: Patients with fever or common ailments.
     - ER: Patients with emergencies or severe conditions.

2. **Expert Examination vs Thorough Examination:**
   - **Expert Examination:** Conducted by specialists, often for complex cases or specific complaints (e.g., in FD for malaria, or in ER for trauma).
   - **Thorough Examination:** General physical examination to assess overall health and multiple symptoms (often initial assessment in both FD and ER).

3. **Diagnosis and Treatment:**
   - Some patients are diagnosed and treated successfully on their first attempt (e.g., Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge).
   - Others require multiple rounds of diagnosis and treatment, indicating complex or recurring conditions:
     - Unsuccessful treatment leads to re-diagnosis, further treatment, and potentially another round of unsuccessful treatment.
     - This is more common in pathways involving expert examinations and thorough examinations.

4. **Performance (Time taken in minutes):**
   - Pathways with multiple rounds of diagnosis and treatment take significantly longer:
     - ER Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: ~639,000-640,000 minutes
     - FD Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: ~480,000-640,000 minutes
   - Simple pathways with successful first-time treatment take less time:
     - Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: ~260,000 minutes

5. **Frequency:**
   - Pathways involving fever clinic registration and initial examination have the highest frequency (Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 653 times).
   - Emergency room pathways with expert examinations also have high frequencies but lower than FD initial examinations.

6. **Discharge without treatment:**
   - Some patients are discharged without receiving any treatment (e.g., Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge), suggesting they either didn't need it or their condition couldn't be treated successfully.
