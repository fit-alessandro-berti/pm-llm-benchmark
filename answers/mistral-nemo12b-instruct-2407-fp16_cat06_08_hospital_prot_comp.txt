Based on the provided process variants, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher number of unique process variants (68) compared to the 'unprotected' group (35). This suggests that the 'protected' group may have more complex or varied care needs.
   - Some process variants are much more frequent in one group than the other. For example, 'Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge' is the most frequent variant for the 'unprotected' group (1466 times) but only appears 73 times in the 'protected' group.

2. **Use of Specialists and Diagnostic Tests:**
   - The 'protected' group has more variants involving specialist examinations ('Expert Examination') and thorough examinations, suggesting they might be receiving more specialized or detailed care.
   - However, the 'unprotected' group also has a significant number of these variants, indicating that this is not a clear-cut difference.

3. **Treatment Unsuccessfulness:**
   - The 'unprotected' group has more process variants involving unsuccessful treatments followed by further diagnosis and treatment ('Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment'). This suggests that the 'unprotected' group might have more complex or difficult-to-treat conditions.
   - In contrast, the 'protected' group has fewer variants with this pathway, suggesting their conditions may be easier to treat on average.

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - The performance metrics (labeled as 'performance') seem to vary widely and do not appear to directly correlate with the frequency of process variants or the complexity of treatment pathways.
   - It's unclear what these metrics represent without additional context, but they could potentially indicate differences in resource utilization, length of stay, or other factors.

5. **Discharge Without Treatment:**
   - The 'unprotected' group has a variant ('Discharge') that does not involve any treatment, suggesting that some patients in this group may be discharged without receiving active treatment.
   - This variant is absent from the 'protected' group, which could indicate a difference in care pathways or patient needs.

6. **Registration Points:**
   - The 'protected' group has more variants starting with 'Register at ER', while the 'unprotected' group has more variants starting with 'Register at FD'. This could suggest differences in where patients initially seek care.
   - However, both groups have a significant number of variants involving registration at either location, so this is not a stark difference.
