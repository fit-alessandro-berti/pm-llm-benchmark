Thank you for that detailed overview. I'd like to ask some clarifying questions to better understand the nuances of your property onboarding process:

## **Initial Contact & Documentation Phase**

1. When a landlord first contacts your regional office, what determines which property coordinator handles their request? Is there a rotation system, specialization by property type, or geographic assignment?

2. You mentioned checking for "certificates of compliance with local housing regulations" - how do these requirements vary across your different cities, and how does the coordinator know which specific documents to request for each location?

3. What happens if a landlord's documentation is partially complete but they're eager to list quickly? Can the process proceed conditionally, or must everything be verified before moving forward?

## **Property Manager Assignment**

4. Could you walk me through a specific example of how competing factors (workload, geography, experience, track record) are balanced when assigning a property manager? What takes priority when these factors conflict?

5. How do you define and measure a property manager's "current workload"? Is it based on number of properties, number of units, geographic spread, or something else?

6. What constitutes a "unique requirement" that would influence manager selection, beyond the examples you mentioned?

## **Inspection & Remediation**

7. How much time typically passes between the initial landlord contact and the property inspection? What factors might accelerate or delay this timeline?

8. When inspection issues are found, who decides whether repairs are mandatory versus recommended? How do you handle situations where the landlord disagrees with the inspector's findings?

9. Are there different levels or types of inspections depending on the property type or local regulations? How is this determined?

## **Marketing & Pricing**

10. You mentioned the digital marketing team "updates internal pricing models based on current market trends" - how frequently are these models updated, and what triggers a pricing review for an already-listed property?

11. How do you handle situations where the landlord's expected rental price significantly differs from what your pricing model suggests?

## **Tenant Screening & Selection**

12. When you say the property manager "may negotiate lease terms," what aspects are typically negotiable versus non-negotiable? Who has the authority to approve deviations from standard terms?

13. How do you handle competing applications that arrive at different stages of completeness? For instance, if one applicant has submitted everything but another has only partially applied but seems more qualified?

14. What happens if a selected tenant fails a final verification step after other applicants have been declined?

## **Quality Checks & Compliance**

15. At what points can the compliance officer or financial analyst halt or reverse the onboarding process? What are the most common reasons for intervention?

16. How do you track and ensure that all these parallel quality checks (compliance, financial, IT) are completed before finalizing the onboarding?

## **Communication & Coordination**

17. You mentioned using email, CRMs, and project management tools - how do team members know which channel to use for different types of communication? How is critical information prevented from getting lost across these systems?

18. How do you maintain continuity when key personnel (property manager, coordinator) are unavailable during the onboarding process?

## **Exceptions & Edge Cases**

19. Could you describe a particularly challenging property onboarding scenario you've encountered? How did the standard process need to be adapted?

20. How do you handle properties that need to be onboarded urgently (e.g., a landlord needs to relocate immediately)? What steps can be expedited or done in parallel?

21. What happens when a property is partially through the onboarding process and the landlord decides to withdraw or switch to a competitor?

## **Process Metrics & Improvement**

22. How do you measure the success of a property onboarding? What are the key indicators that tell you it went well versus poorly?

23. What's the typical failure rate at each major stage (documentation, inspection, tenant finding), and what are the most common reasons for these failures?

24. How do you capture and incorporate feedback from landlords about their onboarding experience, especially when they own multiple properties?

These questions should help uncover the detailed decision-making logic, exception paths, and coordination mechanisms that make your process work in practice.
