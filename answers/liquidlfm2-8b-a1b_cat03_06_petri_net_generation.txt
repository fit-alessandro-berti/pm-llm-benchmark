# No active tokens in any place—closed claim final state
for p in net.places:
    fm[p] = 0

# Alternatively, explicitly verify all places are empty:
# Since output marking must represent the closed final state:

### Explanation:
- The Petri net models the sequential flow through claim processing with re-entrant loops for retries on Document Verification (Rev-DV) and multiple Fraud Checks with In-Depth Investigation (II) loops.
- The **initial marking** places one token at the Claim_Arrival place, signaling the claim’s entry.
- The **final marking** assigns zero tokens to all places, indicating closure with no pending work.
- Arcs explicitly connect each step in sequence; the FFD loops on DV and FCII reflect repeated attempts permitted in real claims.
- The net becomes accepting since all paths eventually lead to the final neutral marking.
