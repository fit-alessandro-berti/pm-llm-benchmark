In the model the XOR after **PreliminaryScoring** means that, for some applicants, the process executes **D – CheckLocalAffiliation**, while for everyone else that step is skipped. You described D as giving a “subtle score uplift.” That makes the branch more than a neutral routing decision: it **systematically increases the score of applicants who are local residents / members of a favored community group**, while all other applicants do not get that extra boost.

So the bias is encoded in the structure itself:

- **Applicants with local affiliation** are routed through D  receive a scoring advantage.  
- **Applicants without local affiliation** bypass D  no uplift.

Even though “local affiliation” is not a legally protected attribute, it still functions as a preferential treatment. This can be unfair because:

1. **It is unrelated to credit risk** (local ties are not inherently a measure of repayment ability).  
2. It **creates unequal opportunity**—outsiders, new residents, or people from different communities get systematically worse scores.  
3. It can lead to **indirect discrimination** if local affiliation correlates with protected traits (ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic background).  

**Impact on fairness and equity:**  
Over many decisions, this small uplift can shift borderline cases into approval or better terms, producing higher approval rates for locals and lower rates for nonlocals. That undermines equitable access to credit and can institutionalize favoritism even when no explicit protected category is used.

In short: the XOR branch makes membership in a nonprotected group an informal “bonus,” which biases final decisions and risks inequitable outcomes.
