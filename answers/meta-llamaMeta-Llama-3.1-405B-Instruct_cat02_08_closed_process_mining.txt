Here are the opposite concepts, more general concepts, and explanations for each of the given concepts in the process mining field:

1. **Automated Process Discovery**
	* Opposite concept: **Manual Process Modeling**
		+ In manual process modeling, the process is designed and documented manually by a process expert or stakeholder, without the use of automated discovery techniques.
	* More general concept: **Process Discovery**
		+ Process discovery refers to the broader set of techniques and methods used to identify, document, and analyze business processes, including both automated and manual approaches.
2. **Predictive Monitoring**
	* Opposite concept: **Reactive Monitoring**
		+ Reactive monitoring focuses on detecting and responding to problems or deviations after they have occurred, rather than predicting and preventing them.
	* More general concept: **Business Process Monitoring**
		+ Business process monitoring encompasses a range of techniques and tools used to track, analyze, and improve business processes, including both predictive and reactive approaches.
3. **Bottom-up Discovery**
	* Opposite concept: **Top-down Modeling**
		+ Top-down modeling involves designing a process model from a high-level perspective, starting with the overall process goals and working down to the detailed activities.
	* More general concept: **Process Modeling**
		+ Process modeling refers to the creation of a graphical representation of a business process, which can be done using various approaches, including bottom-up discovery, top-down modeling, and hybrid approaches.
4. **Process Simulation**
	* Opposite concept: **Static Process Analysis**
		+ Static process analysis involves analyzing a process model or documentation without simulating its behavior or performance.
	* More general concept: **Business Process Analysis**
		+ Business process analysis encompasses a range of techniques and tools used to examine, understand, and improve business processes, including both simulation and static analysis approaches.
5. **Process Efficiency**
	* Opposite concept: **Process Inefficiency**
		+ Process inefficiency refers to the waste, redundancy, or suboptimal performance of a business process, resulting in unnecessary costs, time, or resources.
	* More general concept: **Business Process Performance**
		+ Business process performance refers to the overall effectiveness and efficiency of a business process in achieving its goals and objectives, encompassing both efficiency and inefficiency aspects.
6. **Real-time Monitoring**
	* Opposite concept: **Offline Analysis**
		+ Offline analysis involves examining process data and performance after the fact, rather than in real-time.
	* More general concept: **Business Process Visibility**
		+ Business process visibility refers to the ability to observe, track, and understand business processes, including both real-time monitoring and offline analysis approaches.

These opposite concepts and more general concepts can help to provide a more nuanced understanding of the process mining field and the various techniques and approaches used to analyze and improve business processes.
