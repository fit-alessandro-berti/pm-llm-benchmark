The provided visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that outlines the workflow for dispatching goods from a Computer Hardware Shop. The process is divided into three main sections: Logistics, Secretary, and Warehouse.

Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

1. **Start Event**: The process begins with the "Ship goods" start event.

2. **Clarify Shipment Method**:
   - The first task is to "Clarify shipment method."
   - There is a decision point to check if special handling is required.
     - If special handling is not required, the process moves to the next step.
     - If special handling is required, the process branches to get offers from logistic companies.

3. **Get Offers from Logistic Companies**:
   - If special handling is required, the process gets offers from logistic companies.
   - After getting offers, the process selects a logistic company and places an order.

4. **Check if Insurance is Required**:
   - The process checks if insurance is required based on customer information.
     - If insurance is required, the parcel is insured.
     - If insurance is not required, the process moves to the next step.

5. **Write Package Label**:
   - The package label is written.
   - The process then moves to the warehouse section.

6. **Package Goods**:
   - In the warehouse, the goods are packaged.
   - There is a timer event set for 48 hours.
     - If the packaging is not completed within 48 hours, the customer is notified about the delay.

7. **Fill Out Shipment Paperwork**:
   - Once the goods are packaged, the shipment paperwork is filled out.

8. **Move Package to Pickup Area**:
   - The package is moved to the pickup area.

9. **End Event**: The process ends with the "Shipment prepared" end event.

The diagram uses standard BPMN symbols:
- Start and End Events are represented by circles.
- Tasks are represented by rectangles.
- Decision points are represented by diamonds.
- Gateways are represented by hexagons.
- Data objects are represented by cylinders.

This diagram provides a clear and structured overview of the steps involved in dispatching goods from a Computer Hardware Shop, including decision points and potential delays.
