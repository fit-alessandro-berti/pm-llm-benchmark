# Process Mining-Driven Resource Assignment Optimization for TechSolve Solutions

## Executive Summary

TechSolve Solutions faces a critical challenge common among growing IT service desk operations: the gap between their intended resource assignment logic and the actual workflow patterns that emerge when human agents interact with complex, variable ticket streams. The symptoms—increasing SLA breaches for P2 and P3 tickets, excessive reassignments, and misaligned skill utilization—point to systemic issues in how incidents are matched to support personnel. This analysis presents a comprehensive framework leveraging process mining techniques to diagnose resource-related inefficiencies, identify root causes, and implement data-driven assignment strategies that optimize both operational efficiency and service quality.

The event log data captured over the past year provides an unprecedented view into the actual behaviors, bottlenecks, and decision patterns that drive TechSolve's performance. By applying rigorous process mining methodologies to this data, we can move beyond symptomatic treatment to address the fundamental design flaws in the current assignment system. The recommendations that follow are grounded in empirical evidence from the logs, focused on actionable improvements, and designed for measurable impact on the key performance indicators that matter most to TechSolve's stakeholders.

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1 Agent and Tier Performance Metrics

The foundation of any process mining-driven improvement initiative begins with establishing a comprehensive metrics framework that captures both the efficiency and effectiveness of resource utilization. For TechSolve's multi-tiered support structure, this requires developing distinct metric sets for each tier while maintaining consistency that enables cross-tier comparison and analysis.

**Individual Agent Performance Metrics** form the granular layer of analysis. For each agent in the event log, we would construct a performance profile encompassing multiple dimensions. Workload distribution metrics would track the total number of tickets handled, the sum of processing time, and the distribution across ticket priorities and categories. This analysis immediately addresses the observation that "some agents consistently overloaded while others appear underutilized" by providing empirical evidence of workload variance. The metric should calculate not just raw ticket counts but weighted values that account for ticket complexity—P1 tickets, for instance, might be weighted at four times P4 tickets to reflect the differential resource investment they require.

Processing time metrics require careful decomposition into active handling time versus waiting time. The event log's timestamp types (START, COMPLETE) enable this separation, revealing agents who spend significant time waiting for responses versus those who actively troubleshoot. An agent with high total time but low active handling time likely faces systemic delays rather than individual inefficiency. First-call resolution rate for L1 agents emerges as a critical effectiveness metric, calculated by identifying tickets where "Work L1 End" indicates resolution rather than escalation. This metric, correlated against agent skills and ticket categories, reveals whether L1 agents are being appropriately utilized within their capability scope or consistently operating beyond their effective reach.

Skill-specific performance metrics track how effectively each agent applies their documented skill sets. For agents possessing "App-CRM" skills, we would measure the resolution rate for CRM-related tickets, the average handling time for such tickets, and the escalation rate compared to agents without this skill. Disparities here signal either skill profile inaccuracies or training gaps that prevent agents from fully leveraging their capabilities.

**Tier-Level Aggregation** provides the strategic view of support structure performance. L1 metrics should focus on deflection rate (tickets resolved without escalation), average handling time before escalation decision, and the accuracy of escalation decisions (measured by whether the receiving L2/L3 agent successfully resolves the ticket or requires further escalation). L2 and L3 tier metrics emphasize resolution rate for escalated tickets, average time to resolution post-escalation, and the frequency of reassignments within the tier. The reassignment metric is particularly telling—a high internal reassignment rate within L2 suggests either skill matching problems at the point of escalation or workload imbalances among L2 specialists.

### 1.2 Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Discovery

Process mining offers a sophisticated toolkit for extracting hidden patterns from TechSolve's event log that would be impossible to identify through traditional operational reporting. The transition from the intended round-robin and manual escalation model to the actual patterns occurring in practice requires several complementary mining approaches.

**Resource Interaction Analysis** maps the actual communication and handover patterns between agents, tiers, and the dispatcher. By constructing a process model annotated with resource information, we can visualize not just what activities occur but who performs them and in what sequence. The "Escalate L2" and "Assign L2" activities in the event log represent critical handover points where assignment quality directly impacts downstream performance. Mining these transitions reveals whether escalations follow the intended path (L1  Dispatcher  L2 based on skill matching) or deviate through informal reassignments, self-escalations, or cascading handovers between specialists.

This analysis would likely reveal patterns such as certain L1 agents consistently escalating to specific L2 specialists regardless of skill requirements, suggesting personal relationships or habit rather than optimal matching. Alternatively, we might discover that L2 specialists with "App-CRM" skills receive disproportionate volumes of Network-related escalations, indicating that the dispatcher lacks visibility into specialist skill profiles or that initial ticket categorization misidentifies the underlying issue.

**Social Network Analysis based on Handovers** treats the agent ecosystem as a social graph where edges represent ticket transfers, escalations, or collaborative problem-solving. Metrics including betweenness centrality (which agents lie on the most critical paths through the network), closeness centrality (who can reach the most other agents most efficiently), and clustering coefficients (cliques of agents who frequently work together) reveal the informal organizational structure that emerges from actual work patterns. A highly centralized network where one or two agents serve as hubs for most escalations indicates both a bottleneck risk and an opportunity to redistribute expertise more broadly.

Comparing this mined social network to the formal organizational hierarchy exposes disconnects. If L1 agents in the social network frequently bypass the dispatcher to directly engage specific L2 specialists, the formal assignment process exists on paper but not in practice. This finding would suggest that either the dispatcher process adds no value, the direct connections represent faster paths that agents rationally prefer, or cultural factors encourage informal routing that undermines systematic assignment.

**Role Discovery Algorithms** such as the Fuzzy Miner or the Heuristic Miner with role extraction can automatically identify behavioral clusters among agents. Rather than assuming that all L1 agents behave similarly, mining might reveal distinct L1 subtypes: "Quick Escalators" who immediately involve specialists, "Troubleshooters" who attempt extensive resolution before escalation, "Specialists" who handle particular ticket types with unusual effectiveness despite being classified as generalists, and "Bottlenecks" whose tickets consistently delay downstream. Similarly, L2 agents might cluster into "Generalists" who handle diverse categories but with moderate success, "Specialists" who excel in narrow domains but struggle outside them, and "Overload Candidates" whose patterns indicate they receive tickets they cannot resolve.

This role discovery directly informs assignment optimization by providing evidence-based agent groupings that reflect actual capability patterns rather than assumed tier classifications. An L1 agent who consistently resolves complex Network tickets might be misclassified and should receive higher-complexity assignments, while an L2 specialist whose "App-CRM" skill appears underutilized might be incorrectly perceived as unavailable for CRM escalations.

### 1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis

The most critical analysis for TechSolve's assignment problems focuses on the alignment between ticket requirements and agent capabilities. The event log's "Required Skill" field, combined with agent skill profiles, enables a comprehensive assessment of skill utilization efficiency.

**Skill Demand Profiling** aggregates ticket requirements over the analysis period to construct a demand curve for each skill category. This reveals which skills face the highest volume (likely "Basic-Troubleshoot" given L1's generalist nature), which experience peak demand periods, and which show growth trends that might necessitate hiring or training investments. The "Networking-Firewall" skill appearing in the sample log for a P2 ticket represents high-complexity work that should reach specialists quickly; analyzing how often this skill requirement actually reaches qualified agents versus spending time with generalists first quantifies the cost of current assignment practices.

**Skill Supply Analysis** maps agent capabilities against demand to identify gaps and surpluses. For each skill category, we calculate the total agent-hours available (agents possessing the skill multiplied by working time), the total ticket-hours required (tickets requiring the skill multiplied by average handling time), and the utilization rate. A skill with demand exceeding supply explains bottlenecks, while a skill with supply significantly exceeding demand suggests over-investment or misallocation. The ideal state shows rough equilibrium where qualified agents remain productively engaged without creating queues.

**Overqualification and Underqualization Metrics** measure the matching quality. Overqualization occurs when agents with advanced skills handle tickets requiring only basic skills—specialists doing generalist work. The sample log's observation that "L2/L3 specialists report spending time on tasks that could potentially be handled by L1" points directly to this issue. Quantification involves identifying tickets where the assigned agent's skill level substantially exceeds requirements, calculating the percentage of specialist time consumed by such tickets, and estimating the opportunity cost (what more valuable work those hours could have produced).

Conversely, underqualization occurs when agents without the required skills receive tickets they cannot ultimately resolve, leading to reassignments or escalations. This metric captures not just initial assignment errors but also cases where skill requirements are incorrectly identified at ticket creation, only to be corrected after the ticket has spent time with an unqualified agent. The "Reassign" activity in the sample log, where Agent B12 determines the ticket "Needs different skill (DB)," exemplifies underqualization that wasted L2 time before reaching appropriate resources.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### 2.1 Bottleneck Identification Methodology

Transforming the analytical framework into specific, actionable problem identification requires a structured methodology that connects observed symptoms to root causes through empirical evidence from the event log. For TechSolve, this methodology focuses on four categories of resource-related bottlenecks that manifest in the SLA breach and reassignment patterns.

**Skill-Based Bottlenecks** emerge when demand for specific skills consistently exceeds capacity, creating queues that delay ticket resolution regardless of overall agent availability. Identification involves constructing skill-specific queue metrics: for each skill category, track the time tickets spend waiting for an agent with matching skills versus the time spent being actively handled. A high ratio indicates that the bottleneck is availability of qualified agents rather than complexity of the work itself. For TechSolve's P2 and P3 SLA breaches, this analysis would reveal whether the failures stem from insufficient specialists for high-priority categories or from general capacity constraints that affect all tickets equally.

The impact quantification for skill bottlenecks calculates the average delay attributable to skill unavailability. If tickets requiring "Networking-Firewall" skills spend an average of 45 minutes waiting for qualified agents versus 12 minutes for "Basic-Troubleshoot" tickets, and if 30% of P2 tickets require Firewall skills, we can estimate the SLA impact as approximately (45-12) * 0.30 = 9.9 minutes of average delay explained by this single skill bottleneck. This empirical measurement provides the business case for skill investment or reassignment optimization.

**Escalation Delay Bottlenecks** focus on the transitions between tiers where tickets accumulate while waiting for assignment or for the next tier to begin work. The event log's sequential timestamps enable precise measurement of these intervals. For each escalation event, we calculate the elapsed time between "Escalate L2" and "Assign L2" (dispatcher delay), between "Assign L2" and "Work L2 Start" (agent selection delay), and between "Work L2 Start" and resolution. The first two intervals represent pure waiting time that adds no value—the ticket is escalated but not yet being worked.

Analysis of the sample log reveals a 29-minute gap between escalation and L2 work start for INC-1001 (09:36:00 to 10:05:50), with only 4 minutes of that attributable to dispatcher assignment and the remaining 25 minutes representing queue delay before Agent B12 began working. This pattern, if consistent, identifies a capacity constraint at the L2 tier that causes tickets to wait after formal assignment. Quantifying this across all escalations establishes whether the bottleneck occurs in the assignment process itself or in the receiving tier's capacity to accept new work.

**Reassignment Cascades** represent a particularly costly pattern where tickets bounce between agents or tiers without progressing toward resolution. Each reassignment introduces overhead: context-switching time for the receiving agent, potential duplicate troubleshooting efforts, and accumulated waiting time. Identification involves tracing ticket paths through the event log to detect multiple reassignment events within short timeframes. A ticket with "Assign L2"  "Reassign"  "Assign L2" sequences has experienced at least one unnecessary handoff.

The impact calculation for reassignments attributes a fixed cost per reassignment (empirically estimated from the log as the average time between reassignment and next activity start) plus the resolution risk that each handoff introduces. If reassigned tickets show a 25% higher ultimate resolution time than directly assigned tickets with similar characteristics, the multiplier effect compounds the direct costs. Applying this analysis to TechSolve's reassignment frequency provides a cost estimate that can justify investment in better initial assignment logic.

### 2.2 Impact Analysis of Assignment Failures

Moving beyond identification to impact quantification creates the business case for improvement initiatives and prioritizes intervention efforts. For TechSolve's observed symptoms, we establish causal connections between assignment patterns and SLA outcomes.

**SLA Breach Correlation Analysis** applies statistical methods to the event log to identify which assignment factors most strongly predict SLA violations. Variables including initial assignee tier, skill match quality at assignment, agent workload at assignment time, time-of-day and day-of-week, ticket category, and priority are tested for correlation with SLA breach outcomes. Logistic regression or decision tree classification can identify the combination of factors that produce breach predictions with acceptable accuracy.

The analysis might reveal, for example, that P3 tickets assigned to L1 agents without the required skill have a 45% SLA breach rate, while P3 tickets with skill-matched L1 assignment have only an 18% breach rate—a differential directly attributable to assignment quality. Alternatively, the analysis might show that time-of-day has stronger predictive power than skill matching, suggesting that capacity constraints during peak periods drive breaches regardless of assignment sophistication. These findings direct improvement efforts toward the factors with the greatest actual impact rather than assumed priorities.

**Workload Inequality Quantification** addresses the observation of uneven agent utilization. The Gini coefficient or other inequality metrics applied to per-agent workload measurements provide aggregate inequality indices that can be tracked over time. If inequality is increasing even as average workload remains stable, redistribution programs might equalize utilization without requiring headcount changes. The analysis also identifies specific agents at both extremes: "Superstars" who handle disproportionate ticket volumes and may be at burnout risk, and "Underutilized" agents whose skills and availability are being wasted.

Breaking workload analysis by ticket characteristics reveals whether inequality reflects intentional specialization (appropriate) or random assignment variation (problematic). If the highest-workload agents all share responsibility for P1 tickets, their elevated volume appropriately reflects priority weighting. If their workload includes disproportionate P4 low-priority work while others handle more complex tickets, the assignment system is misallocating work regardless of agent preference or capability.

### 2.3 Agent Performance Diagnostics

**Overloaded Agent Identification** combines workload metrics with outcome metrics to distinguish between productive high performers and agents who are overwhelmed to the point of reduced effectiveness. An agent handling 150% of average ticket volume but maintaining resolution rates and handling times at or above baseline is likely a high performer whose capacity should be expanded through support or recognition. An agent handling 150% of average volume but showing increasing handling times, elevated reassignment rates, and declining resolution quality is overloaded and producing lower-quality output despite higher effort.

The event log enables this distinction through trend analysis within individual agent performance. A suddenly increasing handling time trend for an agent whose workload also increased suggests overload effects; stable handling time despite workload increase suggests effective adaptation. Resolution quality trends—measured by whether the agent's tickets require escalation or reassignment—indicate whether the agent is successfully completing work or simply passing problems downstream.

**Underperforming Agent Diagnosis** requires careful differentiation between agent-level factors (skill gaps, training needs, motivation issues) and assignment factors (receiving inappropriate tickets, working during constraint periods, lacking necessary tools). An agent with poor resolution rates for a specific category might genuinely lack skills—or might consistently receive that category's most complex tickets while colleagues handle routine cases. Comparative analysis of agent performance on identical or similar ticket types controls for assignment variation and isolates true capability differences.

The diagnostic framework also identifies agents who create downstream costs through poor escalation decisions. If a specific L1 agent's escalations consistently reach L2 specialists who must further escalate or reassign, that agent may be escalating inappropriately—either sending cases that L1 could resolve or routing to the wrong specialist tier. Conversely, if another L1 agent rarely escalates but their non-escalated tickets show high reopen rates or customer escalations to management, they may be failing to recognize when escalation is warranted.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Systematic Analysis of Assignment Decision Failures

Understanding why assignment failures occur requires moving beyond surface symptoms to examine the decision-making processes, information systems, and organizational factors that produce suboptimal matching between tickets and agents. The event log captures the outcomes of these decisions but not their logic; reconstructing the decision context requires correlating assignment patterns with the information available to decision-makers at the time.

**Decision Point Analysis** maps each assignment event to the information available to the decision-maker. For dispatcher assignments, what ticket information, agent skill profiles, and workload data were visible? For self-assignments by L1 agents (as with Agent A02 in the sample log), what prompted that particular agent to claim the ticket? For escalations, what triggered the escalation decision and how was the escalation target selected? Reconstructing these decision contexts reveals whether failures stem from missing information, incorrect information, or poor decision logic applied to available information.

A dispatcher who assigns a ticket requiring "Database-SQL" skills to an agent without that skill might have lacked access to current skill profiles, might have had outdated profiles showing the agent as SQL-qualified, or might have had accurate information but prioritized workload balancing over skill matching. Each root cause requires a different intervention: system integration for missing information, data governance for profile accuracy, or policy changes for priority conflicts.

**Variant Analysis** systematically compares cases with successful assignment patterns against those experiencing failures. Successful cases show efficient progression from ticket creation through resolution with minimal reassignments and consistent skill matching. Failed cases show the problematic patterns: multiple reassignments, skill mismatches, extended waiting, or eventual SLA breach. By extracting the distinguishing characteristics of successful versus failed cases, we identify the factors that predict assignment success.

The technical implementation of variant analysis uses process mining techniques to discover the "happy path" model (the most common successful variant) and contrast it with the "unhappy path" models that lead to failures. Decision mining algorithms can extract the rules that distinguish successful assignments: "When Category=Network and Priority=P2 and Requestor=External, assign to Agent B08" type patterns that represent the implicit logic successful dispatchers apply. Comparing these extracted rules against the official assignment policy reveals whether agents are following intended logic, applying better informal heuristics, or making arbitrary decisions.

### 3.2 Contributing Organizational Factors

**Skill Profile Accuracy Assessment** examines whether the documented agent skills in the event log accurately represent actual capabilities. If agents frequently receive tickets requiring skills they ostensibly possess but consistently fail to resolve those tickets (as measured by eventual escalation or reassignment), their skill profiles likely overstate their abilities. Conversely, if agents successfully resolve tickets requiring skills not in their profiles, the profiles understate their capabilities and represent an assignment constraint that artificially limits the effective workforce.

The analysis quantifies profile accuracy through reconciliation between documented skills and resolution outcomes. For each agent-skill combination in their profile, calculate the resolution rate for tickets requiring that skill. A low resolution rate for a documented skill suggests either the agent genuinely lacks the skill, requires training, or should not be assigned that skill type. For skills not in an agent's profile but appearing on tickets they successfully resolved, the agent may be self-trained or the skill may not require formal certification—valuable information for updating profiles to reflect actual capabilities.

**Initial Categorization Quality** addresses the upstream accuracy of ticket attributes that drive assignment decisions. If tickets frequently change "Required Skill" values as they progress through the process (from initial assignment through escalations and reassignments), the initial categorization may be incorrect. INC-1001 in the sample log shows this pattern: initially categorized for "App-CRM" work, it was reassigned because it "Needs different skill (DB)," suggesting either that the original category was wrong or that troubleshooting revealed a different underlying issue.

The cost of categorization errors compounds through the assignment chain. An incorrectly categorized ticket routes to an agent without the ultimately-required skill, wastes time before escalation, introduces delay, and ultimately requires reassignment anyway. Quantifying this cost—average time from creation to correct skill identification—establishes the value proposition for improving initial categorization through better tools, training, or automated prediction.

**Visibility and Information Flow Gaps** examine what information was available to decision-makers at assignment points versus what information would have improved decisions. If dispatchers assign tickets without real-time visibility into agent availability and workload, they cannot implement workload-aware assignment even if they recognize its importance. If L1 agents escalating to L2 cannot specify why they are choosing a particular specialist, they default to familiar names or convenient availability rather than optimal matching.

The gap analysis interviews decision-makers to understand their information environment, then compares to the information present in the event log. Often, valuable information exists in the log (agent skills, ticket characteristics, timestamps) but is not made available at decision points through user interfaces or system integrations. The gap between "what we know" and "what we show at decision time" defines system and interface improvement opportunities.

### 3.3 Policy and Process Design Deficiencies

**Round-Robin Limitations Analysis** examines whether the stated round-robin assignment logic within tiers is actually being followed and whether it would be effective if it were. If assignment sequences show deviations from strict rotation, the round-robin policy may be overridden by manual intervention, bypassed by self-assignment, or inconsistently implemented across different ticket sources (web, phone, email). Even if correctly implemented, round-robin assignment ignores critical factors: skill requirements, current workload, past performance on similar tickets, and priority differences that should affect sequencing.

The analysis quantifies how often the ideal round-robin sequence would have produced a different assignment than the actual assignment, and how often that difference correlates with outcome variations. If round-robin assignments that happen to match skills outperform those that don't, skill-based assignment would improve outcomes. If round-robin assignments during high-workload periods perform worse than during low-workload periods regardless of skill matching, workload-aware assignment would help.

**Escalation Threshold Misalignment** examines whether L1 agents are escalating at appropriate points. Excessive escalation overwhelms L2/L3 capacity and wastes specialist time on cases L1 could resolve. Insufficient escalation delays resolution when L1 works beyond their effective scope. The optimal escalation threshold balances these concerns based on actual resolution probabilities and cost structures.

Mining historical escalation patterns reveals whether L1 agents escalate at consistent thresholds or whether thresholds vary widely across agents. If some agents escalate 80% of their tickets while others escalate only 20%, there is no shared understanding of appropriate escalation criteria. Correlating escalation rates with ultimate resolution outcomes identifies whether high-escalation agents are appropriately recognizing complex cases or inappropriately avoiding difficult troubleshooting. Low-escalation agents with poor non-escalation resolution rates are failing to recognize when specialist help is needed; those with good non-escalation rates may be unnecessarily referring cases that they could resolve themselves.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### 4.1 Strategy One: Intelligent Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

This strategy directly addresses the core problem of matching ticket requirements to agent capabilities by implementing a routing algorithm that considers both skill presence and demonstrated proficiency. The fundamental insight driving this strategy is that agent skill profiles should reflect not just capability existence but effectiveness level, enabling more nuanced matching decisions.

**Problem Addressed**: The current assignment system, whether round-robin or dispatcher-based, does not systematically match tickets to agents based on skill requirements. The result is frequent skill mismatches—specialists handling routine work, generalists struggling with specialized tickets—that create the reassignments, delays, and SLA breaches TechSolve observes. INC-1001's journey from Agent A05 to Agent B12 to Agent B15 exemplifies the cost of skill mismatches: three agents touched a ticket that could have reached the correct specialist directly if initial routing had considered skill requirements.

**Implementation Approach**: The strategy requires building a skill proficiency scoring system that moves beyond binary skill presence/absence to continuous proficiency scores. For each agent-skill combination, the score reflects historical resolution rates, handling times, and customer feedback for tickets requiring that skill. An agent with 95% resolution rate and 20-minute average handling time for CRM tickets scores higher than an agent with 75% resolution rate and 45-minute average—more proficient agents should handle more tickets requiring that skill.

At assignment time, the system ranks available agents who possess the required skill by their proficiency score, weighted by current workload to prevent overloading high performers. The highest-scoring agent with acceptable workload receives the assignment. This creates a natural feedback loop: high proficiency scores attract more assignments, which generate more outcomes that maintain or improve scores, while lower-scoring agents receive fewer assignments but can improve scores through training or experience.

**Data Requirements**: Implementing this strategy requires three data streams. First, historical outcome data linking agent assignments to resolution outcomes provides the foundation for proficiency scoring. The event log provides this retrospectively, but ongoing collection must continue post-implementation to maintain current scores. Second, skill profile data must be updated from annual reviews to continuous assessment, incorporating new certifications, training completions, and observed performance. Third, real-time workload data from the ticketing system must feed the assignment algorithm to prevent assignment of tickets to agents already at capacity.

**Expected Benefits**: Simulation modeling (addressed in Section 5) projects significant improvements across key metrics. First-call resolution at L1 should improve as tickets reaching L1 are more likely to match available skills. Escalation rates should decrease because L1 agents receiving skill-matched tickets resolve more successfully. L2/L3 specialists should see reduced handling of below-skill-level tickets as those tickets route to appropriately-skilled L1 agents. Resolution times should decrease due to reduced reassignment frequency and improved initial matching quality. SLA compliance should improve as tickets spend less time waiting for qualified agents and more time being actively resolved by capable hands.

### 4.2 Strategy Two: Workload-Balanced Queue Management with Predictive Overflow

This strategy addresses the observation of uneven workload distribution by implementing a real-time workload visibility system that actively balances queue depths across agents and tiers. The fundamental insight is that assignment decisions should consider not just agent capability but agent current state—how many tickets are already waiting, how much work is in progress, and when capacity will become available.

**Problem Addressed**: TechSolve's agents experience uneven utilization despite apparently similar workloads because the assignment system lacks visibility into current state. When a high-volume period hits, tickets accumulate in some agents' queues while others sit idle because assignments arrived during different time windows. The symptom—some agents consistently overloaded while others appear underutilized—reflects assignment timing luck rather than true capacity differences. This imbalance creates delays for tickets in overloaded queues while underutilized agents have capacity that remains unused.

**Implementation Approach**: The strategy implements a centralized queue management system with real-time visibility into all agent states. Each agent's queue depth (tickets waiting plus tickets in progress) updates continuously as tickets arrive and complete. When a new ticket requires assignment, the system calculates not just which agent is most qualified but which agent has the lowest current workload, applying a load-balancing algorithm that prevents any agent from exceeding a configurable threshold above the team average.

For tickets that would exceed the threshold even for the least-loaded qualified agent, the strategy implements predictive overflow routing to the next tier. Rather than adding to an already-overloaded L1 queue, such tickets route directly to L2 specialists who have capacity, accepting the higher-tier cost as preferable to queuing delay. This requires confidence that L2 can handle the ticket (either through general capability or skill matching), but prevents the P2/P3 SLA breaches that occur when tickets wait in overloaded queues.

The system also implements workload forecasting based on historical patterns, enabling proactive redistribution before queues become critical. If patterns suggest that ticket volume will increase in 30 minutes based on time-of-day models, the system can begin throttling L1 assignments slightly to build capacity reserve, or alert agents that a busy period is approaching.

**Data Requirements**: Real-time queue depth data requires integration with the ticketing system to track ticket state (waiting, in progress, completed) for each agent continuously. Historical pattern data feeds the forecasting models, requiring at least several months of timestamped event data to establish reliable patterns. Assignment outcome data enables tuning the load-balancing thresholds—how much imbalance is acceptable before triggering overflow—to optimize the trade-off between perfect balance and the overhead of frequent rebalancing.

**Expected Benefits**: Workload equalization should reduce the variance in agent utilization while maintaining or improving total throughput. Agents currently overloaded should see reduced stress and improved work quality; those currently underutilized should receive more assignments and greater contribution. Queue wait times should decrease as tickets no longer accumulate behind individual agents but distribute across available capacity. SLA compliance should improve for tickets currently delayed by queue congestion, particularly during peak periods when current imbalance effects are most pronounced.

### 4.3 Strategy Three: Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Content Analysis

This strategy addresses the upstream problem of initial ticket categorization and skill requirement identification by applying natural language processing and machine learning to ticket descriptions, enabling prediction of required skills and complexity before human categorization occurs. The fundamental insight is that the text customers and L1 agents use to describe problems contains signal about required resources that current systems ignore.

**Problem Addressed**: Tickets enter TechSolve's system with categorization based on initial assessment—often by the customer (for web submissions) or by the first L1 agent to encounter the ticket (for phone submissions). This initial categorization determines routing and frequently proves inaccurate, as INC-1001 demonstrates with its shift from "App-CRM" to "Database-SQL" requirement. Inaccurate initial categorization propagates through the assignment chain, creating the reassignments and delays that degrade performance. Improving initial categorization accuracy would reduce downstream assignment errors.

**Implementation Approach**: The strategy implements a machine learning pipeline that analyzes ticket description text (and potentially subject lines, conversation threads, and resolution notes) to predict multiple attributes: required skill category, estimated complexity, likely priority (before formal prioritization), and recommended tier for initial assignment. The model trains on historical tickets where outcomes are known—tickets that ultimately required "Database-SQL" skills, tickets that escalated to L3 versus resolved at L2, tickets that breached SLA versus those that completed comfortably.

At ticket creation, the predictive model generates probabilities for each attribute, which the assignment algorithm incorporates alongside agent skills and current workload. A ticket whose text suggests database issues and high complexity receives different treatment than one suggesting simple configuration questions, even if both arrive with identical initial categorization. The system can also identify tickets where its prediction confidence is low, routing these to human dispatchers for careful assignment rather than automated processing.

The model requires ongoing retraining as ticket patterns evolve. New applications, new issue types, and changing user behaviors shift the relationship between text and requirements. A drift detection system monitors prediction accuracy over time and triggers retraining when degradation exceeds thresholds.

**Data Requirements**: Historical ticket data with text content and resolved attributes provides training data for the predictive models. The event log's "Notes" field and the full conversation history (not included in the snippet but assumed to exist in the complete log) enable training on the relationship between description and outcome. Ongoing data collection must capture both text and resolved attributes for tickets currently being processed to support continuous model improvement. Integration with the ticketing system must enable real-time text analysis and prediction at ticket creation.

**Expected Benefits**: Initial categorization accuracy should improve as algorithmic prediction supplements or replaces human assessment. Reassignment frequency should decrease because tickets reach agents with appropriate skills more often on first assignment. Resolution time should improve for tickets currently delayed by categorization-related detours. L1 agent productivity may increase if they receive tickets whose difficulty matches their capabilities more consistently, reducing time spent on cases beyond their skill level.

### 4.4 Strategy Four: Dynamic Tier Resource Allocation Based on Demand Patterns

This strategy addresses the structural problem of fixed tier boundaries that may not match actual demand patterns by implementing flexible resource allocation that shifts agents between tiers based on real-time queue depths and historical demand forecasts. The fundamental insight is that tier assignment should reflect current workload distribution rather than permanent organizational designations.

**Problem Addressed**: TechSolve's tier structure assumes a relatively stable distribution of tickets appropriate for each tier: most tickets resolved at L1, some escalated to L2, fewer still to L3. However, demand patterns may diverge significantly from this assumption. If a surge of complex Network tickets exceeds L2 capacity while L1 handles routine matters with capacity to spare, the rigid tier structure creates L2 bottlenecks while L1 sits underutilized. The current structure cannot flex to match demand variation, whether hourly, daily, or seasonal.

**Implementation Approach**: The strategy implements a dynamic tier management system that monitors queue depths and resolution rates across tiers and initiates resource reallocation when thresholds are exceeded. When L2 queue depth exceeds a high-water mark while L1 has capacity available, the system can temporarily reassign qualified L1 agents to handle L2 work, effectively expanding L2 capacity until the surge passes.

This requires identifying L1 agents with skills valuable to L2, potentially including agents who have demonstrated capability through past successful escalations or who possess relevant certifications. The system tracks which L1 agents have successfully handled tickets that would otherwise escalate, building a shadow skill profile of "L1 agents who can handle L2 work." These agents become the overflow pool when L2 capacity is exceeded.

Reallocation decisions factor in the L1 agent's current workload, the impact on L1 queue depth, and the predicted duration of the L2 surge. For short spikes, temporary reallocation may resolve the queue before L1 impact becomes significant. For sustained periods, more aggressive reallocation or escalation to management for staffing decisions becomes appropriate.

**Data Requirements**: Real-time queue monitoring across all tiers provides the trigger data for reallocation decisions. Historical demand patterns establish baseline expectations and enable forecasting of surge duration. Agent skill profiles extended with "potential tier" capabilities identify which agents can contribute to higher tiers. Outcome tracking validates that reallocated agents maintain quality standards when handling more complex work.

**Expected Benefits**: Queue delays at constrained tiers should decrease as overflow capacity becomes available. Overall throughput should improve as system-wide capacity utilization increases. SLA compliance should improve for tickets currently delayed by tier-specific bottlenecks. Agent satisfaction may improve as high-performing L1 agents gain exposure to more complex work, while L2 specialists spend less time on routine matters that L1 could handle.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1 Business Process Simulation for Strategy Evaluation

Before implementing any of the proposed assignment strategies, TechSolve should validate their projected benefits and identify potential unintended consequences through business process simulation. Simulation enables testing "what-if" scenarios with the proposed assignment logic against historical data, providing confidence that improvements will materialize and identifying edge cases that require refinement.

**Model Construction** begins with importing the event log into a process mining or simulation tool to generate a baseline process model. This model captures the current process flows, their relative frequencies, the resource assignments that occurred, and the outcome metrics achieved. The baseline model serves as the validation standard—simulation of the baseline should reproduce observed metrics (throughput times, SLA breach rates, reassignment frequencies) within acceptable variance, confirming that the model accurately represents reality.

**Scenario Development** creates modified versions of the baseline model incorporating each proposed strategy. For the skill-based routing strategy, the scenario modifies assignment decision rules to select agents based on skill proficiency scores weighted by current workload. For the workload-balancing strategy, the scenario implements queue-depth awareness and load equalization. Each strategy requires translating its logic into simulation parameters and decision rules that the model can execute.

**Experimental Design** tests multiple scenarios and combinations. Individual strategy testing isolates the impact of each improvement; combination testing explores synergies (e.g., skill-based routing combined with workload balancing may outperform either alone). Sensitivity analysis varies key parameters (skill weighting factors, load-balancing thresholds, overflow trigger points) to identify optimal configurations. Edge case testing deliberately stresses the system with unusual demand patterns to identify failure modes.

**Output Analysis** compares scenario results against the baseline across all relevant metrics. For each strategy, we assess whether projected benefits materialize, what the magnitude of improvement appears to be, which metrics improve most and least, and what negative impacts emerge (e.g., skill-based routing might slightly increase average handling time for low-proficiency agents as they receive fewer matched tickets). This quantitative comparison provides the business case for investment decisions and identifies configuration parameters that maximize benefit.

### 5.2 Implementation Roadmap

**Phase One: Foundation (Weeks 1-8)** establishes the data infrastructure and baseline measurement needed for all strategies. This phase focuses on data quality improvement: reconciling agent skill profiles against actual capabilities, implementing the proficiency scoring based on historical outcomes, establishing real-time workload tracking, and deploying the initial process mining dashboards that will track ongoing performance. This phase requires significant IT involvement to integrate data sources and build the analytical foundation, but produces immediate value through improved visibility into current operations.

**Phase Two: Initial Deployment (Weeks 9-16)** implements the lowest-risk strategy—likely workload balancing, which addresses visible symptoms without changing skill matching logic. This phase validates the operational integration, trains dispatchers and agents on new behaviors, and establishes the monitoring frameworks that will track improvement. Early results provide validation that the approach works in production, not just simulation, and identify any implementation issues requiring correction.

**Phase Three: Advanced Capabilities (Weeks 17-32)** implements the remaining strategies in sequence, with each building on the foundation and learning from prior deployments. Skill-based routing follows workload balancing as it requires the proficiency scoring infrastructure established in Phase One. Predictive assignment follows as it leverages both the skill framework and the process understanding developed through earlier phases. Dynamic tier allocation last, as it requires confidence in the other systems and represents the most significant operational change.

**Phase Four: Optimization (Ongoing)** continuously refines all strategies based on observed outcomes. Models drift as ticket patterns change; thresholds require tuning as the system evolves; new opportunities emerge from accumulated data. This phase institutionalizes the improvement capability, transforming TechSolve from a reactive organization that responds to problems to a proactive one that anticipates and prevents them.

### 5.3 Monitoring Framework and Continuous Improvement

Post-implementation monitoring requires dashboards and KPIs that track both the operational health of the assignment system and the strategic outcomes it produces. The monitoring framework should provide visibility at multiple organizational levels: agents see their personal performance and queue state; team leads see aggregate team metrics and individual comparisons; management sees strategic KPIs and trend analysis.

**Operational Dashboards** provide real-time visibility into current system state. Queue depth visualization shows ticket counts and waiting times across tiers and skill categories, enabling immediate identification of emerging bottlenecks. Agent workload displays show current assignments and capacity, enabling supervisors to redistribute work before delays occur. Assignment decision logs record recent automated decisions for audit and troubleshooting.

**Strategic KPI Tracking** monitors the outcomes that matter to TechSolve's leadership. SLA compliance rates by priority, category, and tier track service quality trends. Resolution time distributions show whether the tail of long-resolution cases is shrinking. Reassignment frequency metrics track whether skill matching is improving. Workload distribution metrics (Gini coefficient or similar) track equity across the agent pool. Skill utilization metrics track whether specialists are spending time on specialist work.

**Process Mining Views** enable drill-down investigation when KPIs indicate problems. Variant analysis compares current process flows against the optimized target model, identifying where actual behavior diverges from intended behavior. Bottleneck analysis pinpoints which resources and activities create delays. Social network analysis tracks whether assignment patterns are producing healthy collaboration or problematic dependency structures.

**Alerting and Anomaly Detection** proactive notifies operators when metrics exceed thresholds or when patterns deviate from expected behavior. If SLA breach rates for P2 tickets increase by more than 10% week-over-week, the system should alert management and provide diagnostic information. If a specific agent's reassignment rate suddenly increases, the system should flag this for supervisor review. This proactive capability transforms monitoring from passive observation to active problem detection.

## Conclusion

TechSolve Solutions' resource assignment challenges—SLA breaches, excessive reassignments, skill mismatches, and workload inequality—are addressable through systematic application of process mining analysis and data-driven optimization. The event log captured over the past year contains the evidence needed to diagnose current problems, understand their root causes, and design interventions that will improve performance.

The four proposed strategies—skill-based routing with proficiency weighting, workload-balanced queue management, predictive assignment based on ticket content analysis, and dynamic tier resource allocation—address different aspects of the assignment problem and can be implemented individually or in combination depending on TechSolve's priorities and capabilities. All strategies share a common foundation: they replace the current intuition-based and rules-based assignment logic with empirical, data-driven decision-making that continuously learns from outcomes.

The path forward requires investment in data infrastructure, analytical capability, and organizational change management. The potential returns—reduced resolution times, improved SLA compliance, better agent utilization, and higher customer satisfaction—justify this investment and position TechSolve for sustainable competitive advantage in IT service delivery. Process mining provides the visibility and insight needed to transform resource assignment from a chronic source of problems into a strategic capability that drives operational excellence.
