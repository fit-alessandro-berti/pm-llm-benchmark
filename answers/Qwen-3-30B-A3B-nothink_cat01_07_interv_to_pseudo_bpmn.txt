  - **Yes**: Proceed to log invoice and forward to Purchasing  
  - **No**: Request revised invoice or additional info  

- **Decision: Invoice Matches PO?**  
  - **Yes**: Proceed to manager approval  
  - **No**: Escalate to supervisor for exception handling  

- **Decision: Manager Approves?**  
  - **Yes**: Schedule for payment  
  - **No**: Escalate to supervisor for exception handling

#### **6. Exceptions / Variations**

- **No Valid PO Number**:  
  - Invoice is sent back to supplier for clarification or revised invoice  
  - May require retrospective PO creation  

- **Invoice Discrepancies**:  
  - Discrepancies may be resolved by supplier or through internal coordination  
  - If unresolved, escalated to supervisor for intervention  

- **Manager Rejection or Request for Further Investigation**:  
  - Invoice is held for further review  
  - May require additional documentation or supplier contact  

- **No PO for Services**:  
  - May require coordination with department heads to create a retrospective PO  
  - In some cases, invoice may be rejected if no PO can be created  

- **Supplier Non-Compliance**:  
  - Supplier Relationship Manager may be involved to resolve discrepancies or clarify terms  

---

### **Notes on Ambiguity and Uncertainty**

- The exact sequence of steps after a **revised invoice** or **retrospective PO** is not fully detailed, so it is assumed to follow the same flow as a standard invoice.  
- The **payment scheduling process** is described as automatic, but the exact system or mechanism is not specified.  
- The **role of the Supplier Relationship Manager** is more of a support role and not directly involved in system approvals, but may be called in for resolution.  
- **Manager rejections** are not fully described in terms of how they are resolved, so the process assumes escalation to the supervisor.

### **Summary of Process Flow (in Narrative Form)**

The invoice approval process begins when an invoice is received by the Accounts Payable Clerk. The clerk first checks for a valid purchase order (PO). If no valid PO is present, the invoice is sent back to the supplier for clarification. If a valid PO is present, the invoice is logged into the system and forwarded to the Purchasing Department for confirmation of receipt. Once receipt is confirmed, the invoice is matched with the PO. If there are discrepancies, the issue is escalated to the supervisor for resolution, potentially involving the Supplier Relationship Manager to contact the supplier. If no discrepancies are found, the invoice is sent to the Department Manager for final approval. The manager may approve the invoice, schedule it for payment, or request further investigation. If the manager rejects or questions the invoice, it is escalated to the supervisor for further action. The process concludes with the invoice being scheduled for payment or held for further review.
