1. How does the company balance the trade-off between relying on specialized, geographically dispersed component suppliers and the risks posed by geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or trade restrictions in those regions?

2. In what ways could the company redesign its smartphone architecture (e.g., modular components, multi-sourcing key parts) to reduce dependency on single-source suppliers without compromising performance or cost?

3. How are lead-time variabilities from different suppliers (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, US) modeled and incorporated into production planning, and where are the biggest forecasting blind spots?

4. What strategies could be implemented to improve end-to-end visibility of inventory and work-in-progress across all suppliers, the Malaysian assembly plant, logistics partners, and regional distribution centers?

5. How does the company measure and manage total landed cost for each market, and how could better data or modeling change decisions about transportation modes (air vs. sea) and consolidation strategies?

6. In what ways might the company redesign its logistics network (e.g., hub-and-spoke, regional assembly, postponement strategies) to reduce lead times while also lowering carbon emissions?

7. How does the company reconcile conflicting objectives between just-in-time inventory for high-demand markets and cost-optimized batch shipments for slower markets, and what decision rules govern these trade-offs?

8. What are the most critical quality checkpoints across the supply chain, and how could earlier detection of defects (e.g., at supplier or sub-assembly stages) significantly reduce rework, scrap, or recalls?

9. How are data analytics and machine learning models validated for bias, accuracy, and robustness across different regions and product launches, and what governance is in place to update or override these models?

10. In what ways could closer collaboration or data sharing with suppliers and logistics partners (e.g., forecast sharing, capacity planning, real-time telemetry) improve reliability and reduce bullwhip effects?

11. How does the company manage regulatory complexity (safety, environmental, labor, data privacy) across multiple jurisdictions, and where are the biggest compliance risks or potential bottlenecks?

12. What resilience strategies (e.g., buffer stocks, dual sourcing, flexible contracts, alternative transport routes) are in place for critical components, and how often are these stress-tested through scenario planning?

13. How might upcoming environmental regulations or carbon pricing schemes change sourcing decisions, transportation choices, or product design priorities over the next 5–10 years?

14. In what ways could circular economy practices—such as refurbishing, component reuse, or take-back programs—be integrated into the supply chain without eroding profitability or complicating operations excessively?

15. How does the company ensure ethical labor practices not only in its own assembly plant but also deep into its upstream suppliers and logistics partners, and how is this monitored and audited?

16. What mechanisms exist to quickly detect and respond to post-launch issues (e.g., defects, safety concerns, performance problems) and to coordinate global product recalls or firmware fixes efficiently?

17. How are demand-planning decisions influenced by marketing campaigns, competitor actions, and macroeconomic indicators, and where do misalignments between sales forecasts and supply capabilities most often occur?

18. How could advanced simulation or digital twin technologies be used to experiment with network changes (e.g., shifting suppliers, altering inventory policies) before making costly real-world adjustments?

19. What is the governance structure for cross-functional decision-making among R&D, procurement, manufacturing, logistics, finance, and compliance, and where do misaligned incentives lead to suboptimal outcomes?

20. How does the company assess the long-term strategic impact of its supply chain decisions on brand reputation, customer trust, and sustainability positioning, beyond short-term cost and lead-time metrics?
