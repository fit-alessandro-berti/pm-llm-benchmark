### **Analysis and Renaming of Activities**

After analyzing the event log, I identified two activities that recur within the same case with different contextual meanings:  

1. **"Verify Documents"** – Occurs multiple times but with different purposes:  
   - First occurrence: Initial document verification (may lead to a request for missing documents).  
   - Second occurrence: Re-verification after additional documents are submitted or after account adjustments.  

2. **"Call Customer"** – Occurs multiple times with different intents:  
   - First occurrence: Outbound call to request missing documents or clarify discrepancies.  
   - Second occurrence: Follow-up call to confirm adjustments or completion.

```  

### **Justification for Renaming**  

1. **"Verify Documents" → "Verify Documents (Initial)" & "Verify Documents (Recheck/Post-Adjust)"**  
   - The first verification is a preliminary check (may lead to further actions).  
   - The second verification occurs after additional input (e.g., missing documents or account adjustments).  

2. **"Call Customer" → "Call Customer (Request Docs/Clarify Issue/Recall)" & "Call Customer (Follow-Up)"**  
   - The first call is **proactive** (requesting missing info, clarifying discrepancies, or recalling the customer).  
   - The second call is a **follow-up** (confirming resolution or adjustments).  

### **Key Benefits of Renaming**  
- **Disambiguates process steps** – Makes it clear whether an activity is an initial check, a recheck, or a follow-up.  
- **Improves process mining** – Helps in analyzing bottlenecks (e.g., repeated verifications or excessive follow-ups).  
- **Better resource allocation** – Distinguishes between different types of calls (initial vs. follow-up).  

This renaming ensures that each activity’s role in the workflow is immediately clear from its label.
