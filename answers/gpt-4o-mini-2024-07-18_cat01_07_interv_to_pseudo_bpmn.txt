#### Exception Handling:
- **Escalation for Discrepancies**
  - If the invoice cannot be matched or has issues that can't be quickly resolved, the Accounts Payable Clerk escalates to the Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).

- **Missing PO Cases**
  - Invoices lacking a PO are redirected to the Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) for assistance in obtaining necessary documentation or resolving discrepancies.

#### Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:
- **Inputs**: Incoming invoices, Purchase Orders (PO), email confirmations.
- **Outputs**: Approved invoices, scheduled payments.

### Notes on Ambiguities:
- The process of escalating discrepancies appears to vary; sometimes it involves the Accounts Payable Supervisor and at other times may not—this is noted as an area of uncertainty. 
- The direct interplay of roles at some points in the approval process may not always be clear. For example, it is implied that the Supervisor resolves ambiguities but without specific detail on how frequently this occurs.

This structured representation can guide the creation of a visual BPMN diagram, providing clarity on the steps, roles, and decision points involved in the invoice approval process.
