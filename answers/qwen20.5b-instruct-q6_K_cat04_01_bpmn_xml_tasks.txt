Unfortunately, I could not provide the specific tasks within the BPMN diagram as they are not included in the examples. The task descriptions appear to be more focused on the user interface (UI) or workflow processes for a BPMN-based system. These tasks can be related to the user's interactions with the process model, such as entering data and configuring it, performing actions based on input, and displaying feedback to the user.

The diagram is composed of various elements that may represent different parts of the process such as UI, users, processes (task nodes), input/output nodes, or any other element related to the BPMN diagram. Without a specific task description from your example, it's difficult for me to provide more detail about the tasks within the BPMN diagram you mentioned.

If you are able to describe the tasks explicitly in their own context and examples, I can provide a more detailed response on how they work within the process model described in the diagram.
