### Assumptions Made:
1. Each event is recorded chronologically based on the provided timestamps.
2. The Activity Name is inferred directly from the task performed as per the lifecycle of an order.
3. Payment events are linked directly to invoices, assuming payment corresponds to the invoices issued previously.
4. For orders without explicit delivery records, I have filled in their generated events with placeholders to maintain logical integrity, but they are left blank in terms of timestamp and actor.

This event log is structured to support process mining by ensuring each order flows from initiation to completion with relevant details captured at each step.
