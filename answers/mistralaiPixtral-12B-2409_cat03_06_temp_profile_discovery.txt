To generate a temporal profile for the given process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities that appear consecutively in any of the process variants. Here's how you can approach this:

1. **Identify all pairs of consecutive activities**: For each process variant, identify all pairs of activities that are directly followed by another activity.

2. **Calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair**: For each pair of activities, calculate the average time between them and their standard deviation across all occurrences in the process variants.

Let's assume you have a dataset where you can extract the timestamps for each activity. For simplicity, I'll provide a conceptual approach without actual data.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Extract Pairs of Activities**:
   - For each process variant, extract pairs of consecutive activities.

2. **Calculate Times Between Activities**:
   - For each pair of activities, calculate the time difference between their occurrences.

3. **Aggregate Statistics**:
   - Calculate the average and standard deviation of these time differences for each pair of activities.

### Example Code (Conceptual)

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from statistics import mean, stdev

# Example process variants (timestamps are placeholders)
process_variants = [
    [("Create Fine", 0), ("Send Fine", 1), ("Insert Fine Notification", 2), ("Add penalty", 3), ("Send for Credit Collection", 4)],
    [("Create Fine", 0), ("Payment", 1)],
    # Add more variants here...
]

# Dictionary to store temporal profile
temporal_profile = defaultdict(list)

# Process each variant to extract pairs of activities and their times
for variant in process_variants:
    for i in range(len(variant) - 1):
        activity1, time1 = variant[i]
        activity2, time2 = variant[i + 1]
        time_difference = time2 - time1
        temporal_profile[(activity1, activity2)].append(time_difference)

# Calculate average and standard deviation for each pair
temporal_profile_dict = {}
for (activity1, activity2), times in temporal_profile.items():
    avg_time = mean(times)
    std_time = stdev(times) if len(times) > 1 else 0
    temporal_profile_dict[(activity1, activity2)] = (avg_time, std_time)

# Print the temporal profile
for pair, stats in temporal_profile_dict.items():
    print(f"{pair}: {stats}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Extract Pairs of Activities**: For each process variant, we extract pairs of consecutive activities.
2. **Calculate Times Between Activities**: We calculate the time difference between each pair of consecutive activities.
3. **Aggregate Statistics**: We aggregate the time differences for each pair of activities and calculate the average and standard deviation.

### Output

The output will be a dictionary where each key is a pair of activities, and the value is a tuple containing the average time and the standard deviation of the times between those activities.

### Note

- This example assumes you have timestamps for each activity. You need to replace the placeholder timestamps with actual timestamps from your dataset.
- The `statistics` module in Python is used to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

By following this approach, you can generate a temporal profile for your process variants.
