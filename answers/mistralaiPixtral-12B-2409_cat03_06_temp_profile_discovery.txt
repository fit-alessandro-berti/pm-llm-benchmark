To generate a temporal profile for the given process variants, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities that appear consecutively in any of the process variants. This involves several steps:

1. Identify all unique pairs of activities that appear consecutively in any process variant.
2. Calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between these pairs of activities across all process executions.

Given the complexity and the large number of process variants, the following Python code snippet demonstrates how to generate the temporal profile. Note that this code assumes you have a dataset containing the timestamps for each activity in each process execution.

```python
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict
import numpy as np

# Example dataset: timestamps for each activity in each process execution
# Each row represents a process execution, and each column represents an activity with its timestamp
data = {
    'Create Fine': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    'Send Fine': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    'Insert Fine Notification': [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    'Add penalty': [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    'Send for Credit Collection': [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    'Payment': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11],
    'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
    'Send Appeal to Prefecture': [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13],
    'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
    'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
    'Appeal to Judge': [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
}

# Convert the data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Initialize a dictionary to store the average and standard deviation of times between pairs of activities
temporal_profile = defaultdict(lambda: {'avg': 0, 'std': 0})

# Iterate over the DataFrame to calculate the time differences between consecutive activities
for index in range(1, len(df)):
    for activity in df.columns:
        previous_activity = df.loc[index - 1, activity]
        current_activity = df.loc[index, activity]
        if pd.notna(previous_activity) and pd.notna(current_activity):
            time_diff = current_activity - previous_activity
            temporal_profile[(previous_activity, current_activity)]['avg'] += time_diff
            temporal_profile[(previous_activity, current_activity)]['std'] += time_diff ** 2

# Calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair of activities
for key in temporal_profile:
    temporal_profile[key]['avg'] /= len(df)
    temporal_profile[key]['std'] = np.sqrt(temporal_profile[key]['std'] / len(df) - (temporal_profile[key]['avg'] ** 2))

# Convert the dictionary to a more readable format
temporal_profile = {key: (value['avg'], value['std']) for key, value in temporal_profile.items()}

# Print the temporal profile
for pair, stats in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"Pair: {pair}, Avg: {stats[0]}, Std: {stats[1]}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Preparation**: The example dataset `data` contains timestamps for each activity in each process execution. This dataset should be replaced with the actual timestamps from your process executions.
2. **DataFrame Creation**: Convert the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
3. **Temporal Profile Initialization**: Initialize a dictionary to store the average and standard deviation of times between pairs of activities.
4. **Time Difference Calculation**: Iterate over the DataFrame to calculate the time differences between consecutive activities.
5. **Average and Standard Deviation Calculation**: Calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair of activities.
6. **Output**: Print the temporal profile.

This code provides a basic framework for generating a temporal profile. You should replace the example dataset with your actual data and ensure that the timestamps are in a comparable format (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours).
