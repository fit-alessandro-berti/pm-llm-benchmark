Based on the provided directly follows graph, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process. Please note that this is an interpretation, and some details might be ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

The process appears to be related to logistics, transportation, and container management. Here's a high-level overview:

**Main Process Flows:**

1. **Customer Order Handling**:
	* Customer orders are registered, and a transport document is created.
	* The transport document is used to book vehicles.
	* Vehicles are then ordered to depart.
2. **Container Management**:
	* Containers are ordered empty.
	* They are picked up, loaded onto trucks, and transported to a terminal.
	* At the terminal, containers are weighed, and their contents are brought to a loading bay.
	* Containers are then loaded onto vehicles (e.g., trucks, forklifts) for transportation.
3. **Vehicle and Truck Management**:
	* Vehicles are booked for transportation.
	* Trucks are loaded with containers, and their contents are transported to a terminal.
	* Trucks may be rescheduled or have their contents reweighed.
4. **Terminal Operations**:
	* Containers are weighed, and their contents are brought to a loading bay.
	* Containers are loaded onto vehicles or trucks for transportation.
	* Containers may be rescheduled or have their contents reweighed.

**Recurring Patterns and Loops:**

1. **Container Rescheduling**: Containers may be rescheduled due to various reasons, leading to a loop of rescheduling, reweighing, and reloading.
2. **Vehicle and Truck Loading**: Vehicles and trucks are repeatedly loaded with containers, which are then transported to a terminal.
3. **Terminal Operations Loop**: Containers are weighed, brought to a loading bay, and loaded onto vehicles or trucks, creating a loop of terminal operations.

**Notable Events and Transitions:**

1. **"Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck"**: This transition indicates that goods are collected and loaded onto trucks, which is a starting point for the container management process.
2. **"Weigh" -> "Place in Stock"**: Containers are weighed, and their contents are placed in stock, suggesting a transition from transportation to storage.
3. **"Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle"**: Containers are brought to a loading bay and loaded onto vehicles, indicating a transition from storage to transportation.

Overall, the process involves managing customer orders, containers, vehicles, and trucks to facilitate transportation and logistics operations. The directly follows graph highlights the complex interactions and loops within the process.
