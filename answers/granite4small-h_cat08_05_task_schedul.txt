### Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

**Reconstructing Job Flow with Process Mining:**
To analyze historical scheduling performance using process mining techniques on MES event logs from Precision Parts Inc., we begin by reconstructing the job flow through various operations. This involves parsing timestamps, activity identifiers, resource assignments (machines/operators), task durations, setup requirements, and sequence information. 

**Techniques and Metrics for Analysis:**
- **Job Flow Times & Makespan Distributions:** To quantify job flow times (the total time a job spends in the system) and makespan distributions, we employ techniques like Directly Follows Graphs to visualize paths jobs take through tasks/machines, and calculate metrics such as throughput time per operation. Tools like process mining software packages (e.g., Celonis or Disco) can be used here.
- **Task Waiting Times:** Queue times at each work center are derived by computing the difference between when a job arrives at a machine's queue and its actual start time for processing on that machine, captured through logs of task events. This quantifies bottlenecks and inefficiencies in resource utilization.
- **Resource Utilization:** Machine (and operator) utilizations can be calculated using metrics such as productive time/total available time ratios derived from timestamped activity logs. Setup times specifically are identified via 'Setup Start' and 'Setup End' entries, allowing us to dissect the proportion of idle versus productive machine use.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setups:** Analyzing sequence-dependent setup times involves identifying patterns in setups that follow specific preceding jobs on the same machine. By mapping sequences (e.g., from JOB-A to JOB-B) using logs and correlating with setup duration, we can quantify how job order affects setup time.
- **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:** To measure schedule adherence, deviation analysis is performed by comparing planned start/completion dates against actual ones recorded in the log. This highlights tardiness frequency and magnitude (e.g., percentage of jobs completed past due date).
- **Impact of Disruptions:** By tagging events like breakdowns or priority changes within logs, we can trace their impacts on subsequent job flows and resource schedules—using techniques such as variant analysis to compare scenarios with/without disruptions.

### Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

**Identifying Key Inefficiencies:**
The performance analysis is likely to reveal several pathologies:

- **Bottleneck Identification:** Variance in task waiting times highlights machines with excessive queue lengths, indicating bottlenecks. Quantification can be achieved by comparing machine utilization rates—particularly those significantly above others.
  
- **Task Prioritization Failures:** Evidence may show high-priority jobs or near-due date jobs lagging behind due to inadequate prioritization metrics in scheduling rules (e.g., First-Come-First-Served overstepping priority-based dispatching).
  
- **Suboptimal Sequencing:** Analysis of setup durations across different sequences can reveal sequencing inefficiencies, where certain job orders drastically increase total setup times compared to alternatives.
  
- **Starvation and WIP Bullwhip Effect:** Downstream resource starvation is diagnosed through prolonged waiting periods for tasks at these resources. Simultaneously, high variability in task flow times contributes to fluctuations in work-in-progress (WIP), exacerbating the bullwhip effect.

**Process Mining Utilization:**
Bottleneck analysis isolates machines with highest utilization or queue lengths; variant analysis contrasts schedules leading to timely completion versus delays; resource contention periods are scrutinized for patterns indicating suboptimal scheduling logic. This triangulation of techniques provides robust evidence for identified inefficiencies.

### Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

**Underlying Causes:**
- **Static Dispatching Rules:** The ineffectiveness of simple rules like First-Come-First-Served in dynamic environments underscores their limitations, particularly when jobs vary widely in processing times and priorities.
  
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Incomplete or outdated data regarding machine availability or current queue lengths hampers real-time scheduling adjustments. Historical logs reveal gaps where decisions were made without current state awareness.

- **Inaccurate Estimations:** Historical task duration distributions from logs may show discrepancies with planned durations, indicating reliance on inaccurate estimations for planning and scheduling.
  
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Inefficiencies:** Without optimization in sequencing similar jobs consecutively, setups are lengthier due to frequent changes in job characteristics (e.g., material type or size).
  
- **Coordination Issues & Disruption Handling:** Logs expose poor coordination between work centers, evidenced by downstream resources waiting on upstream delays. Additionally, inadequate response strategies for unplanned breakdowns or urgent jobs disrupt smooth operations.

**Differentiating Causes:**
Process mining distinguishes scheduling logic flaws from capacity issues by comparing actual vs. planned schedules under similar conditions. For instance, if tasks consistently overrun estimates regardless of schedule type, it suggests estimation inaccuracies over poor planning. Conversely, instances where certain plans mitigate delays despite identical task logs suggest strategic shortcomings.

### Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

**Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules**
Improve dispatching by incorporating multiple dynamic factors:
- **Factors Considered:** Remaining processing time, due date urgency (criticality), operator expertise/machine capability match, and estimated sequence-dependent setup times.
- **Data Informed Choices:** Historical logs offer insights into average durations, typical setups, and job criticality impacts on tardiness. Critical jobs might be prioritized despite longer queue times if they prevent downstream bottlenecks.

**Impact:**
Reduced tardiness through prioritization based on current system state; improved resource utilization by matching jobs to operator/machine strengths.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling**
Utilize historical task duration distributions and predictive maintenance insights:
- **Task Durations:** Model variations in processing times using statistical or machine learning models trained on log data, considering factors like job complexity or material type.
- **Breakdown Predictions:** Integrate predictive maintenance models (if sensor data available) to anticipate breakdowns, adjusting schedules preemptively.

**Impact:**
More realistic schedules mitigate unexpected delays; proactive adjustments prevent potential bottlenecks from known failure risks.

**Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization**
Minimize sequence-dependent setups through intelligent batching:
- **Batching Strategy:** Analyze historical logs to identify job sequences with minimal setup transitions (e.g., grouping similar materials or sizes). Use this insight for scheduling at bottleneck machines.
- **Dynamic Sequencing Algorithms:** Implement algorithms that dynamically adjust sequencing in real-time based on current queue compositions and upcoming jobs.

**Impact:**
Reduces total setup times, particularly at critical machines; enhances throughput by minimizing non-productive changeovers.

### Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Simulation for Strategy Testing:**
Discrete-event simulation models parameterized with mined data (e.g., task duration distributions, breakdown frequencies) evaluate strategy effectiveness under various scenarios:
- **Scenarios Tested:** High load periods, frequent disruptions, priority job surges.
- **Comparison Metrics:** Tardiness rates, WIP levels, makespan efficiency.

**Expected Outcomes:**
Simulations provide a risk-free environment to assess impacts of scheduling strategies on KPIs before implementation. Insights from simulations guide refinements in logic or parameters for optimal performance tuning.

**Continuous Monitoring Framework:**
Post-implementation, ongoing process mining ensures strategy effectiveness:
- **KPI Tracking:** Regularly updated dashboards track tardiness, WIP levels, and resource utilization against targets.
- **Drift Detection & Adaptation:** Automated alerts trigger schedule adjustments when deviations from expected KPI trends exceed predefined thresholds. Continuous updates to models (e.g., task duration predictions) incorporate new log data for accuracy.

This framework ensures scheduling strategies remain aligned with shop floor realities, adapting dynamically to evolving conditions while maintaining operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
