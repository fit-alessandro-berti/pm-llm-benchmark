### **1. Identification of Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**  
**Total Resolution Time (Close Timestamp – Receive Timestamp):**  
- **Case 101:** 2 hours 15 minutes  
- **Case 102:** 25 hours 10 minutes **(Outlier)**  
- **Case 103:** 1 hour 20 minutes  
- **Case 104:** 24 hours 10 minutes **(Outlier)**  
- **Case 105:** 49 hours 5 minutes **(Extreme Outlier)**  

**Key Observations:**  
- **Cases 102, 104, and 105** have resolution times **10–20x longer** than the average (~110 minutes).  
- **Case 105** is the worst-performing case, taking **49+ hours**, primarily due to **escalations, delays, and rework**.

### **2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**  
#### **Factor 1: Escalations to Level-2 Teams**  
- **Case 102:** Escalated to Level-2 at 11:30 AM (same day). Investigation started 2.5 hours later but took **19 hours** (14:00 to 09:00 next day).  
- **Case 105:** Escalated to Level-2 at 02:00 PM on Day 2. Investigation restarted at 09:00 AM on Day 3, adding **~38 hours** to the cycle.  
- **Impact:** Escalations introduce **inefficiencies in handoffs** and delays while Level-2 teams prioritize the ticket.  

#### **Factor 2: Long Investigation Times**  
- **Case 102, 104, 105:** Investigations consistently took **~19 hours** (e.g., 13:00–08:00 next day for Case 104).  
- **Impact:** Agents may lack resources, face knowledge gaps, or encounter unstructured issues requiring prolonged diagnostics.  

#### **Factor 3: Delays Between Activities**  
- **Case 105:** **28-hour gap** between "Resolve Ticket" (10:00 AM) and "Escalate" (02:00 PM next day).  
- **Case 104:** **3.5-hour delay** between assignment and investigation (09:30 AM–01:00 PM).  
- **Impact:** Idle time between steps increases cycle time without adding value.  

#### **Factor 4: Rework (Case 105)**  
- After the initial "Resolve Ticket" (10:00 AM), the ticket was re-investigated post-escalation, adding **~38 hours**.  
- **Impact:** Poor first-resolve quality or unclear handoffs between teams lead to rework.

### **3. Cycle Time Analysis and Recommendations**  
#### **Cycle Time Breakdown (Extreme Case: 105):**  
| Activity                | Time Difference      | Cumulative Time |  
|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------|  
| Receive  Triage        | 10 minutes          | 0:10           |  
| Triage  Assign        | 25 minutes          | 0:35           |  
| Assign  Investigate*    | 50 minutes          | 1:25           |  
| Resolve  Escalate         | 28 hours            | **29:25**      |  
| Escalate  Investigate  | 19 hours            | **48:25**      |  
| Investigate  Resolve** | 1 hour              | **49:25**      |

#### **Recommendations to Reduce Cycle Times**  
1. **Optimize Escalation Workflow:**  
   - Implement **real-time priority tagging** for escalated tickets to minimize handoff delays.  
   - Train Level-2 teams on **fast-track processes** (e.g., pre-assigned experts) for urgent issues.  

2. **Shorten Investigation Times:**  
   - Deploy **automated diagnostics** (e.g., chatbots, AI triage) to resolve 80% of issues at Level-1.  
   - Create a **knowledge base** with documented solutions for common issues.  

3. **Reduce Idle Times:**  
   - Introduce **SLAs for transitions** (e.g., 30-minute rule for assignment post-triage).  
   - Use **workflow monitoring tools** to flag delays >1 hour (e.g., Assign  Investigate gaps).  

4. **Prevent Rework:**  
   - Introduce **peer reviews** for complex resolutions before escalation.  
   - Use **SLAs for verification** (e.g., 1-hour check post-resolution to confirm adequacy).  

5. **Process Mining and Monitoring:**  
   - Apply **PDM analysis** to identify bottlenecks (e.g., 28-hour gap in Case 105).  
   - Set **KPI thresholds**:  
     - Triage: 30 minutes  
     - Investigation: 4 hours (95th percentile)  
     - Escalation resolution: 12 hours  

6. **Agent Training:**  
   - Upskill Level-1 agents on escalating effectively (e.g., detailed documentation for Level-2).  
   - Use **time-motion studies** to benchmark investigation durations and identify outliers.

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
- **Cycle Time Reduction:**  
  - Eliminating idle times (e.g., 28-hour gap in Case 105) could save **10–20 hours** per case.  
  - Shorter investigations via automation could reduce time by **50–70%**.  
- **Capacity Efficiency:**  
  - Reducing rework (e.g., Case 105) frees up **~2–3 hours/case** for other tasks.  
- **Customer Satisfaction:**  
  - Faster resolutions (e.g., <4 hours for simple issues) improve NPS and reduce churn.  

**Tools to Deploy:**  
- **Process Mining Software** (e.g., Celonis) to monitor activity gaps.  
- **AI-Powered Triage** (e.g., ServiceNow’s NLP tools) to automate 70% of triage.  
- **SLA Dashboards** for real-time visibility into bottlenecks.  

By addressing these factors, the organization can reduce average resolution times by **40–60%** and eliminate extreme outliers like Case 105.
