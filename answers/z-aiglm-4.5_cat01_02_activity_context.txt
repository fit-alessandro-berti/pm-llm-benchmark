### Justification for Renaming Activities

#### 1. **Verify Documents** (Renamed to Two Variants)
   - **Initial Document Verification**  
     - **Context**: First occurrence in all cases (C001, C002, C003).  
     - **Clues**:  
       - Always appears early in the process (after `Initiate Request`).  
       - Context describes "identity verification" or "physical verification of ID."  
       - Represents the foundational check of documents before any issues arise.  
     - **Why renamed?** Distinguishes it from subsequent verifications triggered by specific events (e.g., missing docs or adjustments).

   - **Re-verify after Customer Submission** (C001)  
     - **Context**: Second occurrence in C001.  
     - **Clues**:  
       - Follows `Submit Additional` (customer uploads missing ID scan).  
       - Context explicitly states "re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."  
     - **Why renamed?** Highlights that verification is a **re-check** triggered by **customer action** (submission of missing docs).

   - **Re-verify after Account Adjustment** (C003)  
     - **Context**: Second occurrence in C003.  
     - **Clues**:  
       - Follows `Adjust Account` (internal correction).  
       - Context specifies "re-verify docs after account adjustment."  
     - **Why renamed?** Emphasizes that verification is a **re-check** triggered by **internal action** (account adjustment), differing from C001's customer-triggered re-verification.

#### 2. **Call Customer** (Renamed to Three Variants)
   - **Call for Missing Documents** (C001)  
     - **Context**: Only call in C001.  
     - **Clues**:  
       - Follows incomplete `Initial Document Verification`.  
       - Context states "verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs."  
     - **Why renamed?** Clearly links the call to **document-related issues**.

   - **Call for Clarification** (C002, First Call)  
     - **Context**: First call in C002.  
     - **Clues**:  
       - Occurs after `Initial Document Verification` but before `Adjust Account`.  
       - Context describes "outbound call to clarify account discrepancy."  
     - **Why renamed?** Indicates the call is to **resolve ambiguity** (account discrepancy) before adjustments.

   - **Call for Confirmation** (C002, Second Call)  
     - **Context**: Second call in C002.  
     - **Clues**:  
       - Follows `Adjust Account`.  
       - Context notes "follow-up call to confirm adjustments made."  
     - **Why renamed?** Shows the call is to **validate completion** of adjustments, contrasting with the earlier clarifying call.

   - **Call to Return** (C003)  
     - **Context**: Only call in C003.  
     - **Clues**:  
       - Follows `Initial Document Verification` but precedes `Adjust Account`.  
       - Context states "customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return."  
     - **Why renamed?** Focuses on **logistical coordination** (customer presence) rather than document/account issues.

### Key Insights from Contextual Analysis
- **Positional Clues**:  
  - Recurring activities derive meaning from **sequence**:  
    - `Verify Documents` first = initial check; subsequent = re-check triggered by prior events.  
    - `Call Customer` early = proactive outreach (clarification/missing docs); later = confirmation/logistics.  

- **Trigger Clues**:  
  - **Customer actions** (e.g., submitting docs) vs. **internal actions** (e.g., account adjustments) dictate renaming.  
  - **Resource roles** (e.g., `FrontlineAgent` for outbound calls) reinforce purpose (e.g., customer interaction vs. internal tasks).  

- **Contextual Descriptions**:  
  - Explicit phrases (e.g., "re-checks after ID scan," "follow-up to confirm") directly informed new names.  

This renaming ensures each activity name reflects its **unique purpose** within the workflow, eliminating ambiguity while preserving process flow transparency.
