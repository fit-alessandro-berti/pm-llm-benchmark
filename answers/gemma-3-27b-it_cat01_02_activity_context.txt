## Justification of Naming Choices

The following activities were renamed to provide more context:

*   **Verify Documents:** This activity appeared multiple times, with different purposes.
    *   **Verify Documents - Initial:** Used for the first verification attempt.
    *   **Verify Documents - Resubmitted:** Used when documents were re-verified after the customer submitted additional information.
    *   **Verify Documents - Branch:** Used specifically when the verification occurred at a physical branch.
    *   **Verify Documents - Post-Adjust:** Used when documents were re-verified after an account adjustment.

*   **Call Customer:** This activity also had varying contexts.
    *   **Call Customer - ID Verification:** Specifically for calls related to requesting missing ID documents.
    *   **Call Customer - Discrepancy:** For calls to clarify account discrepancies.
    *   **Call Customer - Confirmation:** For follow-up calls to confirm adjustments.
    *   **Call Customer - Recall:** For calls to have the customer return to the branch.

The renaming strategy focused on adding a qualifier to the original activity name to indicate *why* the activity was being performed. This makes the process flow much clearer and easier to understand, especially when analyzing the log for process mining or improvement purposes.  The "Additional Context" column provided crucial clues for determining the appropriate qualifiers.  The location (branch vs. web portal) and the reason for the call were key differentiators.
