Certainly! Based on the interview transcripts, here is a structured textual BPMN-like process model capturing the invoice approval workflow, roles, decision points, and exceptions:

---

**Process: Invoice Approval Workflow**

**Participants/Roles:**  
- **Supplier**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**  
- **Purchasing Department (Dan)**  
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**

**Data Artifacts:**  
- Invoice Document  
- Purchase Order (PO) Document  
- Confirmation / Approval Emails  
- Discrepancy Reports / Issue Notes  

---

### Main Process Flow:

1. **Receive Invoice** *(Activity: Invoice Reception by Mary)*  
   - Trigger: Incoming invoice received by email.

2. **Check for PO Number** *(Gateway: Valid PO present?)*  
   - **Yes**: Proceed to Log and Process  
   - **No**:  
     - *Activity:* Send request to supplier for PO details  
     - *End this flow until PO is received*

3. **Log Invoice into System** *(Activity: Log Invoice in Accounting System)*

4. **Forward Invoice to Purchasing** *(Activity: Send invoice to Dan for verification)*

5. **Verify Invoice Against PO** *(Activity: Dan compares invoice details with PO)*

6. **Decision: Pricing/Quantity Match?** *(Gateway)*  
   - **Yes**: Proceed to Confirmation of Receipt  
   - **No**:  
     - *Attempt to resolve discrepancy:*  
       - Contact supplier for correction or clarification  
       - If unresolved, escalate to Supervisor (Rita) *(Sub-Process: Exception Handling)*

7. **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services** *(Activity: Purchasing confirms receipt)*

8. **Send Confirmation to Accounts Payable** *(Activity: Dan/Invoices team sends confirmation email)*

9. **Verify All Checks and Confirmations** *(Activity: Mary / System consolidates info)*

10. **Send for Manager Approval** *(Activity: Manager (Carlos) reviews invoice details)*

11. **Manager Decision** *(Gateway)*  
    - **Approve**: Proceed to scheduling payment  
    - **Reject / Query**:  
      - *Activity:* Manager rejects or requests further investigation  
      - *Loop back or escalate as needed*

12. **Post-Approval: Schedule Payment** *(Activity: Accounts Payable schedules payment)*

---

### Exceptions & Variations:

- **Missing or Invalid PO:**  
  - Mary sends invoice back to supplier requesting PO details.  
  - Until a valid PO is received, invoice remains on hold.

- **Discrepancy in invoice:**  
  - Dan or Mary contacts supplier or relevant department.  
  - If unsolvable quickly, escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
  - Rita works to resolve or create a retrospective PO, or reject invoice.

- **Unusual or High-Value Invoice:**  
  - Manager may reject or escalate for special approval.

- **Invoices without PO (e.g., Services, Informal Agreements):**  
  - Accounts Payable Supervisor and Supplier Relationship Manager coordinate to resolve or create retrospective PO.

- **Rework Loops:**  
  - Discrepancies lead to a cycle of communication until issues are resolved or invoice is rejected.

### Summary of Flow:

```
[Receive Invoice] --> [Check for PO Number]
  | Yes --> [Log Invoice] --> [Forward to Purchasing]
        --> [Verify PO Details]
             --> [Match?] --No--> [Resolve Discrepancy or Escalate]
             --> [Yes] --> [Confirm Receipt]
                      --> [Send Confirmation]
                      --> [Review & Approve by Manager]
                          --> [Approved] --> [Schedule Payment]
                          --> [Rejected/Query] --> [Loop or Escalate]
  | No --> [Request PO from Supplier] (Loop until received)
```

---

**Notes on Ambiguities:**  
- The exact sequence of some rework or exception handling is flexible; the process may loop multiple times before final approval or rejection.  
- Certain cases (designated in the transcripts) like invoices without PO for services involve additional steps that might be optional or handled differently.  
- The process involves multiple roles verifying, approving, or escalating issues, with communication via email, system notifications, or direct contact.

This textual process model should facilitate visualization in BPMN tools or further refinement into a formal diagram.
