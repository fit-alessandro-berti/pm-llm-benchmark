Based on the provided data, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Declaration and Payment Process

**Actors:**
- Employee
- Administration
- Budget Owner
- Pre-Approver (role not specified)
- Supervisor
- Missing (unknown role or status)

**States (Declaration):**
1. SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
2. APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION
3. APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER
4. APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER
5. FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
6. REJECTED by EMPLOYEE
7. REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION
8. REJECTED by SUPERVISOR
9. REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER
10. REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER
11. REJECTED by MISSING
12. FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR (rare)
13. FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER (rare)
14. FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION (rare)
15. SAVED by EMPLOYEE (rare)

**States (Payment):**
1. Request Payment
2. Payment Handled

**Process Flow:**

1. An employee **SUBMITS** a declaration.
   - The declaration can be directly **FINAL_APPROVED** by the supervisor (~1536 occurrences) or go through various approval/rejection cycles involving Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, and Supervisor before being final approved.

2. If approved at any stage:
   - It moves to the next approving role (ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER).
   - If approved by Administration or Budget Owner, it can be directly **FINAL_APPROVED** by the supervisor (~5133 + ~2788 occurrences).

3. If rejected at any stage:
   - It moves back to the employee for re-submission (**REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**) or stays in the rejected state with no further action (**REJECTED by MISSING**).
   - Rejections can also happen directly from an approved state (**REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**, **REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**, **REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**).

4. Once a declaration is **FINAL_APPROVED**, the employee can **Request Payment**.
   - After payment is requested, it moves to **Payment Handled**.

5. There are rare occurrences of other state transitions:
   - A declaration can be saved by an employee (**SAVED by EMPLOYEE**).
   - A declaration can be put up for approval directly without going through the usual submission and approval/rejection cycles (**FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR**, **FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER**, **FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION**).

**Performance Metrics:**
- Frequency: The number of occurrences for each state transition.
- Performance: An unknown metric provided for each state transition.

**Notes:**
- The process seems to have multiple paths and loops, indicating a fair amount of flexibility or complexity in handling declarations.
- Some rare states and transitions are present but not well-defined by the given data (e.g., **FOR_APPROVAL**, **SAVED**, **MISSING**).
- The 'performance' metric is unclear without additional context. It could represent time, cost, or another relevant factor for each state transition.
- There's no clear indication of what happens after a declaration is rejected by the missing role or status (**REJECTED by MISSING**).
