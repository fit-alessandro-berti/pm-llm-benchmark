This textual BPMN-like process model encapsulates the activities, sequence flow, decision points, roles, participants, artifacts, inputs, and outputs described in the interviews. It outlines the typical path of an invoice through the approval process, along with potential exceptions and the involvement of different stakeholders. Each interview provides specific details that inform various steps and decisions within the process, such as handling discrepancies and escalation to higher authorities.

The model should be reviewed by process stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness before being used as a basis for creating a visual BPMN diagram. Any inconsistencies or ambiguities from the interviews (e.g., different perspectives on the sequence) would need to be resolved through further dialogue with the interviewees or additional data collection.
