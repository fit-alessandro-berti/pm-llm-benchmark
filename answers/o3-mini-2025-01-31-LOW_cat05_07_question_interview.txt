1. Can you walk me through how the property coordinator verifies the landlord’s documentation and what specific criteria are used to determine if a document is acceptable, outdated, or missing?  
2. How is the decision made to assign a particular property manager—what specific factors are prioritized, and how are workload or geographic specialization weighed against other criteria?  
3. When a landlord has unique requirements (such as furnished or luxury units), how do these requirements affect the onboarding process and what additional steps, if any, are taken?  
4. Could you describe the communication flow between the property coordinator, manager, and landlord, especially when there are follow-up requests or clarifications needed on documentation?  
5. How does the process ensure that the initial meeting between the property manager and the landlord is both comprehensive and structured, and what key elements are discussed to align expectations?  
6. What steps are taken if the property inspection identifies issues with safety or habitability, and how does the property manager coordinate with the landlord and any external contractors to address these issues?  
7. After the property passes inspection, how does the digital marketing team update pricing models and market trends, and what inputs or data sources are used in this evaluation?  
8. With multiple stakeholders involved (photographer, inspector, marketing team, leasing agents), how is the process timed and sequenced to ensure smooth transitions between each phase?  
9. Can you elaborate on the tenant screening process—what criteria are used and how are decisions made when multiple applicants are equally qualified or when there are conflicting tenant requirements?  
10. How are lease negotiations, especially in cases where special conditions or promotional discounts are considered, managed and documented within the process?  
11. In the case of exceptions, such as properties requiring special insurance or custom lease clauses, how is the standard process adapted, and who is responsible for resolving these exceptions?  
12. What quality checks do compliance officers, financial analysts, and the IT department perform, and how are discrepancies or errors communicated and resolved across teams?  
13. Can you provide examples of how the process might differ between different regional offices or property types, and how consistency is maintained across the organization?  
14. How is communication tracked and archived using the internal systems like CRMs and project management tools, and what measures are in place to prevent any miscommunication or loss of critical information?  
15. What feedback mechanisms or process improvement initiatives are in place to continually refine the onboarding process, and how do you incorporate lessons learned from previous onboarding cycles?
