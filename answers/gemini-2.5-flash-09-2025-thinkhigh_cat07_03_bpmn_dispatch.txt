This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** detailing the process for the "Dispatch of goods" from a "Computer Hardware Shop."

The process is structured across three horizontal lanes (swimlanes), defining the roles and areas responsible for the activities:

1.  **Logistics** (Top)
2.  **Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop / Secretary** (Middle)
3.  **Warehouse** (Bottom)

### Process Flow Description

The process begins with the **Start Event: "Ship goods."**

#### 1. Initial Parallel Activities

The start event immediately splits into two parallel threads via a Parallel Gateway (AND Split):

*   **Thread A (Secretary):** Begins with **"Clarify shipment method."**
*   **Thread B (Warehouse):** Begins with **"Package goods."**

#### 2. Warehouse Path (Packaging and Delay Handling)

The "Package goods" activity has an associated **Intermediate Timer Event** labeled **"48 hours."**

*   If the packaging takes longer than 48 hours, an exception path is triggered: **"Notify customer about delay."**
*   Both the main packaging flow and the delay notification flow converge at a Parallel Join Gateway before proceeding.

#### 3. Secretary Path (Administrative and Logistics Decisions)

After "Clarify shipment method," the flow encounters an **Exclusive Gateway (X Split)** asking: **"Special handling?"**

**Path 3A: No Special Handling**

1.  The flow moves to **"Check if insurance is required"** (referencing the "Order details" document and "Customer information" data store).
2.  This leads to an **Inclusive Gateway (Circle/Diamond)**, labeled "If insurance necessary."
    *   **If insurance is necessary:** The activity **"Insure parcel"** is performed in the **Logistics** lane.
    *   **"always" path:** The process continues to **"Write package label"** in the Secretary lane.

3.  The "Insure parcel" activity (Logistics) and the "Write package label" activity (Secretary) synchronize at a **Parallel Join Gateway (AND Join).**

**Path 3B: Yes, Special Handling**

1.  The Secretary performs **"Get 3 offers from logistic companies."**
2.  This is followed by **"Select logistic company and place order."**

#### 4. Synchronization of Administrative Paths

The flow from the standard/insurance path (Path 3A) and the flow from the special handling/logistics path (Path 3B) merge at an **Exclusive Gateway (X Join).**

#### 5. Final Synchronization and Completion

The output from the merged Secretary/Logistics activities meets the output from the Warehouse packaging thread at a final **Parallel Join Gateway (AND Join).** This ensures that both the physical packaging and all necessary administrative/logistical planning are complete.

The final two steps take place in the **Warehouse** lane:

1.  **"Fill out Shipment paperwork"**
2.  **"Move package to pickup area"**

The process concludes with the **End Event: "Shipment prepared."**
