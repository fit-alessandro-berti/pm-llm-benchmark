##  **Justification of Renaming Choices**

### **1. `Initiate Request`  Disambiguated by Channel**
- **Original:** “Initiate Request”
- **Renamed:**
  - **Initiate Request (Online)**
  - **Initiate Request (In-Branch)**

**Why?**  
The same activity appears in both online and in-branch scenarios. The channel of initiation affects the entire workflow and downstream actions (e.g., document verification method, resource involved). Disambiguating by channel improves clarity in process mining and analysis.

---

### **2. `Verify Documents`  Disambiguated by Timing and Context**
- **Original:** “Verify Documents”
- **Renamed:**
  - **Verify Documents (Initial)**
  - **Verify Documents (Post-Submission)**
  - **Verify Documents (Physical)**
  - **Verify Documents (Post-Adjustment)**

**Why?**  
“Verify Documents” occurs multiple times in some cases, but each time it serves a **different purpose**:
  - **Initial verification** is the first check of submitted documents.
  - **Post-submission** verification occurs after the customer provides **additional documents** (e.g., ID scan).
  - **Physical verification** refers specifically to **in-person ID checks**.
  - **Post-adjustment verification** is a re-check **after account corrections**, ensuring consistency.

Disambiguating these helps distinguish between **routine checks**, **corrective checks**, and **different verification methods**.

---

### **3. `Call Customer`  Disambiguated by Purpose**
- **Original:** “Call Customer”
- **Renamed:**
  - **Call Customer (Request Docs)**
  - **Call Customer (Clarify Account)**
  - **Call Customer (Confirm Adjustments)**
  - **Call Customer (Recall to Branch)**

**Why?**  
Calls are made for **very different reasons**:
  - To **request missing documents**.
  - To **clarify account discrepancies**.
  - To **confirm that adjustments were understood or effective**.
  - To **ask a customer to return to the branch**.

Renaming by purpose clarifies the **intent behind each call**, which is critical for analyzing customer experience, compliance, and process efficiency.

---

### **4. `Adjust Account`  Disambiguated by Trigger**
- **Original:** “Adjust Account”
- **Renamed:**
  - **Adjust Account (Post-Call)**
  - **Adjust Account (Post-Info Update)**

**Why?**  
Account adjustments happen for **different reasons**:
  - After a **customer call** to resolve discrepancies.
  - After **receiving missing or updated information** (e.g., in the branch scenario).

This distinction helps identify **what triggered the adjustment**, which is valuable for root cause analysis and process optimization.

---

### **5. `Approve Request`  Unified as Final Step**
- **Original:** “Approve Request”
- **Renamed:** **Approve Request (Final)**

**Why?**  
In all cases, this is the **final approval step**, performed by a **Supervisor**. Since its meaning and position are consistent across all cases, it was kept with a minor clarification to indicate it is the **final approval**.

##  **Benefits of Disambiguated Activity Names**

| Benefit                                      | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Improved Process Understanding**           | Analysts can see the **true flow** of events, not just repeated labels.     |
| **Accurate Process Mining**                  | Mining tools can correctly group and differentiate similar but distinct events. |
| **Better Root Cause Analysis**               | Knowing *why* an activity occurs helps trace issues to their source.         |
| **Enhanced Customer Experience Analysis**    | Differentiating call purposes allows for measuring customer touchpoints.    |
| **Compliance & Auditability**               | Clear names help trace decisions and actions back to their triggers.        |

###  **Conclusion**

By renaming recurring activities to reflect their **context, timing, and intent**, we transform a ambiguous log into a **semantically rich dataset**. This enables far more accurate **process mining**, **bottleneck detection**, and **workflow optimization**—especially in complex, multi-channel support environments like this financial services company.
