To construct a Log Skeleton for the described order fulfillment process, we analyze the dependencies and constraints among the activities based on the provided definitions. The result is a Python dictionary with the appropriate constraints.

###  Step-by-step Justification:

#### 1. **Equivalence**
- No explicit equivalence is mentioned; no activities must occur the same number of times if one occurs.  
   Leave as an empty set.

#### 2. **Always Before**
- **Reserve Items (RI)** must come after **Check Availability (CA)** — you can’t reserve items unless you know they are available.
- **Pick Items (PI)** must come after **Reserve Items (RI)** — items must be reserved before being picked.
- **Quality Check (QC)** must come after **Pick Items (PI)** — items need to be picked before checking them.
- **Pack Order (PO)** must come after **Quality Check (QC)** — items must pass QC before packing.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** must come after **Pack Order (PO)** — can't generate a label without a packed order.
- **Dispatch (D)** must come after **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** — dispatching requires a label.
- **Invoice Customer (IC)** may occur after **Dispatch (D)** — typical business flow.
- **Record Payment (RP)** must come after **Invoice Customer (IC)** — payment is made after invoicing.

So, we get the following **Always Before** relationships:

```
(RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP)
```

But **Always Before** means: *If the second activity occurs, the first must have occurred before.* So, for example, `(CA, RI)` means if RI occurs, CA must have occurred before.

Hence, we reverse the above to get correct ordering for **Always Before**:

```
(RI, CA), (PI, RI), (QC, PI), (PO, QC), (GSL, PO), (D, GSL), (IC, D), (RP, IC)
```

#### 3. **Always After**
- **Check Availability (CA)** must be followed by **Reserve Items (RI)**.
- **Reserve Items (RI)**  **Pick Items (PI)**.
- **Pick Items (PI)**  **Quality Check (QC)**.
- **Quality Check (QC)**  **Pack Order (PO)**.
- **Pack Order (PO)**  **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**  **Dispatch (D)**.
- **Dispatch (D)**  **Invoice Customer (IC)**.
- **Invoice Customer (IC)**  **Record Payment (RP)**.

These are the direct sequential dependencies.

 So, **Always After** is:

```
(CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP)
```

#### 4. **Never Together**
- There are no obvious mutually exclusive activities in this process.
 Leave as empty set.

#### 5. **Activity Occurrences**
Assume that in any valid case:
- All activities occur **exactly once**, except:
  - **Receive Order (RO)** always starts the process.
  - Some optional activities might occur 0 or 1 times, but in a standard flow, all occur once.

We'll assume all activities occur **once** per case unless stated otherwise.

 Set all to `{1}`.

#### 6. **Directly Follows**
This is a stricter version of **Always After** — activity A must be **immediately** followed by B.

From the sequential flow:
```
CA  RI, RI  PI, PI  QC, QC  PO, PO  GSL, GSL  D, D  IC, IC  RP
```

 These are also **Directly Follows** relationships.
