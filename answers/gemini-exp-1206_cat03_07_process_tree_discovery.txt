-> ( 'Receive Application (RA)',
     -> ( 'Validate Form (VF)',
          -> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
               * ( -> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                        'Validate Form (VF)' ),

                         'Archive Case (AC)' ) ) ) ) )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`-> ( 'Receive Application (RA)', ... )`:** The process always starts with "Receive Application (RA)".
2. **`-> ( 'Validate Form (VF)', ... )`:** After receiving the application, the form is validated.
3. **`-> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', ... )`:** Eligibility is assessed after form validation.
4. **`* ( -> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' ), 'tau' )`:** This is the loop.
    *   **`-> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' )`:** If missing information is detected, it's requested, and then the form is re-validated. This sequence can repeat multiple times.
    *   **`'tau'`:** Represents the option to exit the loop (no more missing info).
5. **`-> ( 'Approval Decision (AD)', ... )`:** After the loop (or if no missing info was found), an approval decision is made.
6. **`-> ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 'Archive Case (AC)' )`:** Finally, a confirmation is sent, and the case is archived.

This process tree effectively captures the sequential flow of the main activities while allowing for the observed loop of requesting missing information and re-validating the form, providing a good balance of fitness and simplicity for the given event log.
