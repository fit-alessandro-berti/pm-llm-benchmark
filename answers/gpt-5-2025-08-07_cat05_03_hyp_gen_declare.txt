Anomalies and contradictions in the DECLARE model
- Noncoexistence(E, C) versus Existence(C): Because C must exist in every case, noncoexistence(E, C) bans E from every case. This effectively prohibits evaluation entirely.
- Responded-existence(E  A) becomes moot: Since E cannot occur (per above), the E  A constraint is vacuously true and adds no real control. Even if E were allowed, this constraint is too weak: it doesn’t require A to precede E, only to co-occur somewhere in the trace.
- Missing core steps and ordering: There is no requirement that A, E, P, or N exist, nor any ordering among them. As written, a case like R  C is fully compliant (and E is disallowed), which undermines the intended flow R  A  E  P  N  C.
- Precedence(C, R) is redundant/weak with Init(R): Init(R) already forces R to be first. Precedence(C, R) adds no practical restriction beyond what Init(R) ensures.
- No “C is last” or single-close constraint: There is no constraint that C is the last event, nor that it occurs exactly once. Post-close activities and multiple closings are allowed.
- No link from approval/notification to closing: Nothing requires P before C, or N before C, or even that P and N exist.
- Potentially illogical sequencing permitted: Responded-existence(E  A) permits E before A (if E were allowed). This violates the expected real-world dependency that an adjuster must be assigned before evaluation.

Hypotheses about why these anomalies exist
- Requirement drift or misinterpretation: The model may have been updated piecemeal; a later “must close every case” rule (existence(C)) was added without reconciling its impact on earlier constraints involving E.
- Incorrect encoding of business logic: Noncoexistence(E, C) could be a mistaken attempt to prevent evaluation after closing, but it was encoded as a blanket mutual exclusion instead of a “C after E” or “E before C” constraint.
- Data-driven mining issues: If constraints were discovered from incomplete or biased logs (e.g., few or no E events), the miner might infer noncoexistence(E, C) or omit required responses incorrectly.
- Overemphasis on throughput: Pressures to close claims quickly may have resulted in constraints that implicitly allow skipping A/E/P/N, with C always present.
- Technical ambiguity in event semantics: If “E” was performed under different labels or by systems not captured in events, the model could exclude E unintentionally and add unrelated constraints that do not reflect reality.

SQL-based verification strategies

A. Sanity checks on start/close
1) Cases whose first event is not R (violates Init(R)):
with first_evt as (
  select claim_id,
         activity,
         row_number() over (partition by claim_id order by timestamp, event_id) as rn
  from claim_events
)
select claim_id, activity as first_activity
from first_evt
where rn = 1 and activity <> 'R';

2) Claims with no close C at all (tests the “C must exist” assumption against data):
select c.claim_id
from claims c
left join claim_events ce on ce.claim_id = c.claim_id and ce.activity = 'C'
group by c.claim_id
having count(ce.event_id) = 0;

3) Multiple closes per claim:
select claim_id, count(*) as close_events
from claim_events
where activity = 'C'
group by claim_id
having count(*) > 1;

4) Events occurring after the last close (C not last):
with last_c as (
  select claim_id, max(timestamp) as last_c_time
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'C'
  group by claim_id
)
select e.claim_id, e.activity, e.timestamp, e.resource
from claim_events e
join last_c lc on lc.claim_id = e.claim_id
where e.timestamp > lc.last_c_time;

B. Direct checks of the contradictory E/C constraints
5) Claims closed without any evaluation (what the current model effectively enforces):
select claim_id
from claim_events
group by claim_id
having sum((activity = 'C')::int) > 0
   and sum((activity = 'E')::int) = 0;

6) Claims where evaluation and closing coexist (would violate noncoexistence(E, C)):
select claim_id
from claim_events
group by claim_id
having sum((activity = 'E')::int) > 0
   and sum((activity = 'C')::int) > 0;

C. Assignment/evaluation consistency
7) Cases with E but no A (violates intended logic and the responded-existence intention):
select claim_id
from claim_events
group by claim_id
having sum((activity = 'E')::int) > 0
   and sum((activity = 'A')::int) = 0;

8) Evaluation occurring before assignment:
with t as (
  select claim_id,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'A') as a_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'E') as e_time
  from claim_events
  group by claim_id
)
select claim_id, a_time, e_time
from t
where e_time is not null and (a_time is null or e_time < a_time);

D. Approval/notification ordering relative to close
9) Close before approval or no approval at all:
with t as (
  select claim_id,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'P') as p_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'C') as c_time
  from claim_events
  group by claim_id
)
select claim_id, p_time, c_time
from t
where c_time is not null and (p_time is null or p_time > c_time);

10) Close before notification or no notification at all:
with t as (
  select claim_id,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'N') as n_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'C') as c_time
  from claim_events
  group by claim_id
)
select claim_id, n_time, c_time
from t
where c_time is not null and (n_time is null or n_time > c_time);

E. Full intended sequence coverage and order (diagnostics)
11) Presence and order of R  A  E  P  N  C:
with t as (
  select claim_id,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'R') as r_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'A') as a_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'E') as e_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'P') as p_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'N') as n_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'C') as c_time
  from claim_events
  group by claim_id
)
select claim_id, r_time, a_time, e_time, p_time, n_time, c_time
from t
where not (
  r_time is not null and a_time is not null and e_time is not null and
  p_time is not null and n_time is not null and c_time is not null and
  r_time <= a_time and a_time <= e_time and e_time <= p_time and
  p_time <= n_time and n_time <= c_time
);

F. Adjuster assignment/evaluation alignment
12) If A.additional_info contains assigned_adjuster_id=NNN, check the evaluator matches the assigned adjuster:
with assigned as (
  select claim_id,
         max(substring(additional_info from 'assigned_adjuster_id=(\d+)')::int) as assigned_adjuster_id
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'A'
  group by claim_id
),
evaluator as (
  select ce.claim_id, adj.adjuster_id as evaluator_id, ce.resource as evaluator_name
  from claim_events ce
  join adjusters adj on adj.name = ce.resource
  where ce.activity = 'E'
)
select a.claim_id, a.assigned_adjuster_id, e.evaluator_id, e.evaluator_name
from assigned a
join evaluator e on e.claim_id = a.claim_id
where a.assigned_adjuster_id is not null
  and e.evaluator_id is not null
  and a.assigned_adjuster_id <> e.evaluator_id;

13) If A.additional_info contains assigned_adjuster=<name>, compare to evaluator’s name:
with assigned as (
  select claim_id,
         substring(additional_info from 'assigned_adjuster=([^;]+)') as assigned_adjuster_name
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'A'
),
evaluator as (
  select claim_id, resource as evaluator_name
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'E'
)
select a.claim_id, a.assigned_adjuster_name, e.evaluator_name
from assigned a
join evaluator e using (claim_id)
where a.assigned_adjuster_name is not null
  and e.evaluator_name is not null
  and a.assigned_adjuster_name <> e.evaluator_name;

14) Evaluator specialization matches claim_type (e.g., home_insurance  home, auto_insurance  auto):
select ce.claim_id, c.claim_type, adj.name as evaluator, adj.specialization
from claim_events ce
join claims c on c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
join adjusters adj on adj.name = ce.resource
where ce.activity = 'E'
  and (
    (c.claim_type = 'home_insurance' and adj.specialization <> 'home') or
    (c.claim_type = 'auto_insurance' and adj.specialization <> 'auto')
  );

G. Extra diagnostic on precedence(C, R)
15) Close recorded before receive (tests data quality against precedence/initialization assumptions):
with t as (
  select claim_id,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'R') as r_time,
         min(timestamp) filter (where activity = 'C') as c_time
  from claim_events
  group by claim_id
)
select claim_id, r_time, c_time
from t
where c_time is not null and (r_time is null or c_time < r_time);

These checks will reveal whether the contradictions and loopholes in the model are mirrored in the actual event data and where the process deviates from the intended flow.
