Looking at the timeline, most tickets move through the process in under a few hours, but a couple stand out. Case 102 takes about 25 hours from receipt to close, and Case 105 stretches to roughly 71 hours. These are clearly the outliers.

For Case 102, the pattern is an escalation to a Level-2 agent after the Level-1 agent is assigned, followed by a large gap—nearly three hours—before the Level-2 agent begins investigating. That gap likely reflects either resource unavailability or handover delays. Then there's an overnight wait before resolution, adding to the total time.

Case 105 shows a similar escalation, but the delay is far more pronounced. After escalation, there's a long pause before the next investigation, then another overnight wait before resolution. The two escalations in this log both introduce extended idle periods, suggesting that specialized agents may not be immediately available or that the handoff process is inefficient.

The common thread is that escalations correlate with large time gaps between activities. If Level-2 agents are a bottleneck or if the transition between agents isn't smooth, these delays compound. Reducing resolution times would likely involve ensuring faster availability of specialized resources, streamlining the escalation process, or even empowering Level-1 agents with more tools to handle complex cases without escalation.
