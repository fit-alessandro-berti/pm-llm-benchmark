## Analysis of Loan Application Process Event Logs:

**Normative Violations:**

* **Case 2:** This case violates the normative process by skipping the Credit Check before performing the Risk Assessment. The correct sequence requires the Credit Check to happen before any risk evaluation. Additionally, it violates the rule by finalizing documentation after a rejection.

**Desiderata Deviations:**

* **Case 1:** While adhering to the strict rules, it took longer than the recommended 48 hours to inform the applicant. This might indicate a delay in the decision-making process.  
* **Case 3:**  This case exhibits two desiderata deviations:
    - The Credit Check took over 24 hours after the application, exceeding the recommended timeframe.
    - The applicant wasn't informed within 48 hours of the loan decision, again exceeding the recommended timeframe.
    - The case also potentially violates a desideratum by lacking a Follow-up Call before closing.

**Possible Interpretations & Justifications:**

* **Case 2:** The violation might be due to human error, where the order of tasks was inadvertently reversed. It's possible the Risk Assessment was mistakenly performed before the Credit Check due to a lack of awareness about the strict rule. The documentation finalization after rejection could be a similar mistake, highlighting the need for clearer guidance or double-checking protocols. 

* **Case 1 & 3:** The delays in informing the applicant could be caused by various factors:
    - Complexities in the applicant's financial situation requiring additional scrutinization.
    - A backlog of applications leading to processing delays.
    - Systems or internal procedures limiting the speed of decision-making.

**Recommendations:**

To improve process adherence and efficiency, it's crucial to:

* **Reinforce training**:  Ensure staff are thoroughly trained on the strict sequence and rationale behind each step.
* **Implement check-and-balance systems:**  Introduce automated or manual checks to ensure the correct order of activities is followed. Error-prevention mechanisms.
* **Streamline processes**: Investigate potential bottlenecks causing delays in decision-making and communication.
* **Encourage adherence to desiderata**:  While not strictly enforced, promoting desirable practices like timely credit checks and communication will lead to a smoother customer experience.

* **Track deviations and analyze**: Regularly review the logs for deviations and identify recurring patterns to pinpoint areas requiring further improvement.
