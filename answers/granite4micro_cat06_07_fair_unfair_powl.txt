Below are two concrete **POWL models** (partiallyordered workflows) that capture the hiring process described in the prompt.  

Both models use the same activity labels from the description and include loops for datacompleteness checks as well as a sequential chain of skill assessment  cultural fit  managerial review  final decision.

## 1 Model with Potential Unfairness (`biased_workflow.powl`)

**Structure**

```
ReceiveApplication
        
DataCompletenessCheck (loop)
        
RequestMoreInfo  (optional)    ask the applicant for missing data or extra details  
        
SkillAssessment
        
CulturalFitCheck           X CommunityAffiliationCheck
                             
ManagerialReview  FinalDecision
```

**Explanation**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ReceiveApplication** | The core entry point – the system obtains a candidate’s CV. |
| **DataCompletenessCheck** (loop) | An automated parser checks for essential fields (e.g., education, work experience). If anything is missing, the process loops back to **RequestMoreInfo**, asking the applicant for additional data before proceeding. |
| **RequestMoreInfo** (optional) | The candidate supplies any missing information; after which control returns to **DataCompletenessCheck** until all required fields are present. |
| **SkillAssessment** | An automated test is run that scores domainspecific knowledge. Low scores may automatically disqualify the applicant, while higher scores allow them to continue. |
| **CulturalFitCheck** (XOR) | At this stage two parallel branches exist: <br>• **CommunityAffiliationCheck**: If the candidate indicates membership in a recognized local network (e.g., “Global Business Leaders Club”) or is flagged as a local resident, they receive an *implicit uplift* toward cultural fit. <br>• The alternative branch simply evaluates cultural fit without any biasinducing factor. |
| **ManagerialReview** | A human reviewer examines borderline candidates and decides whether to approve the hire. |
| **FinalDecision** | The ultimate go/nogo decision is made by the hiring manager. |

**Why this introduces unfairness**

- The **CommunityAffiliationCheck** branch gives a subtle advantage to applicants who are affiliated with certain local groups, even if they meet all other criteria.
- This creates an “unfair tilt” toward communitylinked candidates, violating transparency and fairness.

## 2 Model Without Unfairness (`fair_workflow.powl`)

**Structure**

```
ReceiveApplication
        
DataCompletenessCheck (loop)
        
RequestMoreInfo  (optional)    ask for missing data  
        
SkillAssessment
        
CulturalFitCheck
        
ManagerialReview  FinalDecision
```

**Explanation**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ReceiveApplication** | Same as above – the system receives a CV. |
| **DataCompletenessCheck** (loop) | Automated parser checks for key fields; if any are missing, the process loops back to **RequestMoreInfo** until all required data is supplied. |
| **RequestMoreInfo** | Candidate supplies missing details, then control returns to **DataCompletenessCheck**. |
| **SkillAssessment** | Same automated skill test and scoring mechanism as above. |
| **CulturalFitCheck** | Only a single branch evaluates cultural fit without any communityaffiliation bias. The reviewer assesses the candidate’s alignment with GlobalTeq Solutions’ values uniformly. |
| **ManagerialReview** | Human decision maker reviews borderline cases. |
| **FinalDecision** | The final go/nogo choice is made by the hiring manager, based solely on a meritbased cultural fit evaluation. |

**Why this model avoids bias**

- By removing the **XOR CommunityAffiliationCheck** branch and keeping only one path for cultural fit, no applicants receive an automatic advantage simply because they belong to a particular local community or hold certain affiliations.
- All decisions are made on the same meritbased criteria.

### How to Use These Models in pm4py

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, Transition, SilentTransition

# 1 Biased workflow (contains potential unfairness)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")   # loop node
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# XOR branch where one path adds a community uplift (unfair bias)
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Build the biased model
biased_graph = StrictPartialOrder()
biased_graph.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
biased_graph.order.add_edge(RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck)   # loop

biased_graph.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
biased_graph.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, XorOperator(CulturalFitCheck,
                                                               CommunityAffiliationCheck,
                                                               skip))  # XOR
biased_graph.order.add_edge(CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview)

# OR simply the alternative path (no bias):
biased_graph.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
biased_graph.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
biased_graph.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# 2 Fair workflow (removes the XOR branch)
Fair = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
Fair.review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
Fair.decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

fair_graph = StrictPartialOrder()
fair_graph.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
fair_graph.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, Fair)
fair_graph.order.add_edge(Fair, ManagerialReview)
fair_graph.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Export / further analysis can be performed with pm4py's workflow tools
```

*Note*: The exact `OperatorPOWL` construction for the XOR branch uses PM4PY’s **Operator.XOR** syntax to denote mutually exclusive alternatives. In the textual description we labeled this as a “CommunityAffiliationCheck” activity.

These two models demonstrate how subtle biases can appear in an otherwise transparent process and how they can be eliminated by enforcing a single, unbiased culturalfit evaluation path.
