## Explanation of Logic and Grouping

### **1. Case Identification:**
- I identified **one case** (Case ID = 1) because all events occur within a single, continuous session of the user working on multiple documents and emails.
- The user starts with **Document1.docx**, moves to an email, then a PDF report, then the budget spreadsheet, and returns to the main document before closing it.
- The sequence shows a **coherent workflow** involving document editing, email replies, and report review, all within a single working session.

### **2. Activity Naming:**
- I translated low-level actions like `FOCUS`, `TYPING`, and `SWITCH` into **higher-level activities** such as:
  - **Start Editing Document1** (from `FOCUS` event).
  - **Typing in Document1** (from `TYPING` with content).
  - **Save Document1** (from `SAVE` event).
  - **Switch to Email** (from `SWITCH` event).
  - **Reply to Email** (from `CLICK` with `Action=Reply to Email`).
  - **Send Email** (from `CLICK` with `Action=Send Email`).
  - **Highlight Key Findings** (from `HIGHLIGHT` event).
- This standardization makes the log **more readable and analyzable** for process mining tools.

### **3. Event Attributes:**
- **Case ID** is consistent across all events in the single case.
- **Activity Name** is standardized and semantically meaningful.
- **Timestamp** is preserved from the original system log.
- **App** and **Window** are included as additional attributes to provide context for each activity.

### **4. Coherent Narrative:**
- The user works on a document (`Document1.docx`), saves it, then replies to an email, reviews a report, edits a budget spreadsheet, and returns to the document to make a final edit and save it before closing.
- This narrative reflects a **typical business process** involving document creation, communication, and data analysis.

---

### Summary:
- I grouped all events into **one case** based on the **coherence and continuity** of the user's work session.
- I standardized low-level actions into **higher-level process activities** to make the log more interpretable.
- The final event log is **ready for process mining analysis**, such as identifying process bottlenecks, deviations, or common patterns in user behavior.
