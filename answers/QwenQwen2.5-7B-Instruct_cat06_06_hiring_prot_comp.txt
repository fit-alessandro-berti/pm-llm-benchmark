To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, let's analyze the process variants and their performance. Here are the key differences and insights:

### 1. **Frequency of Variants**:
   - **Unprotected Group**: More frequency of variants with "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination." This suggests that the more complex and detailed examination processes are more common in the unprotected group.
   - **Protected Group**: A broader range of simpler and quicker processes involving fewer examinations, such as just "Register at ER" or "Register at FD" leading directly to discharge.

### 2. **Performance (Execution Time)**:
   - **Unprotected Group**: 
     - Higher performance times in many longer variants, indicating more extensive and possibly more complex treatment processes.
     - Variants with multiple stages like "Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" exhibit higher performance times (e.g., 320003.346, 320004.432).
   - **Protected Group**: 
     - Lower performance times in most variants, suggesting simpler and quicker processes. Even some complex variants (like those involving "Expert Examination") have lower performance times (e.g., 260006.914).

### 3. **Specific Process Variants**:
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - Variants like "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" and "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" are more frequent and have higher performance times.
   - **Protected Group**:
     - Shorter variants such as "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" and "Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" are more common and have lower performance times.

### 4. **General Trends**:
   - **Higher Complexity and Longer Durations**: The unprotected group often goes through more detailed and extensive examination and treatment processes, which may imply a higher level of care but also longer execution times.
   - **Simpler and Faster Processes**: The protected group tends to have processes that are quicker and less complex, possibly leading to shorter overall execution times.

### Conclusion:
The main differences lie in the depth and complexity of the treatment processes:

- **Unprotected Group**: Higher frequency of variants involving multiple detailed examinations (e.g., Expert Examination, Thorough Examination), which likely result in more time-intensive processes (higher performance times).
- **Protected Group**: Predominance of shorter, simpler variants leading to quicker processes (lower performance times).

These differences suggest that the unprotected group receives a more thorough and potentially time-consuming care process, while the protected group receives quicker and simpler care. This disparity could be due to various factors such as resource allocation, prioritization of care, or systemic biases in the healthcare system. It would be beneficial to investigate these process differences further to understand the underlying reasons for these discrepancies.
