# Comprehensive Event Log for Process Mining

Below is the integrated event log derived from the ERP tables. Each row represents a single event in the order-to-cash process.

## Assumptions Made:
1. **Case ID**: `order_id` serves as the unique case identifier
2. **Activity Names**: Derived logically from table contexts
3. **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered by timestamp within each case
4. **Item Picking Events**: Each line item generates a separate "Item Picked" event
5. **Delivery Events**: Each delivery generates both "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events
6. **Invoice-Payment Link**: Payments are linked to orders through invoices
7. **Missing Data**: Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment records (incomplete process)
