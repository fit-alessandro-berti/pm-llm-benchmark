<think>
The user wants a Python dictionary representing a "temporal profile" for a specific supply chain process.
The process has 10 activities: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS.

**Key definitions from the prompt:**
1.  **Temporal Profile**: A model describing the average and standard deviation of times between *couples of activities that eventually follow each other*. This means for a trace `<A, B, C, D>`, we consider `(A,B)`, `(A,C)`, `(A,D)`, `(B,C)`, `(B,D)`, `(C,D)`. It's not just direct successors.
2.  **Structure**: A Python dictionary `{('Act1', 'Act2'): (avg_time, stdev)}`.
3.  **Scenario**: Global supply chain for high-tech electronics.
4.  **Constraint**: Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the *prompt* (which I am writing the response to, so I need to *generate* the numbers based on estimation/intuition about supply chains).
5.  **Requirement**: The dictionary should include a representative subset, ensuring complexity by considering pairs separated by multiple steps (eventually follows, not just directly follows).

**Estimating Times (Intuition):**

*   **SS (Supplier Selection) to OP (Order Placement):** Short. Maybe days. Let's say 2-3 days.
*   **OP (Order Placement) to RC (Receive Components):** Long. Lead times in electronics can be weeks. Let's say 2-4 weeks.
*   **RC (Receive Components) to QI (Quality Inspection):** Short. Unloading and checking. Hours or a day.
*   **QI (Quality Inspection) to CA (Component Assembly):** Short/Medium. Moving to line. Maybe 1 day.
*   **CA (Component Assembly) to PT (Product Testing):** Short. Continuous flow. Maybe hours.
*   **PT (Product Testing) to PK (Packaging):** Immediate/Short. Hours.
*   **PK (Packaging) to WS (Warehouse Storage):** Short. Hours.
*   **WS (Warehouse Storage) to DT (Distribution):** Variable. Depends on shipping schedules. Days to weeks. Let's say 1 week average.
*   **DT (Distribution) to AS (After-Sales Support):** Very long. This is the usage phase. Months or years. *Wait*, looking at standard process logs, usually AS happens after a significant delay relative to the manufacturing steps. However, in a "trace", this might be years later. Let's assume the trace captures the lifecycle. The time between DT and AS could be months (warranty period start) or years. Let's pick a reasonable timeframe if the process is considered "post-sales support initiation". If AS is triggered immediately after sale for installation, it's short. If it's support, it's long. Let's assume AS refers to the *initiation* of support services or installation support, which happens shortly after delivery (days/weeks), or it's the "event" of support happening. The prompt implies a trace. If the trace ends with AS, it's the time from DT to the support request. That is highly variable. Let's assume AS here means "Installation/Setup" or "Support Initiation" which follows DT by a few days. Or, if it's random support calls, the stdev would be massive. Let's stick to the immediate post-sales phase (installation/setup) for the "process execution" definition, or assume a massive variance. Let's go with a shorter timeframe (days) for "Setup/Onboarding" to keep the numbers manageable, or acknowledge the long gap.
    *   *Alternative interpretation*: Maybe AS is a service activity logged much later. If so, avg is huge (months/years), stdev is huge. Let's stick to a more "process log" friendly interpretation where AS might be installation support or a feedback call soon after delivery. Let's define it as "Post-Sale Check-in/Setup" happening roughly a week after delivery.

**Calculating "Eventually Follows" (Non-direct pairs):**

I need to combine these estimates.

*   **Time Units**: Seconds are used in the example. I will convert days/weeks to seconds for the dictionary values to look like the example.
    *   1 day  86,400 seconds.
    *   1 week  604,800 seconds.

*   **Pairs to generate:**

    1.  **Direct Follows:**
        *   **(SS, OP):** Decision making. ~2 days. Stdev ~0.5 days.
            *   Avg: 172,800. Stdev: 43,200.
        *   **(OP, RC):** Shipping/Lead time. ~21 days (3 weeks). Stdev ~7 days (variability).
            *   Avg: 1,814,400. Stdev: 604,800.
        *   **(RC, QI):** Internal logistics. ~0.5 days. Stdev 0.1 days.
            *   Avg: 43,200. Stdev: 8,640.
        *   **(QI, CA):** Queueing for assembly. ~1 day. Stdev 0.5 days.
            *   Avg: 86,400. Stdev: 43,200.
        *   **(CA, PT):** Immediate. ~4 hours. Stdev 1 hour.
            *   Avg: 14,400. Stdev: 3,600.
        *   **(PT, PK):** Immediate. ~2 hours. Stdev 0.5 hours.
            *   Avg: 7,200. Stdev: 1,800.
        *   **(PK, WS):** Logistics. ~6 hours. Stdev 2 hours.
            *   Avg: 21,600. Stdev: 7,200.
        *   **(WS, DT):** Wait for truck/order. ~3 days. Stdev 2 days.
            *   Avg: 259,200. Stdev: 172,800.
        *   **(DT, AS):** Delivery + Setup. ~5 days. Stdev 2 days.
            *   Avg: 432,000. Stdev: 172,800.

    2.  **Eventually Follows (Gaps):**
        *   **(SS, RC):** SS -> OP -> RC. Avg = SS->OP + OP->RC.
            *   Avg: 172,800 + 1,814,400  1,987,200.
            *   Stdev: Sum of variances? Or roughly sum of stdevs? In process mining, stdev isn't additive like that, but for estimation:
            *   sqrt(43k^2 + 600k^2)  606,000. Let's just estimate a slightly higher stdev than the longest component. Let's say ~650,000.
        *   **(OP, CA):** OP -> RC -> QI -> CA.
            *   Avg: 21d + 0.5d + 1d = 22.5 days.
            *   Stdev: High (dominated by OP->RC). ~7.5 days.
            *   Secs: Avg ~1,944,000. Stdev ~650,000.
        *   **(RC, PT):** RC -> QI -> CA -> PT.
            *   Avg: 0.5d + 1d + 4h  1.7 days.
            *   Stdev: Low compared to lead times. ~0.6 days.
            *   Secs: Avg ~150,000. Stdev ~50,000.
        *   **(SS, DT):** Whole process practically.
            *   Sum of averages: ~2d + 21d + 0.5d + 1d + 4h + 2h + 6h + 3d  28 days.
            *   Stdev: Very high. ~10 days.
            *   Secs: Avg ~2,400,000. Stdev ~900,000.
        *   **(CA, WS):** CA -> PT -> PK -> WS.
            *   Avg: 4h + 2h + 6h = 12 hours (0.5 days).
            *   Stdev: Low. ~3 hours.
            *   Secs: Avg ~43,200. Stdev ~10,800.

**Drafting the Dictionary:**

I will select a mix of direct and "eventually follows" pairs to satisfy the complexity requirement.

*   ('SS', 'OP'): Short, low variance.
*   ('OP', 'RC'): Long, high variance (shipping).
*   ('RC', 'QI'): Short, low variance.
*   ('QI', 'CA'): Short, medium variance.
*   ('CA', 'PT'): Very short.
*   ('SS', 'RC'): Eventual. Sum of SS-OP and OP-RC.
*   ('OP', 'CA'): Eventual. Sum of OP-RC, RC-QI, QI-CA.
*   ('RC', 'PT'): Eventual.
*   ('CA', 'WS'): Eventual.
*   ('PT', 'DT'): Eventual (skips PK, WS).
*   ('SS', 'AS'): Eventual (End-to-end).

Let's refine the numbers for the final output to ensure they look realistic (seconds).

1.  ('SS', 'OP'): 3 days (259,200), Stdev 1 day (86,400).
2.  ('OP', 'RC'): 14 days (1,209,600), Stdev 5 days (432,000).
3.  ('RC', 'QI'): 4 hours (14,400), Stdev 1 hour (3,600).
4.  ('CA', 'PT'): 2 hours (7,200), Stdev 30 mins (1,800).
5.  ('WS', 'DT'): 2 days (172,800), Stdev 1 day (86,400).
6.  ('SS', 'RC'): (SS->OP + OP->RC). ~17 days. (1,468,800). Stdev ~6 days (518,400).
7.  ('OP', 'PT'): Long gap. (OP->...->PT). ~15 days + 0.5 day. ~15.5 days. (1,339,200). Stdev ~5 days.
8.  ('QI', 'PK'): (QI->CA->PT->PK). ~1 day + 0.5 day. ~1.5 days. (129,600). Stdev ~0.5 days.
9.  ('SS', 'DT'): Full cycle. ~30 days. (2,592,000). Stdev ~8 days.
10. ('DT', 'AS'): Support call/setup. ~7 days. (604,800). Stdev 3 days.

**Formatting:**
The output must be a Python dictionary. I will write the code block.

Let's check the definitions again.
"A deviation occurs when the observed time... is either significantly lower than (AVG - ZETA * STDEV) or significantly higher than (AVG + ZETA * STDEV)."
This part of the prompt explains the usage, I don't need to implement the check, just provide the profile data.

**Final Selection of Pairs:**
Direct:
- ('SS', 'OP')
- ('OP', 'RC')
- ('RC', 'QI')
- ('QI', 'CA')
- ('CA', 'PT')
- ('PT', 'PK')
- ('PK', 'WS')
- ('WS', 'DT')
- ('DT', 'AS')

Eventually Follows (Complexity):
- ('SS', 'RC') (SS->OP->RC)
- ('OP', 'QI') (OP->RC->QI)
- ('RC', 'PT') (RC->QI->CA->PT)
- ('CA', 'WS') (CA->PT->PK->WS)
- ('SS', 'DT') (End-to-End excluding AS)
- ('OP', 'AS') (Order to Support)

I will format this into the final Python dictionary. I will ensure the numbers are reasonable for "High-tech electronics" (which often have longer lead times for components, but fast assembly).

*Refining numbers:*
('SS', 'OP'): 172,800 (2 days), 43,200 (0.5 days)
('OP', 'RC'): 1,296,000 (15 days), 432,000 (5 days)
('RC', 'QI'): 43,200 (0.5 days), 14,400 (4 hours)
('QI', 'CA'): 86,400 (1 day), 43,200 (0.5 days)
('CA', 'PT'): 10,800 (3 hours), 3,600 (1 hour)
('PT', 'PK'): 7,200 (2 hours), 1,800 (30 min)
('PK', 'WS'): 21,600 (6 hours), 7,200 (2 hours)
('WS', 'DT'): 259,200 (3 days), 172,800 (2 days)
('DT', 'AS'): 604,800 (1 week), 259,200 (3 days)

Eventual:
('SS', 'RC'): ~17 days. (1,468,800, 475,200) - Var is sum of vars roughly.
('OP', 'PT'): OP to Test. ~17 days. (1,468,800, 475,200).
('RC', 'PK'): Receive to Pack. ~2 days. (172,800, 86,400).
('CA', 'DT'): Assembly to Dist. ~3-4 days. (345,600, 172,800).
('SS', 'AS'): Whole chain. ~35 days. (3,024,000, 864,000).

I will generate the Python code now.
