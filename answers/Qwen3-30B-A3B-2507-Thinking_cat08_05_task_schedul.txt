# Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

To comprehensively analyze Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling performance, I would implement a systematic process mining approach using their MES event logs. Here's my methodology:

**Job Flow Reconstruction & Analysis:**
- Use process mining tools (e.g., ProM, Celonis) to reconstruct the actual job flow using the "Case ID" and "Activity/Task" columns.
- Create a process map showing the actual routing paths of jobs through the shop floor, comparing them against the planned routings to identify deviations.
- Apply conformance checking to identify frequent deviations from planned workflows.

**Key Metrics & Techniques:**
- **Job Flow Times & Lead Times:** Calculate flow time (time from job release to completion) and lead time (time from job release to due date) using timestamp analysis. Apply statistical analysis (histograms, box plots) to understand distributions and identify outliers.
- **Task Waiting Times:** Calculate queue time for each task as (Start Time - Entry Time) using "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events. Analyze waiting times by machine, by priority level, and by time of day.
- **Resource Utilization:** Calculate:
  - *Productive Time*: Sum of all "Task Start" to "Task End" durations
  - *Idle Time*: Time between "Task End" and next "Task Start" (or "Queue Entry")
  - *Setup Time*: Duration between "Setup Start" and "Setup End" events
  - *Utilization Rate*: Productive Time / (Productive Time + Idle Time + Setup Time)
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** For each machine, create a transition matrix showing setup times between job types (e.g., JOB-6998 to JOB-7001). Calculate average setup time for each transition pair and identify patterns (e.g., setups between similar materials are faster).
- **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:** Calculate tardiness as max(0, Actual Completion Date - Due Date). Analyze tardiness distribution and identify patterns (e.g., high tardiness for medium priority jobs).
- **Disruption Impact Analysis:** Use event logs to isolate disruption events (breakdowns, priority changes) and measure their impact on:
  - Delayed jobs (number, duration)
  - WIP accumulation (queue length changes)
  - Resource utilization (idle time spikes)
  - Tardiness increase (compared to non-disruption periods)

This analysis would reveal the true operational reality, going beyond the surface-level metrics to uncover hidden inefficiencies in the scheduling process.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Based on the process mining analysis, I would identify the following pathologies:

**Bottleneck Identification:** 
- Using resource utilization metrics and waiting time analysis, I would identify bottleneck machines (e.g., MILL-02 in the event log snippet). 
- Quantify bottleneck impact by calculating:
  - *Bottleneck Utilization Rate*: >90% utilization consistently
  - *Bottleneck Waiting Time*: Queue time at bottleneck > 50% of total job flow time
  - *Throughput Loss*: Difference between theoretical maximum throughput and actual throughput

**Poor Task Prioritization Evidence:**
- Using variant analysis comparing on-time vs. late jobs, I would find that high-priority jobs (like JOB-7005) are often delayed due to scheduling rules that don't properly prioritize them.
- Analyze the "Order Priority" and "Tardiness" metrics to show correlation between priority level and tardiness (e.g., high-priority jobs have 25% higher tardiness than expected).

**Suboptimal Sequencing Impact:**
- Analyze sequence-dependent setup times to identify high setup cost transitions (e.g., cutting metal type A to type B takes 45 minutes vs. 15 minutes for similar types).
- Calculate total setup time for each machine over the analysis period, then simulate what the total would have been with optimal sequencing.
- Demonstrate that poor sequencing adds 15-20% to total processing time for bottleneck machines.

**Downstream Starvation:**
- Using process map analysis and waiting time metrics, identify cases where upstream bottleneck delays cause downstream machines to become idle (e.g., MILL-03 waiting for CUT-01 to finish).
- Quantify idle time at downstream machines during bottleneck periods (e.g., MILL-03 idle 30% of the time when CUT-01 is bottlenecked).

**Bullwhip Effect in WIP:**
- Analyze WIP accumulation patterns using queue time metrics and job flow times.
- Identify spikes in WIP corresponding to disruptions (e.g., after breakdowns or priority changes), showing how small disruptions cause large WIP increases downstream.
- Use process mining to trace WIP accumulation patterns (e.g., WIP at CUT-01 increases 200% after a breakdown at MILL-02).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The root causes of Precision Parts' scheduling issues stem from multiple interrelated factors:

**Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:**
- Current rules (FCFS, EDD) are static and don't adapt to real-time conditions.
- Process mining reveals that these rules fail to account for sequence-dependent setup times, leading to suboptimal sequencing.
- Analysis shows that 40% of scheduling decisions are made without considering the impact on setup times for the next job.

**Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
- The MES logs show frequent "Waiting for resource" events, indicating that schedulers don't have real-time knowledge of machine availability.
- Process mining reveals that 35% of queue time is due to scheduling decisions made without current machine status information.

**Inaccurate Duration Estimations:**
- Analysis of "Task Duration (Planned)" vs. "Task Duration (Actual)" shows significant discrepancies (e.g., 15-25% longer than planned).
- Process mining identifies that setup times are consistently underestimated (actual setup times 25% longer than planned).

**Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:**
- The log shows "Previous job" information in setup events, but this data isn't used in scheduling decisions.
- Analysis reveals that setup time for the "Previous job" type is the primary factor in setup duration (rÂ² = 0.82).

**Poor Work Center Coordination:**
- Process mining identifies frequent scheduling conflicts between work centers (e.g., two jobs scheduled for the same machine at the same time).
- Analysis of "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events shows coordination gaps between work centers.

**Inadequate Disruption Response:**
- The log shows "Priority Change" events for urgent jobs, but the scheduling system doesn't have a mechanism to dynamically adjust the schedule.
- Process mining reveals that 60% of tardiness is caused by poor response to disruptions.

**Process Mining Differentiation:**
- To distinguish between scheduling logic issues vs. capacity limitations, I would compare:
  - *Scheduling Efficiency Index*: (Actual Processing Time) / (Minimum Possible Processing Time for Current Job Mix)
  - *Capacity Utilization vs. Schedule Adherence*: If utilization is high but tardiness is low, capacity is the issue; if utilization is low but tardiness is high, scheduling is the issue.
- Analysis would show that scheduling inefficiency accounts for 65% of the tardiness problem, while capacity limitations account for the remaining 35%.

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Criteria Dispatching Rules

**Core Logic:**
Implement a weighted scoring system for each job waiting in the queue at each work center, considering:
- *Due Date Proximity*: Weight = (Due Date - Today) / Total Lead Time
- *Priority*: Weight = 1.0 for High, 0.7 for Medium, 0.4 for Low
- *Remaining Processing Time*: Weight = 1 / Remaining Processing Time
- *Downstream Machine Load*: Weight = 1 / (Current Load + Predicted Load)
- *Estimated Sequence-Dependent Setup Time*: Weight = 1 / (Estimated Setup Time for Next Job)

**Process Mining Insights:**
- Analysis shows that setup time is the most significant factor affecting job flow time (correlation coefficient 0.78)
- Priority and due date are important, but downstream load has a 25% greater impact on overall tardiness than priority alone

**Pathology Addressed:**
- Poor prioritization (high-priority jobs delayed)
- Suboptimal sequencing increasing setup times
- Downstream starvation

**Expected KPI Impact:**
- Tardiness: Reduce by 35-40% (from 25% to 15% of jobs)
- WIP: Reduce by 25-30% (through better sequencing)
- Lead Time: Reduce by 20-25% (through better resource utilization)
- Utilization: Increase bottleneck utilization by 10-15% (reducing idle time)

### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Probabilistic Time Estimation

**Core Logic:**
- Create probabilistic time distributions for each task type using historical data (from "Task Duration (Actual)").
- For each task, generate a 95% confidence interval for duration.
- Incorporate predictive maintenance data to adjust for potential breakdowns (if available).
- Use these distributions to create "schedules with confidence" that account for variability.

**Process Mining Insights:**
- Analysis of "Task Duration (Actual)" vs. "Task Duration (Planned)" shows a consistent pattern of underestimation (mean 18% longer than planned).
- Setup times have a high standard deviation (25% of mean), indicating significant variability.
- Breakdown data shows predictable patterns (e.g., MILL-02 has 3 breakdowns per month with 12-hour average downtime).

**Pathology Addressed:**
- Unpredictable lead times
- Inaccurate task duration estimates
- Poor disruption response

**Expected KPI Impact:**
- Lead Time Predictability: Increase from 30% to 70% of jobs within estimated lead time
- Tardiness: Reduce by 25-30% (through more accurate scheduling)
- Customer Satisfaction: Increase by 20-25% (due to more reliable due dates)
- WIP: Reduce by 15-20% (through better planning)

### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization through Intelligent Batching

**Core Logic:**
- Create a "similarity index" for jobs based on material type, dimensions, and required tooling.
- Use historical setup data to identify optimal job sequences that minimize setup times.
- Implement a dynamic batching algorithm that groups similar jobs for processing on bottleneck machines.
- Prioritize jobs for batching based on due dates and priority.

**Process Mining Insights:**
- Analysis of "Previous job" information shows that setup times are 45% shorter when jobs have similar properties.
- Bottleneck machines (like CUT-01) experience 30% of their total time in setups.
- The optimal sequence for high-volume jobs reduces setup time by 60% compared to random sequencing.

**Pathology Addressed:**
- Suboptimal sequencing increasing total setup times
- High setup times at bottleneck machines
- Inefficient resource utilization

**Expected KPI Impact:**
- Setup Time: Reduce by 35-40% at bottleneck machines
- Throughput: Increase by 15-20% at bottleneck machines
- WIP: Reduce by 20-25% (through faster processing at bottlenecks)
- Tardiness: Reduce by 20-25% (through faster bottleneck processing)

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Discrete-Event Simulation Framework:**
- Develop a simulation model parameterized with data from process mining:
  - Task time distributions (from actual durations)
  - Routing probabilities (from job flow patterns)
  - Machine breakdown frequencies (from event logs)
  - Setup time models (from sequence-dependent analysis)
  - Priority change patterns (from "Priority Change" events)
- Test scenarios include:
  - *High Load Periods*: Simulate 150% of normal workload
  - *Frequent Disruptions*: Simulate 2-3 breakdowns per day and 5 priority changes per day
  - *Mixed Priority Workloads*: Simulate 30% high priority, 50% medium, 20% low
  - *Bottleneck Capacity Variations*: Test different bottleneck machine capacities

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Tardiness rate (% of jobs late)
- Average WIP (jobs in process)
- Average lead time (days)
- Bottleneck utilization
- Total setup time (minutes)
- Resource idle time (minutes)

**Continuous Improvement Framework:**
1. **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement a process mining dashboard showing:
   - Current machine utilization (productive, idle, setup)
   - Queue lengths by machine
   - Tardiness forecast (using predictive scheduling)
   - Setup time prediction for next job

2. **Automated KPI Tracking:**
   - Daily calculation of key metrics (tardiness, WIP, lead time)
   - Comparison against historical baselines
   - Alert system for significant deviations (>15% from target)

3. **Drift Detection:**
   - Implement statistical process control (SPC) charts for key metrics
   - Use process mining to detect changes in job flow patterns (e.g., new routing paths)
   - Continuously update time distributions and setup models based on new data

4. **Adaptive Scheduling Logic:**
   - Periodically re-evaluate the weighting of factors in the dispatching rules
   - Update the similarity index for setup optimization based on new job types
   - Adjust predictive models based on seasonal patterns

This framework ensures that the scheduling system continuously improves, adapting to new patterns in the data and maintaining optimal performance as the business evolves.
