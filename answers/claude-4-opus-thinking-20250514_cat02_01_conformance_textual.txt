Based on my analysis of the normative process description and the event log, I've identified the following violations:

## Cases with Violations:

### **Case 2** - Violation: Package items before payment authorization
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** The normative description explicitly states that "Package items" should only occur after authorization. In this case, items are packaged at 10:00 before payment is authorized at 10:30. This violates the principle that payment authorization must precede packaging, as you wouldn't want to prepare items for shipment before confirming the customer can pay for them.

### **Case 3** - Multiple severe violations
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **Illogical flow with cancellation:** The process authorizes payment at 09:40 but then cancels the order at 10:00. This suggests either the inventory was insufficient (in which case payment should never have been authorized) or some other issue arose. According to the normative description, if inventory is insufficient, the process should go directly from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order" without authorizing payment.

2. **Shipping after cancellation:** The most severe violation occurs when the order is shipped at 10:30 after being canceled at 10:00. The normative description explicitly states that "Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation, and that it would be illogical to continue with fulfillment activities after canceling an order.

### **Case 5** - Violation: Missing packaging step
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** This case completely skips the "Package items" activity. The normative description clearly states that items must be packaged before they can be shipped. The expected sequence includes packaging as a mandatory step between payment authorization and shipping. Shipping items without proper packaging preparation violates the standard fulfillment process.

## Compliant Cases:

- **Case 1:** Follows the complete expected sequence for sufficient inventory scenarios
- **Case 4:** Follows the expected sequence for insufficient inventory scenarios (cancel after inventory check, then close)

These violations represent different types of process deviations, from incorrect activity ordering (Case 2), to logically inconsistent flows (Case 3), to missing mandatory activities (Case 5).
