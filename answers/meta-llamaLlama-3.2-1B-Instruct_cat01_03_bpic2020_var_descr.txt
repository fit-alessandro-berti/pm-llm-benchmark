What a fascinating dataset!

After analyzing the data, I've identified the process underlying this data as follows:

**Process:** "Request Payment" or "Request Payment and Approval"

**Sequence of Events:**

1. **Employee Submits a Request**: An employee submits a request for payment, which can be a new payment or a payment that needs to be finalized.
2. ** Approval by Administration**: The request is then passed to the administration, which approves or rejects it.
3. **Approval by Supervisor**: If the request is approved by administration, it is then reviewed by a supervisor, who finalizes the payment.
4. **Payment Handled**: Once the payment is final and approved, it is automatically handled by the system.

**Additional Processes:**

* **Declaraions**: There are also various declarations (e.g., SUBMITTED, APPROVED, FINAL APPROVED) that occur before the payment process begins. These declarations are likely related to the approval or finalization of the request, but I couldn't pinpoint their exact roles.
* **Request Payment**: The request for payment appears to be an automatic process that triggers the entire workflow. The system likely handles the payment processing and tracking.

**Relationships between Processes:**

* The approval by administration and the final approval by supervisor are closely related, as they both finalize the payment.
* The requirement for the adminstration approval and the supervisor approval may indicate a more complex approval process, but it seems to be a standard workflow.

Overall, this process appears to be an automation of a payment workflow, where various departments (administration, supervisor, and others) collaborate to ensure that the payment is processed and approved correctly.
