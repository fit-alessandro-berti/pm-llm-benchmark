To construct the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process, we need to identify and formulate the various constraints among the activities involved. Here's how we can model it based on the provided activities and their logical relations:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set([
        ('RO', 'IC')  # For every receive order, an invoice is sent to the customer
    ]),
    'always_before': set([
        ('RI', 'CA'),  # Reserve items can only occur if the availability has been checked
        ('PI', 'RI'),  # Pick items can only happen if the items have been reserved
        ('QC', 'PI'),  # Quality check happens after items are picked
        ('PO', 'QC'),  # Pack order happens only after the quality check
        ('GSL', 'PO'),  # Shipping label is generated after the order is packed
        ('D', 'GSL'),  # Dispatch happens only after the shipping label is generated
        ('IC', 'D'),   # Invoice to the customer happens after the dispatch
        ('RP', 'IC')   # Recording payment happens only after invoice is generated
    ]),
    'always_after': set([
        ('CA', 'RO'),  # Check availability should always follow receiving an order
        ('RI', 'RO'),  # Reserve items should always follow receiving an order
        ('PI', 'RO'),  # Picking items should always follow receiving an order
        ('QC', 'RO'),  # Quality check should always follow receiving an order
        ('PO', 'RO'),  # Packing the order should always follow receiving an order
        ('GSL', 'RO'),  # Generating shipping label should always follow receiving an order
        ('D', 'RO'),   # Dispatching should always follow receiving an order
        ('IC', 'RO'),  # Invoice to customer should always follow receiving an order
        ('RP', 'RO')   # Recording payment should always follow receiving an order
    ]),
    'never_together': set([
        ('RO', 'RP')  # Receive Order and Record Payment cannot occur simultaneously (assuming payment record is used to finalize the process)
    ]),
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},    # Each order must be received exactly once
        'CA': {0, 1}, # Availability check can happen 0 or 1 time
        'RI': {0, 1}, # Reserve items can happen 0 or 1 time
        'PI': {1},    # Pick items must happen exactly once
        'QC': {1},    # Quality check must happen exactly once
        'PO': {1},    # Packing order must happen exactly once
        'GSL': {1},   # Generating shipment label happens exactly once
        'D': {1},     # Dispatch happens exactly once
        'IC': {1},    # Invoice to customer happens exactly once
        'RP': {1}     # Recording payment happens exactly once
    },
    'directly_follows': set([
        ('CA', 'RO'), # Checking availability directly follows receiving an order
        ('RI', 'CA'), # Reserving items directly follows checking availability
        ('PI', 'RI'), # Picking items directly follows reserving items
        ('QC', 'PI'), # Quality check directly follows picking items
        ('PO', 'QC'), # Packing order directly follows quality check
        ('GSL', 'PO'), # Generating shipping label directly follows packing order
        ('D', 'GSL'), # Dispatching directly follows generating shipping label
        ('IC', 'D'),  # Invoicing customer directly follows dispatch
        ('RP', 'IC')  # Recording payment directly follows invoicing customer
    ])
}

print(log_skeleton)
```

This dictionary contains all the declarative constraints for the given order fulfillment process in a large-scale distribution center. Each activity and constraint is carefully placed based on the logical sequence and necessary dependencies between activities.
