To analyze and compare the two POWL models of the Hire-to-Retire process, we need to first understand the standard flow: 

1. Post_Job_Ad
2. Screen_Candidates
3. Conduct_Interviews
4. Make_Hiring_Decision
5. Onboard_Employee
6. Add_to_Payroll
7. Close_Case

### Analyzing POWL Model 1

The standard order defined in Model 1 is:
- Post_Job_Ad
- Screen_Candidates
- Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision in parallel
- If Make_Hiring_Decision is positive, then Onboard_Employee
- Add_to_Payroll
- Close_Case

Potential anomalies in Model 1:
1. The flow from Screen_Candidates directly to both Decide and Interview suggests that the interviews might happen before the decision on candidates is made, which is illogical.
2. There is no explicit mention of the Conduct_Interviews step following the Screen_Candidates phase, potentially leading to a gap in the process where candidates are not interviewed.
3. The addition of the Payroll step before closing the case is in line with a standard hiring process, however, the order of Decide and Onboard is presented without a clear interview phase.

### Analyzing POWL Model 2

The standard order defined in Model 2 is:
- Post_Job_Ad
- Screen_Candidates and Conduct_Interviews (this step seems out of sequence with the standard process)
- Conduct_Interviews leading to Make_Hiring_Decision
- Looping Onboard_Employee (with a silent transition option, implying optional re-looping)
- Payroll step is optional (XOR with skip transition)
- Close_Case

Potential anomalies in Model 2:
1. The Conduct_Interviews step is said to occur alongside the Screening, which is not standard practice; interviews should follow screening.
2. The Onboard_Employee activity is placed in a loop structure which allows for potential unnecessary looping unless there's a specific reason to iterate over onboarding (e.g., training phases), which is not typically part of standard hiring.
3. The XOR between Payroll and skip transition indicates that Payroll might be optional, which goes against typical hiring practices where adding a new employee to the payroll is mandatory.

### Comparison and Conclusion

**Model 1** closely aligns with the standard process despite anomalies:
- It captures the typical sequence of a recruitment process.
- The anomaly of deciding and interviewing in parallel can be considered a minor deviation.

**Model 2** introduces more significant deviations:
- It suggests conducting interviews before screening candidates, which is a fundamental error.
- It includes looping in the onboarding process without justifiable reasoning, which does not align with a normative hiring process.
- The Payroll step being optional is not in line with standard practices.

### Justification

**Model 1** is the better representation of a normative Hire-to-Retire process because:
- It follows the standard sequence of activities.
- The anomalies are less severe and more easily explained within the context of process variations (e.g., parallel decisions).
- The inclusion of an interview and decision phase before onboarding is closer to typical practice, even if the exact order presented could be improved.

Therefore, **Model 1** more closely aligns with the normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process.
