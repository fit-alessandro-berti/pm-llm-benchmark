The traces that **contain bias are in Group B (the “Unprotected Group”).**  
Bias emerges from the **hard-wired +5 adjustment rule**: *if the candidate’s ProfessionalAssociation field = “LocalBusinessLeadersClub,” add five points to the CulturalFit score.*

How the bias manifests
1. **Systematic advantage for one subgroup**  
   – U001 and U003 each receive an unconditional +5 adjustment, lifting their CulturalFit scores from 6065 and 5863, respectively.  
   – No candidate in Group A receives (or even qualifies for) a comparable boost.

2. **Higher hiring yield for the favored subgroup**  
   – Without the adjustment, U001 (CulturalFit=60) and U003 (58) would have received *exactly the same CulturalFit values* as not-hired Group-B candidate U002 (60) and Group-A candidate P002 (60).  
   – After adjustment both are elevated above that apparently critical threshold and are hired.

3. **Hidden proxy for demographic favoritism**  
   – “LocalBusinessLeadersClub” is ostensibly neutral, yet membership is far likelier among the statistically dominant culture (local residents/B).  
   – By explicitly privileging this affiliation, the algorithm re-encodes, in a single extra-field adjustment, the very disparity the “protected group” label seeks to remedy.
   
Implications for fairness and equity
- **Vertical disparate impact** – the policy raises the effective bar for everyone not in the club.  
- **Horizontal disparate treatment** – two candidates with identical raw attributes are scored differently based on non-job-related attributes.  
- **Audit and compliance risk** – the +5 rule, although deterministic, systematically disadvantages candidates from the protected group (who—per the event log—cannot belong to the club) and would fail standard four-fifths rule tests.

As currently implemented, the CulturalFit adjustment is therefore a direct form of algorithmic bias.
