1.  **Strategic Vulnerability:** Given the global reliance on specific component suppliers (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, etc.) tied together by a strict Parallel Join, what resilience strategies are in place to prevent a single geopolitical or logistical disruption from paralyzing the entire supply chain?
2.  **R&D Handoff:** What specific data metrics or design documentation must the R&D task provide to the Component Securing tasks to ensure that the procured parts meet the prototype's exact specifications and minimize the risk of assembly failures?
3.  **Assembly Efficiency:** Since the assembly process runs 24/7, how are operational risks, such as planned and unplanned maintenance or labor constraints in Malaysia, factored into the overall production schedule and buffer inventory calculations?
4.  **Trade-off Justification:** What specific set of criteria (e.g., product margin, inventory cost, desired time-to-market, or geographical distance) determines the critical split decision between utilizing high-cost Air Freight versus slower Cargo Ship transportation?
5.  **Quality Control Thresholds:** What quantifiable defect rate thresholds trigger the Exclusive Gateway decision to execute "Rework or Scrap" versus allowing products to pass "Quality Checks & Diagnostics," and who manages the variance in these thresholds over time?
6.  **Customs Contingency:** Since customs clearance can be unpredictable, what predefined procedures or financial buffers are allocated to mitigate extended delays or regulatory penalties that arise during the "Customs Clearance & Regulatory Compliance" task?
7.  **Synchronization Mechanism:** Describe the communication and coordination protocol utilized to ensure the simultaneous completion of the four geographically dispersed Component Securing tasks before the Parallel Join can execute.
8.  **Bottleneck Identification:** Which specific task within the entire process has been identified as the most frequent or costly bottleneck, and what continuous process improvement initiatives are focused solely on increasing its throughput?
9.  **Forecasting Accuracy:** How is the performance and accuracy of the initial "Conduct Market Research" task measured against the actual outcomes observed during the final "Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast" step?
10. **Decentralized Distribution:** What level of autonomy do the Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs) possess in dynamically allocating inventory between Retail, E-Commerce, and VIP/Pre-Order fulfillment paths based on local demand surges or unforeseen competitor actions?
11. **Feedback Loop Effectiveness:** What is the mechanism and expected time frame for translating data gathered during the "Fulfill E-Commerce Orders" task into actionable insights that inform the final Exclusive Gateway decision regarding supplier order adjustments?
12. **Scrap/Rework Analysis:** When a batch is directed to "Rework or Scrap," how is the root cause of the failure traced back (e.g., component fault, design flaw, or assembly error) and reported to the responsible upstream departments?
13. **Cost of Complexity:** How does the organization quantify the increased logistical complexity and potential communication overhead associated with globally sourcing components from four distinct regions versus attempting a regional supply consolidation strategy?
14. **Strategic Site Selection:** What were the primary strategic drivers (e.g., tax incentives, labor skill/cost, proximity to shipping lanes) that justified selecting Malaysia as the sole assembly plant location, and how is this decision periodically reviewed against potential geopolitical shifts?
15. **Inventory Buffer Strategy:** At which points in the supply chain (e.g., post-Sourcing Parallel Join, pre-Assembly, or at RDCs) does the organization strategically hold safety stock, and how are the buffer levels determined to balance cost versus service level targets?
16. **Stakeholder Notification:** In the event of a significant, high-impact delay in securing a critical component (e.g., microprocessors from Taiwan), what is the cascading communication plan to notify downstream internal stakeholders and potentially adjust promised fulfillment timelines?
17. **KPI Trigger:** What are the precise, quantifiable triggers (e.g., X units of excess inventory, Y% variance from the sales forecast) that necessitate the action "Adjust Orders to Suppliers" rather than "Proceed to Next Sales Cycle"?
18. **Packaging Optimization:** How is the "Pack & Label Smartphones" task optimized to meet the varying regulatory and safety requirements across the global distribution paths (Air Freight vs. Cargo Ship) without creating unnecessary packaging complexity or increasing material costs?
19. **Lead Time Measurement:** How is the cumulative lead time measured across the entire process—specifically from the initial R&D design approval (pre-sourcing) through to the "Receive at Regional Distribution Centers" task—to identify total time-to-market?
20. **Parallel Distribution Evaluation:** After the distribution is complete, how is the comparative performance (speed, cost, and order accuracy) of the four distinct fulfillment methods (Warehousing, Retail, E-Commerce, VIP) measured to inform resource allocation for the next sales cycle?
