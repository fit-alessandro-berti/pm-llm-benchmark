### Labeled Activities and Rationale:

#### 1. **Idle/Standby**  
   - **Events:** 1-3, 13-15  
   - **Sensor Pattern:**  
     - Low temperature (~20–21°C).  
     - Minimal pressure (1 bar).  
     - No vibration (0 Hz).  
     - No material flow (0 units/s).  
     - Tool position at 0 mm (neutral).  
     - Low energy consumption (~0.4–0.5 kWh).  
   - **Rationale:**  
     These events represent the machine in an inactive state, likely waiting for input or resetting. The lack of vibration, flow, and tool movement, combined with baseline energy usage, suggests no active manufacturing process.

#### 2. **Cutting Metal**  
   - **Events:** 4–6  
   - **Sensor Pattern:**  
     - Temperature spikes (50°C  58°C).  
     - Vibration increases sharply (30 Hz  38 Hz).  
     - Material flow begins (5 units/s).  
     - Tool position moves progressively (5 mm  10 mm).  
     - Energy consumption rises (2.0  3.0 kWh).  
   - **Rationale:**  
     The rapid temperature rise and high vibration suggest friction from cutting tools. Steady material flow and tool advancement align with feeding metal into a cutting mechanism. Energy usage reflects active mechanical work.

#### 3. **Assembling Parts**  
   - **Events:** 7–8  
   - **Sensor Pattern:**  
     - Moderate temperature (40°C).  
     - Pressure increases (2 bar).  
     - Reduced vibration (10 Hz).  
     - Lower material flow (2 units/s).  
     - Tool position stabilizes (15 mm).  
     - Energy remains moderate (2.0 kWh).  
   - **Rationale:**  
     Stable temperature and tool position with elevated pressure imply clamping or joining parts. Reduced vibration and material flow suggest precision alignment rather than aggressive cutting.

#### 4. **Welding**  
   - **Event:** 9  
   - **Sensor Pattern:**  
     - Extreme temperature (80°C).  
     - High vibration (50 Hz).  
     - Material flow stops (0 units/s).  
     - Tool position static (15 mm).  
     - Energy spikes (5.0 kWh).  
   - **Rationale:**  
     The temperature surge and energy spike are consistent with welding (e.g., arc welding generates heat). Vibration could stem from welding equipment, while halted material flow suggests the machine is fixed in place during welding.

#### 5. **Quality Inspection**  
   - **Events:** 10–12  
   - **Sensor Pattern:**  
     - Temperature drops (30°C  25°C).  
     - Low vibration (1–5 Hz).  
     - Minimal material flow (0–1 units/s).  
     - Tool retracts slightly (15 mm  20 mm).  
     - Energy decreases (1.0–1.6 kWh).  
   - **Rationale:**  
     Cooling temperature and low energy suggest post-processing. Minor tool adjustments and intermittent material flow could indicate visual or sensor-based inspection (e.g., checking weld quality).

### Process Flow Deduction:  
1. **Idle**  **Cutting** (Events 1–3  4–6): Machine activates for cutting as temperature/vibration rise.  
2. **Cutting**  **Assembling** (Events 6  7–8): Tool stabilizes, pressure increases to join parts.  
3. **Assembling**  **Welding** (Events 8  9): Sudden energy/temperature spike for welding.  
4. **Welding**  **Inspection** (Event 9  10–12): Machine cools, inspects output.  
5. **Inspection**  **Idle** (Events 12  13–15): Cycle completes, machine returns to standby.  

### Key Observations:  
- **Energy and Temperature** were critical for distinguishing high-intensity phases (cutting/welding) from lower-intensity ones (assembling/inspection).  
- **Tool Position and Material Flow** helped identify transitions (e.g., feeding material vs. holding still).  
- **Vibration** differentiated mechanical operations (cutting, welding) from precision tasks (assembling, inspection).  

This approach mirrors real-world process mining, where sensor data trends are mapped to domain-specific activities using contextual knowledge of manufacturing workflows.
