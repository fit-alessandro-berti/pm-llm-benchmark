The visualization is a **BPMN-style swimlane process diagram** showing how a **computer hardware shop dispatches (ships) goods**, split across three lanes:

- **Secretary (Computer hardware shop)** – main coordination steps  
- **Warehouse** – packaging and physical handling  
- **Logistics** – external logistics/insurance activity

### Flow summary
1. **Start: “Ship goods”** (in the Secretary lane), then a parallel split sends work toward both coordination and warehouse preparation.
2. **Secretary clarifies shipment method**, then a decision gateway asks **“Special handling?”**
   - **No:** proceed to **check if insurance is required** (using *customer information* and *order details*).
     - If insurance is needed, the flow goes to the **Logistics lane** to **insure parcel**, then rejoins.
     - Regardless, the secretary **writes the package label**.
   - **Yes:** the secretary **gets 3 offers from logistic companies** and **selects a logistic company and places the order**.
3. Meanwhile in the **Warehouse lane**, the warehouse **packages goods**. A timer boundary event indicates that after **48 hours**, the process can trigger **“Notify customer about delay.”**
4. The process synchronizes, then the secretary **fills out shipment paperwork**, the warehouse **moves the package to the pickup area**, and the process ends at **“Shipment prepared.”**

Overall, it depicts the end-to-end preparation of a shipment, including conditional insurance, optional special-handling carrier selection, and a delay notification path.
