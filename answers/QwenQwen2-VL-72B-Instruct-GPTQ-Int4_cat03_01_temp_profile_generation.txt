Sure, here is an example of a temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```
{'Receive Purchase Order': ('Prepare Purchase Order', 86400, 3600),
 'Prepare Purchase Order': ('Send Purchase Order', 3600, 3600),
 'Send Purchase Order': ('Receive Goods', 86400, 3600),
 'Receive Goods': ('Prepare Payment', 3600, 3600),
 'Prepare Payment': ('Send Payment', 3600, 3600),
 'Send Payment': ('Close Process', 86400, 3600)}
```

In this example, the process starts with receiving a Purchase Order and ends with closing the process after sending the payment. The average time between receiving a Purchase Order and preparing it is 1 day, while the standard deviation is 1 hour. The average time between preparing the Purchase Order and sending it is 1 hour, while the standard deviation is 1 hour. And so on for the rest of the process.
Note that this is just an example and the actual average and standard deviation values may vary depending on the specific process and organization.
