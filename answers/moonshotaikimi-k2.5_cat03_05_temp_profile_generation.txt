The user wants a Python dictionary representing a temporal profile for a supply chain process. 

Key requirements:
1. Activities involved: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS (10 activities)
2. The temporal profile should include pairs of activities that eventually follow each other (not just directly connected)
3. For each pair, provide (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds
4. Should include pairs separated by multiple steps (not just consecutive)
5. Don't provide explicit numerical temporal information in the explanation, but the LLM should estimate realistic times
6. Should be a representative subset (not necessarily all pairs, but enough to show complexity)

The process flow appears to be roughly:
SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS

But there could be variations, and we need to consider pairs that skip steps.

Let me think about realistic timeframes for a high-tech electronics supply chain:

- SS to OP: Supplier selection to order placement could be days to weeks (negotiation, selection process)
- OP to RC: Order placement to receiving components - this is supplier lead time, could be weeks to months for electronics components (e.g., 2-8 weeks)
- RC to QI: Receiving to inspection - usually quick, hours to days
- QI to CA: Inspection to assembly - could be immediate or days depending on queue
- CA to PT: Assembly to testing - could be hours to days
- PT to PK: Testing to packaging - hours to days
- PK to WS: Packaging to storage - hours
- WS to DT: Storage to distribution - could be days to weeks depending on orders
- DT to AS: Distribution to after-sales support - this happens after customer receives it, so weeks to months

Now for non-consecutive pairs:
- SS to RC: Selection to receiving - includes selection + lead time (weeks to months)
- SS to CA: Selection to assembly - even longer
- OP to CA: Order to assembly - lead time + inspection
- RC to PT: Receive to testing - includes inspection, assembly
- etc.

Standard deviations should reflect variability - supply chains have high variability for external steps (shipping, supplier delays), lower for internal steps.

Let me construct a representative subset with realistic estimates:

Time units in seconds:
- 1 hour = 3600
- 1 day = 86400
- 1 week = 604800
- 1 month  2592000 (30 days)

Pairs to include (representative subset):
Directly following:
- ('SS', 'OP'): maybe 3-7 days (selection process), std dev 2 days
- ('OP', 'RC'): 2-4 weeks (lead time), std dev 1 week (supplier variability)
- ('RC', 'QI'): 1 day, std dev 0.5 days
- ('QI', 'CA'): 0.5 days, std dev 0.25 days
- ('CA', 'PT'): 2 days, std dev 1 day
- ('PT', 'PK'): 1 day, std dev 0.5 days
- ('PK', 'WS'): 4 hours, std dev 2 hours
- ('WS', 'DT'): 3-5 days, std dev 2 days (waiting for shipment batch)
- ('DT', 'AS'): 30 days (warranty period starts), std dev 15 days

Skipped steps (showing complexity):
- ('SS', 'RC'): selection + lead time = ~1 month, std dev 1.5 weeks
- ('OP', 'QI'): lead time + receiving = ~2-4 weeks + 1 day
- ('RC', 'CA'): inspection + queue = ~1-2 days
- ('QI', 'PT'): inspection + assembly = ~2-3 days
- ('CA', 'PK'): assembly + testing + packaging = ~3-4 days
- ('SS', 'CA'): selection to assembly = ~1 month + few days
- ('OP', 'PT'): order to testing = lead time + inspection + assembly
- ('RC', 'PK'): receive to packaging = inspection + assembly + testing
- ('QI', 'DT'): inspection to distribution = assembly + testing + packaging + storage + shipping
- ('SS', 'AS'): whole process = months

Let me calculate specific numbers (in seconds):

Direct:
- ('SS', 'OP'): (432000, 172800) - 5 days avg, 2 days std
- ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 604800) - 2 weeks avg, 1 week std
- ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200) - 1 day, 0.5 day std
- ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 21600) - 0.5 day, 0.25 day std
- ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 86400) - 2 days, 1 day std
- ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 43200) - 1 day, 0.5 day std
- ('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 7200) - 4 hours, 2 hours std
- ('WS', 'DT'): (345600, 172800) - 4 days, 2 days std
- ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 1296000) - 30 days, 15 days std

Skipped (complexity):
- ('SS', 'RC'): (1641600, 691200) - ~19 days (5d + 14d), std dev 8 days
- ('OP', 'CA'): (1296000, 648000) - 15 days (14d + 1d), std dev 7.5 days
- ('RC', 'PT'): (345600, 172800) - 4 days (1d + 0.5d + 2d), std dev 2 days
- ('CA', 'DT'): (604800, 259200) - 7 days (2d + 1d + 0.5d + 4d), std dev 3 days
- ('SS', 'PT'): (1814400, 777600) - ~21 days, std dev 9 days
- ('QI', 'WS'): (345600, 144000) - 4 days (0.5+2+1+0.33), std dev 1.6 days
- ('OP', 'PK'): (1468800, 720000) - 17 days, std dev ~8 days
- ('RC', 'DT'): (777600, 345600) - 9 days, std dev 4 days

I should provide a good mix that demonstrates the concept well. Let me select about 15-20 pairs that show various distances in the process.

Final selection:
1. ('SS', 'OP') - initial step
2. ('OP', 'RC') - external lead time
3. ('RC', 'QI') - quick internal
4. ('QI', 'CA') - quick internal
5. ('CA', 'PT') - manufacturing
6. ('PT', 'PK') - post-testing
7. ('PK', 'WS') - warehousing
8. ('WS', 'DT') - outbound logistics
9. ('DT', 'AS') - post-delivery
10. ('SS', 'RC') - selection to receiving (skips OP)
11. ('OP', 'QI') - order to inspection (skips RC)
12. ('RC', 'CA') - receiving to assembly (skips QI)
13. ('CA', 'PK') - assembly to packaging (skips PT)
14. ('QI', 'DT') - inspection to distribution (skips several)
15. ('SS', 'CA') - selection to assembly (long skip)
16. ('OP', 'PT') - order to testing (long skip)
17. ('RC', 'DT') - receiving to distribution (major portion)

This gives a good representative subset showing both consecutive and non-consecutive pairs with realistic supply chain timing.

Now I'll format this as a Python dictionary as requested.
