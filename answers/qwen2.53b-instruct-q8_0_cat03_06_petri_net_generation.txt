Below is a Python code snippet that constructs an accepting Petri net for your insurance claim management scenario. This includes places, transitions, arcs, and markings to represent each step of the process.

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Define the Petri Net with places for states between activities
net = PetriNet("InsuranceClaimProcess")

# Start and End Places
start = PetriNet.Place(name="Start")
end = PetriNet.Place(name="End")
claim_registrated = PetriNet.Place(name="Claim Registered")
doc_verification = PetriNet.Place(name="Document Verification")
fraud_check = PetriNet.Place(name="Fraud Check")
claim_assessment = PetriNet.Place(name="Claim Assessment")
approval = PetriNet.Place(name="Approval")
payment = PetriNet.Place(name="Payment")
notification = PetriNet.Place(name="Notification")
closure = PetriNet.Place(name="Closure")

# Transitions for Activities
cr = PetriNet.Transition(name="Claim Registration", label="CR")
dv = PetriNet.Transition(name="Document Verification", label="DV")
fc = PetriNet.Transition(name="Fraud Check", label="FC")
ca = PetriNet.Transition(name="Claim Assessment", label="CA")
ap = PetriNet.Transition(name="Approval", label="AP")
p = PetriNet.Transition(name="Payment", label="P")
n = PetriNet.Transition(name="Notification", label="N")
cl = PetriNet.Transition(name="Closure", label="CL")

# Arrows between places
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start, claim_registrated, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_registrated, doc_verification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(doc_verification, fraud_check, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, claim_assessment, net)

# Add arcs for possible loops in Document Verification and Fraud Check
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(doc_verification, start, net)  # Re-Document Submission (RDS) loop
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, doc_verification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, fc, net)

# Add arcs for Claim Assessment and Approval loops
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_assessment, start, net)  # In-Depth Investigation (II) loop
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_assessment, approval, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval, payment, net)

# Add arcs for Payment and Notification loops
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment, notification, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification, closure, net)

# Initial Marking (im) with a token at the Start place
im = Marking()
im[start] = 1

# Final Marking (fm) when all places have tokens except for End and Notification
# Assume that notification has a token before reaching Closure
fm = Marking()
for place in net.places:
    if place != end and place != notification:
        fm[place] = 1

print("Net: ", net)
print("Initial marking (im):", im)
print("Final marking (fm):", fm)

# Function to check the state of the Petri Net at a given point
def is_claim_closed(net, mark):
    return all(value > 0 for value in mark.values())

# Example: Check if a claim with only start and end marked has reached closure.
assert is_claim_closed(net, im | Marking(end=start) | fm)
```

In this code:

- We've defined the Petri net structure based on your described flow of activities. Each transition is associated with an activity name for clarity.
- Initial marking (`im`) places a token at the `Start` place, indicating that a new claim has arrived.
- Final marking (`fm`) shows how tokens should be distributed when all activities have taken their course except `End` and `Notification`.
  
The final check function `is_claim_closed(net, mark)` is provided to verify whether the Petri net reaches its final state. This simple assertion can be used to validate if a claim has reached closure according to your specified process.
