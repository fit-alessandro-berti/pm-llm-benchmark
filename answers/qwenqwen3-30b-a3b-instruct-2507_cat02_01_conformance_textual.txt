We are tasked with identifying which cases in the event log deviate from the **normative process** described. Let’s analyze each case in light of the rules and constraints outlined in the normative description.

---

###  **Key Rules from the Normative Description:**

1. **Sequence must begin with "Receive order"** – all cases satisfy this.
2. **"Check inventory" must occur before any decision about payment or fulfillment**.
3. **If inventory is sufficient**  correct flow:  
   `Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`
4. **If inventory is insufficient**  correct flow:  
   `Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`
5. **Critical constraints:**
   - `Authorize payment`  only after `Check inventory`, and **before** `Package items`.
   - `Package items`  only after `Authorize payment`, and **before** `Ship order`.
   - `Ship order`  only after `Package items`, **and never after cancellation**.
   - `Close order`  must be the **last** activity in all cases.
   - **After cancellation**, no further fulfillment activities (e.g., package, ship) should occur.

---

Now, let’s evaluate each case:

---

###  **Case 1:**
| Activity | Order |
|--------|-------|
| Receive order |  |
| Check inventory |  |
| Authorize payment |  (after check) |
| Package items |  (after authorization) |
| Ship order |  (after packaging) |
| Close order |  (last) |

** Valid.** Follows the full successful path.

---

###  **Case 2:**
| Activity | Order |
|--------|-------|
| Receive order |  |
| Check inventory |  |
| Package items |  **Before authorization** |
| Authorize payment |  (after package) |
| Ship order |  (after package) |
| Close order |  |

**Violation:**  
- `Package items` occurs **before** `Authorize payment`.  
- This violates the rule: *"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.*

Even though the order eventually gets authorized and shipped, **packaging before payment authorization** is illogical and a violation.  
- Payment authorization should confirm the customer’s ability to pay **before** committing to packaging and shipping.
- The process assumes that payment must be approved before incurring the cost of packaging.

** Violation: Packaging before authorization.**

---

###  **Case 3:**
| Activity | Order |
|--------|-------|
| Receive order |  |
| Check inventory |  |
| Authorize payment |  (before cancellation) |
| Cancel order |  (after check) |
| Ship order |  **After cancellation** |
| Close order |  |

**Violation:**  
- After `Cancel order`, the process proceeds to `Ship order`.  
- The normative description explicitly states: *"Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)."*

Even though payment was authorized before cancellation (which is questionable), the **real issue** is that **shipping occurs after cancellation**.

- Cancellation implies the order is no longer to be fulfilled.
- Shipping after cancellation is nonsensical and contradicts the process logic.

** Violation: Shipping after cancellation.**

Additionally, **authorizing payment before cancellation** may be questionable, but the bigger issue is the **shipping after cancellation**.

>  Note: While payment authorization *before* cancellation is not strictly forbidden by the description, the description implies that **payment authorization should only happen when the order is viable**. However, the **primary and definitive violation** is shipping after cancellation.

---

###  **Case 4:**
| Activity | Order |
|--------|-------|
| Receive order |  |
| Check inventory |  |
| Cancel order |  (after check) |
| Close order |  (last) |

** Valid.** This is the correct path for insufficient inventory.

No fulfillment activities occur after cancellation. All good.

---

###  **Case 5:**
| Activity | Order |
|--------|-------|
| Receive order |  |
| Check inventory |  |
| Authorize payment |  (after check) |
| Ship order |  **Before packaging** |
| Close order |  (last) |

**Violation:**  
- `Ship order` occurs **before** `Package items`.  
- The normative description states: *"Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'."*

This is a clear violation. You cannot ship items before they are packaged.

Even though payment was authorized and inventory checked, **shipping without packaging** is illogical and improper.

** Violation: Shipping before packaging.**

---

###  Summary of Violations:

| Case ID | Violation(s) | Reason |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **1** | None | Correct sequence |
| **2** | **Packaging before payment authorization** | Violates: "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" |
| **3** | **Shipping after cancellation** | Violates: "Ship order" should never occur after cancellation |
| **4** | None | Correct cancellation path |
| **5** | **Shipping before packaging** | Violates: "Ship order" only after "Package items" |

---

###  Final Answer:

#### **Cases that violate the normative process:**
- **Case 2**
- **Case 3**
- **Case 5**

#### **Explanations of Violations:**

- **Case 2**: The "Package items" activity occurs **before** "Authorize payment". This violates the rule that payment must be authorized before packaging, as packaging incurs costs and should not proceed without confirmed payment.

- **Case 3**: The order is canceled, yet "Ship order" is performed afterward. This is illogical and explicitly prohibited: once canceled, fulfillment activities (like shipping) should not occur.

- **Case 5**: "Ship order" occurs **before** "Package items", which contradicts the requirement that items must be packaged before shipment. Shipping unboxed items is not acceptable under the normative process.

---

###  Conclusion:
Cases **2, 3, and 5** deviate from the intended process flow. The violations involve **incorrect sequencing of key fulfillment activities**, specifically:
- Packaging before authorization,
- Shipping after cancellation,
- Shipping before packaging.

These deviations undermine the integrity, logic, and risk management of the order process.
