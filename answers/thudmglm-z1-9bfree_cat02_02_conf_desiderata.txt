### **Analysis of Cases**  
#### **Part 1: Normative Rule Violations**  
1. **Case 2**:  
   - **Violations**:  
     - **Ordering Rule Violation**: Risk Assessment (08:20) occurs **before** Credit Check (09:00), violating the normative constraint that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.  
     - **Finalization After Rejection**: Finalize Documentation (10:00) is performed **after** Loan Decision (09:30) for a rejected loan, violating the rule that documentation must not be finalized if the loan is rejected.  
   - **Reasons**: Likely due to miscommunication between teams (e.g., a junior officer prioritizing risk assessment first) or procedural oversight.  

2. **Case 3**: Sequence is compliant, but timing issues are **desiderata violations**, not normative ones.  

3. **Case 1**: Fully complies with normative rules.  

#### **Part 2: Desiderata Violations**  
1. **Case 3**:  
   - **Credit Check Timeliness**: Completed on 14th (4 days **after** application on 12th). The recommendation is 24 hours.  
   - **Applicant**: Informed on 16th (4 days **after** approval on 14th). The recommendation is 48 hours.  
   - **Lack of Follow-up Call**: No action recorded, violating the recommendation to call before closing.  
   - **Reasons**: Possible bottlenecks in processing (e.g., delayed credit checks due to resource shortages) or procedural negligence.  

2. **Case 2**:  
   - **Desiderata Violation** ( severe): Finalization after rejection is a **normative violation**, not a desiderata issue.  

3. **Case 1**: Fully satisfies timing recommendations (credit check within 30 minutes, applicant informed 4 hours after decision).

### **Interpretations/Justifications**  
1. **Case 2 Violations**:  
   - **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check**: A junior officer might have misunderstood the order due to unclear training.  
   - **Finalization After Rejection**: A clerical error during documentation (e.g., copying code from an approved case template).  

2. **Case 3 Desiderata Breaches**:  
   - ** Delayed Credit Check**: System overload or manual processing delays.  
   - ** Late Applicant notion**: Overstretched staff prioritizing volume over speed.  
   - **No Follow-up Call**: Manual follow-up processes were skipped due to resource constraints.  

3. **General Improvement Areas**:  
   - **Use Templates/Automatic Workflows**: To prevent procedural errors (e.g., Case 2’s logic mistake).  
   - **Automate Timers**: Send warnings when deadlines (1-day credit check, 2-day applicant notification) are missed (as in Case 3).  
   - **Small-Scale Training**: Clarify the normative-dGestureRecognizer boundary (e.g., “Finalization *must* not occur post-rejection,” but “follow-up calls are encouraged”).

### **Conclusion**  
- **Case 2** must be corrected through stricter adherence to normative rules.  
- **Case 3** should aim to meet desiderata (e.g., faster credit checks) to avoid reputational harm.  
- **Case 1** is an exemplar of compliance and recommends-iness.
