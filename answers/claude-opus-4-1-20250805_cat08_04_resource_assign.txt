# Process Mining-Based Resource Assignment Optimization for TechSolve Solutions

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### Individual Agent and Tier Performance Analysis

Using the event log data, I would extract and analyze the following key metrics to understand resource behavior:

**Agent-Level Metrics:**
- **Average Handling Time (AHT)** per ticket category and priority level
- **Daily/Weekly Ticket Volume** handled per agent
- **Resolution Rate** - percentage of tickets resolved without escalation
- **Rework Rate** - frequency of tickets returning to the same agent
- **Skill Utilization Rate** - percentage of time spent on tickets matching documented skills

**Tier-Level Metrics:**
- **First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1**: Calculate as (L1 Resolved Tickets / Total L1 Handled) × 100
- **Average Queue Time** between assignment and work start per tier
- **Escalation Rate** from each tier (L1L2, L2L3)
- **Processing Time Distribution** by ticket category and priority

### Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Discovery

**Resource Interaction Analysis:**
I would construct a resource handover matrix showing frequency and patterns of ticket transfers between agents. This reveals:
- Frequent handover pairs indicating potential skill dependencies
- Isolated agents who rarely interact (potential knowledge silos)
- Circular handovers suggesting assignment confusion

**Social Network Analysis:**
Create directed graphs where:
- Nodes represent agents
- Edges represent ticket handovers
- Edge weights indicate handover frequency

This identifies:
- Central agents who act as knowledge hubs
- Assignment clusters within tiers
- Unexpected cross-tier interactions

**Role Discovery Algorithms:**
Apply organizational mining techniques to discover:
- *De facto* roles versus formal tier assignments
- Agents consistently handling specific ticket types despite tier placement
- Hidden specializations not captured in documented skills

### Skill Utilization Analysis

**Skill-Match Score Calculation:**
For each ticket assignment, calculate:
```
Skill_Match_Score = (Agent Skills  Required Skills) / Required Skills
```

**Specialist Utilization Matrix:**
Create a heat map showing:
- Rows: Agents with specialized skills
- Columns: Ticket complexity levels
- Values: Percentage of time spent

This reveals if L3 specialists are handling routine L1-appropriate tasks.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### Specific Problem Identification

**Skill Availability Bottlenecks:**
- Analyze wait times for tickets requiring specific skills (e.g., "Networking-Firewall")
- Calculate: Average_Wait_Time[skill] = Mean(Assignment_Time - Creation_Time) for tickets requiring that skill
- Identify skills with wait times exceeding SLA thresholds

**Reassignment Impact Analysis:**
- Extract reassignment chains from the event log
- Calculate metrics:
  - Average reassignments per ticket = Total Reassignments / Total Tickets
  - Delay per reassignment = Mean(Next_Assignment_Time - Previous_Work_End_Time)
  - Cascading delay effect = Cumulative delay for tickets with multiple reassignments

**Initial Assignment Accuracy:**
- Track "First Touch Resolution Rate" = Tickets resolved by first assigned agent / Total tickets
- Identify patterns in tickets requiring reassignment:
  - Mismatched skills (assigned agent lacks required skill)
  - Incorrect tier assignment (L1 assigned to complex issues)
  - Category misclassification leading to wrong specialist assignment

**Workload Distribution Analysis:**
- Calculate coefficient of variation for ticket volumes across agents within same tier
- Identify agents with consistently >120% average workload (overloaded)
- Identify agents with <80% average workload (underutilized)

### Quantified Impact Assessment

**SLA Breach Correlation:**
- Perform regression analysis linking SLA breaches to:
  - Number of reassignments (expect positive correlation)
  - Initial skill match score (expect negative correlation)
  - Agent workload at assignment time (expect positive correlation)

**Example Quantification:**
- Each reassignment adds average 45 minutes to resolution time
- 68% of P2 SLA breaches involve at least one skill mismatch
- L1 agents escalate 62% of tickets they could potentially resolve (based on similar ticket analysis)

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### Current Assignment Rule Deficiencies

**Round-Robin Limitations:**
The current round-robin approach ignores:
- Agent skill sets versus ticket requirements
- Current agent workload and queue depth
- Historical agent performance on similar tickets
- Time-of-day availability patterns

### Skill Profile Accuracy Issues

**Variant Analysis Approach:**
Compare two cohorts:
- Cohort A: Tickets resolved without reassignment
- Cohort B: Tickets with 2+ reassignments

Analysis reveals:
- Cohort B shows 73% have initial skill mismatch
- Agent skill profiles haven't been updated in 6+ months
- New technologies (e.g., cloud platforms) not reflected in skill taxonomy

### Ticket Categorization Problems

**Decision Mining Application:**
Apply decision tree learning to understand categorization logic:
- Input features: Ticket description keywords, reported channel, user department
- Target variable: Actual required skill (determined post-resolution)

Findings might include:
- 31% of "Software-App" tickets actually require "Database-SQL" skills
- Keywords like "slow," "error," "cannot access" poorly differentiate categories

### L1 Empowerment Gaps

**Escalation Pattern Analysis:**
- Track escalation reasons in free-text notes
- Identify frequently escalated issues that L1 successfully resolves in other cases
- Calculate "Preventable Escalation Rate" = Similar tickets resolved by L1 / Total escalated tickets of that type

Root causes discovered:
- Lack of knowledge base articles for common issues
- Insufficient L1 training on diagnostic tools
- Risk-averse culture encouraging unnecessary escalations

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Multi-Factor Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

**Issue Addressed:** Skill mismatches causing reassignments and delays

**Implementation Design:**
```
Assignment_Score =  × Skill_Match +  × Proficiency_Level +  × Historical_Performance +  × Current_Workload

Where:
- Skill_Match = (Agent_Skills  Required_Skills) / Required_Skills
- Proficiency_Level = Weighted skill proficiency (1-5 scale)
- Historical_Performance = Success rate on similar tickets
- Current_Workload = 1 / (1 + Current_Queue_Size)
- , , ,  = Optimized weights from historical data
```

**Data Requirements:**
- Comprehensive skill inventory with proficiency levels
- Historical resolution data by agent and ticket type
- Real-time queue status

**Expected Benefits:**
- 40% reduction in skill-based reassignments
- 25% improvement in average resolution time
- 15% increase in first-touch resolution rate

### Strategy 2: Predictive Complexity-Based Tier Assignment

**Issue Addressed:** Incorrect initial tier assignments causing cascading delays

**Implementation Design:**
- Train a machine learning classifier (e.g., Random Forest) to predict appropriate tier based on:
  - Ticket description (TF-IDF vectorization)
  - Category and subcategory
  - User history (frequent complex issues?)
  - Time patterns (end-of-month reports often need L2)
  
- Model outputs: {L1_Capable, L2_Required, L3_Required} with confidence scores

**Data Requirements:**
- Historical tickets with final resolution tier
- Ticket description text
- User profile and history data

**Expected Benefits:**
- 50% reduction in unnecessary escalations
- 30% improvement in L1 utilization
- 20% reduction in average ticket lifecycle

### Strategy 3: Dynamic Workload-Aware Agent Pooling

**Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution and rigid tier boundaries

**Implementation Design:**
- Create flexible agent pools based on real-time demand:
  - **Core Pool:** Agents stay in assigned tier
  - **Flex Pool:** Agents can float between adjacent tiers based on demand
  - **Specialist Pool:** High-skill agents reserved for complex issues

- Algorithm:
```python
if L1_Queue_Time > Threshold and L2_Queue_Time < Threshold:
    Move top-performing L2 agents to assist L1
elif Critical_Skill_Queue > SLA_Risk_Threshold:
    Prioritize specialist allocation to critical tickets
```

**Data Requirements:**
- Real-time queue metrics per tier and skill
- Agent performance scores and skill versatility index
- SLA countdown timers

**Expected Benefits:**
- 35% reduction in queue time variance
- 25% improvement in specialist utilization
- 30% reduction in P2/P3 SLA breaches

### Strategy 4: Intelligent Escalation Gating

**Issue Addressed:** Premature escalations from L1

**Implementation Design:**
- Implement escalation decision support:
  - Before escalating, system suggests similar resolved L1 tickets
  - Provides confidence score for L1 resolution possibility
  - Requires escalation justification if confidence > 70%

- Knowledge base integration with dynamic updates based on successful L1 resolutions

**Data Requirements:**
- Comprehensive ticket similarity metrics
- L1 resolution history with detailed solution steps
- Escalation reason categorization

**Expected Benefits:**
- 40% reduction in L1L2 escalations
- Increased L1 agent confidence and skill development
- 20% reduction in L2/L3 workload
