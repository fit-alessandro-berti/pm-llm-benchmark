# Case Identification Analysis

After analyzing the event sequence, I can identify three distinct patient cases based on consistent patient attributes (age, gender) and logical process flows.

## Case 1: 45-year-old Male with Leg Injury
**Patient Profile:** 45-year-old male, private insurance, ER department

**Events in sequence:**
1. Event #1: Register patient (08:05:13)
4. Event #4: Initial triage (08:10:50) - Triage code 3
7. Event #7: X-ray imaging (08:15:42) - Left leg
12. Event #12: Doctor consultation (08:23:10) - Diagnosed with hairline fracture
15. Event #15: Patient discharged (08:30:05) - Follow-up at outpatient clinic

**Process flow:** This patient entered through ER, received triage, had an X-ray of the left leg, was diagnosed with a hairline fracture, and was discharged with outpatient follow-up.

## Case 2: 62-year-old Female with Infection
**Patient Profile:** 62-year-old female, public insurance, ER department

**Events in sequence:**
2. Event #2: Register patient (08:07:02)
5. Event #5: Initial triage (08:12:29) - Triage code 2 (higher priority)
8. Event #8: Lab test requested (08:16:10) - Blood panel
10. Event #10: Lab test completed (08:20:27) - Normal levels
11. Event #11: Doctor consultation (08:22:54) - Diagnosed with minor infection
14. Event #14: Prescription created (08:27:00) - Antibiotics
17. Event #17: Patient discharged (08:35:29) - Follow-up at pharmacy

**Process flow:** This patient entered through ER with a higher triage priority, had blood tests that showed normal levels, was diagnosed with a minor infection, received an antibiotic prescription, and was discharged with instructions to pick up medication.

## Case 3: 28-year-old Male for Knee Surgery
**Patient Profile:** 28-year-old male, private insurance, Surgery department

**Events in sequence:**
3. Event #3: Register patient (08:07:15) - Surgery department
6. Event #6: Doctor consultation (08:13:00) - Scheduled knee surgery
9. Event #9: Surgery preparation (08:16:45) - General anesthesia
13. Event #13: Surgery performed (08:25:19) - Arthroscopy procedure
16. Event #16: Recovery room (08:31:37) - Stable condition
18. Event #18: Patient discharged (08:40:13) - Follow-up physiotherapy

**Process flow:** This patient came in for a scheduled knee surgery, consulted with the surgeon, underwent preparation for general anesthesia, had arthroscopic surgery performed, recovered in the recovery room, and was discharged with physiotherapy follow-up.

## Inference Method
I identified these cases by:
1. Grouping events with matching patient demographics (age and gender)
2. Verifying logical process sequences (registration → triage → treatment → discharge)
3. Confirming timeline consistency (all events within each case follow chronological order)
4. Checking departmental consistency and handoffs (e.g., ER to Radiology and back)
5. Validating that diagnosis and treatment information align within each case

Each case shows a complete patient journey from registration to discharge with appropriate intermediate steps for their specific medical condition.
