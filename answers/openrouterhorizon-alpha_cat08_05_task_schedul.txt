Section 1. Analyze historical scheduling performance and dynamics with process mining

1.1 Event log preparation and reconstruction
- Build a unified event schema. Keys: Case ID (Job), Operation ID (Job, Task), Activity (Queue Entry, Setup Start/End, Task Start/End, Breakdown Start/End, Priority Change), Resource (Machine), Operator, Timestamps, Due Date, Priority, Planned vs Actual durations, Product/route. Ensure each task has a unique operation identifier (Job-OpSeq).
- Derive lifecycle intervals:
  - Queue time per task: Queue Entry  Setup Start or Task Start if no setup.
  - Setup time: Setup Start  Setup End.
  - Processing time: Task Start  Task End.
  - Blocked/waiting due to breakdown: Intersections between task intervals and resource unavailability windows.
- Derive job-level metrics:
  - Release time: first Job Released.
  - Completion time: last Task End.
  - Lead time/flow time: completion  release.
  - Tardiness: max(0, completion  due date). Lateness: completion  due date.
  - Makespan (periodic): span between first start and last finish within a horizon.
- Reconstruct resource timelines:
  - For each machine, order events to build a Gantt stream: Busy (Setup, Run), Idle (no job), Down (breakdown), Changeover (setup), Blocked (operator unavailable).
  - Sequence of jobs processed to analyze sequence-dependent setup.

1.2 Process mining techniques and metrics
- Discovery:
  - Directly-Follows Graph (DFG) per job type/product family to extract dominant routings and rework loops.
  - Heuristic miner/Inductive Miner on operation-level traces to handle noise, producing a process map with frequencies and performance annotations (median times on edges/nodes).
  - Variant analysis to compare routings of on-time vs late jobs.
- Performance overlays:
  - Lead time and makespan distributions by product family and priority.
  - Per-operation queue time distributions; percentile heatmaps per machine.
  - Resource utilization: busy% (run), setup%, idle%, down% from resource timelines; OEE-like KPIs (availability, performance vs planned).
- Sequence-dependent setup analysis:
  - Construct sequence matrix S[ij, m] for machine m: aggregate setup durations when job family/type i is followed by j; compute mean/percentiles and confidence. Visualize as heatmap to identify costly transitions. Include context (tooling state, operator, shift) via regression to adjust for confounders.
  - Learn predictive setup model: features = previous job attributes (family, material, thickness, tooling), next job attributes, time-of-day, operator; model = gradient boosting. Output expected setup with uncertainty for any candidate sequence.
- Schedule adherence and tardiness:
  - Tardiness distribution and % late by segment (product, priority).
  - Due-date conformance trend over time; calendar heatmaps by day/shift.
  - At-task level: planned vs actual distributions; systematic bias by operation/operator.
- Disruption impact:
  - Causal impact windows: for each breakdown and hot-job insertion, measure deltas in queue length, tardiness, and utilization before/after vs matched control periods.
  - Downtime propagation: compute additional waiting or rescheduling per job affected by a breakdown (overlap analysis).
  - Sensitivity: correlation between breakdown frequency on bottlenecks and tardiness.

Section 2. Diagnose scheduling pathologies using mining outputs

- Bottlenecks:
  - Identify machines with highest utilization of run+setup, longest average/95th queue times, and highest WIP accumulation upstream. Compute cycle time elasticity: change in system throughput per marginal capacity at that machine (via queueing approximation or simulation).
  - Evidence: persistent long queues at, e.g., MILL-03; increased lateness strongly associated with queuing before this machine.
- Poor prioritization:
  - Compare queue position dynamics of high-priority or near-due jobs vs others. If high-priority jobs frequently wait behind low-priority ones, or are expedited late creating chaos, that’s symptomatic.
  - KPI: fraction of hot jobs that still miss due date; lateness delta after priority change events.
- Suboptimal sequencing raising setup time:
  - Use S[ij] to show frequent high-cost transitions occurring more than necessary, especially on bottlenecks. Compare actual sequences to heuristic minimum-changeover sequence cost; compute avoidable setup percentage.
- Starvation and blocking:
  - Cross-correlation of output of upstream machines with idle periods of downstream resources; identify starvation episodes following upstream breakdowns or overly long runs upstream.
- WIP bullwhip:
  - WIP time series by work center; high variability and amplification downstream indicate poorly synchronized release/scheduling.
- Operator/resource contention:
  - Periods where operator availability gates machine production; quantify waits for operators at setup start.

Techniques used: bottleneck analysis by performance-DfG overlays, variant analysis (on-time vs late), resource contention mining (resource handover graphs), queue dynamics visualization, what-if re-sequencing using S[ij] to estimate potential setup reduction.

Section 3. Root cause analysis

- Static rules in dynamic environment:
  - FCFS/EDD ignore sequence-dependent setups, downstream congestion, and stochastic durations. Evidence: frequent high-cost transitions, high queue times at bottlenecks despite capacity.
- Lack of real-time visibility:
  - Jobs dispatched to already congested centers; mined data shows dispatch decisions not responsive to actual queue length or breakdowns.
- Inaccurate estimates:
  - Systematic positive bias of actual vs planned times for certain operations/operators; high variance not reflected in safety times  unreliable due-date promises.
- Ineffective setup handling:
  - No tooling family batching; frequent ij pairs with high setup cost when low-cost clusters existed.
- Poor cross-center coordination:
  - Upstream releases cause surge WIP at bottlenecks; no CONWIP/WIP caps; starvation/overproduction cycles visible in WIP charts.
- Disruption response:
  - Hot jobs preempting without holistic impact assessment; breakdown recovery lacks rescheduling; measurable tardiness spikes post-events.

Differentiating scheduling vs capacity/variability:
- Counterfactual analysis: simulate with current capacity/variability but optimal sequencing to estimate schedulable improvement. If large gap remains, root cause is scheduling. If not, capacity is binding.
- Regression of tardiness on queue times at bottlenecks, controlling for operation times; large coefficients suggest capacity. Presence of avoidable setup cost and mis-prioritization effects point to scheduling logic.
- Variance decomposition: proportion of lead time variance explained by waiting vs processing; waiting share implicates scheduling/coordination.

Section 4. Advanced data-driven scheduling strategies

Strategy 1: Dynamic composite dispatching with setup-aware, due-date risk, and congestion terms
- Core logic:
  - For each machine when free, select next job j in queue minimizing a dynamic priority score:
    Score(j) = w1 * SlackRisk(j) + w2 * SetupCost(prevj) + w3 * DownstreamCongestion(j) + w4 * ProcTime(j)/RemainingRoute + w5 * PriorityBoost(j) + w6 * OperatorReady(j) + w7 * DueDateClassPenalty if late-risk high.
  - SlackRisk(j): predicted lateness probability using a model trained on mined distributions and current WIP; includes remaining processing times with uncertainty.
  - SetupCost(prevj): predicted sequence-dependent setup from the learned model S; favors low-changeover sequences without ignoring urgent jobs.
  - DownstreamCongestion(j): estimated queueing delay on next bottleneck from current WIP snapshot; penalize pushing jobs that will wait downstream.
  - OperatorReady(j): penalize if required operator not available soon.
- Use mined data:
  - Processing time predictions conditional on operator, shift, product.
  - Real-time WIP/queue lengths from MES; setup predictions from S; lateness risk model from historical features.
  - Weights w1..w7 tuned via simulation-based optimization or contextual bandits.
- Addresses:
  - Reduces tardiness by explicit risk term, reduces setups via sequence-aware term, balances flow by congestion term, reduces starvation by operator readiness.
- Expected impact:
  - Tardiness: 20–40%; WIP: 10–25%; Lead time variance: 20–30%; Bottleneck utilization improves by replacing setup-heavy transitions with smarter sequences without starving urgent jobs.

Strategy 2: Predictive scheduling with rolling horizon and stochastic times
- Core logic:
  - Every  minutes, run a rolling-horizon schedule on a finite horizon (e.g., next 24–48 hours) using a stochastic program or sample-average approximation:
    - Inputs: predicted task durations (by operation, operator, product), setup times (sequence-dependent), breakdown risk calendars (predictive maintenance or survival models), operator rosters.
    - Objective: minimize expected weighted tardiness + setup costs + WIP holding, with penalties for violating WIP caps at bottlenecks.
    - Constraints: machine/ operator capacity, precedence, preemption rules for hot jobs, WIP caps, time windows for maintenance.
  - Generate a baseline sequence for each machine, publish only near-term dispatch list (next k tasks) to remain robust; reoptimize on disruptions.
- Predictive components:
  - Duration models: gradient boosting/GLM by features (material, thickness, tolerance, operator, shift, machine), producing predictive distributions.
  - Breakdown models: time-to-failure using Weibull/Cox per machine, feeding availability probabilities and scheduling preventive maintenance at low-cost windows.
  - Due date risk: Monte Carlo to estimate probability of miss; used in objective weights.
- Addresses:
  - Proactive identification of bottlenecks and rescheduling before crises; more realistic promises to customers using predictive completion distributions.
- Expected impact:
  - Tardiness: 30–50% under variability; On-time delivery reliability increases; Better maintenance coordination reduces surprise downtime; Utilization at bottlenecks increases with fewer mid-run disruptions.

Strategy 3: Setup time optimization via intelligent batching and sequence planning on bottlenecks
- Core logic:
  - Identify setup-critical machines (from Section 2). For each, run a daily/shift-level sequence optimizer:
    - Build jobs pool for horizon H with release times and due dates.
    - Sequence to minimize total setup time + lateness penalties: minimize  Setup(prevnext) +   Tardiness.
    - Constraints: release times, max batch dwell times (avoid aging WIP), WIP caps, priority service for hot jobs with limited postponement.
  - Define similarity clusters (tooling families) from S[ij] or learned embeddings; allow micro-batching within clusters with due-date guards (e.g., lateness risk threshold).
  - Coordinate upstream release control (CONWIP): release jobs to bottleneck only when capacity window is forecast; hold upstream processing if it would create waiting inventory.
- Use mined data:
  - Sequence cost matrix from historical setups; cluster structures; due date risk from predictive model; historical dwell time sensitivity to quality.
- Addresses:
  - Large reductions in sequence-dependent setups at bottlenecks; smooths flow; reduces WIP by gating releases.
- Expected impact:
  - Setup time at targeted machines: 25–50%; Throughput up; WIP before bottleneck: 20–40%; Tardiness reduced especially for non-urgent jobs; care needed to protect urgent jobs via constraints.

Complementary enablers
- Operator cross-training recommendations from resource analysis to reduce operator-induced waits.
- Due date quoting model using predictive completion distributions to set feasible dates and penalties.

Section 5. Simulation, evaluation, and continuous improvement

5.1 Discrete-event simulation (DES) for strategy testing
- Build a DES calibrated by mining:
  - Routing logic per product variant; branching probabilities for rework.
  - Task time distributions per operation/machine/operator/shift; include setup time models dependent on sequence.
  - Downtime: breakdown interarrival/repair distributions or time-varying hazard; preventive maintenance windows.
  - Priority changes and hot job arrivals process.
  - Operator calendars and constraints.
- Implement control policies:
  - Baseline (current FCFS/EDD), Strategy 1 composite dispatch, Strategy 2 rolling-horizon stochastic schedule (emulating reoptimization), Strategy 3 setup-optimized sequences with CONWIP gates, and hybrids.
- Scenarios to test:
  - Load levels: 80%, 95%, 110% capacity.
  - Disruption regimes: normal, high breakdown rate, clustered breakdowns.
  - Mix changes: more hot jobs; product mix shift to high-setup families.
  - Data noise: duration variance increase; estimation bias.
  - Operator shortages or staggered shifts.
- KPIs:
  - On-time delivery %, average/95th tardiness, average/95th lead time, WIP levels and variability, resource utilization profile (run/setup/idle/down), total setup time at bottlenecks, number of preemptions, queue length distributions, stability metrics (schedule changes).
- Optimization/tuning:
  - Use simulation-based optimization (e.g., Bayesian optimization) to tune weights in Strategy 1, batching thresholds in Strategy 3, horizon/penalties in Strategy 2. Evaluate robustness across scenarios.

5.2 Continuous monitoring and adaptation via process mining
- Live dashboards:
  - Real-time WIP and queues per machine; tardiness risk heatmap for in-process jobs; bottleneck monitor; setup transition tracker versus plan.
  - OEE-like breakdown including setup share; alerts when setup share > target.
- KPI tracking and alerts:
  - Statistical process control on key KPIs (tardiness, lead time, setup share). Drift detection (CUSUM/ADWIN) on task duration distributions and setup matrix S.
  - Automatic retraining schedule for predictive models; trigger when prediction error exceeds threshold.
- Feedback and learning:
  - Closed-loop learning: log each dispatch decision and outcome; apply contextual bandits or reinforcement learning to adapt weights in composite rule, bounded by safety constraints.
  - Post-mortems for late jobs: mine path variants and bottleneck exposures; feed rules/refinements.
- Governance:
  - A/B or phased rollout at selected cells; safety guardrails (due-date overrides, maximum wait for priorities).
  - Change management with operators; explainable priorities to ensure adoption.

Expected transformation
- Near-term: deploy Strategy 1 on non-critical centers and Strategy 3 on key bottlenecks; quick wins via reduced setups and better prioritization.
- Medium-term: introduce rolling-horizon predictive scheduler, integrated with maintenance planning and due date quoting.
- Long-term: adaptive, learning-based dispatch tuned continuously by mined data, with robust performance under disruptions, lower WIP, predictable lead times, and markedly improved on-time delivery.
