After analyzing the constraints and activities in the DECLARE declarative process model, I'll try to describe the underlying process. Here's a high-level overview:

**Initial Step**

* The process starts with the activity "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" (constraint: Initialization).

**Parallel Execution**

* In parallel, the employee can submit the declaration, and the request for payment can be initiated (constraint: Co-Existence: ('Request Payment', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')).
* As the result of the co-existence constraint, the system should allow both activities to be executed simultaneously.

**Decision Point**

* After the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" is submitted, the employee has made a decision. The next activity depends on this decision.

**Two Independent Paths**

* If the decision is to **approve** the declaration, the process proceeds differently than if it's **rejected**.
* If approved, the declaration will go through the final approval step (constraint: Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')).

**Approval Process**

* After the final approval (constraint: Precedence: ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')),
	+ A payment request can be initiated (constraint: Succession: ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')).
	+ Alternatively, a payment can already have been initiated, and they will co-exist (constraint: Co-Existence: ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')).

**Synchronization Point**

* When the payment is handled (constraint: Succession: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')),
	+ The process can terminate.

**Path after Reject**

* If the declaration is **rejected**, the process diverges.

* **Re-submission**: The employee can re-submit the declaration (constraint: Response: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')).
	+ This leads to a certification process.
		- If approved, final approval can be reached.
		- If rejected, another option can be available, or the process can terminate.
* **Alternative sequence**: One of two paths in the model would be taken, which in this case cannot be interpreted alone as the path once the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" is submitted forks to two which end in the same place with the cycle analysis that follows.

**Cycle Detection**

* Example, if a
