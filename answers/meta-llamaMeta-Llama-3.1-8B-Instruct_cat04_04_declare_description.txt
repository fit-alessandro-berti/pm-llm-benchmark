Based on the provided constraints, I'll attempt to describe the process underlying this data.

The process appears to be a workflow for handling a declaration, which involves several steps:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: The process starts with the submission of a declaration by an employee. This is specified as the initialization constraint.
2. **Request Payment**: If the declaration is submitted, a request for payment is triggered. This is an existence constraint, indicating that the activity must be executed at least once.
3. **Payment Handled**: The request for payment is handled, and this activity is also an existence constraint.
4. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: There are two possible paths from this point:
	* If the payment is handled, the declaration is then approved by a supervisor, which is a succession constraint.
	* Alternatively, if the request payment is repeated (alternate response constraint), the payment is handled again, and the declaration is then approved by a supervisor.
5. **Succession and Alternating Paths**: The declaration is then approved by a supervisor, which is a succession constraint. The process can alternate between these two paths, with the payment being handled again and the declaration being approved by a supervisor.
6. **Chain Succession**: The chain succession constraint indicates that if the declaration is approved by a supervisor, then the request payment activity must occur, followed by the payment being handled.

Key observations:

* The process involves a feedback loop, where the payment is handled again and the declaration is approved by a supervisor.
* The use of alternate response and alternate succession constraints indicates that the process can alternate between different paths.
* The chain succession constraint suggests a sequential dependency between the declaration being approved by a supervisor and the request payment activity.

Please note that this description is based on the provided constraints and might not be the only possible interpretation of the process.
