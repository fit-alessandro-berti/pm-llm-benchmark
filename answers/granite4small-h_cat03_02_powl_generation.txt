Here's the Python code that constructs the corresponding POWL model for the complex digital service provisioning process based on the given scenario:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Create transitions
SR_verified = Transition(label="Service Request Verified")
CS_done = Transition(label="Contract Setup Done")

DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
D_R = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")

CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")

QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Create operator nodes
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])
choice_deploy = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Create strict partial order
powl_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    SR_verified, CS_done,
    DA, ACI,
    loop_config, choice_deploy,
    QA, SA, GLA
])

# Add edges to the partial order
powl_model.order.add_edge(SR_verified, CS_done)
powl_model.order.add_edge(CS_done, DA)
powl_model.order.add_edge(CS_done, ACI)

powl_model.order.add_edge(DA, loop_config)
powl_model.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_config)

powl_model.order.add_edge(loop_config, choice_deploy)

powl_model.order.add_edge(choice_deploy, QA)
powl_model.order.add_edge(choice_deploy, SA)

powl_model.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
powl_model.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)
```

Explanation:

1. We start by creating transitions for each activity in the process using `Transition` objects with appropriate labels.

2. For the looped configuration phase (Base Network Configuration followed by optional Debug & Reconfigure), we create an `OperatorPOWL` object with the `Operator.LOOP` operator and provide `[BNC, D_R]` as its children.

3. For the exclusive choice between Containerized Deployment and Monolithic Deployment, we create another `OperatorPOWL` object with the `Operator.XOR` operator and provide `[CD, MD]` as its children.

4. We then create a `StrictPartialOrder` object called `powl_model` to represent the overall process structure. It contains all the transitions and operator nodes created earlier in its `nodes` attribute.

5. Using the `order` property of `powl_model`, we add edges between the transitions to establish the partial order relationships as described in the scenario:
   - The Service Request Verified transition (`SR_verified`) must be completed before Contract Setup Done (`CS_done`).
   - Both Datacenter Allocation (`DA`) and Access Control Initialization (`ACI`) can start after Contract Setup Done.
   - Datacenter Allocation (`DA`) and Access Control Initialization (`ACI`) both lead to the looped configuration phase (`loop_config`).
   - The looped configuration phase (`loop_config`) leads to the exclusive choice between deployments (`choice_deploy`).
   - Both Quality Assurance (`QA`) and Security Audit (`SA`) can start after the deployment is completed.
   - Go-Live Approval (`GLA`) can only start after both Quality Assurance (`QA`) and Security Audit (`SA`) are completed.

This code faithfully represents the described scenario as a POWL model using the provided classes from `pm4py.objects.powl.obj` and `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj`. It includes transitions, silent transitions (if needed), partial orders for concurrent tasks, and operator nodes for loops and exclusive choices.
