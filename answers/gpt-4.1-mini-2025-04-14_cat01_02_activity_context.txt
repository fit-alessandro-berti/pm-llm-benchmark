Here is a detailed analysis followed by the revised event log with renamed activities and justifications for each renamed activity.

---

### Step 1 & 2: Identify repeated activities and contextual differences

**1. "Verify Documents"**  
- First occurrence in each case: Initial identity verification step right after request initiation.  
- Second occurrence (if present): Verification again after additional customer input or adjustments are made (e.g., after additional docs submitted or account adjustment done).  
**Renamed as:**  
- Initial verification  "Initial Document Verification"  
- Re-verification  "Re-Verification of Documents"

---

**2. "Call Customer"**  
- First or sole occurrence after verification problems or discrepancies: Call to request missing documents or clarify info.  
- Second or follow-up calls: To confirm received documents, confirm adjustments, or to have customer return (in branch case).  
**Renamed as:**  
- First call to request clarifications/missing info  "Outbound Call: Request Missing Info"  
- Follow-up or confirmation call  "Outbound Call: Confirm Info/Adjustments"  
- In branch context, where the call is to have customer come back  "Branch Call: Customer Return Request"

---

**3. "Submit Additional"**  
- Occurs only once and clearly indicates customer uploads additional documents.  
- Rename to be more explicit and consistent with naming style:  
**Renamed as:** "Customer Submission: Additional Documents"

---

**4. "Adjust Account"**  
- Happens only in some cases, representing internal corrections after calls/clarifications.  
- Rename to make clear that this is an internal correction step triggered by prior interactions.  
**Renamed as:** "Internal Account Adjustment"

---

**5. "Approve Request"**  
- Final approval step, consistent meaning; no rename needed.

### Step 4: Justifications

- **Initial Document Verification vs. Re-Verification of Documents**: The first verification occurs immediately after request initiation, representing the first check of documents. The later verification occurs after new information has been added or adjustments made, thus serving as a confirmation step.

- **Outbound Call: Request Missing Info vs Outbound Call: Confirm Info/Adjustments vs Branch Call: Customer Return Request**: Calls vary by purpose — initial calls to prompt customers for missing information, and follow-up calls to confirm successful updates. The branch call is distinct as it’s used to request a physical return to the branch, different from remote clarifications.

- **Customer Submission: Additional Documents**: Clearly describes the activity where customers upload new documents to resolve verification gaps, making it more explicit than the original "Submit Additional."

- **Internal Account Adjustment**: Marks internal workflow steps where agents correct or update account details based on new information or customer interactions, clarifying this is internal and corrective action.

- **"Approve Request"** is kept unchanged as its meaning is clear and unambiguous.
