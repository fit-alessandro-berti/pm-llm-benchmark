 Certainly! Below is an example of a DECLARE model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. This process typically involves activities such as placing an order, receiving goods, paying for the goods, and possibly handling invoices. The DECLARE model encodes constraints that might apply to such a process.

Please note that the support is set to 1.0 for all constraints, and the confidence values are hypothetical and should be adjusted based on the actual process data.

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Place Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Issue Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Pay Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'absence': {
        'Cancel Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.95}  # Assuming 5% of orders are canceled
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        'Finalize Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}  # Payment should be finalized exactly once
    },
    'init': {
        'Place Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}  # The process always starts with placing an order
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Place Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.98},  # 98% of orders are followed by receiving goods
        ('Receive Goods', 'Issue Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.99}  # 99% of goods received lead to an invoice
    },
    'coexistence': {
        ('Place Order', 'Issue Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.97},  # 97% of orders are associated with an inv
