To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, we need to analyze the process variants and their frequencies and performances. Here are the main differences based on the provided data and domain knowledge:

### Main Differences:

1. **Initial Registration Location:**
   - **Protected Group:** The protected group frequently registers at both the Emergency Room (ER) and the Diagnostic Facility (FD). They have multiple variants starting with registration at ER or FD.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The unprotected group predominantly registers at the FD, and specifically, they often start with an Expert Examination at the FD.

2. **Expert Examination:**
   - **Protected Group:** Expert examinations are performed, but they are less frequent compared to the unprotected group. The protected group has fewer instances of starting with an expert examination.
   - **Unprotected Group:** A significant number of process variants start with an Expert Examination, either at the FD or ER. This suggests that the unprotected group is more likely to undergo an expert examination initially.

3. **Thorough Examination:**
   - **Protected Group:** Thorough examinations are part of the process variants but are less frequent.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Thorough examinations are much more common, especially when combined with expert examinations. This indicates that the unprotected group undergoes more comprehensive initial assessments.

4. **Treatment Unsuccessful Pathways:**
   - **Protected Group:** There are a few instances where treatment is unsuccessful, leading to a repeated diagnostic and treatment cycle.
   - **Unprotected Group:** There are significantly more instances of unsuccessful treatments, leading to repeated diagnostic and treatment cycles. This suggests that the unprotected group may face more complications or delays in treatment success.

5. **Discharge Process:**
   - **Protected Group:** The discharge process is straightforward and follows a typical diagnostic and treatment pathway.
   - **Unprotected Group:** There are more complex pathways leading to discharge, with multiple unsuccessful treatments and repeated diagnostics. This indicates potential delays or complications in the treatment process for the unprotected group.

### Key Insights:

- **Initial Assessment:** The unprotected group undergoes more comprehensive initial assessments (Expert and Thorough Examinations) compared to the protected group.
- **Treatment Success:** The protected group has a more straightforward path to successful treatment and discharge, whereas the unprotected group experiences more complications and unsuccessful treatments.
- **Process Complexity:** The process variants for the unprotected group are more complex, involving more steps and potential delays.

### Conclusion:

The unprotected group appears to face more complex and lengthy processes, with more frequent complications and unsuccessful treatments. This suggests potential disparities in the quality and efficiency of care between the two groups. Addressing these differences could involve reviewing the initial assessment criteria, ensuring timely and effective treatments, and streamlining the discharge process for the unprotected group.
