Based on the provided process variants and their execution times, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. **Initial Registration Location:**
   - Protected Group: Most processes start with "Register at ER" or "Register at FD" (Frequency: 284 + 269).
   - Unprotected Group: All processes start with "Register at ER" or "Register at FD" and include an "Expert Examination" or "Thorough Examination" (Frequency: 1466 + 1418).

2. **Expert/Thorough Examination:**
   - Protected Group: Only a small portion of processes include "Expert Examination" or "Thorough Examination" (Frequency: 179 + 174 + 130 + 112).
   - Unprotected Group: A significant majority of processes include "Expert Examination" or "Thorough Examination" (Frequency: 1466 + 1418 + 656 + 604 + 592).

3. **Diagnosis and Treatment:**
   - Protected Group: Many processes skip the "Diagnosis" step or have a "Treatment unsuccessful" step before reaching a "Treatment successful" (Frequency: 88 + 83 + 80 + 78 + 67 + 61 + 54 + 51 + 50 + 48 + 46 + 43 + 41 + 40 + 40 + 37 + 31 + 30 + 29 + 25 + 25 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 19).
   - Unprotected Group: Most processes have a direct path from "Diagnosis" to "Treatment successful" (Frequency: 653 + 656 + 604 + 592 + 279 + 262 + 192 + 190 + 102 + 100 + 97 + 88 + 82).

4. **Discharge:**
   - Protected Group: Many processes have a "Discharge" step (Frequency: 284 + 269 + 179 + 174 + 130 + 112 + 88 + 80 + 78 + 73 + 67 + 61 + 54 + 51 + 50 + 48 + 46 + 43 + 41 + 40 + 40 + 37 + 31 + 30 + 29 + 25 + 25 + 24 + 22 + 20 + 19).
   - Unprotected Group: All processes include a "Discharge" step (Frequency: 1466 + 1418 + 656 + 653 + 604 + 592 + 505 + 279 + 262 + 225 + 192 + 190 + 102 + 100 + 97 + 88 + 82 + 40 + 35 + 32 + 30 + 29 + 16 + 15 + 13 + 9).

5. **Treatment Unsuccessful:**
   - Protected Group: A notable number of processes have a "Treatment unsuccessful" step (Frequency: 48 + 40 + 40 + 31 + 30 + 22 + 20 + 19).
   - Unprotected Group: A smaller portion of processes have a "Treatment unsuccessful" step (Frequency: 225 + 190 + 102 + 100 + 97 + 88 + 40 + 35 + 32 + 30 + 29 + 16 + 15 + 13 + 9).

These differences suggest that the unprotected group undergoes more thorough examinations and has a more direct path to successful treatment compared to the protected group, who experiences more unsuccessful treatments and has more variations in their process. This could indicate potential unfair differences in the treatment process.
