**Explanation of the Constraints Chosen:**

1.  **`existence`**: All defined activities are expected to occur at least once in a completed process instance leading to a launch.
2.  **`absence`**: No activities are specified that should *never* occur.
3.  **`exactly_one`**: The start (`IG`), the main decision point (`AG`), and the end (`FL`) are typically expected to occur exactly once per product launch process. `DD` is also likely, but given the potential for design revisions, a slightly lower confidence might be appropriate in a real-world scenario.
4.  **`init`**: The process must begin with 'Idea Generation'.
5.  **`responded_existence`**: If one of the parallel activities (TFC/CE or LT/UT) occurs, the other typically must also occur in the same case. Also, if an early step occurs, the final launch is expected to occur if the process is successful.
6.  **`coexistence`**: Activities that happen in parallel branches (TFC/CE and LT/UT) are expected to appear together within the same process instance.
7.  **`response`**: If an activity occurs, the subsequent steps in the flow must eventually occur (e.g., if 'Idea Generation' happens, 'Design Draft' must happen later). Confidence is slightly lower (0.9) for steps followed by parallel paths, indicating that either path is a valid response. Higher confidence (1.0 or 0.95) is used for sequential or synchronizing steps.
8.  **`precedence`**: An activity must occur before the activities that follow it in the process flow. This is a strong causal link.
9.  **`succession`**: A stricter relationship than `response` + `precedence`, implying a necessary progression through key stages (IG -> DD -> PC -> AG -> MP -> FL). Confidence is slightly less than 1.0 for transitions that might involve parallel paths (DD->PC, PC->AG).
10. **Alternative and Chained Constraints**: These are generally omitted or set to empty as the scenario implies a somewhat flexible, multi-path process rather than a rigid sequence where activities must be immediately adjacent or only one specific activity can follow/precede another.
11. **Negative Constraints**: No explicitly forbidden co-occurrences or sequences are mentioned in the scenario.
