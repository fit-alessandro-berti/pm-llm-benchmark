```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (10, 5),       # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: Average 10 days with 5-day variation due to supplier readiness and contract negotiations.
    ('OP', 'RC'): (3, 2),        # Order Placement to Receive Components: Average 3 days with 2-day variation for typical logistics lead times.
    ('RC', 'QI'): (1, 0.5),       # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: Average 1 day with 0.5-day variation due to inspection setup times.
    ('QI', 'CA'): (2, 1),         # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: Average 2 days allowing for inspection outcomes and assembly adjustments, standard deviation of 1 day.
    ('CA', 'PT'): (4, 2),         # Component Assembly to Product Testing: Average 4 days for comprehensive testing, variation due to product complexity.
    ('PT', 'PK'): (1, 0.5),       # Product Testing to Packaging: Average 1 day for packaging setup post-testing, variation for minor adjustments.
    ('PK', 'WS'): (2, 1),         # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: Average 2 days for warehouse intake and organization, variation due to product volume.
    ('WS', 'DT'): (3, 2),         # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: Average 3 days for scheduling and execution of shipments, variation depending on transport efficiency.
    ('DT', 'AS'): (10, 5),        # Distribution to After-Sales Support: Longer lead time due to potential customer interactions, variations based on support agreements.

This temporal profile dictionary captures the average times and standard deviations for a representative subset of activity pairs in a complex global supply chain process. It accounts for varying factors influencing transition delays between stages such as supplier negotiations, logistical lead times, inspection thoroughness, product complexity affecting testing, warehouse organization efficiency, transportation scheduling, and post-distribution support interactions. Note that these values are estimated for illustrative purposes and should be refined with actual data from event logs or domain expert insights in a real-world scenario.
