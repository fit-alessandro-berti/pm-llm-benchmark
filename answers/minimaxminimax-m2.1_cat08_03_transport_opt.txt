# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: A Comprehensive Optimization Approach

## Executive Overview

Speedy Parcels faces a common but critical challenge in last-mile logistics: balancing delivery punctuality against escalating operational costs. The detailed event data collected over six months—from GPS trackers, driver handheld scanners, dispatch systems, and maintenance logs—provides a rich foundation for process mining analysis. This report outlines a systematic approach to transform this disparate data into actionable insights, moving beyond surface-level observations to identify root causes of inefficiency and recommend data-driven optimizations. The methodology presented here leverages established process mining techniques while adapting them specifically to the unique characteristics of transportation and logistics operations.

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### 1.1 Data Preprocessing and Integration Challenges

The foundation of any successful process mining initiative lies in the quality and structure of the integrated event log. For Speedy Parcels, the data integration task presents several significant challenges that require careful handling to ensure analytical validity.

**Event Log Construction from Multiple Sources**

The primary challenge involves reconciling four distinct data streams that operate on different temporal granularities and reference frames. GPS trackers generate high-frequency position updates—typically every 10 to 30 seconds—producing a continuous stream of vehicle movement data. Driver handheld scanners record discrete delivery events at much lower frequency, typically one to four events per stop. The dispatch system provides planned route information as static snapshots, while maintenance logs capture discrete incident events. The integration strategy must establish a common temporal and spatial reference that allows meaningful correlation across these sources.

The case identifier structure requires careful definition. While the hypothetical log suggests using "Vehicle ID-Date" as the case ID, this approach may be insufficient for comprehensive analysis. A more nuanced case identification scheme would recognize that a single vehicle-day contains multiple concurrent process instances: the overall route execution, individual package delivery sub-processes, and vehicle health maintenance processes. The recommended approach creates multiple perspectives within a unified data model, allowing analysts to switch between process views (route-level, package-level, vehicle-level) while maintaining referential integrity.

**Temporal Alignment and Timestamp Synchronization**

Timestamp synchronization presents subtle but significant challenges. Different systems may operate on different clocks, leading to drift between data sources. GPS systems typically rely on satellite timing, while scanner systems may sync to dispatch server time. Before integration, timestamp alignment must be verified by correlating known simultaneous events—for example, comparing the timestamp of a "Depart Depot" event from the scanner system with the first GPS coordinate reading indicating departure from depot location.

**Handling Data Quality Issues**

Real-world GPS and scanner data inevitably contains quality issues that must be addressed during preprocessing. GPS coordinates may exhibit temporary inaccuracies due to signal multipath in urban canyons or signal loss in tunnels. The preprocessing phase should implement spatial smoothing algorithms and validate coordinate plausibility against known road networks. Scanner events may be missing or recorded out of sequence if drivers skip scans or record events retrospectively. Missing "Depart Customer" events, for instance, can be imputed by identifying the next "Arrive Customer" event or by analyzing GPS movement data indicating vehicle departure from a location.

**Spatial Data Enrichment**

Raw GPS coordinates provide limited analytical value without contextual enrichment. The preprocessing pipeline should enrich each GPS reading with street segment identification, address matching, proximity to customer locations, and traffic zone classification. This enrichment enables subsequent analysis linking delays to specific geographic areas and correlating service times with customer location characteristics.

### 1.2 Process Discovery Methodology

Process discovery aims to construct a process model that accurately represents the behavior observed in the event log. For last-mile delivery operations, the discovery process must capture both the planned sequence of activities and the numerous variations that occur in practice.

**Perspective Selection and Granularity Definition**

Effective process discovery requires clear definition of the process perspective under analysis. For Speedy Parcels, three primary perspectives warrant investigation. The route execution perspective traces the overall journey from depot departure through all delivery stops to return, capturing travel patterns, stops, and deviations. The delivery transaction perspective focuses on individual package handling, from pickup at depot through delivery confirmation or failed attempt. The vehicle operations perspective encompasses vehicle status changes, maintenance events, and driver shift patterns.

The granularity of activities must balance detail with model comprehensibility. Too fine-grained a definition—such as treating each GPS position update as a separate activity—produces incomprehensible models. Too coarse-grained a definition—such as simply recording "route executed"—loses valuable diagnostic information. The recommended activity classification scheme distinguishes between travel segments (movement between significant locations), service activities (customer interactions), operational activities (breaks, refueling, unscheduled stops), and administrative activities (scanning, documentation).

**Algorithm Selection for Logistics Process Discovery**

Different process discovery algorithms offer varying strengths for logistics analysis. The Inductive Miner produces process models that guarantee replayability on the event log and tend to produce block-structured models that are easy to interpret. For Speedy Parcels' delivery processes, which often exhibit relatively linear sequences with occasional deviations, the Inductive Miner provides an appropriate balance between accuracy and interpretability.

The Heuristic Miner offers an alternative approach that incorporates frequency information directly into the model construction, suppressing infrequent paths that may represent noise rather than systematic behavior. Given the variability inherent in urban delivery operations—including traffic delays, customer availability variations, and unexpected events—the Heuristic Miner may produce more robust models by filtering out one-off anomalies while preserving common variation patterns.

For this analysis, a multi-algorithm approach is recommended: initial discovery using the Inductive Miner to establish the basic process structure, followed by Heuristic Miner analysis to identify frequent deviation patterns and their frequencies.

**Incorporating Spatial and Temporal Aspects**

Traditional process mining focuses on control flow—the sequence of activities—while treating time and resources as separate analysis dimensions. For logistics applications, spatial and temporal aspects are so integral to the process that they warrant integration into the discovered model itself.

The discovery process should explicitly identify and characterize different stop types based on their spatial and temporal signatures. A "Delivery Stop" exhibits a characteristic pattern: arrival at customer location, scanner confirmation of delivery, brief dwell time, and departure. An "Unscheduled Stop" may show similar arrival and departure patterns but lacks scanner confirmation events and often occurs at locations not matching planned delivery points. "Traffic Delays" appear as extended periods of low-speed movement without complete stops, distinguishable from brief stops at traffic signals by duration and speed profiles.

### 1.3 Conformance Checking Against Planned Routes

Conformance checking compares the observed process behavior against a reference model—here, the planned routes from the dispatch system—to identify and quantify deviations.

**Reference Model Construction**

The dispatch system provides the planned route as a sequence of stops with estimated travel times and scheduled delivery windows. This planned route serves as the reference model against which actual execution is compared. However, the reference model requires transformation from its native format (typically a list of stops with time estimates) into a process model suitable for conformance checking.

The transformation involves constructing an expected activity sequence: from depot departure, through each planned stop in sequence, to depot return. Each planned stop carries an expected service time based on historical averages or package characteristics. The model also defines expected travel times between stops based on dispatch system estimates, which may incorporate historical traffic patterns but lack real-time adjustments.

**Deviation Detection and Classification**

Conformance checking identifies several categories of deviation that are particularly relevant for logistics operations. Sequence deviations occur when the driver visits stops in a different order than planned. This may result from driver intuition about traffic conditions, customer requests for time changes, or deliberate route optimization based on real-time information. Some sequence deviations may improve efficiency; others may indicate confusion or poor planning.

Timing deviations involve differences between planned and actual activity durations or timestamps. Extended service times at customer locations may indicate difficulties finding parking, complex delivery requirements, or customer interaction issues. Shorter-than-expected service times may suggest incomplete deliveries or scanning errors. Travel time deviations between stops may reveal inaccurate dispatch estimates, unexpected traffic conditions, or inefficient routing.

Unplanned activities represent behavior not captured in the reference model entirely. Unscheduled stops may indicate vehicle problems, driver breaks not in the plan, or emergency deviations. Failed delivery attempts introduce a planned resequencing requirement that the dispatch system may not have anticipated. Maintenance events during shifts represent significant unplanned deviations with cost implications.

**Token-Based Replay and Deviation Quantification**

Token-based replay provides a mechanism to quantify conformance deviations systematically. Tokens traverse the reference model following the planned sequence. When the actual event log shows different behavior, tokens may need to be inserted (for unplanned activities), skipped (for skipped activities), or moved (for sequence deviations). The replay produces aggregate metrics including fitness (the proportion of behavior explained by the model), precision (the degree to which the model restricts behavior to what was observed), and generalization (how well the model predicts behavior in new cases).

For operational reporting, a more intuitive set of conformance metrics serves management needs: on-time performance per stop, deviation from planned route sequence, frequency and duration of unscheduled stops, and overall route completion rate.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### 2.1 Key Performance Indicator Framework

Effective performance management requires a structured KPI framework that connects operational activities to business objectives. For Speedy Parcels, the framework addresses both punctuality (customer-facing service level) and cost efficiency (internal operational performance).

**Delivery Punctuality Metrics**

The On-Time Delivery Rate represents the most critical customer-facing metric, calculated as the percentage of deliveries completed within their promised time windows. This metric requires careful definition of "completion time"—whether it marks the arrival at the customer location, the completion of delivery scanning, or some other milestone. The recommended definition uses the "Delivery Success" scanner event as the completion timestamp, compared against the customer-requested delivery window from the dispatch system. Analysis should segment this metric by time of day, day of week, geographic region, and package type to identify patterns.

Average Delivery Cycle Time measures the elapsed time from driver arrival at a customer location to departure, encompassing all service activities. This metric, calculated from "Arrive Customer" to "Depart Customer" scanner events, reveals the time required for parking, customer interaction, package handover, and documentation. High cycle times at specific locations or during specific periods may indicate parking challenges, customer accessibility issues, or procedural inefficiencies.

First-Attempt Delivery Success Rate captures the proportion of deliveries completed successfully on the first visit, calculated as successful deliveries divided by total delivery attempts. Failed deliveries impose significant costs through redelivery requirements and customer dissatisfaction. This metric should distinguish between failure types (customer not available, access issues, delivery refused) to guide targeted improvements.

**Operational Efficiency Metrics**

Time Utilization Ratio distinguishes between time spent traveling and time spent in service activities. Calculated as total service time divided by total route duration (from departure to return), this ratio reveals how much of the working day is devoted to value-generating activities versus transit. Low ratios may indicate excessive travel time, inefficient route sequencing, or excessive waiting/idling time.

Travel Time Variance measures the variability in travel times between stops compared to dispatch estimates. High variance introduces uncertainty into scheduling and may indicate reliance on outdated or inaccurate travel time models. This metric, calculated as the standard deviation of (actual travel time minus estimated travel time), should be analyzed by time period and route segment to identify systematic estimation errors.

Vehicle Utilization Rate considers both capacity utilization and time utilization. Capacity utilization, calculated as actual packages carried versus vehicle capacity, reveals load efficiency. Time utilization considers the proportion of available time the vehicle spends in productive movement versus idle time. The integrated utilization metric combines these dimensions to reveal overall asset efficiency.

Fuel Consumption Efficiency, expressed as fuel consumed per kilometer driven or per package delivered, connects operational activity to cost. This metric requires integration of fuel purchase or telemetry data with GPS-derived distance calculations. Analysis should identify factors contributing to high fuel consumption, including aggressive driving patterns, excessive idling, route inefficiencies, and vehicle condition.

**Maintenance and Reliability Metrics**

Unscheduled Maintenance Frequency counts maintenance events that occur during active delivery shifts rather than during scheduled maintenance windows. High unscheduled maintenance frequency indicates vehicle reliability problems that disrupt operations and increase costs. The metric, calculated as unscheduled maintenance events per vehicle per operating period, should trigger investigation into whether certain vehicle types, age categories, or usage patterns correlate with reliability issues.

Mean Time Between Failures provides a reliability measure for each vehicle, calculated as total operating hours divided by the number of failure incidents. This metric supports vehicle replacement planning and identification of vehicles requiring intensive maintenance attention.

### 2.2 Bottleneck Identification Techniques

Process mining offers multiple techniques for identifying bottlenecks—points in the process where flow is constricted or delayed. For logistics operations, bottlenecks may manifest as geographic locations, temporal patterns, activity types, or resource constraints.

**Performance Spectrum Analysis**

The performance spectrum technique visualizes the process flow with performance (duration) overlaid on the process model connections. For Speedy Parcels, constructing a performance spectrum reveals which transitions between activities exhibit the longest durations. A spectrum showing consistently long durations between "Depart Customer Stop N" and "Arrive Customer Stop N+1" points to travel time as the constraining factor. Long durations between "Arrive Customer" and "Delivery Success" point to service time bottlenecks. Long durations between "Delivery Success" and "Depart Customer" may indicate post-delivery administrative activities or difficulty returning to the vehicle.

The performance spectrum should be constructed for different case filters—different vehicles, drivers, days of week, or geographic regions—to reveal whether bottlenecks are systemic or context-specific. A bottleneck that appears across all filters represents a fundamental process constraint; one that appears only under specific conditions represents an opportunity for conditional optimization.

**Bottleneck Duration Analysis**

Aggregated bottleneck analysis examines activity durations across the entire event log to identify activities with the highest total time contribution. While individual service stops may be brief, their cumulative impact across many stops can represent the largest time consumer. This analysis uses the following calculation: for each activity type, sum the duration of all instances, then express as a percentage of total process time.

For Speedy Parcels, this analysis typically reveals that travel time between stops represents the largest time component, followed by aggregate service time at customer locations. However, aggregate analysis may mask important variation—while average service time might be five minutes, the 95th percentile might be fifteen minutes, indicating a subset of problematic stops that warrant investigation.

**Bottleneck Correlation with Context Factors**

Effective bottleneck identification requires understanding the factors that influence duration. Correlation analysis examines how bottleneck durations relate to contextual variables. Geographic correlation links long travel times or service times to specific locations or zones, potentially identifying traffic congestion areas, parking-challenged neighborhoods, or customer locations with service difficulties. Temporal correlation links durations to time of day, day of week, or seasonal patterns, revealing rush hour impacts, weekend variations, or weather-related effects. Resource correlation links durations to specific drivers, vehicles, or shift patterns, identifying skill differences, vehicle condition effects, or fatigue impacts on later shifts.

The analysis should employ statistical techniques—regression analysis for continuous outcomes, classification and regression trees for identifying interaction effects—to build predictive models of duration determinants.

**Queueing Analysis at Delivery Points**

At high-volume delivery locations, drivers may experience queuing delays as they wait for previous drivers to complete deliveries and free up loading areas or parking spaces. The event log can reveal queuing patterns through analysis of arrival time distributions at shared locations. If multiple vehicles consistently arrive at the same location during the same time window, and subsequent events show extended wait times, queuing may be constraining throughput.

Queueing analysis should also consider internal depot operations. Long times between "Depart Depot" scanner events and actual GPS departure from depot coordinates may indicate loading delays, documentation processing, or vehicle preparation issues.

### 2.3 Quantifying Bottleneck Impact

Identifying bottlenecks is necessary but insufficient for prioritization; the analysis must also quantify the business impact of each bottleneck to guide improvement investment.

**Impact Calculation Methodology**

Bottleneck impact calculation considers three dimensions: frequency (how often the bottleneck occurs), magnitude (how much delay or cost the bottleneck imposes), and scope (how many cases or resources are affected). The total impact score combines these dimensions: impact equals frequency multiplied by magnitude multiplied by scope.

For travel time bottlenecks, frequency equals the number of affected route segments, magnitude equals average excess time compared to plan or benchmark, and scope equals the number of vehicles or drivers affected. For service time bottlenecks, similar calculation applies using service duration metrics.

**Prioritization Framework**

Bottlenecks should be mapped to a prioritization matrix considering both impact severity and improvement feasibility. High-impact, high-feasibility bottlenecks warrant immediate attention. High-impact, low-feasibility bottlenecks require strategic planning or investment. Low-impact bottlenecks, regardless of feasibility, offer limited return on improvement effort.

For Speedy Parcels, typical prioritization might place traffic-related travel time improvements in the high-impact, medium-feasibility category (requiring route optimization or timing adjustments but not major capital investment), while parking-related service time extensions might fall into high-impact, low-feasibility category (requiring customer negotiations or infrastructure changes beyond company control).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Categories of Potential Root Causes

Moving from bottleneck identification to root cause understanding requires systematic investigation of the factors that generate observed inefficiencies. The analysis framework considers five categories of potential root causes, each requiring different analytical approaches for validation.

**Route Planning and Optimization Quality**

Suboptimal route planning manifests as inefficient sequences, poor time estimation, or inappropriate resource allocation. Static route planning that fails to incorporate real-time traffic conditions may produce routes that appear optimal on paper but perform poorly in execution. Routes designed without consideration of driver familiarity or customer access patterns may include inherently problematic segments.

Validation approach: Compare performance metrics across routes of similar characteristics (distance, stop count, geographic scope) to identify systematic variation. Routes consistently underperforming peers indicate planning methodology issues. Compare planned versus actual times at the segment level to identify systematic over- or underestimation patterns.

**Traffic and Environmental Factors**

Urban traffic congestion introduces variability and delay that static planning cannot anticipate. The impact varies by time of day, day of week, season, and special events. Congestion effects compound when routes pass through traffic hotspots during peak periods. Weather conditions affect both traffic flow and delivery conditions.

Validation approach: Correlate travel time deviations with external data sources—traffic monitoring feeds, weather records, event calendars—to quantify environmental contribution to delays. Segment analysis by time period reveals whether congestion effects are localized to specific windows or pervasive throughout operating hours.

**Customer and Service Variability**

Service time variability at customer locations reflects diverse delivery circumstances: building access requirements, recipient availability, package size and handling needs, and customer interaction preferences. High variability makes scheduling difficult and creates uncertainty that propagates through subsequent stops.

Validation approach: Variance component analysis decomposes total service time variation into portions attributable to customer location, time of day, package type, and driver. If customer location explains most variance, this points to location-specific factors requiring location-specific solutions rather than general process changes.

**Vehicle Reliability and Maintenance**

Vehicle breakdowns and maintenance needs during shifts represent acute disruptions with cascading effects on route completion. Chronic vehicle issues may also manifest as reduced fuel efficiency, degraded performance, or increased driver stress affecting service quality.

Validation approach: Correlate maintenance log entries with operational metrics to identify vehicles with disproportionate cost or reliability impact. Analyze whether maintenance needs correlate with specific usage patterns—high mileage, specific route types, or driver behavior patterns.

**Driver Factors and Behavioral Variation**

Driver skill, experience, and behavior significantly influence delivery efficiency. Experienced drivers may navigate more efficiently, interact more effectively with customers, and handle exceptions more smoothly. Conversely, inefficient driving patterns—rapid acceleration, excessive idling, or suboptimal speed—increase fuel consumption and wear.

Validation approach: Two-stage analysis first controls for case characteristics (route difficulty, customer mix, traffic conditions) before comparing driver performance. Drivers consistently outperforming or underperforming peers after appropriate control warrant investigation of behavioral differences.

### 3.2 Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Validation

**Variant Analysis for Performance Decomposition**

Variant analysis groups process cases by their execution pattern and compares performance across variants. For Speedy Parcels, variants may be defined by route sequence (the order of stops visited), deviation pattern (the nature and frequency of deviations from plan), or stop completion pattern (success versus failure at each stop).

The analysis approach constructs a variant frequency matrix showing how often each pattern occurs, then overlays performance metrics on this matrix. High-frequency, low-performance variants represent priority improvement targets. The question to answer: what distinguishes high-performing variants from low-performing ones?

Consider a scenario where some drivers consistently achieve high first-attempt delivery rates while others struggle. Variant analysis might reveal that high performers systematically attempt deliveries in a particular sequence (perhaps prioritizing locations with better parking or higher recipient availability probability), while low performers follow the dispatch sequence rigidly. This finding would point to sequence optimization or driver discretion policies as improvement levers.

**Correlation Analysis Across Process Dimensions**

Process mining tools support correlation analysis examining relationships between case attributes and process metrics. For Speedy Parcels, relevant correlations include: Does vehicle age correlate with unscheduled maintenance frequency? Does driver experience correlate with service time or fuel efficiency? Does stop density correlate with travel time variance? Does time of day correlate with delivery success rate?

Correlation analysis should employ appropriate statistical methods—Pearson correlation for continuous variables, point-biserial correlation for categorical versus continuous, chi-square tests for categorical versus categorical. The analysis should report not only correlation strength but also statistical significance and practical importance.

**Dwell Time and Stop Analysis**

Dwell time analysis examines the duration and characteristics of stops throughout the delivery process. The analysis distinguishes between planned stops (customer delivery locations), unplanned stops (breaks, vehicle issues, navigation stops), and extended stops (where dwell time significantly exceeds typical duration for that location type).

For each stop category, the analysis characterizes typical duration, variability, and contributing factors. Extended unplanned stops warrant particular attention—the root cause might be traffic congestion requiring route adjustment, vehicle issues requiring maintenance response, or driver behavior requiring coaching. The analysis should correlate extended stops with contextual factors to distinguish between these possibilities.

**Social Network Analysis of Driver Interactions**

In complex delivery operations, drivers may communicate with each other or with dispatch to resolve issues, coordinate handoffs, or share information about conditions. Social network analysis of communication patterns—though requiring data sources beyond the current event log—can reveal collaborative patterns that influence performance.

Even without explicit communication data, the event log can reveal implicit coordination: multiple drivers visiting similar areas at similar times, or drivers modifying routes in ways that suggest shared information about conditions. Patterns of convergence or divergence may indicate effective coordination or problematic information sharing.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### 4.1 Dynamic Routing Optimization Based on Real-Time Process Insights

**Targeted Inefficiency and Root Cause**

This strategy addresses the systemic inefficiency of static route planning that fails to adapt to real-time conditions. The root cause lies in dispatch systems that optimize routes based on historical averages without incorporating current traffic conditions, weather, or events. The result is systematic underperformance during congested periods and failure to exploit opportunities when conditions are favorable.

**Optimization Approach**

The optimization system ingests real-time data streams—traffic feeds, weather reports, event calendars, and ongoing GPS traces from the delivery fleet—and continuously adjusts route assignments to optimize overall fleet performance. When traffic congestion develops on a planned route segment, the system evaluates alternative routes, considers the impact on subsequent stops, and issues updated instructions when the benefit exceeds the disruption cost of route change.

Process mining insights directly inform the optimization algorithm. Historical analysis reveals which route segments exhibit highest travel time variability, enabling the system to build in appropriate buffers or prioritize alternatives for high-variance segments. Analysis of driver performance variations informs driver-route matching, assigning complex routes to experienced drivers and simpler routes to trainees during high-stakes periods.

The system also incorporates learned patterns about customer availability. Historical data on delivery success rates by time of day and day of week enables probabilistic scheduling that avoids sending drivers to likely-unavailable customers during low-success windows.

**Data Support and Validation**

The proposed optimization builds directly on process mining findings. Travel time variance analysis identifies segments where real-time adjustment offers greatest benefit. Bottleneck analysis reveals geographic areas where delays are most severe and alternative routes most valuable. Variant analysis of high-performing versus low-performing executions identifies behavioral patterns that the optimization system can encode as rules or machine learning features.

Before full deployment, the optimization should be validated through controlled trials: a subset of routes executed with dynamic optimization compared against control routes following standard procedures. The trial design should ensure statistical validity through randomization and adequate sample size.

**Expected KPI Impacts**

Successful implementation should improve On-Time Delivery Rate by reducing traffic-related delays, with expected improvement of 5-15 percentage points depending on baseline traffic conditions. Travel Time Variance should decrease as real-time conditions replace static estimates. Fuel Consumption Efficiency should improve through reduced congestion-related idling and optimized routing. Driver satisfaction may improve through reduced frustration from unexpected delays.

### 4.2 Predictive Maintenance Program Based on Vehicle Usage Patterns

**Targeted Inefficiency and Root Cause**

This strategy addresses unscheduled maintenance events that disrupt operations and increase long-term vehicle costs. The root cause is reactive maintenance—addressing issues only after they cause failures—rather than proactive maintenance based on component wear patterns. Current maintenance scheduling may follow time-based intervals that fail to match actual component degradation rates, resulting in both premature maintenance (replacing still-functional components) and delayed maintenance (experiencing failures before scheduled replacement).

**Optimization Approach**

The predictive maintenance system analyzes vehicle usage patterns from GPS and maintenance logs to predict component failure probabilities and optimize maintenance scheduling. The system tracks mileage, driving behavior patterns (rapid acceleration, extended idling), and route characteristics (grade, terrain, stop frequency) that influence component wear.

Machine learning models predict remaining useful life for critical components based on usage history and failure patterns from similar vehicles. When predicted remaining life falls below a threshold, the system schedules maintenance during optimal windows—avoiding peak delivery periods, coordinating with vehicle availability, and ensuring substitute vehicles are ready.

Process mining analysis of maintenance events correlating with usage patterns informs the prediction models. Vehicles exhibiting aggressive driving patterns show accelerated brake wear; vehicles assigned to routes with frequent stop-and-go traffic show faster engine component degradation. These patterns enable component-specific predictions that outperform generic mileage-based schedules.

**Data Support and Validation**

Maintenance log analysis provides the foundation, correlating failure events with prior usage patterns across the fleet. Vehicles with similar usage profiles to failed vehicles receive elevated failure probability estimates. GPS-derived driving behavior metrics—acceleration profiles, idle time, speed consistency—serve as leading indicators of component stress.

The predictive model requires validation through historical backtesting: using data from earlier periods to predict failures in later periods, measuring prediction accuracy and timeliness. Model performance metrics should include prediction precision (proportion of predicted failures that actually occur), recall (proportion of actual failures that were predicted), and lead time (how far in advance predictions occur, enabling scheduling).

**Expected KPI Impacts**

Unscheduled Maintenance Frequency should decrease significantly as the program transitions from reactive to proactive maintenance. Mean Time Between Failures should increase as components are replaced before failure based on predicted wear. Total maintenance costs should decrease through optimized replacement timing—replacing components at optimal wear points rather than too early or too late. On-time delivery rates should improve as fewer routes are disrupted by vehicle failures.

### 4.3 Delivery Territory and Sequence Optimization

**Targeted Inefficiency and Root Cause**

This strategy addresses inefficiencies arising from suboptimal territory design and stop sequencing. The root cause may be legacy territory boundaries that no longer match current delivery volumes, asymmetric workload distribution across vehicles and drivers, or dispatch algorithms that optimize locally (individual routes) rather than globally (fleet-wide efficiency).

**Optimization Approach**

The territory optimization system analyzes historical delivery data to identify opportunities for redistributing stops across territories, vehicles, and drivers. The analysis considers multiple factors: geographic clustering of deliveries, volume trends by area, vehicle capacity constraints, driver familiarity and performance by territory, and infrastructure characteristics (parking availability, access constraints).

The optimization employs advanced algorithms—often based on vehicle routing problem variants with additional constraints—to generate territory configurations that balance workload, minimize total travel, and respect capacity and time window constraints. The system may recommend territory boundary adjustments, vehicle reassignments, or swap of specific stops between routes.

Process mining variant analysis informs territory design by identifying natural clustering in delivery patterns. Routes that consistently exhibit similar sequences and timing may indicate territories that align well with underlying geographic or customer patterns. Routes requiring excessive travel between clusters may indicate poorly designed territories.

The optimization also considers temporal factors: adjusting territory boundaries to account for traffic patterns that make certain cross-territory movements efficient during some periods but inefficient during others. Dynamic territory adjustments may be appropriate for periods with unusual demand patterns.

**Data Support and Validation**

Historical route performance data provides the evidence base for optimization. Analysis of total travel time, delivery success rate, and resource utilization by current territory reveals imbalances and inefficiencies. Comparison of high-performing versus low-performing territories identifies characteristics of effective territory design.

Validation requires careful change management: territory changes affect driver routines and customer relationships, requiring communication and transition support. Pilot implementations in limited areas allow assessment of impacts before fleet-wide deployment. Customer impact monitoring ensures service quality is maintained through transitions.

**Expected KPI Impacts**

Time Utilization Ratio should improve as reduced travel time between stops increases the proportion of time in productive service activities. Travel Time Variance should decrease as territories align better with natural geographic clusters. Vehicle Utilization Rate should improve through more balanced workloads across the fleet. Driver satisfaction may improve through more reasonable and predictable workloads.

### 4.4 Customer Communication and Time Window Management

**Targeted Inefficiency and Root Cause**

This strategy addresses the high rate of failed delivery attempts and associated redelivery costs. The root cause lies in mismatched expectations: customers request delivery time windows that prove impractical given route optimization requirements, or they receive notification of imminent delivery while away from the provided location.

**Optimization Approach**

The customer communication system redesigns time window management based on process mining insights about actual delivery patterns. Rather than promising narrow time windows that cannot reliably be met, the system offers probabilistic windows based on historical performance for similar deliveries. Customers receive updated estimates as the delivery day progresses, with progressively narrower windows as the driver approaches.

The system incorporates learned patterns about customer availability. Historical data revealing consistent unavailability during certain periods informs scheduling algorithms that avoid assigning those customers to windows during likely-absence times. Customers with unpredictable availability receive alternative delivery options—nighttime drop-off, neighbor handoff, or collection point delivery—that reduce failed attempt rates.

Process mining analysis of failed deliveries correlating with time window characteristics reveals whether failed attempts concentrate around specific window types or times. If failed attempts concentrate in morning windows, this may indicate customers who leave for work before delivery; afternoon windows may indicate different patterns. These insights enable differentiated strategies for different customer segments.

**Data Support and Validation**

Failed delivery analysis correlating with time windows, customer segments, and geographic areas identifies patterns in unavailability. Customer survey data can validate assumptions about availability patterns and preferences. Comparison of time windows against actual delivery times reveals systematic over-promising or accurate estimation.

The optimization requires pilot testing with customer communication changes, measuring impacts on both failed delivery rates and customer satisfaction. Trade-offs may exist: offering wider time windows may reduce failed attempts but increase customer inconvenience from less precise scheduling.

**Expected KPI Impacts**

First-Attempt Delivery Success Rate should improve through better scheduling and customer communication. Customer satisfaction metrics should improve through more reliable delivery experiences and proactive communication about delays. Redelivery costs should decrease as fewer failed attempts require subsequent visits.

## 5. Operational Constraints and Monitoring Framework

### 5.1 Constraint Consideration in Optimization Design

**Driver Working Hours Compliance**

All optimization strategies must operate within regulatory and contractual constraints on driver working hours. Dynamic routing optimizations that add driving time or sequence changes that extend shifts violate these constraints. The optimization system must incorporate hard constraints on shift duration, driving time, and required breaks.

Implementation requires integration with driver scheduling systems to understand available hours for each driver on each day. Route assignments must leave adequate margins for unexpected delays without pushing against hour limits. When delays threaten to exceed available hours, the system should proactively trigger relief driver dispatch or customer notification of next-day delivery rather than allowing violations.

The process mining analysis of shift patterns—inclusive of overtime frequency, end-of-shift timing, and break compliance—informs constraint modeling. If analysis reveals systematic overtime, this may indicate underestimation of route duration in planning rather than driver performance issues.

**Vehicle Capacity and Constraints**

Optimization strategies must respect vehicle capacity limits and constraints. Dynamic routing cannot assign more stops to a vehicle than its capacity allows, even if that would be efficient. Specialized vehicles may be required for certain package types (refrigerated goods, oversized items) or customer locations (limited access).

The optimization system maintains a vehicle-capability matrix mapping each vehicle to its capacity and profile. Route assignments filter based on package requirements, ensuring each stop's requirements can be met by the assigned vehicle. Capacity constraints should include both volume and weight dimensions, as some dense packages may fill capacity before volume limits.

Process mining analysis of capacity utilization reveals patterns in load efficiency. Routes consistently approaching capacity limits may indicate territory imbalances or vehicle assignment issues. Routes with consistently low utilization suggest opportunity for load consolidation or territory rebalancing.

**Customer Time Window Requirements**

Customer-requested delivery time windows represent hard constraints that cannot be violated without customer agreement. Dynamic routing must respect these windows while optimizing overall efficiency. When route conditions threaten on-time performance against a committed window, the system must choose between accepting delay (and potential penalty), reassigning to another driver with better positioning, or contacting the customer for window relaxation.

The optimization system should incorporate customer segmentation based on time window flexibility. Some customers require precise timing for business operations; others are flexible on timing. The system prioritizes tight-window customers while optimizing around flexible customers to absorb variability.

Process mining analysis of time window adherence reveals which customer segments and window types are most challenging. This informs both operational planning (allocating more time buffer for difficult windows) and commercial policy (pricing or promoting flexible delivery options).

### 5.2 Continuous Monitoring Framework

**Process Mining Dashboard Design**

Effective continuous monitoring requires a dashboard system that presents key metrics and process views at appropriate levels for different stakeholders. The dashboard architecture should support drilling from fleet-level aggregates down to individual routes, stops, and events.

The executive dashboard presents fleet-wide KPIs: overall on-time delivery rate, average cost per delivery, vehicle utilization, and maintenance cost trends. Trend lines show performance over time, with alerts for significant changes from baseline. Comparative views show performance across regions, vehicle fleets, or time periods.

The operations dashboard provides more granular views for dispatch and planning teams: current route status, vehicles running behind schedule, emerging delay patterns, and resource availability. Real-time updates enable proactive intervention before delays compound.

The analytics dashboard supports deeper investigation by process mining analysts: process model visualizations, variant performance comparisons, bottleneck analysis, and correlation explorers. These views support both routine performance review and investigation of specific issues or improvement opportunities.

**Key Metrics for Ongoing Monitoring**

The monitoring framework should track metrics across four dimensions. Punctuality metrics include daily on-time delivery rate by region and fleet segment, average delay duration for late deliveries, and percentage of deliveries completing within one hour of promised window. Efficiency metrics include average cost per delivery (fuel, maintenance, labor), travel time versus planned time by route segment, and vehicle utilization rate by vehicle type and assignment. Quality metrics include first-attempt delivery success rate by customer segment, customer complaint rate and type distribution, and scanning compliance rate (percentage of required scans completed). Reliability metrics include unscheduled maintenance events per vehicle per period, mean time between failures by vehicle age cohort, and schedule adherence percentage.

**Anomaly Detection and Alerting**

Beyond point-in-time metrics, the monitoring system should implement statistical process control to detect emerging issues. Control charts for key metrics establish normal variation ranges; observations outside these ranges trigger investigation alerts.

The anomaly detection should consider multiple alert types. Static threshold alerts trigger when metrics exceed predetermined limits (on-time rate below 90 percent). Trend alerts trigger when metrics show systematic change over periods (declining performance over three consecutive days). Correlation alerts trigger when expected relationships break down (vehicle utilization increasing while on-time rate decreases, suggesting quality-quantity trade-off).

Alert routing ensures issues reach appropriate responders. Operational alerts (vehicle running significantly behind schedule) reach dispatch. Quality alerts (increasing failed delivery rate) reach operations management. Technical alerts (system data quality issues) reach IT support.

**Improvement Tracking and Documentation**

The monitoring framework should support continuous improvement through structured tracking of change initiatives. Each optimization strategy implemented should have associated baseline metrics, target improvements, and regular progress tracking. When improvements are achieved, the documentation supports institutional learning and provides evidence for expanding successful initiatives.

The framework should also support counterfactual analysis: when performance changes, the system should support investigation of whether changes are attributable to specific initiatives, external factors (weather, traffic events), or random variation. This analytical rigor prevents false attribution and supports genuine learning.

## Conclusion

Process mining offers Speedy Parcels a powerful framework for transforming their rich operational data into actionable insights. The methodology outlined in this report—from careful data integration through process discovery, performance analysis, root cause identification, and optimization—provides a systematic path to improved delivery punctuality and reduced operational costs.

The key to success lies in treating this as an ongoing capability rather than a one-time analysis. The logistics environment continuously evolves: traffic patterns shift, customer behaviors change, and the competitive landscape demands ongoing adaptation. A mature process mining capability, supported by appropriate tooling and analytical skills, enables continuous optimization rather than periodic improvement.

The recommended optimization strategies—dynamic routing, predictive maintenance, territory optimization, and customer communication improvement—address different dimensions of the operation while reinforcing each other. Dynamic routing reduces traffic-related delays; predictive maintenance reduces disruption from vehicle failures; territory optimization improves base efficiency; and customer communication reduces failed attempts. Together, these strategies can significantly improve Speedy Parcels' competitive position while building the analytical capability for ongoing optimization.

Implementation should proceed incrementally: pilot each strategy in limited scope, validate impacts, refine approaches based on learning, and expand successful initiatives fleet-wide. Throughout implementation, the continuous monitoring framework ensures that changes achieve intended impacts and reveals any unintended consequences requiring correction. This disciplined approach transforms process mining from an analytical exercise into an operational capability that delivers sustained competitive advantage.
