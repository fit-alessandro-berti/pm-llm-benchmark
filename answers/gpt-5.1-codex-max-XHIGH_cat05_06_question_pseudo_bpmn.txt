1. What criteria were used to select the specific countries for component sourcing, and how do geopolitical risks factor into this choice?  
2. How does the parallel procurement of different components affect overall lead times, and are there any dependencies that could cause bottlenecks?  
3. In what ways could the R&D process be integrated with supply chain planning to accelerate time to market without compromising quality?  
4. How might changes in market demand during the assembly phase influence production scheduling or component orders?  
5. What mechanisms are in place to mitigate risks of component shortages, and how do supplier diversification strategies impact cost and quality?  
6. How is the decision made to ship via air freight versus cargo ship, and what trade-offs exist between cost, speed, and environmental impact?  
7. How might emerging technologies (e.g., IoT tracking, blockchain) improve transparency and efficiency across the supply chain?  
8. What key performance indicators (KPIs) are tracked during quality checks, and how are these metrics used to refine the assembly process?  
9. How does the company manage inventory levels in regional distribution centers to avoid overstocking or stockouts?  
10. What contingency plans are in place if a major supplier fails to deliver on time, and how are these plans tested?  
11. How do customs regulations differ across regions, and what processes ensure continuous compliance as rules change?  
12. How are feedback loops structured between retail partners, e-commerce channels, and supply chain planners to improve forecasting accuracy?  
13. In what ways does stakeholder communication influence decisions at key gateways, such as whether to rework or scrap units that fail quality checks?  
14. How does the process address sustainability concerns, particularly around packaging, shipping methods, and end-of-life product management?  
15. What data sources are used to monitor real-time demand, and how do these inform adjustments to supplier orders?  
16. How are cost and risk balanced when choosing assembly locations, and what factors might prompt a shift to another region?  
17. What collaborative practices with suppliers are in place to ensure ethical sourcing and compliance with labor standards?  
18. How is the effectiveness of the “Direct Shipments for VIP/Pre-Orders” pathway measured, and what criteria justify its continuation or expansion?  
19. What role do scenario planning and simulation play in refining the distribution split between air and sea freight under varying demand conditions?
