Process mining is a technology that can be used to discover, model, monitor, and optimize business processes. In the context of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), process mining can be used to identify opportunities for automation and to monitor the performance of RPA bots. Process mining can also be used to continuously improve RPA initiatives by identifying areas for optimization and providing insights into the performance of RPA bots. By leveraging process mining, organizations can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their RPA initiatives, leading to greater productivity and cost savings.
