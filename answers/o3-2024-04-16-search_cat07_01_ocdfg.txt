What you are looking at is a process-flow (or process-mining) diagram that combines five closely-related business object lifecycles into one integrated view.  
The picture answers three basic questions at once:

1. Which activities belong to each object type? (colour coding)  
2. In what sequence do they happen? (arrows)  
3. How often and how fast do they happen? (volumes inside the boxes, lead-times on the arrows)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Object types and colour legend
• Purchase Requisition Item(purple) – 2.0 M items  
• Return Order Item(green) – 0.8 M items  
• Vendor Invoice Item(teal) – 1.2 M items  
• Sales Order Item(brown) – 3.5 M items  
• Purchase Order Item(blue) – 5.0 M items  

Every activity box contains one or more small coloured dots that tell you which object type(s) perform that activity. The connectors carry the same colour so you can follow each lifecycle independently or see where they overlap.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. High-level flow

Purchase-requisition path (purple)
Start  Create Requisition (3.0 M occurrences)  Approve Requisition (5.7 M)   
• Send Order (5.2 M)  End  
• Check Stock (1.0 M)  …  
• Approve Payment  Create Invoice  End  

Return-order path (green)
Start  Process Return (0.8 M)  Approve Requisition  Approve Payment  Create Invoice  End  

Vendor-invoice path (teal)
Start  Send Order  Approve Requisition  Approve Payment  Create Invoice  End  

Sales-order path (brown)
Start  Create Order (8.5 M)  Pack Goods  Ship Goods  Confirm Delivery  Close Order  End  

Purchase-order path (blue)
Start  Create Order  (joins the purple path) Approve Requisition  Approve Payment  Create Invoice  End  

The central “hubs” are therefore:
• Approve Requisition – touched by every single object type  
• Approve Payment and Create Invoice – shared by four of the five  

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Performance information

• Numbers in each activity box show the overall frequency.  
  Example: “Create Order – Overall: 8.5 M” means all object types together executed that step 8.5 million times.  

• Numbers on the arrows are average throughput times between the two connected events.  
  Example: the blue arrow “400 ms” between Start and Create Order on the purchase-order line means it takes 0.4 seconds on average to get from ‘Start’ to ‘Create Order’ for that item type.  

• You can read bottlenecks quickly: the longest labelled intervals are 800 ms from Process Return to Approve Payment (green) and 650 ms from Approve Requisition to Process Return (green), so the return process is the slowest part of the entire landscape.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
What the diagram tells you in one sentence:
Five different order-related processes share a common backbone (approval, payment, invoicing); sales orders branch out into their own fulfilment steps, while returns are the slowest sub-process, and all timings are currently well below one second end-to-end.
