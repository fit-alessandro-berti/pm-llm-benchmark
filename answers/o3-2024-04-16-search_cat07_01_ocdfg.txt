The picture is a “process-flow map” that has been generated from event-log data (typical of process-mining software such as Celonis, UiPath Process Mining, etc.).  
Reading it from top to bottom you can see, step-by-step, how five different object types move through an order-to-cash / procure-to-pay lifecycle and how long the typical hand-offs take.

1. Object types at the top  
   • VendorInvoiceItem – 1.2 million items (green)  
   • ReturnOrderItem – 0.8 million items (red)  
   • PurchaseRequisitionItem – 2.0 million items (purple)  
   • SalesOrderItem – 3.5 million items (orange)  
   • PurchaseOrderItem – 5.0 million items (blue)  
   Each type begins at its own “Start” event (small ellipse).

2. Converging into the common process  
   • Purchase-requisition items first go through “Create Requisition” (3.0 M cases) and reach “Approve Requisition” (5.7 M cases).  
   • Return orders also feed directly into “Approve Requisition,” while vendor invoices, sales orders and purchase orders join the flow a bit later.  
   • Coloured dots inside every activity box show which of the five object classes visit that activity; the outline colour of the connecting arrows matches those dots, so you can follow each class separately or see where they overlap.

3. Mid-process branching  
   From “Approve Requisition” four main branches leave at different average transfer times (numbers on the arrows are mean durations in milliseconds):
   • “Send Order” (purple/blue) – 5.2 M executions, then it ends.  
   • “Check Stock” (purple) – 1.0 M executions, may loop back into other steps.  
   • “Process Return” (green/red) – 0.8 M executions, heading toward credit processing.  
   • “Approve Payment” (blue) – 1.5 M executions, which later leads to invoicing.

4. Down-stream logistics for sales orders  
   Sales-order items (orange) branch rightwards:
   • “Create Order” (8.5 M)  “Pack Goods” (2.0 M)  “Ship Goods” (1.8 M)  “Confirm Delivery” (1.7 M)  “Close Order” (1.7 M)  End.  
   Typical transfer times shrink as the chain approaches completion (400 ms from Start to Create Order, 300 ms to Pack Goods, etc.).

5. Financial completion  
   • After “Approve Payment” the flow goes to “Create Invoice” (2.0 M) and then finishes.  
   • Vendor-invoice items can also enter directly into “Create Invoice.”

6. Ends  
   Every distinct path eventually terminates in its own “End” ellipse. Multiple “End” symbols remind us that the system has more than one natural finishing point (e.g., when an order is shipped vs. when a return is processed).

What the diagram tells you at a glance
• Volume: The “Overall” counters inside each box show how many times that activity occurred across the imported log.  
• Performance: The small labels on each arrow give the mean waiting or processing time between two consecutive activities (in milliseconds). You can immediately spot bottlenecks (longer numbers) or light-weight transitions (short numbers).  
• Variants: Colour coding plus overlaid dots show which object types actually traverse a node, making variant comparison easy: some activities are purely “orange” (sales-order only), others mix several colours, revealing cross-object interaction points such as “Approve Requisition.”

In short, it is a multi-variant, colour-coded swim-lane of the company’s purchase-to-pay and order-to-cash processes, complete with activity frequencies and average lead-times, letting analysts see how different document objects interweave and where the slow-downs or re-work cycles occur.
