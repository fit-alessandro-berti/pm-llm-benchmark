Based on the provided directly follows graph for each object type, here's a description of the process underlying this data:

1. **Customers**
   - Customers place orders (`place order` -> `confirm order`, frequency = 1495).
   - After confirming their order, customers can either place another order (`confirm order` -> `place order`, frequency = 1480) or wait for the process to continue.

2. **Orders**
   - Once an order is confirmed by a customer, it's ready for picking (`confirm order` -> `pick item`, frequency varies by object type).
   - After all items are picked, the order can be paid (`pay order`, frequency varies by object type).

3. **Items/Products**
   - Items are picked from inventory after an order is confirmed (`confirm order` -> `pick item`, frequency varies by object type and other factors like employees or packages).
   - Picked items can then be created into a package (`pick item` -> `create package`, frequency varies) or paid for if the order has been fully processed (`pay order`, frequency varies).

4. **Employees**
   - Employees pick items from inventory (`pick item`) and create packages (`create package`), with some loops in their process (e.g., `pick item` -> `item out of stock` -> `reorder item` -> `pick item`).
   - They also handle sending packages (`send package`) and confirming orders (`confirm order`).

5. **Packages**
   - Packages are created from picked items (`create package`), sent (`send package`), and delivered (`package delivered`).
   - There's a direct relationship between creating, sending, and delivering packages (`create package` -> `send package` -> `package delivered`).

6. **General Flow**
   - The overall process starts with customers placing orders.
   - Once confirmed, items are picked from inventory by employees.
   - Picked items are then created into packages, which are sent out for delivery.
   - After the order is paid and all items have been picked, the package can be delivered to the customer.

Here's a simplified visual representation of the process:

```
Customers
  |
place order -> confirm order
  |
Orders
  |
confirm order -> pick item (Items/Products)
  |
Items/Products
  |
pick item -> create package (Packages)
  |
Packages
  |
create package -> send package -> package delivered
  |
Employees
  |
* Various loops and additional events based on object type
```

The durations provided in the graph indicate the average time taken for each transition, while frequencies show how often these transitions occur. The number of objects involved in each transition is also given, providing insights into parallel processing or batch sizes.
