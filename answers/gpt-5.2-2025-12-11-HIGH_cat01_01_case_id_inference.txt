### Inferred case groupings (case IDs reconstructed)

The events cleanly separate into **three distinct patient journeys**, identifiable by the consistent combination of **patient_age + patient_gender + department trajectory + plausible activity order**.

---

## Case 1 — ER visit: 45-year-old male (left leg injury  X-ray  fracture diagnosis  discharge)
**Patient attributes:** age 45, gender M (mostly ER + Radiology)

**Events (by line number):** **1  4  7  12  15**

- **1** Register patient (ER, 45M)
- **4** Initial triage (ER, 45M)
- **7** X-ray imaging (Radiology, 45M, left_leg) — fits an ER injury pathway
- **12** Doctor consultation (ER, 45M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- **15** Patient discharged (ER, 45M, followup=outpatient_clinic)

**Why this grouping is strong:** consistent demographics, coherent ER workflow, and the radiology step logically connects triage to diagnosis.

## Case 2 — ER visit: 62-year-old female (triage  labs  diagnosis  prescription  discharge)
**Patient attributes:** age 62, gender F (ER + Laboratory)

**Events (by line number):** **2  5  8  10  11  14  17**

- **2** Register patient (ER, 62F)
- **5** Initial triage (ER, 62F, triage_code=2)
- **8** Lab test requested (ER, 62F, blood_panel)
- **10** Lab test completed (Laboratory, 62F)
- **11** Doctor consultation (ER, 62F, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- **14** Prescription created (ER, 62F, medication=antibiotics)
- **17** Patient discharged (ER, 62F, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

**Why this grouping is strong:** classic lab-driven ER pathway; timestamps and departments line up perfectly (request  completion  consult  prescription  discharge).

---

## Case 3 — Scheduled Surgery: 28-year-old male (consult  prep  procedure  recovery  discharge)
**Patient attributes:** age 28, gender M (Surgery pathway end-to-end)

**Events (by line number):** **3  6  9  13  16  18**

- **3** Register patient (Surgery, 28M)
- **6** Doctor consultation (Surgery, 28M, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
- **9** Surgery preparation (Surgery, 28M, general_anesthesia)
- **13** Surgery performed (Surgery, 28M, procedure=arthroscopy)
- **16** Recovery room (Surgery, 28M, condition=stable)
- **18** Patient discharged (Surgery, 28M, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

**Why this grouping is strong:** self-contained surgical flow with correct ordering and consistent department/resource context.

# Summary table

| Inferred Case ID | Patient (age/gender) | Journey Type | Event lines |
|---|---|---|---|
| Case 1 | 45M | ER injury + X-ray + discharge | **1, 4, 7, 12, 15** |
| Case 2 | 62F | ER infection + labs + antibiotics + discharge | **2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17** |
| Case 3 | 28M | Scheduled surgery + recovery + discharge | **3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18** |

These groupings are essentially unambiguous because each case has a unique demographic signature (45M, 62F, 28M) and a coherent department/activity progression that doesn’t cross over with the others.
