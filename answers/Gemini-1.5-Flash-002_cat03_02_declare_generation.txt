This model assumes a simple Purchase-to-Pay process with the following activities:

* **Order:**  The order is placed.
* **Receive Goods:** The goods are received.
* **Invoice Received:** The invoice is received.
* **Payment Sent:** The payment is sent.

The model enforces a sequential flow: Order -> Receive Goods -> Invoice Received -> Payment Sent.  The `chainresponse` and `chainsuccession` constraints reflect this direct-follows relationship.  The `response` and `precedence` constraints also capture the dependencies, but without the strict "directly follows" requirement.  `responded_existence` ensures that if an activity occurs, the subsequent activity in the chain also occurs.  The `init` constraint specifies that the process begins with an 'Order'.  All activities are set to exist.  Other constraints are left empty as they aren't necessary for this basic model.  Remember that support and confidence are set to 1.0, which is a simplification and would need adjustments based on real-world data analysis.
