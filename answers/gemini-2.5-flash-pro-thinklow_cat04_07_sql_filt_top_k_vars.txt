Of course. Here is a DuckDB SQL query that solves the problem, along with a detailed explanation of its components.

### Final DuckDB SQL Query

This query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into logical, sequential steps. We will set **K = 5** for this example.

```sql
-- Set the value for K, the number of top variants to select.
-- Let's use 5 as an example.
SET k = 5;

-- The main query to filter the event log based on the top K variants.
WITH
  -- Step 1 & 2 Part 1: Determine the activity sequence (variant) for each case.
  -- We use the list() aggregate function, which is ideal for creating an ordered
  -- array representation of the variant.
  CaseVariants AS (
    SELECT
      case_id,
      list(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM
      event_log
    GROUP BY
      case_id
  ),

  -- Step 2 Part 2 & Step 3: Count cases per variant and identify the top K variants.
  -- First, we count the occurrences of each unique variant.
  -- Then, we order by that count in descending order and take the top K.
  TopKVariants AS (
    SELECT
      variant
    FROM
      CaseVariants
    GROUP BY
      variant
    ORDER BY
      COUNT(case_id) DESC
    LIMIT (SELECT current_setting('k'))
  )

-- Step 4: Return all original events for cases that belong to the top K variants.
-- We join the original event_log with our CaseVariants CTE to find the variant
-- for each case. Then, we use an INNER JOIN with TopKVariants to filter for
-- only those cases whose variant is in the top K list.
SELECT
  log.*
FROM
  event_log AS log
  JOIN CaseVariants AS cv ON log.case_id = cv.case_id
  JOIN TopKVariants AS tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant
ORDER BY
  log.case_id,
  log.timestamp;

```

### Breakdown and Explanation

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the query works:

1.  **`SET k = 5;`**
    *   This is a DuckDB-specific convenience to set a session variable. This makes it easy to change the value of `K` without modifying the core logic of the query. The `current_setting('k')` function is used later to retrieve this value.

2.  **CTE 1: `CaseVariants`**
    *   **Purpose:** To determine the process variant for each `case_id`.
    *   **Method:**
        *   `GROUP BY case_id`: This groups all events belonging to a single process instance.
        *   `list(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant`: This is the core of the variant discovery. For each `case_id` group, it creates an ordered list (an array) of the `activity` values. The `ORDER BY timestamp` clause inside the aggregate function is crucial, as it ensures the sequence is correct.
    *   **Result:** A temporary table with two columns: `case_id` and `variant` (where `variant` is a list like `['Activity A', 'Activity B', 'Activity C']`).

3.  **CTE 2: `TopKVariants`**
    *   **Purpose:** To identify the `K` most frequent process variants.
    *   **Method:**
        *   `FROM CaseVariants`: It uses the result from the previous step.
        *   `GROUP BY variant`: It groups all cases that have the exact same activity sequence.
        *   `ORDER BY COUNT(case_id) DESC`: It counts how many cases fall into each variant group and sorts the variants from most frequent to least frequent.
        *   `LIMIT (SELECT current_setting('k'))`: It selects only the top `K` rows from the sorted result, giving us the most common variants.
    *   **Result:** A temporary table containing a single column, `variant`, which lists the top K most frequent activity sequences.

4.  **Final `SELECT` Statement**
    *   **Purpose:** To filter the original `event_log` and retrieve only the events belonging to cases that follow one of the top K variants.
    *   **Method:**
        *   `FROM event_log AS log`: Starts with the complete, original data.
        *   `JOIN CaseVariants AS cv ON log.case_id = cv.case_id`: This join attaches the calculated `variant` (activity list) to each event in the log based on its `case_id`.
        *   `JOIN TopKVariants AS tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant`: This is the final filtering step. It performs an `INNER JOIN`, which means it only keeps rows where the `variant` from `CaseVariants` exists in the `TopKVariants` list. This effectively discards all events from cases that do not match one of the top K variants.
        *   `ORDER BY log.case_id, log.timestamp`: This optional final sort organizes the output nicely, making it easy to inspect the resulting traces.

### Sample Data Setup

To test this query, you can create and populate a sample `event_log` table in DuckDB as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_log (
    case_id VARCHAR,
    activity VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO event_log VALUES
  -- Variant 1 (A -> B -> C): 3 cases
  ('case_1', 'Activity A', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
  ('case_1', 'Activity B', '2023-01-01 10:05:00'),
  ('case_1', 'Activity C', '2023-01-01 10:10:00'),
  ('case_2', 'Activity A', '2023-01-02 11:00:00'),
  ('case_2', 'Activity B', '2023-01-02 11:05:00'),
  ('case_2', 'Activity C', '2023-01-02 11:10:00'),
  ('case_5', 'Activity A', '2023-01-05 09:00:00'),
  ('case_5', 'Activity B', '2023-01-05 09:05:00'),
  ('case_5', 'Activity C', '2023-01-05 09:10:00'),

  -- Variant 2 (A -> C): 2 cases
  ('case_3', 'Activity A', '2023-01-03 12:00:00'),
  ('case_3', 'Activity C', '2023-01-03 12:05:00'),
  ('case_6', 'Activity A', '2023-01-06 14:00:00'),
  ('case_6', 'Activity C', '2023-01-06 14:05:00'),

  -- Variant 3 (A -> B -> D): 1 case (will be excluded if K=2)
  ('case_4', 'Activity A', '2023-01-04 13:00:00'),
  ('case_4', 'Activity B', '2023-01-04 13:05:00'),
  ('case_4', 'Activity D', '2023-01-04 13:10:00');
```

If you run the main query with `SET k = 2;` against this data, it will correctly identify `['A', 'B', 'C']` and `['A', 'C']` as the top 2 variants and return all the original events for `case_1`, `case_2`, `case_5`, `case_3`, and `case_6`, while excluding all events for `case_4`.
