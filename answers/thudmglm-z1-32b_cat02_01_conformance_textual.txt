**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

To identify deviations from the normative process, we analyze each case against the defined rules, resolving ambiguities as follows:
- **Strict sequence adherence**: Activities must follow the prescribed order (e.g., "Authorize payment" must come before "Package items").
- **Cancellation implications**: After "Cancel order," no fulfillment activities (e.g., "Ship order") are permitted.
- **Final step requirement**: "Close order" must always be the last activity.

### **Analysis of Each Case:**

#### **Case 1**  
**Sequence**: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package  Ship  Close  
**Violation**: **None**  
- Follows the exact normative path for sufficient inventory.  
- All post-"Check inventory" activities (Authorize, Package, Ship) are in the correct order.  
- "Close order" is the final step.

#### **Case 2**  
**Sequence**: Receive  Check inventory  Package  Authorize payment  Ship  Close  
**Violation**: **Out-of-order activities ("Package items" before "Authorize payment")**  
- **Rule broken**: "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items" (as per the description: *“Package items” should only occur after authorization*).  
- **Ambiguity resolution**: The process explicitly states that payment authorization is required *before* packaging.  
- **Impact**: Funding is authorized later than inventory confirmation, violating logical workflow.

#### **Case 3**  
**Sequence**: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel  Ship  Close  
**Violations**:  
1. **Cancel order" after "Authorize payment" (incompatible paths)**  
2. **"Ship order" after cancellation**  
- **Rule broken**:  
  1. If "Authorize payment" occurs (implying sufficient inventory), the process cannot bifurcate to "Cancel order." Cancellation is only valid *after* "Check inventory" (e.g., insufficient stock).  
  2. "Ship order" is explicitly prohibited after cancellation (the description states: *“proceeding to fulfillment activities after cancellation would be illogical*").  
- **Impact**: Contradicts the business logic by canceling an order already approved for payment and then shipping it redundantly.

#### **Case 4**  
**Sequence**: Receive  Check inventory  Cancel  Close  
**Violation**: **None**  
- Follows the normative path for insufficient inventory.  
- No fulfillment activities occur after cancellation.  
- "Close order" is the final step.  

---

#### **Case 5**  
**Sequence**: Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship  Close  
**Violation**: **Missing "Package items"**  
- **Rule broken**: "Ship order" must follow "Package items" (description states: *“items must be prepared before they can be shipped*").  
- **Ambiguity resolution**: Skipping packaging violates the physical/logistical requirement to prepare items prior to shipment.  
- **Impact**: Orders are shipped without prior packaging, risking fulfillment errors.

### **Summary of Violations**  
| Case | Violation | Rule(s) Broken |  
|------|-----------|----------------|  
| 2    | Package  Authorize payment | "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items." |  
| 3    | Authorize payment  Cancel, Cancel  Ship | 1. Cancellation is invalid after payment authorization. <br>2. "Ship order" cannot follow cancellation. |  
| 5    | Authorize payment  Ship (missing Package) | "Package items" is required between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." |  

**Non-violating Cases**:  
- **Case 1** and **Case 4** strictly adhere to the normative process.  

This analysis resolves ambiguities by prioritizing the explicit sequence constraints and logical dependencies (e.g., payment before packaging, cancellation blocking fulfillment).
