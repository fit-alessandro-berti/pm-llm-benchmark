The process described by this data is a multi-stage approval workflow for declarations or requests within an organization. The main entities involved are EMPLOYEE, PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, and SUPERVISOR.

Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission**: An employee submits a declaration or request, which can be approved, rejected, or require further approval.

2. **Intermediate Approvals**: Depending on the organization's rules, the submission may need to be pre-approved by a pre-approver, administratively approved by an administration team, or approved by the budget owner.

3. **Final Approval/Rejection**: After potentially passing through multiple approvers, the declaration or request reaches the supervisor for final approval or rejection.

4. **Request Payment & Payment Handling**: If the request is approved, a payment may need to be requested and processed. This can involve additional validation steps, resulting in either successful payment handling or further rejections.

Throughout this process, various performance metrics are captured, such as frequency (how often an event occurs), performance (measured in terms of time or other units relevant to the process).
