Below is a compact “check-list” that you can use when reviewing the model with process owners, data engineers and auditors.  
It is organised in three layers:

1. What is structurally odd in the POWL model (the anomalies)  
2. Plausible business / technical reasons why the model ended up like this (hypotheses)  
3. How you can confront these hypotheses with facts that are already stored in the
   PostgreSQL database (SQL sketches you can run or adapt).


1. Anomalies that are visible in the POWL model

A1. Evaluate/Approve loop  
• LOOP(E,P) allows an arbitrary number of repetitions and in any order:  
  E  P  E  …  (exit) – even “Approve” before the very first “Evaluate”.

A2. Optional customer notification  
• XOR(N, ) means that “Notify Customer” (N) can be silently skipped.

A3. Weak ordering before closing the claim  
• Edge A  C plus the missing edge xor  C means “Close Claim” (C) can legally happen:  
  – straight after “Assign Adjuster”, without any Evaluate / Approve / Notify, or  
  – in parallel with those activities.

A4. Missing resource constraints  
• The model never checks that the same adjuster (resource) stays with the claim, or
  that an adjuster with the correct specialisation is used.


2. Why could these anomalies exist?  (Hypotheses)

H1. Incremental rule changes  
• Business first added re-evaluation loops for disputed claims but never tightened
  the exit conditions, so early “Approve” is still syntactically allowed.

H2. Miscommunication between departments  
• IT interpreted “customer may already be aware” as “notification can be skipped”
  without asking Compliance, hence the XOR.

H3. Technical workaround / system limitation  
• Some legacy front-end closes the claim automatically when the payout file is
  generated, which can precede the official “Approve” event.

H4. Modeller convenience  
• Designer used sparse partial orders to avoid drawing many edges; the unintended
  side-effect was to leave C insufficiently constrained.


3. Verifying the hypotheses on the event data

(Feel free to copy-paste and tweak.  
PK/FK indexes on claim_events.claim_id and claim_events.timestamp are advisable.)

-- 3.1  Claims closed BEFORE their first evaluation  --------------------------
SELECT c.claim_id,
       MIN(ce_eval.timestamp) AS first_evaluate,
       ce_close.timestamp      AS close_time
FROM   claims c
JOIN   claim_events ce_close
           ON ce_close.claim_id = c.claim_id
          AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
LEFT  JOIN claim_events ce_eval
           ON ce_eval.claim_id = c.claim_id
          AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
GROUP  BY c.claim_id, ce_close.timestamp
HAVING ce_eval.event_id IS NULL            -- never evaluated at all
    OR  MIN(ce_eval.timestamp) > ce_close.timestamp;  -- evaluated afterwards

-- 3.2  Approvals without any evaluation beforehand ---------------------------
SELECT claim_id
FROM   claim_events
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END)
     < MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END);  -- P earlier than E

-- 3.3  Multiple approvals of the same claim (EP-loop materialised) -----------
SELECT claim_id,
       COUNT(*) AS approvals
FROM   claim_events
WHERE  activity = 'P'
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- 3.4  Evaluate  Approve  Evaluate pattern (evidence of the loop) ----------
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         activity,
         timestamp,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
  FROM   claim_events
  WHERE  activity IN ('E','P')
)
SELECT e1.claim_id
FROM   ranked e1
JOIN   ranked p
           ON p.claim_id = e1.claim_id
          AND p.rn       = e1.rn + 1
          AND e1.activity = 'E'
          AND p.activity  = 'P'
JOIN   ranked e2
           ON e2.claim_id = e1.claim_id
          AND e2.rn       = e1.rn + 2
          AND e2.activity = 'E';

-- 3.5  Closed claims with NO customer notification ---------------------------
SELECT claim_id
FROM   claim_events
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) >= 1  -- closed
   AND SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN 1 END)  = 0; -- never notified

-- 3.6  Adjuster specialisation mismatch (resource vs. claim_type) ------------
SELECT cl.claim_id,
       cl.claim_type,
       ce.resource AS adjuster_id,
       ad.specialization
FROM   claims cl
JOIN   claim_events ce
           ON ce.claim_id = cl.claim_id
          AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN   adjusters ad
           ON ad.adjuster_id = ce.resource::INTEGER
WHERE  (cl.claim_type LIKE '%home%' AND ad.specialization <> 'home')
    OR (cl.claim_type LIKE '%auto%' AND ad.specialization <> 'auto');

Interpretation of the result sets:

• Substantial results in query 3.1 or 3.2 would corroborate H3 (premature closing)  
• Frequent rows in 3.3 / 3.4 indicate that the Evaluate/Approve loop is actively used,
  supporting H1 (rule change)  
• High count from 3.5 suggests that the “skip notification” path is not only possible
  but common, strengthening H2 or H4  
• Mismatches from 3.6 point to missing resource constraints (A4) and potential
  compliance breaches.

Next steps:

1. Share the query findings with business owners for validation.  
2. If anomalies are confirmed, tighten the POWL model (add mandatory edges, guard
   conditions, or remove the silent branch).  
3. Implement database-level or application-level checks to prevent re-occurrence.
