Below is one valid solution that builds the POWL model for the complex digital service provisioning process:

--------------------------------------------------
# Begin code
--------------------------------------------------
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Initial steps: Service Request and mandatory Contract Setup
sr = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")
cs = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# Create a partial order for the initial mandatory sequence: SR followed by CS.
init_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[sr, cs])
init_po.order.add_edge(sr, cs)

# 2. Parallel preparation of the network environment: Datacenter Allocation and Access Control Initialization
da = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
aci = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
prep_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[da, aci])
# No ordering between da and aci since they are concurrent.

# 3. Looped configuration phase: Base Network Configuration and Debug & Reconfigure (loop)
bnc = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
dar = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
# Create a loop operator that denotes: execute BNC then optionally (if issues) execute D&R, after which back to BNC.
# The loop operator (Operator.LOOP) takes children in order: first the body activity then the repeated part.
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[bnc, dar])
# In a LOOP operator node, the semantics imply executing the first child then deciding whether to exit or to execute the second and then repeating.

# 4. Exclusive choice on Application Layer deployment: Containerized Deployment or Monolithic Deployment
cd = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
md = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
# Use XOR operator to choose one of the deployment strategies.
deploy_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cd, md])
  
# 5. Final tasks: Quality Assurance and Security Audit in partial order (they can be concurrent)
qa = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
sa = Transition(label="Security Audit")
final_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[qa, sa])
# No explicit order between qa and sa since they can be performed concurrently.

# 6. Final Go-Live Approval after QA and SA are completed
gla = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")
final_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[qa, sa, gla])
final_po.order.add_edge(qa, gla)
final_po.order.add_edge(sa, gla)

# 7. Assemble overall process using a partial order that links all parts of the process sequentially or in parallel as required.
# We create a root partial order whose children are the sub-models from steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[init_po, prep_po, loop_config, deploy_choice, final_po])

# Define overall ordering edges according to the scenario:
# (i) Contract Setup (end of init_po)  start of parallel preparation (prep_po)
root.order.add_edge(init_po, prep_po)

# (ii) The parallel environment preparation (prep_po) must complete before starting the looped configuration phase.
root.order.add_edge(prep_po, loop_config)

# (iii) Once the loop configuration phase (loop_config) is successful, then the exclusive deployment decision (deploy_choice) happens.
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, deploy_choice)

# (iv) After deployment, the final QA, SA and then Go-Live Approval (final_po) are executed.
root.order.add_edge(deploy_choice, final_po)

# The resulting model "root" is a POWL model representing the entire complex digital service provisioning process.
  
# For inspection, you can print or visualize the POWL structure.
print("Constructed POWL model for the digital service provisioning process:")
print(root)
  
--------------------------------------------------
# End code
--------------------------------------------------

Explanation of key modeling decisions:
1. The initial steps are modeled with a StrictPartialOrder (init_po) enforcing that "Service Request Verification" precedes "Contract Setup."
2. The network environment preparation tasks (DA and ACI) are created as concurrent nodes in prep_po.
3. The configuration phase is modeled with a LOOP operator (loop_config) that expresses that the Base Network Configuration (BNC) is followed by an optional Debug & Reconfigure (D&R) step repeated until stability.
4. The choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD) is modeled with an XOR operator (deploy_choice).
5. The final tasks (QA and SA) and the final Go-Live Approval (GLA) are modeled with a partial order (final_po) that requires GLA to start only when both QA and SA are finished.
6. The overall process is assembled in a root partial order that imposes the required inter-model execution order.

This code faithfully represents the scenario using POWL constructs as described.
