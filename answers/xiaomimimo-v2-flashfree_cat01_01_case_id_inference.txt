Based on the analysis of the event attributes (specifically `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and the logical sequence of medical activities), the events can be grouped into **3 distinct cases**.

Here is the breakdown of the cases:

### **Case 1: Male patient (45 years old) - ER / Leg Fracture**
This case involves a 45-year-old male who visited the ER, underwent imaging for a leg injury, received a diagnosis of a hairline fracture, and was discharged for outpatient follow-up.

*   **Event 1:** Register patient (Age 45, M, ER)
*   **Event 4:** Initial triage (Age 45, M, ER)
*   **Event 7:** X-ray imaging (Age 45, M, Radiology)
*   **Event 12:** Doctor consultation (Age 45, M, ER) - *Diagnosis: Hairline fracture*
*   **Event 15:** Patient discharged (Age 45, M, ER)

### **Case 2: Female patient (62 years old) - ER / Minor Infection**
This case involves a 62-year-old female who visited the ER, had lab tests done, received a diagnosis of a minor infection, was prescribed antibiotics, and discharged for pharmacy pickup.

*   **Event 2:** Register patient (Age 62, F, ER)
*   **Event 5:** Initial triage (Age 62, F, ER)
*   **Event 8:** Lab test requested (Age 62, F, ER)
*   **Event 10:** Lab test completed (Age 62, F, Laboratory)
*   **Event 11:** Doctor consultation (Age 62, F, ER) - *Diagnosis: Minor infection*
*   **Event 14:** Prescription created (Age 62, F, ER)
*   **Event 17:** Patient discharged (Age 62, F, ER)

### **Case 3: Male patient (28 years old) - Surgery / Knee Arthroscopy**
This case involves a 28-year-old male who visited Surgery for a scheduled knee procedure, underwent preparation and the operation, recovered in the recovery room, and was discharged for physiotherapy.

*   **Event 3:** Register patient (Age 28, M, Surgery)
*   **Event 6:** Doctor consultation (Age 28, M, Surgery) - *Reason: Scheduled knee surgery*
*   **Event 9:** Surgery preparation (Age 28, M, Surgery)
*   **Event 13:** Surgery performed (Age 28, M, Surgery)
*   **Event 16:** Recovery room (Age 28, M, Surgery)
*   **Event 18:** Patient discharged (Age 28, M, Surgery)

---

**Summary of Grouping Logic:**
*   **Patient Age/Gender** serves as the primary unique identifier in the absence of explicit Case IDs.
*   **Department and Activity** confirm the patient journey:
    *   The 45-year-old male splits time between **ER** and **Radiology** (X-ray).
    *   The 62-year-old female stays almost entirely within **ER** and **Laboratory** (Lab tests).
    *   The 28-year-old male stays within **Surgery** (Pre-op, Surgery, Recovery).
*   **Timestamps** confirm the strict chronological order within each grouping.
