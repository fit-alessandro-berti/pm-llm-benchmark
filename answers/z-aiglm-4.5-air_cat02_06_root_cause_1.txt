### Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Performance

#### 1. **Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**
To identify cases with delays, first calculate the total resolution time (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket") for each case:

| Case ID | Receive Timestamp     | Close Timestamp      | Total Duration      |
|---------|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00     | 2024-03-01 10:15     | 2 hours 15 min      |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05     | 2024-03-02 09:15     | **25 hours 10 min** |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10     | 2024-03-01 09:30     | 1 hour 20 min       |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20     | 2024-03-02 08:30     | **24 hours 10 min** |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25     | 2024-03-03 09:30     | **49 hours 5 min**  |

**Cases with delays:**  
- **Case 102 (25h 10m):** 11× longer than the median case (Case 101).  
- **Case 104 (24h 10m):** 10.6× longer than the median case.  
- **Case 105 (49h 5m):** 21.8× longer than the median case.  

**Baseline comparison:**  
- Median resolution time: **2 hours 15 min** (Cases 101–103).  
- Cases 102, 104, and 105 exceed this by **>22 hours** each, indicating significant bottlenecks.

#### 2. **Root Causes of Performance Issues**  
Key delays stem from **escalations**, **unnecessary gaps between activities**, and **overnight halts**.  

##### **Critical Factors:**  
**(A) Escalations to Level-2 Agents**  
- **Cases 102, 104, and 105** all required escalation, while Cases 101 and 103 resolved at Level-1.  
- **Impact:**  
  - Escalation adds manual handoff delays (e.g., Case 102: 2.5 hours post-assignment before escalation).  
  - Post-escalation investigation starts **days later** (e.g., Case 105: 28-hour gap after escalation).  

**(B) Long Gaps Between Activities**  
- **Pre-investigation delays:**  
  - Case 104: 3.5-hour gap after Level-1 assignment before investigation starts.  
- **Post-investigation delays:**  
  - **Overnight halts** dominate long cases:  
    - Case 102: 19-hour gap between investigation and resolution.  
    - Case 104: 19-hour gap between investigation and resolution.  
    - Case 105: 28-hour gap after escalation before Level-2 investigation.  

**(C) Inefficient Workflow Sequencing**  
- **Escalation triggers:**  
  - Case 105 escalated **50 minutes after investigation** (Level-1 agent delayed escalation).  
- **Resolution bottlenecks:**  
  - Resolution consistently starts **next morning** (e.g., 09:00 for Cases 102/104), implying no evening/weekend support.

#### 3. **How These Factors Increase Cycle Times**  
- **Escalations:**  
  - Handoffs cause **2–28 hour delays** (e.g., Case 105: 28-hour gap post-escalation).  
  - Level-2 queues may be backlogged, exacerbating delays.  
- **Overnight Halts:**  
  - Processes **pause at 17:00** and resume at 09:00, adding **15–16 hours/day** to resolution time.  
  - Example: Case 104’s 19-hour gap includes 15 overnight hours.  
- **Pre-investigation Delays:**  
  - Idle time before investigation (e.g., Case 104: 3.5 hours) inflates cycle times.  

---

#### 4. **Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks**  
**(A) Reduce Escalation Delays**  
- **Automate escalations:** Implement rules to auto-escalate after 1–2 hours if unresolved at Level-1.  
- **Dedicated Level-2 team:** Assign specialists to monitor escalations in real-time (avoid overnight waits).  

**(B) Eliminate Overnight Halts**  
- **24/7 support:** Introduce evening/weekend shifts for investigation/resolution.  
- **SLA enforcement:** Auto-escalate tickets stalled >2 hours.  

**(C) Streamline Workflow**  
- **Immediate investigation:** Mandate investigation starts within 30 minutes post-assignment.  
- **Progress tracking:** Alerts for tickets idle >1 hour (e.g., pre-investigation).  

**(D) Process Optimization**  
- **Triage efficiency:** Reduce triage time (e.g., Case 104 took 40 mins vs. 5 mins in Case 103).  
- **Root cause analysis:** Identify why Level-1 tickets (Cases 101/103) resolve faster—replicate best practices.

### **Summary**  
**Cases 102, 104, and 105** suffer from **escalation bottlenecks** and **overnight halts**, inflating resolution times by **22–49 hours**. By automating escalations, enforcing 24/7 support, and minimizing idle time, cycle times could align with the median (**~2 hours**). Implementing these changes would reduce delays by >90% for problematic cases.
