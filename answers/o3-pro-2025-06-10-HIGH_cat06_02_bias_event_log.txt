Where bias shows up

1. Attribute selection  
   • LocalResident (TRUE / FALSE)  
   • CommunityGroup (specific club name or “None”)  

   These two fields are not measures of credit-worthiness, yet they are fed into the scoring and decision rules.

2. ScoreAdjustment logic  
   • If CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club”  +10 points.  
   • No other group ever receives an uplift, and no negative adjustment is ever applied.

3. Implicit approval thresholds  
   Looking at the five completed cases:

   Local residents  
   - With darts-club uplift: C001 (710+10) Approved at 720  
   - Without uplift:        C002 (720)    Approved  
   - With uplift:           C004 (690+10) Approved at 700  

   Non-residents  
   - No uplift:             C003 (715)    Rejected  
   - No uplift:             C005 (740)    Approved  

   The pattern implies two different cut-offs:  
   • Residents need roughly 700–720.  
   • Non-residents need about 740.  
   • Club members get 10 “free” points that can move them from a reject to an accept range (C004).

Where and how the bias is operating

A. Geographic bias  
   The LocalResident flag appears to shift the acceptance threshold downward by ~20–40 points. Applicants who live outside the locality must compensate by having materially better credit metrics.

B. Affiliation (social-capital) bias  
   Membership in a single named community organization automatically yields +10 points, the only score adjustment observed. That uplift:  
   • Overrides purely risk-based scoring.  
   • Pushes borderline local applicants (e.g., C004) into the approval band.  
   • Is unavailable to everyone else—even other local residents—creating an unequal playing field.

Why this is unfair even when underlying credit quality is similar

1. Two people with the same preliminary score (e.g., 715) are treated differently purely because of residence (C003 vs. hypothetical local).  
2. Two local residents with the same score (e.g., 690) are treated differently depending on whether they belong to a specific club (C004 vs. hypothetical non-member).  
3. Community-group membership and local residency are likely correlated with protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status; using them as scoring factors risks disparate impact.  
4. Individuals who cannot join the favored club (newcomers, people with mobility issues, cultural or religious differences) are systematically disadvantaged despite identical financial risk.

Consequences

• Reduced access to credit for out-of-area or non-affiliated applicants.  
• Possible violation of fair-lending and anti-discrimination regulations.  
• Erosion of trust: the system looks objective but embeds social favoritism.  
• Self-reinforcing inequality: those already integrated into the dominant local network enjoy cheaper or more abundant credit, increasing their economic advantage.

Key take-aways

1. Bias points: the +10 Community uplift and the dual geographic thresholds.  
2. Favored groups: local residents, and especially members of “Highland Civic Darts Club.”  
3. Disfavored groups: non-residents and anyone without that specific community affiliation, even when their credit scores are equal or higher.
