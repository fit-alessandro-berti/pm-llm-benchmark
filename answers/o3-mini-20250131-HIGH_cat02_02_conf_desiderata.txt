Below is an analysis of the event log with respect to the strict (normative) rules and the softer (desiderata) recommendations.

---

## 1. Normative (Strict) Rules Violations

### **Case 1**
- **Status:** **No normative violations.**
- **Explanation:**  
  The process follows the required order:
  - **Application Received** → **Credit Check** → **Risk Assessment** → **Loan Decision (Approved)** → **Inform Applicant** → **Finalize Documentation** → **Close Case**
  
### **Case 2**
- **Status:** **Violates several normative rules.**
- **Violations & Explanations:**
  - **Ordering Violation:**  
    - **Risk Assessment** (at 08:20) was performed **before** the **Credit Check** (at 09:00), contrary to the rule that the credit check must precede the risk assessment.
  - **Decision-Related Violation:**  
    - The **Loan Decision** is *Rejected*, yet **Finalize Documentation** is performed afterward (at 10:00).  
      - **Normative Rule:** When the loan is rejected, documentation should **not** be finalized.
  - **Missing Required Step:**  
    - There is no **Inform Applicant** event following the loan decision.  
      - **Normative Rule:** The applicant must always be informed of the outcome immediately after the decision.
    
### **Case 3**
- **Status:** **No normative violations.**
- **Explanation:**  
  The recorded events follow the strict sequence:
  - **Application Received** → **Credit Check** → **Risk Assessment** → **Loan Decision (Approved)** → **Inform Applicant** → **Finalize Documentation** → **Close Case**
  - *(Note: Although some timing issues exist, they are not considered normative violations.)*

## 2. Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict) Deviations

These recommendations focus on the timeliness of certain activities and the inclusion of a follow-up step. Their violation does not break the process but indicates suboptimal performance.

### **Case 1**
- **Desiderata Deviation:**  
  - **Missing Follow-up Call:**  
    - **Recommendation:** It is encouraged to perform a follow-up call to the applicant before closing the case.  
    - **Observation:** No such call is recorded in the log.
- **Overall:** Apart from the follow-up call, the timing of the **Credit Check** (30 minutes after application) and **Inform Applicant** (2 hours after decision) meets the recommendations.

### **Case 2**
- **Desiderata Deviations:**  
  - **Missing Inform Applicant:**  
    - Although this is a **normative** violation, it also represents a failure to follow the recommended communication best practice.
  - **Missing Follow-up Call:**  
    - No record of a follow-up call is present.
- **Note:** Because Case 2 already breaks the strict rules, these additional issues further underscore suboptimal handling.

### **Case 3**
- **Desiderata Deviations:**  
  - **Delayed Credit Check:**  
    - **Recommendation:** The credit check should be completed within 24 hours of receiving the application.
    - **Observation:** The credit check was performed at **2024-01-14 10:00**, more than 24 hours after the **Application Received** event at **2024-01-12 09:00**.
  - **Delayed Inform Applicant:**  
    - **Recommendation:** The applicant should be informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
    - **Observation:** The **Loan Decision** was at **2024-01-14 12:00**, but **Inform Applicant** occurred at **2024-01-16 15:00**, exceeding the 48-hour guideline.
  - **Missing Follow-up Call:**  
    - No follow-up call is recorded, even though it is recommended.

## 3. Possible Interpretations or Justifications

While the normative rules must be strictly adhered to, the deviations from desiderata may sometimes be explainable by practical or operational factors. Here are some potential interpretations:

- **Case 1:**
  - *Follow-up Call:*  
    - The absence of a recorded follow-up call might be due to the call being made outside of the logging system or handled informally. It’s possible that the team prioritized the mandatory steps, with the follow-up intended as an informal check that wasn’t documented.
  
- **Case 2:**
  - *Ordering Error (Risk Assessment before Credit Check):*  
    - This could have been the result of a procedural error or a system logging anomaly. In some cases, teams might attempt to expedite risk evaluation when a credit report is delayed, though this deviates from the established process.
  - *Finalizing Documentation After Rejection:*  
    - It might have been an attempt to complete all administrative tasks regardless of the outcome, possibly for record-keeping or audit trail purposes, despite this contradicting the prescribed process.
  - *Missing Inform Applicant:*  
    - The omission could be due to an oversight or miscommunication between departments, although it is a critical step both normatively and for customer service.
    
- **Case 3:**
  - *Delayed Credit Check and Informing Applicant:*  
    - These delays may be attributed to external factors such as waiting for third-party credit reports, limited resource availability, or even delays due to non-working days (e.g., weekends or holidays).
  - *Missing Follow-up Call:*  
    - Similar to Case 1, the follow-up might have been conducted informally or planned separately but not logged.
    
These interpretations suggest that while the core sequence was maintained in Cases 1 and 3, operational pressures or external dependencies can lead to delays or omissions in recommended steps. In contrast, Case 2 shows clear deviations from the mandatory process, which likely require process corrections or further investigation.

**Summary:**
- **Normative Violations:**  
  - **Case 2** violates strict rules by performing the risk assessment before the credit check, finalizing documentation despite a rejected decision, and omitting the step to inform the applicant.
  
- **Desiderata Deviations:**  
  - **Case 1:** Missing the recommended follow-up call.
  - **Case 3:** Delays in both the credit check and the applicant notification, plus no follow-up call.
  - **Case 2:** Also misses recommended steps, but its primary issues are normative violations.

By addressing these deviations and investigating the reasons behind them, the process owners can improve both compliance with mandatory steps and adherence to best practices.
