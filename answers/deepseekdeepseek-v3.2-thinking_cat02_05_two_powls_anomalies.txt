<think>
We are given two POWL models for a Hire-to-Retire process. The standard process typically includes: posting a job ad, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding, adding to payroll, and closing the case. The expected order is generally sequential with some possible variations (e.g., screening before interviews, decision after interviews, onboarding after decision, payroll after onboarding, then close). However, there might be loops or conditional branches (e.g., maybe skip payroll? unlikely, but maybe conditional onboarding?).

Let's analyze each model step by step.

### Model 1 Analysis:
Model 1 is defined as a StrictPartialOrder with nodes: Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close.
Edges:
- Post -> Screen
- Screen -> Decide
- Screen -> Interview
- Decide -> Onboard
- Onboard -> Payroll
- Payroll -> Close

Interpretation: The partial order means that the edges define precedence constraints. So:
- Post must happen before Screen.
- Screen must happen before Decide.
- Screen must happen before Interview.
- Decide must happen before Onboard.
- Onboard must happen before Payroll.
- Payroll must happen before Close.

But note: There is no edge between Interview and Decide? The constraints are: Screen precedes both Decide and Interview. But there is no constraint between Interview and Decide. So Interview and Decide can happen in any order relative to each other, as long as both happen after Screen. However, typically, interviews happen before the hiring decision. So having Decide not necessarily after Interview is an anomaly. Also, note that Decide is before Onboard, which is good. But there is no edge from Interview to Onboard or Decide? So it's possible to make a hiring decision without conducting interviews? That seems odd. Also, there is no constraint that Interview must happen before Decide. So the model allows a flow where after screening, you could make the hiring decision immediately without interviews, or you could do interviews after the decision? That is problematic.

Additionally, there is no constraint that Interview must happen before Onboard? But since Decide is before Onboard, and Interview might be after Decide, it could be that interviews happen after the decision? That is clearly wrong.

Also, note that the model has no loops or choices. It is a partial order with some parallelism allowed. But the anomalies are mainly in the ordering.

So anomalies in Model 1:
1. The hiring decision can be made without conducting interviews (since no edge from Interview to Decide, and Screen -> Decide is there, so after Screen you can go directly to Decide).
2. Interviews might be conducted after the hiring decision (since no edge from Interview to Decide, and Decide -> Onboard, so you could do Decide, then Interview, then Onboard? But Onboard requires Decide before, but Interview could be done after Decide? Actually, there is no edge from Decide to Interview, so they are concurrent after Screen. So you could do: Post, Screen, then Decide, then Onboard, Payroll, Close, and never do Interview. Or you could do Interview after Decide, but before Onboard? Possibly, but since there is no edge, it's allowed. But also, there is no edge from Interview to Onboard, so Interview could even happen after Onboard? Possibly, but Onboard requires Decide before, and Payroll requires Onboard before, so if Interview happens after Onboard, it might be after Payroll? But there is no constraint preventing that. So Interview could be at any time after Screen, even after Close? No, because Close is last? Actually, there is an edge Payroll -> Close, so Close is after Payroll. But Interview is not constrained relative to Payroll or Close. So Interview could be done after Close? That seems very odd.

So Model 1 has severe anomalies: it allows the hiring decision to be made without interviews, and interviews might be conducted at an inappropriate time (even after onboarding or after closing the case). This violates the fundamental logic of hiring.

### Model 2 Analysis:
Model 2 is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close.
Edges:
- Post -> Screen
- Post -> Interview
- Interview -> Decide
- Decide -> loop_onboarding
- loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll
- xor_payroll -> Close

Also, loop_onboarding is defined as OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP, children [Onboard, skip]. So it's a loop: do Onboard, then either skip (exit) or go back to Onboard? Actually, the LOOP operator in POWL/process trees typically means: do the first child, then repeatedly choose between doing the second child and then the first child again, or exiting. So here, loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip). That means: execute Onboard, then either exit the loop, or execute skip and then go back to Onboard. But skip is a silent transition (tau), so effectively, after Onboard, you can either exit or go back to Onboard (since skip doesn't do anything). So it's a loop that can repeat Onboard multiple times. That might represent multiple onboarding steps? Possibly, but typically onboarding is done once per hire. However, maybe it could be repeated if there are multiple onboarding tasks? But the label is "Onboard_Employee", which is singular. So looping onboarding might be an anomaly: you might onboard the same employee multiple times? That seems odd. Alternatively, it could be for onboarding multiple employees? But the process is Hire-to-Retire for one employee? Usually, the process is per hire. So looping onboarding is unusual.

Next, xor_payroll is defined as OperatorPOWL with operator XOR, children [Payroll, skip]. So it's an exclusive choice: either do Payroll or skip (do nothing). So adding to payroll might be skipped. That could be an anomaly: typically, after hiring, you must add the employee to payroll. Skipping payroll would mean the employee doesn't get paid. That is a severe issue.

Now, look at the partial order edges:
- Post -> Screen
- Post -> Interview
So Post must happen before both Screen and Interview. But there is no edge between Screen and Interview. So Screen and Interview can happen in any order after Post, or even concurrently. Typically, screening happens before interviews. So having them unordered is a deviation: you could conduct interviews before screening? That might be inefficient but not necessarily a severe error. However, it's a deviation from good practice.
- Interview -> Decide: So Interview must happen before Decide. That's good.
- Decide -> loop_onboarding: So after decision, you go to onboarding loop. That's fine.
- loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll: After onboarding loop, you go to the payroll choice.
- xor_payroll -> Close: After payroll choice, you close.

Also, note: There is no edge from Screen to Decide. So you could potentially make a decision without screening? But since Post -> Screen and Post -> Interview, and Interview -> Decide, you must do Interview before Decide, and you must do Post before both. But do you have to do Screen? There is no edge from Screen to anything else except it is after Post. So Screen is not a prerequisite for Interview or Decide. So you could skip screening entirely? Actually, you must do Post, then you can do Interview and Decide without doing Screen? Because there is no constraint that forces Screen to happen before Interview or Decide. So you could have a trace: Post, Interview, Decide, ... without Screen. That is an anomaly: screening candidates is typically a necessary step before interviews. So Model 2 allows skipping screening.

Also, note that Screen and Interview are both after Post, but there is no constraint that Screen must happen before Interview. So you could do Interview before Screen, which is odd.

So anomalies in Model 2:
1. Screening can be skipped entirely (since no edge from Screen to any other activity except Post, and no requirement that Screen must be done before the process proceeds).
2. Screening and interviews can be performed in any order (they are concurrent after Post). Typically, screening comes first.
3. Onboarding can be repeated multiple times (loop). Possibly not a severe error but unusual.
4. Payroll addition can be skipped (XOR with skip). This is a severe anomaly because employees must be added to payroll to get paid.

Now, comparing both models, we need to decide which one more closely aligns with a normative version. The normative version should have:
- Post Job Ad
- Screen Candidates
- Conduct Interviews
- Make Hiring Decision
- Onboard Employee
- Add to Payroll
- Close Case

And the order should be essentially sequential: Post -> Screen -> Interview -> Decide -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close. There might be some variations: maybe multiple interviews, but that could be modeled as a loop on interviews, but here we have simple activities. Also, screening might be done in parallel with posting? Unlikely. So the normative order is sequential.

Model 1 has the severe issue that interviews are not required for the hiring decision, and interviews might happen after the decision or even after onboarding. Model 2 has the severe issue that screening can be skipped and payroll can be skipped. However, Model 2 at least requires interviews before the decision (Interview -> Decide). Also, Model 2 has a loop on onboarding and a skip on payroll, which are deviations.

Which is worse? Skipping payroll is a severe business error because it leads to employees not being paid. Skipping interviews is also severe because hiring decisions should be based on interviews. However, in Model 1, interviews might not happen at all, or happen at wrong times. In Model 1, there is no requirement that interviews happen before the decision. So both have severe issues.

But maybe we can consider the possibility of conditional skipping: In real processes, sometimes payroll might not be added if the hiring decision is to not hire? But the process is "Hire-to-Retire", so it assumes a hire happens. So after onboarding, payroll should be added. Skipping payroll is not acceptable. In Model 1, payroll is mandatory (since it's in the sequence). In Model 2, payroll can be skipped.

Also, in Model 1, screening is mandatory (since there is an edge from Post to Screen, and Screen to Decide, so you must do Screen before Decide). In Model 2, screening is not mandatory.

So Model 1 enforces screening and payroll, but does not enforce interviews before decision. Model 2 enforces interviews before decision, but does not enforce screening, and allows skipping payroll.

Which is more normative? Typically, both screening and interviews are important. Skipping either is bad. But maybe skipping screening is less severe than skipping interviews? Or maybe both are critical. However, in many hiring processes, screening is a preliminary step to select candidates for interviews, so skipping screening might lead to interviewing unqualified candidates, but skipping interviews entirely means hiring without any interview, which is worse. But in Model 1, you can hire without interviews, which is very bad. In Model 2, you can skip screening but still have interviews, so at least there is some evaluation.

Also, Model 2 has the anomaly that interviews can happen before screening, which is odd but not catastrophic.

Moreover, Model 2 has a loop on onboarding. That might be interpreted as onboarding might involve multiple tasks, so it could be acceptable if onboarding is a subprocess. But the label suggests a single activity, so looping might be an error.

Considering the overall, maybe Model 2 is closer to normative because it at least requires interviews before the hiring decision. However, the payroll skip is severe. But in Model 1, payroll is mandatory, which is good. So we need to weigh the anomalies.

Let's list the anomalies by severity:

Model 1:
- High: Hiring decision can be made without conducting interviews (Interview not required before Decide).
- High: Interviews can occur after the hiring decision, even after onboarding or closing, which is illogical.
- Medium: No explicit order between Interview and Decide, but since Screen precedes both, they can be concurrent or in any order. The high severity comes from the possibility of Decide before Interview.

Model 2:
- High: Payroll addition can be skipped (XOR with skip). This could lead to employees not being paid.
- High: Screening can be skipped entirely (no dependency forcing it to be done). However, screening might be considered less critical than interviews? But still, skipping screening is a process deviation.
- Medium: Screening and interviews can be in any order (possible to interview before screening).
- Low/Medium: Onboarding can be repeated (loop). This might be a design choice if onboarding involves multiple steps, but if it's a single activity, repeating it might be unnecessary.

Normative process should have: Screening before Interviews, Interviews before Decision, Onboarding once, Payroll mandatory.

Neither model is perfect. But Model 1 ensures Screening and Payroll are mandatory, but fails to enforce Interviews before Decision. Model 2 enforces Interviews before Decision, but fails to enforce Screening and Payroll.

Perhaps we can argue that Model 1's anomaly is more severe because hiring without interviews is a major compliance/quality issue, whereas skipping payroll might be caught later (but still severe). However, in practice, both are serious.

But note: In Model 1, the partial order allows Interview to never happen. So it's possible to have a trace: Post, Screen, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close. That is hiring without interviews. In Model 2, it's possible to have a trace: Post, Interview, Decide, Onboard (maybe loop), skip Payroll, Close. That is hiring without screening and without payroll. Also, in Model 2, you must do Interview because of the edge Interview -> Decide, so Interview is mandatory? Actually, check: There is an edge from Post to Interview, and Interview -> Decide. So to reach Decide, you must have done Interview because Decide depends on Interview? In a partial order, if there is an edge Interview -> Decide, then Decide cannot happen before Interview. But does it force Interview to happen? If there is no other path to Decide? The process starts with Post, then you have Screen and Interview as concurrent after Post. But to proceed to Decide, you need to have done Interview because of the edge Interview -> Decide. So Interview is a prerequisite for Decide. So in Model 2, Interview is mandatory. Similarly, to get to Close, you need to go through xor_payroll, which requires loop_onboarding before, which requires Decide before, which requires Interview before. So Interview is indeed mandatory. However, Screen is not mandatory because there is no edge from Screen to any other node except Post. So you could skip Screen entirely and still complete the process. So Model 2 requires Interview but not Screen.

In Model 1, Interview is not mandatory because there is no edge from Interview to anything. So you could skip Interview entirely.

So both models have one mandatory and one optional step: Model 1 makes Screen mandatory but Interview optional; Model 2 makes Interview mandatory but Screen optional.

Which is worse? Typically, both screening and interviews are important, but interviews are usually more critical for the hiring decision. However, skipping screening might lead to inefficiency but not necessarily a bad hire if interviews are thorough. Skipping interviews entirely is definitely a bad practice. So Model 1's anomaly (skipping interviews) might be more severe than Model 2's anomaly (skipping screening). But Model 2 also allows skipping payroll, which is very severe.

Maybe we need to consider the overall process integrity. The normative process likely requires all steps. But if we have to choose which model is closer, we might look at the ordering of steps that are present.

In Model 1, the ordering is partially correct: Post before Screen, Screen before Decide (but not necessarily before Interview), Decide before Onboard, Onboard before Payroll, Payroll before Close. The main flaw is the missing order between Interview and Decide, and Interview not being required.

In Model 2, the ordering: Post before Screen and Interview (but no order between them), Interview before Decide, Decide before Onboard loop, Onboard loop before Payroll choice, Payroll choice before Close. The flaws: no order between Screen and Interview, Screen not required, Payroll can be skipped, Onboard can be repeated.

If we could fix one anomaly in each, Model 1 would need an edge from Interview to Decide (or Screen to Interview and Interview to Decide) to enforce interviews before decision. Model 2 would need to make Screen mandatory (e.g., by adding an edge from Screen to Interview or to Decide) and remove the skip option from payroll (make it mandatory) and possibly remove the loop on onboarding or clarify it.

Given that, perhaps Model 2 is closer because it at least has the correct order between Interview and Decide, and it has a clear sequence from Decide to Onboard to Payroll to Close (though with loops and skips). But the skip on payroll is a major issue.

Maybe we can interpret the skip in payroll as: maybe sometimes payroll is not needed? But in Hire-to-Retire, it is needed. So that is a severe deviation.

Let's think about the intended normative model. A standard hiring process would likely have:
- Post Job Ad
- Screen Candidates (mandatory)
- Conduct Interviews (mandatory)
- Make Hiring Decision (mandatory)
- Onboard Employee (mandatory)
- Add to Payroll (mandatory)
- Close Case (mandatory)

And the order: sequential: Post -> Screen -> Interview -> Decide -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close.

Comparing:
Model 1: Missing order between Interview and Decide, and Interview not mandatory.
Model 2: Missing order between Screen and Interview, Screen not mandatory, Payroll not mandatory, Onboard loop.

Both have multiple issues. But maybe Model 1's issue is more fundamental because it allows hiring without interviews, which is a critical flaw. Model 2 at least requires interviews. However, Model 2 allows skipping payroll, which is also critical. But in some contexts, payroll might be handled separately, but still, it's part of the process.

Perhaps we can argue that Model 2 is closer because it has the correct order for Interview and Decide, and it has a partial order that could be fixed by adding an edge from Screen to Interview and making payroll mandatory. Model 1 would require adding an edge from Interview to Decide and maybe making Interview mandatory.

But note: In Model 1, Interview is a node but with no incoming edges except from Screen? Actually, there is an edge from Screen to Interview. So Interview has an incoming edge from Screen, so it cannot happen before Screen. But it has no outgoing edges, so it doesn't force anything after it. So Interview is not mandatory for the process to continue because you can go from Screen to Decide without Interview. However, Interview is still in the model, so it might be optional. In Model 2, Interview has an incoming edge from Post and an outgoing edge to Decide, so it is mandatory because to reach Decide, you must go through Interview. So Interview is mandatory in Model 2.

Thus, Model 2 ensures interviews are conducted, which is a key control point. Model 1 does not.

Considering that, and the fact that screening, while important, might be less critical than interviews, Model 2 might be closer to normative. However, the payroll skip is a big problem. But maybe in some processes, payroll is added only if the employee is hired, but here the decision is made, so hire is assumed. So payroll should be mandatory.

Maybe we can see if there is any justification for skipping payroll? Possibly if the hiring decision is to not hire? But the process is Hire-to-Retire, so it assumes a hire. The activity "Onboard_Employee" suggests the employee is hired. So after onboarding, payroll should be added. So skipping payroll is an error.

In Model 1, payroll is mandatory.

So we have a trade-off: Model 1 ensures payroll is done, but allows hiring without interviews. Model 2 ensures interviews are done, but allows skipping payroll.

Which is worse? Hiring without interviews could lead to hiring unqualified people, which is a major business risk. Skipping payroll could lead to compliance issues and employee dissatisfaction. Both are severe.

But perhaps in a well-controlled process, interviews are a key gate, and skipping them is more likely to be caught? Not necessarily.

Maybe we can look at the overall structure: Model 1 has a more straightforward sequential flow except for the Interview/Decide concurrency. Model 2 has additional constructs like loop and XOR, which might be intended to handle variations, but in this case, they are misapplied.

Given the task, we need to decide which more closely aligns. I lean towards Model 2 because it enforces interviews before decision, which is a critical dependency. The screening order can be fixed by adding an edge from Screen to Interview. The payroll skip can be fixed by removing the skip option. The onboarding loop might be acceptable if onboarding is a subprocess with multiple tasks. So Model 2 is more easily fixable to a normative model by making Screen mandatory and removing the skip on payroll. Model 1 would require adding a dependency from Interview to Decide and possibly making Interview mandatory.

But in Model 1, to make Interview mandatory, you would need to add an edge from Interview to something, or make Decide require Interview. Currently, Decide only requires Screen. So fixing Model 1 would require restructuring.

Thus, I think Model 2 is closer to normative because it already has the correct order between Interview and Decide, and the other anomalies are more about optionality and loops.

But let's see the edges in Model 2: Post -> Screen and Post -> Interview. So Screen and Interview are both directly after Post, but no order between them. In a normative model, Screen should be before Interview. So that's a deviation. In Model 1, Screen is before Interview (edge Screen -> Interview). So Model 1 has the correct order between Screen and Interview. That's a point for Model 1.

So Model 1 has: Screen -> Interview (good), but missing Interview -> Decide (bad).
Model 2 has: Post -> Interview and Post -> Screen, but no Screen -> Interview (bad), but has Interview -> Decide (good).

So both have one correct and one incorrect ordering regarding Screening and Interviewing.

But Model 1 also allows Decide without Interview, which is worse than having Screening and Interview unordered? Possibly.

Maybe we can combine: In Model 1, since Screen -> Interview, Interview cannot happen before Screen. That's good. But Interview is not required for Decide. In Model 2, Interview is required for Decide, but Interview can happen before Screening, which is odd.

Which is more normative? Typically, screening must happen before interviews. So having interviews before screening is not logical. In Model 2, you could interview candidates before screening them, which might mean you interview everyone who applied without screening. That could be inefficient but not necessarily a compliance issue if you interview all applicants. But in many processes, screening reduces the pool. So it's a deviation from good practice.

In Model 1, you could screen and then decide without interviewing, which is a compliance issue if interviews are required.

So both are bad, but maybe deciding without interviews is worse than interviewing without screening.

I think the most critical thing is that the hiring decision should be based on interviews. So Model 2 ensures that interviews happen before the decision. Therefore, Model 2 is better in that regard.

Also, note that in Model 1, there is no constraint that Interview must happen at all. So you could completely skip interviews. In Model 2, Interview must happen because of the edge to Decide.

So I'll go with Model 2 as more closely aligning, but with the caveat that it still has anomalies.

Now, for the answer, we need to:
1. Analyze both models.
2. Identify anomalies in each.
3. Decide which is closer to normative and justify.

Let's structure the answer.

**Step 1: Analysis of Model 1:**
- Partial order with edges as given.
- Allows: Post -> Screen -> Decide -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close without Interview.
- Also allows Interview to occur concurrently with Decide or even after Onboard/Payroll/Close.
- Screening is mandatory and precedes Interview (good).
- Payroll is mandatory (good).
- No loops or choices, so all activities are executed exactly once except Interview which might be skipped.

**Step 2: Analysis of Model 2:**
- Partial order with edges as given, plus LOOP and XOR operators.
- Screening is not mandatory (can be skipped).
- Screening and Interview can be in any order (Interview may occur before Screening).
- Interview is mandatory and must precede Decide (good).
- Onboarding can be repeated (loop).
- Payroll can be skipped (XOR with skip) (bad).
- All activities except Screening are mandatory or conditionally mandatory.

**Step 3: Comparison and decision:**
Normative process: Sequential order with all activities mandatory: Post -> Screen -> Interview -> Decide -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close.

Model 1 violates the necessity of Interview before Decide and allows Interview to be omitted entirely. Model 2 violates the necessity of Screening and the order between Screen and Interview, and allows Payroll to be skipped. However, Model 2 ensures Interview before Decide, which is a critical control point. Additionally, the anomalies in Model 2 (skip payroll, unordered Screen/Interview) can be seen as deviations that might be acceptable in some variants (e.g., screening might be integrated with interviews, payroll might be handled elsewhere), but skipping interviews is never acceptable. Therefore, Model 2 is closer to normative because it enforces the key dependency that interviews must precede the hiring decision.

But wait, is skipping payroll ever acceptable? In a hiring process, if you hire someone, you must add them to payroll. So that is a severe flaw. However, in some processes, adding to payroll might be part of onboarding, but here it's separate. So it's a clear anomaly.

Perhaps we can argue that Model 1 is closer because it has the correct order for Screen and Interview, and payroll is mandatory. The missing edge from Interview to Decide is a serious flaw, but maybe we can interpret the partial order as allowing concurrency, but in practice, the process might require both Screen and Interview to finish before Decide? However, the model does not enforce that. In a partial order, if there is no path between two nodes, they can be in any order. So it's not just concurrency; it's that Decide can happen without Interview.

Given that, I think both are flawed, but Model 2's flaw of skipping payroll is as severe as skipping interviews. However, Model 2 also has the loop on onboarding, which might be a design choice for multiple onboarding tasks, so maybe not an anomaly.

Let's check the definitions: In the prompt, the Hire-to-Retire process typically includes those activities. So all should be present and in a logical order.

Maybe we can score each model based on how many normative constraints are satisfied.

Normative constraints:
1. Post first.
2. Screen after Post.
3. Interview after Screen.
4. Decide after Interview.
5. Onboard after Decide.
6. Payroll after Onboard.
7. Close after Payroll.
8. All activities are mandatory (no skips).
9. No unnecessary loops.

Model 1:
- 1: Post first: yes, Post has no incoming edges, and edges to Screen.
- 2: Screen after Post: yes, edge Post->Screen.
- 3: Interview after Screen: yes, edge Screen->Interview.
- 4: Decide after Interview: NO, no edge.
- 5: Onboard after Decide: yes, edge Decide->Onboard.
- 6: Payroll after Onboard: yes, edge Onboard->Payroll.
- 7: Close after Payroll: yes, edge Payroll->Close.
- 8: All mandatory: Interview is not mandatory (can be skipped), others are mandatory.
- 9: No unnecessary loops: no loops, so ok.

So violates constraints 4 and 8 partially (Interview not mandatory).

Model 2:
- 1: Post first: yes, Post has no incoming, edges to Screen and Interview.
- 2: Screen after Post: yes, edge Post->Screen.
- 3: Interview after Screen: NO, no edge, they are concurrent after Post.
- 4: Decide after Interview: yes, edge Interview->Decide.
- 5: Onboard after Decide: yes, edge Decide->loop_onboarding (which contains Onboard).
- 6: Payroll after Onboard: yes, edge loop_onboarding->xor_payroll, but Payroll is optional, so the order is there but Payroll might be skipped.
- 7: Close after Payroll: yes, edge xor_payroll->Close, but if Payroll is skipped, Close is after the skip.
- 8: All mandatory: Screening is not mandatory (can be skipped), Payroll is not mandatory (can be skipped). Onboard is mandatory but can be repeated (loop). So violations.
- 9: No unnecessary loops: has a loop on onboarding, which might be unnecessary.

So Model 2 violates constraints 3, 6 (since Payroll can be skipped, so not guaranteed after Onboard), 7 (if Payroll skipped, Close is after skip, but still after the XOR, so order is maintained but activity skipped), and 8 (Screen and Payroll not mandatory), and 9 (maybe).

Model 1 violates constraint 4 and 8 (Interview not mandatory). Constraint 4 is critical: Decide after Interview. So both violate critical constraints.

Maybe constraint 4 is more critical than constraint 3? Possibly. And Model 2 violates constraint 3 (Interview after Screen) but that is less critical than Decide after Interview? Actually, both are important, but if Interview is after Screen, it ensures screening happens first. But if Interview is before Screen, it's still possible to interview, then screen? That doesn't make sense. So constraint 3 is also important.

Given the scoring, Model 1 satisfies 6 out of 9 constraints (if we count mandatory for all activities as one constraint, but Interview is not mandatory, so it fails that). Model 2 satisfies maybe 5? Let's count strictly:

Model 1 satisfies: 1,2,3,5,6,7. That's 6. Fails 4 and 8.
Model 2 satisfies: 1,2,4,5,6 (order but not mandatory), 7 (order but not mandatory). But fails 3, and fails mandatory for Screen and Payroll. So maybe 5 or 6 with leniency.

But constraint 4 is satisfied in Model 2, which is important.

I think the key is that in Model 1, the process can complete without interviews, which is a fundamental flaw. In Model 2, the process can complete without screening and without payroll, but interviews are required. In many organizations, interviews are a non-negotiable step for hiring, while screening might be less formal or sometimes combined with interviews. Payroll is also non-negotiable, but maybe in some cases, payroll is handled by a different system, but still, it should be part of the process.

Given that, I'll choose Model 2 as more closely aligned because it ensures interviews are conducted before the hiring decision. The other anomalies can be considered as process variations that might be acceptable in some contexts (e.g., screening might be optional if all candidates are interviewed, payroll might be skipped if the employee is a contractor? But the process is for hiring an employee, so payroll should be there). However, the prompt says "typical Hire-to-Retire process", so we assume standard employee hiring.

I'll justify by saying that Model 2 enforces the critical dependency that interviews must precede the hiring decision, whereas Model 1 allows hiring without interviews, which is a severe violation of hiring best practices. The anomalies in Model 2, while significant, are less severe because screening can be considered a preliminary step that might be integrated, and the payroll skip might be a modeling error that can be corrected. The loop on onboarding might represent iterative onboarding tasks, which is plausible.

Thus, final answer: Model 2 more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process.

But wait, the prompt says "decide which model more closely aligns with a normative version". So we need to pick one.

I'll go with Model 2.

Now, write the answer.

### Analysis of POWL Models for Hire-to-Retire Process

#### **Normative Process Expectations**
A standard Hire-to-Retire process typically follows a sequential order:  
1. Post Job Advertisement  
2. Screen Candidates  
3. Conduct Interviews  
4. Make Hiring Decision  
5. Onboard Employee  
6. Add to Payroll  
7. Close Case  

All activities are mandatory, with screening preceding interviews, interviews preceding the decision, and onboarding and payroll following sequentially. Deviations from this order or optional execution of key steps compromise process integrity.

---

### **Model 1 Anomalies**
**Structure:**  
- Strict partial order with edges:  
  `Post  Screen  Decide` and `Screen  Interview`, with `Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close`.  
- No edges between `Interview` and `Decide`, and `Interview` has no outgoing edges.

**Anomalies:**
1. **Interview Not Required for Hiring Decision:**  
   - The model allows the sequence `Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close` without conducting interviews.  
   - This violates the fundamental principle that hiring decisions should be based on candidate interviews.

2. **Unconstrained Interview Timing:**  
   - `Interview` can occur concurrently with `Decide` or even after `Onboard`, `Payroll`, or `Close`, as it is only constrained to follow `Screen`.  
   - Interviews after the hiring decision or onboarding are logically incoherent.

3. **Mandatory Screening and Payroll:**  
   - Positive aspects: Screening is mandatory (edge `Post  Screen`), and payroll is mandatory (no skip option).

**Severity:**  
- High: Hiring without interviews is a critical flaw that undermines hiring quality and compliance.

---

### **Model 2 Anomalies**
**Structure:**  
- Strict partial order with `LOOP(Onboard, skip)` and `XOR(Payroll, skip)`.  
- Edges: `Post  Screen`, `Post  Interview`, `Interview  Decide`, `Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close`.

**Anomalies:**
1. **Screening Can Be Skipped:**  
   - No edge forces `Screen` to execute; the process can run `Post  Interview  Decide  ...` without screening.  
   - Screening is a best practice to filter candidates, but skipping it may be less severe than skipping interviews.

2. **No Order Between Screening and Interview:**  
   - `Screen` and `Interview` are concurrent after `Post`, allowing interviews before screening.  
   - This is inefficient but not a critical error.

3. **Payroll Can Be Skipped:**  
   - The `XOR` operator allows skipping `Add_to_Payroll`.  
   - Skipping payroll is a severe operational failure, as employees must be paid.

4. **Onboarding Loop:**  
   - `LOOP(Onboard, skip)` allows repeating onboarding multiple times.  
   - While unusual, this could represent iterative onboarding tasks and is not a critical error.

5. **Interview Mandatory Before Decision:**  
   - Positive aspect: Edge `Interview  Decide` ensures interviews always precede the hiring decision.

**Severity:**  
- High: Skipping payroll is a critical flaw.  
- Medium: Skipping screening and unordered screening/interviews are deviations from best practices.

### **Comparison and Decision**
**Which Model More Closely Aligns with Normative Process?**  
**Model 2** more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process.

**Justification:**  
- **Critical Dependency Enforcement:** Model 2 enforces that interviews must occur before the hiring decision (`Interview  Decide`), a key control point for hiring quality. In Model 1, interviews are optional and may be bypassed entirely, which is a more severe violation of hiring integrity.  
- **Correctable Anomalies:** Model 2’s anomalies—skipping screening and payroll—can be addressed by adding an edge `Screen  Interview` and removing the `skip` option from the `XOR` operator. These are relatively straightforward fixes. Model 1’s missing `Interview  Decide` edge is a fundamental design flaw that undermines the process logic.  
- **Process Flexibility:** The onboarding loop in Model 2 could be interpreted as supporting multiple onboarding tasks, which may be realistic. While the payroll skip is severe, it is an explicit choice point that could be misused, whereas Model 1’s interview omission is a structural oversight.

**Conclusion:**  
Model 2, despite its anomalies, preserves the essential ordering of interviews before hiring decisions, which is a cornerstone of responsible hiring. Model 1’s allowance of hiring without interviews represents a more fundamental deviation from standard practices. Therefore, Model 2 is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire workflow.
