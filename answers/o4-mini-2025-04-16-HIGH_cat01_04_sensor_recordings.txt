Here’s how I’d slice the 15 events into high-level activities:

1. Idle / Initialization  
   • Events 1–3 (08:00:00–08:00:10)  
   • Temperature around ambient (20–21 °C), zero vibration, zero material flow, minimal energy (~0.4–0.5 kWh)  
   • Rationale: Machine is powered but not working—just “spooling up” or waiting for a job.

2. Cutting Metal  
   • Events 4–6 (08:00:15–08:00:25)  
   • Temp jumps to 50–58 °C, vibration 30–38 Hz, material flow 5 units/s, tool position moving 510 mm, energy rising 23 kWh  
   • Rationale: High heat and vibration plus steady material feed and tool motion are classic of a cutting/chipping operation.

3. Assembling Parts  
   • Events 7–8 (08:00:30–08:00:35)  
   • Temp settles at 40 °C, vibration drops to ~10 Hz, flow down to 2 units/s, tool at 15 mm, energy ~2 kWh  
   • Rationale: Moderate, steady conditions with continued (but lighter) material handling suggest component fitting or automated fastening.

4. Welding  
   • Event 9 (08:00:40)  
   • Temp spikes to 80 °C, vibration jumps to 50 Hz, material flow drops to zero, energy peaks at 5 kWh  
   • Rationale: Very high heat and vibration, no feed of bulk material—signature of a welding arc or high-energy joining step.

5. Quality Inspection  
   • Event 10 (08:00:45)  
   • Temp has cooled to 30 °C, vibration nearly zero, no material flow, tool position still at the weld location, low energy (~1 kWh)  
   • Rationale: After welding you’d hold in place and scan/test; minimal movement or flow but still some power to sensors.

6. Packaging  
   • Events 11–12 (08:00:50–08:00:55)  
   • Temp ~25 °C, vibration ~5 Hz, light material flow (1 unit/s), tool position shifts to 20 mm, energy ~1.5 kWh  
   • Rationale: Slight flow and tool motion—likely moving finished parts onto a conveyor or into containers, with low-energy pick-and-place.

7. Idle / Shutdown  
   • Events 13–15 (08:01:00–08:01:10)  
   • Back to ambient temp (20–21 °C), zero vibration and flow, minimal energy (~0.4–0.5 kWh)  
   • Rationale: Cycle complete; machine returns to standby.

By looking at jumps and drops in temperature, vibration, material flow, tool movement and energy draw, we can clearly see the machine transitioning through “Idle  Cutting  Assembly  Welding  Inspection  Packaging  Idle.”
