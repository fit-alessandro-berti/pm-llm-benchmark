Here’s how the 15 events break down into seven logical “phases,” five of which map directly onto the typical manufacturing activities you asked about.  I’ve also identified the two idle/bounds phases so you can see the full cycle.

1. PreOperation Idle (Events 1–3)  
   • Temperature, pressure, vibration, flow and toolposition all at their “atrest” minima; very low energy draw.  
   • Rationale: The machine is powered on but not yet doing any work—sensors read baseline values.

2. Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)  
   • Sharp rise in temperature (5058 °C) and vibration (3038 Hz), steady material flow (~5 units/s) and tool movement (510 mm), energy climbs to 3 kWh.  
   • Rationale: High friction/heat + pronounced vibration + continuous material feed is characteristic of a cutting operation.

3. Assembling Parts (Events 7–8)  
   • Temperature and vibration drop to moderate levels (40 °C, 10 Hz), flow slows to 2 units/s, tool position holds at 15 mm, energy steadies at 2 kWh.  
   • Rationale: Lower forces and material flow with controlled tool positioning suggest the machine is inserting or fastening components rather than removing material.

4. Welding (Event 9)  
   • Peak temperature (80 °C), peak vibration (50 Hz), zero material flow, maximum energy draw (5 kWh).  
   • Rationale: Welding arcs generate intense local heat and vibration but don’t involve continuing material feed—fits a welding cycle.

5. Quality Inspection (Event 10)  
   • Rapid cooldown (30 °C), vibration falls to nearly zero, flow remains zero, energy drops to 1 kWh.  
   • Rationale: After welding, the machine idles briefly for inspection sensors (e.g. thermal or visual checks) before any further material movement.

6. Packaging/Transfer (Events 11–12)  
   • Modest temperature (25 °C) and vibration (5 Hz) resume, small material flow (1 unit/s), tool position advances to 20 mm, energy about 1.5 kWh.  
   • Rationale: Lowintensity motion with slight flow likely corresponds to moving the finished part off the machine or into a packaging fixture.

7. PostOperation Idle (Events 13–15)  
   • All readings return to baseline (20°C, zero vibration, zero flow, tool retracted to 0 mm, low energy).  
   • Rationale: The machine has completed its cycle and is back in standby until the next job.

Putting it all together, the inferred highlevel process for Machine M1 is:  
   1. Idle/Startup  
   2. Cutting Metal  
   3. Assembling Parts  
   4. Welding  
   5. Quality Inspection  
   6. Packaging/Transfer  
   7. Idle/Shutdown
