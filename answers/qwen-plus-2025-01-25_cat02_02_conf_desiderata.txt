### **Interpretations and Justifications**

1. **Case ID 2 Normative Violations**
   - **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:** This could indicate a procedural error or misunderstanding of the process. It might also suggest that the system allowed skipping steps unintentionally.
   - **Finalizing Documentation After Rejection:** This appears to be an administrative mistake, possibly due to miscommunication between teams handling the loan decision and documentation.

2. **Case ID 3 Desiderata Violations**
   - **Delayed Credit Check:** The delay could be due to high workload or resource constraints, leading to a backlog of applications.
   - **Delayed Notification to Applicant:** This might reflect inefficiencies in communication processes or delays caused by external factors (e.g., weekends).
   - **No Follow-up Call:** While not critical, this omission suggests a lack of attention to customer service best practices.
