## **Process Overview**

This process describes the handling of supplier invoices from receipt through to payment scheduling. It includes the main flow, decision points, exceptions, roles, and supporting artifacts.

---

## **Participants Involved**

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)** – Initial handling of invoices, matching, and routing.
- **Purchasing Department** – Verifies receipt of goods/services and invoice accuracy.
- **Department Manager** – Final approval authority.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor** – Handles exceptions and escalations.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** – Provides supplier-side support for invoice issues.
- **Accounting System** – Used throughout for logging, matching, and notifications.

---

    - **No:** Escalate to **AP Supervisor** for resolution.
      - **Supervisor Action:** Contact supplier or create retrospective PO if applicable.
      - **Outcome:** Invoice re-enters process at "Log Invoice".

---

### **4. Match Invoice Line Items to PO**

**Assigned To:** AP Clerk  
**Action:** Use the accounting system to match invoice line items to the PO.

---

---

**Action:** Schedule the invoice for payment in the next payment cycle.

**Artifact Updated:** Invoice Record (Payment Scheduled)

---

### **End Event:** Payment Scheduled

---

## **Exceptions and Alternate Flows**

- **Missing PO Number:** Requires supplier contact, may involve **Supplier Relationship Manager**.
- **Invoice-PO Mismatch:** May require correction, clarification, or escalation.
- **Escalation to AP Supervisor:** For unresolved discrepancies or missing documentation.
- **Manager Rejection:** Invoice is held and reprocessed after resolution.

---

## **Artifacts / Data Objects**

- Invoice (received via email)
- PO Number
- PO Record
- Invoice Record (in accounting system)
- Confirmation of Goods Receipt
- Invoice Matching Report
- Approval Request (system-generated)
- Payment Schedule

---

## **Notes on Ambiguity / Uncertainty**

- **PO Number Missing:** It's unclear whether the AP Clerk or Purchasing Department initiates the request for missing POs. Based on the interviews, it seems AP initiates, but Purchasing may also flag it.
- **Clarification Path:** When discrepancies are found, it's unclear whether Purchasing contacts the supplier directly or if AP Clerk does. Likely depends on the nature of the issue.
- **Manager Approval Mechanism:** While the system triggers the approval, it's unclear if the manager approves via email or directly in the system.
