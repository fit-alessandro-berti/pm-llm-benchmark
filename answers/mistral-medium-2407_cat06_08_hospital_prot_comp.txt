Based on the provided data, here are some potential unfair differences in treatment between the protected and unprotected groups:

1. Frequency of certain process variants: The unprotected group has a much higher frequency of some process variants compared to the protected group. For example, the unprotected group has a frequency of 1466 for the process variant "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge", while the protected group has a frequency of only 73 for a similar process variant. This could indicate that the unprotected group is being subjected to more thorough examinations and treatments, leading to longer wait times and potentially worse outcomes.
2. Performance times: The performance times for some process variants are significantly different between the two groups. For example, the protected group has a performance time of 320003.346 for the process variant "Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge", while the unprotected group has a performance time of 320002.980 for a similar process variant. While this difference may seem small, it could indicate that the protected group is receiving slower or less efficient treatment.
3. Treatment success rates: The data suggests that the protected group has a higher treatment success rate compared to the unprotected group. For example, the protected group has a frequency of 284 for the process variant "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge", while the unprotected group has a frequency of only 279 for a similar process variant. This could indicate that the protected group is receiving better quality treatment.
4. Discharge without treatment: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of being discharged without receiving any treatment (frequency = 505) compared to the protected group (frequency = 0). This could indicate that the unprotected group is being denied necessary medical care.
5. Treatment unsuccessful: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of treatment being unsuccessful and requiring further treatment compared to the protected group. For example, the unprotected group has a frequency of 225 for the process variant "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge", while the protected group has a frequency of only 48 for a similar process variant. This could indicate that the unprotected group is receiving lower quality treatment or that their medical conditions are more complex.

Overall, these differences suggest that the unprotected group may be receiving lower quality or less timely medical care compared to the protected group. Further investigation is needed to determine the root causes of these differences and to develop strategies to address any unfair treatment.
