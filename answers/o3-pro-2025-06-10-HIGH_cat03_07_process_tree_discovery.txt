Proposed final process tree (root operator = SEQUENCE “->”)

    'RA',                                              # Receive Application

    'AE',                                              # Assess Eligibility
    X (                                                # exclusive choice
        'AD',                                          #  – direct Approval Decision
        -> (                                           #  – or: handle missing information
            * (                                        #       loop = one-or-more RMI’s
                'RMI',                                 #         do-part: Request Missing Info
                tau                                    #         redo-part: silent (enables repetition)
            ),
            'VF',                                      #       re-validate the form
            'AD'                                       #       take the Approval Decision
        )
    ),
    'SC',                                              # Send Confirmation
    'AC'                                               # Archive Case
)

Interpretation of the model  
1. Every case starts with Receive Application, initial validation and eligibility assessment.  
2. After the assessment there is an exclusive choice:  
   • The file can be approved immediately (AD), or  
   • One or more requests for missing information can be issued (loop of RMI’s).  
     When the requester is satisfied, the form is validated once more and the approval decision is taken.  
3. Finally, the customer is informed (SC) and the case is archived (AC).

The tree reproduces all traces in the example log:

• Case 2: RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC (take the left XOR branch)  
• Case 1: RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC (one iteration of the loop)  
• Case 3: RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC (two loop iterations)

The loop *('RMI', ) guarantees at least one and any further number of consecutive “Request Missing Info” events, while the silent  keeps the model simple and precise.
