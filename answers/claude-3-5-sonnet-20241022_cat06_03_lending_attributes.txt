Based on the provided attributes, the following attributes can be considered sensitive from a fairness perspective:

1. case:citizen (True/False) - Citizenship status is a protected characteristic that could lead to discrimination in loan decisions.

2. case:gender (True/False) - Gender is a classic protected attribute that should not influence loan decisions unfairly.

3. case:german speaking (True/False) - Language ability or native language can be considered a proxy for national origin or ethnicity, which are protected characteristics.

These attributes are sensitive because:
- They are inherent personal characteristics that individuals cannot easily change
- They are legally protected characteristics in many jurisdictions
- Using them for decision-making could lead to discriminatory practices in loan approval
- They should not typically influence financial decisions unless there are legitimate, non-discriminatory business reasons

The other attributes like resource (loan officers), timestamps, and activity names are operational attributes that are not typically considered sensitive from a fairness perspective.
