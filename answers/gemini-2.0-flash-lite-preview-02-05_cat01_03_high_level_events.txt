**Output Explanation:**

1.  **Material Preparation:**  We group actions related to obtaining the raw material, verifying its identity, positioning it, and preheating it for processing. The goal is to prepare the material for the subsequent assembly steps.
2.  **Assembly:**  This stage comprises activities directly related to assembling the product. In this example, the core activity is welding, which directly contributes to the structure of the product.
3.  **Quality Inspection:** This stage involves checking a specific aspect of the assembly. The focus here is the weld, and we measure its integrity.
4.  **Surface Treatment:** These actions focus on applying and drying a protective coating.
5.  **Final Inspection:** A final visual check confirms overall quality, ensuring that the product meets requirements before it goes to the next phase (e.g., packaging, shipping).

This approach provides a clear and simplified view of the manufacturing process, abstracting away the low-level details while retaining the core stages of production. This high-level view is more suitable for process analysis, performance monitoring, and identifying bottlenecks.
