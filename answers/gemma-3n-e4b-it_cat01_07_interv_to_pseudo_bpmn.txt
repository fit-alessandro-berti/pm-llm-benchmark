*   The exact process for handling invoices with missing PO numbers is unclear.  Dan mentions asking Mary to get the PO, but the downstream impact isn't specified.
*   The frequency of "suspicious" invoices requiring manager intervention (Carlos) is approximate ("maybe once every couple of months").
*   The process for services contracted informally is not fully defined beyond involving department heads to create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice.
* The process after the manager rejects an invoice isn't clearly defined.
