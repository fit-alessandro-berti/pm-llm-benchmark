The visualization is a process flow diagram representing four distinct workflows related to order and invoice management. These workflows correspond to the following entities:
1. VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M objects) - green line
2. ReturnOrderItem (0.8M objects) - red line
3. PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M objects) - purple line
4. SalesOrderItem (3.5M objects) - orange line
5. PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M objects) - blue line

Each entity starts at its respective "Start" node and proceeds through various steps (processes), with the time taken for each transition between steps indicated in milliseconds (ms).

### Breakdown of the key workflows:

#### PurchaseRequisitionItem (Purple)
- Starts at "Start" (2.0M objects).
- Moves to "Create Requisition" (3.0M objects, 300ms).
- Then to "Approve Requisition" (5.7M objects, 250ms).
- From there, it either:
    - Goes to "Send Order" (5.2M objects, 200ms) and then "End" (150ms), or
    - Goes to "Check Stock" (1.0M objects, 500ms), then to "Approve Payment" (1.5M objects, 250ms), and finally "End" (180ms).

#### SalesOrderItem (Orange)
- Starts at "Start" (3.5M objects).
- Moves to "Create Order" (8.5M objects, 400ms).
- Then to "Pack Goods" (2.0M objects, 300ms).
- Then to "Ship Goods" (1.8M objects, 200ms).
- Next to "Confirm Delivery" (1.7M objects, 220ms).
- Followed by "Close Order" (1.7M objects, 180ms).
- Ends at "End" (150ms).

#### PurchaseOrderItem (Blue)
- Starts at "Start" (5.0M objects).
- Moves to "Create Order" (8.5M objects, 350ms).
- Moves to "Approve Requisition" (5.7M objects, 400ms).
- Then similar paths as above involving "Check Stock," "Approve Payment," "Create Invoice," and ends at "End."

#### VendorInvoiceItem (Green)
- Starts at "Start" (1.2M objects).
- Proceeds to "Approve Requisition" (5.7M objects, 600ms).
- Then can go to "Process Return" (0.8M objects, 650ms) or "Create Invoice" (2.0M objects, 800ms) leading to different End nodes.

#### ReturnOrderItem (Red)
- Starts at "Start" (0.8M objects).
- Goes to "Approve Requisition" (5.7M objects, 450ms).
- Then to "Process Return" (0.8M objects, 500ms).
- Leading to either "Close Order" (1.7M objects, 300ms) or "Create Invoice" (2.0M objects, 600ms), and then to End.

### General Observations:
- Multiple workflows converge and diverge at key process points such as "Approve Requisition," "Create Order," and "Process Return."
- The flow includes timings between steps, which help identify the duration of transitions and bottlenecks.
- The overall counts for each step differ, indicating different volumes of objects passing through each process.
- The colors represent different categories or workflows of order and invoice processing, distinguished clearly by route and process boxes.
- The visual has circular "Start" and "End" nodes representing entry and exit points.

This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of order, requisition, invoicing, and returns processes with timings, scopes, and interdependencies among multiple workflows.
