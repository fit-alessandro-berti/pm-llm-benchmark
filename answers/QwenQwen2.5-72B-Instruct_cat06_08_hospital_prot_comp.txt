To identify the main differences in the process variants between the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we need to look at both the frequency and performance (execution time) of each process variant. Here are the key points of comparison:

### 1. **Register at ER vs. Register at FD:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Register at ER: 158 cases, performance = 0.000
  - Register at FD: 156 cases, performance = 0.000
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Register at FD: 0 cases, performance = 0.000
  - Discharge: 505 cases, performance = 0.000

**Difference:** The protected group has a similar number of cases registering at both ER and FD, while the unprotected group has no cases registering at FD and a significant number of cases directly discharging.

### 2. **Thorough Examination:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 112 cases, performance = 319997.062
  - Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 130 cases, performance = 320003.346
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 656 cases, performance = 320002.980
  - Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 604 cases, performance = 320005.695

**Difference:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of thorough examination variants, and the performance times are slightly higher compared to the protected group.

### 3. **Expert Examination:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 174 cases, performance = 260009.195
  - Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 179 cases, performance = 260008.950
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 592 cases, performance = 260005.228
  - Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 653 cases, performance = 260001.864

**Difference:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of expert examination variants, but the performance times are slightly better compared to the protected group.

### 4. **Treatment Unsuccessful:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 40 cases, performance = 419997.200
  - Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 48 cases, performance = 420029.896
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 225 cases, performance = 480007.484
  - Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 190 cases, performance = 480007.142

**Difference:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of cases where treatment is initially unsuccessful, and the performance times are significantly higher compared to the protected group.

### 5. **Multiple Failed Treatments:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - No variants with multiple failed treatments.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 40 cases, performance = 639982.275
  - Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge: 35 cases, performance = 639972.457

**Difference:** The unprotected group has variants with multiple failed treatments, which are not present in the protected group.

### 6. **Overall Performance:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Most common variant: Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (284 cases, 260001.236)
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Most common variant: Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (1466 cases, 320004.432)

**Difference:** The most common variant in the protected group has a lower performance time compared to the most common variant in the unprotected group.

### Conclusion:
- **Frequency Differences:** The unprotected group has higher frequencies of more complex and prolonged treatment processes, including those with thorough examinations and multiple failed treatments.
- **Performance Differences:** The unprotected group generally has higher performance times, especially for variants involving treatment failures and multiple treatments.
- **Direct Discharge:** The unprotected group has a significant number of cases that directly discharge, which is not seen in the protected group.

These differences suggest potential disparities in the treatment processes and outcomes between the protected and unprotected groups, with the unprotected group experiencing more complex and time-consuming treatment paths.
