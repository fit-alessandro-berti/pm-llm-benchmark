To address the potential bias in the loan application review process, we will introduce new DECLARE constraints that ensure fairness and mitigate the risk of biased decisions based on sensitive attributes. The constraints will focus on ensuring that sensitive attribute checks are followed by appropriate mitigating actions before any final decisions are made. Here are the steps and the updated model:

### Updated `declare_model` Dictionary

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **Approve_Minority & ManualReview**: Ensures that any approval decision for a minority applicant is always accompanied by a manual review. This helps in ensuring that the decision is fair and consistent.
   - **Reject_Minority & ManualReview**: Similarly, ensures that any rejection decision for a minority applicant is always followed by a manual review to prevent biased outcomes.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace & BiasMitigationCheck**: Ensures that any check of the applicant's race is followed by a bias mitigation check. This ensures that the sensitive information is handled with care and mitigates the risk of biased decisions.

3. **Succession Constraints:**
   - **BiasMitigationCheck & Approve**: Ensures that an approval decision can only follow a bias mitigation check, ensuring that any approval is fair and not influenced by sensitive attributes without proper mitigation.
   - **BiasMitigationCheck & Reject**: Ensures that a rejection decision can only follow a bias mitigation check, ensuring that any rejection is fair and not influenced by sensitive attributes without proper mitigation.

4. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace & Reject**: Prevents a direct succession from checking the applicant's race to rejecting the application. This ensures that the decision is not based solely on the race without proper mitigation.
   - **CheckApplicantRace & Approve**: Similarly, prevents a direct succession from checking the applicant's race to approving the application. This ensures that the decision is not based solely on the race without proper mitigation.

By adding these constraints, we ensure that the loan application process is fair and consistent, reducing the risk of biased decisions based on sensitive attributes. These constraints help in maintaining transparency and accountability in the decision-making process.
