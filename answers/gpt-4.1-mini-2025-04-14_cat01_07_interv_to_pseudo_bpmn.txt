Here is a consolidated BPMN-like textual process model based on the interview excerpts:

---

### Participants / Roles:
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**
- **Supplier** (external party)

### Artifacts / Data Objects:
- **Invoice** (input document)
- **Purchase Order (PO)**
- **Confirmation of goods/services receipt**
- **Matching result (Invoice vs PO)**
- **Approval notification/email**
- **Exception details** (discrepancies, missing info)
- **Payment schedule**

---

### Process Flow Description:

#### 1. Invoice Receipt and Initial Validation (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk – Mary)
- **Start:** Invoice is received by Accounts Payable (usually via email).
- **Task:** Check if invoice contains a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
  - **Decision Gateway:**  
    - If **PO number is missing**, then:  
      -> Send invoice back to Supplier requesting PO details (involvement: Supplier Relationship Manager may support escalation).  
      -> Wait until revised invoice with PO is received.  
      (Alternative flow: Supplier sends corrected invoice with PO after intervention.)
    - If **PO number present**, proceed to next step.
- **Task:** Log invoice into accounting system.
- **Task:** Forward invoice to Purchasing department for receipt confirmation.

#### 2. Purchase Confirmation and Invoice Matching (Role: Purchasing Officer – Dan)
- **Task:** Upon receiving invoice from Accounts Payable, check whether invoice details align with PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges).
- **Decision Gateway:**  
  - If **discrepancies found**, then:  
    -> Contact Supplier directly or ask Accounts Payable to hold invoice until corrected invoice or clarification received.  
    -> If unresolved at Accounts Payable Clerk level, escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
  - If **no discrepancies**, send confirmation email back to Accounts Payable.
- **Note:** If PO is missing or invalid at this step, Purchasing requests Accounts Payable to obtain it first (loop back to initial step).
- **Output:** Confirmation of receipt and correctness of invoice details.

#### 3. Invoice Matching and Manager Approval (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk and Department Manager – Carlos)
- **Task:** After receiving confirmation from Purchasing, match invoice line items against PO in accounting system.
- **Decision Gateway:**  
  - If **matching successful**, proceed to manager approval.  
  - If **discrepancy detected**, email Purchasing for clarification or escalate to Supervisor if needed (loop back to step 2 or escalation).
- **Task:** System sends automatic approval request email to Department Manager.
- **Task:** Department Manager reviews invoice, PO, and confirmation.
- **Decision Gateway:**  
  - If **manager approves**, process continues.  
  - If **manager rejects or raises concern** (e.g., suspicious differences, budget issues), they ask Accounts Payable to hold investigation or reject invoice.  
    - This may trigger additional review, rework, or escalation to Supervisor.
- **Output:** Manager approval or hold/reject notification.

#### 4. Exception Handling and Escalation (Role: Accounts Payable Supervisor – Rita and Supplier Relationship Manager – Karen)
- **Trigger:** Exceptions escalate here when normal resolution fails or for special cases such as:  
  - Missing PO invoices for informal services.  
  - Persistent discrepancies not resolved by Clerk or Purchasing.  
- **Task:** Supervisor contacts suppliers, coordinates with departments to resolve issues.  
- **Task:** For informal service invoices, Supervisor works with department heads to generate retrospective PO or decides to reject invoice outright.  
- **Output:** Issue resolved -> Invoice returned to normal flow (Purchasing confirmation  Manager approval  Payment scheduling).  
- **Note:** Supervisor ensures no invoice stays stuck indefinitely but does not perform approvals.

- **Support Role:** Supplier Relationship Manager intervenes if supplier interaction is required to resolve missing PO, pricing discrepancies, or contractual clarifications.

#### 5. Payment Scheduling (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk / Accounts Payable Team)
- **Task:** After manager approval, Accounts Payable schedules payment for the invoice in the next payment run.
- **End:** Invoice processed and payment arranged.

### Summary of Sequence Flow and Gateways:
1. **Invoice received**  
2. **Check PO present?**  
   - No  Request PO from Supplier (via AP Clerk / Supplier Relations)  
   - Yes  Log invoice  Send to Purchasing  
3. **Purchasing confirmation of goods/services received and invoice details correct?**  
   - No  Hold invoice, contact supplier, escalate if unresolved  
   - Yes  Confirmation sent to AP  
4. **Accounts Payable matches invoice against PO**  
   - If discrepancy  Query Purchasing or escalate  
   - If match  Proceed  
5. **Manager approval requested**  
   - Approve  Schedule payment  
   - Reject/Hold  Investigate/escalate  
6. **Exceptions escalated to Supervisor**  
7. **Payments scheduled and completed**

---

### Noted Variations and Uncertainties:
- In some cases, after discrepancies arise, Accounts Payable escalates directly to Supervisor without awaiting Purchasing resolution.  
- The exact mechanism of “sending invoice back to supplier” may involve Supplier Relationship Manager support, but not consistently.  
- Manager rejection frequency is low ("once every couple of months"), indicating these are exception paths.  
- Informal service invoices without a PO require retrospective approval, handled only by Supervisor and department heads.  
- The final payment scheduling is managed by Accounts Payable after manager approval; the exact role performing payment runs beyond scheduling is not detailed.
