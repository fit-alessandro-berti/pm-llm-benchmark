### Summary and Interpretation

**Normative Rule Violations:**
- **Case ID 2:** Violates the sequence by performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check.

**Desiderata Violations:**
- **Case ID 3:** 
  - Credit Check timing is not adhered to (more than 24 hours delay).
  - Inform Applicant timing is not adhered to (more than 48 hours delay).
  - No follow-up call is performed.

**Possible Interpretations/Justifications:**

- For **Case 2**, the sequence of activities could have been altered due to an oversight or a special circumstance such as an urgent request for a risk assessment, and then the Credit Check was conducted afterward. However, this is a serious violation and should be corrected to maintain process integrity.
  
- For **Case 3**, the delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant could be due to various reasons, such as a backlog in the processing system, specific customer requests, or unforeseen circumstances. The lack of a follow-up call might indicate that the process was focused on efficiency or that a different form of communication was used which is not recorded in the log.

In conclusion, the cases should be reviewed to ensure compliance with the normative rules, and the desiderata conditions should be used as guidelines to improve the overall efficiency and customer satisfaction of the loan application process.
