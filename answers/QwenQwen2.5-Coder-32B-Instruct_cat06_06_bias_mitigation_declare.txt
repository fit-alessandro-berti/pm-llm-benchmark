To address the potential bias in the loan application review process, we will add several new constraints to the DECLARE model. These constraints will ensure that sensitive attributes do not lead to immediate and potentially biased decisions, and that additional checks are conducted to mitigate bias.

### Updated `declare_model` with Bias Mitigation Constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Each Added Constraint:

1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - **Rationale:** Ensure these activities are present in the process to enforce fairness and mitigate bias.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **Coexistence between `Approve_Minority/Reject_Minority` and `ManualReview`:**
     - **Rationale:** This ensures that any decision involving a sensitive demographic (e.g., minority group) is always linked with a manual review, adding a layer of fairness and scrutiny.

3. **Response and Succession Constraints:**
   - **Response from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
     - **Rationale:** This ensures that after checking the sensitive attribute, a bias mitigation step is taken before making any decision, reducing the likelihood of immediate biased outcomes.
   - **Response from `BiasMitigationCheck` to `Approve` or `Reject`:**
     - **Rationale:** This ensures that after bias mitigation, a final decision is made, upholding fairness and accuracy.

4. **Non-Succession Constraints:**
   - **Non-Succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Approve`, `Reject`, `FinalDecision`:**
     - **Rationale:** This prevents the immediate succession of sensitive attribute checks to decision steps, obliging a bias mitigation check first, thereby ensuring fairness and consistency in decision-making.

These changes ensure that sensitive attributes do not influence loan decisions unfairly, maintaining the integrity and fairness of the loan application review process.
