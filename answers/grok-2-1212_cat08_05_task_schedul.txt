### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

#### Process Mining Approach:
To analyze the historical scheduling performance and dynamics at Precision Parts Inc., we would employ process mining techniques on the MES event logs. This involves several steps:

- **Event Log Processing:** The event logs would be pre-processed to ensure data quality, including handling missing values, timestamp alignment, and ensuring consistency in event types and attributes.
- **Process Discovery:** We would use process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristic Miner) to reconstruct the actual flow of jobs and the sequence of tasks executed on different machines. This would provide a visual representation of the process, highlighting common paths and deviations.
- **Conformance Checking:** By comparing the actual process execution against a predefined model (if available), we can identify deviations and non-conformances that impact scheduling performance.

#### Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:

- **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
  - **Technique:** Use process mining to extract cycle time metrics for each job (from job release to completion).
  - **Metrics:** Calculate average, median, and distribution of flow times, lead times, and makespans. Use histograms and box plots to visualize these distributions.

- **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times) at Each Work Center/Machine:**
  - **Technique:** Analyze the time difference between "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events for each task.
  - **Metrics:** Compute average and distribution of waiting times at each work center. Identify machines with the highest average queue times.

- **Resource Utilization (Machine and Operator):**
  - **Technique:** Aggregate the "Task Start" and "Task End" events to calculate productive time, and use "Setup Start" and "Setup End" events for setup time. Calculate idle time as the difference between total available time and the sum of productive and setup times.
  - **Metrics:** Calculate utilization rates, idle times, and setup times for each machine and operator. Use heatmaps to visualize utilization patterns over time.

- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
  - **Technique:** Analyze the "Setup Start" and "Setup End" events, considering the previous job processed on the same machine (captured in the "Notes" field).
  - **Metrics:** Quantify the average setup time for different job sequences. Use clustering or decision trees to model the impact of job properties on setup times.

- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
  - **Technique:** Compare the actual completion times (from "Task End" events) against the due dates specified in the logs.
  - **Metrics:** Calculate the percentage of jobs completed on time, average tardiness, and distribution of tardiness. Use control charts to monitor trends over time.

- **Impact of Disruptions on Schedules and KPIs:**
  - **Technique:** Identify "Breakdown Start" and "Priority Change" events and correlate them with changes in job flow times and tardiness.
  - **Metrics:** Measure the average increase in job flow times and tardiness due to disruptions. Use root cause analysis to identify the most significant disruptors.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

#### Key Pathologies and Inefficiencies:

- **Bottleneck Resources:**
  - **Identification:** Use process mining to identify machines with consistently high utilization rates and long queue times.
  - **Impact:** Quantify the impact on overall throughput by analyzing the correlation between bottleneck machine delays and job completion times.

- **Poor Task Prioritization:**
  - **Evidence:** Analyze the frequency and impact of priority changes on job flow times, especially for high-priority or near-due date jobs.
  - **Impact:** Measure the average delay for high-priority jobs and the frequency of priority changes leading to disruptions.

- **Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Times:**
  - **Evidence:** Identify instances where the sequence of jobs on a machine leads to longer than average setup times.
  - **Impact:** Quantify the increase in total setup time and its effect on job flow times and machine utilization.

- **Resource Starvation:**
  - **Evidence:** Use process mining to detect periods of idle time for downstream resources following upstream bottlenecks.
  - **Impact:** Measure the frequency and duration of resource starvation events and their impact on overall lead times.

- **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
  - **Evidence:** Analyze variations in WIP levels at different stages of the process, correlating them with scheduling decisions and disruptions.
  - **Impact:** Quantify the variability in WIP levels and its correlation with lead time variability and schedule adherence.

#### Using Process Mining for Evidence:

- **Bottleneck Analysis:** Use process mining to highlight machines with the highest utilization and longest queue times, providing evidence of bottlenecks.
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare process variants for on-time vs. late jobs to identify patterns in task sequencing, priority handling, and resource allocation that lead to delays.
- **Resource Contention Analysis:** Identify periods of high resource contention and analyze their impact on job flow times and waiting times.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

#### Potential Root Causes:

- **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:**
  - Static rules do not adapt to dynamic changes in job priorities, machine availability, or disruptions, leading to suboptimal scheduling decisions.

- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
  - Without real-time data on machine status, queue lengths, and job progress, scheduling decisions are made based on outdated information, exacerbating delays and inefficiencies.

- **Inaccurate Task Duration and Setup Time Estimations:**
  - If planning relies on inaccurate estimates, schedules will deviate from reality, leading to increased tardiness and WIP.

- **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:**
  - Failing to account for sequence-dependent setups leads to longer setup times and reduced machine utilization.

- **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:**
  - Lack of coordination results in resource starvation and increased WIP as jobs wait unnecessarily at different stages.

- **Inadequate Response to Disruptions:**
  - Without strategies to handle breakdowns or urgent orders, disruptions can cascade through the system, significantly impacting schedules.

#### Differentiating Issues Using Process Mining:

- **Poor Scheduling Logic vs. Resource Capacity Limitations:**
  - Process mining can help distinguish between issues by analyzing the impact of different scheduling decisions on KPIs. For example, if changing the sequencing of jobs reduces setup times and improves utilization, it suggests a scheduling logic issue. Conversely, if adding capacity to a bottleneck machine leads to significant improvements, it indicates a resource capacity limitation.
- **Inherent Process Variability:**
  - By analyzing the variability in task durations and setup times, process mining can identify whether scheduling issues are due to inherent process variability or poor scheduling decisions.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules

- **Core Logic:** Implement dynamic dispatching rules that consider multiple factors such as remaining processing time (RPT), due date (DD), priority (P), downstream machine load (DML), and estimated sequence-dependent setup time (EST). The rule could be a weighted sum of these factors, where weights are adjusted based on real-time shop floor conditions.
- **Use of Process Mining:** Historical data from process mining would inform the weighting of factors. For example, if analysis shows that sequence-dependent setups significantly impact flow times, EST would be given a higher weight.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** This strategy addresses poor task prioritization and suboptimal sequencing by dynamically adjusting task priorities based on multiple factors, reducing delays and improving resource utilization.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduced tardiness and improved resource utilization due to better prioritization and sequencing of tasks.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling

- **Core Logic:** Use historical task duration distributions and predictive maintenance insights to generate realistic schedules. Machine learning models would predict task durations based on factors like operator, job complexity, and machine health, allowing for proactive identification of potential bottlenecks and delays.
- **Use of Process Mining:** Process mining would provide the historical data needed to train predictive models, including task duration distributions and patterns of machine breakdowns.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** This strategy addresses unpredictable lead times and the impact of disruptions by predicting potential delays and adjusting schedules accordingly.
- **Expected Impact:** More accurate lead time estimates and reduced tardiness due to proactive scheduling adjustments.

#### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization

- **Core Logic:** Implement a strategy focused on minimizing sequence-dependent setup times through intelligent batching of similar jobs and optimized sequencing at bottleneck machines. Use historical data to identify job sequences that minimize setup times.
- **Use of Process Mining:** Analyze historical setup patterns to identify optimal job sequences and develop algorithms for job batching and sequencing.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** This strategy directly addresses suboptimal sequencing and setup times, improving machine utilization and reducing job flow times.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduced setup times, increased machine utilization, and decreased job flow times.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

#### Discrete-Event Simulation:

- **Approach:** Use discrete-event simulation tools (e.g., AnyLogic, Simio) to model the shop floor operations, parameterized with data derived from process mining, such as task time distributions, routing probabilities, breakdown frequencies, and setup time models.
- **Scenarios to Test:**
  - **High Load:** Simulate periods of high demand to test the robustness of scheduling strategies under pressure.
  - **Frequent Disruptions:** Simulate scenarios with frequent machine breakdowns and urgent jobs to assess the effectiveness of strategies in handling disruptions.
  - **Baseline Comparison:** Compare the performance of new strategies against the current scheduling approach to quantify improvements in KPIs.

#### Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:

- **Framework for Continuous Improvement:**
  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement real-time process mining to continuously track KPIs such as tardiness, WIP, lead times, and resource utilization.
  - **Drift Detection:** Use process mining to detect drifts or new inefficiencies in the scheduling process. This could involve statistical process control techniques to identify significant deviations from expected performance.
  - **Automated Adjustments:** Develop algorithms that automatically adjust scheduling parameters based on detected drifts or inefficiencies. For example, if a machine's utilization drops significantly, the system could adjust the weights in the dispatching rules to prioritize tasks for that machine.
  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop where insights from ongoing process mining are used to refine predictive models and scheduling strategies, ensuring continuous improvement.
