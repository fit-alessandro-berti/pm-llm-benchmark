### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

- **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: Average ~25 hours (90,000 seconds) with an unusually low STDEV of 3,600 seconds (~1 hour). This tight variance suggests artificially rigid timing, potentially indicating scripted or bulk-processed approvals rather than natural variability.
- **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: Extremely long average of 604,800 seconds (7 days) with high STDEV of 172,800 seconds (2 days). This points to inconsistent, prolonged delays post-approval, possibly due to backlogs or conditional holds.
- **A to C (Assign to Close)**: Short average of 7,200 seconds (2 hours) implies rapid claim closures skipping intermediate steps like evaluation or approval, which deviates from the expected sequential flow.
- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: Very short average of 300 seconds (5 minutes) with low STDEV of 60 seconds (1 minute), suggesting automated or rushed transitions that bypass realistic review/decision times.

These patterns indicate process irregularities, such as skipped steps, artificial timing, or resource-dependent bottlenecks.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

- **Rigid low-STDEV intervals (e.g., R to P, E to N)**: Likely due to automated scripts or batch jobs enforcing fixed delays/checks, possibly to simulate compliance while skipping manual oversight, or system glitches inserting uniform pauses.
- **Prolonged high-variance delays (e.g., P to N)**: Could stem from manual bottlenecks like approval queues, waiting for external verifications (e.g., fraud checks), or resource shortages where notifications are deprioritized.
- **Short A to C spans**: Suggests "fast-track" closures for low-risk claims, override permissions for certain adjusters, or data entry errors where events are backdated or duplicated.
- **Overall inconsistencies**: May reflect adjuster-specific behaviors (e.g., specialized vs. general), claim type variations (e.g., auto vs. home), or regional differences in workload/automation adoption.

### Verification Approaches with SQL Queries

1. **Claims with R to P outside expected range (e.g., Z-score > 2 based on profile)**:
   ```sql
   WITH ra_times AS (
     SELECT ce1.claim_id,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_between
     FROM claim_events ce1
     JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
       AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
   )
   SELECT claim_id, seconds_between
   FROM ra_times
   WHERE ABS((seconds_between - 90000) / 3600) > 2;  -- >2 STDEV from mean
   ```

2. **Claims with suspiciously quick A to C (< 2 hours, potential skips)**:
   ```sql
   SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.resource AS assigner,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_to_close
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
     AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200
   ORDER BY seconds_to_close;
   ```

3. **P to N delays >7 days, correlated with adjusters and claim types**:
   ```sql
   WITH pn_times AS (
     SELECT ce1.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.name AS approver,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_delay
     FROM claim_events ce1
     JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
     LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
     WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
       AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
   )
   SELECT claim_type, approver, AVG(seconds_delay) AS avg_delay, COUNT(*) AS count
   FROM pn_times
   WHERE seconds_delay > 604800  -- >7 days
   GROUP BY claim_type, approver
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
   ORDER BY avg_delay DESC;
   ```

4. **E to N ultra-quick transitions (<10 min), checking for missing intermediates**:
   ```sql
   SELECT ce1.claim_id,
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS seconds_en
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_inter ON ce1.claim_id = ce_inter.claim_id
     AND ce_inter.activity IN ('P')  -- Check if Approve skipped
     AND ce1.timestamp < ce_inter.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 600
     AND ce_inter.event_id IS NULL  -- No intermediate P
   ORDER BY seconds_en;
   ```

5. **Overall anomaly summary by resource/region (join with claims/adjusters)**:
   ```sql
   SELECT res.resource, a.region, c.claim_type,
          AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (later.timestamp - earlier.timestamp))) AS avg_interval,
          STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (later.timestamp - earlier.timestamp))) AS stdev
   FROM claim_events earlier
   JOIN claim_events later ON earlier.claim_id = later.claim_id
   JOIN claims c ON earlier.claim_id = c.claim_id
   LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON later.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
   WHERE earlier.activity IN ('R', 'A', 'E', 'P')
     AND later.activity IN ('P', 'N', 'C')
     AND earlier.timestamp < later.timestamp
   GROUP BY res.resource, a.region, c.claim_type
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
   ORDER BY avg_interval DESC;
   ```
