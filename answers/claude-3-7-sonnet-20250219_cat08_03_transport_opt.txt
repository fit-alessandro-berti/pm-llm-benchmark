# Comprehensive Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

To create a cohesive event log suitable for process mining from Speedy Parcels' diverse data sources, I would implement the following approach:

**Data Integration Framework:**
- Create a unified temporal framework where all events are synchronized to a single timeline
- Establish consistent case IDs (Vehicle-Day as the primary case identifier, with secondary package-level cases for delivery-specific analysis)
- Normalize location data by converting all GPS coordinates to consistent formats and linking to logical locations (customer addresses, depot, etc.)

**Entity Resolution:**
- Match scanner events with corresponding GPS events by timestamp and location proximity
- Link package IDs to specific customer stops and planned routes
- Associate maintenance events with specific vehicles and operational periods

**Event Enrichment:**
- Calculate derived attributes like dwell time at stops, driving time between stops, and idle time
- Enrich with contextual information such as weather conditions, traffic patterns, and delivery window compliance
- Add semantic labels to distinguish productive activities (deliveries) from non-productive ones (traffic delays, maintenance)

**Data Quality Challenges:**
- **Temporal inconsistencies:** GPS and scanner timestamps may not align perfectly due to clock synchronization issues
- **Missing data:** GPS signal drops in urban canyons; scanner events missed by drivers
- **Granularity differences:** GPS data is high-frequency while scanner events are sparse
- **Location accuracy:** GPS error margins may complicate matching locations to specific stops
- **Event sequence ambiguity:** Determining when a vehicle is actually at a customer location versus nearby

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Apply fuzzy temporal matching with configurable thresholds to link related events
- Implement data quality indicators to flag suspicious patterns (e.g., impossible travel speeds)
- Use interpolation techniques for missing GPS points along known routes
- Apply map-matching algorithms to snap GPS coordinates to the road network
- Deduplicate redundant events from different sources

### Process Discovery

To visualize the actual end-to-end delivery process, I would:

**Apply Multi-perspective Process Discovery:**
- Use inductive mining algorithms that can handle noise and infrequent behavior
- Create hierarchical process models with different abstraction levels:
  * Macro level: depot  delivery region  depot
  * Mid level: sequence of customer stops with transportation between them
  * Micro level: detailed activity sequence at each customer (arrive  attempt delivery  success/failure  depart)

**Enhance Process Models with:**
- Temporal dimensions showing typical durations and their distributions
- Spatial dimensions using process maps overlaid on geographical maps
- Resource perspectives showing driver behavior patterns
- Decision points highlighting factors influencing process paths (e.g., when re-delivery attempts occur)

**Specialized Transportation Visualizations:**
- Spaghetti diagrams showing actual routes taken across the service area
- Dotted charts displaying vehicle activities throughout the day, highlighting productive vs. non-productive time
- Animation replays of vehicle movements to identify traffic hotspots and unusual patterns

### Conformance Checking

To compare discovered processes against planned routes:

**Alignment-Based Conformance:**
- Construct reference models from dispatch system's planned routes
- Calculate fitness metrics between actual and planned processes
- Highlight deviations using token replay techniques
- Quantify the cost of deviations in terms of time, distance, and fuel consumption

**Key Deviation Types to Identify:**
1. **Sequence deviations:** Altered stop order compared to planned route
2. **Time deviations:** Early/late arrivals at stops or significant variations in service time
3. **Route deviations:** Alternative paths taken between stops
4. **Unplanned activities:** Unexpected stops for breaks, refueling, or maintenance
5. **Skipped activities:** Failed delivery attempts or bypassed stops
6. **Added activities:** Last-minute package additions or returns processing

**Conformance Visualization:**
- Heat maps showing geographic areas with highest deviation frequencies
- Timeline visualizations highlighting when deviations occur during shifts
- Superimposed actual vs. planned routes with deviation indicators
- Driver-specific conformance patterns to identify systematic behavior differences

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### Potential Root Causes

**Route Planning Issues:**
- **Static vs. Dynamic Routing:** Analysis of actual routes against planned routes will likely reveal significant deviations due to:
  * Lack of real-time traffic incorporation in route planning
  * Fixed route sequences that fail to adapt to daily conditions
  * Incomplete consideration of historical travel time patterns by time of day
- **Verification Method:** Compare performance of routes with high adherence to plan versus those with significant deviations. If deviations correlate with better performance, this suggests suboptimal static routing.

**Time Estimation Inaccuracies:**
- **Unrealistic Service Time Allocations:** Process mining may reveal that planned service times don't match reality:
  * Failure to account for different package types/sizes in time allocation
  * Insufficient consideration of building access differences (apartment complexes vs. houses)
  * Not differentiating between commercial and residential deliveries
- **Verification Method:** Analyze the distribution of actual service times by location type, building type, and package characteristics to develop more accurate time estimation models.

**Traffic Pattern Impact:**
- **Systemic Traffic Congestion:** GPS data analysis may show:
  * Consistent low-speed segments during specific time windows
  * Routes repeatedly affected by predictable congestion events
  * Failure to avoid known traffic hotspots during peak hours
- **Verification Method:** Map GPS speed data against time of day and location to identify recurring patterns and quantify their impact on delivery schedules.

**Service Time Variability:**
- **Customer Interaction Inefficiencies:** Scanner event timing analysis may reveal:
  * Excessive time spent locating proper drop-off locations
  * Delays due to package handover protocols (signatures, ID verification)
  * Time lost on failed delivery documentation
- **Verification Method:** Compare service time distributions across customers, package types, and drivers to identify outliers and pattern differences.

**Vehicle Reliability Issues:**
- **Preventable Maintenance Events:** Combining operational and maintenance logs may show:
  * Correlation between specific driving patterns and subsequent breakdowns
  * Maintenance issues occurring after operating in certain areas/conditions
  * Specific vehicle models with disproportionate reliability problems
- **Verification Method:** Analyze timeline sequences before maintenance events to identify predictive patterns and precursors to breakdowns.

**Driver Behavior Variations:**
- **Skill and Experience Gaps:** Cross-driver performance analysis may reveal:
  * Significant differences in navigation efficiency between drivers
  * Variations in ability to optimize stop sequence on-the-fly
  * Different approaches to managing failed delivery situations
- **Verification Method:** Compare process variants between high-performing and low-performing drivers on similar routes to identify best practices.

**Failed Delivery Impacts:**
- **Avoidable Reattempts:** Failed delivery analysis may show:
  * Patterns in timing of failed attempts (customer availability by time of day)
  * Geographical clusters of consistent delivery failures
  * Inadequate customer communication leading to unnecessary attempts
- **Verification Method:** Calculate the cascading impact of each failed delivery on subsequent deliveries and analyze preconditions of successful vs. failed attempts.
