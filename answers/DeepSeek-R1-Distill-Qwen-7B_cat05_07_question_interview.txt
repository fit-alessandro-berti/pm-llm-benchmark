Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a list of targeted, open-ended questions based on the detailed description provided about the property onboarding process. The goal is to understand the process better by digging deeper into various aspects like missing details, decision criteria, roles and responsibilities, timing and sequencing, and how exceptions are handled.

First, I'll start by reading through the entire onboarding process description carefully to get a clear picture of each step. The process begins with a contact from a landlord requesting services, followed by coordination with documentation review, assigning a property manager, communication during the assignment, scheduling photographers and inspectors, marketing, activation in the rental portal, tenant screening, and finally quality checks and audits.

I'll think about each of these steps and identify key points where more detailed questions could be helpful. For example, in the initial documentation review, it mentions that the coordinator verifies documents but doesn't always specify why some documents might be missing or outdated. So, I should ask why those documents are important and what happens if they're missing.

Next, assigning the property manager depends on workload, geographic specialization, experience, and track record with unique landlord needs. I should ask about the criteria they use when selecting a manager and how they assess a manager's experience with challenging cases like furnished rentals.

The assignment process also involves scheduling a meeting between the property manager and the landlord. I should ask what the purpose of this meeting is and what topics are typically discussed, such as pet policies or maintenance responsibilities.

After the marketing team sets up the property, there's a check by the compliance officer and financial analyst. I need to understand what specific checks each role performs and how these checks contribute to the overall process.

When the property is activated, the property manager handles tenant screening. I should inquire about the screening process, including how they assess creditworthiness, verify employment, and handle multiple applications.

Finally, the quality checks and audits involve compliance officers and others. I want to know what specific aspects are audited and how often this process happens.

I should also consider potential exceptions, like special insurance requirements or landlords with custom lease clauses. It's important to ask how these are handled and what additional steps are taken in such cases.

I'll structure the questions to be open-ended, allowing the interviewee to provide detailed responses, and avoid any technical jargon or SQL queries as instructed.
