### **Analysis and Labeled Activities**

Based on the patterns observed in the sensor readings, the events can be grouped into distinct phases that likely correspond to specific manufacturing activities. Below is the grouping, labeling, and rationale for each.

#### **1. Idle/Initialization**
| **Event #** | **Label**       | **Rationale**                                                                                       |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15 | **Idle/Initialization** | Consistently low temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, and energy consumption. Tool position at 0 indicates no active operation. |

#### **2. Material Preparation/Cutting**
| **Event #** | **Label**               | **Rationale**                                                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4, 5, 6     | **Material Preparation/Cutting** | Rapid increase in temperature, vibration, and material flow. Increased tool position suggests active cutting. |

#### **3. Pressuring/Assembling**
| **Event #** | **Label**       | **Rationale**                                                                                       |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7, 8       | **Pressuring/Assembling** | Moderately higher pressure, slight vibration, reduced material flow, and steady tool position, indicating assembly under controlled pressure. |

#### **4. Welding**
| **Event #** | **Label** | **Rationale**                                                                                       |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 9          | **Welding** | Peak temperature, increased vibration, no material flow (suggesting a joining process), and high energy consumption. |

#### **5. Inspection/Adjustment**
| **Event #** | **Label**              | **Rationale**                                                                                       |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10         | **Inspection/Adjustment** | Drop in all parameters back to near idle levels, except for tool position, suggesting a check or minor adjustment. |

#### **6. Final Assembly/Quality Check**
| **Event #** | **Label**                  | **Rationale**                                                                                       |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11, 12     | **Final Assembly/Quality Check** | Low to moderate readings across all sensors, with slight material flow and stable tool position, indicating a final check or light assembly. |

### **Detailed Explanation per Activity**

#### **1. Idle/Initialization**
- **Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
- **Pattern:** All readings are at or near baseline levels (Temperature: ~20°C, Pressure: 1 bar, Vibration: 0 Hz, Material Flow: 0 units/s, Tool Position: 0 mm, Energy: ~0.45 kWh).
- **Rationale:** These events likely represent the machine in an idle state or initializing for a new cycle, given the lack of activity indicated by all sensors.

#### **2. Material Preparation/Cutting**
- **Events:** 4, 5, 6
- **Pattern:** Significant increase in Temperature (up to 58°C), Vibration (up to 38 Hz), Material Flow (5 units/s), and Energy Consumption (up to 3 kWh). Tool Position increases from 0 to 10 mm.
- **Rationale:** The sharp increase in temperature, vibration, and the fact that material is flowing suggest an active operation like cutting. The tool movement further supports this.

#### **3. Pressuring/Assembling**
- **Events:** 7, 8
- **Pattern:** Pressure increases to 2 bar, a moderate Vibration (10 Hz), reduced Material Flow (2 units/s), and Tool Position stabilizes at 15 mm. Temperature drops slightly from the previous phase.
- **Rationale:** The increased pressure and moderate vibration, coupled with reduced material flow, suggest an assembling process where parts are pressed together under controlled conditions.

#### **4. Welding**
- **Event:** 9
- **Pattern:** Peak readings for Temperature (80°C), Vibration (50 Hz), and Energy Consumption (5 kWh). Material Flow ceases, and Tool Position remains constant.
- **Rationale:** The extreme temperature and high energy usage, along with the absence of material flow, strongly indicate a welding operation.

#### **5. Inspection/Adjustment**
- **Event:** 10
- **Pattern:** Rapid decline in all readings back towards idle levels, except Tool Position remains at 15 mm.
- **Rationale:** The machine's parameters dropping back to near-idle suggests a halt in active production processes, potentially for a quality check or a minor adjustment.

#### **6. Final Assembly/Quality Check**
- **Events:** 11, 12
- **Pattern:** Low to moderate readings across all sensors (Temperature: ~25°C, Pressure: 1 bar, Vibration: 5 Hz, Material Flow: 1 unit/s, Tool Position: 20 mm, Energy: ~1.55 kWh).
- **Rationale:** The gentle, stable readings indicate a less intense operation, possibly a final assembly step or a quality inspection where minimal tool engagement is required.
