This is a flowchart (likely a BPMN-style business process diagram) depicting an **order fulfillment workflow** for an e-commerce or retail system. It's structured vertically within a large bordered canvas, with labeled swimlanes (vertical columns) separating responsibilities across roles/systems. Here's a breakdown from top to bottom and left to right:

### Swimlanes (Vertical Divisions)
- **Leftmost**: "Customer" (initiates processes).
- **Next**: "Warehouse" (handles inventory and shipping).
- **Center**: Untitled/blank (core processing steps).
- **Rightmost**: "Payment Gateway" (handles transactions).

### Key Process Flow (Top to Bottom)
1. **Start/Trigger** (top-left, oval): "Customer places order."
   
2. **Validation & Check**:
   - Diamond: "Check inventory"  Branches to "Available" (yes, proceeds) or loops back.
   - Rectangle: "Create order" (under Customer swimlane).

3. **Core Processing** (center):
   - "Check payment"  Diamond decision: "Payment OK?"  If yes, "Place order"; if no, loops back.
   - Parallel gateway (diamond with +) splits into:
     - "Update inventory" (Warehouse swimlane, loops back).
     - "Customer notification" (e.g., email/SMS).

4. **Fulfillment** (bottom):
   - "Pick & pack" (Warehouse).
   - "Ship order"  Connects to "Payment Gateway."
   - Parallel gateway merges paths.

5. **Payment & Completion** (bottom-right):
   - "Process payment" (Payment Gateway).
   - Diamond: "Full payment?"  If no, "Refund"; if yes, loops to "Customer notification."
   - Final oval (bottom-right): "Order complete."

### Additional Elements
- **Loops/Feedback**: Multiple arrows loop back for retries (e.g., inventory checks, payment failures).
- **Gateways**:
  - Parallel (+): Splits/merges concurrent tasks (e.g., inventory update + notification).
  - Exclusive (diamond): Decisions (e.g., "Payment OK?", "Full payment?").
- **Data Objects**: Small documents attached (e.g., to "Create order" and "Place order").
- Arrows indicate directional flow, with some dashed lines possibly denoting messages or async events.

The diagram uses standard flowchart symbols (ovals for start/end, rectangles for tasks, diamonds for decisions/gateways) in a clean, white-background layout with black text and blue accents on some gateways. It models a robust, fault-tolerant process handling inventory, payment, shipping, and notifications.
