To parse this XML and visualize the process, we can use a Python script with the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module to parse the XML and the `graphviz` library to visualize the process.

Here's an example script:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import graphviz

# Parse the XML
tree = ET.parse('bpmn.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

# Create a directed graph
dot = graphviz.Digraph(comment='BPMN Process')

# Add nodes
for task in root.findall('.//task'):
    dot.node(task.attrib['sid'], task.text)

for gateway in root.findall('.//exclusiveGateway'):
    dot.node(gateway.attrib['sid'], gateway.attrib['gatewayDirection'])

for event in root.findall('.//startEvent'):
    dot.node(event.attrib['sid'], 'Start Event')

for event in root.findall('.//endEvent'):
    dot.node(event.attrib['sid'], 'End Event')

# Add edges
for flow in root.findall('.//sequenceFlow'):
    dot.edge(flow.attrib['sourceRef'], flow.attrib['targetRef'])

# Render the graph
dot.format = 'png'
dot.render('bpmn_process', view=True)
```

This script will generate a PNG image named `bpmn_process.png` in the same directory, visualizing the BPMN process.

Note that this script assumes that the XML file is named `bpmn.xml` and is in the same directory as the script. You may need to adjust the file name and path to match your specific use case.

Also, this script uses the `graphviz` library, which is not included in the Python standard library. You may need to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install graphviz
```

If you don't have the `graphviz` library installed on your system, you may need to install it separately. On Ubuntu-based systems, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```
