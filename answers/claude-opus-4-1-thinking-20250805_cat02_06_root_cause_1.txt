## Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Performance

### 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times

After analyzing the event log, I've calculated the total resolution times for each case:

| Case ID | Total Resolution Time | Status |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| 103 | 1 hour 20 minutes |  Fast |
| 101 | 2 hours 15 minutes |  Fast |
| 104 | 24 hours 10 minutes |  Slow |
| 102 | 25 hours 10 minutes |  Slow |
| 105 | 49 hours 5 minutes |  Very Slow |

**Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times**, taking 10-37 times longer than the fastest cases (101 and 103).

### 2. Root Causes of Performance Issues

#### **Primary Factor: Escalations to Level-2 Agents**
- **Cases with escalations (102, 105):** Average resolution time of ~37 hours
- **Cases without escalations (101, 103, 104):** Average resolution time of ~9 hours
- Escalated cases show massive delays between escalation and subsequent investigation:
  - Case 102: 2.5-hour wait after escalation
  - Case 105: 28-hour wait after escalation (over a full day!)

#### **Secondary Factor: Overnight/Cross-Day Delays**
All slow cases (102, 104, 105) span multiple days and show significant delays when work transitions overnight:
- **Investigation to Resolution delays:** 19 hours for cases 102, 104, and 105
- This suggests work stops at end of business day and resumes the next morning
- Case 103 and 101 were completed same-day and avoided these delays

#### **Tertiary Factor: Initial Response Times**
Variable triage response times indicate inconsistent initial handling:
- Best: 5 minutes (Case 103)
- Worst: 40 minutes (Case 104)
- This suggests uneven workload distribution or prioritization issues

### 3. Impact Analysis and Recommendations

#### **How These Factors Increase Cycle Times:**

1. **Escalation Bottleneck:** Level-2 agents appear to be a scarce resource with high queue times, creating a significant bottleneck. The 28-hour wait in Case 105 suggests Level-2 agents may only be available during specific hours or are severely overloaded.

2. **Lack of 24/7 Coverage:** The consistent ~19-hour gaps suggest no overnight support coverage, causing any ticket not resolved by end of day to automatically add an entire night's delay.

3. **Queue Management Issues:** The variation in initial response times and delays between activities suggests poor queue management or lack of real-time monitoring.

#### **Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Implement SLA monitoring with alerts for tickets waiting >2 hours at any stage
   - Create a priority queue for escalated tickets to reduce Level-2 wait times
   - Consider staggered shifts to provide extended coverage hours

2. **Medium-term Solutions:**
   - Increase Level-2 agent capacity or cross-train Level-1 agents for common escalation scenarios
   - Implement automated ticket routing based on complexity to reduce unnecessary escalations
   - Establish clear escalation criteria to prevent premature escalations

3. **Long-term Improvements:**
   - Analyze escalation patterns to identify knowledge gaps in Level-1 training
   - Consider 24/7 support coverage or at least extended hours for critical issues
   - Implement predictive analytics to forecast ticket complexity and pre-assign to appropriate tier

The data clearly shows that **escalations and overnight delays are the primary drivers of poor performance**, with escalated tickets taking 4-6 times longer than non-escalated ones. Addressing these bottlenecks could reduce average resolution time by up to 70%.
