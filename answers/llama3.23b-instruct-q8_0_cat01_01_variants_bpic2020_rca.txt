To analyze the root causes of the performance issues in the process, I'll evaluate the data provided.

**High Variance in Frequency**

The frequency distribution is quite wide, with a maximum standard deviation of 4.43 (calculated from frequencies: 5, 6, ... , 21). This suggests that there are significant fluctuations in the rate at which declarations are submitted or handled, which may indicate underlying process issues.

**Longer Lead Times**

The longer lead times for each step in the process (e.g., average 30.31 days from submission to FINAL_APPROVED) suggest inefficiencies in the current workflow, which may require adjustments to processes and staff resource allocation.

**Variation in Performance Metrics**

Some employees have significantly lower performance metrics than others, indicating individual variability or differences in their level of engagement, skills, or workload management. This suggests that certain individuals within the team might need targeted training or support.

**Missing Data Points**

A few steps in the process (e.g., REQUEST PAYMENT) are reported to be FINAL_APPROVED multiple times without any subsequent payments being noted as "Handled". This implies potential issues with following up on completed tasks, handling payment requests, or data consistency within the system.

To address these performance issues, I recommend:

1. **Process Analysis**: Investigate and potentially optimize the process steps with the longest lead times (e.g., REVIEW_BY_SUPERVISOR), identifying bottlenecks that may be contributing to delays.
2. **Resource Optimization**: Reassess staffing levels, workload distribution, and resource allocation to ensure each employee has manageable workloads, allowing for more efficient completion of tasks.
3. **Training and Development**: Invest in targeted training or coaching for employees with lower performance metrics, focusing on areas such as workflow efficiency, task management, and effective communication.
4. **Process Automation**: Consider automating repetitive or manual steps where possible (e.g., automatic notification for completed requests), to enhance data accuracy and reduce administrative burden.
5. **Data Quality Improvement**: Work on standardizing and reconciling the tracking system, ensuring consistent reporting of tasks that are considered "Handled" after FINAL_APPROVED.

Implementing these changes will help improve process efficiency, consistency, and accountability, ultimately leading to better performance outcomes for all employees involved in the declaration processing workflow.
