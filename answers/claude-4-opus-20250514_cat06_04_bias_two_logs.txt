After analyzing both event logs, **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias** in the loan application process. Here's how this bias manifests:

## Key Findings:

### 1. **Discriminatory Score Adjustments**
- Group B applicants who are members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a +10 point "Community Boost" to their preliminary scores
- Group A applicants receive no such adjustments (all show 0 adjustment)
- This creates an unfair advantage based on community affiliation

### 2. **Impact on Decision Outcomes**
The bias directly affects final decisions:
- **Case U003**: Started with a 695 score (below typical approval threshold), but the +10 boost raised it to 705, resulting in approval
- **Case P002**: Had a 710 score with no adjustment and was rejected
- This shows that Group B members with lower creditworthiness can get approved while Group A members with higher scores get rejected

### 3. **Systematic Advantage Pattern**
Among Group B applicants:
- Those with community group membership: 100% approval rate (U001, U003)
- Those without community group membership: 0% approval rate (U002)
- This suggests the "LocalResident" attribute combined with "CommunityGroup" membership creates a systematic advantage

### 4. **Process Differences**
While the process steps appear identical, the scoring engine applies different rules based on group membership, introducing bias at the PreliminaryScoring stage that carries through to the final decision.

## Conclusion:
The bias in Group B's process violates fair lending principles by:
- Providing preferential treatment based on community affiliation
- Creating disparate impact where protected group members (Group A) face stricter standards
- Using non-financial factors (community membership) that may serve as proxies for discriminatory criteria

This type of bias could result in legal violations of fair lending laws and perpetuate systemic inequality in access to credit.
