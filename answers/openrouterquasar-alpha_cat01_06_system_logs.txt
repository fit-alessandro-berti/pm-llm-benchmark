### Explanation of Process Log Construction:

#### Case Identification:
- **Cases were grouped around distinct files or user tasks**:  
    - All activity where the document is `Document1.docx` is grouped as **CASE_DOC1**, representing one editing session with interruptions and resumptions.  
    - The email reply flow (open email, scroll, reply, send) is grouped as **CASE_EMAIL_ANNUAL_MEETING**.  
    - Viewing and annotating the PDF is a separate review case **CASE_PDF_REVIEW**.  
    - Updating a budget spreadsheet is **CASE_BUDGET_UPDATE**.  
    - Finally, work on `Quarterly_Report.docx` at the start and end is the case **CASE_REPORT_Q4** since the user returns to it after the other tasks.  
  
This grouping represents **user-centric units of work** rather than splitting cases at every window focus.

#### Activity Naming & Abstraction:
- **Raw low-level actions** were translated to **meaningful higher-level activity names**, such as:
  - `FOCUS` becomes "Open Document" or "Resume Editing" depending on context.
  - `TYPING` becomes "Write Content," "Write Reply," or "Edit Spreadsheet."
  - `SAVE` to "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet."
  - `SWITCH` indicates a transition but was included if it represented a switch starting a new unit of work ("Switch to Email").
  - `CLICK` with "Reply" becomes "Reply to Email"; with "Send" becomes "Send Email."
  - `SCROLL` within email or PDF indicates "Read Email" or "Review PDF."
  - PDF highlight becomes "Highlight Key Content."
  - `CLOSE` represents "Close Document."

#### Additional Attributes:
- The log includes **Application** and **Document/Window Title** as easy references.
- Text content typed or highlighted is added to “Additional Info” for domain insights.

### Summary:
- This process event log narrates **multiple overlapping user tasks** with **interleaved application use**.  
- Cases are organized by **document/email focus** and reflect user **work units** interrupted and resumed (like writing then switching to email, then returning).  
- Activity names provide standardized, analyst-friendly steps.  
- This transformation enables process discovery, conformance checking, or performance analysis centered on **actual user activities**, not just raw system events.
