Process mining, or process mining analysis, is a field of computer science that studies patterns and trends within business processes. This approach aims to uncover complex behaviors in organizations by analyzing data on processes over time.

### Process Cubes

In the context of process mining, process cubes are an extension of traditional flowcharts where each node represents a step or event in the process. Each cube has attributes such as duration, frequency, and impact (meaningful events). These attributes are derived from the data captured during process simulation.

The key difference between process mining and process cubing is that the latter focuses more on interpreting complex processes through visual representations of the relationships among steps and outcomes. While traditional flowcharts can help visualize the progression of a process, they lack the detailed insights into individual steps' behaviors, durations, impacts, and frequencies provided by process cubes.

### Benefits of Process Cubes in Multi-Dimensional Processes

1. **Deep Insights**: Process cubes provide a deeper understanding of how processes evolve over time, identifying patterns and trends not visible in traditional flowcharts.
2. **Complex Patterns**: They can detect and highlight more complex behaviors that might be missed by simple visualization tools.
3. **Real-Time Analysis**: The visual nature of process cubes allows for real-time analysis, making it suitable for monitoring and understanding how processes change over time without needing to stop the actual execution.

### How Process Cubes Differ from Traditional Process Mining

While both traditional process mining and process cubing use data visualization, their main focus is different. Process mining focuses on extracting insights from data through patterns and trends that are hidden within complex business processes. Process cubing, in contrast, aims to visualize these complex interactions in a more intuitive way.

### Conclusion

Process cubes represent an important evolution in the field of process mining by providing a new tool for understanding multi-dimensional processes in organizations. By combining visual insights with detailed data analysis capabilities, they offer a powerful toolset for process improvement and optimization strategies within businesses. The adoption of both traditional process mining techniques and process cubing can complement each other to create a comprehensive approach to the study of business processes.
