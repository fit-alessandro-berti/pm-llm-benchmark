### Rationale for Added Constraints:

1. **Added `ManualReview` to `existence`**: Ensures that the manual review activity is always present in any valid trace, preventing fully automated decisions on sensitive cases.

2. **Coexistence constraints between sensitive attribute checks (`CheckApplicantRace`, etc.) and `ManualReview`**: Forces a manual review to occur whenever a sensitive attribute is examined, preventing automated bias by ensuring human oversight is triggered.

3. **Coexistence between decisions (`Approve`, `Reject`) and `ManualReview`**: Ensures that *any* final decision (positive or negative) is accompanied by a manual review, eliminating one-step automated approvals/rejections that may reflect hidden bias.

4. **Response constraints from sensitive checks to `BiasMitigationCheck`**: Requires that any detection of a sensitive attribute (e.g., race, gender, age) must be followed by a formal bias mitigation step, ensuring procedural fairness before any decision.

5. **Succession constraints from `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` to decisions**: Forces decisions to be preceded by fairness interventions, making it impossible to bypass due diligence.

6. **Non-succession constraints from sensitive checks to `Reject`**: Explicitly prohibits the direct transition from a sensitive attribute check to a rejection — a common pattern in biased systems. This prevents “immediate negative outcomes” after detecting protected attributes.

Together, these constraints transform the process from a potentially discriminatory, automated pipeline into a **fairness-by-design** workflow: sensitive attributes trigger mandatory human review and mitigation steps, and decisions can only occur after these safeguards are completed. This ensures auditability, consistency, and compliance with anti-discrimination principles.
