### Analysis of Both Models

**Contextual Recap of the Normative Hire-to-Retire Process**  
The "Hire-to-Retire" process generally follows a logical sequence of steps to ensure that a new employee is properly selected, hired, integrated, and compensated. A typical normative sequence might look like this:

1. **Post Job Advertisement**
2. **Screen Candidates**
3. **Conduct Interviews**
4. **Make Hiring Decision**
5. **Onboard Employee**
6. **Add Employee to Payroll**
7. **Close the Case**

This sequence ensures a logical and compliant flow. For instance, you must identify candidates before interviewing them, interview them before making a hiring decision, make a decision before onboarding, and ensure the new hire is added to payroll before finalizing the process.

### Model 1 Analysis

**Model 1 Structure:**
- Activities: Post → Screen → [Decide, Interview in parallel] → Onboard → Payroll → Close
- Partial Orders:
  - Post_Job_Ad precedes Screen_Candidates.
  - Screen_Candidates precedes both Make_Hiring_Decision and Conduct_Interviews.
  - After the decision, Onboard_Employee → Add_to_Payroll → Close_Case.

**Identified Anomalies in Model 1:**
1. **Out-of-Order Decision vs. Interviews:**  
   The model places "Make_Hiring_Decision" and "Conduct_Interviews" as parallel successors to "Screen_Candidates." In a normative process, interviews inform the hiring decision. Here, the decision activity could technically be completed before or independently of the interviews, which is logically flawed.  
   - **Severity:** High. Making a hiring decision before conducting interviews undermines the fundamental logic of candidate evaluation.

2. **Strict Sequencing Otherwise Maintained:**  
   After the decision (whenever it occurs), the flow returns to a normative sequence: Onboard → Payroll → Close. There are no loops, conditions, or skip options that would allow essential steps to be bypassed. All key steps (onboarding and payroll) are mandatory.

**Overall Assessment of Model 1:**
- The main anomaly is the reversed/pre-parallelized logic concerning interviews and the decision. However, despite this significant logical flaw, the model still ensures that all critical post-decision steps (onboarding, payroll, closing) occur in a proper sequence and are not skipped.

### Model 2 Analysis

**Model 2 Structure:**
- Activities: Post → [Screen, Interview in parallel] → Decide → Loop Onboarding → XOR Payroll/Skip → Close
- Operators used:
  - **Loop (Onboarding):** Onboard can be repeated multiple times or even be skipped due to the loop’s structure combined with a silent transition.
  - **XOR (Payroll):** After onboarding, you can either add the employee to payroll or skip this step entirely.

**Identified Anomalies in Model 2:**
1. **Parallel Screening and Interviewing:**  
   Similar to Model 1’s issue, screening candidates and conducting interviews happen in parallel or are partially ordered, suggesting interviews could occur before screening is complete—or vice versa. Ideally, screening narrows down candidates before interviews.  
   - **Severity:** Moderate. While not as conceptually severe as deciding before interviews, it still undermines process integrity.

2. **Loop in Onboarding with Potential Skips:**  
   The loop operator around onboarding allows multiple iterations of onboarding or skipping it altogether. Skipping onboarding contradicts the purpose of a hiring process where the new employee must be integrated into the company.  
   - **Severity:** High. Not onboarding a hired employee is a direct violation of standard practice.

3. **XOR on Payroll Step (Payroll vs. Skip):**  
   The XOR operator allows the addition to payroll to be optional. This could result in a hired employee not being paid or recognized in the payroll system—a severe compliance and logical issue.  
   - **Severity:** Very High. Failing to add a hired employee to payroll fundamentally breaks the process’s legal and operational requirements.

**Overall Assessment of Model 2:**
- While it enforces a hiring decision before onboarding, it introduces more severe anomalies by allowing critical steps (onboarding, payroll) to be bypassed entirely.
- The presence of a loop structure allowing repeated or skipped onboarding and an XOR operator allowing payroll to be skipped completely are grave violations of standard HR and operational logic.

### Comparison and Decision

**Which Model More Closely Aligns with a Normative Process?**  
- **Model 1** only has one major anomaly: the lack of strict ordering between interviews and the hiring decision. However, all critical steps post-decision (onboarding, adding to payroll) are guaranteed to occur.
- **Model 2**, on the other hand, introduces multiple severe anomalies:
  - Critical steps like onboarding and adding the employee to the payroll may be skipped.
  - Screening and interviews are not properly ordered.
  - The loop and XOR constructs introduce scenarios where the logical integrity of the process is severely compromised.

Given these points, **Model 1** aligns more closely with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process. While the order of interviews and decision-making is flawed, the integrity of post-hiring steps is maintained. By contrast, Model 2’s anomalies allow fundamental, essential activities to be skipped, undermining the process’s legality, compliance, and logical coherence.

### Conclusion

**Model 1** is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process than **Model 2**, because its anomalies are less severe and do not allow critical steps like onboarding or payroll to be bypassed. Model 2’s structure, with loops and XOR operators that can skip essential steps, severely compromises the process’s correctness and integrity.
