Based on the event log, the POWL model that captures these relationships can be constructed as follows:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities as transitions
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

# Define the loop for IQC
iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])
iqc_loop.label = "IQC loop"

# Define the loop for TST and RT
tst_rt_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])
tst_rt_loop.label = "TST and RT loop"

# Define the XOR operator for LB
xor_lb = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, SilentTransition()])
xor_lb.label = "LB XOR"

# Define the partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, iqc_loop, AS, xor_lb, DP, D])
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(OR, QS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, iqc_loop)
root.order.add_edge(QS, iqc_loop)
root.order.add_edge(iqc_loop, AS)
root.order.add_edge(AS, xor_lb)
root.order.add_edge(xor_lb, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
root.order.add_edge(tst_rt_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, xor_lb)

# Print the POWL model
print(root)
```

This POWL model represents the complex process with the following features:

*   **Activities**: Each activity is defined as a transition with a label (e.g., "OR", "MS", "QS", etc.).
*   **Loops**: There are two loops in the process: one for the "IQC" activity and another for the "TST" and "RT" activities. These loops are represented using the `Operator.LOOP` operator.
*   **XOR Operator**: The "LB" activity is connected to a silent transition using the `Operator.XOR` operator, allowing for the possibility of skipping the labeling step.
*   **Partial Order**: The partial order between activities is defined using the `StrictPartialOrder` class. The `add_edge` method is used to specify the order between activities. For example, the "IQC" loop depends on the completion of both "MS" and "QS", and the "AS" activity depends on the completion of the "IQC" loop.

This POWL model captures the complex relationships between activities in the event log, including loops, XOR operators, and partial order.
