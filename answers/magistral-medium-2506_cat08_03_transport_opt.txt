### **Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels**

#### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

##### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To create a cohesive event log for process mining, we must integrate data from multiple sources (GPS, scanners, dispatch, maintenance) while addressing challenges such as:
- **Different Granularities:** GPS data may have frequent timestamps, while scanner events are sparser.
- **Data Alignment:** Synchronizing timestamps across systems (e.g., GPS logs vs. scanner events).
- **Missing or Inconsistent Data:** Some events (e.g., failed delivery attempts) may not always be logged.
- **Case ID Definition:** A meaningful case could be a "Vehicle-Day" (e.g., `V12-20241205`), capturing all events for a vehicle on a given day.

**Steps for Integration:**
1. **Normalize timestamps** across systems to a unified timezone.
2. **Merge data sources** by linking events via shared keys (e.g., `Vehicle ID`, `Driver ID`, `Package ID`).
3. **Enrich events** with derived attributes (e.g., distance between stops, idle time between deliveries).
4. **Handle missing data** via interpolation (e.g., estimating missing GPS positions) or flagging incomplete cases.

##### **Process Discovery**
Using algorithms like **Alpha Miner** or **Inductive Miner**, we can discover the actual end-to-end delivery process, visualizing:
- **Main path:** Depot  Deliveries (successful/failed)  Return to depot.
- **Variants:** Routes with detours, unscheduled stops, or maintenance interruptions.
- **Loops:** Repeated delivery attempts for failed deliveries.
- **Parallel flows:** Multiple deliveries in sequence vs. clustered stops.

**Visualization Tools:**
- A **process map** showing the most common paths and deviations.
- A **frequency heatmap** of delivery stop durations to identify outliers.

##### **Conformance Checking**
We compare the **discovered process** against the **planned routes** from the dispatch system to identify:
- **Sequence deviations:** Deliveries not following the planned route order.
- **Unplanned stops:** Unexpected idling (e.g., driver breaks, traffic delays).
- **Timing anomalies:** Excessive dwell time at stops or between stops.
- **Failed deliveries:** High rebound rates requiring rerouting.

**Techniques:**
- **Alignment-based conformance checking** to quantify deviations.
- **Token replay analysis** to identify where actual behavior diverges from the model.

#### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

##### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
We derive these from the event log:
1. **On-Time Delivery Rate:** % of successful deliveries within scheduled time windows.
   - *Calculation:* `(Successful deliveries on time) / (Total deliveries planned)`
2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop:**
   - *Calculation:* `(Sum of dwell times at customer locations) / (Number of stops)`
3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:**
   - *Calculation:* `(Total travel time between stops) / (Total service time at stops)`
4. **Fuel Consumption per km/package:**
   - *Calculation:* `(Total fuel used per route) / (Distance traveled + packages delivered)`
5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate:**
   - *Calculation:* `(Operational time) / (Total shift time)`
6. **Failed Delivery Rate:**
   - *Calculation:* `(Failed deliveries) / (Total delivery attempts)`

##### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**
- **Performance Spectrum Analysis:** Identify slowest delivery routes or time slots (e.g., midday traffic congestion).
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-efficiency routes (fast delivery completion) vs. low-efficiency ones.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Identify stops with unusually long service times (e.g., customer delays, loading issues).
- **Throughput Analysis:** Check if certain vehicles or drivers consistently take longer.
- **Spatial Clustering:** Heatmaps of frequent delays (e.g., traffic hotspots).

**Example Insight:**
If a route consistently shows long dwell times at certain stops, it may indicate unoptimized sequencing or customer accessibility issues.

#### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Potential root causes and corresponding process mining analyses:

| **Root Cause Hypothesis**          | **Process Mining Technique**                          | **Data Evidence to Validate**                          |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Suboptimal route planning**     | Compare planned vs. actual routes (conformance)       | High sequence deviations in certain areas              |
| **Traffic congestion impact**      | Correlate GPS speed data with delivery delays         | Frequent low-speed events during afternoon shifts      |
| **High service time variability**  | Analyze dwell time distributions per stop             | Some customer locations have 2-3x longer service times |
| **Vehicle breakdowns**             | Check maintenance logs against unscheduled stops      | Vehicles with frequent breakdowns have higher delays   |
| **Failed deliveries**              | Trace failed delivery events and subsequent reattempts | High rebound rates increase total distance traveled    |
| **Driver behavior differences**    | Compare driver performance metrics (e.g., idle time)   | Some drivers take longer breaks or slower routes       |

#### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

| **Strategy**                          | **Targeted Inefficiency**               | **Root Cause Addressed**            | **Supporting Data Insight**                          | **Expected KPI Impact**                     |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **1. Dynamic Routing Adjustments**    | Long travel times between stops         | Static route planning, traffic      | GPS data shows recurrent congestion zones             | Reduce travel time, improve on-time rate   |
| **2. Failed Delivery Reduction**      | High rebound rates                      | Customer unavailability             | Scanner logs show frequent failed attempts late-day   | Lower fuel costs, higher first-time success|
| **3. Predictive Maintenance**         | Unscheduled vehicle downtime            | Breakdowns during shifts            | Maintenance logs correlate with vehicle age/mileage   | Lower maintenance costs, fewer delays      |

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Dynamic Routing:**
   - Use real-time traffic data + historical patterns to adjust routes mid-shift.
   - Prioritize clustered deliveries to minimize travel distance.

2. **Failed Delivery Reduction:**
   - Optimize delivery time windows based on customer availability trends.
   - Implement proactive customer notifications (e.g., SMS confirmations).

3. **Predictive Maintenance:**
   - Use event logs to predict breakdowns (e.g., vehicles with frequent low-speed alerts may need servicing).

#### **5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring**

**Constraint Considerations:**
- Driver working hours: Ensure route optimizations don’t violate labor laws.
- Vehicle capacities: Avoid overloading by analyzing package-weight logs.
- Customer time windows: Balance flexibility with route efficiency.

**Monitoring Plan:**
- **Real-time dashboards** tracking:
  - Current route adherence vs. planned routes.
  - Live traffic impact on delivery ETAs.
  - Vehicle health alerts (e.g., prolonged idle times may indicate issues).
- **Periodic process mining reviews:**
  - Update process models monthly to detect new inefficiencies.
  - A/B test optimizations (e.g., compare dynamic vs. static routing performance).
