We are going to create two POWL models for the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions.

 First, we define the common activities (transitions) that appear in both models:

 - ReceiveApplication
 - DataCompletenessCheck
 - RequestMoreInfo (for the loop when data is missing)
 - SkillAssessment
 - CulturalFitCheck
 - CommunityAffiliationCheck (only in the first model with potential unfairness)
 - ManagerialReview
 - FinalDecision

 We also note that the process has:
 - A loop for data completeness (after initial resume parsing, if data is missing, we request more info and then check again)
 - A sequence of steps: ReceiveApplication, then the loop for data completeness, then SkillAssessment, then the cultural fit evaluation (which in the first model has an XOR branch), then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

 Let's break down:

 1. The first part is a loop for data completeness:
    - We have a StrictPartialOrder for the loop structure. The loop in POWL is defined as * ( A, B ) meaning: do A, then either exit or do B and then A again.

    In our case, the loop is for the data completeness check. We can model it as:
        Loop:
          A = DataCompletenessCheck
          B = RequestMoreInfo

    So, we do DataCompletenessCheck, then if we need to request more info, we do RequestMoreInfo and then DataCompletenessCheck again.

 2. After the loop, we have the SkillAssessment.

 3. Then, we have an XOR branch for the cultural fit evaluation in the first model (with potential unfairness):
        XOR ( CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck )
    This means that either the standard CulturalFitCheck is done OR the CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives an advantage) is done.

 4. In the second model (without unfairness), we remove the XOR and have only the CulturalFitCheck.

 5. Then, both models proceed to ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

 6. Also, note that the process starts with ReceiveApplication, which is before the loop.

 We structure the entire process as a partial order:

    ReceiveApplication -> (loop for data completeness) -> SkillAssessment -> (XOR in first model, or just CulturalFitCheck in second) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

 Let's create the two models step by step.

 First, we define the common transitions.

Based on the hiring process description, I'll create two POWL models that reflect the workflow with and without potential unfairness in the cultural fit evaluation stage.

**POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness: DataCompletenessCheck, then either exit or RequestMoreInfo and repeat
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, 
                                     children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR choice between standard cultural fit and community affiliation check
cultural_evaluation_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR,
                                      children=[StandardCulturalFit, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Main partial order
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop, 
                                       SkillAssessment, cultural_evaluation_xor, 
                                       ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the sequence: ReceiveApplication -> Loop -> SkillAssessment -> XOR -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_evaluation_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_evaluation_xor, ManagerialReview)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**POWL Model Without Unfairness:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities (same as before, but no CommunityAffiliationCheck)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit")  # Now this is the only cultural evaluation
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness (same as before)
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP,
                                     children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Main partial order - no XOR branch for cultural evaluation
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop,
                                     SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFit,
                                     ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the sequence: ReceiveApplication -> Loop -> SkillAssessment -> StandardCulturalFit -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision
root_fair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(StandardCulturalFit, ManagerialReview)
root_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Key Differences:**

1. **Unfair Model:** Contains an XOR branch (`cultural_evaluation_xor`) that allows different paths:
   - `StandardCulturalFit` (standard evaluation)
   - `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (path that provides preferential treatment)

2. **Fair Model:** Has a straightforward sequence where all applicants go through the same `StandardCulturalFit` evaluation, eliminating the potential bias from community affiliations.

Both models maintain the same core structure:
- Initial application receipt
- Data completeness loop (check and potentially request more information)
- Skill assessment
- Managerial review and final decision

The only difference is in how the cultural fit evaluation is handled, which directly addresses the potential unfairness described in the problem statement.
