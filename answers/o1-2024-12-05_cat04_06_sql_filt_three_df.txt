Below is one possible DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the described task. It uses window functions to identify the required sequence of activities within each case, filters for those that meet the timing condition, and then excludes all events from those cases.

**Explanation:**

1. Use a CTE (Common Table Expression) to:
   - Partition the `event_log` by `case_id` and order by `timestamp`.
   - Generate columns using `LAG()` to check the previous two activities and the previous timestamp for the current event. 
   - This will help identify if the current row (event) is part of the desired triple sequence: ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order').
   
2. Within the CTE, filter to find the exact cases that have the sequence:
   ```
   Approve Purchase Requisition -> Create Order -> Confirm Order
   ```
   in immediate succession, and where the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is greater than 5 days.

3. Use the identified `case_id`s from step 2 to exclude all events belonging to these cases from the final result.

**Final Query:**

```sql
WITH seq AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity_1,
        LAG(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity_2,
        LAG(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp_1
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM seq
    WHERE activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND prev_activity_1 = 'Create Order'
      AND prev_activity_2 = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND timestamp - prev_timestamp_1 > INTERVAL 5 DAY
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**How it Works:**

- The `seq` CTE tags each event with the previous one and two activities and the previous eventâ€™s timestamp.
- The filtering in the subquery identifies all cases that have the specified sequence and meet the timing condition.
- The outer query then returns all events for all cases **not** in that filtered set, effectively excluding all events from any case that matched both the sequence and time conditions.
