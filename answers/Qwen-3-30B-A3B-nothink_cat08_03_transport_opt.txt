# **Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels: Analyzing and Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Operations**

As a Process Mining Consultant specializing in logistics and transportation, I will provide a **comprehensive, data-driven approach** to analyze Speedy Parcels’ operations, identify inefficiencies, and recommend actionable optimization strategies. The analysis will be structured around the five key areas outlined in the scenario.

---

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### **Data Integration and Preprocessing**

To create a **cohesive event log** suitable for process mining, the following steps would be taken:

- **Data Aggregation:** Consolidate data from GPS trackers, driver scanners, dispatch systems, and maintenance logs into a unified event log. Each event must be timestamped and associated with a **Case ID** (e.g., Vehicle-Day, Package ID, or Customer ID).
- **Standardization:** Normalize event types (e.g., “Arrive Customer,” “Delivery Success”) and ensure consistent naming conventions across sources.
- **Event Mapping:** Map GPS events (e.g., “Low Speed Detected”) to scanner events (e.g., “Arrive Customer”) to create a timeline of activities.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Address missing timestamps, location data, or activity types using imputation techniques or by flagging as anomalies.
- **Contextual Enrichment:** Add metadata such as vehicle type, driver ID, package type, and time of day to enable more detailed analysis.

**Challenges:**
- **Data Fragmentation:** Different systems may use different timestamps, formats, or identifiers.
- **Event Ambiguity:** Some events (e.g., “Unscheduled Stop”) may be ambiguous or lack context.
- **Data Quality Issues:** Missing or inconsistent data can affect the accuracy of process discovery and conformance checks.

### **Process Discovery and Visualization**

Using process discovery algorithms such as **Alpha Miner**, **Heuristics Miner**, or **Inductive Miner**, I would:
- **Visualize the Actual Process:** Reconstruct the end-to-end delivery process from **Depot Departure** to **Depot Return**, including:
  - Travel time
  - Delivery attempts
  - Failed deliveries
  - Maintenance stops
  - Traffic delays
- **Identify Variants:** Discover different execution paths, such as:
  - Standard delivery routes
  - Deviations due to traffic
  - Extra stops for failed deliveries
  - Emergency maintenance stops

### **Conformance Checking Against Planned Routes**

- **Model Alignment:** Align the discovered process model with the **planned routes** from the dispatch system.
- **Deviation Detection:**
  - **Sequence Deviations:** Compare the actual sequence of activities (e.g., “Arrive Customer” before “Depart Customer”) with the planned order.
  - **Unplanned Stops:** Identify any stops not included in the dispatch plan.
  - **Timing Differences:** Calculate the **deviation in time** between planned and actual durations for each activity.
- **Tools:** Use **Conformance Checking** techniques (e.g., using ProM or Disco) to highlight deviations and assess their frequency and impact.

## **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

The following KPIs would be calculated from the event log to assess performance and identify inefficiencies:

| KPI | Description | Calculation Method |
|-----|-------------|--------------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | % of deliveries made within the customer’s requested time window | (Number of on-time deliveries / Total deliveries) × 100 |
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | Average time spent at each stop (including arrival, service, and departure) | Sum of service times / Total stops |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | Ratio of travel time to service time per delivery | (Total travel time / Total service time) |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | Fuel efficiency per delivery | (Total fuel used / Total km driven) / (Total packages delivered) |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | % of time a vehicle is actively in use (excluding idle time) | (Active time / Total shift duration) × 100 |
| **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays** | Number and time spent in traffic per route | Count and duration of low-speed events or traffic alerts |
| **Rate of Failed Deliveries** | % of failed delivery attempts | (Number of failed deliveries / Total deliveries) × 100 |

### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**

- **Bottleneck Detection:** Use **Bottleneck Analysis** to identify where delays are concentrated (e.g., specific stops, routes, or times of day).
- **Resource Utilization Analysis:** Identify overused or underused drivers or vehicles.
- **Path Analysis:** Use **Process Tree or Petri Net** models to identify the most frequently traversed paths and where delays occur.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Analyze **dwell times** at customer locations to detect inefficient service times or customer unavailability.
- **Cluster Analysis:** Group routes by **traffic patterns**, **delivery density**, or **driver performance** to find common bottlenecks.

**Quantifying Impact:**
- Calculate **average delay per route**, **cost per failed delivery**, and **fuel waste due to idling or traffic**.
- Use **statistical analysis** (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests) to determine if differences in performance between routes, drivers, or vehicles are statistically significant.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes**

| Root Cause | Description | Process Mining Insight |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Suboptimal Route Planning** | Static routes may not account for traffic or delivery density | Compare planned vs. actual routes; identify deviations |
| **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations** | Overestimation or underestimation of travel times | Analyze travel time vs. actual driving time; detect patterns |
| **Traffic Congestion Patterns** | Specific times or locations with recurring delays | Correlate GPS speed data with traffic alerts and delivery times |
| **High Variability in Service Time** | Inconsistent time spent at customer locations | Analyze dwell times and delivery success rates |
| **Vehicle Breakdowns During Shifts** | Unplanned maintenance stops reduce productivity | Correlate maintenance logs with delivery delays and idle times |
| **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences** | Inefficient driving or customer interaction | Compare performance metrics (e.g., time per stop) across drivers |
| **Failed Deliveries Requiring Re-delivery** | Increased fuel and labor costs | Analyze failed delivery patterns and re-delivery frequency |

### **Process Mining Techniques for Validation**

- **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes/drivers to identify differences in behavior or efficiency.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Use **correlation matrices** to link traffic data with delays, or service time with delivery success.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Identify if certain stops consistently take longer than expected.
- **Event Sequence Analysis:** Detect if certain sequences (e.g., multiple failed deliveries in a row) are more common in certain routes.
