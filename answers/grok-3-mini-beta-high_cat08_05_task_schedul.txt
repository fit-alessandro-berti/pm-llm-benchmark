4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

I must demonstrate expertise in process mining and manufacturing scheduling. The response should be data-driven, using insights from the MES event logs.

Key elements from the scenario:

- High-mix, low-volume job shop with unique job routings.

- Sequence-dependent setup times.

- Disruptions like machine breakdowns and urgent jobs.

- Current issues: high tardiness, high WIP, unpredictable lead times, inefficient resource utilization.

- MES event logs provide detailed data on events, timings, resources, etc.

For each section, I need to be in-depth and specific.

**Section 1: Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

- Use process mining to reconstruct the actual flow. Process mining involves discovering, analyzing, and improving processes based on event logs. I can use techniques like process discovery (e.g., alpha algorithm, heuristic miner) to create a process model from the logs.

- Specific metrics:

  - Job flow times, lead times, makespan: Calculate from timestamps in the log. Flow time is from job release to completion, lead time might be similar or from order to delivery, makespan is for the entire shop or a job.

  - Task waiting times: From queue entry to task start events.

  - Resource utilization: Calculate percentage of time a resource is busy vs. idle. Break down into productive, setup, and idle times using event types.

  - Sequence-dependent setup times: Analyze the log to find setup durations based on the previous job. Use data mining to correlate setup time with job pairs or attributes.

  - Schedule adherence and tardiness: Compare actual completion times with due dates. Calculate lateness, tardiness frequency.

  - Bottleneck resources: Use utilization metrics and queue times to find machines with high utilization and long queues.

  - Poor prioritization: Analyze jobs that are late vs. on-time, see if high-priority jobs are delayed.

  - Suboptimal sequencing: Look at setup times; if sequencing increases setups, it's inefficient.

  - Starvation: Downstream machines idle while upstream queues build.

  - WIP bullwhip effect: Analyze WIP levels over time for variability.

- Use process mining: Bottleneck analysis tools, variant analysis (compare paths of on-time and late jobs), resource contention by looking at overlapping queue times.

**Section 3: Root Cause Analysis**

  - No real-time visibility.

  - Inaccurate estimations.

  - Poor handling of setups.

  - Lack of coordination.

  - Inadequate disruption response.

- How process mining helps: By analyzing the data, we can see if delays are due to scheduling (e.g., wrong rule choice) or external factors (e.g., frequent breakdowns). Use correlation analysis, root cause analysis techniques in process mining.

**Section 4: Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

- Propose three strategies:

### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

To address the challenges at Precision Parts Inc., the first step is to use process mining on the MES event logs to reconstruct and analyze the actual flow of jobs and tasks. Process mining is a powerful technique that extracts knowledge from event logs to discover, monitor, and improve processes. By applying process mining algorithms to the detailed event log (which includes timestamps, event types, case IDs, activities, resources, and other attributes), we can create a digital twin of the shop floor's operations. This involves importing the log into a process mining tool (e.g., ProM, Celonis, or Disco) and using discovery algorithms to generate a process model that visualizes the sequence of events, such as job releases, queue entries, setup starts/ends, task starts/ends, and disruptions.

#### Reconstructing the Actual Flow of Jobs and Tasks
- **Process Discovery:** I would start with process discovery techniques, such as the Heuristic Miner or Inductive Miner, to automatically generate a process model from the event log. This model would capture the actual sequences of activities for each job (e.g., Job Released  Queue Entry (Cutting)  Setup Start  Task Start (Cutting)  Task End  Queue Entry (Milling), etc.). By grouping events by Case ID (Job ID), we can reconstruct individual job flows and identify common routing patterns across jobs. For instance, the log snippet shows JOB-7001 moving from Cutting to Milling, but process mining would reveal variations in routings (e.g., some jobs skip certain tasks or have different machine assignments).
  
- **Trace and Variant Analysis:** To handle the high variability in job routings, I would perform trace clustering to group similar job flows (e.g., jobs with similar sequences of operations). This would help identify dominant process variants and anomalies, such as jobs that experience frequent rerouting due to disruptions. For example, analyzing the log could reveal how priority changes (e.g., JOB-7005's upgrade to "High (Urgent)") cause deviations in the planned sequence.

- **Temporal Analysis:** Using timestamp data, I would reconstruct the timeline of events to map the flow over time. This includes calculating inter-event durations (e.g., time between Task End on one machine and Queue Entry on the next) to understand handoffs between work centers. Process mining tools can visualize this as a timeline or Gantt chart, highlighting delays and bottlenecks.

#### Specific Process Mining Techniques and Metrics for Key Aspects
Process mining provides quantitative metrics by aggregating data from the event log. Below, I outline the techniques and metrics I would use to quantify the specified performance aspects:

- **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
  - **Techniques:** Use process mining's performance analysis features, such as cycle time calculation and distribution fitting. For each job, flow time is computed as the difference between the "Job Released" and "Job Completed" events (not explicitly shown in the snippet but inferable from task end events). Lead time could be defined as the time from job release to actual completion, while makespan is the total time from the first job release to the last job completion in a period.
  - **Metrics:** 
    - Flow time distribution: Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles (e.g., 90th percentile for worst-case scenarios) for each job. For example, from the log, JOB-7001's flow time up to Milling queue entry is about 2.7 hours, but full analysis would cover the entire job.
    - Lead time: Compare actual lead time to planned lead time (derived from due dates or initial estimates). Use histograms or box plots to show distributions, identifying skewness (e.g., long tails indicating frequent delays).
    - Makespan: Aggregate across all jobs in a day/week to find average makespan and variability. This helps quantify overall shop efficiency.
    - **Process Mining Insight:** Apply conformance checking to compare actual flows against a normative model (e.g., ideal routing), revealing deviations that contribute to extended times.

- **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times) at Each Work Center/Machine:**
  - **Techniques:** Focus on "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events to calculate waiting times. Process mining tools can use bottleneck analysis to identify machines with high waiting times.
  - **Metrics:** 
    - Average queue time per machine: For CUT-01 in the log, waiting time for JOB-7001 is from 08:30:40 to 09:15:22 (44.7 minutes). Aggregate this across all jobs to find mean, max, and standard deviation per resource.
    - Queue length over time: Use event log aggregation to plot cumulative queue sizes, identifying periods of congestion (e.g., high WIP buildup).
    - **Process Mining Insight:** Social network analysis can show how waiting times propagate between machines, e.g., long queues at Cutting delaying Milling.

- **Resource Utilization (Machine and Operator):**
  - **Techniques:** Analyze resource logs (e.g., "Task Start/End" events) to compute utilization. Break down time into categories: productive (task processing), setup, idle, and breakdown.
  - **Metrics:** 
    - Utilization percentage: (Productive time + Setup time) / Total available time. For MILL-02, a breakdown from 11:05:15 to (assumed end) reduces utilization. Calculate for each resource, e.g., CUT-01's utilization from the log snippet includes setup (23.5 min) and processing (66.4 min).
    - Idle time: Time between task ends and starts or during breakdowns. Use histograms to show idle periods.
    - Setup time proportion: Total setup time / Total machine time, to highlight setup overhead.
    - **Process Mining Insight:** Use organizational mining to correlate operator assignments (e.g., OP-105) with utilization, identifying operator bottlenecks.

- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
  - **Techniques:** Analyze "Setup Start/End" events, cross-referencing with the previous job on the same machine (e.g., JOB-7001's setup on CUT-01 follows JOB-6998). Use data mining within process mining (e.g., decision trees or regression) to model setup time as a function of job attributes (e.g., material type, size) and sequence.
  - **Metrics:** 
    - Setup time by job pair: Calculate average setup time for specific transitions (e.g., from JOB-6998 to JOB-7001). Cluster jobs by attributes to find patterns, e.g., setups are longer when switching between dissimilar jobs.
    - Setup time variance: Compare planned (e.g., 20 min) vs. actual (e.g., 23.5 min) durations, and quantify the impact of sequence on total setup time.
    - **Process Mining Insight:** Apply sequence mining to discover frequent itemsets of job transitions and their associated setup times, enabling prediction of setup durations based on historical data.

- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
  - **Techniques:** Compare actual completion times (from "Task End" or inferred job completion) with due dates. Use conformance checking against a planned schedule (if derivable from logs or external data).
  - **Metrics:** 
    - Lateness: Actual completion time - Due date. Calculate mean lateness, tardiness frequency (proportion of jobs late), and magnitude (e.g., average delay in days).
    - Adherence rate: Percentage of tasks/jobs completed on or before due date. For example, if JOB-7001's due date is 2025-04-28, track if it meets intermediate milestones.
    - **Process Mining Insight:** Variant analysis can compare on-time vs. late job traces, identifying common paths leading to delays.

- **Impact of Disruptions (Breakdowns, Priority Changes):**
  - **Techniques:** Identify disruption events (e.g., "Breakdown Start" for MILL-02, "Priority Change" for JOB-7005) and use correlation analysis to link them to KPI changes. Process mining can detect deviations caused by these events.
  - **Metrics:** 
    - Disruption frequency and duration: Count breakdowns per resource and average downtime. For priority changes, track how often they occur and their effect on queue times.
    - KPI impact: Calculate changes in flow time or utilization before/after disruptions. For instance, MILL-02's breakdown might increase waiting times for downstream tasks.
    - **Process Mining Insight:** Use root cause analysis in process mining to trace disruption effects, e.g., a breakdown leading to a cascade of delays.

By applying these techniques, we gain a holistic view of the shop floor dynamics, quantifying inefficiencies and setting the stage for diagnosis.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Based on the process mining analysis, I would diagnose key pathologies in the current scheduling approach, which relies on simplistic, local dispatching rules (e.g., FCFS and EDD). These rules lack global optimization and adaptability, leading to the issues of high tardiness, WIP, and inefficient resource use. Process mining provides evidence through data-driven insights, such as bottleneck analysis, variant comparison, and resource contention detection.

#### Key Pathologies and Evidence from Process Mining
- **Bottleneck Resources and Their Impact:**
  - **Pathology:** Certain machines (e.g., CNC Milling or Lathing) act as bottlenecks, causing high queue times and reduced throughput. This is exacerbated by sequence-dependent setups and disruptions.
  - **Evidence:** Process mining's bottleneck analysis (e.g., using waiting time metrics and utilization heatmaps) would identify resources with utilization >80% and high queue lengths. For example, if MILL-03 shows average queue times >2 hours and utilization near 90%, it indicates a bottleneck. By correlating this with overall makespan, we can quantify impact—e.g., a bottleneck might increase average flow time by 20-30%. Variant analysis could show that jobs routed through bottlenecks have longer lead times, contributing to tardiness.

- **Poor Task Prioritization Leading to Delays:**
  - **Pathology:** The mix of FCFS and EDD rules fails to prioritize high-priority or near-due-date jobs, allowing low-priority jobs to block critical paths.
  - **Evidence:** Analyze job variants by priority and due date adherence. For instance, compare traces of "High" priority jobs (e.g., JOB-7005) vs. "Medium" ones. If high-priority jobs experience long waits (e.g., due to FCFS), this indicates poor prioritization. Metrics like tardiness frequency could show that 60% of urgent jobs are late, with process mining revealing that priority changes often lead to rescheduling conflicts, increasing average lateness by 15-20%.

- **Suboptimal Sequencing Increasing Setup Times:**
  - **Pathology:** Random or FCFS sequencing ignores sequence-dependent setups, leading to excessive setup times and reduced machine efficiency.
  - **Evidence:** From setup time analysis, cluster job sequences and calculate total setup time per machine. If the log shows frequent long setups (e.g., JOB-7001's 23.5 min setup after JOB-6998), sequence mining could identify inefficient patterns, such as high setup times when jobs with dissimilar attributes are sequenced consecutively. This might increase total setup time by 10-15% compared to optimal sequencing, as quantified by comparing actual vs. theoretical minimum setups.

- **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
  - **Pathology:** Upstream bottlenecks or poor coordination cause downstream machines to starve, leading to underutilization and high WIP.
  - **Evidence:** Use social network analysis to map resource interactions, identifying idle times on downstream machines (e.g., Grinding idle while Cutting queues build). Metrics like idle time percentage and WIP levels (calculated from queue events) could show starvation events, e.g., Milling idle for 30% of time due to upstream delays. Process mining could detect this through flow analysis, showing that WIP bulges upstream and starves downstream resources.

- **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
  - **Pathology:** Scheduling variability amplifies WIP fluctuations, causing inventory buildup and unpredictable lead times.
  - **Evidence:** Plot WIP over time using aggregated queue data, revealing oscillations (e.g., WIP spikes during disruptions). Variance analysis could compare WIP in stable vs. disrupted periods, showing that breakdowns increase WIP standard deviation by 25-50%. This "bullwhip" effect is evidenced by high WIP correlating with longer lead times in process mining traces.

#### How Process Mining Provides Evidence
- **Bottleneck and Variant Analysis:** Tools like Celonis can highlight bottlenecks and compare variants (e.g., on-time vs. late jobs) to pinpoint causes. For example, late jobs might show longer queue times at specific machines, indicating scheduling issues.
- **Resource Contention Periods:** Analyze overlapping task assignments to find contention, e.g., multiple jobs queuing for the same machine during peak hours.
- **Overall Approach:** By integrating metrics (e.g., waiting times, utilization), process mining quantifies the impact of current rules, providing objective evidence for pathologies and guiding targeted improvements.

---

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The diagnosed pathologies stem from root causes related to the limitations of the current static dispatching rules in a highly dynamic environment. Process mining helps differentiate between scheduling logic flaws and external factors (e.g., resource constraints) by analyzing historical data patterns and correlations.

#### Potential Root Causes
- **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:** Rules like FCFS and EDD are reactive and local, ignoring global shop status, sequence dependencies, and real-time changes. This leads to poor prioritization and sequencing in a high-variability setting.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Without a holistic view, schedulers cannot anticipate queue buildups or machine availability, causing delays.
- **Inaccurate Estimations:** If planned durations (e.g., 20 min setup, 60 min task) are not updated based on actual data, scheduling becomes unreliable. The log shows deviations (e.g., actual setup 23.5 min vs. planned 20 min), indicating estimation errors.
- **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** Current rules don't optimize job sequences, leading to high setup times.
- **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:** Local rules cause siloed decision-making, amplifying WIP and starvation.
- **Inadequate Disruption Response:** Breakdowns and priority changes are not proactively managed, disrupting schedules.

#### How Process Mining Differentiates Causes
- **Scheduling Logic vs. Resource Capacity:** Process mining can isolate scheduling issues by comparing performance under similar conditions. For example, if tardiness correlates with specific dispatching decisions (e.g., FCFS causing long waits for high-priority jobs), it's a logic flaw. Conversely, if delays persist even with low load (e.g., due to frequent breakdowns), it points to capacity limitations. Use correlation analysis (e.g., Pearson correlation between rule usage and KPIs) and root cause mining to trace delays back to events.
- **Inherent Variability vs. Scheduling Errors:** Analyze variance in task durations (e.g., actual vs. planned) to separate natural variability (e.g., operator skill) from scheduling-induced issues (e.g., poor sequencing). For instance, if setup times vary more due to job sequences than machine failures, it highlights a scheduling root cause.
- **Evidence from Data:** By mining the log, we can quantify how often static rules lead to suboptimal outcomes (e.g., 70% of late jobs had FCFS sequencing), versus external factors (e.g., breakdowns accounting for 20% of delays). This data-driven differentiation informs targeted strategies.

### 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

Based on process mining insights, I propose three sophisticated, data-driven scheduling strategies that are dynamic, adaptive, and predictive. These leverage historical data to address identified pathologies, moving beyond static rules. Each strategy uses process mining to inform its design, focusing on KPIs like tardiness, WIP, lead time, and utilization.

#### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules
- **Core Logic:** Develop dynamic dispatching rules that prioritize jobs at each work center based on multiple factors, weighted by historical data. For example, a multi-criteria rule could score jobs using: (a) Earliest Due Date, (b) Job Priority, (c) Remaining Processing Time, (d) Estimated Sequence-Dependent Setup Time, and (e) Downstream Machine Load. Use a weighted sum or machine learning-based scoring (e.g., regression from process mining data) to select the next job. This is applied in real-time at each machine, with weights adjusted based on shop conditions.
- **Use of Process Mining Insights:** Analyze historical logs to derive factor weights. For instance, correlation analysis might show that downstream load has a high impact on tardiness, so it gets a higher weight. Setup time models (from sequence mining) estimate setup durations for job pairs, reducing setup-related delays.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** Targets poor prioritization and suboptimal sequencing by considering global factors, reducing tardiness and setup times. For example, it prevents starvation by factoring in downstream loads.
- **Expected Impact on KPIs:** 
  - Tardiness: Reduced by 20-30% through better prioritization.
  - WIP: Lower by 15-25% as balanced loading reduces queue buildups.
  - Lead Time: Improved predictability, with reduced variance.
  - Utilization: Increased by 5-10% by minimizing idle and setup times.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling
- **Core Logic:** Use predictive analytics to generate proactive schedules, forecasting task durations, bottlenecks, and disruptions. Incorporate machine learning models (e.g., random forests) trained on historical data to predict durations based on job attributes, operator, and machine state. Integrate predictive maintenance by analyzing breakdown patterns (e.g., from "Breakdown Start" events) to anticipate failures. Schedules are updated in real-time using current shop floor data from the MES.
- **Use of Process Mining Insights:** Mine duration distributions (e.g., fitting Weibull distributions to task times) and disruption frequencies. For example, variant analysis of past breakdowns informs failure predictions, while flow time data helps forecast bottlenecks.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** Counters inaccurate estimations and poor disruption handling by providing realistic forecasts, reducing lead time unpredictability and tardiness. It also minimizes WIP by smoothing workloads.
- **Expected Impact on KPIs:** 
  - Tardiness: Decreased by 25-40% with accurate delay predictions.
  - WIP: Reduced by 20-30% through proactive load balancing.
  - Lead Time: Variance cut by 30-50%, improving customer estimates.
  - Utilization: Enhanced by 10-15% by predicting and avoiding starvations.

#### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization
- **Core Logic:** Focus on minimizing sequence-dependent setups through intelligent job batching and sequencing at bottleneck machines. Use clustering algorithms to group similar jobs (e.g., by material or size) and optimize sequences (e.g., using traveling salesman heuristics). This is applied dynamically, with batches formed based on real-time queue data and historical setup patterns.
- **Use of Process Mining Insights:** Sequence mining identifies job attribute clusters with low setup times (e.g., jobs with similar "Notes" or resource usage). Metrics like setup time distributions inform the optimization model, ensuring sequences minimize total setup overhead.
- **Addressing Pathologies:** Directly tackles suboptimal sequencing and high setup times, reducing bottleneck impacts and WIP. It also improves coordination by considering global sequences.
- **Expected Impact on KPIs:** 
  - Tardiness: Improved by 15-25% as shorter setups speed up processing.
  - WIP: Reduced by 10-20% with efficient batching.
  - Lead Time: Shortened by 10-15% due to faster machine cycles.
  - Utilization: Increased by 15-20% by cutting setup waste.

### 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

To ensure the proposed strategies are effective before deployment, I recommend using discrete-event simulation (DES) parameterized with process mining-derived data. DES models the shop floor as a network of entities (jobs, machines, operators) with stochastic behaviors, allowing testing under various scenarios.

#### Simulation for Testing and Comparison
- **DES Setup:** Use tools like Arena, Simul8, or AnyLogic, parameterized with data from process mining (e.g., task duration distributions, routing probabilities, breakdown frequencies, setup time models). For instance, fit probability distributions (e.g., exponential for inter-arrival times, normal for task durations) based on log analysis. Incorporate disruptions (e.g., breakdown rates from historical data) and current dispatching rules as the baseline.
- **Testing Scenarios:** 
  - High Load: Simulate peak demand periods (e.g., 80-100% capacity) to test tardiness and WIP under stress.
  - Frequent Disruptions: Model scenarios with increased breakdowns or priority changes (e.g., 20% higher frequency) to evaluate adaptive strategies.
  - Mixed Job Mix: Vary job routings and priorities to assess robustness.
  - Strategy Comparison: Run simulations for each proposed strategy, comparing KPIs (e.g., average tardiness, WIP levels) against the baseline. Use statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) to determine significance.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Simulations could show, for example, that Predictive Scheduling reduces tardiness by 35% in disruption scenarios, validating its effectiveness.

#### Framework for Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation
- **Monitoring:** Implement a real-time dashboard using process mining tools to track KPIs (e.g., live utilization, queue times). Set thresholds for anomalies (e.g., queue time >60 min triggers alert).
- **Adaptation:** Use ongoing process mining on new event logs to detect drifts (e.g., concept drift in duration distributions). Apply machine learning to retrain models (e.g., updating setup time predictions) and adjust strategy parameters (e.g., reweighting dispatching rules based on recent data).
- **Continuous Improvement Cycle:** 
  - **Detect:** Monitor KPIs and use conformance checking to identify deviations.
  - **Analyze:** Run root cause analysis on new data to pinpoint issues.
  - **Adapt:** Update strategies (e.g., recalibrate predictive models) and test via simulation before implementation.
  - **Iterate:** Review performance quarterly, ensuring sustained improvements in tardiness, WIP, and utilization.

This framework ensures the scheduling system evolves with the shop floor, maintaining efficiency in a dynamic environment.
