Sure! Here is an example implementation of a partially ordered workflow language (POWL) model for a hypothetical purchase-to-pay process:
```python
import random

# Define the decision-making operators and their properties
def XOR(o):
    return o.label + " AND " + o.operator

class ProductToPurchase:
    def __init__(self, label, producer, product):
        self.label = label
        self.producer = producer
        self.product = product

    def order(self):
        # Create a POWL model with a partial order over the nodes that define purchase-to-purchase decisions
        powl = StrictPartialOrder()
        
        # Define the decision-making operators for each node in the process
        powl.add_node(ProductToPurchase(label="Product", producer=self.producer, product="apple"))
        powl.add_node(ProductToPurchase(label="Product", producer=self.producer, product="banana"))  
        powl.add_node(ProductToPurchase(label="Product", producer=self.producer, product="orange"))
        
        # Define the operator XOR for a decision-making operation (purchase-to-purchase)
        xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[ProductToPurchase("Product", self.producer, "banana"), ProductToPurchase("Product", self.producer, "mango")])
        powl.add_node(xor)
        
        # Define the operator LOP for a loop that completes one purchase
        loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=operator.LOOP, children=[xor, random.choice([ProductToPurchase("Product", self.producer, "banana"), ProductToPurchase("Product", self.producer, "mango")])])
        
        # Create the partial order over the POWL model defined above
        root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor, product_to_purchase_order])
    
        # Define the decision-making operators and their properties for each node in the POWL model
        powl.add_node(ProductToPurchase(label="Product", producer=self.producer))
        powl.add_property("purchase-to-purchase decisions", OperatorPOWL(), children=[root]) 
        powl.order.add_edge(product_to_purchase_order, root)
```

In this implementation, we have defined an instance of the `ProductToPurchase` class for each product and the nodes that define purchase-to-purchase decisions. The decision-making operators for each node in the process are specified using the `OperatorPOWL` and `XOR` classes from pm4py. We also created a `loop` node that completes one purchase, and we use the random.choice method to simulate a possible purchase order.
Finally, we create a partial order over the POWL model defined above and add the nodes for the purchase-to-purchase decisions, loop, and product_to_purchase_order. This will give us a partially ordered workflow language (POWL) model that can represent the hypothetical process of purchasing a product.
Note that this is just an example implementation and you may need to adapt it to your specific use case or use case environment.
