### **Analysis of the Event Log for Manufacturing Process Mining**

The event log contains 15 snapshots of machine operations over a short time period (from 8:00:00 to 8:01:10). Each event includes the following attributes:

- **Timestamp**
- **Machine ID (M1)**
- **Temperature (°C)**
- **Pressure (bar)**
- **Vibration Level (Hz)**
- **Material Flow (units/s)**
- **Tool Position (mm)**
- **Energy (kWh)**

The goal is to identify **distinct phases** in the data and **assign meaningful activity labels** based on the patterns observed in the sensor readings.

## **Step 1: Observing Patterns in the Data**

Let’s examine the data for changes in sensor readings and group events that show similar behavior.

### **Event Group 1: Initial Setup / Idle (Events 1–3)**
- **Temperature:** 20–21°C (low, stable)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (low, stable)
- **Vibration:** 0 Hz (no vibration)
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s (no material movement)
- **Tool Position:** 0 mm (tool not in use)
- **Energy:** 0.40–0.50 kWh (low)

**Observation:** All values are low and stable. This likely represents a **setup or idle** state, where the machine is not actively running.

---

### **Event Group 2: Cutting Operation (Events 4–6)**
- **Temperature:** 50–58°C (moderate to high)
- **Pressure:** 1–1.5 bar (moderate)
- **Vibration:** 30–38 Hz (moderate)
- **Material Flow:** 5 units/s (constant)
- **Tool Position:** 5–10 mm (increasing, indicating tool movement)
- **Energy:** 2.00–3.00 kWh (rising)

**Observation:** Rising temperature, pressure, and vibration, along with steady material flow and increasing tool position, suggest a **cutting operation**. The energy consumption is also increasing, consistent with active machining.

---

### **Event Group 3: High Energy / High Vibration (Event 9)**
- **Temperature:** 80°C (very high)
- **Pressure:** 2 bar (high)
- **Vibration:** 50 Hz (very high)
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s (stopped)
- **Tool Position:** 15 mm (fixed)
- **Energy:** 5.00 kWh (very high)

**Observation:** This event stands out with a **sudden spike in temperature and vibration**, but material flow is zero. This could indicate a **high-energy phase**, possibly a **welding or high-speed cutting**, or a **fault condition**. However, since no material is moving and the tool position is fixed, it may represent a **tool engagement or high-load phase**.

---

### **Event Group 4: Transition / Cooling (Events 10–12)**
- **Temperature:** 30–25°C (decreasing)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (low)
- **Vibration:** 1–5 Hz (low)
- **Material Flow:** 0–1 units/s (very low)
- **Tool Position:** 15–20 mm (increasing)
- **Energy:** 1.00–1.60 kWh (low)

**Observation:** Temperature and energy are decreasing, and material flow is low. The tool position increases slightly, suggesting a **transition phase** or **cooling down** after a high-load operation. This could be **preparing for the next step** or **post-cutting inspection**.

---

### **Event Group 5: Final Setup / Idle (Events 13–15)**
- **Temperature:** 20–21°C (low, stable)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (low, stable)
- **Vibration:** 0 Hz (no vibration)
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s (no material movement)
- **Tool Position:** 0 mm (tool not in use)
- **Energy:** 0.40–0.50 kWh (low)

**Observation:** Similar to the initial setup. This likely represents a **final idle or shutdown** state.

---

## **Step 2: Assigning Activity Labels**

Based on the above observations, here is the labeled activity grouping:

| Group | Events | Activity Label        | Rationale |
|-------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| 1     | 1–3    | **Machine Setup / Idle** | All sensors are low and stable, indicating the machine is not in operation. |
| 2     | 4–6    | **Cutting Operation**    | Rising temperature, pressure, vibration, and steady material flow with tool movement. |
| 3     | 9      | **High-Load / Tool Engagement** | Sudden spike in temperature, vibration, and energy, with no material flow and fixed tool position. |
| 4     | 10–12  | **Transition / Cooling** | Temperature and energy are decreasing, with low material flow and slight tool movement. |
| 5     | 13–15  | **Machine Setup / Idle** | Same as Group 1, likely a shutdown or preparation phase. |

---

## **Step 3: Summary of Labeled Activities**

### 1. **Machine Setup / Idle (Events 1–3, 13–15)**
- **Rationale:** All sensor readings are low and stable. No material is moving, and the tool is inactive. This is the **initial or final idle state** of the machine.

### 2. **Cutting Operation (Events 4–6)**
- **Rationale:** Rising temperature, pressure, and vibration, along with steady material flow and increasing tool position. These are consistent with a **cutting operation**.

### 3. **High-Load / Tool Engagement (Event 9)**
- **Rationale:** Sudden spike in temperature and vibration, high energy consumption, and fixed tool position. This likely represents a **high-load or tool engagement phase**, possibly a **welding or heavy cutting** operation.

### 4. **Transition / Cooling (Events 10–12)**
- **Rationale:** Temperature and energy are decreasing, and material flow is low. This appears to be a **transition phase**, possibly **cooling down** or **preparing for the next activity**.

## **Conclusion**

By analyzing the sensor data for changes in temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption, we were able to identify **five distinct phases** in the manufacturing process:

1. **Machine Setup / Idle**
2. **Cutting Operation**
3. **High-Load / Tool Engagement**
4. **Transition / Cooling**
5. **Machine Setup / Idle**

These labeled activities provide a high-level view of the process, enabling further process mining, optimization, or anomaly detection.
