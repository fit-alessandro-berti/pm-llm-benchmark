 Sure, here is an example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```
{
  "equivalence": {"A": {"B", "C"}, "D": {"E", "F"}},
  "always_before": {"A": {"B", "C", "D"}, "E": {"G", "H"}},
  "always_after": {"B": {"I", "J"}, "C": {"K", "L"}, "D": {"M", "N"}},
  "never_together": {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N"},
  "activ_freq": {"A": {0, 1}, "B": {1, 2}, "C": {0, 1}, "D": {0, 1}, "E": {1, 2}, "F": {0, 1}, "G": {0, 1}, "H": {0, 1}, "I": {0, 1}, "J": {0, 1}, "K": {0, 1}, "L": {0, 1}, "M": {0, 1}, "N": {0, 1}},
  "directly_follows": {"A": {"B", "C"}, "E": {"G", "H"}}
}
```
In this example, the 'activ_freq' constraint specifies that activities A and D can occur at most once each, while B, C, and E can occur two times. Activities G and H can occur at most one time each. The 'directly_follows' constraint specifies that activity A must be followed immediately by B or C. Similarly, activity E must be followed immediately by G or H.

This Log Skeleton model represents the basic structure of a Purchase-to-Pay process, with the constraints on when activities can occur in relation to each other.
