Looking closely at the sequence of events, the first case follows a logical flow: the requisition is created and approved, then the purchase order is issued, goods are received, the invoice arrives, and matching and payment follow. This aligns with expected P2P order.

In the second case, there's a more significant deviation: the purchase order is issued before the requisition is approved. This breaks the standard control flow, as the approval step is meant to authorize spending before any order is sent to the vendor. Even though the requisition is approved later, doing so after the order has already been issued suggests either a bypass of controls or a manual override, which could indicate a policy violation or process inefficiency.

The third case shows the payment being released before the goods are received. In a typical P2P process, payment is made only after verification that the goods have arrived and match the order, ensuring the company doesn't pay for undelivered or incorrect items. Releasing payment early could expose the organization to financial risk or fraud.

The fourth case is perhaps the most concerning: goods are received before the purchase order is even issued. This sequence can happen in rare situations, like emergency purchases, but generally it's a red flag. Without a formal purchase order, there's no documented agreement with the vendor, no price verification, and no internal authorization—leaving the company vulnerable to overpayment, unauthorized purchases, or disputes with vendors.

Each of these deviations from the expected process sequence could indicate either procedural lapses, system errors, or even attempts to circumvent internal controls. In a well-managed P2P process, these anomalies should prompt further investigation to ensure compliance and financial integrity.
