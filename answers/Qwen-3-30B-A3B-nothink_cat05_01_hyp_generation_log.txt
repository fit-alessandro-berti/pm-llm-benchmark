Here's a prompt you can use to guide the target LLM to identify anomalies, hypothesize their causes, and suggest SQL queries to investigate further:

---

**Prompt:**

You are given a database schema and event logs for an order processing system. Your task is to:

1. **Identify anomalies or undesirable behaviors** in the `order_event_log` data.
2. **Hypothesize why these anomalies might occur** (e.g., system errors, policy violations, training issues, etc.).
3. **Propose relevant SQL queries** on the `order_event_log` table (and possibly `orders` and `resources` tables) to investigate these anomalies further.

**Instructions:**

- Analyze the sequence of events for each `case_id`.
- Look for deviations from the assumed normal process flow.
- Consider the order of activities, timestamps, and resource roles.
- Look for missing steps, out-of-order activities, or unusual resource usage.
- Pay attention to `additional_info` fields for clues.
- Provide a clear explanation of each anomaly, its potential cause, and the SQL query that would help investigate it.

**Assumed Normal Process Flow (for reference):**
1. Register Order (Sales)
2. Perform Credit Check (Finance)
3. Validate Stock (Warehouse)
4. Confirm Shipment (Logistics)
5. Ship Goods (Warehouse)
6. Issue Invoice (Finance)
7. Receive Payment (Finance)

---

**Example of what to look for:**

- A case where `Receive Payment` occurs before `Issue Invoice`.
- A case where a `Credit Check` is performed after `Ship Goods`.
- A case where an activity is skipped or repeated.
- A case where a resource from a different department performs an activity not in their role.
- A case where the time between events is unusually short or long.

---

**Deliverable:**

For each anomaly you identify, provide:

- **Anomaly Description**
- **Hypothesized Cause**
- **SQL Query** (with explanation) to investigate the anomaly

This prompt encourages the LLM to think critically, recognize patterns, and generate useful SQL queries for further analysis, all without direct guidance.
