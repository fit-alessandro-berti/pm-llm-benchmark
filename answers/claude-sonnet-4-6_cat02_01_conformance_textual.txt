# Analysis of Event Log Cases Against Normative Process

## Summary of Normative Rules

Before analyzing each case, let me extract the key constraints from the description:

1. **Receive order** must always be first.
2. **Check inventory** must occur before any payment authorization or fulfillment decisions.
3. **Authorize payment** must occur after Check inventory and before Package items.
4. **Package items** must occur after Authorize payment and before Ship order.
5. **Ship order** must occur after Package items and **never** after a cancellation.
6. **Cancel order** follows Check inventory when stock is insufficient; no fulfillment activities should follow.
7. **Close order** must always be the final activity.

## Case-by-Case Analysis

###  Case 1 — **No Violation**
| Activity | Order |
|---|---|
| Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order |

This perfectly matches the normative "sufficient inventory" path. All sequencing rules are satisfied.

###  Case 2 — **Violation Identified**

**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items  Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:**
- **Package items occurs before Authorize payment.** The normative description explicitly states that payment must be authorized *before* items are packaged, because items should only be prepared for shipment once payment validity is confirmed. Here, the order of these two activities is swapped, which violates the rule: *"Package items should only occur after authorization."*

###  Case 3 — **Multiple Violations Identified**

**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violations:**

1. **Ship order occurs after Cancel order.** The normative description is explicit: *"Ship order should never occur after a cancellation."* Shipping a canceled order is a direct and unambiguous violation.

2. **Authorize payment followed by Cancel order (contextual violation).** Once inventory is found insufficient, the process should go directly from Check inventory to Cancel order. The presence of Authorize payment before Cancel order suggests either that payment was authorized unnecessarily (i.e., before knowing inventory was insufficient) or that the cancellation path was entered after payment authorization — neither of which aligns with the normative flow. Authorizing payment in a cancellation scenario is illogical and represents a deviation from the intended branching logic.

###  Case 4 — **No Violation**

**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This perfectly matches the normative "insufficient inventory" cancellation path. All constraints are satisfied.

---

###  Case 5 — **Violation Identified**

**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violation:**
- **Package items is missing; Ship order occurs without prior packaging.** The normative description states that *"Package items should only occur before shipping"* and that *"Ship order should only occur after packaging."* Skipping the packaging step and proceeding directly from Authorize payment to Ship order violates the required sequence. Items cannot be shipped without first being properly packaged.

## Summary Table

| Case | Verdict | Violation(s) |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 |  Compliant | None |
| 2 |  Violation | Package items occurs before Authorize payment |
| 3 |  Violation | (1) Ship order occurs after Cancel order; (2) Authorize payment inappropriately precedes cancellation |
| 4 |  Compliant | None |
| 5 |  Violation | Ship order occurs without Package items (packaging step skipped entirely) |
