Below is a structured, end-to-end approach for Precision Parts Inc., showing how to leverage process mining to both understand past performance in depth and to develop, test and continuously refine advanced, data-driven scheduling strategies.

================================================================================
1. ANALYZING HISTORICAL SCHEDULING PERFORMANCE AND DYNAMICS
================================================================================

1.1 Reconstructing the “As-Is” Shop-Floor Flow  
•  Import the MES event log into a process-mining tool (e.g. ProM, Disco, Celonis).  
•  Define each job (“case”) by its unique Case ID; define activities by Task Start/End, Setup Start/End, Queue Entry/Exit, Breakdown, Priority Change.  
•  Build a process model (DAG or Petri net) showing the possible routings (Cut  Mill  Lathe  …  Inspection).  
•  Overlay timestamps to obtain the actual sequence and concurrency of tasks across machines.  

1.2 Key Process Mining Metrics & Techniques  
a) Job Flow Times, Lead Times, Makespan  
  – Compute case-level cycle time: from “Job Released” to “Final Task End.”  
  – Derive distribution (min, mean, p50, p90, max) and identify heavy-tail cases.  

b) Task Waiting (Queue) Times  
  – For each Queue Entry  Task Start interval at each machine.  
  – Aggregate by machine to get average and percentile wait times.  
  – Time-series view to spot peak congestion periods.  

c) Resource Utilization  
  – For each machine/operator, classify each timestamp as “productive” (Task Start  Task End), “setup” (Setup Start  Setup End), “idle” (gaps when up but no queued jobs), or “down” (Breakdown Start  Breakdown End).  
  – Compute % time in each state over shifts/days/weeks.  

d) Sequence-Dependent Setup Times  
  – Extract all Setup events, capturing (Machine, Prev Job ID  Curr Job ID, Actual Duration).  
  – Construct a setup-time matrix S[i,j] = avg setup when job of type i is followed by j.  
  – Visualize high-cost transitions; compute overall share of setup time attributable to “bad” sequences.  

e) Schedule Adherence & Tardiness  
  – For each job: Tardiness = max(0, Actual Completion Date – Due Date).  
  – Compute on-time delivery rate, average tardiness, # jobs per lateness band.  
  – Plot tardiness vs. priority, vs. routing length, vs. arrival date.  

f) Disruption Impact  
  – Correlate downtime events (breakdowns, hot-job injections) with spikes in queue times and tardiness.  
  – Use “before/after” conformance checking: compare cases that traverse a bottleneck immediately before vs. after a breakdown.  

================================================================================
2. DIAGNOSING SCHEDULING PATHOLOGIES
================================================================================

2.1 Identifying Bottlenecks  
•  Use throughput and sojourn-time heatmaps: highlight machines with highest avg queue + processing backlog.  
•  Compute Little’s Law metrics per workstation: WIP, throughput, cycle time  confirm bottleneck per utilization 100%.  

2.2 Priority Inversions & Delays  
•  Variant Analysis: split traces into “High-priority early,” “High-priority late,” “Low-priority early,” etc.  
•  Compare average waiting times—if high-priority jobs wait longer than low, dispatch rule failure is evident.  

2.3 Suboptimal Sequencing  
•  Sum total setup time per shift on each machine, then compare against “ideal” minimal sequence (solve TSP on S-matrix for that set of jobs).  
•  Compute extra setup % = (actual total – minimal total)/minimal total.  

2.4 Downstream Starvation  
•  Chart time series of WIP arrival rates into each work center.  
•  Identify intervals when a downstream machine idles despite upstream backlog (due to blocking at intermediate buffers).  

2.5 Bullwhip in WIP  
•  Plot WIP levels at key buffers over time; compute standard deviation vs mean.  
•  Correlate WIP volatility with schedule changes (priority shifts, breakdowns).  

================================================================================
3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF SCHEDULING INEFFECTIVENESS
================================================================================

3.1 Static Dispatching Limitations  
•  Existing FCFS/EDD rules ignore sequence-dependent setups, downstream congestion, and stochastic breakdown risk.  
•  Process mining: reveal large variances between planned vs actual wait/processing times.  

3.2 Lack of Real-Time Visibility  
•  No closed-loop: scheduling decisions made on stale WIP snapshots.  
•  Mining “decision latency”: time between event (job completion upstream) and rescheduling at downstream.  

3.3 Inaccurate Time Estimates  
•  Compare “planned” vs “actual” durations per task type, per operator, per material.  
•  Identify systematic biases (e.g. under-estimation on Grinding).  

3.4 Poor Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups  
•  No explicit model of S-matrix in dispatching: random job order, leading to inflated setup overhead.  

3.5 Bottleneck Overloading & Starvation  
•  Evidence: critical machines run at >98% utilization with queues growing, while non-bottlenecks are under 60%.  

3.6 Distinguishing Scheduling Logic vs Capacity Limits  
•  Use “what-if” conformance: simulate current schedule on a reduced-variability log (e.g. remove breakdown cases) – if tardiness remains, logic is at fault; if tardiness drops, capacity/variability drives delays.  

================================================================================
4. DEVELOPING ADVANCED DATA-DRIVEN SCHEDULING STRATEGIES
================================================================================

4.1 Strategy 1 – Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules  
Core Logic  
  •  At each machine, compute a composite priority index for each queued job j:  
     PI(j) = w1·Slack(j)¹ + w2·RemainingProcTime(j)¹ + w3·PriorityScore(j) + w4·DownstreamLoad(j)¹ – w5·EstSetupTime(j|prev).  
  •  Slack(j) = DueDate – (Now + sum remaining avg processing & wait times).  
  •  DownstreamLoad = sum of queue lengths on next machines in routing.  
Calibration via Process Mining  
  •  Use historical data to regress each factor’s coefficient (w1…w5) against minimizing actual tardiness.  
Expected Impact  
  •  Reduces priority inversions, balances utilization, explicitly trades off setup minimization vs due-date adherence.  
  •  KPIs:  average tardiness,  WIP,  critical-machine throughput.  

4.2 Strategy 2 – Predictive, Rolling-Horizon Scheduling  
Core Logic  
  •  Build predictive models for each task’s actual duration (e.g. XGBoost using features: job type, operator, material, machine, prior setup).  
  •  Train a predictive breakdown model (e.g. Weibull on time-between-failures plus sensor cues if available).  
  •  Every T minutes (rolling horizon), solve a robust, stochastic scheduling MILP for the next H hours, embedding uncertainty buffers on high-variance tasks and probabilistic downtime.  
  •  Produce a tentative Gantt, release only the next few dispatch decisions to the shop floor, then re-optimize.  
How Mining Informs It  
  •  Extract empirical distributions for processing, setup, downtime; learn correlations (e.g. certain job types stress specific machines).  
Expected Impact  
  •  Proactively avoids congestion by anticipating queues, dynamically reroutes work when a breakdown is forecast.  
  •  KPIs:  lead-time variability,  on-time rate, improved slack utilization.  

4.3 Strategy 3 – Sequence-Dependent Setup Optimization via Batching  
Core Logic  
  •  For each bottleneck machine, define decision epochs (e.g. every n queued jobs or T minutes).  
  •  Solve a traveling-salesman-like heuristic on the subset of waiting jobs, using the S-matrix and processing times to minimize (Setup + Processing) subject to due-date penalties.  
  •  Enforce “micro-batches” of similar jobs (same material/tooling) to reduce high-cost transitions.  
Mining-Driven Inputs  
  •  S-matrix, job similarity clusters (material, tooling), due-date urgency.  
Expected Impact  
  •   total setup time by X–Y% (historical savings bound),  throughput on bottlenecks,  overall WIP growth.  

================================================================================
5. SIMULATION, EVALUATION AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

5.1 Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Testing  
•  Build a DES model (e.g. in AnyLogic, Simio, SimPy) parameterized with:  
   – Routing probabilities, task and setup time distributions, breakdown rates, repair times, arrival patterns, priority mix (mined from logs).  
•  Scenarios to test:  
   a) High utilization (90%)  
   b) Surge of urgent “hot” jobs  
   c) Increased breakdown frequency (+50%)  
   d) Low variability (baseline)  
•  Experiment: run baseline rule set vs each of the three strategies, collecting: avg tardiness, % on-time, avg WIP, machine utilizations, avg lead times.  
•  Statistical analysis (paired t-tests or nonparametric) to confirm significance of KPI improvements.

5.2 Continuous Monitoring & Closed-Loop Adaptation  
•  Establish a live process-mining pipeline: ingest daily event-log snapshots into a dashboard (Celonis/Camunda etc.).  
•  Monitor key KPI trends and alerts for: rising tardiness, queue spikes, deviation of actual vs predicted tasks times.  
•  Automated root-cause mining: when KPI drift detected, trigger variant comparison (e.g. last week vs prior week) to isolate emergent bottlenecks or rule misfires.  
•  Periodically (e.g. monthly) retrain predictive models and recalibrate dispatching weights (w1…w5) using the newest 6–12 months of data.  
•  Governance: a review board of operations, maintenance, and IT to validate model updates and approve strategy refinements.
