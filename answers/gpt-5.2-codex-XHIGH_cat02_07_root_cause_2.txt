Below is a concise performance analysis of the event log and a rootcause assessment based on the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity).

##  1) Which cases take significantly longer?

**Case durations (start  close):**

| Case | Start  End | Duration | Notes |
|------|------------|----------|------|
| **2001** | 20240401 09:00  10:30 | **1h 30m** | Low complexity |
| **2004** | 20240401 09:20  10:45 | **1h 25m** | Low complexity |
| **2002** | 20240401 09:05  20240402 11:00 | **~26h** | Medium complexity + 1 doc request |
| **2003** | 20240401 09:10  20240403 09:30 | **~48h** | High complexity + 2 doc requests |
| **2005** | 20240401 09:25  20240404 14:30 | **~77h** | High complexity + 3 doc requests |

**Cases 2003 and 2005 are clearly the worst performers.**  
Case 2002 is moderately delayed compared to lowcomplexity cases.

##  2) Rootcause analysis by attributes

### **A. Complexity is the strongest driver**
- **Low complexity  no document requests  fast**
- **Medium/High complexity  document loops  slow**

| Complexity | Avg Duration | Pattern |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Low | ~1.5 hours | Straightthrough |
| Medium | ~26 hours | 1 request |
| High | 48–77 hours | multiple requests |

**Root cause:** High complexity claims trigger **rework loops**, which create long idle waiting times between requests and approvals.

---

### **B. Activity delays are clustered around “Request Additional Documents”**
- Case 2003: two requests on Apr1, approval only on Apr2 16:00  
- Case 2005: three requests over **3 days**, approval on Apr4

**Root cause:** Customers or internal staff likely take time to provide/validate missing info, causing long gaps.

---

### **C. Resource influence (possible bottlenecks)**
- **Manager_Bill** appears only in highcomplexity cases  approvals slower  
- **Adjuster_Lisa** handles 2002 + 2005 (both have multiple document requests)

This suggests **resource workload or capability** may be contributing, but is secondary to complexity.

---

### **D. Region is not a primary cause**
- Region A has both fast (2001) and slow (2003) cases  
- Region B has fast (2004) and slow (2005) cases  

So **region alone is not causal**—delays map more strongly to complexity and document requests.

---

##  3) Why these attributes cause delays & how to fix them

### **Likely explanations**
1. **Highcomplexity claims need more info**  repeated document requests  
2. **Incomplete initial submissions** create rework loops  
3. **Specialized resources (e.g., Manager_Bill)** may be limited or overloaded  
4. **Slow document turnaround from customers** creates idle time

---

##  Recommendations to reduce delays

### **Operational fixes**
- **Improve firsttime claim completeness**
  - Mandatory checklists, digital validation, document upload portal
- **Automated reminders**
  - Reduce customer response time on document requests
- **Dedicated highcomplexity team**
  - Specialized staff + faster decision turnaround
- **Load balance approvals**
  - Offload some approvals from Manager_Bill or add backup approvers
- **Monitor documentloop frequency**
  - Flag adjusters who request repeatedly (e.g., Lisa/Mike)

---

###  Summary

 **Cases 2003 & 2005 are the worst performers**  
 **Primary root cause = high complexity + repeated document requests**  
 **Secondary causes = resource bottlenecks (Manager_Bill, Adjuster_Lisa)**  
 **Region has minor influence**

If you'd like, I can also create a visual timeline or compute bottleneck times between each activity.
