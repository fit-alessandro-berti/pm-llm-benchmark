### **Explanation of Logic**

#### **1. Case Identification**
Cases were identified based on logical groupings of user activities centered around specific documents or tasks. Each document or task (e.g., editing a Word document, reviewing a PDF, replying to an email) was treated as a distinct case. The following rules were applied:
- A new case starts when a user focuses on a new document or application.
- Related actions within the same document or task are grouped into the same case.
- For example:
  - All actions related to `Document1.docx` are grouped under the case `Document1_Case`.
  - Actions involving `Quarterly_Report.docx` form the `Quarterly_Report_Case`.

#### **2. Activity Naming**
Low-level system actions (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH") were translated into higher-level, meaningful activity names that describe the purpose of the action in the context of the task. Examples:
- `"FOCUS"` combined with `"App=Microsoft Word"` and `"Window=Document1.docx"` became `"Open Document1.docx"`.
- `"TYPING"` with keys indicating content edits became `"Edit Document1.docx"`.
- `"SAVE"` was directly mapped to `"Save Document1.docx"`.

#### **3. Event Attributes**
Each event includes:
- **Case ID**: Identifies the logical grouping of activities (e.g., `Document1_Case`, `Email_Case`).
- **Activity Name**: Describes the high-level activity performed.
- **Timestamp**: Retains the original timestamp from the system log.

#### **4. Coherent Narrative**
The final event log tells the story of the user's work session:
- The user begins by working on `Document1.docx`, editing and saving it.
- They switch to their email inbox, open and reply to an email about the annual meeting.
- Next, they review a PDF report (`Report_Draft.pdf`) and highlight key findings.
- The user then updates a budget spreadsheet (`Budget_2024.xlsx`) before returning to `Document1.docx` to make additional edits.
- Finally, they create an executive summary for the `Quarterly_Report.docx` and save it before closing the document.

This transformation ensures the event log is suitable for process mining tools, providing clear insights into the user's workflow.
