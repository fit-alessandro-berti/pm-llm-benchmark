 Based on the provided data, I can identify a few potential root causes for performance issues in the process. However, please note that these are only hypotheses and the actual root causes would need to be confirmed through further analysis.

1. High frequency of "Load Truck" followed by another "Load Truck" (Object type: Truck and Container): This pattern suggests that there might be inefficiencies or delays in the loading process, as the same event is repeated many times for the same objects. This could be due to a lack of resources, improper planning, or inefficient loading methods.
2. Long duration between "Weigh" and "Place in Stock" or "Bring to Loading Bay" (Object type: Forklift): The duration between these activities is quite long, which might indicate that there are delays in transporting or placing the weighed containers into the stock or loading bay. This could be due to a lack of resources, inefficient transportation, or issues with the storage area.
3. Long duration between "Order Empty Containers" and "Depart" (Object type: Transport Document): The time between ordering empty containers and the actual departure is very long. This could be due to delays in receiving the empty containers, issues with scheduling, or inefficiencies in the overall process.
4. High frequency of "Reschedule Container" to "Depart" or "Reschedule Container" (Object type: Transport Document): The frequent rescheduling of containers might indicate planning or scheduling issues, which could lead to delays and inefficiencies in the process.

These are the potential root causes based on the provided data. To further validate and address these issues, it would be necessary to conduct a more detailed analysis of the process, including interviews with process stakeholders, examination of resource availability, and analysis of any other relevant data points.
