The user wants me to describe a visualization. The visualization is a flowchart representing several business processes, likely related to order management and procurement. I need to identify the key elements, their relationships, and the information conveyed by the visualization.

Here's a breakdown of what I see:
- **Nodes:** Represent different stages or actions in the processes (e.g., "Create Requisition", "Approve Requisition").
- **Edges:** Represent the flow of the process between stages. They also have labels indicating the time taken for the transition (in milliseconds).
- **Start and End points:** Mark the beginning and termination of each process flow.
- **Initial entities:** At the top, there are boxes indicating initial items/requests that trigger the processes (e.g., "VendorInvoiceItem", "PurchaseRequisitionItem"). These boxes also show the "overall" count of objects.
- **Colors:** Different colors seem to be used for the nodes and edges, possibly to distinguish between different processes or categories of actions.
- **Overall time:** Each process step has an "Overall" value, likely representing the total time spent on that stage across all instances.

I need to describe the overall structure, the individual processes depicted, the information contained within each node and edge, and the potential purpose of the visualization.
