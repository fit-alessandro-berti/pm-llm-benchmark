Based on the provided data, there appear to be several possible factors that could be contributing to these differences:

1. Patient demographics: The success rates of treatment can vary based on a patient's age, medical history, and overall health. For example, older patients or those with more significant medical conditions may have lower treatment success rates.
2. Diagnosis accuracy: The accuracy of the diagnosis made during the examination process can also impact treatment success rates. If the diagnosis is incorrect, the treatment may be ineffective or even harmful to the patient.
3. Severity of symptoms: The severity of a patient's symptoms can influence their response to treatment. Patients with more severe symptoms may require more aggressive and lengthy treatments, resulting in higher success rates.
4. Type of treatment: The type of treatment prescribed for each patient can also impact the success rate. For example, some treatments may be more effective for specific medical conditions than others.
5. Hospital/clinic location: There could also be variations in treatment success rates based on the hospital or clinic where a patient receives care. Factors such as expertise of staff, resources available, and facility standards can all influence success rates.
