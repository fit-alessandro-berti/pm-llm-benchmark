Looking at the event logs for the four sample orders, I can identify several anomalies and undesirable behaviors that deviate from the assumed normal process flow:

## Identified Anomalies

### 1. **Out-of-Sequence Process Execution**
- **Order 1002**: "Confirm Shipment" (event 9) occurs BEFORE "Perform Credit Check" (event 11) and "Validate Stock" (event 12)
- **Order 1003**: "Ship Goods" (event 17) occurs BEFORE "Confirm Shipment" (event 19) - shipping without confirmation
- **Order 1004**: "Receive Payment" (event 22) occurs BEFORE "Issue Invoice" (event 23) and even before basic validation steps

### 2. **Missing Critical Steps**
- **Order 1004**: Completely missing "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock" activities
- **Order 1003**: Missing "Validate Stock" activity (goods were shipped without stock validation)

### 3. **Suspicious Timing Patterns**
- **Order 1004**: Payment received just 5 minutes after order registration, suggesting potential system manipulation or pre-payment scenario that bypasses controls
- **Order 1002**: Shipment confirmed just 5 minutes after order registration, indicating possible policy violation

## Hypothesized Causes

1. **System Integration Issues**: Different departments might be using disconnected systems allowing out-of-sequence processing
2. **Policy Violations**: Staff may be bypassing controls for "priority" customers or due to performance pressure
3. **Training Deficiencies**: Staff may not understand the required process flow
4. **Authorization Problems**: System may not enforce proper workflow sequencing
5. **Fraud or Manipulation**: Particularly in Order 1004 where payment precedes invoice and critical validations are skipped

## Investigative SQL Queries

```sql
-- 1. Find all orders with activities performed out of expected sequence
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as actual_sequence,
        CASE activity
            WHEN 'Register Order' THEN 1

    o.order_type,
    o.order_value
FROM sequence_violations sv
JOIN orders o ON sv.case_id = o.case_id
ORDER BY sv.case_id, sv.actual_sequence;

-- 2. Identify orders missing critical validation steps
WITH order_activities AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as activities_performed,
        COUNT(*) as total_activities

        ELSE 'Other Issue'
    END as missing_step

        LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp))/60 as minutes_to_next
    FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT 
    at.case_id,
    at.activity,
    at.next_activity,
    at.minutes_to_next,
    r1.role as current_role,
    r2.role as next_role,
    o.order_value,
    o.order_type
FROM activity_timestamps at
JOIN order_event_log oel1 ON at.case_id = oel1.case_id AND at.activity = oel1.activity

LEFT JOIN resources r2 ON oel2.resource = r2.resource_id
JOIN orders o ON at.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE at.minutes_to_next < 10  -- Less than 10 minutes between steps
AND (
    (at.activity = 'Register Order' AND at.next_activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Receive Payment'))
    OR (at.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND at.next_activity = 'Receive Payment' AND at.minutes_to_next < 5)
)
ORDER BY at.minutes_to_next;

-- 4. Identify resources frequently involved in anomalous processes

-- 5. Analyze patterns by order type and value
SELECT 
    o.order_type,
    CASE 
        WHEN o.order_value < 1000 THEN 'Low Value'
        WHEN o.order_value < 2500 THEN 'Medium Value'

    END) as anomalous_orders,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE 
        WHEN oel_missing.case_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1
        WHEN seq_violation.case_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1
    END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as anomaly_percentage

ORDER BY o.order_type, value_category;
```

These queries will help identify systemic issues, pinpoint problematic resources or departments, and reveal whether anomalies correlate with order types or values - which could indicate whether these are intentional policy exceptions or genuine process failures.
