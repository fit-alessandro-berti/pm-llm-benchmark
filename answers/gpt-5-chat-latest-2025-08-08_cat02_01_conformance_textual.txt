Alright — let’s step through this carefully.

## **Step 1 – Restating the Normative Rules**

From the **normative process description**, the flow should be:

### **Fulfillment scenario (sufficient inventory)**  
```
Receive order  
 Check inventory  
 Authorize payment  
 Package items  
 Ship order  
 Close order
```

### **Cancellation scenario (insufficient inventory)**  
```
Receive order  
 Check inventory  
 Cancel order  
 Close order
```

### **Core constraints:**

1. **Always start with "Receive order"** — This is the first activity in every case.
2. **Check inventory must always follow receive order** — and occur **before** payment authorization and fulfillment steps.
3. **Authorize payment only after checking inventory** — never before.
4. **Package items only after payment authorization** — never before.
5. **Ship order only after packaging** — never before — and **never after a "Cancel order"**.
6. **"Close order" must be the final activity** — no events after it.
7. In the **cancellation** branch:
   - No "Authorize payment", "Package items", or "Ship order" after "Cancel order".
8. Exactly one branch is taken (either fulfillment or cancellation). Mixed sequences (e.g., cancel then ship) are violations.

## **Step 2 – Examine the Event Log Case by Case**

---

### **Case 1**:

```
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
```

 **Matches the fulfillment branch exactly**  
No deviations.

---

### **Case 2**:

```
Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
```

**Violation(s):**
- **Rule #4 broken:** "Package items" happens **before** "Authorize payment".  
  Normative states: Payment must be authorized before packaging begins.

---

### **Case 3**:

```
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order
```

**Violation(s):**
1. **Logical violation:** If "Cancel order" occurs, the process should **not** proceed to any fulfillment activities — here, "Ship order" occurs **after** cancellation.  
2. **Branch consistency violation:** This case starts like a fulfillment branch (Authorize payment) but then takes the cancellation branch — this mixed path is not allowed.
3. **Rule #5 broken:** Shipping after a cancellation is explicitly prohibited.

---

### **Case 4**:

```
Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
```

 **Matches the cancellation branch exactly.**  
No deviations.

---

### **Case 5**:

```
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order
```

**Violation(s):**
- **Missing "Package items" step** before "Ship order".  
- This breaks **Rule #5**: Shipping must only occur **after** packaging is completed.

## **Step 3 – Summary of Deviations**

| Case | Violation(s)                                                                                   |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | None                                                                                           |
| 2    | Packaging done before payment authorization (ordering constraint broken).                      |
| 3    | Shipping after cancellation; mixing fulfillment and cancellation branches.                     |
| 4    | None                                                                                           |
| 5    | Shipping occurred without prior packaging step.                                                |

## **Step 4 – Final Answer**

**Cases violating the normative process:** **2, 3, and 5**.

### **Explanation per case:**

- **Case 2:**  
  - Violates sequencing rule: Packaging occurred **before** payment was authorized.

- **Case 3:**  
  - Violates branch logic: "Cancel order" followed by "Ship order" is illogical and prohibited.  
  - Mixed fulfillment and cancellation pathways into a single case.

- **Case 5:**  
  - Missing required "Package items" before shipping.  
  - Shipping before packaging violates fulfillment sequence.

If you want, I can **also produce a visual alignment diagram** showing correct vs. actual flows to better illustrate the violations. Would you like me to prepare that?
