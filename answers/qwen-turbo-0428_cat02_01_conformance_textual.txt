**Analysis of Event Log Cases:**

### **Cases That Violate the Normative Process:**

1. **Case 2**  
   - **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
   - **Violation:**  
     - **Incorrect Order of Activities:** "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment."  
     - **Rule Violated:** The normative process states that "Package items" should only occur **after** "Authorize payment" and **before** "Ship order." Packaging before payment authorization is invalid because payment must be confirmed before preparing items for shipment.  
     - **Impact:** This skips the critical step of verifying payment validity before packaging, increasing the risk of unapproved shipments.

2. **Case 3**  
   - **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order  
   - **Violation:**  
     - **Post-Cancellation Fulfillment:** "Ship order" occurs **after** "Cancel order."  
     - **Rule Violated:** The description explicitly prohibits fulfillment activities (e.g., shipping) after cancellation. Once an order is canceled, it should proceed directly to "Close order," not continue with shipping.  
     - **Additional Violation:** "Ship order" occurs **before** "Close order," which is required to be the final activity in all scenarios.  
     - **Impact:** This results in a shipment of a canceled order, which is illogical and violates the cancellation workflow.

3. **Case 5**  
   - **Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
   - **Violation:**  
     - **Missing Packaging Step:** "Ship order" occurs **without** "Package items" being executed.  
     - **Rule Violated:** The process mandates that "Ship order" must follow "Package items." Shipping without packaging is invalid, as items must be prepared for shipment before being dispatched.  
     - **Impact:** This skips a critical step in the fulfillment process, potentially leading to damaged or unprepared shipments.

### **Summary of Violations:**

| Case | Violation Type                     | Specific Rule Violated                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2    | Incorrect activity order           | "Package items" before "Authorize payment" (payment must precede packaging).          |
| 3    | Post-cancellation fulfillment      | "Ship order" after "Cancel order" (fulfillment activities prohibited post-cancellation). |
| 3    | Missing final activity             | "Close order" occurs after "Ship order" (must be final step).                         |
| 5    | Missing intermediate step          | "Ship order" without "Package items" (shipping requires prior packaging).              |

### **Key Interpretations of Ambiguities:**
- The normative process explicitly ties **payment authorization** to **inventory confirmation** and **packaging** to **payment approval**. Any deviation from this sequence (e.g., packaging before payment) is a clear violation.  
- **Cancellation** is a terminal event: once canceled, no further fulfillment activities (e.g., shipping) are allowed.  
- **Shipping** is contingent on **packaging**, as items must be prepared before being dispatched.  

These cases fail to adhere to the logical flow and constraints outlined in the normative process.
