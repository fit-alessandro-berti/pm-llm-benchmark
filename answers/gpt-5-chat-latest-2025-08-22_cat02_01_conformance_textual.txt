Great! Let's carefully analyze each case against the **normative process** rules.

### **Restating the Normative Rules (based on description):**

Two possible valid flows:

1. **Fulfillment Path (inventory sufficient):**
   - Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

2. **Cancellation Path (inventory insufficient):**
   - Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

**Key constraints explicitly called out:**
- **Authorize payment** must occur *after* “Check inventory,” but *before* “Package items.”
- **Package items** must occur *after* “Authorize payment,” but *before* “Ship order.”
- **Ship order** must occur only *after* packaging, and never after a cancellation.
- **Cancel order** is only valid right after inventory check, and must be followed directly by “Close order.”
- **Close order** is always *final activity* and must come last.

### **Case-by-Case Analysis**

#### **Case 1** 
- Sequence:  
  Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order  
- This exactly matches the **fulfillment path**.  
- **No violations.**

---

#### **Case 2** 
- Sequence:  
  Receive  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
- **Violation:**  
  - "Package items" occurs **before Authorize payment.**  
  - Normative rule: packaging should only occur *after payment authorization.*  
- Therefore, **case 2 is invalid.**

---

#### **Case 3** 
- Sequence:  
  Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order  
- **Violations:**  
  - If the path is cancellation (after “Cancel order”), then the process should **not proceed with fulfillment activities like Ship order.**  
  - Shipping after cancellation violates logical flow.  
  - Additionally, "Authorize payment" before cancellation is illogical—if insufficient inventory, no payment should be authorized at all.  
- Multiple violations: **case 3 is invalid.**

---

#### **Case 4** 
- Sequence:  
  Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order  
- This matches the **cancellation path.**  
- **No violations.**

---

#### **Case 5** 
- Sequence:  
  Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
- **Violation:**  
  - Missing "Package items" step between payment and shipping.  
  - Items must be physically prepared before they can be shipped.  
- Therefore, **case 5 is invalid.**

---

###  **Final Results**

- **Valid cases (follow normative flow):**
  - Case **1** (fulfillment path)  
  - Case **4** (cancellation path)

- **Invalid cases (with violations):**
  - Case **2**: "Package before payment authorization."  
  - Case **3**: "Authorized payment before cancellation" and "Shipped after cancellation."  
  - Case **5**: "Skipped packaging step before shipping."

---

 **Answer Summary:**  
Only Cases **1** and **4** comply with the normative process. Cases **2, 3, and 5** contain violations because they break the required order of steps (packaging before payment, shipping after cancellation, missing packaging).

Would you like me to **visualize each case as a flow diagram** (with correct vs incorrect paths highlighted), so it’s easier to see deviations at a glance?
