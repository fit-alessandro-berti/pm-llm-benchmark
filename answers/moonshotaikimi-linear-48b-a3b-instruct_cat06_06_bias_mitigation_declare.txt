Here is an updated DECLARE model that introduces fairness-aware constraints to the loan-application process described in the example.  
All newly added constraints appear under their usual keys; the existing entries remain unchanged.

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure ManualReview co-exists with any decision involving sensitive demographics
        "ManualReview": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Prevent an immediate response from a sensitive-attribute check to a decision
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Succession from sensitive checks is allowed only if ManualReview precedes
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "ManualReview": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Rationale for the newly added constraints**

1. **Coexistence – "ManualReview"**:  
   Any FinalDecision (Approve/Reject) is now required to be accompanied by a ManualReview in the same trace.  
   - This forces an extra human check for every automated decision, reducing the risk of unchecked bias.

2. **Response – "CheckApplicantRace/CheckApplicantGender/CheckApplicantAge"  "FinalDecision"**:  
   Direct precedence from a sensitive-attribute check to the automated decision is now forbidden.  
   - This prevents the system from rejecting or approving an application immediately after observing sensitive characteristics.

3. **Succession – "CheckApplicant…"  "ManualReview"**:  
   Sensitive checks must be followed by ManualReview; no approval/rejection may happen right after the check.  
   - Guarantees that every sensitive-attribute event is reviewed by a human before any final outcome is recorded.

4. **Succession – "ManualReview"  "FinalDecision"**:  
   A mandatory chain that every reviewed decision is followed by a decision, ensuring that the extra check is not bypassed.

These additions enforce a fairness policy:  
**Sensitive information can be gathered and reviewed, but it cannot be the sole trigger for an immediate Accept/Reject decision.**
