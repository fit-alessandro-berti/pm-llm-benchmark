## Analysis of Temporal Profile Anomalies

### 1. Identified Anomalies

**Critical Timing Irregularities:**

- **RP (Receive to Approve): ~25 hours with =1 hour** - Extremely rigid timing with minimal variation suggests automated or batch processing that bypasses normal evaluation procedures.

- **PN (Approve to Notify): 7 days with =2 days** - Excessive delay between approval and customer notification indicates severe bottleneck or system failure in communication channels.

- **AC (Assign to Close): 2 hours with =1 hour** - Suspiciously fast closure after assignment without apparent evaluation or approval steps.

- **EN (Evaluate to Notify): 5 minutes with =1 minute** - Unrealistically quick transition suggesting either automation or missing approval step.

### 2. Hypotheses for Anomalies

**Potential Root Causes:**

1. **Batch Processing Systems**: The RP pattern suggests claims might be bulk-approved at fixed intervals, possibly for low-value claims or specific claim types.

2. **Communication Infrastructure Issues**: The 7-day PN delay could indicate:
   - Manual notification processes with weekly batching
   - System integration failures between approval and notification systems
   - Resource constraints in customer service departments

3. **Premature Claim Closure**: The AC shortcut might represent:
   - Duplicate claim rejections
   - Claims closed due to incomplete documentation
   - Fraud detection auto-closures

4. **Process Violations**: The EN rapid transition bypasses approval, suggesting:
   - Unauthorized direct notifications
   - System configuration errors
   - Emergency procedures for specific claim types

### 3. SQL Verification Queries

**Query 1: Identify claims with abnormal RP timing**
```sql
WITH claim_receive_approve AS (
    SELECT 
        r.claim_id,
        r.timestamp as receive_time,
        p.timestamp as approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) as time_diff_seconds,
        c.claim_type,
        c.claim_amount
    FROM claim_events r
    JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    claim_type,
    claim_amount,
    time_diff_seconds/3600.0 as hours_to_approve,
    CASE 
        WHEN ABS(time_diff_seconds - 90000) > 3600 THEN 'ANOMALY'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as classification
FROM claim_receive_approve
WHERE ABS(time_diff_seconds - 90000) > 3600
ORDER BY time_diff_seconds DESC;
```

**Query 2: Investigate PN delays by resource and region**
```sql
WITH approve_notify_delays AS (
    SELECT 
        p.claim_id,
        p.timestamp as approve_time,
        n.timestamp as notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))/86400.0 as days_to_notify,
        p.resource as approver,
        n.resource as notifier,
        c.claim_type,
        adj.region
    FROM claim_events p
    JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
    LEFT JOIN claim_events a ON p.claim_id = a.claim_id AND a.activity = 'A'
    LEFT JOIN adjusters adj ON a.resource = adj.name
    WHERE p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    region,
    claim_type,
    AVG(days_to_notify) as avg_notification_delay,
    STDDEV(days_to_notify) as stdev_notification_delay,
    COUNT(*) as claim_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN days_to_notify > 9 THEN 1 END) as excessive_delays
FROM approve_notify_delays
GROUP BY region, claim_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY avg_notification_delay DESC;
```

**Query 3: Detect premature closures (AC without E or P)**
```sql
WITH claim_activity_paths AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.claim_id,
        STRING_AGG(ce.activity, '->' ORDER BY ce.timestamp) as activity_sequence,
        c.claim_amount,
        c.claim_type,
        MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) as assign_time,
        MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) as close_time
    FROM claim_events ce
    JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    activity_sequence,
    claim_type,
    claim_amount,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time))/3600.0 as hours_assign_to_close
FROM claim_activity_paths
WHERE activity_sequence LIKE '%A%C%'
    AND activity_sequence NOT LIKE '%A%E%C%'
    AND activity_sequence NOT LIKE '%A%P%C%'
ORDER BY hours_assign_to_close ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query 4: Analyze EN shortcuts bypassing approval**
```sql
WITH evaluate_notify_direct AS (
    SELECT 
        e.claim_id,
        e.timestamp as eval_time,
        n.timestamp as notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp))/60.0 as minutes_to_notify,
        e.resource as evaluator,
        c.claim_amount,
        c.claim_type,
        EXISTS(
            SELECT 1 FROM claim_events p 
            WHERE p.claim_id = e.claim_id 
            AND p.activity = 'P' 
            AND p.timestamp BETWEEN e.timestamp AND n.timestamp
        ) as has_approval
    FROM claim_events e
    JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE e.activity = 'E' 
        AND n.activity = 'N'
        AND n.timestamp > e.timestamp
)
SELECT 
    evaluator,
    claim_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_cases,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN NOT has_approval THEN 1 END) as skip_approval_count,
    AVG(CASE WHEN NOT has_approval THEN minutes_to_notify END) as avg_minutes_when_skipped,
    AVG(claim_amount) as avg_claim_amount
FROM evaluate_notify_direct
WHERE minutes_to_notify < 10
GROUP BY evaluator, claim_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY skip_approval_count DESC;
```

These queries will help identify specific patterns, resources, and claim characteristics associated with the temporal anomalies, enabling targeted process improvements and compliance investigations.
