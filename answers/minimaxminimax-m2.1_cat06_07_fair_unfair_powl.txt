The user is asking me to create two POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) models based on the description of a hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions.

The two models should be:
1. A model that includes potential unfairness (with the XOR branch for community affiliation check)
2. A model without unfairness (removing the biased branch)

Let me analyze the process description:

**Steps:**
1. Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check
2. Preliminary Skill Assessment
3. Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check (potential bias point)
4. Managerial Review & Final Decision

The process also mentions:
- Loop: for data completeness (if missing info, ask for more details)
- XOR: at the cultural fit stage (either standard evaluation OR community-affiliated path)

**For the unfair model:**
- Start with receiving application
- Data completeness check with loop (request more info if needed)
- Skill assessment
- XOR branching:
  - Path 1: Standard Cultural Fit Check
  - Path 2: Community Affiliation Check (biased path)
- After XOR: Managerial Review
- Final Decision

**For the fair model:**
- Same structure but without the biased branch
- All applicants go through the same Cultural Fit Check
- No community affiliation advantage

Let me now write the POWL models in the format specified, using Python-like syntax with pm4py library structure.

For the first model (with unfairness):
```python
# POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Loop for data completeness: Check then either request more info or proceed
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR for cultural fit evaluation paths
xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define root as a StrictPartialOrder with sequential execution
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, SkillAssessment, xor_cultural, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_cultural)
root.order.add_edge(xor_cultural, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

I'll continue modeling the workflow's control flow, focusing on the sequential execution and decision points. The model captures the hiring process with its key stages and potential bias points. The partial order ensures a structured progression through the application review stages, with a loop for data completeness and an XOR choice for cultural evaluation paths.

The next thinking continues the partial order definition, so I'll complete the thought by copying over the remaining part of the thinking to ensure continuity:

root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

The process flow now includes a standard cultural fit check as the exclusive alternative, removing the community affiliation check. This simplifies the decision logic while maintaining the core evaluation structure. The root partial order now represents a more streamlined workflow, with clear sequential dependencies between each stage of the hiring process.

# POWL Models for GlobalTeq Solutions Hiring Process

## 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model represents the hiring process with the problematic XOR branching that introduces subtle bias through the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities in the hiring process
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Loop structure for data completeness: Check data, then either request more info or proceed
# This implements the loop: DataCompletenessCheck  (RequestMoreInfo if incomplete, or skip if complete)
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP, 
    children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo]
)

# XOR branching at cultural fit evaluation stage - THIS IS THE BIAS POINT
# Applicants either go through standard cultural fit check OR community affiliation check
# The CommunityAffiliationCheck gives preferential treatment to locally affiliated candidates
xor_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR, 
    children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]
)

# Define the root as a StrictPartialOrder with sequential ordering
# All components must be executed in sequence: Receive  Loop  Skill  XOR  Review  Decision
root_with_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        ReceiveApplication,
        loop_data_completeness,
        SkillAssessment,
        xor_cultural_fit,
        ManagerialReview,
        FinalDecision
    ]
)

# Define execution order: each activity must complete before the next begins
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness)
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment)
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_cultural_fit)
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(xor_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview)
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation of Unfairness Points:**

The bias manifests at the XOR branch (`xor_cultural_fit`) where applicants follow different evaluation paths based on their community affiliations. Candidates who indicate membership in the "Global Business Leaders Club" or are flagged as local residents are routed through the `CommunityAffiliationCheck` activity, which provides a "subjective uplift" in their cultural alignment evaluation. This creates an unfair advantage because the evaluation criteria shift from pure merit-based assessment to one that rewards social connections and geographic proximity rather than objective qualifications.

## 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model removes the biased XOR branching, ensuring all applicants undergo the same standardized cultural fit evaluation process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define all activities - note: CommunityAffiliationCheck is REMOVED
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Loop structure for data completeness (unchanged)
# Ensures all applications have complete information before proceeding
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP, 
    children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo]
)

# Single cultural fit evaluation for ALL applicants - NO XOR branching
# All candidates receive the same standardized evaluation
cultural_fit_only = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[CulturalFitCheck],
    order={}
)

# Define the root as a StrictPartialOrder with sequential ordering
# Process flows: Receive  Loop  Skill  CulturalFit  Review  Decision
root_without_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        ReceiveApplication,
        loop_data_completeness,
        SkillAssessment,
        CulturalFitCheck,
        ManagerialReview,
        FinalDecision
    ]
)

# Define execution order: each activity must complete before the next begins
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness)
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment)
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation of Fairness Improvements:**

The key difference is the elimination of the XOR branching structure at the cultural fit evaluation stage. In this fair model, all applicants follow an identical evaluation path: after the skill assessment, every candidate proceeds to the same `CulturalFitCheck` activity with standardized criteria. There is no separate `CommunityAffiliationCheck` activity that could provide preferential treatment based on local affiliations or club memberships. This ensures that the hiring decision rests solely on objective qualifications and merit-based assessments, removing the potential for the subtle bias that existed in the first model.

| **CommunityAffiliationCheck** | Included as alternative path | Removed entirely |
| **Evaluation Paths** | Two different paths based on affiliations | Single standardized path for all |
| **Bias Source** | XOR branch routes affiliated candidates favorably | No routing based on affiliations |
| **Fairness** | Subtle disadvantage for non-affiliated candidates | Equal treatment for all applicants |
