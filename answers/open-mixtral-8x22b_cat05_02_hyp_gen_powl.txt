1. **Identified Anomalies:**

   - **Loop between Evaluation and Approval Activities:** The model allows for repeated evaluation and approval of claims, which may not be necessary or efficient. This anomaly can cause delays and lead to confusion.

   - **XOR with Skipping Customer Notification:** The XOR allows for skipping the customer notification step, which might result in poor customer experience and communication breakdowns.

   - **Partial Ordering Enabling Premature Closure of Claims:** The model's partial ordering allows claims to be closed before proper evaluation or approval, which could lead to inaccurate claim handling and potential financial losses.

2. **Hypotheses for Anomalies:**

   - **Changes in Business Rules:** Changes in business rules might have been partially implemented, causing the loop and the XOR skipping customer notification. The partial ordering might be a result of these changes as well.

   - **Miscommunication between Departments:** Miscommunication between departments might have led to an incomplete process design, resulting in the anomalies mentioned above.

   - **Technical Errors:** Technical errors in the workflow system might have allowed non-standard execution paths, causing the loop and the XOR skipping customer notification. The partial ordering might be a result of these technical errors as well.

   - **Inadequate Constraints or Controls:** The process modeler’s tool might have inadequate constraints or controls, leading to the creation of the anomalous structures in the model.

3. **Verification using Database Queries:**

   - **Claims Closed without Proper Evaluation or Approval:**
     ```sql
     SELECT c.claim_id
     FROM claims c
     JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
     WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
       AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                       FROM claim_events ce2
                       WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id
                         AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P'));
     ```

   - **Claims Approved Multiple Times:**
     ```sql
     SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) as approvals
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity = 'P'
     GROUP BY claim_id
     HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
     ```

   - **Frequency of Skipped Customer Notification:**
     ```sql
     SELECT
       COUNT(*) AS skipped_notifications,
       (COUNT(*) * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claim_events WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')) AS percentage_skipped
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity = 'P'
       AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                       FROM claim_events ce2
                       WHERE ce2.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
                         AND ce2.activity = 'N');
     ```
By running these queries, you can analyze the underlying data to verify the hypotheses and gain insights into the anomalies present in the process model.
