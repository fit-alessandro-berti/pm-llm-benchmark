Given the task to mitigate potential biases in the loan application review process, we will introduce several DECLARE constraints. These constraints aim to ensure fairness and consistency in the decision-making process, particularly around sensitive attributes. Below are the constraints we will add:

1. **Coexistence:** Ensure that a `ManualReview` always coexists with any decision steps (`Approve`, `Reject`) if the applicant is from a sensitive demographic (e.g., minority). This prevents automatic decisions based on sensitive attributes without proper review.
2. **Response and Succession Constraints:** Ensure that `Approve` or `Reject` cannot directly follow a sensitive attribute check (`CheckApplicantRace`) without a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity in between.
3. **Non-succession Constraints:** Prevent the direct succession from a sensitive attribute check (`CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision (`Reject`), ensuring that decisions are not made immediately after learning sensitive information.

Let's implement these constraints in the `declare_model` dictionary:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Explanation of Additions:**

- **Coexistence Constraints:** For `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`, we added coexistence constraints with `ManualReview`. This ensures that any decision affecting a minority applicant is subject to a manual review, reducing the chance of biased decisions.
- **Response Constraints:** We added a response constraint from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that a check on the applicant's race always leads to a bias mitigation step before any further action is taken.
- **Succession Constraints:** We added succession constraints that require `Approve` and `Reject` to be preceded by `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that decision-making actions are preceded by a fairness check.
- **Non-succession Constraints:** We added a non-succession constraint that prevents `CheckApplicantRace` from directly leading to `Reject`. This ensures that a decision to reject cannot be made immediately after identifying a sensitive attribute, thus reducing the risk of bias.

These constraints collectively aim to ensure that sensitive attributes do not unfairly influence decision-making in the loan application process.
