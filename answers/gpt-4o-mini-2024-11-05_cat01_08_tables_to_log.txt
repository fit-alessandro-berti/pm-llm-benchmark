### Assumptions:
1. **Order Dispatched and Order Arrived**: If an order has multiple deliveries, each delivery event (dispatch and arrival) is logged separately. Events for each shipment are listed sequentially.
2. **Multiple Invoices**: If an order generates multiple invoices, each invoice is logged as a separate event.
3. **Payment Received**: If an invoice has multiple payments, each payment event is logged separately.
