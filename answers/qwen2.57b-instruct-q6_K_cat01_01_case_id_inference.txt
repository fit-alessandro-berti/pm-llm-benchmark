To group the events into separate cases based on the provided attributes and their logical flow, we need to identify patterns that suggest distinct patient journeys. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I would approach this:

1. **Identify Patient Attributes:** Each event includes `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, which can help differentiate between patients.
2. **Sequence Analysis:** Analyze the sequence and timing of activities to group them logically.
3. **Department Transitions:** Notice changes in departments, as each department visit typically belongs to a single patient's case.

Let's start grouping the events:

### Case 1: Patient Age = 45, Male
- Event 1: Register patient (ER)
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER)
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology)
- Event 8: Lab test requested (ER)
- Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory)
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER)
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, again with a diagnosis from ER)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER)

### Case 2: Patient Age = 62, Female
- Event 2: Register patient (ER)
- Event 5: Initial triage (ER)
- Event 6: Lab test requested (ER) and then completed (Laboratory)
- Event 9: Doctor consultation (ER)
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER)
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER)

### Case 3: Patient Age = 28, Male
- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery)
- Event 6: Lab test requested (ER) and then completed (Laboratory)
- Event 9: Doctor consultation (ER)
- Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery)
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery)

Here is the final grouping:

#### Case 1:
```
1. Register patient, ER
4. Initial triage, ER
7. X-ray imaging, Radiology
8. Lab test requested, ER
10. Lab test completed, Laboratory
11. Doctor consultation, ER
12. Doctor consultation, ER
15. Patient discharged, ER
```

#### Case 2:
```
2. Register patient, ER
5. Initial triage, ER
6. Lab test requested, ER
9. Doctor consultation, ER
14. Prescription created, ER
17. Patient discharged, ER
```

#### Case 3:
```
3. Register patient, Surgery
6. Lab test requested, ER
9. Doctor consultation, ER
13. Surgery performed, Surgery
16. Recovery room, Surgery
18. Patient discharged, Surgery
```

These groupings are based on the logical flow of events for each patient and their corresponding departments, ensuring that all activities related to a specific patient are grouped together.
