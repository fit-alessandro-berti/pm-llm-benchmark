Below are two POWL models (in pm4py-style Python) that implement the described hiring workflow. The first model includes an XOR branch that can introduce subtle unfairness by routing some applicants through a CommunityAffiliationCheck that can give them an implicit advantage. The second model removes that XOR branch so every applicant goes through the same CulturalFitCheck (no special community-based branch).

Note: these snippets follow the structure of the example you provided (using Transition, OperatorPOWL, StrictPartialOrder and Operator).

Model 1 — POWL with potential unfairness (XOR branch for community affiliation):

import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Basic activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
# Loop to ensure data completeness: DataCompletenessCheck then either exit or RequestMoreInfo -> DataCompletenessCheck again
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# XOR branch: either standard CulturalFitCheck OR CommunityAffiliationCheck (this branch can introduce bias)
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_affiliation])

managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Root partial order: ReceiveApplication -> DataLoop -> SkillAssessment -> (CulturalFit XOR CommunityAffiliation) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_xor, managerial_review, final_decision])
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, managerial_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

(Explanation: the XOR operator between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck is where applicants with certain affiliations or local flags can be routed to the latter branch, which the description states gives an implicit uplift—this is the potential unfairness.)

Model 2 — POWL without unfairness (no community-based branch):

import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Basic activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
# Loop to ensure data completeness
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# Single, uniform cultural fit check for all applicants (no XOR branch)
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Root partial order: ReceiveApplication -> DataLoop -> SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assessment, cultural_fit, managerial_review, final_decision])
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

(Explanation: here every applicant passes through the same CulturalFitCheck; there is no XOR branch that could grant selective advantages based on community membership or local flags, removing that source of bias.)

If you want, I can also:
- Add a silent skip alternative to the data loop to model an immediate exit explicitly, or
- Annotate the XOR branch to show where the uplift/implicit advantage is applied, or
- Validate these POWL objects with pm4py utilities (if you want runnable verification).
