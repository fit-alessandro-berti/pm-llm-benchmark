What a delightfully complex process!

This appears to be a business process related to expense reimbursement or payment processing. I'll try to break it down and provide an overview of the process. Please note that some nuances might be lost in translation, and specific organizational details may vary.

**Main Process Flow:**

1. **Declaration Submission**: An employee submits a declaration ( expense report?) to the system.
2. **Administrative Review**: The declaration is reviewed and approved by an administrator ( ADMINISTRATION), or rejected and sent back to the employee.
3. **Pre-Approval and Budget Owner Review**: If approved by the administrator, the declaration is sent to a pre-approver (PRE_APPROVER) and/or a budget owner (BUDGET OWNER) for review. If approved by both, it moves forward.
4. **Supervisor Approval**: The declaration is then sent to a supervisor (SUPERVISOR) for final approval.
5. **Payment Request**: Once approved by the supervisor, a payment request is generated.
6. **Payment Handling**: The payment is then handled and processed.

**Rejection and Resubmission Flows:**

* If the declaration is rejected at any stage (by ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, or SUPERVISOR), it is sent back to the employee.
* The employee can resubmit the declaration after addressing the rejection reasons.

**Additional Paths and Loops:**

* **Missing** status: A declaration can be marked as "MISSING" ( Declaration REJECTED by MISSING), which might indicate a need for additional information or documentation. This status seems to be used to handle exceptions.
* **Saved** declarations: Some declarations are saved by employees without submitting them for review (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE).
* **Request Payment from Supervisor**: In rare cases, a supervisor can initiate a payment request directly (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment).

**Interesting Observations:**

* There are many variations of the process, with different approval routes and frequencies.
* The performance metrics (e.g., 273266.628) suggest that the process has been optimized for efficiency, with longer processing times associated with rejection and resubmission flows.
* Some transitions have low frequencies (e.g., 1 or 2), which might indicate exceptional cases or edge scenarios.

Overall, this process seems to be designed to handle the complexities of expense reimbursement, with multiple approval stages and rejection flows to ensure that only valid and correctly formatted declarations are processed and paid.
