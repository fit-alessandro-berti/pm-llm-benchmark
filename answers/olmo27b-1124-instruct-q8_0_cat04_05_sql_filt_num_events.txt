```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) c ON e.case_id = c.case_id AND e.event_count <= 6
```

Here's the explanation of the SQL query:

1. **Subquery for Grouping and Counting Events by Case ID**: 

   The subquery (`SELECT ... FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id`) groups the events by `case_id` and counts the number of events per case.

2. **Outer Query to Filter Cases with Six or Fewer Events**:

   The outer query (`SELECT e.* FROM event_log e JOIN ...`) joins this grouping result back to the original `event_log` table. It filters out cases where the count exceeds 6 by using the join condition `e.case_id = c.case_id AND e.event_count <= 6`.

3. **Returning Events from Cases with Six or Fewer Events**:

   The final result is a set of all events (`e.*`) from those cases that satisfy the condition of having 6 or fewer events.

This query correctly identifies and returns the events from cases that have six or fewer events, fulfilling the given task requirements.
