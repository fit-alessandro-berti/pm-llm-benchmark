#### **Assumptions & Rationale:**

1. **Case ID:** Each `order_id` is used as the unique case identifier for process mining.
2. **Activity Names:**
   - "Order Created" – for order table rows.
   - "Order Picked" – for when order lines are picked (based on picking date logic; multiple lines per order  one event if we treat the order as picked when first line is picked, or one event per line. Here, I used one event per order for simplicity).
   - "Order Dispatched" – mapped to the earliest dispatch date for each order (as a single shipment event, even if split into multiple deliveries).
   - "Order Arrived" – mapped to the arrival date of the delivery (first arrival if multiple, but here shown per delivery for completeness).
   - "Invoice Issued" – per invoice row.
   - "Payment Received" – per payment row.
3. **Timestamps:** 
   - For events with multiple possible timestamps (e.g., picking for an order with multiple items), I used the earliest or representative date for simplicity, but in a more detailed log, you might split into multiple events or aggregate as needed.
4. **Resource:** 
   - Assigned based on the responsible entity (sales person for order creation, warehouse staff for picking, billing person for invoice, payment person for payment, and carrier for delivery). When no direct mapping is available, resource is left blank.
5. **Order to Delivery Flow:** 
   - The sequence starts with the order creation, then picking, dispatch, arrival, invoice issuance, and finally payment.
6. **Multiple Deliveries per Order:** 
   - Each delivery's arrival is recorded as a separate event, but the dispatch is mapped to the first dispatch for simplicity (could be expanded for more granularity).
7. **Omissions:** 
   - Product descriptions, categories, or detailed picking staff per line item are not shown in the activity name or resource for brevity, but could be included in extended logs.
   - The "Resource" column is optional but added for completeness where possible.

**This log can be imported directly into most process mining tools (e.g., Celonis, Qlik Sense, UiPath Process Mining) or exported to CSV/Excel for analysis.**

If you need a CSV export or a more granular breakdown (e.g., one event per picked item), let me know!
