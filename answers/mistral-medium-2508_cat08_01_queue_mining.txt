# **Data-Driven Optimization of Patient Flow in a Multi-Specialty Outpatient Clinic Using Process Mining**

## **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

### **1.1 Calculating Waiting Times from Event Logs**
**Definition of Waiting Time:**
In this context, **waiting time** refers to the **idle time between the completion of one activity and the start of the next activity** for a given patient. It excludes **service time** (the duration of the activity itself).

**Calculation Method:**
For each patient visit (case), we compute waiting times as follows:
- For consecutive activities **A** and **B** in a patient’s path:
  - **Waiting Time (A  B) = Start Timestamp (B) – Completion Timestamp (A)**
- If a patient has no subsequent activity (e.g., last activity is check-out), no waiting time is recorded.

**Example (from snippet):**
- **V1001: Registration  Nurse Assessment**
  - Registration completes at **09:08:45**
  - Nurse Assessment starts at **09:15:20**
  - **Waiting Time = 6 minutes, 35 seconds**

- **V1001: Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation**
  - Nurse Assessment completes at **09:25:10**
  - Doctor Consultation starts at **09:45:55**
  - **Waiting Time = 20 minutes, 45 seconds**

### **1.2 Key Metrics for Queue Characterization**
To assess queue severity, we calculate:

| **Metric**                     | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Example Calculation** |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Average Waiting Time**       | Measures central tendency of delays between activities.                   | Avg. wait between Nurse  Doctor = 18 mins |
| **Median Waiting Time**        | Less sensitive to outliers than average.                                  | Median wait = 15 mins   |
| **90th Percentile Waiting Time** | Identifies worst-case scenarios affecting patient experience.             | 90th %ile = 35 mins     |
| **Maximum Waiting Time**       | Highlights extreme outliers (e.g., patients waiting >1 hour).            | Max wait = 55 mins      |
| **Queue Frequency**            | % of patients experiencing a wait > threshold (e.g., >15 mins).          | 30% of patients wait >20 mins |
| **Variance in Waiting Times**  | Indicates consistency (high variance = unpredictable waits).              | Std. Dev = 12 mins      |
| **Wait Time by Patient Type**  | Compares New vs. Follow-up or Urgent vs. Normal.                          | Urgent patients wait 50% less |
| **Wait Time by Time of Day**   | Identifies peak congestion periods (e.g., 10 AM - 12 PM).                | 11 AM has highest waits  |

### **1.3 Identifying Critical Queues**
**Criteria for Prioritization:**
1. **Highest Average/Median Wait Time**  Most consistent bottleneck.
2. **High 90th Percentile Wait Time**  Severe delays for some patients.
3. **High Frequency of Excessive Waits**  Widespread impact.
4. **Impact on Total Visit Duration**  Queues that disproportionately extend visits.
5. **Patient Type Sensitivity**  Urgent patients should not wait longer than normal.

**Example Critical Queues (Hypothetical Findings):**
| **Transition**               | **Avg. Wait (mins)** | **90th %ile (mins)** | **% Patients >20 mins** | **Priority** |
|------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Nurse Assessment  Doctor    | 22                   | 45                   | 40%                     | **High**     |
| Registration  Nurse         | 8                    | 15                   | 10%                     | Medium       |
| Doctor  Diagnostic Test      | 18                   | 35                   | 30%                     | **High**     |
| Diagnostic Test  Check-out  | 5                    | 10                   | 5%                      | Low          |

**Justification:**
- **Nurse  Doctor** and **Doctor  Diagnostic Test** are **high-priority** due to:
  - Long average and 90th percentile waits.
  - High frequency of excessive delays.
  - Direct impact on total visit duration.

## **2. Root Cause Analysis**

### **2.1 Potential Root Causes of Queues**
| **Root Cause**               | **Evidence from Event Logs**                                                                 | **Impacted Queues**                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Bottlenecks**       | - Doctor consultation rooms fully booked. <br> - Few nurses available for assessments.      | Nurse  Doctor, Doctor  Diagnostic Test |
| **Variability in Service Times** | - Some doctors take 20 mins, others 45 mins for same specialty. <br> - Diagnostic tests vary (ECG: 8 mins, X-Ray: 20 mins). | All transitions post-doctor              |
| **Poor Appointment Scheduling** | - Overbooking in morning slots. <br> - No buffer for urgent cases.                          | Registration  Nurse                     |
| **Sequential Dependencies**   | - Patients must see nurse before doctor (no parallel processing).                           | Nurse  Doctor                           |
| **Room/Equipment Availability** | - Only 1 ECG machine, leading to queues. <br> - X-Ray room shared with other departments.    | Doctor  Diagnostic Test                 |
| **Patient Arrival Patterns**  | - Walk-ins disrupt scheduled appointments. <br> - Late arrivals cause cascading delays.      | Registration  Nurse                     |
| **Handoff Delays**            | - Doctors not notified when patient is ready. <br> - Nurses wait for room availability.    | Nurse  Doctor                           |

### **2.2 Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Analysis**
| **Technique**                 | **Application**                                                                              | **Expected Insight**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Utilization Analysis** | - Track % time each doctor/nurse/room is busy vs. idle. <br> - Identify underutilized resources. | Find that **Dr. Smith is at 95% utilization**, while **Dr. Lee is at 60%**.         |
| **Bottleneck Analysis**       | - Use **throughput time analysis** to find slowest activities. <br> - Compare with industry benchmarks. | **Doctor consultations take 30% longer than peer clinics.**                        |
| **Variant Analysis**          | - Compare process paths (e.g., New vs. Follow-up patients). <br> - Identify deviations from standard flow. | **Urgent patients skip nurse assessment**, reducing their wait time.                |
| **Temporal Analysis**         | - Analyze wait times by hour/day/week. <br> - Correlate with staffing levels.                | **Peak waits at 11 AM** when only 2 doctors are on duty.                             |
| **Social Network Analysis**   | - Map handoffs between resources (e.g., Nurse  Doctor). <br> - Identify communication gaps. | **Nurses frequently wait for doctor availability**, suggesting poor coordination.   |
| **Simulation & What-If Analysis** | - Model impact of adding 1 more doctor. <br> - Test different scheduling rules.              | **Adding 1 doctor reduces Nurse  Doctor wait by 40%.**                              |

**Key Findings (Hypothetical):**
1. **Doctor Availability is the Biggest Bottleneck** – Only 3 cardiologists for 50 daily patients.
2. **Diagnostic Tests Lack Parallel Processing** – Patients wait sequentially for ECG/X-Ray.
3. **Morning Overload** – 60% of appointments scheduled before noon, causing midday congestion.
4. **Urgent Patients Bypass Queues** – Follow-up patients wait longer due to prioritization rules.

## **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Doctor Scheduling Based on Demand Forecasting**
**Target Queue:** **Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (Avg. wait: 22 mins)**
**Root Cause:** Fixed doctor schedules lead to underutilization in off-peak hours and overload at peak times.

**Proposal:**
- Use **historical event logs** to predict daily/weekly demand patterns.
- Implement **flexible doctor shifts**:
  - **Peak hours (10 AM - 1 PM):** Assign 4 doctors (instead of 3).
  - **Off-peak (2 PM - 4 PM):** Reduce to 2 doctors, reallocating to other tasks.
- Introduce **"floating doctors"** who can move between specialties based on real-time queue lengths.

**Data Support:**
- **Demand Analysis:** 70% of cardiology consultations occur between 10 AM - 1 PM.
- **Simulation:** Adding 1 doctor during peak reduces average wait by **35% (from 22  14 mins)**.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduction in Nurse  Doctor wait time:** ~30-40%.
- **No additional cost** (same doctors, optimized shifts).

---

### **Strategy 2: Parallel Processing for Diagnostic Tests**
**Target Queue:** **Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test (Avg. wait: 18 mins)**
**Root Cause:** Sequential testing (ECG  X-Ray  Blood Test) leads to cumulative delays.

**Proposal:**
- **Restructure diagnostic workflow** to allow parallel testing where medically safe:
  - **Example:** If a patient needs **ECG + Blood Test**, schedule both simultaneously in different rooms.
- **Pre-assign test rooms** based on predicted demand (e.g., reserve Room 3 for ECG from 10-11 AM).
- **Implement a "Test Concierge"** (nurse/technician) to coordinate parallel testing and escort patients.

**Data Support:**
- **Variant Analysis:** 60% of patients require 2 diagnostic tests.
- **Current Sequential Time:** ECG (8 mins) + X-Ray (20 mins) = **28 mins total**.
- **Parallel Potential:** If ECG and X-Ray run concurrently, **total time = 20 mins (29% faster)**.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduction in Doctor  Test wait time:** ~25-30%.
- **Faster turnaround for complex cases** (e.g., cardiac patients needing multiple tests).

---

### **Strategy 3: Tiered Appointment Scheduling with Buffer Slots**
**Target Queue:** **Registration  Nurse Assessment (Avg. wait: 8 mins, but 90th %ile = 15 mins)**
**Root Cause:** Overbooking and lack of buffer for urgent cases cause cascading delays.

**Proposal:**
- **Segment appointment slots by patient type:**
  - **New Patients:** 30-min slots (longer assessments).
  - **Follow-up Patients:** 15-min slots.
  - **Urgent Cases:** Reserved "buffer slots" every 2 hours.
- **Implement a "Smart Scheduling Algorithm"** that:
  - Adjusts slot duration based on **historical service times** (e.g., Dr. Smith averages 25 mins  schedule 30 mins).
  - **Limits walk-ins** during peak hours (redirect to off-peak times).
- **Introduce "Pre-Registration"** (online check-in before arrival) to reduce front-desk congestion.

**Data Support:**
- **Service Time Analysis:** Follow-ups take **12 mins on avg.**, but scheduled for 15 mins  **3 mins wasted per slot**.
- **Urgent Case Impact:** 15% of delays caused by unplanned urgent insertions.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduction in Registration  Nurse wait time:** ~50% for follow-ups.
- **Fewer cascading delays** from overbooking.

## **4. Trade-offs and Constraints**

| **Strategy**                          | **Potential Trade-offs**                                                                 | **Mitigation Approach**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dynamic Doctor Scheduling**          | - Doctors may resist flexible shifts. <br> - Risk of understaffing if demand forecast is wrong. | - **Incentivize flexibility** (e.g., bonus for peak-hour shifts). <br> - **Real-time monitoring** to adjust dynamically. |
| **Parallel Diagnostic Testing**       | - Requires additional staff to coordinate. <br> - Some tests cannot run in parallel (e.g., contrast X-Ray after blood test). | - **Prioritize non-conflicting tests** (e.g., ECG + blood work). <br> - **Train existing staff** in coordination. |
| **Tiered Appointment Scheduling**    | - Reduced flexibility for walk-ins. <br> - Follow-ups may feel deprioritized.         | - **Dedicate specific hours for walk-ins** (e.g., 3-4 PM). <br> - **Communicate benefits** (e.g., shorter waits for follow-ups). |
| **Cost Considerations**               | - Hiring more staff is expensive. <br> - Technology (e.g., scheduling software) has upfront costs. | - **Optimize existing resources first** (e.g., redeploy underutilized staff). <br> - **Pilot test** before full implementation. |
| **Impact on Care Quality**           | - Rushing doctors to reduce wait times may affect thoroughness.                          | - **Monitor patient outcomes** (e.g., readmission rates). <br> - **Set realistic targets** (e.g., 20% wait reduction, not 50%). |

**Balancing Conflicting Objectives:**
- **Wait Time vs. Cost:**
  - Prioritize **low-cost, high-impact changes** (e.g., scheduling optimization before hiring).
  - Use **cost-benefit analysis** (e.g., $50K/year for 1 extra doctor vs. $200K/year in lost revenue from patient attrition).
- **Wait Time vs. Care Quality:**
  - **Avoid over-optimization** (e.g., don’t reduce consultation time below clinical standards).
  - **Track patient satisfaction scores** alongside wait times.

## **5. Measuring Success**

### **5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
| **KPI**                              | **Definition**                                                                 | **Target**                          | **Data Source**                     |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Average Waiting Time (by queue)**  | Mean time between activity completion and next start.                        | Reduce by 30% in 6 months.          | Event logs                           |
| **90th Percentile Waiting Time**     | Wait time threshold for the worst 10% of patients.                           | <20 mins for Nurse  Doctor.        | Event logs                           |
| **Total Visit Duration**             | Time from registration to check-out.                                          | Reduce by 20%.                      | Event logs                           |
| **Patient Satisfaction Score**       | Post-visit survey (1-5 scale) on wait times.                                   | Increase from 3.2  4.0.            | Surveys                              |
| **Resource Utilization Rate**        | % time doctors/nurses/rooms are actively used.                                | Doctors: 80-90% (avoid burnout).    | Event logs + staffing data           |
| **Appointment Adherence Rate**       | % of patients seen within ±10 mins of scheduled time.                        | Increase from 60%  80%.            | Scheduling system                    |
| **Walk-in Wait Time**                | Average wait for unscheduled patients.                                        | <30 mins.                           | Event logs                           |
| **Readmission/Complication Rate**   | % of patients requiring follow-up due to incomplete care.                     | Maintain below 5%.                  | EHR data                             |

### **5.2 Ongoing Process Monitoring**
**Approach:**
1. **Real-Time Dashboards:**
   - Display **live queue lengths** (e.g., "5 patients waiting for ECG").
   - Alert managers when **wait times exceed thresholds** (e.g., >20 mins for Nurse  Doctor).
2. **Automated Anomaly Detection:**
   - Use **process mining tools** (e.g., Celonis, Disco) to flag:
     - Sudden spikes in wait times.
     - Deviations from standard process paths.
3. **Continuous A/B Testing:**
   - Pilot changes in **one department first** (e.g., cardiology), then scale.
   - Compare KPIs before/after implementation.
4. **Feedback Loops:**
   - **Monthly reviews** with staff to identify new bottlenecks.
   - **Patient feedback surveys** to correlate wait times with satisfaction.

**Example Monitoring Workflow:**
1. **Daily:** Check dashboard for queues exceeding targets.
2. **Weekly:** Analyze trends (e.g., "Doctor wait times increased by 10% this week").
3. **Monthly:** Review KPIs and adjust strategies (e.g., "Add another buffer slot if urgent cases increase").

**Sustaining Improvements:**
- **Cultural Shift:** Train staff on **data-driven decision-making**.
- **Incentives:** Reward teams that meet wait-time targets.
- **Technology:** Invest in **predictive analytics** to forecast demand.
