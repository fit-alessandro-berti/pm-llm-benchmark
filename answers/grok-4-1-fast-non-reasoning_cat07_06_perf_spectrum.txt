This visualization is a **stacked Sankey diagram** (also known as an alluvial diagram or parallel sets plot) showing the flow of some quantity (likely notifications or events) across four sequential stages over a time period from **2024-08-01** to **2024-08-31**. The x-axis represents time progression, divided into four evenly spaced columns labeled:

- **2024-08-01 to 2024-08-07**
- **2024-08-08 to 2024-08-14**
- **2024-08-15 to 2024-08-21**
- **2024-08-22 to 2024-08-31**

### Key Elements:
- **Nodes (vertical bars)**: Each column has two stacked gray bars representing **states**:
  | Top (larger) | Bottom (smaller) |
  |--------------|------------------|
  | **Send Fail** | **Send Success** |

- **Flows (bands)**:
  - **Gray bands** (thicker, upper flows): Represent **Send Success** persisting or transitioning between weeks. They show high continuity, with most volume staying in the "success" state week-over-week.
  - **Pink/red bands** (thinner, angled downward): Represent **Send Fail** volumes flowing from success states into failure states. These are most prominent in later weeks, indicating increasing failures.

### Overall Flow Pattern:
- **High success rate**: The vast majority of volume (~90-95%) remains in **Send Success** across all weeks, with thick gray bands dominating vertically.
- **Growing failures**: Pink failure flows start small in week 1, but **increase notably** in weeks 3-4:
  - Week 1  Week 2: Minimal pink leakage (~5% of total).
  - Week 2  Week 3: Pink bands thicken (~10-15%).
  - Week 3  Week 4: Largest pink flows (~20%+), especially from the top "Send Success" node.
- **No recovery**: Once volume enters **Send Fail**, it stays there (no upward gray flows from failure states).
- **Total volume**: Appears stable or slightly growing rightward, suggesting consistent input scale.

### Interpretation:
This likely tracks **email/SMS/notification delivery** (given "Send" terminology), revealing a **degrading reliability trend** over August 2024. Success holds strong initially but erodes progressively, with ~20%+ failure rate by month-end. Possible causes: increasing bounce rates, API limits, or recipient issues accumulating over time. Ideal for alerting on delivery degradation.
