There are several factors that could contribute to the performance issues in this process, including:

1. Frequency and number of events: The frequency and number of events in this process are very high, which can lead to slow response times and increased processing time. It's important to optimize these parameters to minimize the impact on performance.
2. Duration: The duration of each event in this process is also relatively long, which could indicate that processes or resources may be idle for extended periods of time. This could potentially be addressed by reducing the number of events per transaction, increasing resource efficiency, or optimizing workflows to reduce idle times.
3. Object type: The object type used in this process (i.e., packages) may also play a role in performance. It's important to ensure that the object type is appropriate for the specific process and that resources are allocated accordingly.
4. Data specific considerations: Depending on the data used in this process, additional optimization may be necessary. For example, if the data is stored or transferred in large amounts or requires complex algorithms, additional measures may need to be taken to reduce processing time and optimize performance.
