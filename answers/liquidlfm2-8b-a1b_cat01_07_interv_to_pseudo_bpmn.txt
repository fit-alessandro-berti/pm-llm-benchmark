=== BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Accounts Payable Invoice Approval Process ===

**Diagram Title:** Accounts Payable Invoice Approval Workflow  
**View:** Transactional Process with decision points and role-handling  

1. **Activity: Receive Invoice**  
   - *From:* Supplier  
   - *Triggers:* Invoice arrives via email  
   - Action:  
     - Check for valid PO number.  
     - If no PO: Reject invoice; notify supplier to resend with PO.  
     - If PO present: Log invoice into accounting system.  
   - *Output:* Invoice with PO reference (if valid).

2. **Activity: Confirm Goods Received**  
   - *From:* Mary (AP Clerk)  
   - Input: Invoice + PO (if valid)  
   - Action: Forward invoice to Purchasing for goods receipt confirmation.  
   - Trigger: Invoice matched to PO in system.  
   - Output: Confirmation from Purchasing department (ID: M-001, PO-001) — "Goods received."

3. **Activity: Match Invoice to PO (Confirmation Phase)**  
   - *From:* Dan (Purchasing)  
   - Input: Invoice, PO  
   - Action: Validate quantities, prices, delivery charges.  
   - Exception:  
     - If discrepancy detected  notify supplier or request correction.  
     - If PO invalid or missing  escalate to Mary or Purchasing.  
   - Output: Invoice matched to PO (if valid), or flagged for correction.

4. **Gateway: Approval Trigger (Manager)**  
   - Branch on:  
     - PO confirmed + goods received  *Yes* (proceed to approval)  
     - PO missing/mismatched  *No* (wait for clarification)  

5. **Activity: Submit for Manager Approval**  
   - *From:* Dan or automated system (via notification)  
   - Input: Invoice + PO + confirmation evidence  
   - Action: Circulate for formal approval.  
   - Output: Approval/Rejection status returned.

6. **Gateway: Approval Outcome**  
   - Branch:  
     - Approved  Next: go to Payment scheduling.  
     - Conflict or within exception window  escalate to Rita (Supervisor) for resolution.

7. **Activity: Manager (Rita) Handles Exception & Resolution**  
   - Input: Discrepant or unresolved invoice  
   - Action:  
     - Contact supplier or internal departments.  
     - Create retroactive PO or issue rejection if invalid.  
     - Reboot normal workflow upon resolution.  
     - Feed cleared invoice back into the process.  
   - Output: Invoice cleared for payment routing.

8. **Activity: Routing to Accounts Payable for Payment Scheduling**  
   - *From:* Rita or AP (after exception resolution)  
   - Input: Fully approved invoice  
   - Action: Schedule payment in system.  
   - Output: Invoice added to payment run.

**Roles Summary:**  
- **Mary (AP Clerk):** Validates PO viability, logs invoice, forwards for goods confirmation, escalates delays.  
- **Dan (Purchasing):** Validates data, confirms receipt, approves PO alignment.  
- **Carlos (Manager):** Final approval gatekeeper; approves confirmed invoices.  
- **Rita (Supervisor):** Exception handler; resolves unresolved or contested invoices.  
- **Karen (Supplier Relationship):** Supports by providing missing PO or contract terms; facilitates communication.

---

**Artifacts:**  
- Invoice document (with PO reference)  
- Purchase Order number  
- Delivery confirmation from supplier  

---

**Exceptions & Variations Observed:**  
- Invoices <alone> (no PO)  automatically rejected; supplier must resend.  
- Missing PO triggers late-stage hold; escalation to Rita required.  
- Discrepancies (pricing, quantity, missing line items)  dialog with supplier or internal teams; may lead to rechallenge.  
- Infrequent manual review (Rita handles ~5–10% of exceptions).  
- Purchasing confirms "cleared" state for payment — no independent ART finish-to-start pathway.

---

**Notes:**  
- Process relies heavily on PO integrity; no approvals without valid PO linkage.  
- Escalations are rare but degrade to Rita for resolution; rare in routine cases.  
- No direct approval by frontline staff; gatekeeping role is centralized at Manager.  
- Supplier involvement is reactive—mainly triggered by invoice discrepancies or missing documentation.
