### Explanation of Added Constraints and Their Impact on Bias

1. **Coexistence Constraints for `ManualReview` and Minority Decision Steps:**
   - *Rationale*: If any special-case decision involving a sensitive demographic (such as `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`) happens, we require a `ManualReview` to have occurred (and vice versa). This ensures such decisions are reviewed by a human, reducing risk of automatic bias.
2. **Response and Succession Constraints for `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - *Rationale*: When an applicant's sensitive attribute is checked (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur before any decision. Decision steps (`Approve`, `Reject`, and their `_Minority` versions) require a preceding `BiasMitigationCheck`, ensuring a fairness evaluation before critical decisions.
3. **Non-succession and Non-chain Succession Constraints:**
   - *Rationale*: Direct succession from a sensitive attribute check (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision (`Approve`, `Reject`, etc.) is forbidden. There must always be at least one intervening step (such as `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`), breaking any direct link and thus preventing biased fast-tracking based on sensitive information.
4. **Existence Constraints for `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - *Rationale*: These steps must occur in the process whenever certain actions with sensitive implications happen, ensuring fairness controls are not skipped.

**Summary:**  
These constraints structurally ensure that decisions cannot be made directly after viewing sensitive attributes and require explicit fairness checks and human reviews for decisions on minority applicants. This makes it significantly less likely for biased, automated, or rushed decisions to occur, promoting a more equitable loan application process.
