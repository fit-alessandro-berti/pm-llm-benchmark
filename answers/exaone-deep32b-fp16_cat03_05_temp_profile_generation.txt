Okay, I need to create a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the supply chain process. The key is to list all possible pairs of activities that can follow each other in any order across the process executions, even if they're not directly adjacent. The values are their average time and standard deviation. The user mentioned not to use explicit numbers from the prompt, so I have to estimate them based on the activity descriptions.

First, let me list all the activities in order as given: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. The pairs should include all possible combinations where one activity comes after another in any trace. But since the problem says "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution", so even if they are separated by steps, like SS followed by QI, as long as in some execution SS comes before QI, that pair is considered.

Wait, but the example given in the problem uses pairs like (A,B), (A,C) etc. from the trace <A,B,C,D>, so all possible pairs where the first comes before the second in the trace. So for the supply chain process, all ordered pairs (X,Y) where X occurs before Y in at least one execution. Since the process has a typical sequence, but there might be variations. However, the problem says "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution", so even if in some path X comes before Y, even if in another path Y comes before X, but as long as there's at least one where X is before Y, then (X,Y) is a key.

But the problem says "couples of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution". So the direction matters here. So for example, if in some execution SS comes before OP, then (SS, OP) is a pair. But if in another execution OP comes before SS (unlikely here, but possible?), then (OP, SS) would also be a pair. But given the process steps, the order is probably fixed in most cases. Let me think about the typical flow.

The standard process steps are SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS. But maybe there are variations. For example, maybe after receiving components (RC), there could be some back and forth? Like if QI fails, maybe they have to go back to procurement? But the problem states "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution", so even if in some path they are in order, even if not in others, the pair is included. However, the problem says "the pairs ... that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution". So the key is that in at least one execution, the first activity comes before the second. So all possible ordered pairs where X comes before Y in at least one trace.

But given that the process is a supply chain, the typical path is linear. So the main path is SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS. So any pair where X is earlier in this sequence than Y would have (X,Y) as a possible pair. However, there might be other paths where steps are out of order. For example, maybe after QI, there's a loop back to RC if components are rejected, but that would create pairs like QI followed by RC again. But the problem says "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution", so even if in some execution they are in order, even if not in the main path, they should be included. However, since the user says "the process involves multiple steps spanning procurement, inspection, etc." and the activities are listed in order, perhaps the main path is the standard, and variations are minimal. But to be safe, I should consider all possible ordered pairs where X comes before Y in the main sequence, plus any possible variations that might exist in some executions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider all possible pairs where the first activity is before the second in the given list, assuming that the process follows the order as listed. Because the activities are listed in the order they typically occur. So the list given in the problem is the order of the process steps. So the main path is SS first, then OP, then RC, etc. So any pair (X,Y) where X is earlier in the list than Y would be part of the temporal profile. Because in the main execution, they are in that order, so they must be considered. Additionally, there might be other pairs from different paths, but since the problem says "eventually follow each other in at least one process execution", perhaps the main path is sufficient for the majority of pairs, and the problem expects us to model those.

Therefore, the total number of pairs would be all combinations where the first activity comes before the second in the list. Let's count the activities: there are 10 activities. The list is SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. So the indices are 0 to 9. The number of ordered pairs where i < j is 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. But the problem says "a representative subset" so maybe not all, but a selection that includes some with multiple steps apart. The example given in the problem includes pairs like (A,B), (A,C), etc., so they want pairs that are not just adjacent. So the answer should include some pairs that are separated by several steps.

Now, the task is to assign average and standard deviation for each pair. Since the user says not to use explicit numbers from the prompt, but to estimate based on the activity descriptions. Let's think of each pair's average time based on the steps between them.

Let me list the activities in order and think of possible time differences between them. Let's start by considering the typical durations between each adjacent pair, then the non-adjacent pairs would be the sum of the intermediate steps plus some variation.

First, let's outline the adjacent pairs and their possible average times and stds:

SS to OP: Supplier selection to order placement. This might be quick, maybe a day? Or perhaps the order placement is immediate after selection, so maybe 1 hour? But maybe supplier selection could take a day, but the order placement is the next day. Hmm, perhaps the time between SS and OP is short, like 1 day (assuming they decide and place order the next day). But maybe it's same day? Let's think:

SS (Supplier Selection) to OP (Order Placement): Probably same day, so maybe 1 day (86400 sec). But maybe even within the same day, so 8 hours (28800 sec). Let's say 86400 (1 day) as average, with some variation. But maybe the standard deviation is low here, since it's a decision made quickly once selected.

OP to RC (Receive Components): The lead time from supplier can vary. Let's say average 5 days (5*86400=432000 sec), with a high std, maybe 2 days (so 36000? Wait, standard deviation in seconds. Let's see. Let's think in days for easier conversion. Suppose average 5 days, std dev 1 day (86400 sec). So (432000, 86400).

RC to QI: Quality inspection might take a day or so. Let's say 1 day (86400), std dev 0.5 days (43200).

QI to CA: Assembly could take a few days. Maybe 3 days (3*86400=259200), std dev 1 day (86400).

CA to PT: Testing might take a day (86400), std dev 0.5 days.

PT to PK: Packaging same day? 86400, std dev low, like 2000?

PK to WS: Storing in warehouse maybe same day, so 86400, but perhaps overnight, so same day. Std dev low.

WS to DT: Distribution could take a few days. Let's say 3 days (259200), std dev 1 day.

DT to AS: After sales support might start after distribution. The time between distribution and AS could be variable, maybe depends on when a problem occurs. Let's say average 10 days (864000 sec), with high std, like 5 days (432000). But maybe that's too much. Alternatively, maybe the time between DT and AS is not directly related, but since AS comes after DT, perhaps the average is a month (30 days?), but maybe that's stretching. Alternatively, perhaps the time between DT and AS is variable but with a lower average, like 1 week (7 days = 604800 sec), std dev 3 days (259200). Hmm, but this is getting into specifics. Since the problem says to estimate, perhaps I can make up reasonable numbers based on the activity descriptions.

Now, for non-adjacent pairs, their average time would be the sum of the intermediate steps plus their own. For example, SS to RC would be SSOPRC. The average would be (SS-OP avg) + (OP-RC avg). The standard deviation would be sqrt( (sd1)^2 + (sd2)^2 ), assuming independence. But maybe the problem expects simpler estimates, perhaps just taking the sum of averages and sum of stds? Or maybe just approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the standard deviation can be similar to adjacent steps, but maybe scaled. Alternatively, just assign the standard deviation as a fixed value for each pair, but that might not be accurate. Since the problem says "estimate", perhaps the exact calculation isn't needed, just plausible numbers.

Let me start building the dictionary with some key pairs, including those separated by multiple steps.

First, the adjacent pairs:

('SS', 'OP'): Let's say average 1 day (86400), std 3600 (1 hour). Because once supplier is selected, order is placed next day, but maybe some variation (like same day or next week? Maybe the std is 1 day? Wait, 3600 is 1 hour. Hmm, maybe the order placement is same day as selection, so average 0.5 days (43200 sec), std 1 hour. Alternatively, maybe the selection and order are same day, so 8 hours (28800), std 2 hours (7200). Not sure. Let me think again. Supplier selection might take a day (like negotiating), then order the next day. So 1 day (86400) average. The std could be 1 day (36000? Wait 1 day is 86400. Wait, maybe the standard deviation is 1/3 of the average? Let's see. Let's go with 86400 and 3600 (so 1/24 of average? Not sure, but maybe the problem expects round numbers.)

Alternatively, perhaps the SS to OP is 1 day (86400) with std 3600 (1 hour). That's the example given in the problem's first example, so maybe that's a good model.

Then OP to RC: Let's say average 5 days (5*86400=432000), std 1 day (86400). So (432000, 86400).

RC to QI: 1 day (86400), std 0.5 days (43200). So (86400, 43200).

QI to CA: 3 days (259200), std 1 day (86400).

CA to PT: 1 day (86400), std 0.5 days (43200).

PT to PK: 1 day (86400), std 2000 (maybe 2 hours? 7200? Let's say 7200).

PK to WS: same day, so 86400, std 7200? Or maybe even lower, like 1 hour (3600). Let's say (86400, 3600).

WS to DT: Distribution might take 3 days (259200), std 1 day (86400).

DT to AS: Let's say average 10 days (864000), std 5 days (432000). Hmm, that's a big std, but maybe possible.

Now, for non-adjacent pairs:

Take SS to RC: the path is SSOPRC. The average would be 86400 (SS-OP) + 432000 (OP-RC) = 518400. The std would be sqrt( (86400)^2 + (86400)^2 )? Wait, the standard deviations of the individual steps are 3600 (for SS-OP) and 86400 (for OP-RC). Wait, no, the SS-OP's std is 3600, OP-RC's std is 86400. So the total variance would be (3600)^2 + (86400)^2, so the std is sqrt( (36002 + 864002) ). That's a big number. But maybe for simplicity, the problem expects us to just add the stds? Or perhaps approximate. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to just use the sum of averages and sum of stds. Let me see:

Alternatively, maybe the standard deviation for non-adjacent pairs can be the sum of the individual stds. But that might overestimate. Alternatively, perhaps the standard deviation is the sqrt of the sum of squares. However, since the problem says "estimate", perhaps just use the sum of the stds for simplicity. Let me proceed with that for now, but maybe just make some educated guesses.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deviation for SS to RC would be the same as the largest component, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to just pick a reasonable number without complex calculations. Let's proceed with the sum of the stds for adjacent steps between them. For SS to RC:

Average: 86400 + 432000 = 518400 sec (6.3 days)

Std: 3600 (from SS-OP) + 86400 (from OP-RC) = 90000. So (518400, 90000). Hmm, but that's a big std. Alternatively, maybe the OP-RC has a larger variability, so the total std is dominated by that. Alternatively, maybe the OP-RC's std is 86400 (1 day), so the total std would be sqrt( (3600)^2 + (86400)^2 )  sqrt( (86400)^2 (1 + (3600/86400)^2 ))  86400 * sqrt(1 + (1/24)^2 )  ~86400 * 1.002, so approx 86400. So maybe the std is around 86400. So perhaps for SS to RC, the average is 518400, std 86400. But maybe that's complicating. Since the problem allows estimation, perhaps just use the sum of the stds for adjacent steps. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to just make up numbers that are plausible, even if not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this answer, I can just assign the average as the sum of the intermediate steps' averages, and the standard deviation as the sum of their standard deviations. Let's proceed with that approach for simplicity.

Let me start building the dictionary with some key pairs. The problem says to include a representative subset, so maybe not all 45 pairs, but enough to show some complexity.

Let's list some pairs:

Adjacent pairs first:

('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600)
('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400)
('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200)
('QI', 'CA'): (259200, 86400)
('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200)
('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 7200)
('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 3600)
('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400)
('DT', 'AS'): (864000, 432000)

Now non-adjacent pairs:

SS to OP is adjacent, but SS to RC would be next. Let's do:

('SS', 'RC'): 86400+432000 = 518400; std 3600+86400 = 90000  (518400, 90000)

SS to QI: SSOPRCQI. Average: 86400 +432000 +86400 = 505200. Std: 3600 +86400 +43200 = 133440  (505200, 133440). Hmm, but maybe that's too precise. Alternatively, maybe the std is the sum of individual stds. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to just pick numbers that make sense, even if not exact. Alternatively, maybe the standard deviation for SS to QI is the same as the sum of the stds of the steps between them. Let's proceed.

Another pair: OP to QI. OPRCQI. Average: 432000 +86400 = 518400. Std: 86400 (OP-RC) +43200 (RC-QI)  129600. So (518400, 129600).

QI to WS: QICAPTPKWS. Let's see steps: QI to CA is 259200, CA-PT 86400, PT-PK 86400, PK-WS 86400. Total average: 259200 +86400*3 = 259200 +259200 = 518400. Std would be sqrt( (86400)^2 (for QI-CA's std 86400) plus (43200)^2 (QI-CA's std?), wait no. Wait QI to CA's std is 86400 (from earlier). Then CA to PT's std is 43200, PT-PK 7200, PK-WS 3600. So total variance would be (86400)^2 + (43200)^2 + (7200)^2 + (3600)^2. That's complicated. Maybe just sum the stds: 86400 +43200 +7200 +3600 = 140400. So (518400, 140400). But this is getting too involved. Maybe the problem expects simpler numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the standard deviation for QI to WS is the sum of the stds of the steps between them. Let's proceed with that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to just make up numbers that are plausible. Let's think of some other pairs.

Another important pair: RC to DT. The path RCQICAPTPKWSDT. The average would be:

RC to QI: 86400, QI-CA:259200, CA-PT:86400, PT-PK:86400, PK-WS:86400, WS-DT:259200. Adding all those: 86400 +259200 = 345600; +86400=432000; +86400=518400; +86400=604800; +259200= 864000. So total average 864000 seconds (10 days). The std would be sum of each step's std: 43200 (RC-QI) +86400 (QI-CA) +43200 (CA-PT) +7200 (PT-PK) +3600 (PK-WS) +86400 (WS-DT). Adding those: 43200 +86400 = 129600; +43200=172800; +7200=180000; +3600=183600; +86400=270000. So total std 270,000. So (864000, 270000). Hmm, but that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to use the maximum or some other approach. Alternatively, perhaps the DT is after WS, so the time from RC to DT is the sum of all steps from RC to DT. But maybe the average is 10 days (864000) and std is 5 days (432000). That might be simpler. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this answer, I can just pick some pairs and assign numbers that make sense, even if not strictly calculated. Let's proceed with that.

Let me list some key pairs with their averages and stds:

Adjacent pairs as before.

Now, some non-adjacent pairs:

('SS', 'QI'): The path SSOPRCQI. Average: 86400 (SS-OP) +432000 (OP-RC) +86400 (RC-QI) = 505200 sec (5.85 days). Std: 3600 (SS-OP) +86400 (OP-RC) +43200 (RC-QI) = 133440. So (505200, 133440). But maybe round to 505000 and 133000? Or perhaps 504000 (exactly 6 days) and 130000? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the average is 6 days (518400?), but perhaps I need to recalculate. Wait 86400 +432000 is 518400, plus 86400 (RC-QI) gives 604800? Wait no, SS to OP is 86400, OP to RC is 432000, RC to QI is 86400. Total is 86400 +432000 = 518400 +86400 = 604800. Oh right, I miscalculated earlier. So 604800 seconds (7 days). So average 604800, std 3600+86400+43200 = 133440. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to use the example's style where numbers are round. Let's see the example given:

In the example, ('A','B') has (86400, 3600), which is 1 day and 1 hour. So perhaps the numbers are in days and hours. Let's try to use similar conventions.

Let me try to re-express the adjacent pairs with that in mind:

SS to OP: 1 day (86400), std 1 hour (3600)  matches the example.

OP to RC: Let's say 5 days (432000), std 1 day (86400). That's 5 days average, 1 day std.

RC to QI: 1 day (86400), std 0.5 days (43200).

QI to CA: 3 days (259200), std 1 day (86400).

CA to PT: 1 day (86400), std 0.5 days (43200).

PT to PK: 1 day (86400), std 0.5 hours (1800? Or 1 hour 3600). Let's say 1 hour (3600).

PK to WS: 1 day (86400), std 1 hour (3600).

WS to DT: 3 days (259200), std 1 day (86400).

DT to AS: 10 days (864000), std 5 days (432000). Hmm, that's a big std, but maybe acceptable.

Now for non-adjacent pairs:

SS to RC: 1 (SS-OP) +5 (OP-RC) = 6 days  6*86400=518400. Std: sqrt( (1)^2 + (5's std 1)^2 )? Wait, no. The std for SS-OP is 1 hour (0.000347 days?), but perhaps better to think in days for std. Let's think in days for averages and stds:

SS-OP: avg 1 day, std 0.01 days (1 hour is 1/24 0.0417 days? Wait 1 hour is 1/24 days. So 3600 sec is 0.041666 days. Hmm, maybe better to keep in seconds for calculations.

Alternatively, let's proceed with the numbers as before.

SS to RC: average 6 days (518400), std would be sqrt( (1)^2 + (5's std 1)^2 )? Wait, the std for SS-OP is 1 hour (0.0417 days), and OP-RC's std is 1 day. So total variance is (0.0417)^2 + (1)^2  1.0018, so std 1.0009 days. So approx 1 day. But that's not right. Wait, the standard deviation of the sum of two independent variables is sqrt(12 + 22). So for SS-OP's  is 1 hour (3600 sec), OP-RC's  is 86400 (1 day). So total  is sqrt(36002 + 864002)  sqrt( (86400)^2 (1 + (3600/86400)^2 ))  86400 * sqrt(1 + (1/24)^2)  86400 * ~1.0002  ~86400. So the std is dominated by the OP-RC's std. So the std for SSRC would be approximately 86400 (1 day). So the pair (SS, RC) would be (518400, 86400).

Similarly, OP to QI: OPRCQI. The average is 5 +1 =6 days (518400). The std is sqrt( (1 (OP-RC's std) )2 + (0.5 days (RC-QI's std 43200 sec is 0.5 days) )2 ). Wait, RC-QI's std is 43200 sec which is 0.5 days. So the std for OP-RC is 1 day, RC-QI is 0.5 days. So total  is sqrt(12 +0.52) = sqrt(1.25) 1.118 days  1.118 *86400  96720 sec. So (518400, ~96720). But maybe round to 518400 and 96000? Or approximate to 518400 and 96000.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to just use the sum of the stds. 1 +0.5 =1.5 days  1.5*86400=129600. So (518400, 129600). Hmm, but that's a different approach. Since the problem allows estimation, perhaps the sum is easier.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to just pick numbers that are plausible, even if not exact. Let's proceed with the sum approach for simplicity.

Continuing:

Another pair: QI to DT. The path QICAPTPKWSDT. The average would be 3 (QI-CA) +1 (CA-PT) +1 (PT-PK) +1 (PK-WS) +3 (WS-DT)  total 3+1+1+1+3=9 days  9*86400=777600. The std would be 1 (QI-CA) +0.5 (CA-PT) +0.5 (PT-PK) +0.25 (PK-WS?) Wait, let's check each step's std:

QI-CA: 1 day (86400)
CA-PT: 0.5 days (43200)
PT-PK: 1 hour (3600  0.0417 days)
PK-WS: 0.25 days (2 hours  7200 sec? Wait earlier I had PK-WS as 3600 (1 hour). Let's recheck:

Earlier for PK to WS, I said (86400, 3600). So the std is 3600 sec (1 hour  0.0417 days). So the steps' stds:

QI-CA: 86400 (1 day)
CA-PT: 43200 (0.5 days)
PT-PK: 3600 (0.0417 days)
PK-WS: 3600 (0.0417 days)
WS-DT: 86400 (1 day)

Adding all stds: 86400 +43200 =129600; +3600=133200; +3600=136800; +86400=223200. So total std 223200 sec (2.575 days). So the pair (QI, DT) would be (777600, 223200). Hmm, but that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to use the sum of the stds for each step. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants a subset, so I can pick some key pairs and assign numbers.

Let me try to compile the dictionary with some selected pairs, including some that are not adjacent and have varying distances.

Here's a possible list:

1. ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600)
2. ('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400)
3. ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200)
4. ('QI', 'CA'): (259200, 86400)
5. ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200)
6. ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 3600)
7. ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 3600)
8. ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400)
9. ('DT', 'AS'): (864000, 432000)
   
Now non-adjacent pairs:

10. ('SS', 'QI'): 6 days (518400), std 1 (SS-OP) +1 (OP-RC) +0.5 (RC-QI)  sum 2.5 days  2.5*86400=216000  but earlier calculation with sum of stds would be 1+1+0.5=2.5 days  216000. So (518400, 216000)
Wait, but earlier when calculating the average for SS to QI is 1+5+1 =7 days? Wait no, OP to RC is 5 days, so SS to OP is 1, OP to RC is 5, RC to QI is 1  total 7 days (7*86400=604800). Oh right, I made a mistake earlier. So the average for SSQI is 1+5+1=7 days  604800. The stds are 1 (SS-OP) +1 (OP-RC) +0.5 (RC-QI)  total 2.5 days  216000. So (604800, 216000).

11. ('SS', 'CA'): SSOPRCQICA. Average: 1+5+1+3=10 days  864000. Std: 1+1+0.5 +1 (QI-CA's std is 1 day?) Wait QI-CA's std was 43200 (0.5 days). Wait earlier for QI to CA, I had (259200, 86400). Wait no, in the adjacent QI-CA pair, the std was 86400? Wait let me recheck:

Wait earlier for QI to CA, I had:

('QI', 'CA'): (259200, 86400). So the std is 86400 (1 day). Oh right! I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.

Wait in the adjacent pairs:

QI to CA: I had written (259200, 86400). So the std is 86400 (1 day). So the RC to QI's std was 43200 (0.5 days). So for SSQI:

SS-OP (1 day, 1 hour std  0.0417 days?), but in terms of the std in seconds, it's 3600 (0.0417 days). Wait no, the SS-OP's std is 3600 seconds (1 hour), which is 0.041666 days. But the OP-RC's std is 86400 (1 day), and RC-QI's std is 43200 (0.5 days). So the total variance is (3600)^2 + (86400)^2 + (43200)^2. Let's compute that:

36002 = 12,960,000

864002 = 7,464,960,000

432002 = 1,866,240,000

Total variance: 12,960k +7,464,960k +1,866,240k = approx 10,457,200,000. Square root of that is sqrt(1.04572e10)  102,260 seconds. So the std is ~102,260 sec (~1.18 days). Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Since the problem allows estimation, perhaps for SSQI, the average is 7 days (604800), and the std is approximately 1 day (86400). So (604800, 86400). Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to just use the sum of the stds of the steps: 3600 (SS-OP) +86400 (OP-RC) +43200 (RC-QI) = 133440 sec (1.54 days). So (604800, 133440). But this is getting too detailed. Maybe it's better to pick round numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to just make up numbers that are plausible, even if not exact. Let's proceed with:

('SS', 'QI'): (604800, 86400)  7 days, 1 day std.

Another pair: OP to PT. The path OPRCQICAPT. The average would be 5 (OP-RC) +1 (RC-QI) +3 (QI-CA) +1 (CA-PT)  total 10 days (864000). The std would be 1 (OP-RC) +0.5 (RC-QI) +1 (QI-CA) +0.5 (CA-PT)  total 3 days  259200. So (864000, 259200).

Another pair: RC to DT. RCQICAPTPKWSDT. The average is 1 (RC-QI) +3 (QI-CA) +1 (CA-PT) +1 (PT-PK) +1 (PK-WS) +3 (WS-DT)  total 1+3=4, +1=5, +1=6, +1=7, +3=10 days  864000*10=8,640,000. The std would be 0.5 (RC-QI's 43200) +1 (QI-CA) +0.5 (CA-PT) +0.5 (PT-PK's 3600  0.0417 days? Wait PT-PK's std was 3600 (1 hour  0.0417 days). Wait earlier for PT-PK, I had (86400, 3600). So the std is 3600 sec (0.0417 days). So adding all stds:

RC-QI: 43200 (0.5 days)
QI-CA: 86400 (1)
CA-PT:43200 (0.5)
PT-PK:3600 (0.0417)
PK-WS:3600 (0.0417)
WS-DT:86400 (1)
Total in days: 0.5 +1 +0.5 +0.0417 +0.0417 +1 = 3.0834 days  3.0834 *86400  266,400 sec. So the std would be approximately 266,400. But this is getting too precise. Maybe round to 259200 (3 days). So (8640000, 259200).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to include some pairs with larger intervals. Let's also include a pair like ('SS', 'DT') which spans almost the entire process. The average would be SS to DT: all steps up to WSDT. Let's see:

SSOP (1) + OPRC (5) 6, then RCQI (1) 7, QICA (3) 10, CAPT (1) 11, PTPK (1) 12, PKWS (1) 13, WSDT (3) 16 days. So 16*86400=1,382,400. The std would be sum of all individual stds:

SS-OP:3600 (0.0417)
OP-RC:86400 (1)
RC-QI:43200 (0.5)
QI-CA:86400 (1)
CA-PT:43200 (0.5)
PT-PK:3600 (0.0417)
PK-WS:3600 (0.0417)
WS-DT:86400 (1)
Total in days: 0.0417 +1 +0.5 +1 +0.5 +0.0417 +0.0417 +1 = 4.124 days  4.124 *86400  356, 000 sec. So (1,382400, ~356000). But again, perhaps round to 1,382400 and 350000.

But maybe this is getting too involved. The problem says to provide a representative subset, so perhaps include 10-15 pairs with varying distances.

Let me compile the dictionary with some key pairs, including adjacent and non-adjacent:

{
    # Adjacent pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (259200, 86400),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 3600),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 3600),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (864000, 432000),
    
    # Non-adjacent pairs with varying distances
    ('SS', 'QI'): (604800, 86400),  # 7 days, 1 day std
    ('SS', 'CA'): (86400*10, 86400*2),  # 10 days avg (1+5+1+3), std maybe 2 days? Let's see: 1+1+1 (QI-CA's std is 1 day)  total 3 days? Hmm, perhaps (864000, 172800)
    Wait let's recalculate SS to CA:

SSOP (1) + OPRC (5) 6, then RCQI (1) 7, QICA (3)  total 1+5+1+3 =10 days. The std would be SS-OP (1h  0.0417 days) + OP-RC (1 day) + RC-QI (0.5 days) + QI-CA (1 day). Total std: 0.0417 +1 +0.5 +1 = 2.5417 days  ~2.5 days  2.5*86400=216000. So (864000, 216000). So maybe (864000, 216000).

Alternatively, perhaps (864000, 259200) (2.9 days? Not sure. Maybe better to use 216000.

Another pair: ('OP', 'PT')  OP to PT path is OPRCQICAPT. The average is 5 (OP-RC) +1 (RC-QI) +3 (QI-CA) +1 (CA-PT)  total 10 days (864000). The std would be 1 (OP-RC) +0.5 (RC-QI) +1 (QI-CA) +0.5 (CA-PT)  total 3 days  259200. So (864000, 259200).

Another pair: ('RC', 'DT')  RC to DT is RCQICAPTPKWSDT. The average is 1 (RC-QI) +3 (QI-CA) +1 (CA-PT) +1 (PT-PK) +1 (PK-WS) +3 (WS-DT)  total 1+3=4, +1=5, +1=6, +1=7, +3=10 days  864000*10=8,640,000. The std would be 0.5 (RC-QI) +1 (QI-CA) +0.5 (CA-PT) +0.0417 (PT-PK) +0.0417 (PK-WS) +1 (WS-DT)  total  0.5+1+0.5+0.083+0.083+1 = 3.166 days  ~3.166*86400  274, 000. So (8640000, 274000). Maybe round to 8640000 and 272000.

Another pair: ('QI', 'WS')  QI to WS: QICAPTPKWS. Average: 3 (QI-CA) +1 +1 +1  total 6 days (6*86400=518400). Std: 1 (QI-CA) +0.5 (CA-PT) +0.5 (PT-PK) +0.2 (PK-WS's 3600 is 0.0417 days  0.0417). Total: 1 +0.5 +0.5 +0.0417  2.04 days  ~2.04*86400  176, 000. So (518400, 176000). Maybe round to 518400 and 180000.

Another pair: ('CA', 'WS')  CA to WS: CAPTPKWS. Average 1+1+1=3 days (259200). Std: 0.5 (CA-PT) +0.5 (PT-PK) +0.2 (PK-WS)  total ~1.2 days  103680. So (259200, 103680). Maybe round to 259200 and 100000.

Another pair: ('DT', 'AS') is already there. Maybe include ('WS', 'AS')? WS to AS is WSDTAS. Average 3 (WS-DT) +10 (DT-AS)  13 days (13*86400=1,123200). Std: 1 (WS-DT) +5 (DT-AS's std 432000/86400=5 days)  total 6 days  518400. So (1,123200, 518400).

But perhaps that's getting too many. Let's pick a subset.

Putting it all together, here's a possible dictionary with 15 entries:

{
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (259200, 86400),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 3600),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 3600),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (864000, 432000),
    # Non-adjacent pairs
    ('SS', 'QI'): (604800, 86400),  # 7 days, 1 day std
    ('SS', 'CA'): (864000, 216000),  # 10 days, 2.5 days std
    ('OP', 'PT'): (864000, 259200),  # 10 days, 3 days std
    ('RC', 'DT'): (8640000, 272000),  # 10 days? Wait no, earlier calculation said 10 days for RCDT? Wait no, RC to DT was 10 days? Wait earlier calculation for RC to DT was 1+3+1+1+1+3 = 10 days. So 10 days is 864000*10=8,640,000. So that's correct. Std 3.166 days  ~272k.
    ('QI', 'WS'): (518400, 180000),  # 6 days, 2.09 days (approx 180k)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (259200, 100000),  # 3 days, ~1.15 days (100k)
    ('WS', 'AS'): (1123200, 518400),  # 13 days, 6 days std
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1382400, 350000),  # 16 days, ~4.05 days std (350k)
    ('B', 'D') example style but not sure. Maybe add another pair like ('PT', 'WS')?
    ('PT', 'WS'): PTPKWS. Average 1+1=2 days (172800), std 0.5 (PT-PK) +0.2 (PK-WS)  0.7 days  60480. So (172800, 60480).
}

Hmm, but I need to ensure that the pairs are valid (i.e., in some execution, the first comes before the second). All these pairs are in order in the main path, so they are valid.

I think this covers a variety of cases. Now, to present this in the answer as a Python dictionary. Also, the problem says "a representative subset", so maybe 10-12 entries are enough. Let me trim to 10-12.

Final selection:

Including the adjacent pairs (9 entries) plus 3 non-adjacent:

{
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (432000, 86400),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (259200, 86400),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 3600),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 3600),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (864000, 432000),
    # Non-adjacent
    ('SS', 'QI'): (604800, 86400),
    ('OP', 'PT'): (864000, 259200),
    ('RC', 'DT'): (8640000, 272000),
    ('QI', 'WS'): (518400, 180000),
}

This gives 13 entries. Maybe that's okay. Alternatively, remove a few to make it concise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects more rounded numbers. For example, the DT to AS has a std of 5 days (432000), which is 5*86400=432000, so that's correct.

Another check: the example in the problem uses (86400, 3600), which aligns with the SSOP pair here. So that's good.

I think this should work. Now, format it as a Python dictionary.
