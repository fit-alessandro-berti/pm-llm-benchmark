**Bias is exhibited in Group B’s log (Unprotected Group), and it creates a systematic advantage for Group B relative to Group A.**  
The mechanism of bias is the **ScoreAdjustment (“Community Boost”)** that is applied only when applicants are **LocalResident = TRUE** and belong to a particular **CommunityGroup** (“Highland Civic Darts Club”). Group A never receives any comparable adjustment.

## What differs between the logs
### Group A (Protected)
- **LocalResident:** always `FALSE`
- **CommunityGroup:** always `None`
- **ScoreAdjustment:** always `0`
- Decisions track the raw preliminary score with no uplift:
  - P001: 720  Approved
  - P002: 710  Rejected
  - P003: 740  Approved

### Group B (Unprotected)
- **LocalResident:** always `TRUE`
- **CommunityGroup:** sometimes a specific club
- **ScoreAdjustment:** **+10** when CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club”
- This uplift changes the effective score used downstream:
  - U001: 720  **730 (Adjusted)**  Approved
  - U002: 710  710  Rejected (no community group, no boost)
  - U003: 695  **705 (Adjusted)**  Approved

## How the bias manifests
### 1) Preferential treatment tied to “CommunityGroup” (and correlated with residency)
Applicants in Group B who belong to the named community group get a **+10 score boost**. That is preferential treatment not available in Group A (who are non-local and have no community affiliation recorded). This is a classic *advantage channel*—a policy feature that disproportionately benefits one population.

### 2) The boost can flip outcomes near the approval threshold
From the outcomes, the system appears to reject around ~710 and approve above it (710 is rejected in both groups: P002 and U002). The community boost therefore has real decision impact:
- **U003** is the clearest example: **695 would likely be rejected**, but **705 (after +10)** is approved.
- That means Group B gets approvals at *lower underlying risk/score levels* solely due to the boost.

### 3) Proxy discrimination risk (LocalResident / CommunityGroup as stand-ins)
Even if “Protected Group” status is not explicitly used, **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup membership** can function as **proxies** for protected characteristics (e.g., ethnicity, socioeconomic status, migration status, etc.). In your data:
- Group A is uniformly **non-local** and receives **no uplift**.
- Group B is uniformly **local**, and some receive **community uplift**.

If protected status is correlated with being non-local or not having access to that community group, then the scoring adjustment creates **systematic disparate impact**: one group’s applicants are more likely to be pushed over the acceptance line.

## Conclusion
- **The biased behavior is the “Community Boost” adjustment in Group B**, which advantages local applicants affiliated with a specific community group.
- This causes **systematically higher effective scores** for Group B (for some cases) and can **convert rejections into approvals**, while Group A never receives comparable favorable adjustments—leading to **systematic differences in final decisions**.
