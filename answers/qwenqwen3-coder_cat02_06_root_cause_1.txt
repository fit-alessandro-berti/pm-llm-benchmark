Let's analyze the event log step-by-step to address your task.

## **Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Times**

We calculate the **total resolution time** for each case as the time difference between the **first event (Receive Ticket)** and the **last event (Close Ticket)**:

### **Case 101:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:00  
- End: 2024-03-01 10:15  
- **Total Time:** 2 hours 15 minutes

### **Case 102:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:05  
- End: 2024-03-02 09:15  
- **Total Time:** 25 hours 10 minutes

### **Case 103:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:10  
- End: 2024-03-01 09:30  
- **Total Time:** 1 hour 20 minutes

### **Case 104:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:20  
- End: 2024-03-02 08:30  
- **Total Time:** 24 hours 10 minutes

### **Case 105:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:25  
- End: 2024-03-03 09:30  
- **Total Time:** 49 hours 5 minutes

## **Step 2: Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

Comparing the total resolution times:
- **Case 101:** 2h 15m  
- **Case 102:** 25h 10m  
- **Case 103:** 1h 20m  
- **Case 104:** 24h 10m  
- **Case 105:** 49h 5m  

Cases **102 and 105** are significantly longer than the others. **Case 105** is the most extreme outlier.

## **Step 3: Analyze Root Causes of Delays**

### **A. Presence of Escalation**
- **Case 102:** Escalated to Level-2 Agent  Long gap (2.5 hours) between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent", and then a long wait (5 hours) before Level-2 starts investigating.
- **Case 105:** Escalated to Level-2 Agent  Very short time between investigation and escalation, but then a **19-hour delay** before Level-2 begins investigation.

**Conclusion:** Escalation is a **contributing factor**, especially when **follow-up actions (e.g., Level-2 investigation)** are **delayed**.

### **B. Waiting Time Between Activities**
Let's look for **long idle periods** between consecutive activities:

#### **Case 102:**
- Between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:00) and "Escalate to Level-2" (11:30): **2h 30m** (Level-1 idle).
- Between "Escalate to Level-2" (11:30) and "Investigate Issue" (14:00): **2h 30m** (Level-2 idle).
- Between "Resolve Ticket" (09:00) and "Close Ticket" (09:15): **15 minutes**.

#### **Case 104:**
- Between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:30) and "Investigate Issue" (13:00): **3h 30m** (Level-1 idle).

#### **Case 105:**
- Between "Investigate Issue" (09:10) and "Escalate to Level-2" (10:00): **50 minutes**.
- Between "Escalate to Level-2" (10:00) and "Investigate Issue" (14:00 next day): **~19h** (Level-2 idle).
- Between "Resolve Ticket" (09:00) and "Close Ticket" (09:30 next day): **24h** (closure delay).

**Conclusion:** There are **long idle periods** between steps, especially after escalation and before investigation or closure.

## **Step 4: Summary of Root Causes**

1. **Escalation without Prompt Follow-Up:**
   - In both **Case 102 and 105**, escalation occurred, but the subsequent investigation by Level-2 was significantly delayed.
   - This indicates **poor coordination or resource allocation** for escalated tickets.

2. **Idle Time Between Steps:**
   - Long delays between assignment and investigation (e.g., Case 104 had a 3.5-hour delay).
   - Long delays after resolution and before closure (e.g., Case 105 had a 24-hour delay post-resolution).

3. **Closure Delays:**
   - In **Case 105**, there was a full **24-hour delay** after resolution before closure, which suggests a **bottleneck or procedural delay** in finalizing tickets.

---

## **Step 5: Recommendations**

### **1. Improve Escalation Handling**
- Implement **SLAs** or **automated alerts** to ensure that escalated tickets are picked up by Level-2 agents within a defined time frame (e.g., 2 hours).
- Assign dedicated escalation queues and monitor them closely.

### **2. Reduce Idle Time Between Activities**
- Use **real-time dashboards** to track idle tickets and trigger reminders or escalations if no action occurs within expected time windows.
- Automate transitions where possible (e.g., auto-assign to Level-2 upon escalation).

### **3. Streamline Closure Process**
- Investigate why closures are delayed — is it a manual approval step? Can this be automated?
- Set a **maximum allowable time** between resolution and closure (e.g., 1 hour), and flag exceptions.

### **4. Analyze Workload Distribution**
- Examine whether certain agents or teams are overloaded, especially Level-2, which appears to be a bottleneck.
- Consider **load balancing** or **additional staffing** for Level-2 during peak times.

## **Conclusion**

Cases **102 and 105** are clear outliers in terms of resolution time. The **main contributors to delays** are:
- **Escalation without timely follow-up**
- **Significant idle time between process steps**
- **Delays in final closure**

By addressing these issues through better coordination, automation, and SLA enforcement, the organization can significantly reduce resolution times and improve customer satisfaction.
