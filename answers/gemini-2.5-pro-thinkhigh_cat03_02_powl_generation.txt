import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Define all individual activities as Transition objects
# These are the leaf nodes of our process model.

# Initial phase
sr = Transition(label="Service Request")
cs = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# Parallel preparation phase
da = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
aci = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

# Looped configuration phase
bnc = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
dr = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")

# Exclusive deployment choice phase
cd = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
md = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")

# Parallel finalization phase
qa = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
sa = Transition(label="Security Audit")

# Final approval
gla = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# 2. Define the composite POWL models (Loop and Choice)

# The configuration loop: execute BNC, then either exit or execute D&R and repeat.
# This corresponds to *(BNC, D&R).
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[bnc, dr])

# The deployment choice: an exclusive choice between containerized and monolithic deployment.
# This corresponds to X(CD, MD).
xor_deploy = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cd, md])

# 3. Construct the root POWL model as a StrictPartialOrder
# The root model contains all the top-level components of the process.
# These components are the individual activities that are not part of a loop/choice,
# and the composite operator nodes themselves.
root_nodes = [sr, cs, da, aci, loop_config, xor_deploy, qa, sa, gla]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=root_nodes)

# 4. Define the partial order by adding edges between the nodes
# An edge from A to B means A must be completed before B can start.
# Nodes without a path between them are concurrent.

# The process starts with Service Request, followed by Contract Setup.
root.order.add_edge(sr, cs)

# After Contract Setup, Datacenter Allocation and Access Control Initialization can start.
# They are prerequisites for the configuration loop.
root.order.add_edge(cs, da)
root.order.add_edge(cs, aci)
# Note: There is no edge between 'da' and 'aci', so they are concurrent.

# The configuration loop can only start after BOTH 'da' and 'aci' are complete.
root.order.add_edge(da, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(aci, loop_config)

# After the loop successfully completes, the deployment choice is made.
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, xor_deploy)

# After the chosen deployment is finished, QA and SA can start.
root.order.add_edge(xor_deploy, qa)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deploy, sa)
# Note: There is no edge between 'qa' and 'sa', so they are concurrent.

# The final Go-Live Approval can only happen after BOTH 'qa' and 'sa' are complete.
root.order.add_edge(qa, gla)
root.order.add_edge(sa, gla)


# --- Verification (Optional) ---
# Print the structure to verify its components.
