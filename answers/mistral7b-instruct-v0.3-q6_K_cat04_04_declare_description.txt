 The given declarative process model describes a financial approval and payment process involving an Employee, Pre-Approver, Administrator, Supervisor, Budget Owner, and Payment Handler. Here's an overview of the process based on the provided constraints:

1. Initialization: The process starts with the `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` event.

2. Existence: All events - `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`, `Payment Handled`, and `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` must occur at least once in a trace.

3. Responded Existence:
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then both 'Payment Handled' and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then both 'Request Payment' and 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must also occur.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then either 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled', or 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur.

4. Exactly 1: Each event can only occur exactly once in a trace.

5. Alternate response: Events must alternate without repetitions. For example, 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' is a valid sequence, while 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled' is not.

6. Precedence: Events are ordered in such a way that one event follows another. For example, 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must occur before 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', and 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must occur before 'Payment Handled'.

7. Chain precedence: Events are ordered in a direct chain, with each event immediately followed by the next one. For example, 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' is followed by 'Request Payment', and 'Request Payment' is followed by 'Payment Handled'.

8. Alternate precedence: Events must alternate without repetitions while maintaining the precedence relationship.

9. Response: If an event occurs, then another event must occur in the future of the trace. For example, if 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur.

10. Chain response: Events are ordered in a direct chain with each event following the previous one. If an event occurs, the next event must also occur. For example, 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' is followed by 'Request Payment', and 'Request Payment' is followed by 'Payment Handled'.

11. Non-Coexistence: If one event occurs, the other event should not occur. There are no such non-coexistence constraints provided in this model.

12. Non Succession and non Chain succession: There are no such constraints provided in this model.

13. Succession: Events are ordered in a way that one event is followed by the other, but not necessarily immediately. For example, 'Request Payment' is followed by 'Payment Handled', and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' is followed by 'Request Payment'.

14. Alternate succession: Events must alternate without repetitions while maintaining the succession relationship.

15. Chain succession: Events are ordered in a direct chain with each event following the previous one. If an event occurs, the next event must also occur. Similar to chain precedence and chain response, but for succession.

Overall, this process involves the employee submitting a declaration, which is then reviewed and approved by several levels of approval (Pre-Approver, Administrator, Supervisor, Budget Owner). Once approved, a payment request is generated, which is handled, leading to the final state. The events are interconnected through various response, precedence, succession, alternate response, alternate precedence, and alternate succession relationships.
