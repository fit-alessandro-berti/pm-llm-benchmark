To model the complex manufacturing and distribution process using POWL, we construct the following structure with sequential steps, loops, and partial ordering:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

# Define loops and choices
loop_AS_IQC = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])
loop_rt_tst = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[RT, TST])
xor_lb_skip = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, SilentTransition()])

# Construct the StrictPartialOrder
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        OR,
        MS,
        QS,
        AS,
        loop_AS_IQC,
        loop_rt_tst,
        PK,
        xor_lb_skip,
        DP,
        D
    ],
    order=[
        OR --> MS,
        MS --> QS,
        QS --> AS,
        AS --> loop_AS_IQC,
        loop_AS_IQC --> loop_rt_tst,
        loop_rt_tst --> PK,
        PK --> xor_lb_skip,
        xor_lb_skip --> DP,
        DP --> D
    ]
)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sequential Steps (OR  MS  QS  AS):**  
   Core activities occur in strict order: Order Received  Material Sourcing  Quality Screening  Assembly.

2. **Repeatable Assembly & Quality Check (Loop: * (IQC, AS)):**  
   After Assembly, IQC and AS form a loop (`loop_AS_IQC`). This allows multiple iterations of IQC followed by AS (e.g., Case 3’s repeated checks).

3. **Testing & Re-Testing Loop (Loop: * (RT, TST)):**  
   After the AS-IQC loop, testing (`TST`) is followed by re-testing (`RT`) if needed, repeating until exit (e.g., Cases 1 and 5).

4. **Packaging & Conditional Labeling (Choice: XOR):**  
   After testing, Packaging (`PK`) is followed by an XOR choice between Labeling (`LB`) and a silent skip. This skips LB in some cases (e.g., Case 2).

5. **Final Steps (DP & D):**  
   Distribution Planning (`DP`) and Dispatch (`D`) always follow after all prior steps, regardless of labeling.

**Partial Order Diagram:**  
```
OR  MS  QS  AS  (IQCAS)*  (RTTST)*  PK  [LB or ]  DP  D
```  
- **Loops** handle repetitions in quality checks testing.  
- **XOR** model optional labeling.  
- **StrictPartialOrder** ensures sequential dependencies (e.g., DP always after PK).
