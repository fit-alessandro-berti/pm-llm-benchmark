# **Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategy for Precision Parts Inc.**

Precision Parts Inc. operates in a high-mix, low-volume, job shop environment where the complexity of job routings, sequence-dependent setup times, and frequent disruptions make traditional scheduling approaches ineffective. The company faces significant challenges: high tardiness, excessive WIP, unpredictable lead times, and inefficient resource utilization. To address these issues, a **data-driven, process mining-informed scheduling strategy** is essential.

Below is a comprehensive response structured around the five key points outlined in your scenario.

---

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

### **Reconstructing the Actual Flow of Jobs and Task Execution**

Using **process mining tools** (e.g., ProM, Disco, or custom tools in Python with PM4Py), we can **reconstruct the actual workflow of jobs** by analyzing the event log. Each job is a **case**, and each task is an **activity** with a **resource** (machine or operator), **timestamp**, and **state** (e.g., queue, setup, running, done).

#### **Key Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:**

- **Process Discovery**: Use **Alpha Miner** or **Inductive Miner** to visualize the actual workflow of jobs, including routing, parallelism, and deviations from the planned route.
- **Conformance Checking**: Compare the actual workflow with the planned one to detect deviations and understand where and why delays occur.
- **Token-Playing and Simulation**: Replay the process on the log to simulate the flow and identify bottlenecks or delays.
- **Performance Analysis**: Use **cycle time**, **waiting time**, and **resource utilization** metrics to understand the efficiency of the shop floor.

### **Quantifying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

| KPI | How to Measure |
|-----|----------------|
| **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, Makespan** | Use the **start and end timestamps** of the job (from event log) to compute total time from release to completion. |
| **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times)** | Calculate the time between **Queue Entry** and **Task Start** for each task. |
| **Resource Utilization** | Compute **productive time** (task execution) vs. **idle time** (no task) and **setup time** (setup start to task start). |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times** | Use **Setup Start** and **Setup End** timestamps. For each machine, group setups by the **previous job** and **current job** to model setup time as a function of job sequence. |
| **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness** | Compare **actual task end time** with **planned end time** or **due date**. Tardiness = max(0, actual end time - due date). |
| **Impact of Disruptions** | Identify **breakdown events**, **priority changes**, and **urgent job insertions**. Compare KPIs before and after disruptions to quantify their impact. |

### **Example Insight:**

By analyzing the log, we can determine that **machine CUT-01** has a **high setup time** when transitioning from **JOB-6998** to **JOB-7001** (23.5 min vs. 20 min planned). This suggests that the **setup time is not constant** and is **sequence-dependent**, which is critical for scheduling.

---

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

### **Identified Pathologies:**

#### **A. Bottleneck Resources**
- **Analysis**: Use **resource utilization** and **waiting time** metrics to identify machines with **high utilization** and **long queues** (e.g., CUT-01, MILL-03).
- **Evidence**: Jobs queued for **> 2 hours** at a machine with **> 90% utilization**.
- **Impact**: Bottlenecks cause **delays in downstream tasks**, increasing **lead time** and **tardiness**.

#### **B. Poor Task Prioritization**
- **Analysis**: Compare **priority changes** (e.g., from "Medium" to "High") with **actual execution order**.
- **Evidence**: A **high-priority job** (JOB-7005) was released on **2025-04-21**, but **delayed** due to queueing at bottleneck machines.
- **Impact**: High-priority jobs are **not being prioritized** in execution, leading to **missed due dates**.

#### **C. Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Times**
- **Analysis**: Use **sequence-dependent setup time analysis** to detect jobs that are **not grouped by similarity**.
- **Evidence**: Jobs with **similar setup requirements** are scheduled **sequentially**, increasing total setup time.
- **Impact**: **Increased idle time** and **reduced throughput**.

#### **D. Starvation of Downstream Resources**
- **Analysis**: Use **resource contention** and **task execution order** to identify when **downstream machines** are **not fed on time**.
- **Evidence**: A **milling machine** (MILL-03) was **idle** because a **cutting job** was delayed due to a breakdown.
- **Impact**: **Starvation** of downstream machines **increases WIP** and **lead time**.

#### **E. Bullwhip Effect in WIP**
- **Analysis**: Use **WIP level** (number of jobs in the system) over time and **queue length** metrics.
- **Evidence**: WIP fluctuates **significantly** during **high-load periods**, indicating **unpredictable scheduling**.
- **Impact**: **Excess inventory** and **inconsistent lead times**.

### **Process Mining Techniques for Diagnosis:**

- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identify **resource utilization** and **waiting time** patterns.
- **Variant Analysis**: Compare **on-time vs. late jobs** to identify **pattern differences**.
- **Resource Contention Analysis**: Track **machine queue lengths** and **job arrival patterns**.
- **Causal Analysis**: Use **event log** to trace the **cause of delays** (e.g., breakdown, priority change).

---

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

### **Key Root Causes:**

#### **A. Static Dispatching Rules in Dynamic Environments**
- **Issue**: Rules like **First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)** or **Earliest Due Date (EDD)** are **not adaptive** to **real-time changes**.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Analyze **task execution order** vs. **priority**. If high-priority jobs are often **delayed**, it indicates **poor dispatching**.

#### **B. Lack of Real-Time Visibility**
- **Issue**: No **real-time view** of machine availability, queue lengths, or job progress.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Use **event log** to build **real-time dashboards** showing **machine status**, **queue lengths**, and **job progress**.

#### **C. Inaccurate Duration or Setup Time Estimations**
- **Issue**: **Planned task durations** are not reflective of **actual performance**.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Compare **planned vs. actual durations**. If **actual durations are consistently longer**, the **planning is flawed**.

#### **D. Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups**
- **Issue**: Setup times are **not optimized** for **job similarity**.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Use **setup time vs. job sequence** analysis to identify **optimal job groupings**.

#### **E. Poor Coordination Between Work Centers**
- **Issue**: No **synchronization** between machines, leading to **starvation or overloading**.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Use **task execution order** to detect **dependencies** and **bottlenecks**.

#### **F. Inadequate Response to Disruptions**
- **Issue**: No **dynamic rescheduling** for **breakdowns** or **urgent jobs**.
- **Process Mining Insight**: Analyze **time between disruption and rescheduling**. If it takes **> 2 hours**, it indicates **slow response**.

### **Differentiating Scheduling Logic vs. Capacity Limitations:**

- **Process mining can distinguish** between **scheduling errors** (e.g., wrong order of execution) and **capacity issues** (e.g., machine not available).
- **Example**: If a job is delayed because the **machine is already busy**, it’s a **capacity issue**. If it’s delayed because **another job was prioritized**, it’s a **scheduling issue**.

#### **Expected Impact:**
- **Reduces tardiness** by prioritizing jobs that are **close to due date** and **have high priority**.

- Use **anomaly detection** to **identify drifts** or **new inefficiencies**.

#### **Adaptive Scheduling Logic:**
- Use **machine learning models** to **predict optimal job sequences** based on **real-time data**.
- Use **feedback loops** to **refine scheduling rules** based on **actual performance**.

#### **Example:**
- If **tardiness increases** in a particular machine, the system could **re-optimize the sequence** of jobs on that machine using **historical data**.
