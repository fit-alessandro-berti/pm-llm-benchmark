Based on standard business practices for a **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** cycle, an ideal process should follow a logical sequence to ensure financial control, budget adherence, and inventory accuracy. The standard flow is generally:
1. Requisition $\rightarrow$ 2. Approval $\rightarrow$ 3. Purchase Order (PO) $\rightarrow$ 4. Goods Receipt $\rightarrow$ 5. Invoice Receipt $\rightarrow$ 6. Three-way Match $\rightarrow$ 7. Payment $\rightarrow$ 8. Close.

Here is an analysis of the provided event log:

### Case 1001: Standard Process (Baseline)
*   **Analysis:** This case follows the standard P2P lifecycle perfectly. The requisition was approved before the PO was issued, goods were received before the invoice was matched, and payment was released only after the "Three-way Match" (PO, Goods Receipt, and Invoice) was confirmed.
*   **Status:** **Normal.**

### Case 1002: Severe Control Breakdown
This case exhibits several critical anomalies that suggest a total bypass of internal controls:
*   **Anomaly A: Late Approval (Retroactive):** The Purchase Order was issued on Feb 1st, but the Requisition wasn't approved until Feb 3rd.
    *   *Why it’s problematic:* This is "after-the-fact" approval. It suggests the purchase was made without authorization, and the approval was likely a formality to "fix" the system record.
*   **Anomaly B: Payment before Matching/Receipt:** Payment was released on Feb 3rd (07:15), but the goods weren't received until Feb 4th, and the invoice wasn't matched until Feb 5th.
    *   *Why it’s problematic:* This is a high-risk financial anomaly. Paying a vendor before confirming that the goods have arrived or that the invoice matches the PO bypasses the **Three-way Match** control, leading to potential overpayment, fraud, or payment for defective/missing goods.

### Case 1003: Pre-payment Risk
*   **Anomaly: Payment before Invoice and Goods Receipt:** The payment was released on Feb 8th. However, the invoice was not received until Feb 9th, and the goods did not arrive until Feb 10th.
*   **Why it’s problematic:** Under standard accounting principles, a liability is only cleared once the invoice is verified against the receipt of goods. By paying on Feb 8th, the company has "pre-paid" without verifying the quantity or quality of the items received. This creates a cash-flow disadvantage and removes the company’s leverage if the shipment arrives damaged or incomplete.

### Case 1004: Maverick Buying / Procedural Bypass
*   **Anomaly: Goods Received before Purchase Order:** The goods were received at 09:00 on Feb 6th, but the formal Purchase Order was not issued until 09:15 that same day.
*   **Why it’s problematic:** This is a classic sign of **Maverick Buying**. It implies an employee ordered goods (perhaps via phone or informal email) without a system PO. The PO was only created *after* the truck arrived at the loading dock so that the system would allow the warehouse to log the receipt.
*   **Risk:** This bypasses budget checks and preferred-vendor negotiations. If the PO is created after the fact, the company may be forced to pay whatever price the vendor puts on the invoice because the goods are already on-site.
