Summary
- Compliant cases: 1 and 4.
- Violating cases: 2, 3, and 5.

Detailed explanations (rules quoted/paraphrased from the normative description and how each case breaks them)

Case 2 (Receive  Check  Package  Authorize payment  Ship  Close)
- Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
  - Normative rule: "Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging" and "Package items should only occur after authorization".
  - In Case 2 the order is Check  Package  Authorize, so packaging happened before authorization, which violates the required ordering (payment must be authorized before packaging).
- No other rule violations (Check occurs before authorization/packaging and Close is final), but the packaging-before-authorization breach is sufficient to mark the case nonconforming.

Case 3 (Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship  Close)
- Violation 1: Cancellation after authorization / authorizing when cancellation should have followed check.
  - Normative rule: if inventory is insufficient the process "should directly proceed to 'Cancel order'." Authorizing payment only makes sense when inventory sufficiency is known and the order will be fulfilled.
  - Interpretation: because a Cancel occurs after Check, the intent is the inventory was insufficient and the process should have gone Check  Cancel  Close. Authorizing payment prior to that cancellation contradicts the intended branching (authorizing for an order that should have been canceled).
- Violation 2: "Ship order" after a cancellation.
  - Normative rule: "Ship order should never occur after a cancellation" and fulfillment activities (packaging/shipping) are illogical after Cancel.
  - In Case 3 a Ship event occurs after Cancel, which directly violates this constraint.
- Both violations make the trace nonconforming.

Case 5 (Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Ship  Close)
- Violation: "Ship order" occurs without any prior "Package items".
  - Normative rule: "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping" and "Ship order should only occur after packaging".
  - In Case 5 packaging is missing entirely and shipping happens directly after authorization, so shipping before packaging (and absence of packaging) violates the required ordering.
- Close is final (OK), and Check happened before authorization (OK), but the missing packaging step / shipping-before-packaging is a nonconformance.

Notes on interpretation / ambiguity
- I interpreted any Cancel that follows Check as indicating the "insufficient inventory" branch, and therefore treated any prior Authorization or any subsequent shipping as violations (authorizing or shipping does not make sense if the order should have been canceled).
- The normative text allows some room for exceptional sequences, but the stated constraints (authorize only after check and before packaging; package only after authorization and before shipping; never ship after cancel; close as final) are strong enough to flag the above cases as nonconforming.

If you want, I can produce a version of the log annotated with the violated rule(s) at each event or propose minimal repairs (reorderings / missing activities) to make each violating trace conform.
