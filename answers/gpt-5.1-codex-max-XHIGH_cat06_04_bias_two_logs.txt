Looking across the two traces there are two things that stand out:

- In the GroupB runs you see an extra source of uplift that never appears in the GroupA runs. When `LocalResident=TRUE` and the applicant belongs to “Highland Civic Darts Club”, the scoring engine adds a +10 “Community Boost” to the preliminary score and that adjusted score is carried through to the decision. For example U001 moves from 720 to 730 and is approved, and U003 moves from 695 to 705 and is approved. In the GroupA cases the same fields are always `FALSE`/`None` and `ScoreAdjustment` is 0, so their final scores never benefit from that uplift.

- The effect of the boost is to change outcomes around the decision threshold. Both P002 and U002 had a preliminary score of 710 and no adjustment and were rejected. U003, however, had a lower underlying score (695) but was approved because the +10 adjustment pushed it over the line. A protected applicant with the same raw score would have remained below the cutoff.

So the bias manifests in the unprotected log: membership of a local community group and residence status trigger a favourable score adjustment that is unavailable to the protected group. If such attributes correlate with protected status, this sort of rule leads to systematic differences in final decisions, advantaging local communitygroup members and disadvantaging those who are not.
