Decomposition strategies can offer several benefits in large-scale process mining projects, but they also come with certain challenges. Here are some of the main advantages and difficulties associated with applying decomposition approaches in such projects:

Benefits:

1. Scalability: Large process event logs can be overwhelming and computationally expensive to analyze as a whole. Decomposition strategies allow breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, enabling the analysis to scale better and handle larger datasets.

2. Parallelization: By dividing the event log into separate parts, different components of the analysis can be executed in parallel, leveraging distributed computing resources and reducing overall processing time.

3. Complexity reduction: Process models derived from large event logs can be extremely complex and difficult to comprehend. Decomposition techniques can help simplify the analysis by generating smaller, more comprehensible sub-models, which can then be combined or compared.

4. Localized analysis: Decomposition allows focusing the analysis on specific parts of the process, enabling more detailed examination and identification of localized patterns, bottlenecks, or exceptional cases.

5. Modular approach: Decomposition facilitates a modular approach, where different teams or experts can work on separate components of the process simultaneously, potentially improving collaboration and efficiency.

Challenges:

1. Identifying appropriate decomposition criteria: Determining the optimal criteria for decomposing the event log and the process model is crucial but can be challenging, especially in complex processes with intricate dependencies and interactions.

2. Handling inter-component dependencies: Processes often involve intricate dependencies and interactions between different components or sub-processes. Decomposition strategies may overlook or oversimplify these dependencies, potentially leading to inaccurate or incomplete analysis.

3. Combining and reconciling sub-models: After decomposing the process and analyzing the sub-components, reconciling and integrating the individual sub-models into a coherent overall model can be a complex task, requiring careful consideration of potential inconsistencies or conflicts.

4. Ensuring consistency and completeness: Decomposition strategies may inadvertently introduce inconsistencies or overlook certain aspects of the process, leading to incomplete or inaccurate analysis results.

5. Interpretation and communication challenges: Decomposed process models may be more challenging to interpret and communicate, as stakeholders may struggle to understand the relationships and interactions between the individual sub-models.

To effectively apply decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between the benefits and challenges, and to employ appropriate techniques and methodologies to mitigate the potential risks and limitations. Collaboration between domain experts, process analysts, and data scientists can help identify suitable decomposition criteria and ensure a comprehensive and accurate analysis.
