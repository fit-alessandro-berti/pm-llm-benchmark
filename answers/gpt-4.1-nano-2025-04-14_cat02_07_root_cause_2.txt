Let's analyze the event log step-by-step to identify the cases with significant duration and then explore the potential root causes based on the attributes.

### Step 1: Calculate Duration for Each Case

To determine which cases are taking longer than expected, calculate the total time from **Submit Claim** to **Close Claim.**

| Case ID | Submission Time | Closure Time | Duration (Hours) | Notes |
|---------|------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **2001** | 2024-04-01 09:00 | 2024-04-01 10:30 | 1 hr 30 min | *Short duration* |
| **2002** | 2024-04-01 09:05 | 2024-04-02 11:00 | **26 hrs 55 min** | *Moderate duration* |
| **2003** | 2024-04-01 09:10 | 2024-04-03 09:30 | **48 hrs 20 min** | *Long duration* |
| **2004** | 2024-04-01 09:20 | 2024-04-01 10:45 | 1 hr 25 min | *Short duration* |
| **2005** | 2024-04-01 09:25 | 2024-04-04 14:30 | **75 hrs 5 min** | *Extended duration* |

### Step 2: Identify Cases with Performance Issues

From the durations, the **most prolonged cases** are:

- **Case 2003:** 48+ hours
- **Case 2005:** Over 3 days (~75 hours)
- **Case 2002:** Almost a day (~27 hours), slightly longer than ideal

These cases indicate potential performance issues, especially **Case 2003** and **Case 2005**.

### Step 3: Analyze Attributes to Find Root Causes

---

#### **Case 2003 (High Complexity):**

- **Attributes:**
  - **Resource:** Submit & Evaluate by **Jane / Mike** (Region A)
  - **Region:** A
  - **Complexity:** High
- **Key Observations:**
  - Multiple **Request Additional Documents** events occur over a prolonged period:
    - 2024-04-01 11:00
    - 2024-04-01 17:00
  - The **approval** happens only **next day after** the last document request, indicating delays in gathering documents and/or decision-making.

**Potential Root Causes:**
- High complexity claims inherently require more documentation and evaluation.
- **Resource limitations** or **overload** with complex cases.
- **Delays in collecting or reviewing supplementary documents**, possibly due to resource constraints or inefficient process steps.

---

#### **Case 2005 (High Complexity & Multiple Requests):**

- **Attributes:**
  - **Resource:** Lisa (Evaluate & Request Additional Documents)
  - **Region:** B
  - **Complexity:** High
- **Key Observations:**
  - Multiple **Request Additional Documents** activities across several days:
    - 2024-04-02 17:00
    - 2024-04-03 15:00
    - 2024-04-04 10:00
  - Longer wait times between activity events suggest bottlenecks in document collection or approval.

**Potential Root Causes:**
- High complexity combined with extensive documentation requests leads to prolonged processing.
- Resource **Lisa** is handling multiple complex cases but may be constrained in capacity or may lack streamlined procedures.
- **Scheduling delays or communication gaps** for gathering additional documentation.

---

#### **Case 2002 (Moderate Duration):**

- **Attributes:**
  - Resource: Lisa (Evaluate & Request Additional Documents)
  - Region: B
  - Complexity: Medium
- **Observations:**
  - Notable delay between evaluation (09:45) and document request (14:00), about 4.5 hours.
  - Slightly longer than the quickest cases but within reasonable bounds.

**Insights:**
- Moderate complexity with some process delays, possibly due to resource prioritization or workload.

---

### **Summary of Root Causes & Recommendations:**

| Root Cause | Explanation | Mitigation Strategies |
|--------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **High Claim Complexity** | More complex claims inherently need more time for evaluation, documentation, and approval. | Implement specialized teams for high-complexity claims, set flexible SLAs, or automate parts of document collection. |
| **Resource Constraints / Bottlenecks** | Resources like **Lisa** and **Mike** handle multiple requests and evaluations, possibly leading to delays. | Allocate dedicated resources or workload balancing for complex cases. Use automation for routine tasks. |
| **Inefficient Document Gathering Process** | Multiple document requests over several days indicate potential issues in communication, prioritization, or tracking. | Improve tracking systems, leverage digital portals for faster document submission, and establish stricter deadlines for responses. |
| **Regional Variations** | Both regions A and B handle complex cases, but Region B’s multiple document requests and longer durations suggest regional process differences. | Standardize procedures across regions, provide training, and monitor regional performance to ensure consistency. |

---

### **Conclusion:**

- The **cases with longer durations (2003 and 2005)** are associated with **High complexity**, multiple requests for additional documents, and resource handling.
- The key root causes revolve around **case complexity**, **resource allocation**, and **inefficient communication/process steps**.
- Addressing these issues through resource balancing, process automation, and clearer communication can significantly reduce case durations.
