Here's a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the given global supply chain process:
```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'RC'): (4.3, 1.1),  # From supplier selection to receiving components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (2.1, 0.6),  # From receiving components to quality inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (3.4, 1.2),  # From quality inspection to component assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (5.5, 2.0),  # From component assembly to product testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (1.8, 0.4),  # From product testing to packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (0.5, 0.1),  # From packaging to warehouse storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (10.2, 2.2),  # From warehouse storage to distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2.5, 0.5),  # From distribution to after-sales support
    ('SS', 'OP'): (2.5, 0.5),  # From supplier selection to order placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (3.7, 1.1),  # From order placement to receiving components
    ('QI', 'AS'): (7.3, 1.8),  # From quality inspection to after-sales support
    ('CA', 'PK'): (4.1, 1.0),  # From component assembly to packaging
    ('PT', 'AS'): (9.5, 2.0),  # From product testing to after-sales support
    ('PK', 'AS'): (5.8, 1.2),  # From packaging to after-sales support
    ('WS', 'AS'): (6.2, 1.5),  # From warehouse storage to after-sales support
    ('DT', 'PK'): (3.9, 0.9),  # From distribution to packaging
}
```
This temporal profile considers a representative subset of activity pairs, including those with multiple steps between them, as per your request. Each pair of activities is assigned an estimated average time and standard deviation. Note that these numerical values are placeholders and should be refined based on actual process data.
