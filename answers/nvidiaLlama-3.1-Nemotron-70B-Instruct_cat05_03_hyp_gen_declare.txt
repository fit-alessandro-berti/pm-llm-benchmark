**Task 1: Identified Anomalies**

1. **Conflict between Existence and Non-Coexistence Constraints:**
	* The existence constraint for activity "C" (Close Claim) and non-coexistence constraint between "E" (Evaluate Claim) and "C" are contradictory. The former enforces that every process must have a close event, while the latter suggests that if "E" happens, "C" cannot happen, implying not every process necessarily ends with "C" if "E" occurs.
2. **Precedence Constraint Over specification:**
	* The precedence constraint specifying that "C" must come after "R" (Receive Claim) is overly restrictive and doesn't account for other necessary steps like "A" (Assign Adjuster) and "E" (Evaluate Claim) that should precede "C" according to the ideal process flow.
3. **Responded Existence Constraint Incompleteness:**
	* The responded existence constraint for "E" only requires "A" to precede it, ignoring the initial "R" (Receive Claim) step which should logically precede both "A" and "E" in the process flow.

**Task 2: Hypotheses for Anomalies**

1. **Misalignment with Evolving Business Policies:**
	* Recent changes in claim handling procedures might not have been fully incorporated into the DECLARE model, leading to outdated constraints.
2. **Insufficient Stakeholder Input:**
	* The model might have been developed without comprehensive feedback from all relevant stakeholders (e.g., adjusters, customers, legal teams), resulting in a partial or biased representation of the process.
3. **Technical Limitations or Oversight:**
	* Constraints might have been inadvertently set or overlooked during the modeling process due to the complexity of the DECLARE framework or inexperience with process modeling.
4. ** Pressure for Efficiency Over Compliance:**
	* The desire to streamline the claim process might have led to the intentional omission of certain checks, potentially compromising the integrity of the claim evaluation and approval process.

**Task 3: Proposed Verification Approaches via SQL Queries**

### Anomaly 1: Existence vs. Non-Coexistence of "E" and "C"

* **Query 1.1:** Claims closed without evaluation
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, ce.activity, ce.timestamp
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C' AND c.claim_id NOT IN (
  SELECT claim_id
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'E'
)
```

* **Query 1.2:** Coexistence of "E" and "C"
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
```

### Anomaly 2: Precedence Constraint

* **Query 2:** Claims closed without preceding "A" and "E"
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, ce.activity, ce.timestamp
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
WHERE c.claim_id NOT IN (
  SELECT claim_id
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity IN ('A', 'E')
)
```

### Anomaly 3: Responded Existence Constraint

* **Query 3:** Evaluations without preceding "R"
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, ce.activity, ce.timestamp
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_r ON c.claim_id = ce_r.claim_id AND ce_r.activity = 'R' AND ce_r.timestamp < ce.timestamp
WHERE ce_r.event_id IS NULL
```
