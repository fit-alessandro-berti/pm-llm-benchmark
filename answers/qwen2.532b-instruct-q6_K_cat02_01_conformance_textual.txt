Based on the provided normative process description and the event log, I will analyze each case to determine whether it conforms to or deviates from the expected flow.

### Case Analysis

#### **Case 1:**
- Sequence:
  - Receive order
  - Check inventory
  - Authorize payment
  - Package items
  - Ship order
  - Close order
- Evaluation:
  - This sequence follows the described normative process perfectly for a scenario where inventory is sufficient.
  
**Verdict:** No deviations.

#### **Case 2:**
- Sequence:
  - Receive order
  - Check inventory
  - Package items
  - Authorize payment
  - Ship order
  - Close order
- Evaluation:
  - The sequence deviates in that "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
  - According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging.
  
**Verdict:** Deviation due to incorrect order of activities. "Package items" should not precede "Authorize payment."

#### **Case 3:**
- Sequence:
  - Receive order
  - Check inventory
  - Authorize payment
  - Cancel order
  - Ship order
  - Close order
- Evaluation:
  - The sequence has multiple issues:
    - "Cancel order" follows "Authorize payment," but "Authorize payment" should not occur if the inventory is insufficient.
    - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which contradicts the normative process that shipping should never happen after cancellation.
  
**Verdict:** Deviation due to logical errors. "Authorize payment" should not precede "Cancel order," and "Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation.

#### **Case 4:**
- Sequence:
  - Receive order
  - Check inventory
  - Cancel order
  - Close order
- Evaluation:
  - This sequence is correct for the scenario where there is insufficient inventory to fulfill the order.
  
**Verdict:** No deviations.

#### **Case 5:**
- Sequence:
  - Receive order
  - Check inventory
  - Authorize payment
  - Ship order
  - Close order
- Evaluation:
  - The sequence deviates because "Ship order" occurs without a "Package items" activity.
  - According to the normative process, "Package items" must occur before shipping.
  
**Verdict:** Deviation due to missing activity. "Package items" should precede "Ship order."

### Summary of Violations
- **Case 2:**
  - Package items occurs before Authorize payment.
- **Case 3:**
  - Authorize payment occurs despite insufficient inventory (detected by Check inventory).
  - Ship order happens after Cancel order.
- **Case 5:**
  - Missing Package items activity before shipping.

In conclusion, Cases 2, 3, and 5 exhibit deviations from the normative process. These violations can be attributed to misplaced activities or missing critical steps that contradict the defined workflow logic.
