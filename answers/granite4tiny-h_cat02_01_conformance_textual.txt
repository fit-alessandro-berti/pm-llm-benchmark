To address this task, we will systematically examine each case against the normative process description provided to determine where deviations from the intended flow occur.

### Case 1 Analysis:
- **Timeline**: 
  - 2023-10-05 09:00: Receive order
  - 2023-10-05 10:00: Check inventory
  - 2023-10-05 11:00: Authorize payment
  - 2023-10-05 12:00: Package items
  - 2023-10-05 13:00: Ship order
  - 2023-10-05 14:00: Close order

**Violations**: None. 
- The sequence matches the intended process perfectly: Receive -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order.

### Case 2 Analysis:
- **Timeline**: 
  - 2023-10-06 09:00: Receive order
  - 2023-10-06 09:30: Check inventory
  - 2023-10-06 10:00: Package items
  - 2023-10-06 10:30: Authorize payment
  - 2023-10-06 11:00: Ship order
  - 2023-10-06 11:30: Close order

**Violations**: 
- **Violation 1**: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
  - According to the normative process, authorization of payment should occur after checking inventory but before packaging. Packaging items prior to this step violates the intended sequence.

### Case 3 Analysis:
- **Timeline**: 
  - 2023-10-07 09:00: Receive order
  - 2023-10-07 09:20: Check inventory
  - 2023-10-07 09:40: Authorize payment
  - 2023-10-07 10:00: Cancel order
  - 2023-10-07 10:30: Ship order
  - 2023-10-07 11:00: Close order

**Violations**: 
- **Violation 1**: "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
  - The normative process clearly states that items should only be shipped after authorization and packaging. Canceling an order means the process must transition directly to cancellation followed by closing without proceeding to shipment.

### Case 4 Analysis:
- **Timeline**: 
  - 2023-10-08 09:00: Receive order
  - 2023-10-08 09:10: Check inventory
  - 2023-10-08 09:20: Cancel order
  - 2023-10-08 09:50: Close order

**Violations**: None. 
- This sequence adheres to the normative process perfectly: Receive -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order.

### Case 5 Analysis:
- **Timeline**: 
  - 2023-10-09 09:00: Receive order
  - 2023-10-09 10:00: Check inventory
  - 2023-10-09 10:30: Authorize payment
  - 2023-10-09 11:00: Ship order
  - 2023-10-09 11:30: Close order

**Violations**: None. 
- This sequence follows the intended flow correctly: Receive -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2** violates the process by packaging items before authorizing payment.
2. **Case 3** violates the process by shipping after cancellation, which is not permitted according to the normative description.

This analysis identifies specific areas where each case deviates from the intended process flow as outlined in the textual description provided for the normative process.
