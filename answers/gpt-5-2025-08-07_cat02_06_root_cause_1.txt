Here’s what the event log shows.

1) Cases with significantly longer total resolution times
- Fast (baseline, no escalation): 
  - Case 103: 1h20m
  - Case 101: 2h15m
- Slow (outliers):
  - Case 104: 24h10m
  - Case 102: 25h10m
  - Case 105: 49h05m

2) Likely root causes (with where the time is lost)
- Level-2 escalation delays (capacity/queue at L2)
  - Case 102: EscalateInvestigate waited 2h30m; then InvestigateResolve waited overnight (19h).
  - Case 105: EscalateInvestigate waited 28h; then InvestigateResolve waited overnight (19h).
  - Contribution: In 105, 47h of 49h is post-escalation waiting (28h L2 pickup + 19h overnight to resolve).
- Late escalation decisions at Level-1 (time spent before escalating)
  - Case 102: 2h30m from L1 assignment to escalate.
  - Case 105: 50m from L1 assignment to escalate.
  - This pushes work into the afternoon, making overnight carryover more likely.
- Delayed start of investigation after assignment (even without escalation)
  - Case 104: AssignInvestigate took 3h30m.
  - Indicates Level-1 queueing or workload bottlenecks.
- Systematic overnight carryover from Investigate to Resolve (working-hours constraint)
  - All long cases have a 19h gap between Investigate and Resolve (start investigating after midday, resolution deferred to next morning).
  - This single overnight delay accounts for ~75–80% of cycle time in 102 and 104.
- Not a factor: ResolveClose is consistently short (15–30m), so closure is not a bottleneck.

3) How these factors increase cycle time and recommendations
- How they drive delays
  - Queues and handoffs compound: L1 delay before escalation + L2 waiting + late-day start  hits the end-of-day cutoff, adding an automatic ~19h.
  - L2 capacity constraints amplify delays on escalated tickets (105 most extreme).
  - Even non-escalated tickets (104) suffer when AssignInvestigate is slow, again pushing work past the same-day window.

- Recommendations
  - Reduce L2 pickup time
    - Set an SLA for EscalateInvestigate (e.g., <60–120 minutes) and staff/roster L2 accordingly (peak coverage before midday; consider on-call/extended hours).
    - Create an “expedite/swarm” lane for escalations to bypass standard queues.
  - Escalate earlier and more accurately
    - Time-box L1 diagnosis (e.g., escalate if no path to resolution within 30–45 minutes).
    - Improve triage rules and decision support so specialized issues route directly to L2.
  - Start investigations sooner
    - SLA for AssignInvestigate (e.g., <60 minutes).
    - WIP limits and queue aging alerts to prevent long waits after assignment.
    - Auto-assignment to available agents to avoid idle-in-queue tickets.
  - Avoid overnight carryover
    - Target starting complex/escalated investigations in the morning; if started after a set cutoff, hand off to a later shift or use follow-the-sun coverage.
    - Establish an “end-of-day risk” alert: if Investigate hasn’t started by early afternoon for medium/high complexity, trigger action (reassign, escalate, or swarm).
  - Monitor the right KPIs
    - AssignInvestigate, AssignEscalate, EscalateInvestigate, InvestigateResolve, overnight-carryover rate, and % escalated.
    - Track median and 90th percentile cycle times separately for escalated vs non-escalated tickets.

Impact if implemented (based on current data)
- Eliminating the overnight gap alone would cut ~19h from cases 102, 104, 105.
- Ensuring L2 pickup within 1–2h could reduce case 105 by ~26h and case 102 by ~1–2h more, bringing them closer to same-day resolution.
