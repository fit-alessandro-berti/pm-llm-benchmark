# **Comprehensive Process Mining and Queue Mining Analysis for Outpatient Clinic Optimization**

---

## **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

### **Understanding "Waiting Time" in the Context of the Clinic**

In the context of a multi-specialty outpatient clinic, **waiting time** (or **queue time**) refers to the **time elapsed between the completion of one activity and the start of the next** for a given patient. This represents the time the patient is not actively engaged in a service activity but is waiting for the next step in their visit.

For example:
- **Patient V1001** completed **Registration** at 09:08:45 and started **Nurse Assessment** at 09:15:20.
- The **waiting time** between Registration and Nurse Assessment is:  
  **09:15:20 – 09:08:45 = 6 minutes and 35 seconds**

This concept can be generalized to all transitions between activities in the patient journey.

---

### **Key Metrics for Queue Characterization**

To characterize the queues, we will calculate the following metrics for each activity transition:

| Metric | Description | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Average Waiting Time** | Mean of waiting times between two activities | Overall sense of typical delay |
| **Median Waiting Time** | Middle value of waiting times | More robust to outliers |
| **Maximum Waiting Time** | Longest waiting time observed | Identifies worst-case delays |
| **90th Percentile Waiting Time** | Waiting time that 90% of patients experienced or less | Highlights long waits for most patients |
| **Queue Frequency** | Number of patients who waited for more than a threshold (e.g., 15 minutes) | Indicates prevalence of delay |
| **Number of Cases with Excessive Waits** | Count of cases where waiting time exceeds a clinically significant threshold (e.g., >30 minutes) | Prioritizes high-impact queues |

---

### **Identifying the Most Critical Queues**

To determine the most critical queues, we combine the above metrics with additional contextual factors:

#### **Criteria for Prioritization:**

1. **Longest Average/Median Waiting Times** – Queues with the highest average waiting times are likely to be the most impactful.
2. **High Queue Frequency** – Queues that occur often (e.g., >30% of patients) indicate a systemic issue.
3. **Impact on Patient Types** – Queues with disproportionately long waits for **urgent patients** or **new patients** may have higher clinical or reputational impact.
4. **Variability in Waiting Times** – High variability suggests unpredictability in service, which can lead to patient dissatisfaction.
5. **Strategic Bottlenecks** – Queues that occur **between high-impact activities** (e.g., waiting after registration before seeing a doctor) are more critical.

**Example:**
- If the **waiting time between Nurse Assessment and Doctor Consultation** has an average of 45 minutes, with 60% of patients waiting more than 30 minutes, and this transition is part of the **most common patient pathway**, this queue would be a top priority.

## **2. Root Cause Analysis**

Identifying queues is only the first step. To reduce waiting times, we must understand **why** the queues occur. Process mining tools can help uncover root causes by analyzing patterns in the event log.

### **Potential Root Causes and Mining Techniques to Identify Them**

| Root Cause | Description | Process Mining Technique |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Resource Bottlenecks** | Insufficient staff or rooms during peak hours | Resource allocation analysis, utilization analysis |
| **Activity Duration Variability** | Some nurses take significantly longer than others | Service time analysis, activity duration distribution |
| **Poor Handover Coordination** | Delays in transferring patients between staff or rooms | Process flow analysis, time between activity completions |
| **Appointment Scheduling Gaps** | No buffer time between appointments | Appointment scheduling pattern analysis, time between patient arrivals |
| **Patient Arrival Peaks** | High influx of patients during specific hours | Arrival rate analysis, time-based clustering |
| **Differences by Patient Type** | New patients take longer to process | Variant analysis, patient type-based process comparison |
| **Unnecessary Sequential Activities** | Activities could be parallelized but are not | Process discovery, Petri net or BPMN modeling |

---

### **Example: Doctor Consultation Delay**

- **Observation**: The queue between **Nurse Assessment** and **Doctor Consultation** is 35 minutes on average, with high variability.
- **Process Mining Insight**:
  - Doctor **Dr. Smith** is assigned to 60% of these cases but has the highest **utilization** and **variability** in service time.
  - **Doctor-to-patient ratio** is 1:30 during peak hours.
  - **Appointment scheduling** lacks buffer time between patients.

**Conclusion**: This queue is caused by **doctor overutilization**, **variable service times**, and **poor scheduling**.

---

## **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Nurse-Doctor Assignment Based on Urgency and Wait Times**

- **Target Queue**: Waiting between **Nurse Assessment** and **Doctor Consultation**
- **Root Cause**: Doctor overutilization, poor scheduling
- **Data Support**:
  - 70% of patients wait >30 minutes between Nurse and Doctor.
  - 5 doctors handle 90% of all consultations.
  - Urgent patients often wait longer than non-urgent patients.

**Proposed Action**:
- Use **predictive analytics** based on patient type and urgency to **assign patients to the most appropriate available doctor**.
- Implement **dynamic scheduling** that allows for **buffer time** and **load balancing**.

**Expected Impact**:
- **Reduction in average waiting time** between Nurse and Doctor by **25–35%**.
- **Improved equity** in waiting times for urgent vs. non-urgent patients.

---

### **Strategy 2: Parallelization of Diagnostic Tests**

- **Target Queue**: Waiting between **Doctor Consultation** and **Diagnostic Test** (e.g., ECG, X-Ray)
- **Root Cause**: Sequential processing of tests after doctor consultation
- **Data Support**:
  - 60% of patients undergo **ECG or blood tests** after consultation.
  - These tests are **often ready to be scheduled earlier** but are only initiated after the doctor completes the consult.

**Proposed Action**:
- **Move diagnostic test scheduling to post-nurse assessment**, if indicated, so patients can begin the test **while waiting for the doctor**.
- Use **clinical decision support tools** to flag test requirements early in the process.

**Expected Impact**:
- **Reduction in overall visit duration** by **15–20%**.
- **Reduction in waiting time before diagnostic test** by **40–50%**.

---

### **Strategy 3: Implementing a "Pre-Registration" or "Pre-Check-in" Kiosk System**

- **Target Queue**: Waiting for **Registration**
- **Root Cause**: Manual registration process during peak hours, long lines
- **Data Support**:
  - Average registration time is **6 minutes**, but with high variability.
  - During peak hours, 40% of patients wait >10 minutes to start registration.

**Proposed Action**:
- Introduce **self-service kiosks** for **pre-registration**.
- Allow patients to **check-in via mobile app** before arrival.

**Expected Impact**:
- **Reduction in registration wait time** by **60–70%**.
- **Reduction in perceived waiting time** due to pre-check-in.

## **4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

| Strategy | Potential Trade-offs / Constraints | Mitigation |
|----------|------------------------------------|------------|
| Dynamic Nurse-Doctor Assignment | May increase coordination overhead | Implement real-time dashboards and automated alerts |
| Parallelization of Diagnostic Tests | Requires clinical workflow redesign and staff training | Pilot in one department first; use change management |
| Pre-Registration Kiosks | Initial investment and patient adoption | Start with a small number of kiosks and collect feedback |
| Buffer time in scheduling | May reduce daily patient capacity | Offset with more efficient use of time during appointments |
| Staff Overload | Could negatively impact care quality | Monitor staff workload metrics and ensure adequate breaks |

**Balancing Objectives**:
- Use **multi-objective optimization models** to balance **waiting time reduction**, **staff workload**, and **cost**.
- Conduct **A/B testing** of new strategies in controlled environments before full rollout.
- Involve **clinical staff** in the design of new workflows to ensure **care quality** is maintained.

## **5. Measuring Success and Ongoing Process Monitoring**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

| KPI | Description | Target |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| **Average Patient Throughput Time** | Total time from registration to check-out | Reduce by 20% |
| **Average Waiting Time Between Key Activities** | E.g., Nurse to Doctor, Doctor to Diagnostic Test | Reduce by 25% |
| **Percentage of Patients with Waiting Time > 30 Minutes** | Proportion of patients with excessive waits | <10% |
| **Patient Satisfaction Score** | From post-visit surveys | Increase by 15% |
| **Resource Utilization Rate** | Doctor, nurse, room utilization | Optimize to 70–80% |
| **On-Time Start Rate for Appointments** | Percentage of appointments starting within 5 minutes of scheduled time | >90% |

---

### **Ongoing Process Monitoring**

- **Automate KPI tracking** using the event log data.
- **Deploy dashboards** in real-time for management and staff.
- **Conduct weekly bottleneck analysis** using process mining tools to identify emerging issues.
- **Use alert systems** for:
  - Waiting times exceeding thresholds
  - Resource overutilization
  - Sudden process deviations (e.g., a doctor's average service time increasing by 50%)

- **Retrain models quarterly** to adapt to changes in patient volume, staff availability, and new services.
