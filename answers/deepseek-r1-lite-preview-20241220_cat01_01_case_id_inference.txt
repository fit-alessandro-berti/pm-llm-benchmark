To group the events into separate cases based on the provided attributes, we can infer cases using the combination of `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, as they uniquely identify each patient. Additionally, we can confirm the grouping by examining the consistency of department, activities, and chronological order of timestamps.

### Case Groupings:

1. **Case 1: Patient Age 45, Gender M (Department: ER)**
   - **Event 1:** Register patient, department: ER
   - **Event 4:** Initial triage, department: ER
   - **Event 7:** X-ray imaging, department: Radiology
   - **Event 12:** Doctor consultation, department: ER
   - **Event 15:** Patient discharged, department: ER

2. **Case 2: Patient Age 62, Gender F (Department: ER)**
   - **Event 2:** Register patient, department: ER
   - **Event 5:** Initial triage, department: ER
   - **Event 8:** Lab test requested, department: ER
   - **Event 10:** Lab test completed, department: Laboratory
   - **Event 11:** Doctor consultation, department: ER
   - **Event 14:** Prescription created, department: ER
   - **Event 17:** Patient discharged, department: ER

3. **Case 3: Patient Age 28, Gender M (Department: Surgery)**
   - **Event 3:** Register patient, department: Surgery
   - **Event 6:** Doctor consultation, department: Surgery
   - **Event 9:** Surgery preparation, department: Surgery
   - **Event 13:** Surgery performed, department: Surgery
   - **Event 16:** Recovery room, department: Surgery
   - **Event 18:** Patient discharged, department: Surgery

### Summary:
- **Case 1 (45 M, ER):** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- **Case 2 (62 F, ER):** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- **Case 3 (28 M, Surgery):** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

This grouping ensures that each patient's journey through the hospital is correctly followed, based on their unique `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and the sequence of activities they undergo in their respective departments.
