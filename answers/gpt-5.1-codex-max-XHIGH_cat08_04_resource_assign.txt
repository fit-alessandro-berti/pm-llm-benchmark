### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

**Use the event log to build a resourcecentric view of the process**

- **Workload and utilization per agent/tier:**
  - Compute number of cases handled, busy time (sum of `Work Start`–`Work End`) and idle time per agent and per tier.
  - Derive utilization as busy time / (scheduled availability) to see who is overloaded or underutilized.
  - Break down by priority and category to see if certain agents/tier are taking disproportionate shares of P2/P3 or certain categories.

- **Performance per activity per agent/tier:**
  - Calculate processing times for activities (e.g., average L1 handling time from `Work L1 Start` to `Work L1 End`) per agent and per tier.
  - Measure waiting times between `Assign` and `Work Start` to see queueing delays by tier.

- **Effectiveness metrics:**
  - Firstcontact resolution rate at L1: cases that start at L1 and are completed without an `Escalate` event.
  - Escalation rate: percentage of cases an agent escalates vs resolves.
  - Reassignment frequency: number of `Reassign` events per case; agents who frequently reassign.

- **Skill and ticket type distribution:**
  - For each agent, tally tickets by `Ticket Category` and `Required Skill` to see what they actually handle versus their documented skills.
  - Compute an “overqualification” ratio: proportion of cases where the agent’s skills exceed the required skill (e.g., L2 CRM specialist working on BasicTroubleshoot).

**Apply process mining techniques to uncover actual patterns**

- **Resource interaction/social network analysis:** Build a handoverofwork network from `Assign/Escalate/Reassign` events to visualize L1L2/L3 handovers, loops back to L1, and identify brokers (agents frequently handing off) and hubs (agents receiving many handovers). Compare to the intended tiered flow; e.g., if you see frequent L2L2 reassignments, the current model may be too coarse.

- **Role discovery:** Cluster agents based on their behavior in the log (activities performed, ticket types handled, skills used) to validate or refine roles beyond formal tier labels. You might discover some “L1”s effectively acting as L2 for certain apps.

- **Conformance checking:** Compare the discovered process model to the designed model with roundrobin tier assignment. Highlight deviations like unexpected direct L1L3 escalations or multiple intratier reassignments.

- **Skill utilization analysis:** Cross the `Required Skill` field with `Agent Skills` for each assignment to compute match/mismatch. Identify skills that are rarely used and specialists frequently assigned to nonmatching, lowcomplexity tasks.

### 2. Identifying ResourceRelated Bottlenecks and Issues

Using the above analyses, you can pinpoint issues such as:

- **Skill bottlenecks:** Long queues or extended waiting times for cases requiring certain skills (e.g., NetworkingFirewall). Quantify average wait to `Work Start` for those skills versus others. If only one or two agents have a skill, their utilization and backlog will reflect this.

- **Delays from reassignments/escalations:**
  - Compute the average time added per `Reassign`/`Escalate` step (timestamp difference before and after reassignment).
  - Quantify the impact on SLAs: e.g., “P3 tickets with 2 reassignments breach SLA 35% of the time vs 10% with no reassignments.”

- **Incorrect initial assignments:**
  - Measure proportion of cases reassigned within X minutes of initial assignment, indicating misrouting.
  - Analyze categories/dispatchers with high misassignment rates.

- **Underperforming/overloaded agents/teams:**
  - Agents with consistently longer handling times than peers for the same activity/skill.
  - Agents/tier with utilization >90% and growing queues; conversely, agents with low utilization.

- **Correlation with SLA breaches:**
  - Link SLA outcome to assignment patterns: number of escalations, skill mismatches, specific agents. For example, “50% of breached P2s had an L1 assignment to an agent without the required skill.”

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Potential root causes include:

- **Assignment rules ignoring skills/workload:** Roundrobin within tiers can assign tickets to agents lacking the required skill or already overloaded, leading to reassignments and delays.

- **Outdated/incorrect skill profiles:** If `Agent Skills` are incomplete, dispatchers misroute tickets. Crosschecking required skills against successful resolutions can reveal gaps.

- **Poor initial categorization:** Misclassified tickets (wrong `Ticket Category`/`Required Skill`) lead to wrong routing. Decision mining on escalation decisions can show which categories are often corrected later.

- **Lack of workload visibility:** Without realtime queue lengths, dispatchers cannot balance load, overloading certain agents.

- **Insufficient L1 training:** Low firstcall resolution and high L1 escalation rates for certain categories suggest training gaps.

**Use variant and decision mining to evidence these causes:**

- **Variant analysis:** Compare a “happy path” variant (L1 assign  work  resolve) versus a problematic variant (L1 assign  escalate  L2 reassigns  …). Identify common attributes in the problematic variant (e.g., specific categories, dispatchers, times of day).

- **Decision mining:** Mine decision rules leading to escalations/reassignments: e.g., a decision tree using ticket attributes, initial agent, and outcome. This can highlight that tickets with vague descriptions or marked “SoftwareApp” are escalated 70% of the time when assigned to generic L1, suggesting categorization or routing issues.

### 4. Developing DataDriven Resource Assignment Strategies

Here are three concrete strategies, grounded in the analysis:

**A. Skillbased, proficiencyweighted routing**

- **Issue addressed:** Misassignments and overuse of specialists on basic tasks.
- **Approach:** Route new tickets to agents whose documented skills match the `Required Skill`/category, weighted by proficiency level and historical success (from the log). If multiple matches, select the least loaded.
- **Data needed:** Uptodate agent skill matrix with proficiency; historical resolution success by skill; realtime agent availability.
- **Benefits:** Fewer reassignments, higher firsttime resolution, better utilization of specialists on appropriate tasks.

**B. Workloadaware assignment and dynamic load balancing**

- **Issue addressed:** Uneven workload and waiting times leading to SLA breaches.
- **Approach:** Implement an assignment algorithm that considers current queues and agent utilization. Use mined service times to estimate expected effort by priority/category. Dispatchers assign to the qualified agent with lowest projected load. Introduce queue threshold alerts and the ability to temporarily reallocate agents between tiers for overflow.
- **Data needed:** Realtime queue lengths per tier/skill; estimated handling times by ticket type; agent availability schedules.
- **Benefits:** Balanced workload, reduced waiting time to `Work Start`, fewer SLA breaches due to queueing.

**C. Predictive triage and escalation refinement**

- **Issue addressed:** Late recognition of required skills and unnecessary escalations.
- **Approach:** Use historical logs to train a classifier on ticket metadata (category, description keywords, channel) to predict required skills and likelihood of L1 resolution. Use this to:
  - Improve initial categorization and required skill tagging.
  - Autoroute tickets predicted to need L2/L3 directly, bypassing L1 when appropriate.
  - Identify categories where L1 could resolve with additional training and adjust escalation criteria.
- **Data needed:** Rich ticket metadata (descriptions), outcomes (escalated/resolved at L1), required skills; text mining capabilities.
- **Benefits:** Better initial routing, fewer handovers, targeted training for L1 to boost firstcall resolution.

Additional options you can layer on:

- **Skillbased pooling and crosstraining:** Identify underutilized skills and train L1 agents accordingly to absorb more load for specific categories.
- **Timeofday staffing adjustments:** Use temporal analysis to dynamically schedule more agents with needed skills during peak times observed in the log.

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

**Simulate before you change:**

- Build a simulation model from the discovered process (activities, frequencies) enriched with resource pools and performance parameters (service times by agent/tier/skill, arrival rates by hour, priorities).
- Define scenarios implementing the new assignment rules (skillbased routing, workloadaware dispatch) and run “whatif” simulations to compare KPIs such as average resolution time per priority, SLA breach rates, queue lengths, and utilization distributions.
- Use sensitivity analysis to see how variations in staffing or skill distribution affect outcomes, helping justify investments (e.g., adding a firewall specialist).

**Monitor after implementation with process mining dashboards:**

Set up continuous monitoring of resourcerelated KPIs and process views, such as:

- SLA compliance rates by priority/category and by assignment variant.
- Cycle time and waiting time distributions, with performance overlays by tier and required skill.
- Firstcall resolution rate at L1, escalation and reassignment rates over time.
- Resource utilization and workload balance: busy time vs availability per agent; queue lengths per skill/tier.
- Skill mismatch rate: percentage of assignments where agent skills don’t match required skills.
- Social network of handovers to detect emerging bottlenecks (spikes in L1L2L2 loops).
- Impact of new rules: compare pre and postimplementation variants and performance.

Regularly review these dashboards to finetune assignment parameters, update skill profiles, and adjust training. Conformance checking can ensure the actual routing aligns with the designed skillbased/workloadaware logic and flag deviations early.
