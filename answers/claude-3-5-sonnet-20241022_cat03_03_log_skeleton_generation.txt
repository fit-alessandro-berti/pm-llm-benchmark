I'll create a Log Skeleton dictionary that captures the logical constraints for this order fulfillment process. Here's the solution with explanations for each constraint:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Every order must be checked for availability
        ('PO', 'GSL'),  # Every packed order needs a shipping label
        ('PI', 'QC')    # Every picked item must go through quality check
    },
    
    'always_before': {
        ('PI', 'CA'),    # Check availability before picking
        ('PO', 'QC'),    # Quality check before packing
        ('D', 'GSL'),    # Generate shipping label before dispatch
        ('IC', 'D'),     # Dispatch before invoicing
        ('RP', 'IC')     # Invoice before recording payment
    },
    
    'always_after': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),    # Check availability after receiving order
        ('RI', 'CA'),    # Reserve items after checking availability
        ('PI', 'RI'),    # Pick items after reserving them
        ('D', 'PO'),     # Dispatch after packing
        ('RP', 'IC')     # Record payment after invoicing
    },
    
    'never_together': set(),  # All activities can potentially occur together
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},    # Exactly one receive order
        'CA': {1},    # Exactly one availability check
        'RI': {1},    # Exactly one reservation
        'PI': {1},    # Exactly one picking
        'QC': {1},    # Exactly one quality check
        'PO': {1},    # Exactly one packing
        'GSL': {1},   # Exactly one shipping label
        'D': {1},     # Exactly one dispatch
        'IC': {1},    # Exactly one invoice
        'RP': {0,1}   # Payment might not be recorded yet
    },
    
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # Availability check follows order receipt
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # Reservation follows availability check
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # Picking follows reservation
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # Quality check follows picking
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # Packing follows quality check
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # Label generation follows packing
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # Dispatch follows label generation
        ('D', 'IC')      # Invoice follows dispatch
    }
}
```

Explanation of the constraints:

1. **Equivalence**: Activities that must occur the same number of times. For example, every order that's packed must have a shipping label.

2. **Always Before**: Activities that must precede others. For example, availability must be checked before picking items.

3. **Always After**: Activities that must follow others. For example, dispatch must happen after packing.

4. **Never Together**: In this scenario, all activities can potentially occur together in a case, so this set is empty.

5. **Activity Occurrences**: Most activities occur exactly once per case (frequency {1}), except for Record Payment which might not have occurred yet (frequency {0,1}).

6. **Directly-Follows**: Represents the immediate succession of activities. For example, quality check immediately follows picking.

This Log Skeleton ensures that:
- The process follows a logical order
- All mandatory steps are included
- Activities occur in the correct sequence
- Each activity (except payment recording) happens exactly once
- The process maintains proper flow from order receipt to payment recording
