# Business Process Workflow Diagram (Petri Net)

## Overview
This visualization shows a **workflow net** (a type of Petri net) modeling a request handling process, likely for claims or compensation.

## Process Activities (Nodes)

| Node | Activity |
|------|----------|
| **a** | Register request (start) |
| **b** | Examine thoroughly |
| **c** | Examine casually |
| **d** | Check ticket |
| **e** | Decide |
| **f** | Reinitiate request |
| **g** | Pay compensation |
| **h** | Reject request |
| **z** | End |

## Process Flow

1. **Start**: The process begins at "register request" (a)
2. **Parallel Split**: After registration, three activities can occur in parallel:
   - Examine thoroughly (b)
   - Examine casually (c)
   - Check ticket (d)
3. **Synchronization**: All paths converge at "decide" (e)
4. **Decision Point**: From decide, the process either:
   - Pays compensation (g)  End
   - Rejects request (h)  End
   - Loops back via "reinitiate request" (f)

## Legend (Bottom Right)
The gray box shows **gateway patterns**:
- **XOR**: Exclusive choice (one path)
- **AND**: Parallel execution (all paths)
- **OR**: Inclusive choice (one or more paths)

Both **split** (diverging) and **join** (converging) variants are shown.
