Here’s a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the global supply chain process, including estimated average times and standard deviations for key activity pairs (both directly connected and eventually following each other). The values are realistic estimates based on typical supply chain dynamics (e.g., procurement lead times, manufacturing cycles, testing durations, etc.):

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs (sequential steps)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 3600),      # Supplier selection to order placement: ~2 hours (avg), ±1 hour
    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 86400),   # Order placement to receipt: ~2 days (avg), ±1 day (supplier lead time)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 1800),      # Receipt to inspection: ~1 hour (avg), ±30 mins
    ('QI', 'CA'): (10800, 5400),     # Inspection to assembly: ~3 hours (avg), ±1.5 hours
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 10800),    # Assembly to testing: ~6 hours (avg), ±3 hours
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 3600),      # Testing to packaging: ~2 hours (avg), ±1 hour
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800),      # Packaging to storage: ~1 hour (avg), ±30 mins
    ('WS', 'DT'): (43200, 21600),    # Storage to distribution: ~12 hours (avg), ±6 hours (shipping schedule)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 43200),    # Distribution to after-sales: ~1 day (avg), ±12 hours (support response time)

    # Eventually following pairs (non-sequential but common in traces)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (180000, 90000),   # Selection to receipt: ~5 days (avg), ±2.5 days (supplier variability)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (176400, 86400),   # Order to inspection: ~2 days (avg), ±1 day (lead time + inspection)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (14400, 7200),     # Receipt to assembly: ~4 hours (avg), ±2 hours (inspection + prep)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (25200, 12600),    # Inspection to packaging: ~7 hours (avg), ±3.5 hours (assembly + testing)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (28800, 14400),    # Assembly to storage: ~8 hours (avg), ±4 hours (testing + packaging)
    ('PT', 'DT'): (50400, 25200),    # Testing to distribution: ~14 hours (avg), ±7 hours (packaging + shipping)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (90000, 43200),    # Packaging to after-sales: ~25 hours (avg), ±12 hours (distribution + support)

    # Longer-range pairs (e.g., procurement to distribution)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (432000, 216000),  # Selection to distribution: ~5 days (avg), ±6 days (end-to-end variability)
    ('OP', 'AS'): (360000, 180000),  # Order to after-sales: ~4 days (avg), ±5 days (full cycle)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (216000, 108000),  # Receipt to distribution: ~2.5 days (avg), ±3 days
}
```

### Key Notes:
1. **Units**: All times are in **seconds** (e.g., `86400` = 1 day).
2. **Variability**: Standard deviations reflect real-world uncertainty (e.g., supplier delays, testing rework, shipping bottlenecks).
3. **Complexity**: Includes both **directly sequential** pairs (e.g., `('OP', 'RC')`) and **eventually following** pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'DT')`).
4. **Realism**: Estimates align with high-tech supply chains (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing), where:
   - Procurement (`SS``RC`) is highly variable.
   - Assembly/testing (`CA``PT`) has moderate variability.
   - Distribution (`WS``DT`) depends on logistics (e.g., air vs. sea freight).

### Example Use Case:
To detect deviations with `ZETA = 2`:
```python
avg, std = temporal_profile[('OP', 'RC')]  # (172800, 86400)
lower_bound = avg - 2 * std  # 172800 - 172800 = 0
upper_bound = avg + 2 * std  # 172800 + 172800 = 345600
```
A trace where `OP``RC` takes **400,000 seconds** (111 hours) would trigger a deviation (exceeds `upper_bound`).
