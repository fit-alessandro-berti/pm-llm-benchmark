### **Merged Event Log**

Below is the integrated event log combining **Log A** and **Log B**. The merging process involved aligning events based on `order_id` and timestamp proximity, resolving naming discrepancies, and enriching attributes from both logs.

| **Timestamp (Primary)**         | **Event Type**          | **Order ID** | **User ID** | **Resource ID** | **Notes**                     | **Origin** | **Reasoning**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### **Detailed Reasoning & Merging Decisions**

1. **Event Alignment Based on `order_id` and Timestamp:**
   - **Primary Key for Matching:** `order_id` was used as the primary key to align events across both logs.
   - **Timestamp Tolerance:** A tolerance of Â±2 seconds was applied to account for slight discrepancies in timestamp granularity and system offsets.
   - **Event Naming Variations:** Event names were compared for semantic similarity. For example, `Order Received` and `OrderReceived` were deemed equivalent.

2. **Merging Attributes:**
   - **Enriched Attributes:** When events were matched, attributes from both logs were combined. For instance, `user_id` and `resource_id` from **Log B** were added to the merged record.
   - **Notes Field:** The `notes` field from **Log B** was included to provide additional context.

3. **Handling Non-Matching Events:**
   - **Log B-Specific Events:** Events like `Quality Check` in **Log B** had no corresponding event in **Log A**. These were included as separate records, indicating their origin.
   - **Log A-Specific Events:** Similarly, `Item Delivered` in **Log A** was not present in **Log B** and was included as-is.

4. **Timestamp Selection for Merged Events:**
   - **Priority to Log B Timestamps:** In cases where timestamps differed, **Log B** timestamps were generally preferred because they likely reflect the actual event time more accurately, given that **Log A** timestamps may represent the time of receipt.
   - **Exceptions:** In scenarios where **Log A** provided a more precise or relevant timestamp, it was used instead.

5. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - **Event Naming Conflicts:** Semantic alignment was prioritized over exact naming. For example, `PaymentCheck` in **Log B** was interpreted as equivalent to `Payment Processed` in **Log A**.
   - **Attribute Conflicts:** In cases of attribute conflicts, the attribute from **Log B** was generally chosen due to its richer metadata.

6. **Final Chronological Ordering:**
   - The merged log is presented in chronological order based on the selected primary timestamp.

### **Summary of Merging Decisions**

- **Matched Events:**  
  - `Order Received` / `OrderReceived`  
  - `Order Validated` / `OrderValidation`  
  - `Payment Processed` / `PaymentCheck`  
  - `Item Shipped` / `Shipping`  

- **Non-Matching Events:**  
  - `Quality Check` (only in **Log B**)  
  - `Item Delivered` (only in **Log A**)  

- **Enriched Attributes:**  
  - Attributes from both logs were combined, enhancing the depth of the merged event log.

This merging approach ensures a comprehensive and coherent integrated event log that leverages the strengths of both systems while resolving discrepancies and conflicts effectively.
