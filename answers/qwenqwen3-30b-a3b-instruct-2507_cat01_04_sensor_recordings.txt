### **Process Mining Analysis: Inferred Manufacturing Activities from Sensor Data**

We are given a time-series event log from a single machine (Machine ID: M1) with six sensor readings over time. Our goal is to **identify distinct phases** in the process based on patterns in the sensor data and **assign meaningful activity labels** such as "Cutting Metal," "Assembling Parts," "Welding," "Quality Inspection," or "Packaging."

## **Step 1: Visualize and Analyze Patterns**

Let’s examine how each sensor evolves over time (Event #1 to #15):

| Event | Temp | Press | Vib | Flow | Tool Pos | Energy |
|-------|------|-------|-----|------|----------|--------|
| 1–3   | 2021 | 1     | 0   | 0    | 0        | 0.4–0.5 |
| 4     | 50    | 1     | 30  | 5    | 5        | 2.0    |
| 5     | 55    | 1.5   | 35  | 5    | 7        | 2.5    |
| 6     | 58    | 1.5   | 38  | 5    | 10       | 3.0    |
| 7–8   | 40    | 2     | 10  | 2    | 15       | 2.0    |
| 9     | 80    | 2     | 50  | 0    | 15       | 5.0    |
| 10    | 30    | 1     | 1   | 0    | 15       | 1.0    |
| 11–12 | 25    | 1     | 5   | 1    | 20       | 1.5–1.6 |
| 13–15 | 20–21 | 1     | 0   | 0    | 0        | 0.4–0.5 |

## **Step 2: Identify Distinct Phases Based on Sensor Patterns**

We identify **four distinct phases** based on abrupt changes and sustained patterns.

---

### **Phase 1: Idle / Preparation (Events 1–3 and 13–15)**  
**Events:** #1, #2, #3  #13, #14, #15  
**Characteristics:**
- Temperature: ~20–21°C (ambient)
- Pressure: 1 bar (low)
- Vibration: 0 Hz (no motion)
- Material Flow: 0 units/s
- Tool Position: 0 mm (retracted)
- Energy: Low (~0.4–0.5 kWh)

**Pattern:** Stable, low values across all sensors. No activity. The system is idle or preparing.

 **Label: Idle / Machine Preparation**

> **Rationale:** All sensors remain at baseline levels. No movement, flow, or energy spike. This is a resting state, likely before or after a process cycle.

---

### **Phase 2: Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)**  
**Events:** #4, #5, #6  
**Characteristics:**
- Temperature: Rises sharply from 21°C  58°C
- Pressure: Increases from 1  1.5 bar
- Vibration: Spikes from 0  38 Hz (high)
- Material Flow: Stable at 5 units/s
- Tool Position: Increases from 5  10 mm (moving into workpiece)
- Energy: Rises from 2.0  3.0 kWh

**Pattern:** Sudden increase in temperature, vibration, and energy. Tool is moving (increasing position), material is flowing, and pressure rises slightly.

 **Label: Cutting Metal**

> **Rationale:** High vibration and temperature indicate friction from cutting. Steady material flow and increasing tool position suggest a tool is advancing into a workpiece. Energy consumption increases significantly—typical of mechanical cutting (e.g., sawing, milling). This matches the signature of a **cutting operation**.

---

### **Phase 3: Welding (Events 7–9)**  
**Events:** #7, #8, #9  
**Characteristics:**
- Temperature: Spikes to 80°C (very high)
- Pressure: Stable at 2 bar
- Vibration: High (50 Hz), but lower than cutting phase
- Material Flow: Drops to 0 (no material input)
- Tool Position: Stabilized at 15 mm (tool is stationary)
- Energy: Peaks at 5.0 kWh (highest in log)

**Pattern:** Temperature surges to 80°C, energy peaks, tool is stationary, vibration is high but not increasing. Flow stops.

 **Label: Welding**

> **Rationale:** The **high temperature** and **peak energy** with **no material flow** and **fixed tool position** strongly suggest a **welding process**, where intense heat is applied locally to join materials. The vibration may come from the welding arc or mechanical stress. The drop in flow indicates no material is being fed—consistent with welding.

---

### **Phase 4: Assembly / Post-Weld Inspection (Events 10–12)**  
**Events:** #10, #11, #12  
**Characteristics:**
- Temperature: Drops to 25–30°C (cooling)
- Pressure: Returns to 1 bar
- Vibration: Low (1–5 Hz)
- Material Flow: Starts again at 1 unit/s
- Tool Position: Moves to 20 mm
- Energy: Moderate (~1.5–1.6 kWh)

**Pattern:** After the high-energy weld, the system cools down, vibration decreases, and material flow resumes. Tool position increases to 20 mm, suggesting a new operation.

 **Label: Assembling Parts / Post-Weld Handling**

> **Rationale:** The cooling phase after welding is typical. The return of material flow and modest tool movement (to 20 mm) suggest **assembly**—perhaps adding a component, aligning parts, or moving the workpiece. Vibration is low, indicating no aggressive machining. This phase likely involves **handling or joining parts post-weld**, possibly with a robotic arm or positioning tool.

## **Step 3: Summary of Inferred Activities**

| Phase | Events | Label | Key Indicators |
|------|--------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | #1–3, #13–15 | **Idle / Machine Preparation** | Stable, low values across all sensors; no motion or energy spike |
| 2 | #4–6 | **Cutting Metal** | Rising temp, vibration, energy; steady flow; tool advancing |
| 3 | #7–9 | **Welding** | Peak temp (80°C), peak energy (5.0 kWh), no flow, stationary tool |
| 4 | #10–12 | **Assembling Parts / Post-Weld Handling** | Cooling, low vibration, flow resumes, tool moves to new position |

---

## **Overall Process Flow Inferred:**

```
[Idle]  [Cutting Metal]  [Welding]  [Assembling Parts]  [Idle]
```

This sequence reflects a typical manufacturing cycle:
1. Machine prepares (idle).
2. Cutting is performed to shape metal.
3. Welding joins components.
4. Assembly/handling moves or secures the piece.
5. System returns to idle.

##  Final Answer:

### **Labeled Activities:**

1. **Idle / Machine Preparation**  
   - *Events:* 1–3, 13–15  
   - *Rationale:* All sensors at baseline levels; no activity. Indicates rest or setup.

2. **Cutting Metal**  
   - *Events:* 4–6  
   - *Rationale:* Sharp rise in temperature, vibration, energy, and material flow; tool advancing. Classic signs of mechanical cutting.

3. **Welding**  
   - *Events:* 7–9  
   - *Rationale:* Peak temperature and energy consumption with no material flow and stationary tool. Matches thermal joining processes.

4. **Assembling Parts / Post-Weld Handling**  
   - *Events:* 10–12  
   - *Rationale:* Cooling after welding, low vibration, resumption of material flow, and tool movement suggest post-weld assembly or handling.
