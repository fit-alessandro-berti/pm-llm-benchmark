Looking at the loan application process, I'll add constraints to mitigate potential bias against applicants based on sensitive attributes. Here's the updated model with bias-mitigating constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # If sensitive attribute checks occur, manual review must coexist
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # If rejection occurs, bias mitigation check must coexist
        "Reject": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # After checking sensitive attributes, require bias mitigation check
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # Manual review must precede any rejection
        "ManualReview": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Bias mitigation check must precede any final decision
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure bias mitigation check is followed by manual review
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        # Prevent direct succession from sensitive checks to rejection
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {
        # Prevent immediate chaining from sensitive checks to rejection
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    }
}
```

## Explanation of Bias-Mitigating Constraints:

**1. Coexistence Constraints:**
- **Sensitive Attribute + Manual Review**: When sensitive attributes (race, gender, age) are checked, a `ManualReview` must occur in the same trace, ensuring human oversight for potentially sensitive decisions.
- **Rejection + Bias Mitigation Check**: Any `Reject` decision must coexist with a `BiasMitigationCheck`, ensuring that all rejections undergo bias evaluation.

**2. Response Constraints:**
- **Sensitive Checks  Bias Mitigation**: After checking any sensitive attribute, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must follow, ensuring immediate evaluation of potential bias triggers.

**3. Precedence Constraints:**
- **Manual Review  Rejection**: A `ManualReview` must precede any `Reject` decision, requiring human validation before negative outcomes.
- **Bias Check  Final Decision**: A `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede any `FinalDecision`, ensuring bias evaluation before process completion.

**4. Succession Constraints:**
- **Bias Check  Manual Review**: A `BiasMitigationCheck` must be followed by `ManualReview`, ensuring that bias evaluations lead to human oversight.

**5. Non-succession Constraints:**
- **Sensitive Checks  Rejection**: Prevent direct succession from sensitive attribute checks to rejection decisions, eliminating the possibility of immediate biased outcomes based on demographic information.

These constraints work together to create multiple safeguards against discriminatory decision-making by ensuring that: (1) sensitive information processing always involves human oversight, (2) rejection decisions undergo both bias evaluation and manual review, and (3) there are mandatory intervening steps between sensitive attribute exposure and negative decisions.
