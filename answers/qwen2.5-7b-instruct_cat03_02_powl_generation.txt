Sure, let's construct the POWL model for the described scenario. We will follow the steps outlined in the scenario and use the appropriate classes and operators to represent the process. Here is the Python code to define the POWL model:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
SR = Transition(label="SR")
CS = Transition(label="CS")
DA = Transition(label="DA")
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")
DnR = Transition(label="DnR")
CD = Transition(label="CD")
MD = Transition(label="MD")
QA = Transition(label="QA")
SA = Transition(label="SA")
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")

# Define silent transitions
skip = SilentTransition()

# Construct the POWL model step by step

# Step 1: SR and CS
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR])
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# Step 2: Parallel DA and ACI
parallel_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
root.nodes.append(parallel_tasks)
root.order.add_edge(CS, parallel_tasks)

# Step 3: Loop for BNC and DnR
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DnR])
root.nodes.append(loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(parallel_tasks, loop_config)

# Step 4: XOR between CD and MD
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])
root.nodes.append(deployment_choice)
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, deployment_choice)

# Step 5: Partial order for QA and SA
final_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
root.nodes.append(final_tasks)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, final_tasks)

# Step 6: Final GLA
root.order.add_edge(final_tasks, GLA)

# Print the constructed POWL model for verification
print(root)
```

### Explanation:

1. **SR and CS**: The process starts with a service request verification (`SR`) followed by contract setup (`CS`).
2. **Parallel DA and ACI**: After `CS`, the `DA` and `ACI` tasks can be performed concurrently.
3. **Loop for BNC and DnR**: After `DA` and `ACI` are completed, the process enters a loop where `BNC` is executed. If there are issues, the `DnR` step is performed. This loop repeats until the network is stable.
4. **XOR between CD and MD**: Once the network is configured, the process chooses between `CD` (containerized deployment) and `MD` (monolithic deployment).
5. **Partial order for QA and SA**: After the deployment, QA and SA can be done in any order or concurrently.
6. **Final GLA**: GLA can occur only after both QA and SA are completed.

This code constructs the POWL model as described and includes all necessary transitions, silent transitions, partial orders, and loop and exclusive choice nodes.
