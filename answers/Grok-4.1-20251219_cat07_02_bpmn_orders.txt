This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) swimlane diagram** that depicts the end-to-end order fulfillment process for a manufacturing company. The diagram is divided into four horizontal swimlanes, each representing a different department or role responsible for parts of the process:

1. **Sales** (top lane)
2. **Production** (second lane)
3. **Procurement** (third lane, with a subprocess)
4. **Warehouse** (bottom lane)

### Overall Flow Overview
The process starts every Monday morning in Sales when a customer order arrives, and it continues through checking, production planning, manufacturing, material handling (if needed), and finally shipping and invoicing.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Sales Lane
- **Start Event**: "Monday morning" – A timed start event triggers the process weekly.
- **Task**: Check order for completeness.
- **Decision Gateway**: Is the order already in the database?
  - **No**: Check if customer is in the database.
    - **No**: Add customer to the database.
    - **Yes or after adding**: Add customer order to the database.
  - **Yes**: Proceed directly.
- After the order is in the database:
  - **Task**: Send order details (message flow) to Production.
  - **Task**: Draft invoice.
  - **Task**: Send invoice (triggered later by "Invoice sent" from Production/Warehouse).

#### 2. Production Lane
- Receives "Order details arrive" message.
- **Decision Gateway**: Material not faulty? (checks availability/quality of materials)
  - **Yes (normal path)**:
    - **Task**: Plan production.
    - **Task**: Manufacture product.
    - **Event**: Product complete → sends "Product complete" message to Warehouse.
  - **No (exception path)**:
    - Triggers the **Material Compensation Subprocess** in Procurement (see below).

#### 3. Procurement Lane – Material Compensation Subprocess
This is an expanded/collapsed subprocess that handles cases where materials are faulty or insufficient:
- Triggered when "Material not faulty" gateway in Production answers "No".
- **Task**: Order materials.
- **Parallel Gateway**: Splits into two concurrent paths:
  - **Task**: Return material (presumably the faulty one).
  - **Task**: Check materials (new ones).
- After both are done, it converges and leads to **Order cancellation** end event if issues persist (this path seems to terminate the order abnormally).

#### 4. Warehouse Lane
- Receives "Product complete" message from Production.
- **Task**: Send product → "Product sent".
- This triggers "Invoice sent" back to Sales (to finalize and send the drafted invoice).

### Key Elements and Notation Used
- **Circles**: Events (thin start, intermediate message events with envelopes, thick end events).
- **Rounded rectangles**: Tasks/activities.
- **Diamonds**: Gateways (decision points).
- **Dashed arrows**: Message flows between lanes/departments.
- **Swimlanes**: Clear separation of responsibilities.
- **Subprocess**: The "Material Compensation Subprocess" is shown expanded to detail the exception handling.

### Summary of the Process Goal
The diagram models a weekly order processing cycle that involves:
- Validating and registering customer orders (Sales).
- Planning and manufacturing the product (Production).
- Handling material issues via procurement if needed.
- Shipping the finished product (Warehouse).
- Invoicing the customer (Sales).

It includes both the happy path (material available → produce → ship → invoice) and an exception path for material problems, which may lead to order cancellation.

This type of BPMN diagram is commonly used to document, analyze, and improve cross-departmental business processes in manufacturing or order-to-cash scenarios.
