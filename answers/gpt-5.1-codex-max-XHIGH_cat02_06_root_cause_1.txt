Below is a concise view of the total cycle times by case and the main patterns that stand out, followed by likely root causes and recommendations.

### 1) Long-Running Cases
- **102:** ~25h 10m (2024-03-01 08:05  2024-03-02 09:15)
- **104:** ~24h 10m (2024-03-01 08:20  2024-03-02 08:30)
- **105:** ~49h 05m (2024-03-01 08:25  2024-03-03 09:30)

By contrast, **101** (~2h 15m) and **103** (~1h 20m) are much shorter, suggesting 102, 104, and 105 are outliers.

### 2) Potential Root Causes

1) **Escalations to Level-2**  
   - Cases **102** and **105** both escalate; each incurs a large idle period afterward:
     - 102: Escalate at 11:30  next activity (Investigate) at 14:00  Resolve next day at 09:00.
     - 105: Escalate at 10:00  next L2 Investigate at 14:00 the following day  Resolve another day later at 09:00.
   - These handoffs and waits after escalation are major contributors to the long duration.

2) **Large Waiting Gaps Between Steps (Especially Before Investigation/Resolution)**  
   - **102**: From Investigate (14:00) to Resolve (09:00 next day) is ~19 hours.
   - **104**: From Assign (09:30) to Investigate (13:00) is 3.5+ hours; then to Resolve next morning (~19 hours gap).
   - **105**: From L2 escalation (10:00) to L2 Investigate next day (14:00) is ~28 hours; then to Resolve the following morning (~19 hours).
   - These gaps suggest queueing/backlog or limited coverage outside normal hours.

3) **Out-of-Hours/Weekend Effects**  
   - All long-running cases span overnight; 105 spans a full weekend. Limited weekend/after-hours coverage likely drives the prolonged waits after escalation or investigation.

4) **Duplicate Investigations After Escalation** (Case 105)  
   - An initial “Investigate Issue” before escalation is followed by another “Investigate Issue” after escalation. If any findings are not passed efficiently to Level-2, it can cause rework and delays.

### 3) How These Factors Increase Cycle Time & Recommendations

- **Escalation Delays & Queueing:**  
  Each handoff to Level-2 adds waiting time if L2 is understaffed or has separate queues.  
  **Recommendation:**  
  - Set SLAs for L2 response; track time from escalation to first L2 action.  
  - Increase or flex L2 staffing during peak or weekend hours.  
  - Improve handoff quality so L2 can resolve faster (reduce rework/second investigations).

- **Long Idle Gaps Before Investigation/Resolution:**  
  Delays between Assign  Investigate and Investigate  Resolve are significant drivers.  
  **Recommendation:**  
  - Monitor queue times between activities; flag tickets if idle beyond threshold.  
  - Consider earlier triage and prioritization for complex tickets likely to be escalated.  
  - Ensure clear ownership so tickets don’t stall waiting for the next step.

- **Weekend/Off-Hours Coverage:**  
  Overnight and weekend spans suggest limited availability or lower priority outside business hours.  
  **Recommendation:**  
  - Provide on-call/shift coverage for escalated or high-priority cases.  
  - Auto-schedule follow-ups at shift start with higher priority for aging tickets.

- **Avoid Rework on Escalation:**  
  Duplicate investigations (e.g., Case 105) slow resolution if findings are not transferred well.  
  **Recommendation:**  
  - Standardize escalation packages (complete notes, logs, steps already tried) to reduce the need for repeated investigation by L2.

By addressing escalation handling, reducing idle time between steps, and tightening weekend/off-hours coverage, you can significantly reduce the cycle times seen in the outlier cases.
