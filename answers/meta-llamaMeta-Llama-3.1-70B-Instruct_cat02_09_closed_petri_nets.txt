Here are the opposite and more general concepts for each of the given Petri net concepts:

1. **Source Place**
	* Opposite concept: **Sink Place**: A place with no outgoing arcs, i.e., a place that cannot produce tokens.
	* More general concept: **Boundary Place**: A place that is either a source place or a sink place, i.e., a place that has either no incoming arcs or no outgoing arcs.
2. **Immediate Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Delayed Transition**: A transition that cannot fire immediately, i.e., a transition with a non-zero delay or a transition that requires a certain condition to be met before firing.
	* More general concept: **Timed Transition**: A transition with a delay or a time interval associated with it, which can be either immediate (zero delay) or delayed (non-zero delay).
3. **Live Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Dead Transition**: A transition that can never fire, i.e., a transition that is disabled in all possible markings.
	* More general concept: **Potentially Firable Transition**: A transition that can fire in at least one possible marking, but may not be live (i.e., may not be able to fire in all possible markings).
4. **Bounded Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Unbounded Net**: A net that can produce an arbitrary number of tokens in at least one place, i.e., a net with no bound on the number of tokens.
	* More general concept: **K-Bounded Net**: A net that is bounded by some integer k, i.e., a net where the number of tokens in each place is bounded by k.
5. **Free Choice Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Conflict Net**: A net where every transition has a conflict with another transition, i.e., a net where every transition is in conflict with at least one other transition.
	* More general concept: **Well-Formed Net**: A net that satisfies certain structural properties, such as the absence of structural conflicts or the presence of a certain type of symmetry, but may not necessarily be free choice.
