Here are the opposite concepts, more general concepts, and explanations for each of the given concepts in the Petri nets field:

1. **Source Place**
	* Opposite concept: **Sink Place**: A place with no outgoing arcs, i.e., a place that can only receive tokens, but cannot send them to any transition.
	* More general concept: **Place with limited connectivity**: A place that has a restricted number of incoming or outgoing arcs, but not necessarily zero.
2. **Immediate Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Timed Transition**: A transition with a non-zero delay or firing time, i.e., a transition that takes some time to fire after it is enabled.
	* More general concept: **Transition with priority**: A transition that has a priority level associated with it, which determines the order in which it is fired among a set of enabled transitions.
3. **Live Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Dead Transition**: A transition that can never be enabled, i.e., a transition that does not have enough input tokens to fire.
	* More general concept: **Potentially enabled transition**: A transition that may become enabled at some point in the future, either by receiving more input tokens or by the firing of other transitions.
4. **Bounded Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Unbounded Net**: A net where the number of tokens in some places can grow indefinitely.
	* More general concept: **K-Bounded Net**: A net where the number of tokens in each place is bounded by a constant k, but k can be arbitrarily large.
5. **Free Choice Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Conflicting Choice Net**: A net where there are conflicts between transitions, i.e., transitions that are enabled by overlapping sets of input tokens.
	* More general concept: **Partially Free Choice Net**: A net where some transitions have free choice, but others are involved in conflicts.

Please note that these opposite and more general concepts are not universally agreed upon and may have variations depending on the specific application or research area within Petri nets.
