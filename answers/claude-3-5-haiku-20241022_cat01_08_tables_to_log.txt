**Notes and Observations:**
1. Each order has a complete event log showing its lifecycle from creation to payment.
2. Multiple item pickings are represented as separate events where applicable.
3. Some orders (like Order 1002) have multiple shipments or invoices, which are reflected in the log.
4. Resources (Sales Persons, Warehouse Staff, Carriers, Billing Clerks) are included where known.
5. Payment events do not have a specific resource as payment processing might be automated.

The event log provides a comprehensive view of the order processing workflow, suitable for process mining analysis.
