Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To effectively analyze TechSolve's resource behavior and assignment patterns, we will use the event log data to understand the performance and behavior of individual agents and support tiers (L1, L2, L3). The key metrics we will focus on are workload distribution, activity processing times per agent/tier, first-call resolution rate for L1, frequency of handling specific ticket types/skills, and the utilization of specific skills across the agent pool.

Resource Interaction Analysis

To uncover the actual assignment patterns, we will conduct resource interaction analysis. This involves analyzing the sequence of events between agents and the corresponding workflows to identify actual resource interactions. By examining these interactions, we can identify instances where agents are actually performing the tasks specified in their assignments.

Social Network Analysis Based on Handovers

We will also perform social network analysis based on handovers. A handover occurs when an agent transitions from one task or agent pool to another. By analyzing these handovers, we can identify patterns in resource assignment that might not be apparent through other means. This can help us understand how agents are moving between tasks and how this affects resource availability.

Role Discovery

Role discovery involves identifying the roles or responsibilities associated with different agents or groups. By analyzing the event log, we can infer the roles played by various agents and identify potential bottlenecks in the assignment process.

Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Based on the analysis above, we can identify specific resource-related problems. These include bottlenecks caused by insufficient availability of agents with specific required skills, delays introduced by frequent or unnecessary ticket reassignments or escalations, impact of incorrect initial assignments by L1 or dispatchers, underperforming or overloaded agents/teams, and correlation between resource assignment patterns and SLA breaches.

Quantifying Impact of Issues

To quantify the impact of these issues, we can use data analysis techniques such as regression analysis or process mining. For example, we can examine the relationship between the frequency of ticket reassignments and the number of SLA breaches.

Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

The root cause of the identified assignment problems can be identified through variant analysis. This involves comparing cases with smooth assignments versus those with many reassignments to identify patterns or factors that contributed to poor assignment decisions.

Process Mining for Improved Resource Assignment Strategies

Based on the insights gained from analyzing resource behavior and assignment patterns, we can propose at least three distinct, concrete, data-driven strategies to improve resource assignment logic.

Implementing Skill-Based Routing

Skill-based routing involves using the skills required for each task to assign agents to tasks. This strategy takes into account the expertise of agents and can help reduce reassignments. By analyzing the event log, we can identify tasks that require specific skills and assign agents accordingly.

Weighted Workload Analysis

Weighted workload analysis involves considering the workload of each agent and the types of tasks assigned to them. This strategy helps identify agents who are overloaded and can be reassigned to less demanding tasks. By analyzing the event log, we can identify which agents are underutilized and reassign them to more critical tasks.

Predictive Assignment

Predictive assignment involves analyzing ticket characteristics (category, description keywords) to anticipate required skills and complexity. This strategy helps identify tasks that require specific skills and assigns agents accordingly. By analyzing the event log, we can identify which tasks require specific skills and assign agents accordingly.

Dynamic Reallocation

Dynamic reallocation involves dynamically reassigning agents between tasks or agent pools based on real-time demand patterns. This strategy helps optimize resource utilization and reduces reassignments. By analyzing the event log, we can identify which agents are overutilized and reassign them to less demanding tasks.

Simulation and Implementation

To evaluate the potential impact of these proposed strategies, we can simulate the process using business process simulation tools. This involves creating a simulation of the process and analyzing the impact of the proposed strategies on the desired outcome (e.g., reduced resolution time, fewer reassignments, improved SLA rate).

Monitoring Effectiveness

To monitor the effectiveness of the new resource assignment strategies, we can track key resource-related KPIs and process views continuously using process mining dashboards. This will provide valuable insights into the impact of the proposed strategies and help identify areas for further improvement.

By using process mining techniques to analyze resource behavior and assignment patterns, we can identify specific resource-related problems, quantify the impact of these issues, and propose data-driven strategies to improve resource assignment logic. The proposed strategies, including skill-based routing, weighted workload analysis, predictive assignment, and dynamic reallocation, aim to optimize resource utilization, reduce reassignments, and improve SLA compliance.
