To solve the problem, we need to filter out cases (`case_id`) that have more than six events and return only the events from cases with six or fewer events. Here's how we can approach this step by step:

1. **Count Events per Case**: Use the `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of events for each `case_id`.
2. **Filter Cases**: Identify the `case_id`s that have six or fewer events using a `HAVING` clause or a subquery.
3. **Return Filtered Events**: Use the filtered `case_id`s to retrieve all events belonging to those cases.

Below is the DuckDB SQL query that implements this logic:

```sql
WITH case_event_count AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_event_count c
ON
    e.case_id = c.case_id;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Step 1: Count Events per Case**:
   - The `WITH case_event_count` Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the number of events for each `case_id` using `COUNT(*)`.
   - The `GROUP BY case_id` groups the rows by `case_id`, and the `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` ensures that only cases with six or fewer events are included in the result.

2. **Step 2: Filter Events**:
   - The main query selects all columns (`e.*`) from the `event_log` table (`e`).
   - It performs an inner join between the `event_log` table and the `case_event_count` CTE on the `case_id` column. This ensures that only events belonging to cases with six or fewer events are included in the final result.

### Why This Approach Works:
- The `WITH` clause simplifies the query by breaking it into logical steps.
- The `HAVING` clause ensures that only cases meeting the condition (`<= 6` events) are considered.
- The `JOIN` operation efficiently filters the events based on the precomputed counts.

### Alternative Approach (Without CTE):
If you prefer not to use a CTE, you can achieve the same result with a subquery:

```sql
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
WHERE
    e.case_id IN (
        SELECT
            case_id
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
        HAVING
            COUNT(*) <= 6
    );
```

### Key Differences:
- The subquery approach uses `IN` to filter `case_id`s directly in the `WHERE` clause.
- Both approaches are functionally equivalent, but the CTE version is often more readable and easier to debug.

### Final Answer:
The recommended query is:

```sql
WITH case_event_count AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_event_count c
ON
    e.case_id = c.case_id;
```
