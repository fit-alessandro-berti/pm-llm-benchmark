### Inferred Case Groupings

Based on the event attributes, I inferred three distinct cases by grouping events that share consistent patient demographics (age and gender), logical activity sequences (e.g., registration  triage/consult  tests/procedures  discharge), departmental alignment, and timestamp progression. Events for the same patient form a coherent patient journey without contradictions, while interleaving reflects parallel processing in a busy hospital.

- **Patient demographics as keys**: 
  - Case 1: 45-year-old male (ER journey for leg injury/fracture).
  - Case 2: 62-year-old female (ER journey for infection, involving labs).
  - Case 3: 28-year-old male (Surgery journey for scheduled knee procedure).

No events could plausibly belong to multiple cases, and all 18 events are accounted for. Below, I list each case with its grouped events (by original line number), timestamps, and a brief rationale for the grouping.

#### Case 1: ER Injury (45M, Private Insurance)
Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
- 1. 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, Register patient (ER, Admin Clerk).  
- 4. 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z, Initial triage (ER, Nurse Joy, triage_code=3).  
- 7. 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, X-ray imaging (Radiology, Radiology Tech, body_part=left_leg).  
- 12. 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, Doctor consultation (ER, Dr. Lee, diagnosis=hairline_fracture).  
- 15. 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z, Patient discharged (ER, Ward Clerk, followup=outpatient_clinic).  

**Rationale**: Standard ER flow for injury. Starts with registration, progresses to triage and imaging (leg-specific, tying to fracture diagnosis), ends with discharge. Timestamps increase sequentially within the case (~25 min total). Department shifts to Radiology are expected for tests.

#### Case 2: ER Infection (62F, Public Insurance)
Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
- 2. 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z, Register patient (ER, Admin Clerk).  
- 5. 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z, Initial triage (ER, Nurse Mark, triage_code=2).  
- 8. 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, Lab test requested (ER, Dr. Smith, test_type=blood_panel).  
- 10. 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, Lab test completed (Laboratory, Lab Technician, results=normal_levels).  
- 11. 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, Doctor consultation (ER, Dr. Smith, diagnosis=minor_infection).  
- 14. 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, Prescription created (ER, Dr. Smith, medication=antibiotics).  
- 17. 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, Patient discharged (ER, Ward Clerk, followup=pharmacy_pickup).  

**Rationale**: Typical ER flow for infection evaluation. Registration  triage (higher priority code=2)  lab request/completion (results inform diagnosis)  consultation/prescription (infection/antibiotics match)  discharge. Timestamps increase (~28 min total). Consistent ER/Lab departments; Dr. Smith recurs logically.

#### Case 3: Scheduled Surgery (28M, Private Insurance)
Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  
- 3. 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, Register patient (Surgery, Admin Clerk).  
- 6. 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, Doctor consultation (Surgery, Dr. Lee, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery).  
- 9. 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, Surgery preparation (Surgery, Surgical Nurse, prep_type=general_anesthesia).  
- 13. 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, Surgery performed (Surgery, Dr. Lee, procedure=arthroscopy).  
- 16. 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, Recovery room (Surgery, Recovery Nurse, condition=stable).  
- 18. 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, Patient discharged (Surgery, Ward Clerk, followup=physiotherapy_sessions).  

**Rationale**: Elective surgery pathway. Registration directly in Surgery (common for scheduled cases)  pre-op consult (knee-specific)  preparation  procedure (arthroscopy fits knee surgery)  recovery  discharge (physio followup aligns). Timestamps increase (~33 min total). Consistent Surgery focus; Dr. Lee recurs for consult and surgery.
