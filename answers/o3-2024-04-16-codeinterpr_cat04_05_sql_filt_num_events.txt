Here is a concise DuckDB query that keeps only the events that belong to cases with six or fewer total events:

```sql
-- Return events only from cases that have  6 events
SELECT  el.*
FROM    event_log AS el
WHERE   el.case_id IN (          -- keep cases that satisfy the count condition
        SELECT  case_id
        FROM    event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
        HAVING  COUNT(*) <= 6     -- omit cases with more than 6 events
)
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp; -- optional, for readable output
```

Explanation  
1. The sub-query groups the table by `case_id` and retains only those case IDs whose event count is  6.  
2. The outer query returns all rows (`*`) from `event_log` whose `case_id` appears in that list, thereby filtering out every event from cases that exceed six events.
