Let's go through the **task step-by-step** to identify **cases with performance issues**, analyze the **root causes** linked to **Resource, Region, and Complexity**, and finally **propose actionable mitigation strategies**.

---

##  Step 1: Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Completion Times

We need to compute the **total duration** (from Submit Claim to Close Claim) for each case.

### Compute Duration per Case

We'll calculate the time difference between:
- **Submit Claim** (first event) and
- **Close Claim** (last event)

---

#### Case 2001
- Submit: 2024-04-01 09:00  
- Close: 2024-04-01 10:30  
 Duration = 1h 30m = **90 minutes**

#### Case 2002
- Submit: 2024-04-01 09:05  
- Close: 2024-04-02 11:00  
 Duration = 2 days 1h 55m = **295 minutes**

#### Case 2003
- Submit: 2024-04-01 09:10  
- Close: 2024-04-03 09:30  
 Duration = 2 days 2h 20m = **500 minutes**

#### Case 2004
- Submit: 2024-04-01 09:20  
- Close: 2024-04-01 10:45  
 Duration = 1h 25m = **85 minutes**

#### Case 2005
- Submit: 2024-04-01 09:25  
- Close: 2024-04-04 14:30  
 Duration = 3 days 5h 5m = **775 minutes**

---

### Duration Summary (in minutes):

| Case ID | Duration (minutes) |
|--------|--------------------|
| 2001   | 90                 |
| 2002   | 295                |
| 2003   | 500                |
| 2004   | 85                 |
| 2005   | 775                |

---

###  Identify "Performance Issues"

- **2001**: Fast (90 min)  Normal
- **2004**: Fast (85 min)  Normal
- **2002**: Moderate (295 min)  Slight delay
- **2003**: Long (500 min)  Performance issue
- **2005**: **Extremely long (775 min)**  **Severe performance issue**

>  **Cases with performance issues: 2003 and 2005**

---

##  Step 2: Analyze Root Causes via Attributes

We now examine **Resource, Region, and Complexity** for these high-duration cases.

---

### Case 2003 (500 min)
- **Complexity**: High  
- **Region**: A (Region A)  
- **Resource**:  
  - Submit: CSR_Jane  
  - Evaluate: Adjuster_Mike  
  - Request Additional Docs: Adjuster_Mike (twice)  
  - Approve: Manager_Bill  
  - Pay: Finance_Alan  
  - Close: CSR_Jane  

 Key Observations:
- **High Complexity**  required **two requests for additional documents** (at 11:00 and 17:00)
- These delays cause **significant gaps** between evaluations and approvals
- Approval happens on **Day 2 (2024-04-02)**, after a long wait
- Despite being in **Region A (faster region?)**, the **high complexity** drives delays

>  Root cause: **High Complexity  Multiple document requests  Process delays**

---

### Case 2005 (775 min)
- **Complexity**: High  
- **Region**: B  
- **Resource**:  
  - Submit: CSR_Paul  
  - Evaluate: Adjuster_Lisa  
  - Request Additional Docs: **Three times** (11:30, 17:00, 15:00 on 04-03)  
  - Approve: Manager_Bill  
  - Pay: Finance_Carl  
  - Close: CSR_Paul  

 Key Observations:
- **High Complexity**  **three requests** for additional documents
- Even more **document back-and-forth** than Case 2003
- Approval delayed until **Day 4 (2024-04-04)**  3 days after submission
- Request events are **spaced over multiple days**, indicating **ongoing friction**

>  Root cause: **High Complexity + Multiple Requests  Extended processing time**

---

### Cross-Check Other Attributes

| Attribute | Case 2003 | Case 2005 | Case 2002 (Medium) | Case 2001/2004 (Low) |
|---------|----------|----------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Complexity | High     | High     | Medium             | Low                    |
| Region    | A        | B        | B                  | A                      |
| Number of Document Requests | 2 | 3 | 1 | 0 |

 **Region A vs. B**:  
- Region A (2003) had 2 document requests  500 min  
- Region B (2005) had 3  775 min  
 **No clear regional performance difference**; **Region B does not appear slower**.  
 **Document requests dominate duration**, not region.

 **Resource**:  
- All resources are experienced (e.g., Adjuster_Lisa, Mike, Bill)  
- No evidence of individual resource inefficiency  
- **No pattern of delays due to specific resource**  

 **Complexity**:  
- **All high-complexity claims** (2003, 2005) have **multiple document requests**  
- **Low-complexity claims** (2001, 2004) have **no such delays**  
- **Medium-complexity (2002)** has only one document request  295 min  moderate delay

>  **Strong correlation: High Complexity  More document requests  Longer processing time**

---

##  Step 3: Root Cause Analysis & Explanations

###  Root Causes of Long Case Durations:

| Root Cause | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **1. High Complexity  Multiple Document Requests** | Claims with high complexity require more verification, detailed evidence, and validation. This leads to repeated "Request Additional Documents" events, which cause delays in evaluation and approval. The process stalls while waiting for documents. |
| **2. Lack of Early Document Verification** | The process does not detect or flag complexity early. A high-complexity claim is not flagged during evaluation, leading to late discovery of missing info and repeated back-and-forth. |
| **3. Inadequate Workflow for Complex Claims** | There's no predefined escalation path or time limits for document requests. Without clear timelines, document requests can be delayed indefinitely. |
| **4. Regional Variation is Minimal** | Both Region A and B handle high-complexity claims with similar delays. Performance is not tied to region, suggesting regional training or infrastructure differences are not the issue. |
| **5. Resource Overlap (No Bottleneck)** | All resources are used appropriately. No single resource is consistently delaying the process. Delays are due to **process design**, not personnel. |

---

##  Step 4: Recommendations to Mitigate Root Causes

###  1. **Introduce Complexity-Based Risk Scoring at Evaluation Stage**
- Add a **pre-evaluation complexity score** based on claim type, policy, damage, or prior history.
- Automatically flag high-complexity claims and assign them to **specialist evaluators** or **dedicated review teams**.

>  Benefit: Early intervention avoids delays in document requests.

---

###  2. **Implement Time-Bound Document Request Workflow**
- Set **maximum time limits** (e.g., 48 hours) for document requests.
- If documents are not received within the limit, **auto-escalate** to a supervisor or trigger a review.

>  Benefit: Prevents indefinite waiting; reduces time from days to hours.

---

###  3. **Standardize and Automate Document Request Templates**
- Create **pre-filled, guided forms** for high-complexity claims.
- Use automated email reminders to policyholders.

>  Benefit: Reduces back-and-forth and ensures all required documents are requested upfront.

---

###  4. **Add a "Document Request Count" Metric to Performance Dashboards**
- Monitor average number of document requests per claim.
- Flag cases with 2+ requests as "high-risk" and flag for early review.

>  Benefit: Enables proactive monitoring and process improvement.

---

###  5. **Reevaluate Claim Classification Process**
- Review current criteria for defining "High Complexity".
- Consider adding **predictive analytics** to classify complexity based on historical data.

>  Benefit: More accurate classification leads to better resource allocation and process design.

---

###  6. **Train Evaluators on Complex Claims Handling**
- Provide training on how to identify early signs of complexity and how to assess claims efficiently.

>  Benefit: Improves evaluation speed and reduces need for document requests.

| Case ID | Duration (min) | Complexity | Document Requests | Root Cause | Mitigation Action |
|--------|----------------|-----------|--------------------|------------|--------------------|
| 2001   | 90             | Low       | 0                  | Normal     | —                  |
| 2002   | 295            | Medium    | 1                  | Moderate   | Monitor closely   |
| 2003   | 500            | High      | 2                  | High Complexity  Multiple Docs | Introduce complexity scoring, time limits |
| 2004   | 85             | Low       | 0                  | Normal     | —                  |
| 2005   | 775            | High      | 3                  | High Complexity  Multiple Docs | Escalation rules, automation, training |

##  Final Answer

### 1. **Cases with performance issues**:  
 **Case 2003** and **Case 2005**

### 2. **Root Causes**:  
- **High Complexity** is the primary driver of long durations.  
- High-complexity claims require **multiple requests for additional documents**, which significantly extend processing time.  
- These delays are not due to specific **resources** or **regions**, suggesting the issue lies in **process design and claim classification**.

### 3. **Mitigation Recommendations**:  
- Implement **complexity-based risk scoring** at evaluation.  
- Introduce **time-bound document request limits** with auto-escalation.  
- Standardize **document templates** and **reminders** for high-complexity claims.  
- Add **monitoring dashboards** for document request frequency.  
- Train evaluators to identify and manage complex claims early.
