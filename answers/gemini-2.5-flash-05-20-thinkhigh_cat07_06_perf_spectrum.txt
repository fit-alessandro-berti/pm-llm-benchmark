This visualization depicts a process flow over time, tracking individual cases through three distinct stages related to fine management. It spans approximately 13 years, from early 2000 to mid-2013.

Here's a breakdown of the key elements and what they represent:

1.  **Process Stages (Horizontal Lines):**
    *   **"Send Fine" (Top Line):** This is the initial event where a fine is issued.
    *   **"Insert Fine Notification" (Middle Line):** This represents an intermediate step, likely the formal recording or sending of a notification about the fine.
    *   **"Send for Credit Collection" (Bottom Line):** This is the final stage shown, indicating that the fine has been escalated for credit collection.

2.  **Time Axis (Horizontal):**
    *   The bottom of the graph displays a timeline, with dates ranging from "2000-01-25" on the left to "2013-04-24" on the right. This allows observation of events and delays over an extended period.

3.  **Individual Cases (Lines):**
    *   Each vertical or diagonal line represents a single case (e.g., a single fine) moving through the process.
    *   **Grey Lines:** Connect "Send Fine" to "Insert Fine Notification." These lines are predominantly vertical, indicating that the "Insert Fine Notification" step occurs almost immediately or with very minimal delay after the "Send Fine" event for most cases. The varying density of these lines along the top bar reflects periods of higher or lower frequency of fines being sent.
    *   **Red Lines (with varying opacity):** Connect "Insert Fine Notification" to "Send for Credit Collection." These lines are notably diagonal, indicating a significant and variable time delay between the fine notification and being sent for credit collection.
        *   The **slope** of these red lines is crucial: a steeper slope indicates a shorter delay, while a shallower slope signifies a longer delay.
        *   The lines often form **distinct "fans" or "wedges"**, particularly noticeable in the second half of the time series. This suggests that batches of cases, perhaps those that received notifications around a similar time, are later sent for credit collection in bursts, potentially after a certain fixed or variable period has elapsed or after specific conditions are met.
        *   The **opacity/color intensity** of the red lines likely indicates the density of cases: where the red appears darker, more cases are following a similar path or experiencing a similar delay.

**In summary, the visualization effectively illustrates:**

*   **High initial efficiency:** Fines are quickly followed by notifications.
*   **Significant and patterned delays:** There's a notable time gap and variability in when cases are escalated for credit collection after a notification is issued.
*   **Batch processing/Waves:** Cases are not continuously sent for collection but appear to be processed in distinct batches or waves, creating the "fan" patterns.
*   **Trends over time:** One can observe how the volume of fines and the patterns of collection delays evolve over the 13-year period. For instance, the "fans" appear to become more pronounced and potentially wider (indicating a broader range of delays) towards the later years of the dataset.
