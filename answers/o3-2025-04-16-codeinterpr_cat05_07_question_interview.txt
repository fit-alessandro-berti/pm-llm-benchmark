Targeted, open-ended questions to deepen understanding of the property-onboarding process

Initial intake and documentation  
1. Through which channels (phone, email, web form, referrals, etc.) do landlords typically contact the regional office, and how do you decide which channel to steer them toward?  
2. What specific documents constitute a “complete” submission, and how do you define “outdated” for each (e.g., inspection report must be < 12 months old)?  
3. When documentation is incomplete, how is the follow-up tracked and escalated, and is there a time limit before an application is closed or put on hold?  

Data entry and record creation  
4. Who is responsible for entering property details into the central database, and what validation or double-check occurs to prevent data-entry errors?  
5. At what point—before or after verification—does the property appear in any internal dashboards or pipeline reports?  

Property-manager assignment  
6. How do you quantify a manager’s “current workload” and “track record” when matching them to a new property?  
7. If two managers are equally qualified, what tie-breakers or approval steps decide the assignment?  
8. Are landlords ever allowed to request a specific manager, and how is that handled?  

Kick-off meeting with the landlord  
9. What standardized topics or checklists guide the introductory call, and how are decisions from that call documented and shared with downstream teams?  
10. How do you capture special conditions (e.g., pet policy, furnished units) so they remain visible throughout marketing, leasing, and compliance reviews?  

Photography, inspection, and remediation  
11. What service-level targets (time-to-schedule, time-to-complete) exist for photographers and inspectors, and how do you monitor them?  
12. When an inspection uncovers issues, who decides whether the company or the landlord arranges contractors, and what approval thresholds (cost, scope) apply?  
13. How do you prevent marketing from going live before all required repairs or certifications are closed out?  

Marketing and pricing  
14. What inputs feed the internal pricing model, and how often is that model refreshed to reflect market trends?  
15. Who signs off on the final listing content and rental rate before “activation” in the portal?  

Tenant screening and lease negotiation  
16. Which criteria weigh most heavily in tenant selection (credit, income, references), and how do you document reasons for accepting or rejecting applicants to satisfy fair-housing rules?  
17. When multiple qualified applicants exist, how do you prioritize speed, lease length, or landlord preferences during negotiations?  
18. How do you handle landlord-requested custom clauses—who reviews and approves them for legal compliance?  

Quality checks, audits, and compliance  
19. At which milestones do compliance officers, financial analysts, and IT reviewers intervene, and what happens if they flag an issue after the lease is signed?  
20. Are there formal post-mortems or scorecards for each onboarding, and how are insights fed back into process improvements?  

Timing, hand-offs, and tools  
21. What is the typical end-to-end cycle time from initial landlord contact to tenant move-in, and where do the biggest delays usually occur?  
22. Which systems (CRM, project-management, shared drives) capture communication and tasks, and how is information synchronized across them to avoid duplicate data entry?  
23. How do you ensure seamless hand-offs when multiple regional offices or departments collaborate on the same property?  

Exception and risk management  
24. What are the most common exceptions you encounter (special insurance, historic properties, rent-control regulations), and what predefined paths—or escalation layers—exist to handle them?  
25. How do you measure the financial or reputational impact of exceptions, and who decides when to decline a property that falls outside standard parameters?
