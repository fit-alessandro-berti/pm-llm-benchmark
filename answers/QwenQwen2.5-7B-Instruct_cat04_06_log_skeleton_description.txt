Based on the provided constraints and activity occurrences, the process described appears to be a workflow for a declaration and payment request system. Here’s a high-level description of the process:

### 1. **User (Employee) Actions:**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: This is the initial step where an employee submits a declaration for approval. This activity can occur multiple times (0-7 times) as needed.
   - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**: This activity is never performed, which suggests that the submission is directly stored upon submission without any separate saving step.
   - **Saving**: If any of the activities from the above points (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE) are not met, the process cannot proceed.

### 2. **Approval Process:**
   - **Approval by REVIEWER**: The declaration goes through different levels of approval:
     - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR**: A supervisor then approves or rejects the declaration.
     - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER**: A pre-approver also reviews the declaration and can either approve or reject it.
     - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION**: If the declaration needs further administrative approval, the administrative level proceeds to approve or reject it.
   - **Approval By**: The declaration can be approved by different stakeholders (e.g., PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION) or rejected by various parties (e.g., SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, EMPLOYEE, PRE_APPROVER, MISSING, EMPLOYEE, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER).

### 3. **Types of Rejection:**
   - The declaration can be rejected for various reasons, leading to multiple paths and iterations:
     - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**: Rejected due to administrative issues.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**: Rejected due to supervisor's disapproval.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**: Rejected due to budgetary concerns.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**: Rejected due to user errors or issues.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**: Rejected during the pre-approval stage.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**: An error due to missing information.

### 4. **Workflow Flows:**
   - **Direct Approval and Rejection Patterns**:
     - If ** Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR** occurs, it is always followed by a type of rejection for missing information.
     - Similarly, ** Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER** and ** Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION** also lead to rejections.
   - **Key Exits**:
     - **Payment Handled**: The process ends when the **Payment Handled** activity is performed.
     - **Final Approvals**: After passing through necessary approvals, the ** Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** or ** Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER** can occur, which may lead to **Request Payment** or other subsequent activities.

### 5. **Activity Occurrences**:
   - Certain activities, such as **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION**, can occur multiple times, indicating that there might be additional levels of administrative review.
   - **Payment Handled** and **Request Payment** can each occur up to once during the process.

### 6. **Constraints** (Ordered as Given):
   - **Equivalence**: Certain actions are equivalent, like how **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL** can lead to different approvals.
   - **Always Before**: Before a submission can be delivered to a higher authority (like a supervisor or administrator), it must first be reviewed and possibly saved.
   - **Always After**: After a declaration is submitted, the system may immediately or eventually reject it with a specific reason.
   - **Never Together**: Certain activities cannot occur simultaneously or in direct succession, such as certain rejections preceding approvals.
   - **Activity Occurrences**: Specific bounds are set to control the frequency of occurrences for each activity to ensure the process remains efficient and coherent.
   - **Directly-Follows Constraints**: Specific sequences of activities are mandated, ensuring the workflow follows a logical order and that certain rejections come after certain approvals.

### Summary:
The process is a comprehensive workflow for handling declarations in an organization, where multiple stakeholders (e.g., employees, supervisors, administrators) need to approve or reject the declaration. The process can be iterative as rejections might lead to further modifications or re-submissions until the declaration either passes all approvals or is rejected. Payment handling is initiated once the declaration is fully approved.
