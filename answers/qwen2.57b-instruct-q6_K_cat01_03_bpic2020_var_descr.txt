Based on the provided process variants, it appears that there are several possible paths for handling a declaration, and each path can lead to different outcomes before finally getting to the payment handling stage. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the underlying process:

### General Workflow:
1. **Declaration Submission by Employee:**
   - The employee initiates a declaration.
2. **Approval/Rejection Stages:**
   - The declaration goes through various approval stages, which can include approval by Administration (ADMINISTRATION), Budget Owner (BUDGET OWNER), and Supervisor (SUPERVISOR).
3. **Final Approval:**
   - Once the final approval stage is reached (either by SUPERVISOR or BUDGET OWNER in some cases), a decision to either proceed with Request Payment or reject the declaration.
4. **Request for Payment:**
   - If the final approval is granted, the process moves on to request payment.
5. **Payment Handling:**
   - The payment handling step concludes the process.

### Variant Descriptions:
- **Variant 1:**
  - **Path:** SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
  - **Outcome:** Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 4618, performance = 810187.903)
  
- **Variant 2:**
  - **Path:** SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
  - **Outcome:** Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 2473, performance = 1084338.407)

- **Variant 3:**
  - **Path:** SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
  - **Outcome:** Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 1392, performance = 854633.975)
  
- **Variant 4:**
  - **Path:** SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
  - **Outcome:** Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 575, performance = 861058.409)

- **Rejection Scenarios:**
  - **Path:** SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR and possibly multiple rejections.
    - For example:
      - **Variant 5:** 
        - Path: SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
        - Outcome: Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 345, performance = 1604595.638)
      - **Variant 6:** 
        - Path: SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
        - Outcome: Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 188, performance = 2061236.516)
      
- **Missing Data:**
  - Some paths involve missing data or steps.
    - For example:
      - **Variant 7:** 
        - Path: SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> REJECTED by MISSING
        - Outcome: Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 40, performance = 1947246.400)

### Summary:
The process involves an initial submission from the employee followed by a series of approval stages (potentially involving multiple approvers or rejections) before reaching the final approval stage and proceeding to payment handling. The frequency and performance metrics indicate that some paths are more common than others, and certain rejection scenarios can lead to longer or shorter processes depending on the number of rejections involved.

This multi-step process ensures thorough review by various levels of management while also allowing for flexibility in different approval structures (e.g., involving PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER).
