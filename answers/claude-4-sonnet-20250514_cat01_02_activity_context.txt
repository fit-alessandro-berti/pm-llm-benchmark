## Analysis and Activity Renaming

### 1. Identification of Recurring Activities and Context Analysis

After analyzing the event log, I identified two activities that appear multiple times within cases with different contextual meanings:

**Verify Documents:**
- Appears 2 times in C001, 1 time in C002, 2 times in C003
- Context varies based on timing and preceding events

**Call Customer:**
- Appears 1 time in C001, 2 times in C002, 1 time in C003
- Context varies based on purpose and timing in the workflow

### 2. Contextual Interpretation and Renaming Strategy

**Verify Documents:**
- **First occurrence**: Initial document verification as part of standard process
- **Subsequent occurrences**: Re-verification after receiving additional documents or making account adjustments

**Call Customer:**
- **After incomplete verification**: Requesting missing documentation
- **During/after account work**: Clarifying discrepancies or confirming changes
- **For logistical reasons**: Requesting customer return to branch

### 4. Justification for Naming Choices

**Document Verification Activities:**
- **"Initial Document Verify"**: Used for the first verification attempt in each case, representing the standard document check as part of the initial process flow.
- **"Re-verify Documents"**: Used when documents are checked again after additional information is provided (C001) or account adjustments are made (C003). The "re-verify" prefix clearly indicates this is a repeat verification with new context.

**Customer Call Activities:**
- **"Call for Missing Documents"** (C001): Context clearly indicates the call is to request additional documentation after incomplete verification.
- **"Call for Clarification"** (C002): The call is made to clarify account discrepancies, not for missing documents.
- **"Call for Confirmation"** (C002): This is a follow-up call to confirm that account adjustments were satisfactory.
- **"Call for Customer Return"** (C003): Logistical call requesting the customer to return to the branch after stepping out.

**Key Contextual Clues Used:**
- **Temporal positioning**: When activities occur in the sequence
- **Preceding/following activities**: What happens before and after each occurrence
- **Additional context descriptions**: Explicit explanations of the activity purpose
- **Resource involvement**: Different resources sometimes indicate different contexts
- **Workflow logic**: Understanding the business process flow to infer activity purposes

This renaming approach creates a more precise process model that captures the nuanced differences in activity execution while maintaining clarity about the overall workflow structure.
