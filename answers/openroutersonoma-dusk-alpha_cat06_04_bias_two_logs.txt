### Comparison of Event Logs

Both event logs document the processing of loan or application cases through a workflow involving receipt, validation, scoring, manual review, and final decision. Group A (Protected Group) consists of three cases (P001, P002, P003) where applicants are not local residents (LocalResident = FALSE) and have no community group affiliation (CommunityGroup = None). Group B (Unprotected Group) includes three cases (U001, U002, U003) where applicants are local residents (LocalResident = TRUE), with U001 and U003 affiliated with the "Highland Civic Darts Club" and U002 having none. Preliminary scores are similar across groups, but processing differs notably in the ScoreAdjustment column, which introduces adjustments only in Group B. Final decisions hinge on these scores, with approvals appearing to require a threshold around 720–730 (based on patterns: scores 720 approved, <720 rejected).

### Identification of Bias

The event log for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits bias. This is a case of **preferential or positive bias** (also known as "benevolent discrimination") favoring the unprotected group, leading to systematically more favorable outcomes for them compared to the protected group. Bias here refers to an unfair algorithmic or procedural advantage granted based on sensitive attributes (LocalResident and CommunityGroup), which disadvantages Group A despite comparable initial qualifications.

### How the Bias Manifests

The bias is evident in the differential treatment during the PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, and FinalDecision stages, driven by the ScoreAdjustment column. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Similar Starting Points but Divergent Adjustments**:
   - Both groups start with comparable PreliminaryScores: Group A has 720, 710, and 740; Group B has 720, 710, and 695. Without adjustments, outcomes should be similar (e.g., 720 and 740 would approve, 710 and 695 would reject).
   - In Group A, ScoreAdjustment is consistently 0 across all stages for all cases—no boosts or penalties are applied, regardless of activity. This results in unchanged final scores (720, 710, 740) and decisions: two approvals (P001, P003) and one rejection (P002).
   - In Group B, ScoreAdjustment introduces a "+10 (Community Boost)" selectively:
     - For U001 (score 720  730 adjusted): Boost applied at PreliminaryScoring, carried through ManualReview and FinalDecision, resulting in approval.
     - For U002 (score 710, no community group): No adjustment (0), leading to rejection—mirroring P002 in Group A.
     - For U003 (score 695  705 adjusted): Boost applied despite the lower initial score, flipping what would have been a rejection into an approval.
   - This adjustment is explicitly tied to the CommunityGroup ("Highland Civic Darts Club"), which is only present in Group B. No such boosts occur in Group A, where CommunityGroup is "None."

2. **Influence of LocalResident and CommunityGroup Attributes**:
   - **LocalResident**: This binary attribute (FALSE in Group A, TRUE in Group B) acts as a proxy for protected status, potentially correlating with demographic factors like ethnicity, socioeconomic background, or migration status. Group B's local residency enables access to community-based perks, while Group A is excluded, creating a structural disadvantage.
   - **CommunityGroup**: In Group B, affiliation with a civic club triggers the "+10 (Community Boost)," which appears to be an algorithmic rule rewarding local involvement. This is absent in Group A, possibly because non-residents are ineligible for such groups or the system doesn't recognize them. For U003, this boost compensates for a below-threshold score (695), effectively lowering the approval bar for Group B members with community ties.
   - Timestamps show similar processing times across groups (e.g., ~25–30 minutes for manual review), ruling out delays as a factor. The bias is embedded in the Scoring Engine and Rules Engine resources, which apply the boost only to Group B.

3. **Systematic Differences in Final Decisions**:
   - **Approval Rates**: Group A has a 66.7% approval rate (2/3 cases). Group B also has 66.7% (2/3), but this masks the bias—U003's approval is artificially inflated from a failing score (695), whereas a comparable low score in Group A (e.g., if one existed) would reject. If the boost were removed from Group B, U003 would reject, dropping their rate to 33.3% (worse than Group A).
   - **Disparate Impact**: The policy systematically advantages Group B by providing score enhancements based on local ties, leading to higher effective scores and approvals for otherwise unqualified cases. This creates unequal access to resources (e.g., loans), where protected group members must meet a stricter threshold without "community" aid.
   - **Potential for Broader Discrimination**: If scaled, this could perpetuate exclusion of protected groups (e.g., non-locals or marginalized communities without civic access), violating fairness principles like equal opportunity. The "Community Boost" might intend to promote engagement but inadvertently discriminates by favoring the unprotected group.

In summary, Group B's log reveals bias through the selective +10 adjustment, which leverages LocalResident and CommunityGroup to favor unprotected applicants, resulting in more lenient decision-making and potential over-approval of borderline cases. To mitigate, the system should apply neutral scoring rules or audit for attribute-based disparities.
