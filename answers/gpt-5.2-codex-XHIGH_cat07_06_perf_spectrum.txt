The figure is a timebased “trace” or spaghetti plot of a threestep process.  
The horizontal axis is calendar time (from roughly Jan2000 to Apr2013), and the vertical axis lists three activities: **Send Fine** (top), **Insert Fine Notification** (middle), and **Send for Credit Collection** (bottom). Each thin line represents one case, linking the timestamps of these three events.

Most lines from **Send Fine** down to **Insert Fine Notification** are almost vertical, showing those two events occur nearly at the same time. The lines from **Insert Fine Notification** down to **Send for Credit Collection** slope to the right and fan out, indicating a much longer and highly variable delay before cases are sent to credit collection. The mass of overlapping grey lines gives the dense bands, while a subset of traces is highlighted in red (likely selected or exceptional cases).
