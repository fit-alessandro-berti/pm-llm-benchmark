Here's a Python implementation using pm4py to create a POWL model for a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process. This example includes activities like 'Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods', 'Invoice Verification', and 'Payment'. It also includes choice structures (XOR) for handling different scenarios, such as receiving goods before or after invoice verification, and loops for repetitive tasks like re-verifying invoices.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
create_po = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
invoice_verification = Transition(label="Invoice Verification")
payment = Transition(label="Payment")
reverify_invoice = Transition(label="Re-verify Invoice")

# Define silent transitions
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define choice structures (XOR)
xor_receive_before_verification = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[receive_goods, skip])
xor_receive_after_verification = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[receive_goods, invoice_verification])

# Define loop structure for re-verifying invoices
loop_invoice_verification = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[invoice_verification, reverify_invoice])

# Define the main process flow with partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[create_po, xor_receive_before_verification, loop_invoice_verification, xor_receive_after_verification, payment])

# Add edges to define the partial order
root.order.add_edge(create_po, xor_receive_before_verification)
root.order.add_edge(xor_receive_before_verification, invoice_verification)
root.order.add_edge(invoice_verification, loop_invoice_verification)
root.order.add_edge(loop_invoice_verification, xor_receive_after_verification)
root.order.add_edge(xor_receive_after_verification, payment)

# Print the POWL model
print(root)
```

This script will create a POWL model for the Purchase-to-Pay process with the following structure:

- Create Purchase Order (Mandatory)
  - Receive Goods (Optional, can be skipped)
    - Invoice Verification (Loop: re-verification is possible)
      - Receive Goods (Optional, can be skipped after invoice verification)
        - Payment (Mandatory)

You can adjust this example to fit the specific requirements of your Purchase-to-Pay process.
