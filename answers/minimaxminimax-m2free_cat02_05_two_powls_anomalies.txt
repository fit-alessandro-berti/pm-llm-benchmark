<think>
We are given two POWL models of the Hire-to-Retire process. The standard process typically includes:

1. Post a job advertisement (Post_Job_Ad)
2. Screen candidates (Screen_Candidates)
3. Conduct interviews (Conduct_Interviews)
4. Make hiring decision (Make_Hiring_Decision)
5. Onboard the new employee (Onboard_Employee)
6. Add to payroll (Add_to_Payroll)
7. Close the case (Close_Case)

We are to analyze the anomalies in each model and decide which one is more normative.

**POWL Model 1:**

The model is defined as a StrictPartialOrder with the following nodes and order:

Nodes: [Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close]

Edges (precedences):
Post -> Screen
Screen -> Decide
Screen -> Interview   [This implies that after Screen, we can have either Decide or Interview? But note: the order is defined as a set of edges, and in a partial order, if there is no direct edge, they can be in parallel. However, in this model, we have:
    Screen -> Decide and Screen -> Interview, but no edge between Decide and Interview. So they can be in parallel?]

Decide -> Onboard
Onboard -> Payroll
Payroll -> Close

But note: the model has an edge from Screen to Decide and from Screen to Interview, meaning that after Screen, we can do either Decide or Interview? And then after Decide, we do Onboard. However, what about Interview? There is no edge from Interview to any of the next steps? This is an anomaly because Interview should lead to Decide.

Looking at the edges:

- Post -> Screen: Post must happen before Screen.
- Screen -> Decide: Screen must happen before Decide.
- Screen -> Interview: Screen must happen before Interview.
- Decide -> Onboard: Decide must happen before Onboard.
- Onboard -> Payroll: Onboard must happen before Payroll.
- Payroll -> Close: Payroll must happen before Close.

But note: there is no edge from Interview to Decide or to any other node? So Interview can be done at any time after Screen and before? Actually, the model does not enforce that Interview must be done before Decide? This is an anomaly because the interview is typically part of the decision-making process and should be completed before making a hiring decision.

Moreover, the model does not enforce that Interview must be done at all? Since it is not connected to the next steps, it might be skipped? But then it is not required? This is also a problem.

Another issue: after Screen, we can do either Decide or Interview? And if we do Decide, we skip Interview? But in a standard process, Interview is a critical step. However, the model does not require Interview to be done before Decide. This is a severe anomaly because the hiring decision should be based on interviews.

**POWL Model 2:**

Nodes: [Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close]

Edges:
Post -> Screen
Post -> Interview   [This implies that Post must happen before Screen and also before Interview? But note: in a partial order, if we have two edges from the same node, the target nodes are both after the source. So both Screen and Interview must occur after Post? And they are independent? So they can be in parallel?]

Interview -> Decide
Decide -> loop_onboarding
loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll
xor_payroll -> Close

Now, let's break down the operators:

- `loop_onboarding` is a loop operator: `OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip])`. This means: 
    We have a loop that must execute Onboard at least once (because it's the first child in the loop structure: `*(Onboard, skip)`). The loop structure is `*(A, B)` meaning: do A, then repeatedly do B followed by A until the loop is exited. Here, A is Onboard and B is skip (which is a silent transition that does nothing). So effectively, we must do Onboard at least once, and then we can exit (by executing skip and then not repeating) or we can do the skip (which does nothing) and then repeat? Actually, the typical meaning of `*(A, B)` is: do A, then repeatedly do B followed by A until the loop condition fails (i.e., we exit by not doing B). But in this case, the second child is skip, which is a silent transition that does nothing. So it means: after doing Onboard, we can either exit the loop (by doing the silent skip and then stopping) or we can do the skip (which does nothing) and then do Onboard again? But note: the model does not specify a condition for exiting. The loop continues until the condition (which is represented by the second child) is taken? But in this case, the second child is skip, which is taken with probability 1? That doesn't make sense.

Actually, the pm4py POWL loop operator is defined as: `*(A, B)` means: 
    - First, A is executed.
    - Then, B is executed. After B, the choice is taken: either exit the loop or do A again followed by B again (and so on).

But in this model, the loop is defined as `OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip])`. This means:
    - Onboard is executed.
    - Then we have a choice: either exit the loop (i.e., do the skip and then break out) or do the skip (which does nothing) and then do Onboard again? 

But note: the skip is a silent transition that does nothing. So effectively, the loop does Onboard once and then can do any number of additional Onboard? But without condition? This is not typical. Typically, a loop would have a condition for exiting. Here, the second child is skip, which is taken with a probability? But the model does not specify. This is an anomaly because the onboarding might be repeated arbitrarily without a condition? Or it might be skipped? But note: the loop requires at least one Onboard. So it must be done at least once? And then optionally repeated? This is acceptable? But the repetition without condition is problematic.

Alternatively, note that the loop operator in POWL is defined such that the second child (skip in this case) is the loop body that is repeated? Actually, the standard definition of `*(A, B)` is: 
    - A is the first step (which must be done) and then we enter a loop that repeats: B followed by A until we exit? But that is not the common interpretation.

In process trees, the loop operator `*(A, B)` means: 
    - First, A is executed.
    - Then, we repeatedly execute the sequence: B, A, until the loop condition is met (i.e., we stop repeating after a B?).

But note: the standard process tree loop operator is `*(A, B)` meaning: 
    - It executes A (the do part) and then repeatedly executes B (the redo part) and then A again until the loop is exited. The loop condition is implicit: we stop the loop after a B and then do not repeat A? Actually, the condition is not explicit.

However, in pm4py, the loop operator is defined as:
    - The first child (A) is the body that is executed at least once and at the end of each iteration.
    - The second child (B) is the condition (which is executed after the body and then we decide whether to exit or repeat).

But in our case, the second child is skip. So after Onboard, we do the skip (which does nothing) and then we are at the decision point: either exit (by not doing the loop again) or do the body again? But the model does not specify the condition. So the loop can be exited arbitrarily? This is acceptable? But note: the loop must be done at least once? So Onboard is required? And then it can be repeated arbitrarily? This is an anomaly because onboarding might be done multiple times without a clear condition? However, in a real process, we might have to update onboarding information? But it is not typical to have an unconditional loop.

Now, the `xor_payroll` is an XOR operator: `OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Payroll, skip])`. This means: we can either do Payroll or skip it? So we might skip the Payroll step? That is an anomaly because adding to payroll is a critical step? We cannot skip it.

Moreover, the model has:

- Edge: Decide -> loop_onboarding: so after the decision, we start the loop for onboarding? Then after the loop, we do the XOR for Payroll? And then to Close.

But note: the loop_onboarding is a node that represents the entire loop. So we must complete the loop (which includes at least one Onboard and possibly more) and then go to the XOR for Payroll? And then to Close.

Also, note the initial edges: 
    - Post -> Screen and Post -> Interview: so Screen and Interview can happen in parallel? And then Interview -> Decide.

But what about Screen? There is no edge from Screen to Interview or to Decide? So Screen can be done at any time after Post? And Interview must be done after Post? And then Interview must be done before Decide? But Screen is not required to be done? This is a problem because screening candidates is a necessary step? Actually, we have the edge Post->Screen, so Screen must be done. But then we have no edge from Screen to the next steps? So after Screen, we can do Interview? Or not? Actually, we have an edge Post->Interview, so Interview must be done? But then we have Interview->Decide? So the flow is:

Post must be done first (since it's the only node without a predecessor).

Then, we must do Screen (because of Post->Screen) and we must do Interview (because of Post->Interview) and they can be in parallel? Then after both Screen and Interview are done? Or only Interview? Because we have Interview->Decide, so Decide must be after Interview? But there is no edge from Screen to Decide? So Screen does not have to be done before Decide? That is an anomaly because the screening step should be done before the decision.

So in model2, the anomalies are:

1. Screening and Interview are independent and can be done in parallel? But typically, screening is done first and then interviews are scheduled. So having them in parallel is not typical.

2. The decision step (Decide) only requires Interview to be completed? It does not require Screen? This is a severe anomaly because the decision should be based on both screening and interviews.

3. The loop for onboarding: it must be done at least once? That's acceptable? But then it can be repeated arbitrarily? This is not typical? We expect onboarding to be done once? So the loop is unnecessary? But the repetition without condition is an anomaly.

4. The payroll step is optional (via XOR) because we can skip it? That is a severe anomaly because adding to payroll is a necessary step.

**Comparison and Judgment:**

Model1 has a severe anomaly: Interview is not required to be done before the decision? And the decision can be made without interviews? This violates the essence of the hiring process.

Model2 has multiple anomalies:

- The screening step (Screen) is not required to be completed before the decision? Actually, in model2, the decision only requires Interview? So if we do Screen and then stop? We can do Interview and then the decision without having done Screen? That is a problem? But note: the model has an edge from Post to Screen, so Screen must be done? Then why is it not connected to the decision? Actually, the model does not require Screen to be done before the decision? Because there is no edge from Screen to any node? So after Screen, we can do nothing? But then we are stuck? Because the next step is the Interview? But there is no edge from Screen to Interview? And Interview is required (because Post->Interview) and then Interview->Decide? So we can do Screen and then Interview and then Decide? But then Screen and Interview are independent? So if we do Screen, then Interview, then Decide? That's acceptable? But the problem is that the decision doesn't require Screen? That is an anomaly? Because the decision should be based on both.

However, note that in model2, the flow is:

Post -> Screen (must be done) and Post -> Interview (must be done) and they can be in parallel? Then after Interview, we do Decide? But Screen is done in parallel? So when we do Interview, we don't require Screen to be done? But Screen is already done? Because it was done in parallel? So when we get to Decide, we have done both Screen and Interview? Is that the case? 

In a partial order, if we have:

Post -> Screen
Post -> Interview

then both Screen and Interview are after Post? They are independent? Then when we do Interview, we don't wait for Screen? But then when we get to Decide (after Interview), we don't require Screen? But Screen is already done? Because it was done in parallel? So in practice, when we get to Decide, both are done? 

But note: the model does not enforce that Screen must be done before Interview? They can be in parallel? So if we do Interview first, then Screen? Then when we get to Decide, we have done Interview? But Screen might not be done? Actually, we are forced to do Screen? Because of the edge from Post? So we must do Screen? So by the time we do Decide, we have done Screen (because it was forced by Post) and Interview (because it was forced by Post and then we did Interview? and then we did Decide)? So in fact, both are done? 

But the anomaly is that the model does not enforce that Screen must be done before Interview? And also, the model does not enforce that the decision must be after Screen? Actually, the decision is after Interview? But Screen is independent? So in the partial order, we can do:

Option 1: 
    Post -> Screen -> Interview -> Decide

Option 2:
    Post -> Interview -> Screen -> Decide? 
    But note: we have Interview->Decide, so we must do Interview before Decide? So we cannot do Screen after Interview? Because Screen must be done? And we have no edge from Interview to Screen? So we can do Screen and Interview in any order? But we must do both before we do Decide? Because the decision requires Interview? And Screen is independent? But we must do both? So in fact, the decision will be after both? 

Wait: we have two independent edges: Post->Screen and Post->Interview. Then we have Interview->Decide. So the precedences are:

- Screen must be after Post.
- Interview must be after Post.
- Decide must be after Interview.

So by the time we get to Decide, we have done Interview? And we have done Screen? Because Screen was done in parallel? Actually, we don't have a fixed order between Screen and Interview? So we might do:

    Post -> Screen -> (then) Interview -> Decide

or

    Post -> Interview -> (then) Screen -> Decide

But note: the decision (Decide) is only after Interview? So if we do Interview first, then we can do Screen after Interview? And then we do Decide? But the model does not have an edge from Interview to Screen? And it does not have an edge from Screen to Decide? So after Interview, we are allowed to do Screen? And then we can do Decide? But note: we have Interview->Decide? So after Interview, we can do Decide? But we are also allowed to do Screen? And then we can do Decide? But in the second case, we are doing Screen after Interview? And then we do Decide? But we have no edge from Screen to Decide? And no edge from Interview to Screen? So we can do:

    Post -> Interview -> Screen -> Decide

That is allowed? Because:

- Post is done.
- Then we do Interview (because it's after Post) and then we do Screen (because it's after Post) and then we do Decide (because it's after Interview? But we have already done Interview? So we are allowed to do Screen after Interview? And then we do Decide?).

But note: we have Interview->Decide? So we can do Decide immediately after Interview? Or we can do other things? In POWL, the partial order only specifies precedences: if there is no edge, we can do them in any order? So we can do:

    Post -> Interview -> Decide   (and skip Screen? but we cannot skip Screen because of Post->Screen? So we must do Screen? So we can do Screen after Interview and before Decide?).

Therefore, the flow might be:

    Post -> Screen -> Interview -> Decide   OR
    Post -> Interview -> Screen -> Decide   OR
    Post -> Screen and Interview in parallel -> then both done -> then Decide? 

But the model does not enforce that Screen must be done before Interview? So the order between Screen and Interview is arbitrary? That is an anomaly because typically, screening is done before interviews.

Additionally, the loop for onboarding and the optional payroll step are anomalies.

**Conclusion:**

Both models have anomalies? But which one is more normative?

Model1 has a severe anomaly: the hiring decision is not enforced to be after the interview? So it can skip the interview? That is a critical deviation.

Model2 has the following anomalies:

- The order between screening and interview is not fixed? (they are in parallel) -> this is not typical? But in practice, sometimes they might overlap? It's less severe? 
- The decision step requires the interview but not the screening? However, in model2, because screening is enforced by the edge from Post? So screening is done? But the model does not require that screening is done before the interview? So the decision is based on the interview? and the screening is done? But they are independent? This is not as severe as model1? 
- The loop for onboarding? It requires at least one onboarding? That's acceptable? But the repetition without condition is an anomaly? However, in a real process, onboarding might be a one-time step? So the loop is unnecessary? But the model does not enforce a condition for repetition? It can loop arbitrarily? This is an anomaly? 
- The payroll step is optional? That is a severe anomaly? Because adding to payroll is mandatory? 

But note: in model2, the payroll step is optional? So it can be skipped? That is a critical deviation? 

Therefore, both models have critical anomalies? But let's compare:

Model1:
- The interview can be skipped? Because it's not connected to the next steps? So after Screen, we can go to Decide without doing Interview? That is a critical anomaly? Because the decision must be based on interviews? 

Model2:
- The payroll step can be skipped? That is also a critical anomaly? Because the employee must be added to payroll? 

But note: in model2, the screening and interview are done? But the order is not fixed? And the decision requires the interview? But not necessarily the screening? However, the screening is done? So the decision is made after both? But the model does not enforce that? But in practice, both are done? 

Actually, the model2 does not enforce that the decision is after the screening? So if we do the interview and then the decision? We might do the screening after the decision? That is a problem? 

So both models have critical flaws? But the flaws are different:

- Model1: critical because the interview can be skipped? 
- Model2: critical because the payroll step can be skipped? and because the order between screening and interview is not fixed? 

But note: the payroll step is critical? And the interview is critical? 

However, model2 also has the loop operator which is problematic? 

Given that both have critical flaws, we must decide which one is more aligned? 

In model2, the steps that are critical (screening, interview, decision, onboarding, payroll, and closing) are all present? But payroll is optional? And the loop for onboarding might be repeated arbitrarily? 

In model1, the steps are all present? But the interview is not enforced? 

Which is more severe? 

- Skipping the interview (model1) is more severe than skipping the payroll? Because without an interview, you might make a bad hiring decision? And then you wouldn't even get to payroll? 

But note: in model1, the model also has the edge Screen->Decide and Screen->Interview? So after Screen, we can do either Decide or Interview? And then if we do Decide, we skip Interview? That is severe? 

In model2, if we skip payroll? We might have a hired employee who is not added to payroll? That is also severe? 

But the task is to decide which model more closely aligns? 

We can consider that model1 has a more structured flow? But with the critical flaw of possibly skipping Interview? 

Model2 has more flaws? But the critical flaw of skipping payroll is in the XOR? However, note that in model2, the payroll step is an XOR with skip? So it can be skipped? But the rest of the flow is more structured? 

But model2 also has the issue of the loop? 

After reevaluation, note that in model2, the loop_onboarding must be done at least once? So onboarding is required? And then we do the XOR for payroll? So we can skip payroll? 

In model1, onboarding and payroll are required? But we skip Interview? 

Which is more acceptable? 

Actually, the interview is a key step? So skipping Interview is more severe? 

Moreover, in model1, the anomaly is that we can skip Interview? 

In model2, we have multiple anomalies? 

But the question is: which model is more normative? 

We must choose one? 

I would argue that model2 is more aligned? Because:

- In model2, the critical steps (screening, interview, decision, onboarding, payroll, closing) are all present? And the onboarding and payroll are at least attempted? 
- The anomalies in model2 are: 
    * The order between screening and interview is not fixed? (they can be in parallel or in any order) -> this is not ideal? But in reality, sometimes interviews are scheduled while screening is ongoing? 
    * The loop for onboarding? It's unnecessary? But at least we do onboarding? 
    * The payroll step can be skipped? -> severe? 

But in model1, we have a more severe anomaly: skipping Interview? 

Therefore, model2 is more aligned? 

But note: model2 has the XOR for payroll? So payroll can be skipped? That is a critical deviation? 

However, the problem says: "some anomalies might be more severe" and we are to judge overall alignment? 

Alternatively, we can note that model1 has the edge from Screen to Decide and Screen to Interview? So it allows to skip Interview? But model2 has the interview as a required step? Because of Post->Interview? and then Interview->Decide? So Interview must be done? 

In model2, Interview must be done? Because of the edge from Post? and then from Interview to Decide? So we must do Interview? 

In model1, we can skip Interview? Because there is no edge from Interview to any node? So after Screen, we can do Decide and skip Interview? 

So model2 forces Interview? 

Therefore, model2 is better? 

But then we have the payroll step? 

In model2, we can skip payroll? 

But the problem is: we must choose one? 

I think model2 is more aligned? Because it forces the interview? And the other steps are present? Even though payroll can be skipped? 

But skipping payroll is a severe anomaly? 

Alternatively, note that in model2, the payroll step is optional? But in model1, we have the payroll step? So model1 does not skip payroll? 

But model1 skips the interview? 

Given that, I would say model1 is worse? 

Final choice: model2 is more aligned? 

But note: the problem says "which model more closely aligns with a normative version"? 

We can say model2? 

But let's see the answers? 

Alternatively, we can note that the loop operator and the XOR operator are also deviations? But they are less severe than skipping a critical step? 

In model1, the interview step is critical? and can be skipped? 

In model2, the payroll step is critical? and can be skipped? 

But note: the hire-to-retire process? The employee must be added to payroll? So that is critical? 

But also, the interview is critical? 

However, without the interview, we might hire without interviewing? That is very bad? 

So I think model1 is worse? 

Therefore, model2 is the better choice? 

**Conclusion:** 

Model2 is more aligned? 

But we must justify? 

Model2 has the following advantages over model1:

- Model2 enforces the interview step? (because it is required by the edge from Post and then to Decide) 
- Model2 has the onboarding step? (which is required by the loop) 
- Model2 has the payroll step? (though it can be skipped? but at least it is present? and we have an edge for it) 

Whereas model1 allows skipping the interview? 

So the critical anomaly of skipping Interview in model1 is more severe than the anomaly of skipping payroll in model2? 

Therefore, model2 is more aligned? 

But note: model2 has the parallel order between screening and interview? and the loop? and the XOR for payroll? 

These are also anomalies? 

But overall, model2 is more structured? 

So we choose model2? 

**Final Answer:** Model2 is more normative?

### Analysis of POWL Models for Hire-to-Retire Process

#### **Standard Hire-to-Retire Sequence**  
A normative process typically follows this logical order:  
1. **Post_Job_Ad** (advertise the job).  
2. **Screen_Candidates** (filter applications).  
3. **Conduct_Interviews** (evaluate shortlisted candidates).  
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision** (select candidate).  
5. **Onboard_Employee** (integrate new hire).  
6. **Add_to_Payroll** (register employee in payroll).  
7. **Close_Case** (finalize the process).  

Key constraints:  
- **Screening must precede interviews** to inform interview decisions.  
- **Decision-making must follow interviews** to ensure candidates are evaluated.  
- **Onboarding and payroll addition are mandatory** for a valid hire.  
- Activities like **advertising, screening, and decision** cannot be skipped.  

---

#### **Anomalies in POWL Model 1**  
```python
model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)   #  Issue 1: Decision allowed without interview
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview) #  Issue 2: No link from Interview to later steps
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```  
**Identified Anomalies**:  
1. **Critical Omission of Interview**  
   - `Screen  Decide` allows making a hiring decision **without interviewing candidates**.  
   - `Interview` is not connected to any subsequent steps, making it optional.  
   - **Severity**: *Severe* – Violates core hiring logic (decision must be interview-informed).  
2. **Irrelevant Parallelism**  
   - `Screen  Interview` implies Screen and Interview could occur in parallel.  
   - **Severity**: *Moderate* – Interviews typically require prior screening results.  
3. **Missing Mandatory Steps**  
   - None. All steps (advertising, screening, onboarding, payroll) are explicitly connected.  

**Process Flow Impact**:  
- Allows skipping critical interviews, risking unqualified hires.  
- Breaks the dependency between screening  interviews  decision.  

---

#### **Anomalies in POWL Model 2**  
```python
loop_onboarding = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip])
xor_payroll = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Payroll, skip])
model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close])
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview) #  Issue 1: Parallel to Screen
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```  
**Identified Anomalies**:  
1. **Uncontrolled Loop for Onboarding**  
   - `loop_onboarding` (`*(Onboard, skip)`) allows **unbounded repetition** of onboarding.  
   - **Severity**: *Moderate* – Onboarding should occur once; excessive repeats are illogical.  
2. **XOR Operator Allows Skipping Payroll**  
   - `xor_payroll` enables **skipping `Add_to_Payroll`** (via `skip`).  
   - **Severity**: *Severe* – Payroll addition is mandatory for any hired employee.  
3. **Parallel Advertising, Screening, and Interviews**  
   - `Post  Screen` and `Post  Interview` allow these steps to run concurrently.  
   - **Severity**: *Moderate* – Interviews depend on screening results; parallelism is atypical.  
4. **No Enforcement of Screening  Interview**  
   - No direct edge between `Screen` and `Interview`.  
   - **Severity**: *Moderate* – Interviews can start before screening, disrupting candidate evaluation.  

**Process Flow Impact**:  
- Skipping payroll breaks compliance (employees not paid).  
- Repetitive onboarding may indicate workflow errors.

#### **Comparative Evaluation**  
| **Aspect**                | **Model 1**                              | **Model 2**                              |  
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| **Interview Dependency**  |  Decision skips interview               |  Interview required before decision    |  
| **Mandatory Steps**       |  All steps are enforced                 |  Payroll can be skipped (XOR)          |  
| **Onboarding Logic**      |  One-time onboarding                    |  Unbounded loop                         |  
| **Screening/Interview**   |  Parallelism possible                   |  Parallelism with no enforced order    |  
| **Payroll**               |  Mandatory                              |  Can be skipped                        |  

**Critical Flaws**:  
- **Model 1** permits **skipping interviews**  high risk of bad hires.  
- **Model 2** permits **skipping payroll**  violates legal/accounting compliance.  

**Less Severe Issues**:  
- Both models allow **unnecessary parallelism** between screening and interviews.  
- Model 2’s **loop operator** for onboarding is redundant.  

---

### **Verdict: Model 2 is More Normative**  
**Justification**:  
1. **Preserves Core Hiring Logic**:  
   - Enforces `Interview  Decide`, ensuring decisions are interview-informed.  
   - Model 1 breaks this dependency (`Screen  Decide` bypasses interviews).  
2. **Mandatory Steps**:  
   - Model 2 mandates `Interview` and `Onboard` (though payroll is skippable).  
   - Model 1 lacks any enforcement of critical steps (only payroll/onboarding are "hardwired").  
3. **Severity of Anomalies**:  
   - Skipping payroll (Model 2) is less catastrophic than skipping interviews (Model 1).  
   - Interview errors lead to unqualified hires; payroll errors are operational but detectable later.  

**Why Model 2 Wins**:  
- Model 1 fundamentally **violates hiring best practices** by allowing decisions without interviews.  
- Model 2’s flaws (e.g., skippable payroll, repetitive onboarding) are **operational issues** that can be fixed without breaking core logic.  

### **Conclusion**  
Model 2 aligns more closely with the normative Hire-to-Retire process. While both models have anomalies, **Model 1’s omission of the interview before the hiring decision is a more severe deviation** than Model 2’s optional payroll or unbounded onboarding loop. Model 2’s structure, despite its flaws, maintains essential hiring workflow dependencies.
