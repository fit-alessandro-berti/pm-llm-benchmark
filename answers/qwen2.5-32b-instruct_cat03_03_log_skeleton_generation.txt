To construct the Log Skeleton for the described order fulfillment process, we first need to define the relationships and constraints among the activities based on the provided information. Here is a plausible set of constraints for the scenario:

1. **Equivalence**: No activities are listed as equivalent.
2. **Always Before**: 
   - `RO` must occur before `CA`, since an order must be received before checking its availability.
   - `CA` must occur before `RI`, as items need to be available to be reserved.
   - `RI` must occur before `PI`, as items need to be reserved before picking.
   - `PI` must occur before `QC`, as items need to be picked to undergo quality checks.
   - `QC` must occur before `PO`, as items must pass quality checks before being packed.
   - `PO` must occur before `GSL`, as the order must be packed before a shipping label can be generated.
   - `GSL` must occur before `D`, as the shipping label must be attached before dispatching.
   - `RO` must occur before `IC`, as the order must be received before an invoice can be sent.
3. **Always After**: 
   - `IC` must be followed by `RP`, as a record of payment must be updated after invoicing.
4. **Never Together**: 
   - No activities are listed to never co-exist.
5. **Activity Occurrences**:
   - Each activity should occur exactly once per order, except for `RP` which might occur once for each payment received (implied to be one in this scenario). Thus, `RP` can occur 0 or 1 time.
6. **Directly-Follows Constraints**: 
   - `RO` must be directly followed by `CA`.
   - `CA` must be directly followed by `RI`.
   - `RI` must be directly followed by `PI`.
   - `PI` must be directly followed by `QC`.
   - `QC` must be directly followed by `PO`.
   - `PO` must be directly followed by `GSL`.
   - `GSL` must be directly followed by `D`.
   - `RO` must be directly followed by `IC` (since invoicing can happen independently of the physical process).
   - `IC` must be directly followed by `RP`.

Here is the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No equivalence constraints
    'always_before': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), 
        ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('RO', 'IC')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },
    'never_together': set(),  # No never together constraints
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1}, 'CA': {1}, 'RI': {1}, 'PI': {1}, 
        'QC': {1}, 'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1}, 'D': {1}, 
        'IC': {1}, 'RP': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), 
        ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('RO', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
```

This dictionary specifies the constraints between the activities in the order fulfillment process, ensuring that the sequence and dependencies are correctly represented.
