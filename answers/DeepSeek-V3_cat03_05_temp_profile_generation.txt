Here is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process. The dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs, with estimated average times and standard deviations based on typical supply chain operations:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 7200),  # Average: 1 day, Std Dev: 2 hours
    # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),  # Average: 1 week, Std Dev: 1 day
    # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('RC', 'QI'): (14400, 3600),  # Average: 4 hours, Std Dev: 1 hour
    # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('QI', 'CA'): (28800, 7200),  # Average: 8 hours, Std Dev: 2 hours
    # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('CA', 'PT'): (43200, 10800),  # Average: 12 hours, Std Dev: 3 hours
    # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PT', 'PK'): (14400, 3600),  # Average: 4 hours, Std Dev: 1 hour
    # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 1800),  # Average: 2 hours, Std Dev: 30 minutes
    # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, Std Dev: 4 hours
    # Distribution to After-Sales Support
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 432000),  # Average: 30 days, Std Dev: 5 days
    # Supplier Selection to Receive Components
    ('SS', 'RC'): (691200, 86400),  # Average: 8 days, Std Dev: 1 day
    # Order Placement to Quality Inspection
    ('OP', 'QI'): (619200, 86400),  # Average: 7.2 days, Std Dev: 1 day
    # Receive Components to Product Testing
    ('RC', 'PT'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, Std Dev: 4 hours
    # Quality Inspection to Packaging
    ('QI', 'PK'): (72000, 14400),  # Average: 20 hours, Std Dev: 4 hours
    # Component Assembly to Distribution
    ('CA', 'DT'): (172800, 28800),  # Average: 2 days, Std Dev: 8 hours
    # Product Testing to After-Sales Support
    ('PT', 'AS'): (2595600, 432000),  # Average: 30.1 days, Std Dev: 5 days
    # Supplier Selection to Product Testing
    ('SS', 'PT'): (777600, 86400),  # Average: 9 days, Std Dev: 1 day
    # Order Placement to Packaging
    ('OP', 'PK'): (648000, 86400),  # Average: 7.5 days, Std Dev: 1 day
    # Receive Components to After-Sales Support
    ('RC', 'AS'): (2678400, 432000),  # Average: 31 days, Std Dev: 5 days
    # Quality Inspection to Distribution
    ('QI', 'DT'): (172800, 28800),  # Average: 2 days, Std Dev: 8 hours
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Directly Connected Pairs**: These represent sequential steps in the process, such as `('SS', 'OP')` (Supplier Selection to Order Placement) or `('PT', 'PK')` (Product Testing to Packaging). The average times and standard deviations are based on typical operational delays.
2. **Non-Sequential Pairs**: These represent activities that are not directly connected but may eventually follow each other in the process, such as `('SS', 'PT')` (Supplier Selection to Product Testing) or `('OP', 'PK')` (Order Placement to Packaging). The times are cumulative estimates of the intermediate steps.
3. **Complexity**: The dictionary includes pairs separated by multiple steps to reflect the complexity of the global supply chain process.

This temporal profile can be used to monitor deviations in the process and identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
