To identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the given event log, analyze the data, hypothesize potential causes, and propose SQL queries for further investigation, let's proceed step-by-step:

### 1. Identifying Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

#### Case 1001:
- **Normal process flow observed**: No anomalies detected.

#### Case 1002:
- **Anomaly**: The sequence of activities is out of order. Specifically, 'Confirm Shipment' and 'Ship Goods' occur before 'Perform Credit Check' and 'Validate Stock'.
- **Undesirable Behavior**: This could indicate a violation of standard operating procedures or a system error allowing out-of-sequence actions.

#### Case 1003:
- **Anomaly**: 'Ship Goods' occurs before 'Confirm Shipment'.
- **Undesirable Behavior**: This suggests a potential issue with the order processing system or a lack of adherence to protocol.

#### Case 1004:
- **Anomaly**: 'Receive Payment' occurs before 'Issue Invoice'.
- **Undesirable Behavior**: This is a significant deviation from the expected process flow and could indicate a major policy violation or system error.

### 2. Hypothesizing Causes

#### Case 1002:
- **Hypothesis**: System error or user error allowing out-of-sequence actions. Possible lack of proper validation in the workflow system.

#### Case 1003:
- **Hypothesis**: Training issue or system error. Employees might not be following the correct sequence, or the system might not be enforcing the correct order of operations.

#### Case 1004:
- **Hypothesis**: Major policy violation or system error. It's possible that payments are being processed incorrectly or that there's a flaw in the system allowing payments before invoices are issued.

### 3. Proposing SQL Queries for Further Investigation

#### Query to identify cases with out-of-sequence activities (Case 1002 and 1003):

```sql
WITH ranked_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        event_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS event_order,
        CASE 
            WHEN activity = 'Register Order' THEN 1
            WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 2
            WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 3
            WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 4
            WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 5
            WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 6
            WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 7
            ELSE 0
        END AS expected_order
    FROM 
        order_event_log
)
SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity || ' (' || event_order || ')', ' -> ' ORDER BY event_order) AS actual_sequence,
    STRING_AGG(activity || ' (' || expected_order || ')', ' -> ' ORDER BY expected_order) AS expected_sequence
FROM 
    ranked_events
GROUP BY 
    case_id
HAVING 
    STRING_AGG(activity || ' (' || event_order || ')', ' -> ' ORDER BY event_order) != 
    STRING_AGG(activity || ' (' || expected_order || ')', ' -> ' ORDER BY expected_order);
```

#### Query to find cases where 'Ship Goods' occurs before 'Confirm Shipment' (Case 1003):

```sql
SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity || ' (' || timestamp || ')', ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS event_sequence
FROM 
    order_event_log
WHERE 
    case_id IN (
        SELECT 
            case_id
        FROM 
            order_event_log
        WHERE 
            activity = 'Ship Goods'
        INTERSECT
        SELECT 
            case_id
        FROM 
            order_event_log
        WHERE 
            activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    )
GROUP BY 
    case_id
HAVING 
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) < 
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END);
```

#### Query to identify cases where 'Receive Payment' occurs before 'Issue Invoice' (Case 1004):

```sql
SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity || ' (' || timestamp || ')', ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS event_sequence
FROM 
    order_event_log
WHERE 
    case_id IN (
        SELECT 
            case_id
        FROM 
            order_event_log
        WHERE 
            activity = 'Receive Payment'
        INTERSECT
        SELECT 
            case_id
        FROM 
            order_event_log
        WHERE 
            activity = 'Issue Invoice'
    )
GROUP BY 
    case_id
HAVING 
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) < 
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END);
```

#### Query to investigate resource behavior and potential training issues:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.resource_id,
    r.role,
    r.department,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND oel.timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log oel2 WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment') THEN oel.case_id END) AS ship_before_confirm_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND oel.timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log oel2 WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice') THEN oel.case_id END) AS payment_before_invoice_count
FROM 
    resources r
LEFT JOIN 
    order_event_log oel ON r.resource_id = oel.resource
GROUP BY 
    r.resource_id, r.role, r.department
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND oel.timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log oel2 WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment') THEN oel.case_id END) > 0 OR
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND oel.timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM order_event_log oel2 WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice') THEN oel.case_id END) > 0;
```

These queries will help in identifying and investigating the anomalies and undesirable behaviors observed in the event log, allowing for a deeper understanding of the issues and potential causes.
