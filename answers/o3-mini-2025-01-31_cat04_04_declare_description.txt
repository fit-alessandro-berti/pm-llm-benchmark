Below is an explanation of how the DECLARE model “drives” a loan application process and the rationale behind its many constraints.

1. Starting the process – Initiation and Mandatory Application Receipt  
• The process is kicked off by the customer’s submission of their loan application. This is reflected by the init constraint on Receive_Application and an existence obligation that requires a Receive_Application event. In other words, no matter what happens later, the process must begin with an application being received.  
• In practice, this might be an online form or paper application being logged into the system.

2. Assessing the Applicant – The Preliminary Credit Check  
• The model specifies Preliminary_Credit_Check with an exactly_one constraint. This means that for every application, exactly one preliminary credit check must be performed.  
• A response constraint “Receive_Application  Preliminary_Credit_Check” enforces that once the application is received, a credit check must follow. This ordering is crucial in real life because verifying creditworthiness early on limits exposure to risk and fraud.

3. Collecting Supporting Information – Gathering Additional Documents  
• After the credit check, the process calls for gathering additional documents. A succession constraint “Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents” ensures that these documents (such as pay stubs or identification) are collected after confirming basic creditworthiness.  
• Additionally, a coexistence constraint links Gather_Additional_Documents with Authorize_Contract_Terms. This means that if the documents are collected, the approval of contract terms (later on) should also occur. This relationship ensures that the additional documents and final contract approvals “travel together” to maintain legal and regulatory completeness.

4. Quality and Compliance – Quality Assurance and Loan Packaging  
• Once the needed documents have been gathered, further quality and compliance checks kick in. An altsuccession constraint “Gather_Additional_Documents  Quality_Assurance_Review” ensures that – following document collection – a quality assurance review takes place to verify that everything is in order.  
• The constraint “responded_existence” on Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package – where the quality assurance review is mandated to follow the assembly of the package – reinforces that the loan offer package (which details terms and conditions) is only considered acceptable after internal verification.
• A chain succession constraint “Quality_Assurance_Review  Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package” sets the stage for tightly coupling these two steps so that any error or oversight gets caught immediately before assembling the final offer.

5. Formal Approval – Authorization of Contract Terms  
• Authorize_Contract_Terms must come after quality checks. The precedence constraint “Quality_Assurance_Review  Authorize_Contract_Terms” makes sure that the quality check happens first. Additionally, a chain precedence “Authorize_Contract_Terms  Preliminary_Credit_Check” reinforces that the applicant’s credit has been checked long before formal loan terms are authorized.  
• This ordering is rooted in real-world motivations: before spending more resources on finalizing a contract, an organization must ensure that all due diligence (such as regulatory compliance and risk management) has been met.

6. Closing the Deal – Disbursement and Notification  
• The chain response “Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Transfer_Funds” connects the assembly of the loan offer directly to disbursement, emphasizing that funds should be transferred only when the offer package is fully prepared and vetted.  
• Alternative response and precedence constraints (altresponse and altprecedence) between Transfer_Funds and Notify_Customer set up a situation where if funds are disbursed, then the customer must be notified (and vice versa). These symmetric rules guarantee that final communication to the customer is inseparable from the actual disbursement of funds.
• This clear linkage is vital in practice to ensure that customers are kept fully informed—improving satisfaction and helping avoid disputes or misunderstandings.

7. Forbidden and Prohibitive Rules  
• The absence constraint on Proceed_Without_Compliance ensures that no step bypasses the necessary compliance protocols. If any process instance attempts to “proceed without compliance,” it would be flagged as a violation, protecting the institution from potential legal and regulatory risks.
• Similarly, constraints like noncoexistence, nonsuccession, and nonchainsuccession (for example, preventing Transfer_Funds from occurring together with Receive_Application or stopping Notify_Customer from directly following Preliminary_Credit_Check) are designed to avoid illogical or unsafe ordering. For instance, transferring funds before a proper credit check or quality assurance review would expose the organization to fraud, risk, and regulatory noncompliance.

8. Real-world Motivations and Consequences of Deviations  
• Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management: Every constraint is in place to ensure that no step is skipped or executed out of order. Skipping the preliminary credit check, for example, might mean approving risky loans, which opens the door to defaults and potential legal issues.  
• Fraud Prevention: A strict order—from application receipt to document gathering and quality review—helps detect inconsistencies or fraudulent data early in the process.  
• Operational Best Practices: Clear separations between steps, such as disbursement only after assembling and reviewing a loan offer package, ensure a process that is auditable and maintainable.  
• Customer Satisfaction: Ensuring that funds are disbursed only after thorough checks means customers are less likely to struggle with unforeseen issues later on. Moreover, the enforced link between funds transfer and customer notification keeps communication clear.
• Consequences of Out-of-Order Actions: If, for example, Transfer_Funds were to occur before completing the quality assurance review or without an authorized contract, the organization might face severe financial risk. Similarly, skipping steps like Gather_Additional_Documents could lead to an incomplete assessment of the applicant’s risk profile, undermining both the institution’s risk management efforts and regulatory adherence, and potentially resulting in costly remediation or reputational damage.

In summary, the DECLARE model not only prescribes a strict sequence of events—from receiving an application, performing a credit check, gathering documents, executing quality reviews, authorizing terms, to transferring funds and notifying the customer—but it also embeds practical, real-world requirements for regulatory compliance, risk management, fraud prevention, and customer-centric communication. Each constraint works together to ensure that every loan application unfolds in a safe, logical, and verifiable manner, and any deviation from this order could jeopardize both the financial institution’s operational integrity and its external obligations.
