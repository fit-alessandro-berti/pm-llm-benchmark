 Process cubes are an innovative approach to multi-dimensional process mining, which is an extension of traditional process mining. They enable the analysis of business processes from various perspectives and provide a more holistic understanding of process behavior.

Traditional process mining techniques focus on discovering, analyzing, and improving a single, linear process instance at a time. These techniques take an event log as input, which is a collection of events relevant to a specific process, and generate a process model as output. By analyzing the process flow, conformance, time, or predictive aspects, traditional process mining methods can unveil bottlenecks and inefficiencies, enabling optimization and enhancing compliance with process guidelines.

Process cubes, on the other hand, integrate process mining methods with ideas adopted from OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) to enable multi-dimensional analysis. In a process cube, data is structured and aggregated along several dimensions (such as time, location, product, or organization), and views on the data can be configured by selecting the desired dimensions. This approach allows analysts to slice, dice, and drill down through the multi-dimensional data, exploring the process from various perspectives and investigating its different aspects.

One of the main benefits of process cubes is their ability to handle large and complex process data. When dealing with large numbers of process instances, categorized along several dimensions, a multi-dimensional analysis often proves to be faster and more insightful than a traditional single-dimensional approach. Furthermore, it enables discovering patterns, trends, and relationships that may be overlooked in traditional process mining.

In summary, while traditional process mining techniques focus on understanding a single aspect, process cubes and multi-dimensional process mining offer a more comprehensive and flexible analysis of processes by integrating various dimensions. This approach allows analysts to uncover deeper insights and make more informed decisions about process optimization and improvement.
