**Case Identification and Analysis**

To identify cases with performance issues, we will focus on those with significantly longer lead times. We will assume that a lead time of 60 hours or more is considered "significantly longer."

1. Cases with lead times of 60 hours or more:
	* 2003 (all cases)
	* 2005 (all cases)
2. Analyzing attributes to determine potential root causes:
	* Resource:
		+ CSR_Jane: All cases for this resource have longer lead times.
		+ Adjuster_Mike: Cases for this resource often involve multiple requests for additional documents, contributing to extended lead times.
		+ Finance_Alan: All cases for this resource have longer lead times.
		+ Manager_Ann, Manager_Bill, Manager_Paul: These resources only have cases with relatively short lead times.
	* Region:
		+ Cases from Region A (2001, 2003, 2004, 2005) often have longer lead times compared to Region B.
		+ Cases from Region B (2002, 2004, 2005) generally have shorter lead times.
	* Complexity:
		+ High-complexity claims (2003, 2005) often require multiple requests for additional documents, leading to extended lead times.

**Proposed Explanations and Mitigation Suggestions**

1. Resource:
	* Assign resources more efficiently to reduce the likelihood of overloading and decreased productivity.
	* Consider redistributing resources to regions with more significant lead time differences.
2. Region:
	* Investigate the causes of differences in lead times between regions A and B. Are there any systemic issues or biases in the process that contribute to these disparities?
	* Consider implementing more region-agnostic processes or training to reduce regional differences in productivity.
3. Complexity:
	* Implement a more efficient document-review process for high-complexity claims to reduce the number of requests for additional documentation.
	* Consider offering alternative approaches or simplified solutions for high-complexity claims to reduce the overall lead time.

**Root Cause Decomposition**

Based on the analysis, we can decompose the root causes into the following categories:

1. Resource allocation and efficiency
2. Regional differences in productivity
3. Complexity-related issues in document review and processing

To address these root causes, we can implement process improvements, such as:

1. Resource reallocation and retraining
2. Regional standardization and quality control
3. Streamlining document review processes for high-complexity claims
4. Providing alternative solutions or simplified approaches for high-complexity claims

**Case-Specific Recommendations**

For each case with a significantly longer lead time, we can provide specific recommendations based on the root causes identified:

1. 2003:
	* Adjuster_Mike: Reconsider resource allocation to reduce the number of cases handled by this resource.
	* Finance_Alan: Investigate the reasons for extended lead times in cases handled by this resource.
2. 2005:
	* CSR_Paul: Consider redistributing cases to other resources to reduce the likelihood of overloading.
	* Adjuster_Lisa: Streamline the document-review process to reduce the number of requests for additional documentation.

By addressing these root causes and implementing process improvements, we can reduce lead times and improve the overall performance of the "Insurance Claims Processing" process.
