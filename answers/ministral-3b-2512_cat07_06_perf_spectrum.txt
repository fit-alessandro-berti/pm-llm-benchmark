This visualization is a Sankey diagram illustrating the progression and flow of fines over time from one state to another within a library system.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Structure and Axes:**
   - The diagram has three horizontal bands representing different stages in the lifecycle of fines.
   - The leftmost band (2000-01-25 01:00:00) seems to be the initial state where fines are created or identified.
   - The middle band (2006-09-09 02:00:00) represents the stage where fine notifications are inserted.
   - The rightmost band (2013-04-24 02:00:00) indicates the final stage where fines are sent for credit collection.

2. **Flows:**
   - From the initial state, the majority of the fines flow directly upwards to the "Send Fine" node, which then transitions to the "Insert Fine Notification" stage.
   - The "Insert Fine Notification" stage shows a significant number of flows transitioning to the final stage, "Send for Credit Collection".

3. **Color Coding:**
   - The flows are color-coded, with darker shades indicating more significant or frequent transitions at each stage. The lighter shades represent less frequent transitions.

4. **Transitions:**
   - The diagram shows that most fines are processed through the notification stage before being sent for credit collection, indicating a sequential workflow.
   - There are fewer transitions directly from the initial state to the credit collection stage, suggesting that most fines go through the notification process first.

In summary, the Sankey diagram effectively visualizes the lifecycle of fines from their initial identification to credit collection, emphasizing the importance of the notification step in the process. The flow lines and color intensity provide a clear depiction of how fines move through the system over time.
