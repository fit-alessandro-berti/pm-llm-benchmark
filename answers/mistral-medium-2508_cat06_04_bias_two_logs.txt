### **Analysis of Bias in Event Logs: Group A (Protected) vs. Group B (Unprotected)**

The event logs reveal **systematic bias** in favor of **Group B (Unprotected Group)** due to the influence of the **`LocalResident`** and **`CommunityGroup`** attributes, which lead to **score adjustments** that are **not applied to Group A (Protected Group)**. Below is a detailed breakdown of how this bias manifests:

---

### **1. Key Observations**
#### **(a) Score Adjustments Only Apply to Group B**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - No applicants receive a **`ScoreAdjustment`** (always `0` or `N/A`).
  - The **`PreliminaryScore`** is the **final score** used in the decision.
  - **Example:**
    - **P001** (Score: 720)  **Approved**
    - **P002** (Score: 710)  **Rejected** (same as U002, but U002 has no adjustment)
    - **P003** (Score: 740)  **Approved**

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - Some applicants receive a **+10 "Community Boost"** if they belong to the **`Highland Civic Darts Club`**.
  - This **artificially inflates their score**, increasing their chances of approval.
  - **Example:**
    - **U001** (Original: 720  Adjusted: **730**)  **Approved**
    - **U003** (Original: 695  Adjusted: **705**)  **Approved** (would likely be rejected without the boost)

#### **(b) LocalResident Status Correlates with Score Adjustments**
- All **Group B** applicants are **`LocalResident = TRUE`**, while **Group A** applicants are **`LocalResident = FALSE`**.
- The **`CommunityGroup`** attribute is **only populated for Group B**, and when present, it triggers a **+10 adjustment**.
- This suggests that **local residency + community membership** is being **rewarded**, while **non-local applicants (Group A) receive no such benefit**.

#### **(c) Decision Disparities Due to Adjustments**
| CaseID | Group  | Original Score | Adjusted Score | Decision  | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| P002   | A      | 710            | 710             | **Rejected** | No adjustment |
| U002   | B      | 710            | 710             | **Rejected** | No community group  no boost |
| U003   | B      | 695            | **705**         | **Approved** | **+10 boost** due to community group |
| P001   | A      | 720            | 720             | Approved  | No adjustment |
| U001   | B      | 720            | **730**         | Approved  | **+10 boost** (higher margin) |

- **U003 (Group B)** is **approved with a 705 adjusted score**, while **P002 (Group A)** is **rejected with a 710 score**—despite having a **higher original score**.
- This shows that **Group B applicants can be approved with lower original scores** due to the **unfair advantage of score adjustments**.

---

### **2. How Bias Manifests**
#### **(a) Structural Bias in Scoring**
- The system **systematically favors Group B** by:
  - **Only applying score adjustments to Group B** (via `CommunityGroup`).
  - **Not providing any compensatory adjustments to Group A**, even if they have similar or better original scores.
- This creates a **two-tiered scoring system** where **Group B applicants can qualify with lower original scores**.

#### **(b) Indirect Discrimination via Proxy Attributes**
- **`LocalResident`** and **`CommunityGroup`** act as **proxy attributes** that disadvantage **Group A**.
  - If **Group A is predominantly non-local**, they are **excluded from score boosts**.
  - If **Group B has exclusive access to certain community groups**, this **further amplifies the bias**.

#### **(c) Decision-Making Inconsistency**
- The **same original score (710)** leads to:
  - **Rejection for Group A (P002)**
  - **Rejection for Group B (U002)** if no community boost
  - **Approval for Group B (U003)** if a **+10 boost** is applied
- This **inconsistency** suggests that **Group B has an unfair advantage** in borderline cases.

### **3. Conclusion: Which Log Exhibits Bias?**
**The bias is embedded in the process applied to Group B (Unprotected Group).**
- **Group A (Protected Group)** is **treated neutrally** (no adjustments, decisions based purely on `PreliminaryScore`).
- **Group B (Unprotected Group)** receives **preferential treatment** via **`ScoreAdjustment`**, which **artificially improves their approval chances**.

This is a classic case of **algorithmic bias**, where **certain groups benefit from hidden advantages** (community boosts) while others do not. The system **favors local residents with community ties**, likely **disproportionately benefiting Group B** while **putting Group A at a disadvantage**.

---
### **4. Recommendations to Mitigate Bias**
1. **Remove or Standardize Score Adjustments**
   - Either **eliminate the `CommunityBoost`** or **apply it uniformly** to all applicants (regardless of group).
2. **Audit Proxy Attributes**
   - Investigate whether **`LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup`** correlate with protected characteristics (e.g., race, nationality).
3. **Transparency in Scoring**
   - Clearly document **why adjustments are applied** and ensure they do not **systematically favor one group**.
4. **Fairness-Aware Model Testing**
   - Use **fairness metrics** (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity) to detect and correct biases.

---
### **Final Answer**
**The event log for Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias** because it **applies score adjustments (`+10 Community Boost`) exclusively to Group B applicants**, leading to **higher approval rates for Group B even when their original scores are lower than Group A’s**. This creates a **systematic advantage** for Group B, while Group A is **denied equivalent opportunities for score enhancement**, resulting in **unfair decision disparities**.
