Looking at these two event logs, **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias** that favors local residents through a community-based scoring adjustment system.

## How the Bias Manifests:

### 1. **Structural Advantage Through Community Bonus**
- Members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a **+10 score adjustment**
- This bonus is only available to those with `LocalResident = TRUE`
- Group A members (all non-local residents) cannot access this benefit by design

### 2. **Impact on Decision Outcomes**
The bias becomes most apparent when comparing similar cases:

**Critical Comparison:**
- **P002 (Group A)**: Score 710  **Rejected**
- **U003 (Group B)**: Score 695 + 10 adjustment = 705  **Approved**

Despite U003 having a **lower base score** (695 vs 710), they were approved while P002 was rejected. The community bonus allowed U003 to bypass what appears to be a ~720 approval threshold.

### 3. **Systematic Discrimination Pattern**
- **100% of Group A** members must meet the approval threshold purely on their preliminary score
- **Group B members** have two pathways to approval:
  1. Meet the threshold directly (like U002)
  2. Use community membership to boost a sub-threshold score (like U003)

### 4. **Equal Treatment vs Equal Opportunity**
While the scoring algorithm may apply the same rules to everyone, the **opportunity to benefit** from community involvement is restricted to local residents. This creates a systematic disadvantage for non-local applicants who cannot compensate for marginal scores through community participation.

This represents **indirect discrimination** where a seemingly neutral policy (rewarding community involvement) disproportionately benefits one group while systematically excluding another based on their residential status.
