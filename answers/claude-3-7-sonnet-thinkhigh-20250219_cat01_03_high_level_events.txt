# Grouping Manufacturing Process Events into High-Level Steps

After analyzing the event log, I've identified three distinct high-level manufacturing process steps that represent logical groupings of the low-level events.

## 1. Material Preparation

**Events included:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
- These events all occur within the first minute of the process
- They collectively represent the preparatory phase before actual manufacturing
- They involve related resources working sequentially (Operator A  Robot Arm  Heating Unit)
- The logical flow progresses from material selection  verification  positioning  preparation
- All activities prepare the raw material to be in the proper condition for subsequent processing

## 2. Welding Operation

**Events included:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale:**
- These events represent the core transformation activities
- They're primarily performed by a single resource (Operator B)
- The events follow a clear operational sequence (tool preparation  multiple welding actions)
- The measurement immediately follows welding, suggesting it's part of the same operational phase
- Timing shows these events occur in quick succession with interdependencies

## 3. Surface Treatment and Quality Control

**Events included:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
- These events represent the final stage of the manufacturing process
- They focus on product finishing and verification
- The activities follow a logical sequence (apply coating  cure coating  verify quality)
- Different specialized resources are involved for each specific finishing function
- These steps create the final product condition and verify its acceptability

## Observations

The event log shows a consistent pattern across different cases (A1 and B2), indicating a standardized manufacturing process. The grouping reflects not only temporal proximity but also functional relationships between activities.

This higher-level view provides several benefits:
- Simplifies process understanding (3 major steps vs. 12 detailed events)
- Highlights the logical workflow phases
- Makes it easier to identify bottlenecks or improvement opportunities at the process stage level
- Provides a framework for monitoring overall manufacturing performance by stage

Each higher-level activity represents a distinct phase with its own objectives, resources, and completion criteria, making the manufacturing process more intuitive to understand and analyze.
