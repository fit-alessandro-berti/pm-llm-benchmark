<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to write a DuckDB SQL query that filters out certain cases based on specific activity sequences and timing conditions. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the main task is to find cases that have the exact sequence of three activities in order: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order'. And then, among those cases, we need to exclude those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. But wait, the third condition says to exclude the cases that meet both the sequence and the timing condition. So, the final result should be all events except those that are in such cases.

Let me think about how to approach this. The first thing is to identify cases that have the exact sequence. That means we need to find cases where the activity column has these three activities in order, with no other events in between. So, perhaps using a window function to check for consecutive occurrences.

But how to check for consecutive events? Maybe using a common table expression (CTE) to find all occurrences of the three activities in sequence. For example, we can use a subquery that finds all the events in the case, then check if the next event is the next in the sequence.

Alternatively, using a window function to track the sequence. For instance, for each case, we can check if the next activity is the next in the sequence. But since the sequence is fixed, maybe we can use a pattern matching approach.

Wait, maybe using a CTE that groups by case_id and then checks for the presence of the three activities in order. For example, for each case, we can check if the activity sequence exists. But how to handle that?

Another approach: For each case, we can list all the events in order. Then, for each case, check if the sequence of three activities is present in order. So, for example, for a case_id, we can check if there are three consecutive events where the first is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the second is 'Create Order', and the third is 'Confirm Order'.

But how to do that in SQL? Maybe using a CASE statement or a window function to check for consecutive rows.

Alternatively, using a subquery that finds all the events in the case, then checking for the sequence. For example, for each case, we can check if the sequence exists by looking for the three activities in order.

Let me think. Let's first create a CTE that includes all the events grouped by case_id. Then, for each case, we can check if the three activities are present in order. For that, perhaps we can use a window function to find the next activity. For example, for each event in the case, check if the next event in the same case is the next in the sequence.

Alternatively, using a nested query. For example, for each case, we can check if the sequence exists by checking if the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in the same case.

So, for example, the first step would be to find all cases that have the three activities in order. Then, for those cases, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

But how to do that. Let me outline the steps.

1. Find all cases that have the three activities in sequence. Let's call this set A.

2. For each case in A, find the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

3. If that time difference is more than 5 days, then exclude the case from the final result.

4. The final result is all events except those in cases that are in A and have the time difference over 5 days.

So, the query needs to exclude cases that meet both conditions. So, the final result is all events except those that are in A and have the time difference over 5 days.

Now, how to implement this in SQL.

First, grouping by case_id. Let's think about using a window function to find the sequence. For example, for each case, we can check if the three activities are present in order.

Let me try to write a query that finds all the cases where the three activities are in sequence. Let's say we can use a CTE that for each case, finds the order of activities.

For example, we can use a subquery that for each case, lists all events in order. Then, for each event, check if the next event is the next in the sequence.

But how to do that. Let's think of it as a sequence of events. For example, for each case, we can check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive events where the first is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the second is 'Create Order', and the third is 'Confirm Order'.

So, for each case, we can check if the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in the same case.

So, perhaps using a subquery that for each case, checks for the existence of these three activities in order.

Another approach: For each event in the case, check if the next event (in the same case) is the next in the sequence. So, for example, for each event, if the next event is the next activity in the sequence, then we can mark it as part of the sequence.

But how to do that. Let's think of it as a series of events. For example, for a case, we can check if there exists a position i where:

event at i is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', event at i+1 is 'Create Order', and event at i+2 is 'Confirm Order'.

So, for each case, we can check if such i exists.

To do this, perhaps we can use a window function to find the next events.

Alternatively, using a CTE that for each case, we can check for the presence of the three activities in order.

Let me try to write a query that does that. For example:

WITH case_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        seq_num
    FROM case_events
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND seq_num = 1
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM case_events
        WHERE case_id = case_events.case_id
        AND seq_num = 2
        AND activity = 'Create Order'
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM case_events
        WHERE case_id = case_events.case_id
        AND seq_num = 3
        AND activity = 'Confirm Order'
    )
)
SELECT case_id
FROM sequence_check
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;

Wait, this is not correct. Because the sequence_check is checking for the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in the same case. But this approach would require that the three events are consecutive in the case. However, the way I wrote the query, the first part is checking for the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' (seq_num=1), then checking for the next event (seq_num=2) as 'Create Order', and then seq_num=3 as 'Confirm Order'.

But this would only check for a single sequence where the three activities are in order, but not necessarily consecutive. Wait, no. Because the seq_num is the row number ordered by timestamp. So, if the first event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' (seq_num=1), then the next event is seq_num=2, which would be 'Create Order', and then seq_num=3 would be 'Confirm Order'. So, this would capture the case where the three events are consecutive in the case.

But this approach would require that the three events are in sequence. However, the way the query is written, the first event is the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and then the next two events are 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in the same case. But this would only work if the three events are consecutive in the case. So, this would capture the cases where the three activities are in sequence, with no other events in between.

But this approach might miss cases where the three activities are not in order, but the same case has them in sequence. Wait, no. Because the first event is the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and then the next two events are the next in the sequence.

But this approach would only find cases where the three activities are consecutive in the case, but not necessarily the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order'.

But this is correct. Because for the three activities to be in sequence, they need to be consecutive in the case. So, the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' must be followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in the same case. But if the case has more than three events, but the three are consecutive, then this approach would capture it.

But what if the case has the three activities in non-consecutive positions? For example, if the case has 'Approve Purchase Requisition' at position 1, then 'Create Order' at position 3, then 'Confirm Order' at position 5. Then, the query would not find this because the first event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' (seq_num=1), then the next event is 'Create Order' (seq_num=3), which is not consecutive. So, the query would not find this case.

So, this approach would only find cases where the three activities are consecutive. So, this seems correct.

But the problem states that the three events must appear in direct succession. So, they need to be consecutive in the case. Therefore, this approach would correctly find those cases.

So, the sequence_check CTE would find the cases that have the three activities in order, consecutive in the case. Then, the next step is to check for the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

So, once we have the case_ids that have the sequence, we need to check for each case if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Then, exclude those cases.

So, for each case in sequence_check, we need to find the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. Let's think about that.

For each case, we can find the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event. Then, compute the difference in timestamps.

But how to do that. For example, in the case where the three events are consecutive, the 'Create Order' is the second event, and 'Confirm Order' is the third. So, for each case, we can find the timestamps of these two events and calculate the difference.

So, perhaps for each case, we can get the timestamp of the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event, then compute the difference.

But how to do that in SQL. Let's think.

In the sequence_check CTE, we have the case_id. So, for each case in sequence_check, we can find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

But how to do that. We can use a subquery to find the timestamps of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events for each case.

Alternatively, we can use a CTE that for each case, finds the three events in order. Then, for each case, we can find the timestamps of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

So, after the sequence_check CTE, we can do a JOIN with the original event_log table to get the timestamps of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

Wait, but the original event_log table has all events. So, perhaps we can do this:

Once we have the case_ids that have the sequence, we can for each case, find the 'Create Order' event and 'Confirm Order' event, then compute the difference between their timestamps.

But how to find these events. For example, for a case, the 'Create Order' event is the second event in the sequence, and the 'Confirm Order' is the third. So, for each case, we can find the timestamps of these two events.

So, perhaps:

WITH case_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM case_events
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND seq_num = 1
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM case_events
        WHERE case_id = case_events.case_id
        AND seq_num = 2
        AND activity = 'Create Order'
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM case_events
        WHERE case_id = case_events.case_id
        AND seq_num = 3
        AND activity = 'Confirm Order'
    )
),
create_order_confirm AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Create Order' THEN timestamp END) AS create_order_timestamp,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_order_timestamp
    FROM case_events
    WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_check)
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT
    case_id
FROM create_order_confirm
WHERE
    create_order_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND confirm_order_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND (confirm_order_timestamp - create_order_timestamp) > 5 * 24 * 3600  -- 5 days in seconds
    -- Or convert to days
    -- Wait, 5 days is 5 * 24 * 3600 seconds, but in DuckDB, we can use date_diff or similar functions.

But wait, the problem says that the time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. So, we need to compute the difference between the two timestamps and check if it's greater than 5 days.

But how to compute that. In DuckDB, the date_diff function can be used. For example, date_diff('2023-01-01', '2023-01-06') would give 5 days.

But the timestamps are stored as datetime values. So, we can compute the difference between the two timestamps.

So, in the create_order_confirm CTE, for each case, we can get the create_order_timestamp and confirm_order_timestamp, then calculate the difference.

But how to handle the case where the two events are not in the same case? Well, the create_order_confirm CTE is filtered to only include cases that are in sequence_check, so they must have the three events.

So, in the create_order_confirm CTE, for each case, we get the timestamps of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events.

Once we have that, we can compute the difference.

But in the create_order_confirm CTE, we have to make sure that the create_order_timestamp and confirm_order_timestamp are not NULL. So, the WHERE clause would be:

WHERE create_order_timestamp IS NOT NULL AND confirm_order_timestamp IS NOT NULL

Then, check if confirm_order_timestamp - create_order_timestamp > 5 days.

But in DuckDB, the date_diff function is available. So, for example, if we have two timestamps, we can compute the difference in days.

But how to do that. Let's think: the timestamp is a datetime. So, if we have two timestamps, say, t1 and t2, then the difference between them can be computed as t2 - t1, and then we can check if that difference is greater than 5 days.

But in DuckDB, the date_diff function can be used to compute the difference in days. For example:

date_diff(t2, t1) > 5

But this would give the number of days between t1 and t2. So, if the difference is more than 5 days, then it's okay.

But in terms of the actual timestamps, perhaps we can use the date_diff function. Alternatively, we can compute the difference in seconds and then divide by 86400 (seconds per day) to get days.

But for simplicity, using date_diff might be easier.

So, the condition would be:

(confirm_order_timestamp - create_order_timestamp) > 5

But wait, the date_diff function returns the difference in days. So, if the difference is 5 days, then the condition is (date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5).

But in DuckDB, the date_diff function is available as date_diff(t1, t2) returns the difference in days. So, in the create_order_confirm CTE, we can compute the difference as:

date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5

But how to do that in the query. Let's think.

So, the create_order_confirm CTE would have:

SELECT
    case_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Create Order' THEN timestamp END) AS create_order_timestamp,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_order_timestamp
FROM case_events
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_check)
GROUP BY case_id

But this is incorrect. Because the MIN function would return the earliest occurrence of the activity. But in this case, the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events are consecutive in the case. So, the first occurrence of 'Create Order' is the second event in the sequence, and the 'Confirm Order' is the third. So, for each case, the 'Create Order' is the second event, and the 'Confirm Order' is the third. So, the MIN function would pick the earliest occurrence, which is correct.

But if the case has multiple instances of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', but the first occurrence is the one that's needed. So, the MIN function would get the earliest one, which is correct.

So, the create_order_confirm CTE would have the two timestamps.

Now, the next step is to filter the cases where the difference between confirm_order_timestamp and create_order_timestamp is more than 5 days.

So, in the create_order_confirm CTE, after getting the two timestamps, we can do a WHERE clause:

WHERE (confirm_order_timestamp - create_order_timestamp) > 5

But in DuckDB, the date_diff function can be used. So, maybe:

WHERE date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5

But how to handle that. Let's think about the actual data types. The timestamps are datetime values, so the difference between two datetime values would be a duration, and date_diff would return the number of days.

But in DuckDB, the date_diff function is used as date_diff(t1, t2) returns the number of days between t1 and t2. So, if we have two timestamps, say, t1 is '2023-01-01 00:00:00' and t2 is '2023-01-06 00:00:00', then date_diff(t2, t1) would be 5.

So, the condition would be:

date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5

But in the create_order_confirm CTE, we can't directly use that, because we need to compute the difference. So, the code would be:

SELECT
    case_id
FROM create_order_confirm
WHERE
    date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5

But how to structure this in the query.

Putting it all together:

The main query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM sequence_check
    WHERE
        (date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5)
)

But wait, the sequence_check is the cases that have the three activities in sequence. Then, the create_order_confirm is for those cases, and we need to find those cases where the time between the two events is more than 5 days. Then, those cases are excluded.

So, the final query would be to select all events from event_log except those that are in the cases that are in the sequence_check and have the time difference over 5 days.

But how to structure this. Let me think again.

The plan is:

1. Find all cases that have the three activities in sequence (sequence_check).

2. For those cases, find the create_order_timestamp and confirm_order_timestamp.

3. Check if the time between them is more than 5 days.

4. Exclude those cases from the final result.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Create Order' THEN timestamp END) AS create_order_timestamp,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_order_timestamp
        FROM event_log
        WHERE case_id IN (
            SELECT case_id
            FROM (
                SELECT
                    case_id,
                    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
                FROM event_log
                WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
                ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
            ) AS temp
            WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
            AND seq_num = 1
            AND EXISTS (
                SELECT 1
                FROM temp
                WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
                AND seq_num = 2
                AND activity = 'Create Order'
            )
            AND EXISTS (
                SELECT 1
                FROM temp
                WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
                AND seq_num = 3
                AND activity = 'Confirm Order'
            )
        )
        GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS create_order_confirm
    WHERE date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5
)

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to simplify.

Alternative approach:

We can use a CTE to find all cases that have the three activities in sequence, then for those cases, find the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events, and exclude those cases where the time is more than 5 days.

So, the query would be:

WITH sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
        FROM event_log
        WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
        ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
    ) AS temp
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND seq_num = 1
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp
        WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
        AND seq_num = 2
        AND activity = 'Create Order'
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp
        WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
        AND seq_num = 3
        AND activity = 'Confirm Order'
    )
),
create_order_confirm AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Create Order' THEN timestamp END) AS create_order_timestamp,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_order_timestamp
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT
    case_id
FROM create_order_confirm
WHERE
    date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5
    AND create_order_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND confirm_order_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND (confirm_order_timestamp - create_order_timestamp) > 5

But then, the final result is all events except those in the cases that are in create_order_confirm and have the time difference over 5 days. So, the main query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM create_order_confirm
    WHERE date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5
)

But this seems correct. However, there's a problem here. The create_order_confirm CTE is selecting case_ids that have the three activities in sequence and have the time difference over 5 days. So, the final query is excluding those case_ids from the event_log.

But the problem is that the create_order_confirm CTE is selecting case_ids that are in the sequence_cases and have the time difference over 5 days. So, the final query is selecting all events from event_log except those cases that are in the create_order_confirm CTE.

But the create_order_confirm CTE is derived from the sequence_cases and the time difference. So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM create_order_confirm
    WHERE date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5
)

But this is not correct, because the create_order_confirm CTE includes the case_ids that have the sequence and the time difference over 5 days. So, the final query is excluding those case_ids.

But the create_order_confirm CTE is a subquery that selects case_ids that are in the sequence_cases and have the time difference over 5 days. So, the final query would exclude those case_ids from the event_log.

But how to structure this in the query.

Another approach is to use a CTE that finds all the case_ids that are in the sequence and have the time difference over 5 days, and then exclude them from the final result.

So, the full query would be:

WITH sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
        FROM event_log
        WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
        ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
    ) AS temp
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND seq_num = 1
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp
        WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
        AND seq_num = 2
        AND activity = 'Create Order'
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp
        WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
        AND seq_num = 3
        AND activity = 'Confirm Order'
    )
),
create_order_confirm AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Create Order' THEN timestamp END) AS create_order_timestamp,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_order_timestamp
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT
    *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM create_order_confirm
    WHERE date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5
)

But wait, the create_order_confirm CTE is selecting case_ids that have the three activities in sequence and have the time difference over 5 days. So, the final query is excluding those case_ids.

But in the create_order_confirm CTE, the GROUP BY case_id and the MIN functions for the timestamps would get the first occurrence of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in the case. However, in the sequence_cases, the case_ids are those that have the three activities in sequence. So, the create_order_confirm CTE is for those cases, and the time difference is computed.

But in the final query, we need to exclude those case_ids where the time difference is over 5 days. So, the subquery in the WHERE clause is selecting the case_ids that are in create_order_confirm and have the time difference over 5 days. Then, the main query excludes those case_ids.

But there's a problem here. The create_order_confirm CTE may have multiple rows per case, but the GROUP BY case_id ensures that each case is only considered once. However, in the create_order_confirm CTE, the MIN functions would get the earliest occurrence of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in the case, which is correct.

But what about cases where the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' are not in the same case? No, because the case_id is in the sequence_cases, so the case has the three activities in sequence.

So, this should work.

But the problem is that the create_order_confirm CTE is selecting case_ids where the three activities are in sequence, and then we check the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. So, the final query is excluding those cases.

But there's a possible issue with the date_diff function. For example, if the timestamps are not in the same timezone, but the problem probably assumes that the timestamps are in the same timezone, so the date_diff function should work.

Another thing to consider: the date_diff function in DuckDB. Let me check. DuckDB's date_diff function is available as date_diff, which takes two dates and returns the difference in days. So, for example, date_diff('2023-01-01', '2023-01-06') is 5.

So, the condition date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5 would correctly check if the time between them is more than 5 days.

So, putting it all together, the SQL query would be as follows.

But also, we need to make sure that the create_order_timestamp and confirm_order_timestamp are not NULL. So, adding:

AND create_order_timestamp IS NOT NULL
AND confirm_order_timestamp IS NOT NULL

But in the create_order_confirm CTE, the MIN functions would return NULL if there are no such events. However, since the case_ids are in sequence_cases, which is derived from the existence of the three activities, the create_order_timestamp and confirm_order_timestamp should not be NULL.

But to be safe, we can include those conditions.

So, the final query would be:

WITH sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
        FROM event_log
        WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
        ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
    ) AS temp
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND seq_num = 1
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp
        WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
        AND seq_num = 2
        AND activity = 'Create Order'
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp
        WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
        AND seq_num = 3
        AND activity = 'Confirm Order'
    )
),
create_order_confirm AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Create Order' THEN timestamp END) AS create_order_timestamp,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_order_timestamp
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT
    *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM create_order_confirm
    WHERE date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5
)

But wait, the create_order_confirm CTE is selecting case_ids that are in sequence_cases, and then we check if the time difference is over 5 days. So, the subquery in the NOT IN is selecting the case_ids that are in create_order_confirm and have the time difference over 5 days. Then, the main query excludes those case_ids.

This should work.

Testing this query, let's imagine an example.

Case 1: case_id = 1, events in order: Approve, Create, Confirm. Timestamps are 2023-01-01, 2023-01-02, 2023-01-03. The time difference between Create and Confirm is 1 day, so it's not excluded. So, this case is included in the final result.

Case 2: case_id = 2, events in order: Approve, Create, Confirm. Timestamps are 2023-01-01, 2023-01-05, 2023-01-06. The time difference is 1 day, so not excluded. So, included in the final result.

Case 3: case_id = 3, events in order: Approve, Create, Confirm. Timestamps are 2023-01-01, 2023-01-07, 2023-01-12. Time difference is 5 days. So, this case is excluded from the final result.

So, the query should correctly exclude case 3.

But what if the time difference is exactly 5 days? The condition is > 5 days, so it's excluded.

But what if the time difference is 5 days but the timestamps are different? For example, if the Create is 2023-01-01, and Confirm is 2023-01-06 (5 days later). Then, date_diff is 5, so it's not excluded. So, the query correctly excludes cases where the time is exactly 5 days.

So, the query is correct.

Now, considering the initial problem: the user wants to return all events from event_log except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and the timing condition. So, the final query is correct.

But what about cases where the three activities are in sequence but the time difference is less than or equal to 5 days? Those cases are included in the final result.

Another possible edge case: a case with the three activities in sequence, but the Create Order is the second event and the Confirm Order is the third, but the timestamp of the Create is the same as the timestamp of the Confirm. Then, the difference is zero, which is not excluded. So, it's included.

Another edge case: a case where the three activities are in sequence, but the Create Order is the first event. No, because the sequence requires that the first event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', which is the first in the sequence. So, the Create Order is the second event.

So, the query seems correct.

Now, the final query is as above. Let me write it in the correct syntax.

Also, need to make sure that the date_diff is correctly used. In DuckDB, the date_diff function is available. For example:

SELECT date_diff('2023-01-01', '2023-01-06') AS days;

But in the query, the date_diff is used as:

date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5

But in DuckDB, the function is called date_diff, which takes two datetime values. So, the query is correct.

Another thing: the create_order_confirm CTE is selecting case_ids that have the three activities in sequence, and then the time difference. The main query is selecting all events except those in the create_order_confirm CTE where the time difference is over 5 days.

Thus, the final query should work.

Now, the user might have some issues with the order of the events, but the query should handle that correctly.

So, the final answer is the SQL query as written above.
</think>
To solve the given problem, we need to filter out events from the `event_log` table based on the following criteria:

---

### **Key Requirements Recap**

1. **Filter Cases**:
   - Identify cases (`case_id`) that contain the exact sequence of three consecutive activities:
     - `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`
     - `'Create Order'`
     - `'Confirm Order'`
   - These three activities must appear in **exactly that order**, with **no other activity** in between them.

2. **Filter by Time Difference**:
   - Among those cases, only those where the **time elapsed** between the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events is **more than 5 days** should be **excluded** from the final result.

3. **Final Output**:
   - Return **all events from `event_log`** that **do not belong to any case** that satisfies both:
     - The sequence of activities.
     - The time condition.

###  **SQL Query Implementation**

```sql
WITH sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
        FROM event_log
        WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
        ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
    ) AS temp
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND seq_num = 1
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp
        WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
        AND seq_num = 2
        AND activity = 'Create Order'
    )
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM temp
        WHERE case_id = temp.case_id
        AND seq_num = 3
        AND activity = 'Confirm Order'
    )
),
create_order_confirm AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Create Order' THEN timestamp END) AS create_order_timestamp,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN timestamp END) AS confirm_order_timestamp
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM create_order_confirm
    WHERE date_diff(confirm_order_timestamp, create_order_timestamp) > 5
);
```

###  **Explanation of the Logic**

- **`sequence_cases`**:
  - Identifies cases that contain the exact sequence of three activities in order.
  - Uses a window function to ensure the three events are **consecutive**.
  - Filters only those cases that have the required sequence.

- **`create_order_confirm`**:
  - Extracts the timestamps of the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events for each case that has the sequence.
  - Uses `MIN()` to find the earliest occurrence of the two events within each case.

- **Final `SELECT`**:
  - Excludes **any case** that has the sequence of three activities and a time difference **greater than 5 days**.
  - Returns **only those events** that belong to **cases that do not meet the exclusion criteria**.

---

###  **Important Notes**

- The `date_diff` function is used to compare the time difference between the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events in days.
- The `MIN()` function ensures that we only consider the **first occurrence** of each activity in the sequence.
- This query ensures that **only the required cases are excluded**, and all other events are returned.

---

###  **Result Format**

The output consists of **all events from `event_log`** except those that belong to cases that:
- Contain the sequence of three activities in order.
- Have a time difference **greater than 5 days** between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'`.

This ensures **correct filtering** and **exclusion** of the specified cases.
