The process describes the steps involved in a medical procedure, likely a central venous catheter insertion guided by ultrasound. Here's a breakdown:

**Preparation Phase:**

1. **Start Event:** The process begins.
2. **Prepare implements:** Gathering necessary equipment.
3. **Hand washing:** Standard hygiene practice.
4. **Get in sterile clothes:** Maintaining a sterile environment.
5. **Clean puncture area:** Preparing the patient's skin.
6. **Drap puncture area:** Covering the surrounding skin with sterile drapes.
7. **Ultrasound configuration:** Setting up the ultrasound machine.
8. **Gel in probe:** Applying ultrasound gel to the probe.
9. **Cover probe:** Covering the probe with a sterile sheath.
10. **Put sterile gel:** Applying sterile gel to the puncture area.
11. **Position probe:** Placing the ultrasound probe for imaging.
12. **Position patient:** Ensuring the patient is in the correct position.

**Vein Identification Phase:**

13. **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging):**  This gateway branches the process into three possible vein identification methods:
    * **Doppler identification:** Using Doppler ultrasound to locate the vein.
    * **Anatomic identification:** Identifying the vein based on anatomical landmarks.
    * **Compression identification:** Using compression to visualize the vein.

14. **Exclusive Gateway (Converging):**  This gateway merges the three identification paths back into the main process flow.

**Puncture and Catheter Insertion Phase:**

15. **Anesthetize:** Applying local anesthetic to the puncture area.
16. **Exclusive Gateway (Converging - Part of Loop):** This gateway handles the scenario where blood return is not achieved on the first attempt.
17. **Puncture:** Inserting the needle into the vein.
18. **Blood return:** Checking for blood return to confirm venous access.
19. **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging - Part of Loop):**  If blood return is achieved, the process continues. If not, it loops back to Anesthetize and Puncture may be retried. This loop between steps 16, 17, 18, and 19 suggests the practitioner may adjust the needle position and attempt puncture again if they do not immediately hit the vein. The gateway after step 18 represents the decision point based on whether blood return was observed.
20. **Drop Probe (If no blood return loop):** If no blood return, the ultrasound guidance may be discontinued. This leads back to step 15 (Anesthetize) in preparation for another attempt and potentially revisiting the identification step.
21. **Remove syringe (If no blood return loop):** Removing the syringe from the initial puncture attempt. This leads to step 22.
22. **Guidewire install:** Inserting a guidewire through the needle into the vein.
23. **Remove trocar:** Removing the needle, leaving the guidewire in place.

**Guidewire Verification and Catheter Advancement Phase:**

24. **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging):** This gateway branches the process into two possible guidewire verification methods:
    * **Check wire in long axis:** Viewing the guidewire along the long axis of the vein.
    * **Check wire in short axis:** Viewing the guidewire across the short axis of the vein.

25. **Exclusive Gateway (Converging):** This gateway merges the two verification paths.
26. **Wire in good position:** Confirmation that the guidewire is correctly placed.

27. **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging - Catheter Placement Check Loop):** This gateway is the entry point for the loop concerning catheter placement.
28. **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging - Before Widening Pathway):** This gateway diverges into two paths: one continues the process, another returns to the previous converging gateway if the wire isn't in a good position. This loop encompasses steps 27-28 and provides an opportunity to adjust the wire if needed before proceeding with catheter insertion.
29. **Widen pathway:** Expanding the tract created by the needle to accommodate the catheter.
30. **Advance catheter:** Inserting the catheter over the guidewire.
31. **Remove guidewire:** Removing the guidewire, leaving the catheter in place.
32. **Check flow and reflow:** Confirming proper catheter function.
33. **Check catheter position:** Verifying the final catheter placement using imaging.
34. **Exclusive Gateway (Converging - Catheter Placement Check Loop):** This gateway manages the decision to loop back to widening the pathway or to proceed. This loop is formed by the gates at steps 27 and 34 and appears to address potential difficulties in advancing the catheter over the guidewire.
35. **End Event:** The process is complete.

This detailed breakdown provides a clear understanding of the sequential steps involved in this medical procedure, including alternative paths for vein identification and loops for handling potential complications during puncture and catheter insertion.
