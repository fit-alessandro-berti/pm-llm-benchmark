```sql
-- First, we determine the number of events per `case_id`
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        `case_id`,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        `case_id`
)
-- Then, we filter out cases with more than six events
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    case_event_counts cec ON el.`case_id` = cec.`case_id`
WHERE 
    cec.event_count <= 6;
```

This solution comprises two key steps:

1. **Calculating the Event Count per Case:** We first create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `case_event_counts` that calculates the number of events for each `case_id`. This helps in identifying the cases that have more than six events.

2. **Filtering and Retrieving Relevant Events:** We then use this CTE to filter out cases with more than six events using a `JOIN` operation and a `WHERE` clause. The final `SELECT` statement retrieves all events from the remaining cases, i.e., those with six or fewer events.
