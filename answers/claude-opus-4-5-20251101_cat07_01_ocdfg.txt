# Business Process Flow Visualization

This is a **process mining or workflow diagram** that illustrates multiple interconnected business processes related to order management and procurement. Here's a breakdown:

## Object Types (Top Row)
The diagram shows 5 different business object categories with their volumes:
- **PurchaseRequisitionItem** (2.0M objects)
- **SalesOrderItem** (3.5M objects)
- **PurchaseOrderItem** (5.0M objects)
- **VendorInvoiceItem** (1.2M objects)
- **ReturnOrderItem** (0.8M objects)

## Process Steps
The workflow includes several key activities with their overall volumes:

| Activity | Volume |
|----------|--------|
| Create Requisition | 3.0M |
| Create Order | 8.5M |
| Approve Requisition | 5.7M |
| Send Order | 5.2M |
| Check Stock | 1.0M |
| Process Return | 0.8M |
| Pack Goods | 2.0M |
| Ship Goods | 1.8M |
| Approve Payment | 1.5M |
| Confirm Delivery | 1.7M |
| Create Invoice | 2.0M |
| Close Order | 1.7M |

## Flow Characteristics
- **Transition times** are shown on arrows (ranging from 100ms to 800ms)
- **Color-coded paths** represent different process variants or object flows
- Multiple **Start** and **End** nodes indicate parallel process streams
- The diagram reveals process convergence points (like "Approve Requisition") and divergence points

This appears to be output from a **process mining tool** (like Celonis or similar), visualizing actual process execution data.
