To produce a single, integrated event log, we'll follow the outlined strategy:
1.  **Parse Logs**: Convert raw string entries into structured event objects (dictionaries).
2.  **Define Matching Criteria**:
    *   `order_id` must be identical.
    *   Timestamp difference must be less than or equal to 2 seconds (`abs(timestamp_A - timestamp_B) <= 2 seconds`).
    *   Event types/names should be semantically similar.
3.  **Match and Merge**: Iterate through Log A events, attempting to find a corresponding event in Log B.
    *   If a match is found, create a new "merged" event record combining all attributes. Log A's timestamp will be prioritized for chronological sorting (as the "primary timeline"), but both original timestamps will be preserved.
    *   Mark matched Log B events as "consumed" to prevent re-matching.
4.  **Handle Unmatched Events**: After processing all Log A events, any remaining Log B events are added as-is. Similarly, any Log A events that found no match are added as-is.
5.  **Chronological Sort**: Sort the final list of events by their designated primary timestamp.
6.  **Document Reasoning**: Explain all decisions made during matching, merging, and conflict resolution.

### **Matching and Merging Process:**

We'll iterate through Log A events and look for matches in Log B.

1.  **Process A1 (Order Received, 10:00:00)**
    *   Search in Log B for `Order#1234` events near 10:00:00.
    *   **B1 (OrderReceived, 09:59:58)**:
        *   `order_id`: Match (`Order#1234`).
        *   Timestamp difference: `|10:00:00 - 09:59:58| = 2 seconds`. This is `<= 2 seconds`.
        *   Semantic match: "Order Received" vs "OrderReceived" – Yes.
    *   **Decision**: Merge A1 and B1.
        *   `primary_timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z` (from Log A).
        *   `unified_event_name`: "Order Received".
        *   Attributes: Combine all from A1 and B1.
    *   Mark B1 as consumed.

2.  **Process A2 (Order Validated, 10:01:30)**
    *   Search in Log B for `Order#1234` events near 10:01:30 (excluding consumed B1).
    *   **B2 (OrderValidation, 10:01:29)**:
        *   `order_id`: Match (`Order#1234`).
        *   Timestamp difference: `|10:01:30 - 10:01:29| = 1 second`. This is `<= 2 seconds`.
        *   Semantic match: "Order Validated" vs "OrderValidation" – Yes.
    *   **Decision**: Merge A2 and B2.
        *   `primary_timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z` (from Log A).
        *   `unified_event_name`: "Order Validated".
        *   Attributes: Combine all from A2 and B2.
    *   Mark B2 as consumed.

3.  **Process A3 (Payment Processed, 10:02:00)**
    *   Search in Log B for `Order#1234` events near 10:02:00 (excluding consumed B1, B2).
    *   **B3 (PaymentCheck, 10:02:05)**:
        *   `order_id`: Match (`Order#1234`).
        *   Timestamp difference: `|10:02:00 - 10:02:05| = 5 seconds`. This is `> 2 seconds`.
        *   Despite semantic similarity, the timestamp difference exceeds the defined tolerance.
    *   **Decision**: A3 is **not matched**. Include A3 as a Log A-only event.

4.  **Process A4 (Item Shipped, 10:05:00)**
    *   Search in Log B for `Order#1234` events near 10:05:00 (excluding consumed B1, B2).
    *   **B5 (Shipping, 10:05:02)**:
        *   `order_id`: Match (`Order#1234`).
        *   Timestamp difference: `|10:05:00 - 10:05:02| = 2 seconds`. This is `<= 2 seconds`.
        *   Semantic match: "Item Shipped" vs "Shipping" – Yes.
    *   **Decision**: Merge A4 and B5.
        *   `primary_timestamp`: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z` (from Log A).
        *   `unified_event_name`: "Item Shipped".
        *   Attributes: Combine all from A4 and B5.
    *   Mark B5 as consumed.

5.  **Process A5 (Item Delivered, 10:20:00)**
    *   Search in Log B for `Order#1234` events near 10:20:00 (excluding consumed B1, B2, B5).
    *   No suitable match found in Log B.
    *   **Decision**: A5 is **not matched**. Include A5 as a Log A-only event.

6.  **Process Remaining Log B Events**:
    *   **B3 (PaymentCheck, 10:02:05)**: Was not matched by A3 due to timestamp tolerance.
        *   **Decision**: Include B3 as a Log B-only event.
    *   **B4 (Quality Check, 10:03:00)**: Was not considered a match for any Log A event.
        *   **Decision**: Include B4 as a Log B-only event.

### **Final Integrated Event Log (Chronologically Ordered):**

For clarity, attributes from Log A are prefixed with `log_A_` and from Log B with `log_B_` when merged. A `primary_timestamp` is used for sorting.

### **Reasoning for Decisions:**

1.  **Timestamp Tolerance (2 Seconds)**:
    *   The core matching rule applied a strict 2-second difference. This was crucial for deciding whether events represented the same occurrence.
    *   **Example**: "Order Received" (A1) at 10:00:00 and "OrderReceived" (B1) at 09:59:58 were merged because the difference (2 seconds) met the `<= 2 seconds` criterion.
    *   **Example of Non-Match**: "Payment Processed" (A3) at 10:02:00 and "PaymentCheck" (B3) at 10:02:05 were *not* merged. Despite their semantic similarity, the 5-second difference exceeded the tolerance. This demonstrates strict adherence to the defined rule, leading to two separate events in the final log.

2.  **Primary Timestamp for Sorting**:
    *   For merged events, the timestamp from **Log A** was chosen as the `primary_timestamp` for sorting the final log. This aligns with the requirement that Log A is considered the "primary timeline."
    *   For events that appeared only in one log, their original timestamp served as their `primary_timestamp`.

3.  **Event Naming Conventions and Unified Names**:
    *   **Merged Events**: A `unified_event_name` field was introduced (e.g., "Order Received", "Order Validated", "Item Shipped"). This name was typically derived from Log A's `event_type` as it represents the primary system's view. To retain full context, the original `log_A_event_type` and `log_B_event_name` attributes were also included.
    *   **Unmatched Events**: Events appearing only in Log A or Log B retained their original `event_type` or `event_name` attribute, respectively.

4.  **Attribute Merging**:
    *   For merged events, all unique attributes from both source logs were combined into a single record.
    *   Where attribute names overlapped (like timestamps or event names), new, distinct attribute names were created (e.g., `log_A_timestamp`, `log_B_timestamp`, `log_A_event_type`, `log_B_event_name`) to prevent loss of information and clearly indicate origin.
    *   Other unique attributes from Log B (e.g., `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`) were directly incorporated into the merged event, enriching the data.

5.  **Handling Missing or Non-Overlapping Events**:
    *   Events for which no suitable match was found within the defined criteria (order ID, timestamp tolerance, semantic similarity) were included as standalone entries in the final log.
    *   Each such event was clearly marked with its `source` (e.g., "Log A Only", "Log B Only").
    *   **Example**: "Item Delivered" (A5) from Log A had no counterpart in Log B and was included as "Log A Only".
    *   **Example**: "Quality Check" (B4) from Log B had no corresponding event in Log A and was included as "Log B Only".

This comprehensive approach ensures that all available event data is integrated, its origin is traceable, and the final output is chronologically coherent and richly attributed.
