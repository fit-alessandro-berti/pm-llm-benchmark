First, the user wants a Python dictionary for the temporal profile. It should map pairs of activities to a tuple of (average_time, standard_deviation). The pairs aren't just directly following ones; they include any activities that eventually follow each other in at least one trace.

The activities are:

- SS: Supplier Selection

- OP: Order Placement

- RC: Receive Components

- QI: Quality Inspection

- CA: Component Assembly

- PT: Product Testing

- PK: Packaging

- WS: Warehouse Storage

- DT: Distribution

- AS: After-Sales Support

I need to consider pairs like (A, B), (A, C), etc., from traces. A typical trace might be: SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS.

For example, in the trace <SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS>, pairs would include (SS, OP), (SS, RC), (SS, QI), up to (SS, AS), and so on for every pair.

The prompt says: "for each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other)"

So, I have to include a representative subset, not all possible pairs, to keep it complex but manageable.

I need to estimate average times and standard deviations. The user says: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." So, I have to make reasonable estimates based on real-world knowledge.

Let me think about realistic times for these activities:

1. **SS to OP**: Supplier selection might take a few days, then order placement is quick. Say, average 2 days between SS and OP.

2. **OP to RC**: Order placement to receiving components depends on supplier lead time, maybe 1-2 weeks.

3. **RC to QI**: Receiving to inspection, probably a day or so.

4. **QI to CA**: Inspection to assembly, if components pass, maybe immediate or a day.

5. **CA to PT**: Assembly to testing, could be a few days if assembly takes time.

6. **PT to PK**: Testing to packaging, quick, maybe hours.

7. **PK to WS**: Packaging to storage, immediate.

8. **WS to DT**: Storage to distribution, could be days or weeks depending on demand.

9. **DT to AS**: Distribution to after-sales, after the product is sold, so maybe months later.

For non-direct pairs, like SS to RC: That would be the time from SS to RC, which includes OP in between, so longer than SS to OP.

I need to calculate or estimate the average time between the first activity and the second in any trace where they appear in that order.

Since it's an average over multiple executions, I'll assume a standard process flow.

Let me sketch a possible dictionary with some pairs.

First, directly connected pairs:

- ('SS', 'OP'): Let's say average 2 days = 172800 seconds (since the example uses seconds), standard deviation 1 day = 86400 seconds.

The example uses seconds: 86400 seconds is 1 day.

So, I'll use seconds for consistency.

Conversions:

- 1 day = 86400 seconds

- 1 hour = 3600 seconds

Now, estimates:

- SS to OP: Maybe 1-2 days. Average: 1 day (86400 s), SD: 0.5 days (43200 s)

- OP to RC: Supplier lead time, say 10 days (864000 s), SD: 2 days (172800 s)

- RC to QI: 1 day (86400 s), SD: 0.5 days (43200 s)

- QI to CA: 2 days (172800 s), SD: 1 day (86400 s) – assuming some preparation time.

- CA to PT: 3 days (259200 s), SD: 1 day (86400 s)

- PT to PK: 1 day (86400 s), SD: 0.5 days (43200 s)

- PK to WS: 0.5 days (43200 s), SD: 0.2 days (17280 s)

- WS to DT: 5 days (432000 s), SD: 2 days (172800 s) – storage time varies.

- DT to AS: After distribution, say 30 days (2,592,000 s), SD: 10 days (864,000 s) – as after-sales might be triggered later.

For non-direct pairs, e.g., SS to RC: Time from SS to RC would be SS to OP + OP to RC, but averaged.

In the temporal profile, it's the average time between the two activities whenever they occur in that order.

So, for ('SS', 'RC'): Average time might be around 11 days (OP to RC average plus SS to OP).

To keep it simple, I'll estimate based on the path.

The prompt says: "a representative subset", so I don't have to do all pairs.

Let's include:

- Direct pairs: as above.

- Some skipped ones, like ('SS', 'RC'), ('SS', 'QI'), ('OP', 'CA'), etc.

To ensure complexity, include pairs separated by multiple steps, like ('SS', 'PT'), ('OP', 'DT').

Let me list a subset:

1. ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 43200)  # 1 day avg, 0.5 day SD

2. ('SS', 'RC'): (864000, 86400)  # 10 days avg, 1 day SD  (estimating the total)

More accurately, if SS to OP is 1 day, OP to RC is 10 days, then SS to RC is about 11 days, say 950400 s, but I'll round.

To make it easy:

('SS', 'RC'): (950400, 86400)  # approx 11 days, SD 1 day

3. ('SS', 'QI'): SS to QI would be SS to RC + RC to QI, say 11 + 1 = 12 days: (1036800, 86400)

4. ('OP', 'CA'): OP to CA includes RC, QI, so OP to RC (10d) + RC to QI (1d) + QI to CA (2d) = 13 days: (1,123,200, 172800)  # SD 2 days

5. And so on.

Finally, compile a dictionary with, say, 8-10 pairs.

Make sure it's a dictionary like: {('A', 'B'): (avg, std)}

Output it in Python code format.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 43200),  # Average: 1 day (e.g., selection to placement), SD: 0.5 days
    ('SS', 'RC'): (950400, 86400),  # Average: ~11 days (including order placement delay), SD: 1 day
    ('SS', 'QI'): (1036800, 86400),  # Average: ~12 days (including receipt and inspection), SD: 1 day
    ('SS', 'PT'): (2073600, 172800),  # Average: ~24 days (spanning multiple steps to testing), SD: 2 days
    ('OP', 'RC'): (864000, 86400),  # Average: 10 days (supplier lead time), SD: 1 day
    ('OP', 'CA'): (1123200, 172800),  # Average: ~13 days (including receipt and inspection), SD: 2 days
    ('OP', 'DT'): (3456000, 259200),  # Average: ~40 days (through assembly, testing, storage), SD: 3 days
    ('RC', 'PT'): (432000, 86400),  # Average: 5 days (from receipt to testing), SD: 1 day
    ('QI', 'WS'): (518400, 86400),  # Average: 6 days (through assembly and testing to storage), SD: 1 day
    ('CA', 'AS'): (3628800, 432000)  # Average: ~42 days (through testing, packaging, distribution), SD: 5 days
}
```

This dictionary represents a representative subset of activity pairs from the global supply chain process. It includes both directly connected pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'OP')) and pairs separated by multiple steps (e.g., ('SS', 'PT'), ('OP', 'DT')), to capture the temporal variability across the process. The estimates for average times and standard deviations are based on reasonable assumptions about supply chain dynamics, such as procurement delays, manufacturing timelines, and distribution lead times, while ensuring the values are in seconds for consistency with the provided example.
