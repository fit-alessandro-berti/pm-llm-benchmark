# Analysis of Insurance Claim Process Anomalies

## 1. Anomalies Identified in the POWL Model

### 1.1 Loop Between Evaluation and Approval
The model includes a loop structure (`loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[E, P])`) that allows repeated cycles of evaluation followed by approval. In a standard insurance claim process, we would typically expect a claim to be evaluated once, then either approved or rejected.

### 1.2 Optional Customer Notification
The XOR gateway (`xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[N, skip])`) makes customer notification optional by allowing the process to skip this step entirely via a silent transition. This is concerning as notification is usually a critical compliance requirement.

### 1.3 Premature Claim Closure
The partial ordering includes a direct edge from assignment to closure (`root.order.add_edge(A, C)`), which allows closing a claim immediately after assigning an adjuster, bypassing evaluation, approval, and notification steps.

### 1.4 Lack of Strict Ordering
The model doesn't enforce that notification must precede closure (missing `root.order.add_edge(xor, C)`), allowing claims to be potentially closed before customer notification.

### 1.5 No Explicit Rejection Path
The model doesn't include a clear path for rejecting claims, which is a common alternative to approval in insurance processes.

## 2. Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Exist

### 2.1 Loop Between Evaluation and Approval

**Hypothesis 1a**: The loop represents a legitimate business need for complex claims that require multiple rounds of evaluation as new information comes in.

**Hypothesis 1b**: This is a design error intended to represent reevaluation after initial problems, but incorrectly implemented as a continuous cycle.

**Hypothesis 1c**: Technical constraints in the workflow system forced modelers to use this structure to handle exceptions.

### 2.2 Optional Customer Notification

**Hypothesis 2a**: Different notification policies exist based on claim types or outcomes (e.g., approvals require notification while rejections might not).

**Hypothesis 2b**: This represents an efficiency-driven business decision to skip notifications for certain low-value claims.

**Hypothesis 2c**: This is a compliance gap where a required step has been incorrectly made optional.

### 2.3 Premature Claim Closure

**Hypothesis 3a**: This path exists to handle special cases like fraudulent or withdrawn claims, where full processing isn't required.

**Hypothesis 3b**: This represents a significant control deficiency allowing claims to be improperly closed.

**Hypothesis 3c**: The path might reflect different handling procedures across departments that weren't harmonized in the model.

### 2.4 Lack of Strict Ordering and Missing Rejection Path

**Hypothesis 4a**: These issues stem from miscommunication between business analysts and process modelers.

**Hypothesis 4b**: The model might be an incomplete draft that was accidentally implemented in production.

**Hypothesis 4c**: System limitations prevented proper implementation of all desired process constraints.

## 3. Database Queries to Verify Hypotheses

### 3.1 Investigating Loop Between Evaluation and Approval

```sql
-- Identify claims with multiple evaluations or approvals
SELECT 
    claim_id, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS eval_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approval_count
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 1 
   OR SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 1
ORDER BY eval_count DESC, approval_count DESC;

-- Analyze patterns in evaluation-approval sequences
WITH claim_eval_approval AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity IN ('E', 'P')
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM claim_eval_approval
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2  -- More than one E and one P combined
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```

### 3.2 Investigating Optional Customer Notification

```sql
-- Identify claims that were closed without customer notification
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'C'
) AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'N'
);

-- Analyze notification patterns by claim type and amount
SELECT 
    c.claim_type,
    CASE 
        WHEN c.claim_amount < 1000 THEN 'Low (<1000)'
        WHEN c.claim_amount BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000 THEN 'Medium (1000-5000)'
        ELSE 'High (>5000)'
    END AS amount_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'N'
    ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS claims_without_notification,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'N'
    ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS percentage_without_notification
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'C')
GROUP BY c.claim_type, amount_category
ORDER BY percentage_without_notification DESC;
```

### 3.3 Investigating Premature Claim Closure

```sql
-- Identify claims closed without proper evaluation or approval
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.submission_date
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'C'
) AND (
    NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'E')
    OR NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P')
);

-- Check if there are claims closed directly after assignment
SELECT ce1.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' 
AND ce2.activity = 'C'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events 
    WHERE claim_id = ce1.claim_id 
    AND activity NOT IN ('R', 'A', 'C')
    AND timestamp BETWEEN ce1.timestamp AND ce2.timestamp
);
```

### 3.4 Investigating Ordering Issues and Process Variants

```sql
-- Check for claims where closing occurs before other expected steps
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS closing_time,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS last_evaluation_time,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS last_approval_time,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notification_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) < 
       MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity IN ('E', 'P', 'N') THEN ce.timestamp END);

-- Analyze the most common process variants
WITH event_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS frequency,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) AS percentage
FROM event_sequences
GROUP BY activity_sequence
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3.5 Investigating Potential Rejection Handling

```sql
-- Look for evidence of claim rejections in the process
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    COUNT(*) AS event_count,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
FROM claim_events
WHERE additional_info LIKE '%reject%' OR additional_info LIKE '%denied%'
GROUP BY claim_id;

-- Identify claims that have evaluation but no approval (potential rejections)
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
FROM claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'E'
) AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P'
) AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'C'
);
```

### 3.6 Investigating Patterns Over Time and By Adjuster

```sql
-- Analyze if anomalies have changed over time
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', c.submission_date) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN anomaly.claim_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS anomalous_claims,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN anomaly.claim_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS percentage_anomalous
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
    FROM claims c1
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c1.claim_id AND activity = 'C')
    AND (
        NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c1.claim_id AND activity = 'E')
        OR NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c1.claim_id AND activity = 'P')
        OR NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = c1.claim_id AND activity = 'N')
    )
) anomaly ON c.claim_id = anomaly.claim_id
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', c.submission_date)
ORDER BY month;

-- Check if specific adjusters or specializations are associated with anomalies
SELECT 
    a.name,
    a.specialization,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) AS total_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN anomaly.claim_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS anomalous_claims,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN anomaly.claim_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id), 2) AS percentage_anomalous
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
    FROM claims
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claims.claim_id AND activity = 'C')
    AND (
        NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claims.claim_id AND activity = 'E')
        OR NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claims.claim_id AND activity = 'P')
        OR NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = claims.claim_id AND activity = 'N')
    )
) anomaly ON c.claim_id = anomaly.claim_id
GROUP BY a.name, a.specialization
ORDER BY percentage_anomalous DESC;
```

These queries should help verify whether the anomalies in the process model reflect actual business practices or represent process deficiencies that need to be addressed. The results would inform decisions about improving the process model to better reflect intended operations while ensuring compliance and control requirements are met.
