This is a process flow diagram that visualizes a sequential task structure, likely part of a business process for handling a request. Each symbol represents steps or decisions in the process. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Start (Circular symbol on the left)**:
   - The process begins here.

2. **Register Request**:
   - The first step is to register the incoming request.

3. **Exclusive Gateway (X-shaped diamond)**:
   - This is a decision point. The process branches into two paths:
     - **Examine Thoroughly**: One task is to thoroughly examine the request.
     - **Examine Casually**: Alternatively, the request could be examined casually.
   
4. **Parallel Gateway (Plus sign within a diamond)**:
   - After thorough examination, there's a parallel gateway allowing multiple branches to be executed concurrently, one of which involves:
     - **Check Ticket**: Another task to check the ticket or some other form of verification.

5. **Path Merge (X-shaped diamond)**:
   - After either of the examinations (casual or thorough), the process converges back.

6. **Parallel Gateway (Plus sign within a diamond)**:
   - The subsequent parallel gateway connects the previous steps and sends the process forward to decide the next action.

7. **Decide**:
   - Another decision point where there's a determination to either process or reject the request.

8. **Exclusive Gateway (X-shaped diamond)**:
   - Here, depending on the decision made earlier, two actions can occur:
     - **Reject Request**: If the request is denied, it's rejected.
     - **Pay Compensation**: If the request is valid, proceed to pay compensation.

9. **Exclusive Gateway (X-shaped diamond)**:
   - After paying compensation or rejecting the request:
     - If necessary, **reinitiate the request**, otherwise proceed to the end.

10. **End (Circular symbol on the right)**:
    - The process concludes.

### Summary
- The process visualizes handling of requests, possibly for services or reimbursement.
- The request is examined either thoroughly or casually, and decision points determine whether to reject or compensate for the request.
- There's flexibility for reinitiating requests based on outcomes.
