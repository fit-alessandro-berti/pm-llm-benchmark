The provided visualization depicts a business process model, most likely represented using **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)**. Here is a breakdown of the elements:

1. **Start Event (Circle on Left)**: The process begins here.

2. **Register Request (Activity box with a rounded rectangle)**: A task where a request is registered.

3. **Exclusive Gateway (Diamond Shape with an 'X')**: The request is routed in different directions based on conditions:
   - One branch leads to "examine thoroughly"
   - The second branch leads to "examine casually"

4. **Examine Thoroughly and Examine Casually (Rounded Activity Boxes)**: These are two different tasks that examine the request with varying levels of detail.

5. **Check Ticket (Activity Box)**: After conducting a thorough examination, a ticket is checked.

6. **Another Exclusive Gateway (Diamond Shape with an 'X')**: This follows the "examine thoroughly" task. It decides the next step.

7. **Parallel Gateway (Diamond with a ‘+’ symbol)**: This indicates that multiple paths can be pursued simultaneously.

8. **Decide Task (Activity Box)**: A decision must be made on what to do with the request after the examination.

9. **Another Exclusive Gateway**: The decision branches to two different outcomes:
   - "Reject request"
   - "Pay compensation"

10. **End Event (Circle on Right)**: The process concludes after either rejecting the request or paying the compensation.

11. **Reinitiate Request (Activity)**: After examining casually, there's an option to "reinitiate request," bringing it back to the earlier stages of processing.

12. **Join Point**: A line from "reinitiate request" joins the flow before reaching the decision-making step, linking it to the next steps.

### Key Flow:
- The process begins with registering a request.
- The request can be examined either thoroughly or casually.
- If examined thoroughly, the ticket is checked, and a decision is made.
- If examined casually, it may be reinitiated.
- Based on the decision, the request is either rejected or compensation is paid, ending the process.

Overall, the diagram models the flow of tasks and decisions in handling requests within a process.
