Certainly! Let's analyze each constraint to ensure that they are logically sound and well-formed:

### 1. Existence:
   - **Explanation**: The activity is executed at least once.
     - Check if there are any constraints where an activity isn't executed or not necessary for the trace formation.

### 2. Absence:
   - **Explanation**: The activity is not executed.
     - Ensure that each activity either has a corresponding occurrence in existing constraints (responses) or can be omitted as expected based on other conditions.

### 3. Exact Occurrence of an Activity:
   - **Explanation**: Exactly 1 indicates that the trace must have only one instance of this activity.
     - Check for any sequence where this constraint is contradicted by other activities occurring multiple times between them.

### 4. Initialization with an Early Trace Start (Trace starts with a given activity).
   - **Explanation**: The trace should start with one of the given initial activities without violating the rules already defined.
     - Ensure that none of the activities listed as 'Initialization: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' violate other constraints.

### 5. Response or Succession:
   - **Explanation**: It must satisfy either a single response (alternating successions, responses) or chain type successions/rules
     - Each activity should only be part of one response chain at the current trace point.
   
### 6. Alternate Response, Precedence and Chain Succession Constraints:
   - These are similar to their predecessors with some modification for alternates.

### Anomalies In Proposed Processes:

1. **Absence Constraint Violation**:
    - The constraints like "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION," "Request Payment," etc., all specify the absence of the same activities. If these constraints are enforced, they would imply a lack of activity in certain conditions which might not align with typical business processes or system flow.
    
2. **Existence Violation**:
    - There is an overlap such as “Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE” and "Request Payment." These two cannot occur without each other, leading to an anomaly.

3. **Concurrent Succession Constraints**: 
    - The constraints for succession might not allow some scenarios where multiple predecessors follow multiple successors due to logical conflicts (such as conflicting activities happening in sequence). 

4. **Failure of Exact Occurances**:
   - If exactly 1 is specified on the same activity, no other constraint should be present to force this occurrence.

5. **Response Alternates and Succession Chains**:
    - The Alternate Response constraints might cause some loops or cycles which need to check for such patterns.

6. **Chain Precedence Violation**: 
   - Ensure that each chain of activities is sequentially followed without contradicting other precedence rules.
   
7. **Co-Existence Contradiction**:
   - For co-existence, if there are multiple occurrences of the same sequence (such as Request Payment then Declaration final approval), this would violate existing constraints leading to no instances.

### Further Steps for Validation:

1. Add validation rules that penalize or reject anomalies in a systematic way.
2. Iterate each constraint and add additional conditions that validate if one rule overrides another, ensuring overall consistency of the model.

In summary, careful analysis of all scenarios within these constraints ensures that they logically map to your business process accurately without overlapping conflicting requirements inherently. 

**Example: A possible anomaly (though unusual) might be "Co-Existence of an identical event" which seems contradictory given typical processes and its implications on logical flow.** 

To validate, implement a logic-driven validation mechanism ensuring no violation across the various rules concurrently.

Is further clarification helpful in understanding more detailed validation or adjustments?
