Here's an example of a Log Skeleton model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {(pair('buy', 'create_purchase_order'))},
    'always_before': {(pair('create_purchase_order', 'send_invoice')), 
                       (pair('send_invoice', 'receive_payment'))},
    'always_after': {(pair('buy', 'create_credit_note')), 
                     (pair('receive_payment', 'close_invoices')),
                     (pair('close_invoices', 'complete_all_tasks'))},
    'never_together': {(pair('buy', 'send_invoice')),
                       (pair('send_invoice', 'ensure_donation')),
                       (pair('create_credit_note', 'ensure_donation'))},
    'activ_freq': {'buy': {1}, 'create_purchase_order': {1}, 
                   'send_invoice': {1}, 'receive_payment': {1}, 
                   'close_invoices': {1}, 'complete_all_tasks': {1}, 
                   'create_credit_note': {1}, 'ensure_donation': {0, 1}},
    'directly_follows': {(pair('buy', 'create_purchase_order')), 
                         (pair('create_purchase_order', 'send_invoice')),
                         (pair('send_invoice', 'receive_payment')),
                         (pair('receive_payment', 'close_invoices')),
                         (pair('close_invoices', 'complete_all_tasks')),
                         (pair('buy', 'create_credit_note')),
                         (pair('ensure_donation', 'create_credit_note')),
                         (pair('receive_payment', 'ensure_donation')),
                         (pair('close_invoices', 'ensure_donation'))}
}
```

In this example, the activities are: `buy`, `create_purchase_order`, `send_invoice`, `receive_payment`, `close_invoices`, `complete_all_tasks`, `create_credit_note`, `ensure_donation`.

- Equivalence: It means that if an order is bought, then it is associated with exactly one purchase order.
- Always Before: It means that a purchase order is generated before sending an invoice, and an invoice is sent before receiving payment, and payment is received before closing the invoices, and so on.
- Always After: It means that after a purchase is bought, a credit note is created, after payment is received, the invoices are closed, and after all tasks are completed, another activity doesn't occur.
- Never Together: It means that a purchase and an invoice cannot occur
