Below I present a structured, practical, and technically-grounded plan that uses process mining as the primary data engine to diagnose the shop’s problems and then to design, test, and operationalize advanced, data-driven scheduling strategies. Each major section addresses one of the five requested points in depth.

1) Analyzing historical scheduling performance and dynamics (how to mine the MES logs)
- Objective: reconstruct the actual flow of each job, measure performance KPIs, quantify resource usage and sequence-dependent setup behavior, and measure the effect of disruptions.

A. Pre-processing / data engineering
- Required event-log schema per event: case_id (job), activity/task name, resource (machine id), timestamp (start/end or single timestamp with lifecycle), lifecycle (start/complete/setup_start/setup_end), operator_id, planned_duration, actual_duration, setup_flag, previous_job_on_resource (if recorded), order_priority, due_date, notes (breakdown, urgent).
- Reconstruct activities: convert lifecycle-start/complete into intervals; if only events per state exist (queue entry, start, end) join by case and activity to produce start/end timestamps.
- Build resource-centric traces: for each machine, sort completed task events by end/start time to reconstruct the exact sequence of jobs processed (this is essential to measure sequence-dependent setups).
- Data quality checks: missing timestamps, duplicate events, overlapping tasks on same resource (indicates log errors), inconsistent planned vs actual durations. Clean or flag for imputation.

B. Process-discovery and control-flow reconstruction
- Use process discovery (e.g., alpha+/heuristic/miner, fuzzy miner for noisy logs) to get the high-level routing topology (common routings, variant frequency).
- Derive per-job routing sequences and compute routing variants (aggregate by frequency): essential in a job shop with high mix to understand most common routings and rare ones.

C. Performance mining metrics and techniques
For each KPI below I describe how to compute it from the log and which process-mining technique to use.

- Job flow times, lead times, makespan distributions
  - Compute flow time per case = timestamp(case completion)  timestamp(case released/arrival).
  - Aggregate distributions: mean, median, pctiles (50/75/90/95), histogram, survival curves (empirical CDF).
  - Makespan for a set of jobs (e.g., daily batch) = max completion  min release. Use boxplots per job family/routing.
  - Use variant-level analysis: compute flow-time distribution conditional on routing variant; identify high-variance variants.

- Task waiting times (queue times) at each machine
  - For each task instance: waiting_time = start_time  queue_entry_time (or start_time  arrival_time if queue_event missing).
  - Aggregate per machine and per time-of-day/week; compute mean, median, pctiles; compute time-series of queue lengths (Little’s Law: Average_WIP = throughput * flow_time) to validate.
  - Visualize via heatmaps (machine vs hour/day) to detect recurring congested periods.

- Resource utilization (machine & operator)
  - For each resource compute: productive_time = sum of task processing durations; setup_time = sum of setup durations; idle_time = total_time_window  productive_time  setup_time  downtime.
  - Utilization = productive_time / available_time; productive+setup utilization = (productive_time + setup_time) / available_time.
  - Use utilization time-series, cumulative histograms, and Gantt-like occupancy plots. Compare utilization across resources to find overloaded vs underused.
  - Also compute throughput per resource (jobs completed/time) and cycle time per job on resource.

- Sequence-dependent setup times
  - Reconstruct ordered pairs for each consecutive task on same machine: (previous_job_id, next_job_id), (previous_job_family, next_job_family), (previous_operation_type, next_operation_type).
  - Compute empirical setup_duration for each transition (previous  next): distribution, mean, std, sample size.
  - Build an n×n transition matrix (or aggregated by family) of mean setup times and of variance. Visualize as heatmap; compute statistics: which preceding job leads to large setups; for which transitions setup variability is highest.
  - Fit parametric / predictive models: regress setup_duration on categorical variables (prev_family, next_family, prev_tool, next_tool, operator) and continuous variables (time since last maintenance, time-of-day). Algorithms: GLM with categorical encodings, random forest, or gradient boosting for non-linear relationships. This yields predictive setup-time estimators usable in scheduling decisions.

- Schedule adherence and tardiness
  - Tardiness per job = max(0, completion_time  due_date). Lateness = completion  due_date (signed).
  - Compute metrics: % on-time, mean tardiness, median tardiness, total tardiness (sum of tardiness weighted by priority), distribution and tail metrics (95th/99th percentile).
  - Compute schedule adherence at activity-level: start-time deviation from plan, end-time deviation.
  - Use variant analysis: compare on-time vs late jobs by routing, job family, machine sequences, and initial release times.

- Impact of disruptions (breakdowns, priority changes)
  - Tag events as disruptive (breakdown_start, unscheduled_maintenance, priority_change/hot_job). For each disruption event, measure before/after KPIs:
    - Short-term: per-resource queue length increase, delayed jobs count, immediate rescheduling events.
    - Medium-term: change in average flow-times for jobs that passed through the affected machine within a time window.
  - Use counterfactual analysis (quasi-experimental): match disrupted intervals to similar non-disrupted intervals by load, routing mix, and time-of-day using propensity scoring; estimate additional delay attributable to breakdown.
  - Use event correlation and root-cause trees: compute cascade effects (how many jobs were rerouted, how many tasks were preempted or rescheduled).
  - Model breakdown dynamics using survival analysis (time-to-failure) or hazard models to predict breakdown likelihood from usage and maintenance logs.

D. Advanced visualization practices
- Process map annotated with frequency and mean waiting times per edge.
- Machine Gantt charts with color-coding for processing/setup/downtime and overlays for hot-jobs and high-priority jobs.
- Transition heatmap for setup matrix.
- Variant dashboards: top 10 routing variants with their average flow times and on-time percentages.
- Resource-concurrency diagrams and “resource load windows” to spot time intervals with simultaneous contention.

2) Diagnosing scheduling pathologies (how to extract evidence)
- Objective: convert mined metrics into definitive evidence about the shop’s inefficiencies and quantify their impact.

A. Common pathologies & evidence you should derive
- Bottleneck identification & impact quantification
  - Evidence: machines with utilization near or above critical threshold (e.g., >85–90%), long average queue times, large variance in queue length, and outsized contribution to average job flow times.
  - Quantify throughput loss: compute the marginal throughput effect by simulating adding capacity vs current baseline (or use Little’s law to estimate required capacity to meet target flow time). Also compute number of jobs delayed whose critical path includes the bottleneck.

- Poor task prioritization harming high-priority jobs
  - Evidence: variant analysis showing high-priority jobs have higher tardiness compared to expected; trace comparisons where urgent jobs were delayed because local dispatching chose FCFS/Earliest Due Date incorrectly (e.g., EDD but ignoring remaining processing time or setup cost).
  - Use decision trees / logistic regression to identify which factors predict whether a job is late; features include dispatch rule outcome, queue length at arrival, setup sequence mismatch, preceding job on resource.

- Suboptimal sequencing increasing setup times
  - Evidence: high total setup time per shift or machine; transition matrix shows large setup times between common transitions; correlation between increased number of setups and increased flow time / tardiness.
  - Compute “avoidable setup time”: compare historical total setup time to minimal possible given optimal grouping by family within the same period (lower-bound estimate) to quantify inefficiency.

- Starvation or blocking of downstream resources
  - Evidence: downstream machines with low utilization and frequent idle periods immediately followed by upstream congestion; time-lagged cross-correlation between upstream queue spikes and downstream idles; example traces showing oscillation (upstream processes dump WIP and then starve downstream).
  - Produce time-series cross-correlations and conditional heatmaps to document cause-effect.

- Bullwhip effect in WIP due to scheduling variability
  - Evidence: compute variance amplification ratio across stages (variance of WIP at stage n relative to stage n-1). High amplification indicates the scheduling decisions upstream are creating large swings downstream.
  - Use moving-window variance analysis to show how small variability in arrivals or processing times is magnified into larger downstream WIP swings.

B. Process-mining techniques to generate this evidence
- Bottleneck analysis: utilization profiles, queue-time aggregates, throughput per resource, topologically critical resources in the discovered control-flow graph (resources on dominant paths).
- Variant analysis: compare routing variants and separate metrics for on-time vs late cases to identify patterns and predictors.
- Resource contention analysis: overlay resource usage heatmaps and compute concurrency metrics (#cases waiting per machine over time).
- Causal attribution for breakdown impacts: before/after matched analysis and survival models to estimate added delays.
- Conformance checking: measure deviation between "planned" (if a plan exists) vs executed traces to quantify schedule instability and frequent rescheduling.

3) Root-cause analysis of scheduling ineffectiveness
- Objective: distinguish between algorithmic/scheduling rule failures vs capacity/variability limitations, and identify actionable root causes.

A. Candidate root causes and how to detect them with process mining
- Static dispatching rules unsuited to dynamic environment
  - Symptom: many near-due-date jobs that were not prioritized; frequent preemption or late scheduling decisions; EDD/FCFS applied consistently yet poor aggregate tardiness.
  - Detection: compute counterfactuals using historical log: simulate alternative dispatch priorities (e.g., SPT, slack-per-work remaining) on historical event order (replay) to estimate what could have been achieved without capacity changes. If large improvements are possible by rule change, the cause is algorithmic.

- Lack of real-time visibility
  - Symptom: delayed reaction to breakdowns/hot-jobs, large reschedule churn, many manual interventions.
  - Detection: find correlations of late responses to events and duration between event occurrence and scheduler action; quantify frequency of manual_override events in log.

- Inaccurate duration and setup time estimates
  - Symptom: wide deviation between planned and actual durations, predictive model shows significant heteroscedasticity.
  - Detection: compute error distributions (actual  planned) by job family, operator, shift; test for systematic bias; build predictive models to quantify explainable variance. Large unexplained variance points to inherent variability.

- Ineffective handling of sequence-dependent setups
  - Symptom: transitions with large setups, frequent switching between families.
  - Detection: identify frequent family switches on bottleneck machines and quantify time lost in setups. If many small lots are processed without grouping, sequencing logic is failing.

- Poor coordination between work centers (lack of lookahead)
  - Symptom: upstream dumping of WIP when downstream congested; scheduling decisions locally optimal but globally suboptimal.
  - Detection: identify cases where local dispatch choice increased downstream queue times via simulation/replay. Compute metrics reflecting local decisions’ negative downstream impact (downstream waiting increase attributable to a particular upstream choice).

- Inadequate emergency handling
  - Symptom: hot jobs cause disproportional schedule disruption; reactive sequencing that increases global tardiness.
  - Detection: analyze the scheduling of hot jobs and the sequence of reschedules and compute total delay caused to other jobs (sum of additional tardiness).

B. Distinguishing scheduling logic vs capacity / variability limitations
- Use two-pronged approach combining process-mined replay simulation and counterfactual experiments:
  1. Replay the historical log in a simulator but replace the scheduling policy with an “oracle” policy (e.g., lookahead optimal or improved heuristics) while keeping resource capacities and stochastic durations identical. Large improvements here indicate algorithmic shortcomings.
  2. Replay using historical scheduling but increase resource capacities (add an identical machine or increase speed) to see improvements. If only capacity increases produce improvements, capacity is limiting.
- Use variance decomposition: explainable variance in tardiness due to scheduling choice vs due to stochastic processing times/breakdowns. For instance, build a regression model for tardiness with features grouped into scheduling-decision features (dispatch rule chosen, ordering) and resource-related features (utilization, breakdown occurrence). Compare R^2 contributions.

4) Developing advanced data-driven scheduling strategies
- Objective: design three concrete, technically-detailed strategies that leverage process mining insights, each addressing specific pathologies and showing expected KPI improvements.

Strategy 1 — Enhanced dynamic dispatching (multi-criteria, lookahead dispatch)
- Core logic
  - Replace simple local rules with a dynamic priority index computed at decision times (machine idle or job arrival). Priority score for job i on machine m:
    Score_i = w1 * SlackIndex_i + w2 * (1 / RemainingProcTime_i)^ + w3 * SetupSaving_i + w4 * DownstreamCongestionPenalty_i + w5 * PriorityTag_i + w6 * StabilityPenalty_i
  - SlackIndex_i = (due_date  now  estimated_remaining_flow_time_to_completion). RemainingProcTime includes predicted processing + predicted setups downstream using the predictive models.
  - SetupSaving_i = estimated reduction in setup time if job i follows the current last job on machine m (computed from the setup transition matrix) relative to worst-case.
  - DownstreamCongestionPenalty_i = estimated expected waiting time at next critical machine(s) if job i enters their queue (use predictive queue length models from process mining).
  - StabilityPenalty_i penalizes frequent preemptions/rescheduling; include a cost for changing previously planned sequences.

- How process mining informs it
  - SetupSaving_i uses the empirically mined transition matrix.
  - RemainingProcTime uses job-family-specific processing-time predictive distributions (see Strategy 2).
  - DownstreamCongestionPenalty uses machine-level queue-time models learned from historical data and current state.
  - Weights (w1..w6) are learned/optimized from historical traces using policy optimization: pick weights that minimize historical tardiness when replaying decisions (grid search/gradient-free or surrogate-based optimization).

- How it addresses pathologies
  - Reduces high tardiness by balancing urgency (slack) and remaining work, avoids perverse prioritization.
  - Reduces unnecessary setups by including setup saving in score.
  - Reduces downstream starvation by internalizing downstream congestion in decision making.

- Expected KPI impact
  - Decrease in % late jobs (especially high-priority) and reduction in average tardiness.
  - Reduced number of costly setups on bottleneck machines leading to improved throughput and lower WIP.
  - More stable schedules (fewer preemptions).

Strategy 2 — Predictive and stochastic scheduling (digital twin + proactive rescheduling)
- Core logic
  - Build predictive models for task durations, setup durations, and failure probabilities (machine breakdown hazard) using the historical log and operator/shift features.
  - Use these models in a short-horizon stochastic scheduler (rolling horizon) that simulates multiple future scenarios (Monte Carlo sampling of durations and breakdowns) to generate robust schedules. The objective can be to minimize expected weighted tardiness +  * expected setups.
  - Provide proactive alerts: identify jobs at high risk of being tardy and suggest preemptive moves (e.g., reroute to alternate machine, move operator, expedite).
  - Incorporate predictive maintenance: when breakdown probability for a machine rises above threshold, schedule maintenance during low-load windows predicted by the digital twin to reduce unscheduled downtime.

- How process mining informs it
  - Duration distributions per operation, per operator, per job family are mined and parametrized; heterogeneity captured (e.g., per operator speed factors).
  - Breakdown modeling: use downtime logs to estimate time-between-failures and hazard functions conditional on cumulative usage, temperature, or last maintenance.
  - Routing likelihoods: process mining provides routing probabilities for stochastic simulation.

- How it addresses pathologies
  - More realistic schedules reduce the frequent deviation from plan (improves schedule adherence).
  - Proactive detection and reallocation can mitigate the impact of breakdowns and hot jobs before they cascade.
  - Using stochastic optimization avoids brittle schedules that assume deterministic times.

- Expected KPI impact
  - Lower variance in lead times (more predictable ETAs).
  - Reduced reactive rescheduling and fewer crisis-induced tardy jobs.
  - Improved utilization stability and reduced emergency maintenance impact.

Strategy 3 — Setup-time optimization and intelligent batching (sequence-optimization at bottlenecks)
- Core logic
  - Identify true bottleneck machines (from mining). For each bottleneck, treat sequencing across a planning horizon as a sequence-dependent setup-cost minimization problem with delivery-time constraints.
  - Two-tier approach:
    1. Batch formation: group arriving jobs into batching windows (e.g., 1–4 hours) by similarity in setup features (family/tool/fixture) and due-date proximity. Use clustering (k-means on encoded features or hierarchical clustering on transition-cost similarity) constrained by due-date urgency (jobs close to due date cannot be delayed beyond slack threshold).
    2. Sequencing within batch: solve a sequence-dependent setup minimization problem with objective: minimize (weighted tardiness +  * total_setup_time). For mid-size batches (<50 jobs) use MIP formulations; otherwise use metaheuristics (simulated annealing, tabu search, or greedy insertion with setup-aware local search). Include the capability to force hot jobs into earlier positions with minimal disruption via swap penalties.

- How process mining informs it
  - Transition cost matrix and variance estimates are inputs to the sequencing objective.
  - Historical family composition and arrival patterns inform optimal batch window sizes and tradeoffs between waiting to batch vs risking tardiness.
  - Use historical counterfactual replay to estimate how often batching would have improved things and by how much.

- How it addresses pathologies
  - Reduces total setup time and setup variance on bottleneck machines, directly improving throughput and reducing average flow time.
  - By optimizing sequencing at the most consequential machines, it focuses effort where the payoff is highest.
  - Helps prevent frequent family-switching and reduces operator/setup resource churn.

- Expected KPI impact
  - Significant reduction in total setup minutes per shift on bottlenecks (potentially 20–50% depending on current state).
  - Reduced average and tail lead times for jobs that pass through optimized machines; reduced WIP due to faster processing.
  - Improved makespan for daily batches and lower machine idle/retool time.

Additional practical measures applicable to all strategies
- Mixed initiative: keep human-in-the-loop for overrides; provide explainability for decisions (why job chosen) using the process-mined features.
- Prioritization policy tied to commercial metrics: incorporate revenue-weighted tardiness to ensure business alignment.
- Phased rollout: pilot bottleneck machine first.

5) Simulation, evaluation, and continuous improvement
- Objective: validate strategies in a risk-free environment, stress-test them, and implement continuous monitoring and adaptation using live logs.

A. Discrete-event simulation (DES) parameterized from process mining
- Inputs from process mining
  - Processing time distributions per (operation, machine, job_family, operator).
  - Setup transition matrix (mean, variance) per machine or per family.
  - Routing probabilities and sequence of operations per job family.
  - Breakdown model: time-to-failure distribution and repair time distribution per machine, conditional on usage.
  - Arrival process: historical arrival rates and variability, including hot-job injection rules.
  - Current shop layout and buffer capacities.

- Simulation experiments to run
  - Baseline: replay current dispatching policy using sampled stochastic inputs to compute expected KPI distributions.
  - Strategy experiments: run each proposed strategy (1–3) individually and combined across many Monte Carlo runs (e.g., 1,000 scenarios) to estimate expected performance and distributional tails.
  - Stress tests:
    - High-load scenario: increase arrival rate to 110–120% typical to measure robustness.
    - Frequent breakdown scenario: double breakdown frequency or increase MTTR.
    - Hot-job scenario: periodic injection of urgent jobs with short due-dates.
    - Operator shortage scenario: remove one operator from shifts.
  - Sensitivity analysis: vary key parameters (setup time reductions, weightings in score, batch window size) to find robust parameter regions.
  - Key outputs to collect: % on-time, average & 95th percentile lead time, mean WIP, throughput, total setup time, number of reschedules, schedule stability metric (fraction of planned operations changed).

- Evaluation metrics & decision criteria
  - Prefer strategies that reduce both mean and tail tardiness (95th percentile).
  - Trade-offs between WIP and utilization: aim to reduce WIP while maintaining or improving throughput.
  - Stability vs optimality: prefer solutions with fewer frequent reschedules (higher human acceptance), unless large KPI gains justify churn.

B. Deployment plan & A/B testing
- Shadow mode: run chosen scheduler in parallel (suggested first on a non-critical machine or for a subset of job families) without changing live dispatch decisions; compare recommended vs executed outcomes.
- Controlled A/B: split workload across two sets of machines or job families; run new strategy on A and baseline on B for an evaluation period.
- KPIs to monitor in pilot: on-time rate, average tardiness, WIP, #setups, machine utilization, operator overtime, number of interventions.

C. Continuous monitoring & adaptation using online process mining
- Streaming process mining infrastructure
  - Continuously ingest MES events and maintain rolling window summaries and models (e.g., last 7, 30, 90 days).
  - Real-time dashboards for KPI tracking and visualizations (process map, queue heatmaps, setup matrix updates).

- Drift detection and automated alerts
  - Statistical tests for drift on distributions: e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov on processing time / setup time distributions; CUSUM or Page-Hinkley on mean lateness.
  - Trigger retraining of predictive models or re-optimization of dispatching weights if significant drift detected.
  - Business rules for human alerts: e.g., if predicted probability of missing >X% orders in next 24 hours > threshold, alarm.

- Closed-loop feedback & policy adaptation
  - Use logs of decisions & outcomes to perform online policy improvement: apply reinforcement learning or bandit-based weight tuning for the dispatch score in Strategy 1 (start conservative; use off-policy evaluation from logs to estimate likely improvement before live changes).
  - Periodic offline model refresh cadence (weekly or biweekly depending on variability) for duration and breakdown models.
  - Maintain an “experiment registry”: keep configuration versions, experiment KPIs, and human feedback so you can roll back if a change degrades performance.

- Governance and human factors
  - Provide operators and supervisors with interpretable recommendations and override capability.
  - Offer training and explainability reports showing why a scheduling decision is better (e.g., “selecting JOB-7023 avoids a 15-min setup and prevents 4 downstream jobs from queuing”).

Implementation considerations and risks
- Data maturity: success depends on accurate timestamps, lifecycle events, and reliable recording of setups and breakdowns. Address missing or noisy data early.
- Computation & latency: some methods (Monte Carlo scheduling) are computationally heavy; use short-horizon stochastic optimization and precomputation (e.g., precomputed lookahead tables) for real-time decisions.
- Organizational buy-in: pilot on a small scale, show measurable improvements, then scale.
- Human-in-the-loop: automatic scheduling should augment, not abruptly replace, experienced planners.

Summary — what you will achieve
- Using the MES event log with process-mining techniques you can:
  - Precisely locate bottlenecks, quantify the cost of sequence-dependent setups, and measure the true causes of tardiness and WIP swings.
  - Distinguish whether problems are due to poor scheduling logic, lack of capacity, or natural variability.
  - Implement three complementary strategies — dynamic multi-criteria dispatching, predictive/stochastic scheduling, and setup-time optimization — that together reduce tardiness, smooth WIP, reduce variability in lead times, and improve utilization.
  - Rigorously validate strategies by DES parameterized from mined data and maintain continuous improvement with online process mining, drift detection, and adaptive retraining.

If you want, I can:
- Propose a prioritized, phased pilot plan (which machines and job families to pilot first),
- Provide example pseudocode for the dispatch priority score and for building the setup transition matrix from the log,
- Or draft the specific simulation experiment designs (input distributions and scenario definitions) ready to hand to your simulation team. Which would you like next?
