###  Explanation of Case Grouping and Activity Naming Logic

####  Case Identification
The raw log shows a **single coherent work session** across multiple applications and documents. Key observations:
- The user starts with **Document1.docx**, edits it, then switches to email, then to a PDF report, then to Excel, returns to Word, and finally edits another document (Quarterly_Report.docx).
- All actions are temporally sequential and occur within a 9-minute window (08:59–09:09).
- There is **no evidence of multiple independent tasks or sessions** (e.g., no distinct start/end markers, no new user login, no unrelated app patterns).
- Switching between apps is logical and part of a workflow (e.g., drafting  checking email  reviewing report  updating budget  revising document).

 Therefore, **all events belong to one case: C001**.

> *Alternative interpretations (e.g., splitting into two cases for Document1 and Quarterly_Report) were considered, but they would break the narrative flow and result in disconnected workflows. The logical sequence shows that the user is working on a single project involving multiple documents and tasks in a structured order.*

---

####  Activity Naming Strategy
Raw events like "FOCUS", "TYPING", "SWITCH", "SCROLL", "HIGHLIGHT" were **translated into meaningful, standardized process activities** that reflect user intent and workflow structure:

| Raw Action | Standardized Activity | Reasoning |
|----------|------------------------|---------|
| FOCUS on a document | Open [Document Name] | Indicates starting work on a file; standard in process mining |
| TYPING with content | Draft [Content Summary] | Reflects content creation; more meaningful than "TYPING" |
| TYPING with specific keys | Insert [Reference/Update] | Indicates specific edits (e.g., budget insert) |
| SAVE | Save [File Name] | Standard process step; vital for process modeling |
| SWITCH to app/window | Switch to [App/Doc] | Captures transitions between tasks; maintains traceability |
| CLICK to open email | Open Email about [Subject] | Provides context; improves interpretability |
| CLICK to reply/send | Reply to Email / Send Email | Clear actions with clear purpose |
| SCROLL / HIGHLIGHT | Scroll [File] / Highlight [Text] | Descriptive of interaction; adds insight into review phase |
| CLOSE | Close [File Name] | Final step in a session; indicates task completion |

> These names are **consistent**, **action-oriented**, and **aligned with common process mining terminology** (e.g., from the *Process Mining with Heuristic Mining* or *Alpha Miner* frameworks).

####  Temporal Consistency
All timestamps are preserved in ISO format. The case is ordered chronologically, reflecting the actual user behavior.

---

###  Final Narrative Summary
The user begins by working on **Document1.docx**, drafting an introduction and saving it. They then check their **email inbox**, reply to a meeting confirmation, and send the email. Next, they open a **PDF report** to review key findings. Afterward, they switch to **Excel** to update budget figures and insert a new row. They return to **Document1.docx** to reference the updated budget, save the changes, and close it. Finally, they open **Quarterly_Report.docx**, draft an executive summary, save it, and close it.

This reflects a **coherent, multi-step document workflow** involving drafting, communication, data review, and cross-document referencing — a typical scenario in office work or report preparation.

###  Suitability for Process Mining Tools
This event log is now:
- **Case-structured** (one case, clear start/end)
- **Activity-rich** (descriptive, high-level)
- **Temporal** (accurate timestamps)
- **Standardized** (consistent naming, no raw actions)

It is fully compatible with tools like **Celonis**, **ProM**, **ProcessMiner**, or **HEURIST** for further analysis (e.g., process discovery, conformance checking, bottleneck detection).
