Let's analyze each case according to the normative rules and desiderata conditions.

### 1. Case Analysis

**Case 1:**

- **Normative Compliance:**  
   - **Sequence Compliance:** Each step follows the required sequence.
   - **Ordering Rules Compliance:** All ordering rules are strictly followed.
   - **Decision Logic:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Activity Finalization:** Documentation is finalized after approval.

**Desiderata Considerations:**
- **Time Window Violation:** Credit Check (09:30) and Risk Assessment (10:00) happened within a 24-hour window after the application. However, informing the applicant (11:00) was delayed beyond the recommended 48 hours.
- **Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call before closing the case.

**Interpretation:** This case mostly adheres to the strict rules but falls short on the desiderata regarding timely communication and a follow-up call.

**Case 2:**

- **Normative Compliance:**  
   - **Sequence Violation:** Risk Assessment (08:00) occurs before Credit Check (09:00), violating the rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
   - **Ordering Rules Violation:** Credit Check before Risk Assessment is violated.
   - **Decision Logic:** Loan decision seems to follow correctly after Risk Assessment.

**Desiderata Considerations:**
- **Time Window Violation:** Both Credit Check and Follow-up Call desiderata are violated due to the timing of these activities.

**Interpretation:** This case clearly violates the normative rules by not following the required sequence and timing recommendations.

**Case 3:**

- **Normative Compliance:**  
   - **Sequence Compliance:** The sequence is followed correctly.
   - **Ordering Rules Compliance:** No ordering rule violation.
   - **Decision Logic:** Correctly applied.
   - **Activity Finalization:** Documentation finalized as expected after approval.

**Desiderata Considerations:**
- **Time Window Violation:** Credit Check (09:00) happened more than 24 hours after the application receipt, violating a desideratum.
- **Follow-up Call Absence:** No follow-up call was performed, violating another desideratum.

**Interpretation:** This case adheres to the strict rules but does not meet the recommended best practices concerning timely credit checks and follow-up calls.

### Summary

1. **Case 1** violates desiderata by delaying the applicant notification beyond 48 hours and failing to conduct a follow-up call, despite following all normative rules strictly.

2. **Case 2** violates normative rules by performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check, which is against the required sequence.

3. **Case 3** also violates desiderata by delaying the credit check beyond 24 hours and omitting a follow-up call, despite following the strict rules correctly.

By analyzing each case according to the specified criteria, we can clearly identify where deviations from both normative rules and desiderata best practices occur, and provide justifications for these behaviors in the context of the given constraints and recommendations.
