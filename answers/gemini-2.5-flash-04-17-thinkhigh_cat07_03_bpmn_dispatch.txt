This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process of dispatching goods within a Computer Hardware Shop. The diagram is structured into three lanes, representing different roles or departments: **Logistics**, **Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop / Secretary**, and **Warehouse**.

The process begins in the "Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop / Secretary" lane with the "Ship goods" event. This triggers two parallel paths.

One path involves clarifying the "shipment method". Depending on whether "Special handling?" is required (represented by a XOR gateway), the process either checks if "insurance is required" (if special handling is needed, indicated by a "yes" flow and a data object representing "Order details"), or proceeds to "Write package label" directly (if special handling is not needed, indicated by a "no" flow). If insurance is required, information from "Customer information" (represented by a data store) is accessed. If insurance is deemed necessary (indicated by a condition flow labeled "If insurance necessary"), the process goes to the "Logistics" lane to "Insure parcel". Regardless of whether insurance is required or not (indicated by a condition flow labeled "always"), the process eventually leads to "Write package label". Following the "Write package label" task, a parallel gateway indicates that the process can proceed in multiple ways.

One of the parallel paths from the "Write package label" task is to another parallel gateway within the "Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop / Secretary" lane. From here, one path involves getting "3 offers from logistic companies" and then selecting a "logistic company and place order". This path eventually merges into a XOR gateway. The other path from the parallel gateway after "Write package label" also merges into this same XOR gateway.

The other initial parallel path from the "Ship goods" event moves to the "Warehouse" lane to "Package goods". This task is associated with an intermediate timer event indicating a delay of "48 hours". If this delay occurs, the process involves notifying the "customer about delay". This path then merges into a parallel gateway within the "Warehouse" lane.

The XOR gateway in the "Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop / Secretary" lane merges into a parallel gateway in the "Warehouse" lane.

From the parallel gateway in the "Warehouse" lane, the process proceeds to "Fill out Shipment paperwork". Following this, the task is to "Move package to pickup area". Finally, the process concludes with the "Shipment prepared" end event.
