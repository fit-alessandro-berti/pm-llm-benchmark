**Task 1 Answer:**  
A valid trace under the model but invalid per domain logic is:  
`[Receive Order, Check Inventory, Cancel Order, Close Order, Close Order]`.

**Task 2 Explanation:**  
The model's structure forces `Close Order` to occur outside the XOR node's branches. In the cancellation path, the `cancel_subtree` already includes `Close Order`, and the root's sequence appends another `Close Order`. This results in **duplicate `Close Order` events** in the trace. While the model treats this as valid, domain rules specify `Close Order` should execute **only once** after all actions (either successful completion or cancellation). The duplication violates the "one-time closure" requirement, making the trace logically inconsistent despite adhering to the model's.
