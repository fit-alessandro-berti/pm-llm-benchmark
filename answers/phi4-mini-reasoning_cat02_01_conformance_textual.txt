Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process outlined here. From what I gather, there's a standard flow for handling orders based on inventory availability.

The process starts with "Receive order." Then, regardless of anything else, they must check inventory before making any decisions about payment or fulfillment. If inventory is sufficient, then proceed to authorize payment (making sure payment method is valid), package items, ship the order, and finally close the order. Each step here has a specific sequence: Check inventory  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close.

If checking inventory shows insufficient stock, the process should go into cancellation mode. So after "Check inventory," they immediately cancel the order. Then once canceled, you can proceed to "Close order." The key points are that authorization can't happen before checking inventory, shipping can't occur if there's a cancellation prior, and close is always last.

Now, looking at each case in the event log:

Case 1: Receives order, checks inventory (okay), authorizes payment, packages, ships, closes. This follows both paths for sufficient inventory correctly. So no violations here.

Case 2: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close. Wait a minute. The problem here is that they checked the inventory but then packaged items before authorizing payment. According to the normative process, after checking inventory (which was presumably sufficient), you must authorize payment next before packaging. So in Case 2, even if inventory is enough, they're doing Package before Authorize Payment. That's a violation because authorization should come right after inventory check.

Case 3: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close? Wait no. Let me check again. The activities are: Check inventory (okay), then Authorize payment. But wait, if the inventory is sufficient here. However, in this case, after authorizing payment and shipping items immediately without checking whether the authorization was valid or not—wait, but according to the process, once you authorize payment, you package items before shipping. Wait no: the correct sequence for sufficient inventory should be Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. But Case 3 does Check (sufficient?), then Authorize immediately, skips packaging and goes straight to Ship? So after authorizing payment but not packaging first. That's a violation because "Package items" must come right after authorization before shipping.

Wait, the process says: if inventory is sufficient, next steps are authorize payment, package, ship, close. But in Case 3, they did Check  Authorize  ... then Ship without Package. So that's invalid. Also, even more problematic: what about cancellation? Wait, no, because after checking inventory here (assuming it's sufficient), but maybe the check showed insufficient? Because in their case, after authorizing payment and shipping immediately. But if inventory was sufficient when they checked, why did they authorize payment without packaging? So that's a violation.

Case 4: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. This seems okay for insufficient inventory. They checked, found not enough stock (since canceled next), then canceled and closed. No issues here as per the process description.

Case 5: All steps in order again. Receive, check inventory (sufficient?), authorize payment after some time, package, ship, close. So this follows the correct sequence for sufficient inventory. Wait, but there's a timestamp gap between Check and Authorize. The problem is not about timing gaps, just the order of activities. Since Case 5 does receive, then check (assuming inventory was sufficient), then later authorize payment. But in their log, after checking at 10:00, they have authorizing at 10:30. So even with a gap, as long as the sequence is correct, it's okay? The description doesn't mention timing constraints beyond order of steps, so gaps are allowed. Therefore, Case 5 follows correctly.

So summarizing:

Violations:

Case 2: Package before Authorize Payment (should be Check  Authorize  Package)

Case 3: After checking inventory (which was sufficient?), they authorized payment but then shipped without packaging first. So the sequence should have been Authorize  Package  Ship, so shipping after authorization without packaging is a violation.

Wait, in Case 3: Let's check again. The activities are:

Receive order at 09:00

Check inventory at 09:20 (assuming sufficient here)

Authorize payment at 09:40

Cancel order at 10:00

Ship order at 11:00

Close order at 11:30.

Wait, here's the problem. After checking inventory and finding it sufficient (since they proceeded to authorize payment), but then after authorizing payment, instead of packaging items, they checked again? Wait no, in Case 3, after Check inventory, next is Authorize Payment. But according to the process, if inventory was sufficient, you should have authorization first, then package, ship, close. However, in this case, after checking (sufficient), authorizing payment but not packaging items before shipping. Then at some point (maybe they found out that stock wasn't enough?), they canceled and shipped. Wait no—Case 3's inventory check shows sufficient? Because if it was insufficient when checked, then why did they proceed to authorize payment?

Wait the problem here is ambiguous. The description says "Check inventory" must occur before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment are made. So once you check inventory (whether sufficient or not), but in Case 3: after checking at 09:20, if that was sufficient, then why did they proceed to authorize payment? But the problem arises when after authorizing payment and packaging items, which didn't happen here—they went straight from Check to Authorize, skipped Package, shipped. Wait no—the sequence for insufficient inventory is Check  Cancel  Close. For sufficient inventory: Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close.

In Case 3: After checking (sufficient?), they authorize payment but then immediately cancel? No, in the activities listed, after check and authorization comes "Cancel order". So maybe during processing of authorizing payment, there's some issue that wasn't mentioned. But according to the process description, if inventory was sufficient when checked, you should proceed with Authorize  Package  Ship  Close.

But in Case 3: After Check (assuming sufficient), they did Authorize Payment at 09:40. Then next activity is Cancel order at 10:00. Wait that's impossible because after authorization comes the expectation to package items before shipping. But here, instead of packaging, they're canceling? That would mean that even though inventory was initially checked as sufficient (but perhaps later found insufficient?), but according to process rules, once you authorize payment and then decide not to proceed with fulfillment steps, maybe that's allowed?

Wait no—according to the description: if after checking inventory it's sufficient, all must go through Authorize  Package  Ship. But in Case 3, they did Check (sufficient), then Authorize Payment but skipped Package, then canceled? That doesn't make sense because canceling would imply insufficient stock at that point. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait the problem says "if inventory check reveals not enough stock to fulfill order", branch into cancellation. But in Case 3: after checking (sufficient?), they authorize payment and then later find out it's actually insufficient? No, but according to the process rules, once you have checked inventory (even if that was sufficient), any subsequent decision would need another check unless there's a reason given by the description.

But the normative text doesn't mention re-checking inventory after authorization. So in Case 3: After Check (sufficient?), then Authorize Payment—but without packaging items first—then later decide to cancel? That violates the process because you shouldn't skip Package step even if for some internal reason they want to cancel afterwards. The description states that once authorized payment, items must be packaged before shipping. So in Case 3: after Check (sufficient), authorizing but not packaging, then cancelling and trying to ship—this is a violation.

But wait, the problem arises when you have "Cancel order" activity occurring between Authorize Payment and Ship Order? According to the insufficient inventory path, once you check inventory finds insufficient, cancel immediately. But in Case 3: after Check (sufficient?), they proceed to authorize payment but then decide to do Cancel instead of Package before Ship.

So this is a violation because for sufficient inventory, must follow Authorize  Package  Ship. So even if later on the stock becomes unavailable due to some other reason not covered by the process description, according to the given rules, once you authorized payment and skipped package step (which isn't allowed), then any subsequent cancellation would be invalid.

Thus, Case 3 is violating because after checking inventory they should have done Authorize  Package  Ship. But instead, they did Check  Authorize Payment without Packaging first, which violates the process sequence for sufficient inventory cases.

Additionally, in Case 4: Receive order, check inventory (finds insufficient), cancel, then close. This follows the insufficient path correctly. So no violation here.

Case 5 is correct as per the sufficient inventory flow.

So violations are Cases 2 and 3.

Wait but let's re-examine each case:

Case 2: After Check inventory (assuming it's okay to proceed?), they Package items before Authorizing payment. That's a direct violation because authorization must come after checking, regardless of sufficiency. Wait no—the process says "Check inventory" is mandatory first step. But the next steps depend on sufficiency.

Wait in Case 2:

Activities: Receive  Check (assuming sufficient)  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close.

But according to the normative process, if inventory was sufficient after check, then must have Authorization before Packaging? Wait no—the correct sequence for sufficient is: Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. So in Case 2, they did Check  Package (before authorization). That's a violation because even though inventory might be sufficient, but the order of steps requires that authorization comes next after check.

So regardless of sufficiency level? Wait no—the process says "Check inventory" must always occur before any decisions about payment or fulfillment. So after checking inventory—whether sufficient or not—you can't do anything else except decide on path (fulfillment vs cancellation). But according to the description, if sufficient, proceed with Authorize  Package  Ship; if insufficient, cancel.

So in Case 2: Check is done first (sufficient), then they Package items before doing Authorize payment. That's a violation because after checking inventory sufficiency, you must authorize payment next. So even though packaging might seem logical for fulfillment steps, according to the process description, authorization comes immediately after check and only after that can packing happen.

Therefore, Case 2 is violating by Packaging before Authorization.

Case 3: After Check (assuming sufficient), they Authorize Payment but then skip Package step and instead Cancel. But why would they cancel? According to the rules, if inventory was checked as sufficient at that time, cancellation shouldn't be triggered unless there's a new reason for insufficiency not covered in the original check. However, according to the given process description, once you have authorized payment (even though later stock might run out), you're supposed to package before shipping. But here they canceled instead of packaging first.

So Case 3's sequence is: Check  Authorize Payment (without doing Package) then Cancel and Ship—this violates because for sufficient inventory cases, must do Authorize  Package  Ship. So skipping Package step even after authorization but not finding insufficiency at check time would be invalid under the given rules.

Therefore, violations are Cases 2 and 3.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Case ID 2 Violation:**  
   - **Activities Sequence:** `Receive  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`.  
   - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," violating the normative process for sufficient inventory (which requires `Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items`). The authorization step must precede packaging to ensure payment validity prior to fulfillment actions.  

2. **Case ID 3 Violation:**  
   - **Activities Sequence:** `Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order`.  
   - **Violation:** After "Check inventory" and "Authorize payment," the process skips "Package items" (required before shipping) and proceeds to cancel. Even if the initial check implied sufficient stock, authorization followed by cancellation without fulfilling packaging violates the sequence for fulfillment paths. Further, "Ship order" occurs after a prior cancellation ("Cancel order"), which is invalid as shipping must always follow fulfillment steps (`Package  Ship`) or only occur in non-canceled cases.

---

**Final Answer:**  
Cases **2 and 3** violate the normative process:  

- **Case 2** packages items before authorizing payment, bypassing the mandatory `Check inventory  Authorize payment` sequence.  
- **Case 3** cancels an order after authorization without packaging (skipping "Package items"), then illegally ships it post-cancellation.  

Both cases violate the rule that fulfillment steps (Authorize, Package, Ship) must follow a confirmed sufficient inventory check and cannot be interrupted by cancellation or reversed once payment is authorized.
