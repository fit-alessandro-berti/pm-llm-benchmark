#### **Sequence Flow**
1. **Receive Invoice**
   - The process starts when an invoice is received, usually by email.

2. **Check for Purchase Order (PO) Number**
   - If the invoice does not have a PO number, it is sent back to the supplier requesting more details.
   - If the invoice has a PO number, proceed to the next step.

3. **Log Invoice in Accounting System**
   - The invoice is logged into the accounting system.

4. **Forward Invoice to Purchasing**
   - The invoice is forwarded to the Purchasing Department to confirm the receipt of goods or services.

5. **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**
   - Purchasing Department verifies if the goods or services were received as per the PO.
   - If the PO number is missing, Purchasing alerts Accounts Payable to obtain this information.

6. **Match Invoice to PO**
   - The invoice line items are matched against the PO in the system.
   - If everything matches, proceed to the next step.
   - If there is a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items), contact the Purchasing Department to clarify.

7. **Resolve Discrepancies**
   - If the discrepancy can be resolved, proceed to the next step.
   - If the discrepancy cannot be resolved easily, escalate to the supervisor.

8. **Escalate to Supervisor**
   - The supervisor tries to contact suppliers or coordinate between departments to resolve the issue.
   - If the invoice does not match any PO, work with department heads to create a retrospective PO or decide if the invoice should be rejected.
   - Once resolved, the invoice goes back to the normal flow.

9. **Manager Approval**
   - The system sends an automatic email requesting the manager’s sign-off.
   - The manager reviews the invoice details, PO, and confirmation.
   - If all looks good, the manager approves.
   - If there are issues, the manager may reject or ask Accounts Payable to hold and investigate further.

10. **Schedule Payment**
    - After manager approval, the invoice is scheduled for payment.
