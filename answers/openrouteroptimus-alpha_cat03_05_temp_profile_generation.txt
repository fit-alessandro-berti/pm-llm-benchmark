**Notes:**
- Times are estimated in **seconds** (e.g., 86400 = 1 day).
- This dictionary includes immediate, intermediate, and distant relationships to represent process complexity.
- Standard deviations reflect greater variance for longer process steps or those influenced by external factors (e.g., global distribution).
- Not every possible pair is included, but the subset provides broad and meaningful coverage for temporal profiling in a real-world supply chain execution.
