# Explanation:
# The added constraints to the `updated_declare_model` serve as mechanisms to mitigate potential bias in the loan application process.
# - **Coexistence Constraint** (`CheckApplicantRace` and `ManualReview`): Ensures that for any applicant whose race is checked, a manual review must also be carried out. This step ensures human oversight before any potentially sensitive decisions are made regarding applicants of minority races.
# - **Response/Succession Constraints**: The constraint from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck` indicates that an additional check for bias mitigation should follow the identification of a candidate's race, ensuring no immediate decision is taken based solely on racial information without further review. This step ensures fairness by adding a procedural step before final decisions.
# - **Non-succession Constraint**: The constraint from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject` indicates that it is not acceptable for an applicant's application to be directly rejected after their race has been checked, thus preventing discriminatory decision-making based on racial identification. This ensures that all applicants receive equitable consideration regardless of their racial background.
```

This solution incorporates new DECLARE constraints into the original model with a clear rationale for each added constraint designed to mitigate bias in loan application decisions based on sensitive attributes such as race or gender. The constraints ensure fair and transparent decision-making processes by mandating additional checks and human oversight where necessary, particularly before making critical decisions that could affect applicants from potentially disadvantaged groups.
