### **Process Mining Analysis of Manufacturing Event Log**

After analyzing the event log, I identified **five distinct activity phases** based on sensor patterns. Below is the grouping of events into activities, along with the rationale for each label.

---

### **1. Idle / Machine Standby**
**Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** ~20–21°C (room temperature)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (baseline)
- **Vibration:** 0 Hz (no movement)
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s (no input)
- **Tool Position:** 0 mm (retracted)
- **Energy Consumption:** 0.40–0.50 kWh (low, baseline power)

**Rationale:**
- The machine is not performing any operation.
- All sensor readings are at baseline levels, indicating no active processing.
- This likely represents **downtime, setup, or waiting for input material**.

### **2. Cutting Metal**
**Events:** 4, 5, 6
**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** 50–58°C (moderate increase due to friction)
- **Pressure:** 1–1.5 bar (slight increase)
- **Vibration:** 30–38 Hz (high, due to cutting motion)
- **Material Flow:** 5 units/s (material being fed into the cutter)
- **Tool Position:** 5–10 mm (tool engaged)
- **Energy Consumption:** 2.00–3.00 kWh (moderate power draw)

**Rationale:**
- The **sharp increase in vibration and temperature** suggests a cutting operation.
- **Material flow is active**, meaning raw material is being processed.
- **Tool position changes**, indicating movement along a cutting path.
- **Energy consumption is elevated** but not extreme, consistent with a cutting tool.

### **3. Welding**
**Events:** 9
**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** 80°C (high, due to welding heat)
- **Pressure:** 2 bar (slightly elevated)
- **Vibration:** 50 Hz (very high, due to welding arc or laser)
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s (no material movement during welding)
- **Tool Position:** 15 mm (stationary, focused on a joint)
- **Energy Consumption:** 5.00 kWh (very high, typical for welding)

**Rationale:**
- **Extremely high temperature and energy consumption** are hallmarks of welding.
- **No material flow** suggests the machine is holding parts in place.
- **High vibration** could indicate an arc welder or laser in operation.
- **Tool position is fixed**, meaning the machine is applying heat to a specific spot.

---

### **4. Quality Inspection / Cooling**
**Events:** 7, 8, 10
**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** 30–40°C (cooling down after welding/cutting)
- **Pressure:** 1–2 bar (moderate)
- **Vibration:** 1–10 Hz (low, minimal movement)
- **Material Flow:** 0–2 units/s (slow or stopped)
- **Tool Position:** 15 mm (stationary)
- **Energy Consumption:** 1.00–2.00 kWh (reduced from welding/cutting)

**Rationale:**
- **Temperature drops significantly** after welding/cutting, suggesting cooling.
- **Low vibration and material flow** indicate no active processing.
- **Tool position is fixed**, meaning the machine is likely scanning or inspecting the part.
- **Moderate energy use** could power sensors (e.g., cameras, lasers) for quality checks.

---

### **5. Assembling Parts**
**Events:** 11, 12
**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** 25°C (room temperature)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (baseline)
- **Vibration:** 5 Hz (low, precise movements)
- **Material Flow:** 1 unit/s (slow, controlled feed)
- **Tool Position:** 20 mm (moving, likely positioning parts)
- **Energy Consumption:** 1.50–1.60 kWh (moderate, steady)

**Rationale:**
- **Low vibration and steady material flow** suggest precise, controlled movements.
- **Tool position changes**, indicating part placement or fastening.
- **No significant temperature or pressure changes**, meaning no heat-intensive processes.
- **Energy use is stable**, typical for robotic assembly.

### **Summary of Labeled Activities**

| **Activity**            | **Events**       | **Key Sensor Indicators** |
|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Idle / Standby**      | 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15 | Low temp, no vibration, no flow, tool retracted |
| **Cutting Metal**       | 4, 5, 6          | High vibration, moderate temp, material flow, tool engaged |
| **Welding**             | 9                | Very high temp & energy, high vibration, no flow, fixed tool |
| **Quality Inspection**  | 7, 8, 10         | Cooling temp, low vibration, minimal flow, fixed tool |
| **Assembling Parts**    | 11, 12           | Low vibration, steady flow, tool movement, moderate energy |

### **Process Flow Inference**
Based on the sequence of events, the **likely manufacturing process** is:
1. **Idle** (waiting for input)
2. **Cutting Metal** (preparing parts)
3. **Welding** (joining parts)
4. **Quality Inspection** (cooling & checking)
5. **Assembling Parts** (final assembly)
6. **Idle** (process complete)

This aligns with a **typical metal fabrication workflow**, where raw material is cut, welded, inspected, and assembled before packaging (not shown in this log).
