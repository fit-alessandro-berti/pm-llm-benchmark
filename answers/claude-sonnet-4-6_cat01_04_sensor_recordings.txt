# Process Mining Analysis: Manufacturing Assembly Line Event Log

## Step 1: Exploratory Pattern Recognition

Before assigning labels, I'll map out the key sensor trends across all 15 events to visually identify phase transitions:

```
Event |  Temp  | Pressure | Vibration | Flow | Tool Pos | Energy
------|--------|----------|-----------|------|----------|-------
1-3   |  20-21 |    1     |     0     |  0   |    0     | 0.40-0.50
4-6   |  50-58 |   1-1.5  |   30-38   |  5   |   5-10   | 2.00-3.00
7-8   |   40   |    2     |    10     |  2   |   15     | 2.00
9     |   80   |    2     |    50     |  0   |   15     | 5.00
10    |   30   |    1     |     1     |  0   |   15     | 1.00
11-12 |   25   |    1     |     5     |  1   |   20     | 1.50-1.60
13-15 |  20-21 |    1     |     0     |  0   |    0     | 0.40-0.50

## Step 2: Phase Identification & Clustering

I can identify **5 distinct phases** based on inflection points in the sensor data:

## Step 3: Labeled Activities with Rationale

---

###  Phase 1 — Events 1–3: **"Machine Idle / Standby"**

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Temperature | 20–21°C | Ambient room temperature — no heat-generating process active |
| Pressure | 1 bar | Baseline atmospheric pressure — no pressurized systems engaged |
| Vibration | 0 Hz | Zero mechanical activity |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s | No material being processed or transported |
| Tool Position | 0 mm | Tool in home/rest position |
| Energy | 0.40–0.50 kWh | Minimal baseline draw (control systems, sensors only) |

**Rationale:**  
All readings are at their minimum baseline values. The near-zero energy consumption, zero vibration, zero material flow, and tool resting at position 0 mm collectively indicate that the machine is **powered on but not performing any work**. This is a classic idle or standby state, commonly observed at the start of a production cycle before operations commence.

---

###  Phase 2 — Events 4–6: **"Cutting Metal"**

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Temperature | 50–58°C | Rapid rise due to friction between cutting tool and workpiece |
| Pressure | 1.0–1.5 bar | Slight increase as cutting tool engages material |
| Vibration | 30–38 Hz | High vibration characteristic of mechanical cutting/machining |
| Material Flow | 5 units/s | Consistent high flow — raw material being fed into cutting zone |
| Tool Position | 510 mm | Progressive tool advancement through material |
| Energy | 2.00–3.00 kWh | Significant and rising energy draw from cutting motor |

**Rationale:**  
This phase shows the most dramatic multi-variable change from the baseline. The **simultaneous spike in temperature, vibration, and energy** — combined with **steady high material flow** and **progressive tool advancement** — is the signature pattern of a **cutting or machining operation**. The friction from a rotating/reciprocating cutting tool against metal generates heat (50–58°C) and vibration (30–38 Hz). The tool moving from 5mm to 10mm indicates it is **traversing through material**. The energy ramp from 2.0 to 3.0 kWh reflects increasing cutting resistance as the tool penetrates deeper.

---

###  Phase 3 — Events 7–8: **"Assembling Parts"**

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Temperature | 40°C | Moderately elevated — residual heat from cutting, plus light mechanical work |
| Pressure | 2 bar | Increased pressure — consistent with pressing/fitting components together |
| Vibration | 10 Hz | Low-moderate vibration — controlled mechanical movement, not aggressive |
| Material Flow | 2 units/s | Reduced but non-zero — components being positioned/moved |
| Tool Position | 15 mm | Tool has advanced further — holding/pressing position |
| Energy | 2.00 kWh | Stable moderate consumption — steady mechanical work without spikes |

**Rationale:**  
After cutting, the readings stabilize at **moderate and steady levels** — a key indicator of a **controlled, deliberate assembly operation**. The **elevated pressure (2 bar)** suggests a clamping, pressing, or fastening action used when fitting parts together. The **low-moderate vibration (10 Hz)** indicates mechanical movement without the aggressive oscillation of cutting. The **stable tool position at 15 mm** (held constant across both events) suggests the tool is **holding or pressing parts in a fixed configuration**. The steady energy consumption without spikes points to a **repetitive, controlled motion** rather than high-energy machining.

---

###  Phase 4 — Event 9: **"Welding"**

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Temperature | 80°C | Sharp peak — highest temperature in the entire log |
| Pressure | 2 bar | Maintained pressure — workpiece held firmly during weld |
| Vibration | 50 Hz | Peak vibration — arc/plasma instability or weld pool dynamics |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s | Zero flow — no raw material fed; only heat being applied |
| Tool Position | 15 mm | Unchanged — torch/electrode held at fixed weld point |
| Energy | 5.00 kWh | Maximum energy — highest in entire log, consistent with arc welding |

**Rationale:**  
Event 9 is the most distinctive single event in the log. The **extreme temperature spike to 80°C**, **peak energy consumption of 5.0 kWh**, and **highest vibration at 50 Hz** — all occurring while **material flow drops to zero** and the **tool remains stationary at 15 mm** — form a pattern that is highly characteristic of **welding**. Welding requires intense, localized heat generation (arc or resistance welding) without material feed, which explains the zero flow rate. The tool stays fixed because the welding torch or electrode must be **held at a precise point** on the joint. The pressure remaining at 2 bar suggests the previously assembled parts are clamped together during the weld. The energy spike to 5.0 kWh reflects the enormous power demand of an electric arc or resistance welding process.

###  Phase 5 — Events 10–12: **"Quality Inspection"**

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Temperature | 25–30°C | Rapid cooldown — process heat dissipating, no new heat source |
| Pressure | 1 bar | Returns to baseline — no mechanical force applied |
| Vibration | 1–5 Hz | Near-zero vibration — minimal mechanical activity |
| Material Flow | 0–1 units/s | Very low — part moving slowly through inspection zone |
| Tool Position | 1520 mm | Slight tool movement — probe/sensor scanning the workpiece |
| Energy | 1.00–1.60 kWh | Low consumption — consistent with sensors, cameras, or probes |

**Rationale:**  
After welding, the process enters a **cool-down and evaluation phase**. The temperature drops sharply (80°C  30°C  25°C), pressure returns to ambient (1 bar), and vibration is nearly zero. The **small, deliberate tool movement from 15mm to 20mm** combined with very **low energy consumption (1.0–1.6 kWh)** suggests a **measurement or scanning instrument** — such as a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) probe, ultrasonic tester, or optical sensor — **moving across the finished workpiece**. The minimal material flow (0–1 units/s) indicates the part is either stationary or moving very slowly on a conveyor beneath an inspection system. This pattern — low energy, near-zero vibration, slight positional movement, cooling temperature — is the hallmark of a **post-process quality check**.

---

###  Phase 6 — Events 13–15: **"Machine Idle / Standby"** *(Cycle Reset)*

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Temperature | 20–21°C | Full return to ambient temperature |
| Pressure | 1 bar | Baseline pressure restored |
| Vibration | 0 Hz | Zero mechanical activity |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s | No material movement |
| Tool Position | 0 mm | Tool returned to home position |
| Energy | 0.40–0.50 kWh | Identical to Phase 1 baseline |

**Rationale:**  
All readings are **identical to Phase 1 (Events 1–3)**, confirming this is a **machine reset to idle state** after completing one full production cycle. The tool returning to **position 0 mm** is particularly significant — it confirms an intentional **home position reset**, suggesting the machine has completed its programmed cycle and is ready to begin the next one.
