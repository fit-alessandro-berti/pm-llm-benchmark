To infer the case groupings from the given sequence of events, we need to identify patterns and logical sequences of activities that correspond to individual patient journeys. Here’s a logical breakdown of the events into separate cases based on timing, departments, and patient-specific activities:

### Case 1
This case involves a patient who is registered, undergoes initial triage, receives an X-ray, and is discharged.

1. **Register patient** (event 1): Patient Age 45, Gender M, Insurance: Private
2. **Initial triage** (event 4): Triage Code 3
3. **X-ray imaging** (event 7): Body Part: Left Leg
4. **Doctor consultation** (event 12): Diagnosis: Hairline Fracture
5. **Prescription created** (event 14): Medication: Antibiotics
6. **Patient discharged** (event 15): Follow-up: Outpatient Clinic

**Case 1 Patient:** 45 years old, male, private insurance

### Case 2
This case involves a patient who is registered, undergoes initial triage, has lab tests, gets surgery preparation, and is discharged.

1. **Register patient** (event 2): Patient Age 62, Gender F, Insurance: Public
2. **Initial triage** (event 5): Triage Code 2
3. **Lab test requested** (event 6): Test Type: Blood Panel
4. **Lab test completed** (event 10): Results: Normal Levels
5. **Doctor consultation** (event 11): Diagnosis: Minor Infection
6. **Surgery preparation** (event 9): Prep Type: General Anesthesia
7. **Surgery performed** (event 13): Procedure: Arthroscopy
8. **Patient discharged** (event 17): Follow-up: Pharmacy Pickup

**Case 2 Patient:** 62 years old, female, public insurance

### Case 3
This case involves a patient who is registered, undergoes initial triage, has surgery preparation, and is discharged after surgery.

1. **Register patient** (event 3): Patient Age 28, Gender M, Insurance: Private
2. **Initial triage** (event 4): Triage Code 3
3. **Doctor consultation** (event 6): Reason: Scheduled Knee Surgery
4. **Surgery preparation** (event 9): Prep Type: General Anesthesia
5. **Surgery performed** (event 13): Procedure: Arthroscopy
6. **Recovery room** (event 16): Condition: Stable
7. **Patient discharged** (event 18): Follow-up: Physiotherapy Sessions

**Case 3 Patient:** 28 years old, male, private insurance

### Summary of Case Grouping
- **Case 1:** Patient Age 45, Gender M, Insurance: Private
- **Case 2:** Patient Age 62, Gender F, Insurance: Public
- **Case 3:** Patient Age 28, Gender M, Insurance: Private

Each case is identified by the sequence of events, patient attributes, and the logical flow of activities within each patient’s journey through the hospital.
