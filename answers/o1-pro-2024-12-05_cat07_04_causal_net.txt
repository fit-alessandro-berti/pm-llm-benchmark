This visualization is depicting a workflow process as a Petri-net-like model (often called a workflow net), along with a legend explaining different control-flow constructs such as XOR-splits, XOR-joins, AND-splits, AND-joins, OR-splits, and OR-joins.

**Key Elements:**

1. **Activities (Square Boxes with Letters):**  
   Each large square box labeled with a letter (e.g., a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, z) represents an activity or task that can be performed in the process. These activities have meaningful names:
   - **a:** "register request"
   - **b:** "examine thoroughly"
   - **c:** "examine casually"
   - **d:** "check ticket"
   - **e:** "decide"
   - **f:** "reinitiate request"
   - **g:** "pay compensation"
   - **h:** "reject request"
   - **z:** "end"

2. **Places (Small Black Circles):**  
   The small black dots represent conditions or states in the workflow. In Petri nets, these are called "places." They function as markers that show which steps can occur next. A place can be thought of as a "state" that enables transitions (activities) to start.

3. **Arcs (Arrows):**  
   The arrows connecting the places to the activities (and vice versa) define the possible sequence of steps. An activity can only occur if all of its input places are marked, and once it occurs, it "consumes" the tokens from input places and "produces" tokens in output places, enabling subsequent activities.

4. **Control-Flow Patterns (Legend in the Inset):**  
   The inset at the bottom-right shows different routing constructs used in workflow nets. These constructs explain how tokens split and merge at certain points:
   - **XOR-split:** One input leads to exactly one of several possible outputs (exclusive choice).
   - **AND-split:** One input leads to multiple outputs occurring in parallel.
   - **OR-split:** One input leads to one or more outputs, depending on conditions (non-exclusive choice).
   - **XOR-join:** Out of multiple incoming paths, only one path needs to have a token before continuing.
   - **AND-join:** All incoming paths need to have tokens before the activity can proceed.
   - **OR-join:** One or more incoming paths having tokens is sufficient to proceed, potentially waiting to see if other paths also become available.

In this particular workflow, starting with activity **a** ("register request"), the process can move through different pathsâ€”some activities (b, c, d, f) represent various ways to examine or reinitiate a request. The activity **e** ("decide") is a key point where the next step might be to either proceed to paying compensation (**g**) or rejecting the request (**h**), eventually leading to the end state (**z**).

By showing these patterns, the diagram illustrates how complex processes can be structured and analyzed using workflow nets. The overall idea is to visually represent possible paths through a process, the conditions under which certain steps occur, and the synchronization or splitting of parallel or exclusive branches.
