### **Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Times**

#### **1. Identifying Cases with Longer Resolution Times**
To determine which cases took significantly longer to resolve, we calculate the **total resolution time** for each case by subtracting the timestamp of the first event ("Receive Ticket") from the timestamp of the last event ("Close Ticket").

| Case ID | Receive Ticket Timestamp | Close Ticket Timestamp | Total Resolution Time |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00         | 2024-03-01 10:15       | **2 hours 15 minutes** |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05         | 2024-03-02 09:15       | **25 hours 10 minutes** |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10         | 2024-03-01 09:30       | **1 hour 20 minutes** |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20         | 2024-03-02 08:30       | **24 hours 10 minutes** |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25         | 2024-03-03 09:30       | **55 hours 5 minutes** |

**Observations:**
- **Cases 102, 104, and 105** have significantly longer resolution times (24+ hours) compared to **Cases 101 and 103** (under 3 hours).
- **Case 105** is the worst performer, taking **55 hours** to resolve.

#### **2. Determining Root Causes of Delays**
We analyze the event logs for **Cases 102, 104, and 105** to identify patterns contributing to delays:

##### **Case 102 (25h 10m)**
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent (11:30 AM on Day 1)**  **Investigation (2:00 PM on Day 1)**  **Resolution (9:00 AM on Day 2)**
  - **Key Issue:** Long delay (4.5 hours) between escalation and investigation.
  - **Possible Causes:**
    - Level-2 Agent availability issues.
    - Backlog or prioritization delays.

##### **Case 104 (24h 10m)**
- **Investigation (1:00 PM on Day 1)**  **Resolution (8:00 AM on Day 2)**
  - **Key Issue:** Overnight delay (19 hours) between investigation and resolution.
  - **Possible Causes:**
    - Agent unavailability (e.g., end of shift, no immediate follow-up).
    - Complex issue requiring additional time.

##### **Case 105 (55h 5m)**
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent (10:00 AM on Day 1)**  **Investigation (2:00 PM on Day 2)**  **Resolution (9:00 AM on Day 3)**
  - **Key Issues:**
    - **1-day delay (16 hours) between escalation and investigation.**
    - **Additional 1-day delay (22 hours) between investigation and resolution.**
  - **Possible Causes:**
    - Severe backlog or resource constraints in Level-2.
    - Multiple handoffs or unclear ownership.

#### **3. Proposed Insights & Recommendations**
##### **Key Bottlenecks:**
1. **Escalation Delays:**
   - Cases involving escalations (102, 105) experience significant delays between escalation and investigation.
   - **Solution:** Implement **SLA tracking for escalations** and ensure Level-2 agents prioritize urgent cases.

2. **Overnight Delays (Case 104):**
   - Long gaps between investigation and resolution suggest **lack of immediate follow-up**.
   - **Solution:** Assign **on-call agents** or enforce **same-day resolution policies** for critical issues.

3. **Unnecessary Waiting Times:**
   - Some cases (e.g., 105) have **multiple delays** without clear justification.
   - **Solution:** Introduce **automated alerts** for stalled tickets and enforce **time-bound SLAs**.

4. **Resource Constraints:**
   - Level-2 agents may be overloaded, causing delays.
   - **Solution:** **Balance workload** or introduce **tiered support** (e.g., Level-1.5 for moderate issues).

##### **General Recommendations:**
- **Monitor Escalation Patterns:** Track how often escalations occur and their impact on resolution times.
- **Improve Agent Availability:** Ensure coverage during peak hours and overnight shifts.
- **Automate Alerts:** Use **AI-driven alerts** to flag tickets stuck in a stage for too long.
- **Optimize Workflow:** Reduce handoffs and ensure clear ownership at each stage.

### **Conclusion**
The main causes of delays are **escalation bottlenecks, overnight gaps, and resource constraints**. By implementing **strict SLAs, automated monitoring, and better workload management**, the support team can significantly reduce resolution times.
