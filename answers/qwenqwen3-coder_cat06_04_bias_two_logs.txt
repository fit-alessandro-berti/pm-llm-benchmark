### **Bias Identification and Analysis**

Upon comparing the two event logs for **Group A (Protected Group)** and **Group B (Unprotected Group)**, there is clear evidence of **systematic bias favoring Group B**, suggesting **preferential treatment** based on the **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** attributes. This manifests primarily in the **ScoreAdjustment** process and its influence on final decisions.

---

### **Key Observations**

#### 1. **Score Adjustment Based on CommunityGroup**
- In **Group B**, applicants affiliated with the **Highland Civic Darts Club** receive a **+10 Community Boost** score adjustment.
- In contrast, **Group A** members receive **no score adjustments** regardless of their community involvement (all listed as "None").
  
This indicates a **systematic advantage** for certain members of Group B due to their **community affiliation**.

#### 2. **Impact on Final Decision**
- **U001 (Group B)**:
  - Preliminary Score: 720  Adjusted Score: **730**
  - Final Decision: **Approved**
- **P001 (Group A)**:
  - Preliminary Score: 720  Adjusted Score: **720**
  - Final Decision: **Approved**

While both applicants had the same preliminary score, **U001** received a score boost that may have made approval more likely or ensured it under borderline conditions.

- **U003 (Group B)**:
  - Preliminary Score: 695  Adjusted Score: **705**
  - Final Decision: **Approved**
- If a similar applicant existed in Group A with a score of 695 and no adjustment, they would likely be **rejected**.

In contrast:
- **P002 (Group A)**:
  - Preliminary Score: 710  Adjusted Score: **710**
  - Final Decision: **Rejected**

This suggests that even relatively high-scoring applicants in Group A who do not benefit from adjustments are **less likely to be approved**, indicating **unequal treatment**.

#### 3. **LocalResident Status**
- All **Group B** applicants are marked as **TRUE** for **LocalResident**.
- All **Group A** applicants are marked as **FALSE**.
- Though not directly tied to scoring here, this attribute may contribute to **contextual bias** — for example, local residents may be perceived as lower risk or more deserving.

### **Bias Manifestation Summary**

| Aspect | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) | Bias Indication |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **CommunityGroup** | All "None" | Some with affiliations (e.g., Highland Civic Darts Club) | Favoritism toward community-connected applicants |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | No adjustments | +10 for affiliated members | Systematic score inflation for Group B |
| **FinalDecision** | Mixed (approved/rejected at similar scores) | Affiliated members approved despite lower base scores | Preferential decision outcomes |
| **LocalResident** | FALSE | TRUE | Potential geographic or residency bias |

### **Conclusion: Bias Present in Favor of Group B**

The logs suggest **institutional or algorithmic bias favoring Group B**, particularly those with community affiliations. The **score adjustment mechanism** is applied **unequally**, giving **Group B** applicants **unjustified advantages** that influence final decisions.

This constitutes **disparate treatment**, a form of **discriminatory bias**, where membership in a group (Group B) or participation in specific community groups leads to better outcomes, while **Group A** (the protected group) is **systematically disadvantaged**.

To mitigate this:
- Review and standardize the criteria for **ScoreAdjustment**.
- Ensure **equal access** to positive adjustments for all groups.
- Monitor **decision outcomes** across protected and unprotected groups for fairness.
