**Explanation:**

1.  **`SequencedEventsWithTiming` CTE:**
    *   This CTE processes the `event_log` table.
    *   It uses the `LAG` window function partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`.
    *   `LAG(activity, 1)` gets the activity name of the event that happened *immediately before* the current event within the same case.
    *   `LAG(timestamp, 1)` gets the timestamp of the event that happened *immediately before* the current event within the same case.
    *   `LAG(activity, 2)` gets the activity name of the event that happened *two steps before* the current event within the same case.
    *   This allows us to check for direct succession of activities.

2.  **`CasesWithProblematicSequence` CTE:**
    *   This CTE filters the results of `SequencedEventsWithTiming` to find the specific rows where the sequence finishes ('Confirm Order').
    *   The `WHERE` clause checks if the current event is 'Confirm Order', the previous was 'Create Order', and the one before that was 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. This ensures the direct succession.
    *   It also checks the timing condition: `(timestamp - prev_timestamp_1) > INTERVAL 5 DAY`. This calculates the difference between the current 'Confirm Order' timestamp and the previous 'Create Order' timestamp (from the detected sequence) and checks if it exceeds 5 days. DuckDB supports `INTERVAL` for datetime arithmetic.
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` collects the unique case identifiers that satisfy *both* the sequence and the timing criteria.

3.  **Final SELECT Statement:**
    *   This statement selects all columns (`*`) from the original `event_log` table.
    *   The `WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesWithProblematicSequence)` clause filters out all events belonging to any case ID that was identified in the `CasesWithProblematicSequence` CTE.
    *   The `ORDER BY` clause is optional but good practice for ordered result sets.

This query effectively isolates the problematic cases based on the complex criteria and then excludes all their events from the final output.
