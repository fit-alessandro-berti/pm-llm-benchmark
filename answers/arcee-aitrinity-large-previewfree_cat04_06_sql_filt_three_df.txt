First, it's important to identify cases that contain the exact sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order', with no intervening events from the same case. To do this, each event can be numbered within its case by timestamp, so that consecutive events can be identified by comparing row numbers.

Once each event is numbered within its case, it's possible to look for triples of consecutive events (row numbers differing by 1) where the activities match the specified sequence. For each such triple, the timestamps for 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' can be compared to calculate the elapsed time between them. If this time exceeds 5 days, the case is flagged for exclusion.

After identifying all such cases, the final step is to return all events from cases that are not flagged. This can be done by left joining the events table with the set of cases to exclude, and filtering out any events from excluded cases.

The SQL to accomplish this in DuckDB is as follows:

```sql
WITH
numbered_events AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
  FROM event_log
),
triples AS (
  SELECT
    ne1.case_id,
    ne1.timestamp AS approve_ts,
    ne2.timestamp AS create_ts,
    ne3.timestamp AS confirm_ts
  FROM numbered_events ne1
  JOIN numbered_events ne2
    ON ne1.case_id = ne2.case_id
    AND ne2.rn = ne1.rn + 1
  JOIN numbered_events ne3
    ON ne1.case_id = ne3.case_id
    AND ne3.rn = ne1.rn + 2
  WHERE ne1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND ne2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND ne3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
exclude_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM triples
  WHERE DATE_DIFF('day', create_ts, confirm_ts) > 5
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
LEFT JOIN exclude_cases ec
  ON e.case_id = ec.case_id
WHERE ec.case_id IS NULL;
```

This query numbers events within each case, finds the specified triples, flags cases where the relevant time gap exceeds 5 days, and returns all events from cases that do not meet these exclusion criteria.
