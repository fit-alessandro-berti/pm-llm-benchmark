Here are the main anomalies in terms of data and process:

**Anomalies in Frequency:**

* The frequency of "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> ... -> Payment < Payment" is 14 and has a performance of 26117485.714, which is inconsistent with other frequencies.
* The frequency of "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> ... -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> ... -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender" is 15 and has a performance of 25251840.000, which is lower than the expected value based on similar processes.

**Anomalies in Performance:**

* The performance of "Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> ... -> Appeal to Judge" (frequency = 20) is 25539840.000, which is higher than other processes with similar frequencies.
* The performance of "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> ... -> Payment < Payment>" (frequency = 14) is 26117485.714, which is higher than the average performance for similar frequencies.

**Anomalies in Process Structure:**

* Many processes have gaps or missing steps, such as "Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Add penalty" without a subsequent step.
* Some processes have repeated steps or redundant actions, such as "Payment < Payment".

Overall, these anomalies suggest that there may be inefficiencies or inconsistencies in the data and process flows.
