4. **Log Invoice in Accounting System**  **Confirm Goods/Services Receipt**
5. **Confirm Goods/Services Receipt**  **Match Invoice to PO**
6. **Match Invoice to PO** (no discrepancies)  **Department Manager Approval**
7. **Match Invoice to PO** (with discrepancies)  **Resolve Discrepancies**
8. **Resolve Discrepancies** (resolved)  **Department Manager Approval**
9. **Resolve Discrepancies** (unresolved)  **Escalate Complex Issues**
10. **Escalate Complex Issues** (resolved)  **Department Manager Approval**
