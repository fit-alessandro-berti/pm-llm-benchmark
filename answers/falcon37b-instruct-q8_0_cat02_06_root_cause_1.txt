### Analysis of Event Log

To identify significantly longer total resolution times, we first need to calculate the duration for each case from the receipt to closure. Let's break down the time for each ticket:

**Case 101:**
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:00
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:15
- **Total Duration:** 2 hours and 15 minutes (135 minutes)

**Case 102:**
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15
- **Total Duration:** 25 hours and 10 minutes (1510 minutes)

**Case 103:**
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:10
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:30
- **Total Duration:** 1 hour and 20 minutes (80 minutes)

**Case 104:**
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30
- **Total Duration:** 25 hours and 10 minutes (1510 minutes)

**Case 105:**
- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25
- Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30
- **Total Duration:** 46 hours and 5 minutes (2795 minutes)

### Identifying Long Cases

The cases with significantly longer resolution times compared to others are:

- Case 102: 1510 minutes (25 hours and 10 minutes)
- Case 104: 1510 minutes (25 hours and 10 minutes)
- Case 105: 2795 minutes (46 hours and 5 minutes)

### Potential Root Causes

**Escalation:**
- Cases 102 and 105 both involve escalation to a Level-2 Agent, which significantly extends the resolution time. Escalations typically indicate that initial attempts by Level-1 agents were insufficient or took longer than expected.

**Long Waiting Times:**
- Case 105 particularly stands out with an unusually long wait time between activities. For instance, from Assign to Level-1 Agent (2024-03-01 09:00) to Escalate to Level-2 Agent (2024-03-01 10:00), there is a 1-hour wait. This suggests potential delays in identifying when an escalation is necessary or in the processing of escalations.

**Investigation and Resolution Delays:**
- While all cases show some investigation and resolution times, Case 105's long duration indicates possible inefficiencies in these stages, possibly due to complex issues, limited resources, or other unresolved factors contributing to the delay.

### Recommendations

1. **Streamline Escalation Processes:**
   - Review the criteria for escalating tickets to ensure it is applied consistently and only when necessary. Implementing a more structured escalation process could reduce unnecessary escalations.

2. **Optimize Resource Allocation:**
   - Ensure there are sufficient Level-2 agents available during peak times to handle escalated cases promptly. Consider cross-training Level-1 agents for quicker resolution or providing additional resources to expedite processes.

3. **Enhance Communication and Coordination:**
   - Improve communication between Level-1 and Level-2 agents to ensure smooth handovers during escalations. Implementing real-time collaboration tools can help reduce waiting times.

4. **Conduct Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Investigate why some cases take longer to resolve, focusing on specific tickets like Case 105. This could reveal recurring issues with certain types of tickets or agents' performance areas needing improvement.

By addressing these areas, the customer support ticket resolution process can become more efficient, reducing overall cycle times and improving customer satisfaction.
