### Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance

#### **1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Constraints)**
**Case 2** violates two normative rules:  
- **Violation 1: Order reversal**  
  - **Activity:** Risk Assessment (2024-01-11 08:20) occurred before Credit Check (2024-01-11 09:00).  
  - **Reason:** The normative constraint requires Credit Check **must** precede Risk Assessment. This step was skipped/reversed, breaking the mandatory sequence.  
- **Violation 2: Contradictory action post-rejection**  
  - **Activity:** Finalize Documentation (2024-01-11 10:00) was performed after a Loan Decision (Rejected).  
  - **Reason:** For rejected loans, documentation must **not** be finalized before closing. Finalizing documentation post-rejection is explicitly prohibited.  

**Case 1 and Case 3** have **no normative violations**. They strictly adhere to the sequence and conditional actions (e.g., Case 3 finalized documentation only after approval).

#### **2. Failures to Meet Desiderata (Recommended Practices)**  
**Case 3** violates two desiderata:  
- **Violation 1: Delayed Credit Check**  
  - **Activity:** Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00) was performed 49 hours after Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00).  
  - **Reason:** The desideratum recommends completing Credit Check within 24 hours. This delay exceeds the recommended window.  
- **Violation 2: Delayed Applicant Notification**  
  - **Activity:** Inform Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00) occurred 51 hours after Loan Decision (Approved, 2024-01-14 12:00).  
  - **Reason:** The desideratum recommends notifying the applicant within 48 hours of the decision. This delay exceeds the recommended window.  
- **Additional Note:** Case 3 omits a Follow-up Call, but this is a soft recommendation (non-critical).  

**Cases 1 and 2** fully meet the desiderata:  
- **Case 1:** Credit Check (30 mins post-application) and Inform Applicant (2 hours post-decision) are timely.  
- **Case 2:** Credit Check (20 mins post-application) and Inform Applicant (30 mins post-decision) are timely (despite normative violations).

#### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**  
**Case 2 (Normative Violations):**  
- **Order Reversal (Risk Assessment before Credit Check):**  
  - **Possible Justification:** A misunderstanding of the process or operational urgency (e.g., an urgent risk assessment was initiated prematurely). However, this violates the mandatory sequence and requires process retraining.  
- **Finalize Documentation post-Rejection:**  
  - **Possible Justification:** An automated system error or human oversight where documentation was finalized regardless of the decision. This should be addressed by implementing conditional logic in the system.  

**Case 3 (Desiderata Violations):**  
- **Delayed Credit Check (49 hours):**  
  - **Possible Justification:** High application volume, understaffing, or external dependencies (e.g., third-party credit agency delays). While non-critical, this indicates inefficiency.  
- **Delayed Applicant Notification (51 hours):**  
  - **Possible Justification:** Manual email/letter delays, human workload, or approval routing bottlenecks. This suggests a need for automation or workflow prioritization.  
- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  - **Possible Justification:** Resource constraints or customer opt-out. Since this is optional, it is not a critical failure but represents a missed opportunity for engagement.

### Summary Table  
| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? | Key Issues |  
|------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|  
| **1** | None | None | Fully compliant with both rules and recommendations. |  
| **2** | **Yes** (Order reversal; Finalize post-rejection) | None | Critical process errors requiring immediate correction. |  
| **3** | None | **Yes** (Delayed Credit Check; Delayed Notification) | Suboptimal efficiency; non-critical but needs improvement. |  

**Recommendation:**  
- **Case 2:** Audit process adherence and automate conditional logic to prevent finalizing documentation post-rejection.  
- **Case 3:** Investigate root causes of delays (e.g., staffing, tools) to improve timeliness.  
- **All Cases:** Monitor desiderata compliance to enhance service quality without enforcing strict penalties.
