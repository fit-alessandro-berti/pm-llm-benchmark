Based on the provided log and the required behavior, here is the final process tree structure that captures the discovered process:

`+ ( 'Receive Application (RA)', '->', (+ ( 'Validate Form (VF)', * ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' ) ) ), '->', 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', '->', 'Approval Decision (AD)', '->', (+ ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 'Archive Case (AC)' ) ) )`

### Explanation of the Structure:

1. **Receive Application (RA)**: This is the starting activity, indicating the receipt of an application.
2. **Validate Form (VF)**: This step occurs after receiving the application. It is repeated in true concurrency until all re-validations are completed.
3. **Request Missing Info (RMI)**: This step is optionally repeated (a loop) whenever more information is needed during the process. It alternates with **Validate Form (VF)** as part of an exclusive choice.
4. **Assess Eligibility (AE)**: After either completing the repetition loop or executing **Validate Form (VF)**, this step assesses the eligibility.
5. **Approval Decision (AD)**: This is the decision point following eligibility assessment.
6. **Send Confirmation (SC)**: After approval, a confirmation is sent (this step is often performed).
7. **Archive Case (AC)**: Finally, the case is archived, marking the end of the process.

This structure balances fitness (capturing the observed behavior), precision (explicitly modeling the optional repetitions), and simplicity (an understandable model).
