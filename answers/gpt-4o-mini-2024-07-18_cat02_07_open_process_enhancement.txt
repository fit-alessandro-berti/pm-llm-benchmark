**Process Enhancement** in process mining refers to the practice of improving existing business processes by leveraging insights gained from process data. It involves analyzing the performance of current processes and identifying opportunities for optimization, such as reducing bottlenecks, increasing efficiency, improving compliance, or enhancing customer satisfaction. The goal of process enhancement is to make informed decisions based on actual operational data.

Here's how process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking:

1. **Process Discovery**:
   - Process discovery is focused on creating a visual representation or model of a business process from event logs without any prior knowledge of the process.
   - The aim is to reveal the actual process as executed, capturing various paths and variations that occur in practice. Techniques such as process modeling algorithms are employed to create models like Petri nets or process maps.
   - It provides a foundational understanding of how processes work, which is essential for subsequent analysis steps.

2. **Conformance Checking**:
   - Conformance checking evaluates how closely the observed behavior (extracted from event logs) aligns with a predefined process model (which can be based on industry standards or organizational policies).
   - It helps identify deviations, compliance issues, and conformance violations. The main interest is in understanding discrepancies between the expected operations (what should happen according to a model) and the actual operations (what happens in reality).
   - This step is crucial for ensuring that processes adhere to regulatory requirements and internal standards.

3. **Process Enhancement**:
   - After understanding the current state of processes through discovery and checking conformance, process enhancement aims to use insights from these analyses to suggest actionable improvements.
   - Techniques for enhancing processes might include re-engineering workflows, automating repetitive tasks, reallocating resources, or implementing best practices identified through the analysis.
   - It is more action-oriented, focusing on value generation and performance improvement.

In summary, while process discovery is about mapping out what processes actually look like, and conformance checking assesses how closely they adhere to expected models, process enhancement takes those insights to strategically improve and optimize the processes for better performance. All three concepts are integral to a comprehensive approach to process mining, each serving a different purpose in understanding and refining business operations.
