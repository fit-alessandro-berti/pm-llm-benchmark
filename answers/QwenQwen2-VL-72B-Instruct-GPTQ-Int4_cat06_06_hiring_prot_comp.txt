It is difficult to identify the main differences between the two groups without more information. The process variants and execution times are provided, but without additional context or data, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the differences between the groups.
In order to identify the main differences between the groups, it would be necessary to have more information about the context in which the process variants were observed, as well as any relevant background information about the groups being compared. Without this information, it is not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions about the differences between the groups based on the process variants and execution times provided.
