#### Anomalous Constraints

Here are the major anomalies in the DECLARE model:

1. **Conflicting end-points**:  
   - `precedence` (Close after Receive) and `existence` C (existence of Close)
   - The `precedence: C (R)` rule states that every claim must be closed (`C`) after being received (`R`). However, the `existence: C` rule states that a closing event (`C`) always must exist. This causes a conflict because closing depends on multiple events, not just receiving.

2. **Missing precedence dependency between R and A**:  
   - `exist:R` (existence of Receive) and `responded_existence: E (A)`
   - There is no precedence rule that enforces Assign (`A`) must occur after Receive (`R`). There's no precedence rule `A` after `R`. The `responded_existence: E (A)` rule suggests that E must exist after A, implicitly implying A should follow R for logic consistency, but R and A have no explicit precedence relation.    

3. **Implicit dependency conflict**:  
   - `noncoexistence: E (C)`
   - The `noncoexistence: E (C)` rule logically conflicts with the `precedence: C (R)` rule, because a Close (`C`) can only be set after an Evaluate (`E`) and C and E can't co-exist. This implies Evaluate (`E`) can't be followed by Close (`C`).

#### Hypotheses

Possible reasons these anomalies:

1. Incorrect modeling of actual business processes by the modelers or stakeholders leading to contradictory precedence and coexistence logic.
2. Model may have been incrementally updated over time, resulting in inconsistencies where newer rules conflict with older ones.
3. Incomplete or inconsistent data used to formulate the constraints, potentially leading to anomalies.
4. Pressure to streamline the process may have introduced shortcuts that conflict with underlying business rules, prioritizing speed over process consistency.

#### Verification Approaches

SQL-based Verification Strategies:

1. **Evaluated claims without assignment**:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id, c.claim_amount, c.submission_date
FROM
    claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_eval 
    ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_assign 
    ON c.claim_id = ce_assign.claim_id AND ce_assign.activity = 'A'
WHERE 
    ce_assign.claim_id IS NULL
```
- Verifies instances where evaluation (`E`) occurred sans assign (`A`), conflicting with `responded_existence: E (A)` logic.

2. **Claims closed immediately after receipt**:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce.activity, ce."timestamp"
FROM 
    claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_close 
    ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
JOIN claim_events ce_receive 
    ON c.claim_id = ce_receive.claim_id AND ce_receive.activity = 'R'
WHERE 
    ce_close."timestamp" IS NOT DISTINCT FROM ce_receive."timestamp"  -- Using IS NOT DISTINCT to handle nulls in timestamps
```
- Finds traces where closure (`C`) and receipt (`R`) occur without intermediary activities, conflicting with implied process flow and `precedence: C (R)`.

3. **Claims evaluated concurrently with closure**:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.submission_date
FROM 
    claims c
JOIN claim_events ce_eval 
    ON c.claim_id = ce_eval.claim_id AND ce_eval.activity = 'E'
JOIN claim_events ce_close 
    ON c.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id AND ce_close.activity = 'C'
WHERE 
    ce_eval.claim_id = ce_close.claim_id
```
- Identifies if claims were evaluated (`E`) simultaneously with closure (`C`), which contradicts `noncoexistence: E (C)`.

These SQL queries help validate the real-world frequency of these anomalies to assess the severity of the issues and take appropriate steps to correct the DECLARE model.
