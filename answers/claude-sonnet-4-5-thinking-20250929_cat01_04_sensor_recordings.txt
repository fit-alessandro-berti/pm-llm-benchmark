# Process Mining Analysis: Manufacturing Assembly Line Event Log

## Activity Identification and Labeling

After analyzing the sensor reading patterns, I've identified **6 distinct manufacturing activities** in this event log. Here's my detailed analysis:

---

### **Activity 1: Idle/Standby**
**Events: 1-3, 13-15**

**Sensor Pattern:**
- Temperature: ~20-21°C (ambient)
- Pressure: 1 bar (baseline)
- Vibration: 0 Hz (no movement)
- Material Flow: 0 units/s
- Tool Position: 0 mm (home position)
- Energy: 0.40-0.50 kWh (minimal)

**Rationale:** All readings are at baseline levels with no activity. The machine is powered on but not performing operations. Tool is at home position (0 mm). This represents waiting periods between production cycles.

### **Activity 2: Cutting Metal**
**Events: 4-6**

**Sensor Pattern:**
- Temperature: 50-58°C (rising, moderate-high)
- Pressure: 1-1.5 bar (slight increase)
- Vibration: 30-38 Hz (high and increasing)
- Material Flow: 5 units/s (steady, highest rate)
- Tool Position: 5-10 mm (advancing progressively)
- Energy: 2.00-3.00 kWh (increasing significantly)

**Rationale:** The combination of high vibration, advancing tool position, consistent material flow, and rising temperature/energy indicates active material removal. The progressive tool advancement with steady material flow is characteristic of a cutting operation where the tool moves through material, generating heat from friction and consuming significant energy.

### **Activity 3: Assembling Parts**
**Events: 7-8**

**Sensor Pattern:**
- Temperature: 40°C (moderate, decreased from cutting)
- Pressure: 2 bar (highest pressure, increased)
- Vibration: 10 Hz (low)
- Material Flow: 2 units/s (reduced)
- Tool Position: 15 mm (stable)
- Energy: 2.00 kWh (moderate, stable)

**Rationale:** Pressure increases while vibration decreases dramatically—suggesting controlled force application rather than cutting. The stable tool position with increased pressure indicates parts being pressed or fitted together. Lower material flow and reduced vibration suggest precise, controlled movements typical of assembly operations.

### **Activity 4: Welding**
**Event: 9**

**Sensor Pattern:**
- Temperature: 80°C (very high spike)
- Pressure: 2 bar (maintained)
- Vibration: 50 Hz (very high spike)
- Material Flow: 0 units/s (none)
- Tool Position: 15 mm (maintained)
- Energy: 5.00 kWh (maximum spike)

**Rationale:** This brief event shows extreme spikes in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption—classic indicators of welding. No material flow (parts are already positioned) and stable tool position suggest the tool is stationary while applying intense localized heat to join components. The highest energy reading in the entire log confirms a high-intensity thermal process.

### **Activity 5: Cooling/Post-Welding**
**Event: 10**

**Sensor Pattern:**
- Temperature: 30°C (rapidly cooling)
- Pressure: 1 bar (returned to baseline)
- Vibration: 1 Hz (minimal)
- Material Flow: 0 units/s
- Tool Position: 15 mm (maintained)
- Energy: 1.00 kWh (reduced)

**Rationale:** All metrics show a rapid decrease from the welding peak but haven't returned to idle state yet. Temperature is still elevated but cooling. This represents a transitional phase where the workpiece/tool must cool before the next operation can safely begin.

### **Activity 6: Quality Inspection**
**Events: 11-12**

**Sensor Pattern:**
- Temperature: 25°C (near ambient)
- Pressure: 1 bar (baseline)
- Vibration: 5 Hz (very low)
- Material Flow: 1 unit/s (minimal)
- Tool Position: 20 mm (slightly advanced, stable)
- Energy: 1.50-1.60 kWh (low-moderate, stable)

**Rationale:** Very low vibration with minimal but present material movement suggests careful, non-intrusive operation. The slight advancement in tool position with minimal energy use indicates scanning or measurement rather than material processing. The stable, low readings across two consecutive events suggest a deliberate inspection phase before completing the cycle.

## **Process Flow Summary**

The complete manufacturing cycle identified is:

```
[Idle/Standby]  [Cutting Metal]  [Assembling Parts]  [Welding]  
[Cooling]  [Quality Inspection]  [Idle/Standby]
```

**Duration:** 70 seconds (one complete cycle)

This represents a typical metal fabrication workflow where raw material is cut to size, assembled with other components, permanently joined through welding, cooled, inspected for quality, and then the machine resets for the next cycle.
