The events can be grouped into three distinct cases based on consistent patient demographics (age/gender), logical sequences of care activities, and department movements. Here's the grouping:

**Case 1**  
Events: 1, 4, 7, 15  
Patient: 45-year-old male (ER  Hearing triage  X-ray  Discharge)  
- Registration (ER)  Initial triage (ER)  X-ray imaging (Radiology)  Discharge (ER with follow-up)

**Case 2**  
Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17  
Patient: 62-year-old female (ER  Triage  Lab work  Minor infection care  Discharge)  
- Registration (ER)  Triage (ER)  Lab test request  Lab results  Doctor consultation  Prescription  Discharge (ER with pharmacy follow-up)

**Case 3**  
Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  
Patient: 28-year-old male (Surgery  Scheduled surgery  Post-op care  Discharge)  
- Registration (Surgery)  Pre-op consultation  Surgery prep  Arthroscopic surgery  Recovery  Discharge (Surgery with physiotherapy)

### Key Patterns Used:
1. **Patient Demographics**:  
   - Cases are uniquely identified by fixed patient ages/genders (e.g., Case 1: 45/M; Case 2: 62/F; Case 3: 28/M).  
   - All events for a case share the same demographics.

2. **Logical Sequences**:  
   - Sequences start with registration, followed by => initial triage{xray/labs}/pre-op{consultation/prep}, proceed through interventions (X-ray, surgery, lab tests), and end with discharge.  
   - Cross-department activities (e.g., ER to Radiology) maintain the same patient context.

3. **Resource Continuity**:  
   - Providers (e.g., Dr. Smith in Case 2, Dr. Lee in Case 3) progressively engage with the patient, reinforcing case membership.

### Edge Case Handling:
- Event 12 (ER consultation for 62/F) and Event 14 (ER prescription) align with Case 2’s timeline even though the consultation occurs after lab results. This follows typical workflows where imaging/labs often precede clinical decisions.

This grouping ensures no event overlaps between cases and maintains consistency with standard hospital workflows.
