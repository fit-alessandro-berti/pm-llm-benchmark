### **Process Mining Analysis of Manufacturing Event Log**

After analyzing the event log, I identified **five distinct phases** in the machine's operation, each corresponding to a likely manufacturing activity. Below is the grouping of events into activities, along with the rationale for each label.

---

### **1. Idle / Machine Startup (Events 1–3, 13–15)**
**Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
**Assigned Label:** *"Idle / Machine Startup"*

#### **Rationale:**
- **Temperature:** Low and stable (~20–21°C).
- **Pressure:** Minimal (1 bar).
- **Vibration:** Near zero (0–0 Hz).
- **Material Flow:** Zero (0 units/s).
- **Tool Position:** Fully retracted (0 mm).
- **Energy Consumption:** Low (~0.4–0.5 kWh).

**Interpretation:**
- The machine is either **idle** or in a **startup phase** with no active processing.
- No significant sensor activity suggests no material is being worked on.
- The slight variations in energy consumption (0.4–0.5 kWh) may indicate background systems running.

### **2. Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)**
**Events:** 4, 5, 6
**Assigned Label:** *"Cutting Metal"*

#### **Rationale:**
- **Temperature:** Moderate increase (50–58°C).
- **Pressure:** Slightly elevated (1–1.5 bar).
- **Vibration:** High (30–38 Hz).
- **Material Flow:** Steady (5 units/s).
- **Tool Position:** Moving (5–10 mm).
- **Energy Consumption:** Moderate to high (2.0–3.0 kWh).

**Interpretation:**
- **High vibration** is characteristic of **cutting operations** (e.g., sawing, milling, or laser cutting).
- **Moderate temperature increase** suggests friction from cutting.
- **Steady material flow** indicates continuous feeding of raw material.
- **Tool movement** confirms active engagement with the workpiece.
- **Energy consumption** is elevated due to the power required for cutting.

### **3. Cooling / Transition (Events 7–8)**
**Events:** 7, 8
**Assigned Label:** *"Cooling / Transition"*

#### **Rationale:**
- **Temperature:** Drops from cutting levels (58°C  40°C).
- **Pressure:** Slightly higher (2 bar).
- **Vibration:** Reduced (10 Hz).
- **Material Flow:** Lower (2 units/s).
- **Tool Position:** Stationary (15 mm).
- **Energy Consumption:** Moderate (2.0 kWh).

**Interpretation:**
- The machine is **cooling down** after cutting.
- **Reduced vibration** suggests the cutting tool is disengaged.
- **Lower material flow** may indicate a pause in feeding.
- **Stationary tool position** suggests a **transition phase** before the next operation.
- **Energy consumption remains moderate**, possibly due to cooling systems or idle power draw.

### **4. Welding (Event 9)**
**Events:** 9
**Assigned Label:** *"Welding"*

#### **Rationale:**
- **Temperature:** **Peak (80°C)**—much higher than other phases.
- **Pressure:** Moderate (2 bar).
- **Vibration:** Very high (50 Hz).
- **Material Flow:** Zero (0 units/s).
- **Tool Position:** Stationary (15 mm).
- **Energy Consumption:** **Very high (5.0 kWh)**.

**Interpretation:**
- **Extreme temperature spike** is characteristic of **welding** (arc, laser, or resistance welding).
- **High vibration** suggests intense mechanical or thermal stress.
- **No material flow** indicates the workpiece is stationary during welding.
- **High energy consumption** is expected due to the power required for welding.
- **Stationary tool position** suggests a fixed welding head.

---

### **5. Quality Inspection / Adjustment (Events 10–12)**
**Events:** 10, 11, 12
**Assigned Label:** *"Quality Inspection / Adjustment"*

#### **Rationale:**
- **Temperature:** Drops significantly (80°C  25–30°C).
- **Pressure:** Returns to baseline (1 bar).
- **Vibration:** Low (1–5 Hz).
- **Material Flow:** Minimal (0–1 units/s).
- **Tool Position:** Adjusting (15  20 mm).
- **Energy Consumption:** Low to moderate (1.0–1.6 kWh).

**Interpretation:**
- **Rapid cooling** suggests the machine is no longer performing high-energy operations.
- **Low vibration** indicates no heavy machining.
- **Minimal material flow** suggests the workpiece is being **inspected or repositioned**.
- **Tool position adjustment** (15  20 mm) may indicate **fine-tuning or measurement**.
- **Moderate energy use** could be from sensors, cameras, or robotic arms used in inspection.

### **Summary of Labeled Activities**

| **Activity**               | **Events** | **Key Sensor Patterns**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Idle / Machine Startup** | 1–3, 13–15 | Low temp, pressure, vibration, zero flow, retracted tool, low energy.                  |
| **Cutting Metal**          | 4–6        | Moderate temp, high vibration, steady flow, moving tool, moderate-high energy.         |
| **Cooling / Transition**   | 7–8        | Temp drop, reduced vibration, lower flow, stationary tool, moderate energy.            |
| **Welding**                | 9          | **Peak temp (80°C)**, very high vibration, zero flow, stationary tool, **high energy**. |
| **Quality Inspection**     | 10–12      | Cooling, low vibration, minimal flow, tool adjustment, low-moderate energy.            |

### **Process Flow Inference**
Based on the sequence of events, the **likely manufacturing process** is:
1. **Machine starts up (Idle).**
2. **Cuts metal (Cutting).**
3. **Cools down (Transition).**
4. **Performs welding (Welding).**
5. **Inspects/adjusts the workpiece (Quality Inspection).**
6. **Returns to idle.**

This resembles a **metal fabrication process** where raw material is cut, welded, and inspected before moving to the next stage.

### **Conclusion**
By analyzing **sensor patterns** (temperature, vibration, flow, tool position, and energy), we successfully **reverse-engineered the manufacturing activities** from raw event logs. This approach is foundational in **process mining**, where unlabeled data is transformed into meaningful process models.
