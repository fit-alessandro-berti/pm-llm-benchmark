**Explanation:**

1. **Import pandas:**  We use pandas for efficient data manipulation and merging.
2. **`merge_event_logs(log_a, log_b)` function:**
   - Takes the two log strings as input.
   - **Convert to DataFrames:**  Reads the log strings into pandas DataFrames.
   - **Timestamp Conversion:** Converts the 'timestamp' columns to datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime()`.
   - **Timestamp Tolerance:** Defines a `timestamp_tolerance` of 2 seconds. This is crucial for handling slight timestamp differences.
   - **Merge DataFrames:**  Merges the DataFrames using `pd.merge()` based on the `order_id` column.  `how='outer'` ensures that all events from both logs are included in the result, even if there's no matching event in the other log.
   - **Rename Event Names:**  Replaces event names in `log_b` with standardized names to ensure consistency.
   - **Sort by Timestamp:** Sorts the merged log chronologically based on the 'timestamp' column.
   - **Return Merged Log:** Returns the merged DataFrame.

**Output:**

The code will print a pandas DataFrame containing the merged event log. The DataFrame will include all events from both logs, with merged attributes and a chronological order.  Events that appear only in one log will be preserved, along with their origin (log name).  The timestamps will be aligned as closely as possible, considering the defined tolerance.
