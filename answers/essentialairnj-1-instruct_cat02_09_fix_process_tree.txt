**Analysis of the Current Model:**

1. Activities like creating a purchase order, receiving goods, receiving invoice, matching invoice to PO, and paying invoice should not occur in parallel as they are dependent on each other in sequence.
2. Closing the case should occur only after all the necessary tasks are completed, i.e., creating and approving the requisition, followed by creating the purchase order, receiving goods, receiving the invoice, matching the invoice to the PO, and paying the invoice.
3. The current model allows unwanted behavior such as paying the invoice before receiving goods or receiving the invoice.

**Corrected Process Tree Model:**

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Corrected structure:
# A sequence that starts with creating and approving the requisition.
# It then creates the purchase order.
# This is mixed with a sequence where goods are received, invoice is received, matched, and paid in that exact order.
# Finally, the case is closed.

goods_invoice_pay_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice
])

root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[create_req, approve_req, create_po, goods_invoice_pay_sequence, close_case])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Activities that need to be in a strict sequence:**
   - The process of receiving, matching, and paying an invoice should occur in sequence, as it depends on each other and must follow a specific order.
   - Also, the activities of creating a purchase order and receiving goods must occur in the given order to ensure that the PO is issued before payment is made.

2. **Updated Model:**
   - The corrected model uses a `SEQUENCE` structure for creating and approving the requisition and creating the purchase order, followed by a `SEQUENCE` of the duties related to receiving, invoicing, matching, and paying the invoice.

3. **Preventing Unwanted Behavior:**
   - The updated process tree ensures that the goods are received before an invoice is paid, preventing situations where the invoice might be paid in advance of receipt, which is not logical or appropriate.
   - Also, it mandates that all steps, including receiving goods, receiving the invoice, matching the invoice to the PO, and paying the invoice, should happen in the specified sequence, thus preventing any out-of-order actions.
