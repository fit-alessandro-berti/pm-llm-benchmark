Below is a stepbystep walkthrough of the pseudoBPMN diagram you supplied, together with the business intent of each element, the role of the gateways, and the way the “standard” and “custom” request paths diverge and later converge. I have also highlighted the conditions that cause an approval step or a rework loop.

## 1. Highlevel overview  

The diagram models the **orderfulfilment frontoffice workflow** that starts when a customer submits a request and ends when a confirmation is sent.  

* **Start Event** – the moment the request is received in the system.  
* **End Event** – the final communication to the customer confirming that the request has been processed.  

All activities in between are **tasks** (work that must be performed by a person or an automated system) and **gateways** (decision points that control the flow).

## 2. Detailed walkthrough  

### 2.1. Receive Customer Request  

| Element | Business purpose |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Task A – “Receive Customer Request”** | Capture the inbound order (email, webform, phone call, etc.) and create a record in the ordermanagement system. This is the entry point for every subsequent processing. |

---

### 2.2. Determine request type  

| Element | Business purpose |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Gateway (XOR) – “Check Request Type”** | An exclusiveOR (XOR) gateway evaluates a single condition and routes the flow to **exactly one** of its outgoing branches. Here it checks whether the request belongs to the **Standard** product line or requires a **Custom** solution. |

*If the request is **Standard**  follow the “Standard” branch (TaskB1).  
If the request is **Custom**  follow the “Custom” branch (TaskB2).*

---

### 2.3. Standardrequest path  

| Element | Business purpose |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”** | Run the routine checks that apply to every standard order (e.g., verify required fields, basic eligibility, pricing rules). |
| **Gateway (AND) – “Run Parallel Checks”** | An **ANDgateway** (also called a parallel gateway) splits the flow into **multiple concurrent** branches that must all be completed before the process can continue. It is used because the credit check and inventory check can be performed independently and in parallel, speeding up the overall processing time. |
| **Task C1 – “Credit Check”** | Query the creditrisk system to ensure the customer’s credit limit is sufficient. |
| **Task C2 – “Inventory Check”** | Verify that the requested items are in stock (or can be allocated). |
| **Join (AND) – “All Parallel Checks Completed”** | The parallel branches reconverge at a **joinAND** gateway. The flow proceeds only after **both** C1 and C2 have finished successfully. |
| **Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”** | Using the results of the credit and inventory checks, compute a realistic delivery schedule (e.g., based on stock availability, shipping constraints). |

*Result of the Standard branch:* a validated order with a calculated delivery date, ready for the next decision point (approval).  

---

### 2.4. Customrequest path  

| Element | Business purpose |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”** | Conduct a more in analysis (technical feasibility, cost estimate, resource capacity, etc.) because the request involves a nonstandard product or service. |
| **Gateway (XOR) – “Is Customization Feasible?”** | An exclusive decision: if the feasibility study says *yes*, the process moves forward to quotation; if *no*, the request is rejected. |
| **Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation”** | Build a detailed quote that includes engineering effort, special tooling, leadtime, etc. |
| **Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice”** | Notify the customer that the requested customization cannot be delivered, and terminate the process (End Event). |

*Result of the Custom branch (when feasible):* a custom quotation is ready, after which the flow proceeds to the same “approval?” decision that the Standard branch uses.

---

### 2.5. Common postvalidation decision – “Is Approval Needed?”  

| Element | Business purpose |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Gateway (XOR) – “Is Approval Needed?”** | This exclusive decision asks whether the order (standard or custom) must be reviewed by a manager. Typical triggers: highvalue orders, special discounts, or any custom quotation that exceeds a predefined threshold. |
| **If Yes  Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”** | The order is sent to a manager for signoff. |
| **If No  Skip to Task G – “Generate Final Invoice.”** | For lowrisk or lowvalue orders, the system can automatically generate the invoice without human signoff. |

---

### 2.6. Managerapproval subprocess  

| Element | Business purpose |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Gateway (XOR) – “Is Approval Granted?”** | After the manager reviews the request, there are two possible outcomes. |
| **If Yes  Task G – “Generate Final Invoice.”** | The manager approves, and the system proceeds to create the final invoice (same task used in the “noapproval” branch). |
| **If No  Task H – “Reevaluate Conditions.”** | The manager declines, prompting a rework loop. The reevaluation may involve: |
| • **Standard path:** revisiting the deliverydate calculation (TaskD) – perhaps a different shipping method or a discount can be applied. |
| • **Custom path:** revisiting the quotation (TaskE1) – maybe adjusting scope, price, or offering alternatives. |
| **Loop back:** The diagram shows a **backarrow** from TaskH to either TaskE1 (for custom) or TaskD (for standard). This creates a **rework cycle** that repeats until the manager finally approves or the request is abandoned. |

---

### 2.7. Finalization and customer notification  

| Element | Business purpose |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Task G – “Generate Final Invoice.”** | Produce a legally binding invoice that reflects the agreed price, taxes, delivery terms, etc. |
| **Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer.”** | Email (or otherwise communicate) the invoice, delivery date, and any additional instructions to the customer. |
| **End Event** | Marks the completion of the orderprocessing workflow. |

## 3. How the two request types differ  

| Aspect | Standard Request | Custom Request |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Initial validation** | Simple, rulebased checks (TaskB1). | Detailed feasibility study (TaskB2). |
| **Parallel activities** | Credit and inventory checks run in parallel (C1, C2). | No parallel checks; only the feasibility analysis. |
| **Result of the branch** | Delivery date is calculated (TaskD). | A custom quotation is prepared (TaskE1). |
| **Potential rejection** | Not explicit in the diagram – standard requests are assumed to be always feasible after validation. | Explicit rejection path (TaskE2) when feasibility fails. |
| **Rework loop** | If approval is denied, the loop returns to the deliverydate calculation (TaskD). | If approval is denied, the loop returns to the quotation preparation (TaskE1). |

All downstream steps (approval decision, invoice generation, customer confirmation) are **common** to both paths, which is why the diagram converges after the “Is Approval Needed?” gateway.

---

## 4. Conditions that trigger approvals or rework  

| Trigger | What happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **Order value / risk exceeds a threshold**  “Is Approval Needed?” = **Yes**  Manager approval (TaskF). |
| **Lowvalue or routine order**  “Is Approval Needed?” = **No**  Directly generate invoice (TaskG). |
| **Manager approves**  “Is Approval Granted?” = **Yes**  Invoice generated (TaskG). |
| **Manager rejects**  “Is Approval Granted?” = **No**  Reevaluate conditions (TaskH)  Loop back to the relevant earlier task (D for standard, E1 for custom). |
| **Custom feasibility fails**  “Is Customization Feasible?” = **No**  Send rejection notice (TaskE2) and terminate the process. |

The **reevaluation** step is deliberately placed before the invoice generation, ensuring that any changes (price adjustments, deliverydate revisions, scope modifications) are captured and the manager can reapprove the updated request.

---

## 5. Convergence and looping summary  

1. **Divergence** – The XOR gateway after “Check Request Type” creates two mutually exclusive branches (Standard vs. Custom).  
2. **Parallelism** – Inside the Standard branch, an AND gateway splits into two concurrent checks (credit & inventory) that later rejoin.  
3. **Reconvergence** – Both branches eventually arrive at the “Is Approval Needed?” XOR gateway, meaning that after their specific processing they share the same approval logic.  
4. **Looping** – The “Reevaluate Conditions” task (H) feeds back to the most recent branchspecific task (D or E1). This loop continues until the manager grants approval, at which point the flow proceeds forward to invoice generation and final confirmation.  

---

## 6. Businessprocess rationale  

* **Efficiency:** Parallel credit and inventory checks reduce lead time for standard orders.  
* **Risk control:** The “Is Approval Needed?” decision enforces managerial oversight only when necessary, avoiding bottlenecks for routine orders.  
* **Flexibility:** Custom requests are handled with a dedicated feasibility analysis and a separate rework loop, allowing the organization to adapt quotes and delivery plans without restarting the whole process.  
* **Transparency:** Each decision point (gateways) is clearly labeled, making it easy for auditors or process owners to understand why a request follows a particular path.

### TL;DR (quick cheatsheet)

| Step | What happens | When it occurs |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **A** | Capture request | Immediately after customer submits |
| **XOR – Type** | Route to Standard (B1) or Custom (B2) | Based on product/service classification |
| **B1** | Simple validation | Standard only |
| **AND – Parallel** | Credit (C1) & Inventory (C2) checks run together | Standard only |
| **Join** | Wait for both checks | Standard only |
| **D** | Compute delivery date | Standard only |
| **B2** | Feasibility study | Custom only |
| **XOR – Feasibility** | If feasible  E1 (quote); else  E2 (reject) | Custom only |
| **XOR – Approval Needed?** | If highrisk/value  Manager approval (F); else  skip | Both paths |
| **F** | Manager reviews | When approval needed |
| **XOR – Approval Granted?** | Yes  G (invoice); No  H (reevaluate) | After manager review |
| **H** | Adjust D (standard) or E1 (custom) | When manager rejects |
| **G** | Generate final invoice | After approval or when no approval needed |
| **I** | Send confirmation to customer | End of process |
| **End** | Process complete | After confirmation |

I hope this explanation clarifies the intent of each BPMN element, how the standard and custom flows differ, and the exact conditions that cause approvals or rework loops. Let me know if you’d like any part of the process expanded further!
