Got it! Let’s carefully construct the solution.  

We need to detect a very **specific sequence of events in direct succession** within the same case. The approach is:

1. Use **window functions** (`LEAD`) to peek ahead in the event sequence (ordered by timestamp) so we can identify when a case has:  
   `"Approve Purchase Requisition"`  `"Create Order"`  `"Confirm Order"` with no intervening events.  

2. When identifying `"Create Order"`, we also need to know the timestamp difference between `"Create Order"` and `"Confirm Order"`.

3. Mark all `case_id`s that contain the sequence where the gap is more than **5 days**.  

4. Finally, exclude all events from those cases.

### DuckDB SQL Query

```sql
WITH ordered AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next2_act,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_time,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next2_time
    FROM event_log
),
flagged_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_act = 'Create Order'
      AND next2_act = 'Confirm Order'
      AND DATE_DIFF('day', next_time, next2_time) > 5
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM flagged_cases)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

### Explanation

1. **`ordered` CTE**  
   - Keeps each event, plus the next and next-next activity (and timestamps) for the same case.  
   - This ensures we can check for the exact sequence over three consecutive events without gaps.

2. **`flagged_cases` CTE**  
   - Filters cases where the sequence `'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order'` occurs in direct succession.  
   - Additionally ensures that the time difference between `"Create Order"` and `"Confirm Order"` is **more than 5 days**.

3. **Final SELECT**  
   - Excludes any case that matches the sequence + timing condition.  
   - Returns all other events, sorted by case and timestamp.

---

 This query respects the requirements:  
- Ensures **direct succession** of the event sequence.  
- Uses a **time condition** for filtering (`> 5 days`).  
- Excludes the matching cases entirely from the output, returning only safe cases.  

Would you like me to also provide a **variant query** that keeps only the **case_ids** (instead of all event rows) for debugging purposes? This can help you check which cases are being filtered before running the full exclusion.
