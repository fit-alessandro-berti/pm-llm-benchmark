# Comprehensive Proposal: Data-Driven Resource Assignment Optimization Using Process Mining

To help TechSolve Solutions overcome operational inefficiencies and optimize their resource assignment practices, we propose a structured, comprehensive approach leveraging advanced process mining techniques.

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### **Metrics for Analyzing Individual Agents and Support Tiers:**

Using the provided event logs, we will focus on:

- **Workload distribution:**
  - Number of tickets assigned per agent/tier (daily, weekly, monthly).
  - Variance in workload volume among agents.

- **Activity processing times (APT):**
  - Time spent per incident per agent (via timestamps between "Start Work" and "Complete" events).
  - Comparing average processing times across agents and tiers.

- **First-call resolution (FCR) for L1:**
  - Percentage of tickets resolved at L1 without escalation.
  - Breakdown of FCR by incident category and required skill.

- **Frequency of escalations and reassignments:**
  - Count of escalation instances per agent.
  - Frequency of intra-tier and inter-tier reassignments by ticket attributes (priority, category, skill).

- **Skill utilization:**
  - Number of tickets handled per specific skill.
  - Frequency agents work on tickets within vs. outside their documented skillset.

---

### **Process Mining Techniques to Reveal Actual Patterns:**

- **Resource Interaction & Social Network Analysis (SNA):**
  Analyze agent interactions, focusing on handovers. Identify clusters of agents between which frequent reassignments or escalations occur. Detect informal, unintended routing patterns diverging from the intended structure.

- **Role Discovery & Comparative Analysis:**
  Apply role mining techniques to identify actual agent roles based on performed activities (assignments, escalations). Compare actual discovered roles with documented roles and intended tier allocation logic.

- **Process Map & Variant Analysis:**
  Visualize actual process paths versus intended escalation procedures. Highlight frequent deviations from the designed process, such as repetitive assignments or unnecessary escalations.

---

### **Analyzing Skill Utilization Effectiveness:**

- Cross-tabulate assigned tickets with agent skill profiles to quantify mismatches between skills and tasks.
- Measure how often L2/L3 specialists handle tickets below their expertise level, effectively underutilizing their specialized capabilities.
- Identify occurrences where agents without matching skillsets were assigned specific skill-demanded tasks, causing escalations or reassignments.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### **Specific resource-related problems pinpointed:**

- **Insufficient specialized skill availability:**
  Analyze queue waiting times for tickets requiring skilled resources (e.g., Networking-Firewall, Security-IAM), highlighting skills with consistently high wait durations.

- **Impact of reassignments & escalations:**
  Calculate average delays introduced per reassignment/escalation, quantifying overhead introduced due to incorrect initial assignments or insufficient skills.

- **Incorrect initial assignments:**
  Identify incidents frequently escalated from L1 due to insufficient skill mapping at dispatch time or weak preliminary categorization.

- **Underperformance or overload per resource:**
  Identify agents with consistently above-average backlog and SLA breaches, indicating overload. Conversely, detect agents with low case loadings, suggesting underutilization.

- **Correlation with SLA Breaches:**
  Establish statistical correlation between skill mismatches or frequent escalations/reassignments and SLA breaches—quantifying what proportion of breached SLAs occur due to resource assignment inefficiencies.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### **Potential Root Causes:**

- **Rigid or simplistic assignment logic:**
  Current round-robin assignment does not consider agent proficiency or workload state, often failing to match incidents appropriately with resources.

- **Incomplete/Inaccurate skill profiles:**
  Discrepancy between documented agent skills versus actual capabilities. Inaccurate skill profiling causes poor initial assignments and unnecessary escalations.

- **Weak categorization and skill identification in initial triage:**
  Initial classification at L1 lacks accuracy, causing frequent escalations or reallocation.

- **Lack of real-time workload visibility & balancing mechanisms:**
  Dispatchers have insufficient visibility into real-time resource availability and workloads, resulting in uneven resource utilization.

- **Inadequate L1 empowerment & training:**
  Excessive escalations from L1 due to limited training or empowerment to resolve medium-complexity incidents.

### **Variant & Decision Mining to Confirm Causes:**

- **Variant Analysis:**
  Segment cases into smooth assignment flows versus problematic variants (frequent escalations/reassignments). Identify discriminating attributes or conditions driving inefficiencies.

- **Decision Mining:**
  Analyze decisions at escalation points, revealing rules or attributes consistently leading to ineffective assignments. Examine contextual factors (e.g., agents’ availability, skill availability, incident type) triggering poor assignment decisions.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

We propose these concrete, data-driven assignment strategies derived from process mining insights:

### **Strategy 1: Implement Skill-Based Intelligent Routing**

**Issue Addressed:**
Poor skill matching and underutilization of specialist skills.

**How It Leverages Insights:**
Use historical event logs to map exact skills required per incident type and resolution outcomes. Agents will receive tickets matching precise skill profiles.

**Implementation Data Required:**
- Accurate agent skill profiles
- Historical ticket resolutions categorized by required skills
- Clearly labeled, skill-based historical incident data

**Expected Benefits:**
- Reduction of escalations and reassignments.
- Improved first-level resolution rates.
- Efficient use of specialist resources.

### **Strategy 2: Real-Time Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**

**Issue Addressed:**
Uneven workload distribution causing overload or idle time.

**How It Leverages Insights:**
Real-time algorithms integrate historical performance (average handle time, current queue depth, escalation likelihood) to assign tickets dynamically.

**Implementation Data Required:**
- Real-time visibility into agent workload (active cases, pending time, queue status)
- Average handle time data per agent and per ticket category
- Immediate escalation history per agent for similar cases

**Expected Benefits:**
- Balanced workloads, increased productivity.
- Reduced delays, fewer SLA breaches due to overload.
- Increased overall team efficiency.

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment—Complexity & Skill Prediction**

**Issue Addressed:**
High volume of avoidable escalations caused by inaccurate initial categorization and triage.

**How It Leverages Insights:**
Machine learning models predict required complexity and skills for incoming incidents based on historical ticket resolution data, description keywords, and attributes (e.g., priority, category, submission channel).

**Implementation Data Required:**
- Historical event logs well-annotated with resolution complexity levels and escalations.
- Incident description, priority data, and resolution paths.
- A trained predictive model (classification/modeling tool).

**Expected Benefits:**
- Increased accuracy for initial ticket assignment.
- Decreased escalations, better SLA compliance due to correct initial skill assignment.
- Promotes capacity planning and load balancing.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### **Using Simulation for Predictive Evaluation:**

Conduct **business process simulation** using mined historical resource behaviors, assignment rules, and hypothetical alternative assignment strategies. Simulate performance (e.g., SLA adherence, throughput times, number of escalations) under various what-if scenarios for validation before strategy deployment.

### **Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan:**

Establish a Process Mining Dashboard continuously tracking:

- **KPIs:**
  - SLA adherence per priority/skill.
  - Escalation and reassignment rates.
  - Agent skill utilization rates.
  - First-call resolution trends for L1.

- **Process views:**
  - Actual vs intended assignment flows.
  - Workload distribution heatmaps.
  - Time-to-resolve (segmenting by agent, tier, skill).

Regularly scheduled process mining evaluations (monthly/quarterly) would audit ongoing process performance, enabling continuous improvement and quick identification of emerging inefficiencies.

## **Conclusion & Next Steps:**

By employing these structured, data-driven strategies—fully informed by advanced process mining analysis—TechSolve Solutions can significantly improve resource allocation, reduce inefficiencies, and increase SLA compliance. Initial analysis followed by simulation allows validation of proposed changes before live deployment, ensuring effective implementation and sustainable optimization.
