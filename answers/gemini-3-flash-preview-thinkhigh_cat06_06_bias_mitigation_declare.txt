To mitigate potential bias in the loan application process, I have introduced several DECLARE constraints. These constraints ensure that sensitive information (like Race or Gender) cannot be the sole or immediate driver of a decision, and that any process involving sensitive attributes must undergo additional scrutiny via manual reviews and bias mitigation checks.

### Updated DECLARE Model

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        # If a sensitive attribute is checked, a ManualReview must occur at some point.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # If sensitive attributes are accessed, a BiasMitigationCheck must follow.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # A FinalDecision cannot be made unless a BiasMitigationCheck has occurred.
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altreponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chaincall": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        # Prevent a sensitive attribute check from being followed eventually by an 
        # immediate Reject without other intervening process steps.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {
        # Specifically prevent the very next step after checking race/gender from being a decision.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    }
}
```

### Rationale for Bias Mitigation Constraints

1.  **Manual Oversight via `responded_existence`**: By linking `CheckApplicantRace` and `CheckApplicantGender` to `ManualReview`, we ensure that any trace involving the collection of sensitive data triggers a human-in-the-loop requirement. This prevents fully automated, potentially biased algorithms from making decisions without oversight.
2.  **Mandatory Mitigation via `response`**: The `response` constraints between sensitive attribute checks and `BiasMitigationCheck` mandate that once sensitive data is entered into the system, a specific procedural step designed to evaluate fairness must be executed before the process completes.
3.  **Sequential Integrity via `precedence`**: By setting `BiasMitigationCheck` as a precedence for `FinalDecision`, we ensure that it is impossible to reach a conclusion on a loan application without first passing through the fairness verification step.
4.  **Preventing Direct Influence via `nonchainsuccession`**: These constraints are critical for preventing "snap judgments." By forbidding `Reject` or `Approve` from immediately following a sensitive attribute check, we force the process to include intermediate steps (like financial verification or risk assessment), ensuring that the decision is based on merit rather than demographic data.
5.  **Long-term Separation via `nonsuccession`**: This prevents the process from having a direct path from a sensitive attribute check to a rejection. It ensures that the "reasoning" for a rejection must be derived from non-sensitive activities that occur later in the trace.
