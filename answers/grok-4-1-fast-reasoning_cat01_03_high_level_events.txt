### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

The event log for cases A1 and B2 follows a highly consistent sequence, indicating a standardized manufacturing workflow for processing metal sheets (likely into a simple welded frame or panel). I identified **5 high-level steps** by grouping low-level events based on the following criteria:
- **Temporal proximity**: Events occurring in rapid succession (e.g., within seconds) without significant gaps (>30 seconds).
- **Logical coherence**: Events that form a self-contained sub-process (e.g., preparation actions leading to readiness for the next phase).
- **Resource patterns**: Shared resources or resource types (e.g., Operator A for initial handling, Operator B for welding).
- **Domain semantics**: Activities that align with typical manufacturing phases (preparation  core fabrication  inspection  finishing  validation).
- **Sequential dependency**: Events where one logically enables the next (e.g., preheating before welding).

Gaps in timestamps (e.g., ~40 seconds between preheating and welding pickup) were treated as phase boundaries, likely representing setup transitions.

Below is the structured mapping. Each high-level step includes:
- **Name**: Concise, domain-relevant label.
- **Low-Level Events Grouped**: Referenced by sequence position (common across cases A1/B2).
- **Example Timestamps** (from A1; B2 is analogous).
- **Rationale**: Justification for grouping.

| High-Level Step | Name                  | Low-Level Events Grouped                                                                 | Example Timestamps (A1)      | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| 1              | Material Preparation | - Retrieve raw metal sheet<br>- Scan barcode<br>- Place metal sheet on table<br>- Align metal sheet<br>- Preheat metal sheet | 08:00:05 to 08:00:20        | These initial events handle raw material intake, verification (barcode scan), positioning, and thermal conditioning. Performed sequentially by Operator A (manual handling) transitioning to machines (robot alignment, heater). Forms a distinct "setup" phase preparing the sheet for fabrication; temporally clustered (~15s duration) and prerequisite for welding. |
| 2              | Welding Assembly     | - Pick up welding tool<br>- Weld corner A<br>- Weld corner B                                             | 08:01:00 to 08:01:10        | Core fabrication step focused on joining/assembly using a single tool (W-12) by Operator B. Events are tightly coupled (tool pickup enables welds) and represent the primary value-adding transformation of the sheet into a welded structure. Short duration (~10s); logical unit before any post-weld activities. |
| 3              | Weld Integrity Check | - Measure weld integrity                                                                         | 08:01:20                    | Immediate, automated quality verification specific to the prior welding output (integrity score). Performed by dedicated sensor; stands alone as a quick checkpoint (~10s after welding) to detect defects early, preventing downstream waste. |
| 4              | Protective Coating   | - Apply protective coating<br>- Dry coating                                                                   | 08:01:30 to 08:01:45        | Post-assembly surface treatment phase using coating applicator and dryer (Heating Unit #2). Events are paired (application requires drying); represents finishing to protect the welded product. Machine-dominated, short duration (~15s). |
| 5              | Final Inspection     | - Visual check                                                                                      | 08:02:00                    | Concluding human validation of the complete product (post-coating). Operator C performs holistic check ("Passed"); acts as gatekeeper before potential packaging/shipment. Isolated event marking workflow completion. |

### Additional Insights
- **Workflow Visualization**: The full process per case takes ~2 minutes, with steps in strict linear order: Preparation  Assembly  Partial QC  Finishing  Final QC.
- **Scalability**: These groupings apply universally to the log pattern (identical for A1/B2). For a full log, apply per CaseID by matching activity sequences and timestamps.
- **Potential Enhancements**: Future analysis could use thresholds (e.g., group if t < 30s and Activity keyword similarity > 70%) or ML clustering for automation.
- **Benefits**: Reduces ~12 low-level events to 5 high-level steps, revealing the workflow as "Prepare  Weld  Inspect Weld  Coat  Inspect Final" for easier bottleneck analysis (e.g., welding is fastest; gaps indicate waits).
