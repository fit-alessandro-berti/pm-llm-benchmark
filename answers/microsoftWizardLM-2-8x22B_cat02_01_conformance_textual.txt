 Upon reviewing the event log against the normative process description, we can identify the following violations:

**Case 2 Violations:**
- The activity "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the rule that payment should be authorized after checking inventory and before packaging.
- The sequence also implies that "Authorize payment" occurred after "Ship order," which is another violation. Payment authorization should be done before shipping.

**Case 3 Violations:**
- "Ship order" activity occurs after "Cancel order." According to the normative process, once an order is canceled, it should not proceed to shipping.
- The "Authorize payment" activity is unnecessary and out of order in this case. Since the inventory was insufficient and the order was canceled, authorizing payment should not have occurred at all.

**Case 5 Violations:**
- The "Package items" activity is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." According to the normative process, items should be packaged before they are shipped.

To summarize:

- **Case 1** follows the normative process correctly for a scenario where the inventory is sufficient to fulfill the order.
- **Case 2** violates the process by packaging items before authorizing payment and authorizing payment after shipping.
- **Case 3** violates the process by shipping an order after it has been canceled and by authorizing payment unnecessarily.
- **Case 4** correctly follows the normative process for an insufficient inventory scenario.
- **Case 5** violates the process by skipping the "Package items" activity before shipping.

In interpreting these cases, we must consider that the normative process allows for no deviations in the sequence of steps when inventory is sufficient or insufficient. The rules are clear that payment authorization must precede packaging, and packaging must precede shipping. Additionally, once an order is canceled, no further fulfillment activities should occur, and the process should conclude with closing the order. Any sequence that deviates from these rules, as seen in cases 2, 3, and 5, is considered a violation of the intended process flow.
