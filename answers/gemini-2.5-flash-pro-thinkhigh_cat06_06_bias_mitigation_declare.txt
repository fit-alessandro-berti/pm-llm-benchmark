Here is the updated DECLARE model with added bias-mitigating constraints, along with a detailed rationale for the changes.

### Updated `declare_model`

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        # Note: The new activities CheckSensitiveAttribute and ManualReview are not
        # added here, as they are not required to exist in every single trace.
        # They are only constrained to appear under specific circumstances.
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # --- BIAS MITIGATION CONSTRAINTS START ---
        "CheckSensitiveAttribute": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
        # --- BIAS MITIGATION CONSTRAINTS END ---
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # --- BIAS MITIGATION CONSTRAINTS START ---
        "CheckSensitiveAttribute": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
        # --- BIAS MITIGATION CONSTRAINTS END ---
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        # --- BIAS MITIGATION CONSTRAINTS START ---
        "CheckSensitiveAttribute": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
        # --- BIAS MITIGATION CONSTRAINTS END ---
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}

```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

To mitigate potential bias in the loan application process, we have introduced two new conceptual activities and three corresponding constraints. The new activities are:

*   **`CheckSensitiveAttribute`**: Represents any action where a sensitive attribute of the applicant (e.g., race, age, gender) is accessed or recorded.
*   **`ManualReview`**: Represents a mandatory secondary check or a four-eyes principle review, specifically designed to ensure fairness and justify the final decision.

The following constraints were added to the model to enforce a fair process:

1.  **`coexistence("CheckSensitiveAttribute", "ManualReview")`**
    *   **Location:** Added to the `coexistence` dictionary.
    *   **Purpose:** This constraint mandates that if a `CheckSensitiveAttribute` activity occurs in a process instance, then a `ManualReview` activity must also occur in that same instance (and vice-versa).
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** It ensures that any case where sensitive data is accessed is automatically flagged for additional scrutiny. This creates an auditable trail and prevents such cases from being processed without a dedicated fairness check.

2.  **`response("CheckSensitiveAttribute", "ManualReview")`**
    *   **Location:** Added to the `response` dictionary.
    *   **Purpose:** This constraint strengthens the `coexistence` rule by adding a temporal order. It requires that if `CheckSensitiveAttribute` occurs, it must eventually be followed by a `ManualReview`.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** This ensures the fairness check (`ManualReview`) happens *after* the sensitive data has been observed, allowing the reviewer to specifically assess whether the data improperly influenced subsequent steps.

3.  **`nonsuccession("CheckSensitiveAttribute", "FinalDecision")`**
    *   **Location:** Added to the `nonsuccession` dictionary.
    *   **Purpose:** This constraint forbids the `FinalDecision` activity from occurring *immediately* after the `CheckSensitiveAttribute` activity.
    *   **Bias Mitigation:** This is a critical "cooling-off" constraint that prevents a direct, potentially reflexive, decision based on sensitive information. It forces at least one other activity (such as the mandated `ManualReview`) to take place between observing the sensitive attribute and making the final decision, thereby promoting a more considered and justifiable outcome.
