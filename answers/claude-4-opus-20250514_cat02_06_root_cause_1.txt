## Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

### 1. Case Resolution Time Analysis

First, let me calculate the total resolution time for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | Hours |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|-------|
| 101 | 2024-03-01 08:00 | 2024-03-01 10:15 | 2h 15m | 2.25 |
| 102 | 2024-03-01 08:05 | 2024-03-02 09:15 | 25h 10m | 25.17 |
| 103 | 2024-03-01 08:10 | 2024-03-01 09:30 | 1h 20m | 1.33 |
| 104 | 2024-03-01 08:20 | 2024-03-02 08:30 | 24h 10m | 24.17 |
| 105 | 2024-03-01 08:25 | 2024-03-03 09:30 | 49h 5m | 49.08 |

**Cases with significantly longer resolution times:**
- **Case 105**: 49.08 hours (extremely high)
- **Case 102**: 25.17 hours (high)
- **Case 104**: 24.17 hours (high)

The average resolution time for cases without major delays (101, 103) is approximately 1.8 hours, making the delayed cases 13-27 times longer.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

#### A. **Escalation Impact**

Cases with escalations (102, 105) show significantly longer resolution times:
- **Case 102**: Escalated to Level-2 after 3.5 hours, adding significant delay
- **Case 105**: Escalated to Level-2 after just 50 minutes of Level-1 investigation

**Pattern**: Escalated tickets take 25-49 hours vs. 1.3-24 hours for non-escalated tickets.

#### B. **Process Bottlenecks and Delays**

**Case 102 Issues:**
- 2.5-hour wait between escalation (11:30) and investigation restart (14:00)
- 19-hour overnight delay between investigation (14:00) and resolution (09:00 next day)

**Case 104 Issues:**
- 40-minute delay for triage (vs. 5-15 minutes for others)
- 3.5-hour wait between assignment (09:30) and investigation (13:00)
- 19-hour overnight delay between investigation and resolution

**Case 105 Issues:**
- 28-hour wait between escalation (10:00) and Level-2 investigation (14:00 next day)
- Another 19-hour delay between investigation and resolution

#### C. **Timing Patterns**

- Tickets starting investigation after 13:00 consistently experience overnight delays
- Level-2 escalations show extreme waiting times (2.5-28 hours before investigation)

### 3. Insights and Recommendations

#### **Key Performance Issues:**

1. **Level-2 Resource Constraint**: The most critical bottleneck appears to be Level-2 agent availability, with wait times of up to 28 hours after escalation.

2. **End-of-Day Effect**: Investigations starting after 13:00 are not resolved same-day, suggesting either shift limitations or complexity requiring extended time.

3. **Inconsistent Triage Times**: Case 104's 40-minute triage time suggests potential process inconsistency.

#### **Recommendations:**

1. **Improve Level-2 Capacity**:
   - Increase Level-2 agent staffing
   - Implement an escalation queue monitoring system
   - Set SLA targets for escalation response (e.g., within 2 hours)

2. **Optimize Shift Coverage**:
   - Extend support hours or implement overlapping shifts
   - Prioritize completion of in-progress investigations before shift end
   - Consider 24/7 coverage for critical escalations

3. **Enhance Level-1 Capabilities**:
   - Provide additional training to reduce escalation rates
   - Implement knowledge base to help Level-1 agents resolve more issues independently
   - Review escalation criteria to ensure only necessary cases are escalated

4. **Process Improvements**:
   - Standardize triage process to ensure consistent 5-15 minute completion
   - Implement automated alerts for tickets waiting >2 hours at any stage
   - Create escalation protocols that include immediate notification to available Level-2 agents

5. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Analyze common escalation reasons to identify training opportunities
   - Implement ticket complexity scoring at triage to better route tickets initially

By addressing these bottlenecks, particularly the Level-2 capacity issue and end-of-day delays, the organization could potentially reduce average resolution time by 50-80% for complex tickets.
