To build a realistic model of the global supply chain process, I started by considering the logical sequence of events and the expected time spans between them. At the very beginning, choosing a supplier and placing an order are tightly coupled, so I assigned them a relatively short average interval with some variability. Once the order is placed, the actual receipt of components is subject to supplier lead times, so the gap widens considerably. After receiving, quality inspection typically happens quickly, but there's still some variation due to inspection thoroughness.

Assembly and testing are core manufacturing steps. Assembly can vary in duration depending on product complexity, while testing, especially for high-tech electronics, can take longer and has a wide spread in timing. Packaging tends to be faster and more consistent, but warehouse storage can be unpredictable due to fluctuating demand. Distribution, involving logistics and shipping, is inherently variable, while after-sales support often happens much later and with high variability, reflecting the unpredictable nature of post-sale issues.

For pairs that aren't directly connected but still follow each other in the process, I considered the cumulative effect of all intermediate steps. For example, the gap between placing an order and receiving components incorporates supplier lead times, while the gap between placing an order and assembly includes both procurement and inspection. As the chain lengthens, both the average times and the standard deviations increase, reflecting compounding uncertainties.

Here's the resulting temporal profile dictionary:

This dictionary captures the expected time delays and variability between all relevant pairs of activities in the supply chain, considering both direct and indirect relationships.
