**Rationale for the Added Constraints:**

1. **Coexistence (CheckApplicantRace–ManualReview)**:  
   By requiring `ManualReview` whenever `CheckApplicantRace` occurs, we ensure that any case involving sensitive demographic information undergoes an additional layer of human review. This reduces the likelihood of automated bias influencing the final decision.

2. **Response (CheckApplicantRace–BiasMitigationCheck)**:  
   The `response` constraint ensures that after sensitive attributes are examined, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must follow. This step is designed to detect and mitigate potential biases before proceeding to the final decision stage.

3. **Precedence (BiasMitigationCheck–FinalDecision)**:  
   By enforcing that `FinalDecision` is preceded by `BiasMitigationCheck`, the process ensures that the final verdict on the loan application is only made after potential biases have been identified and addressed, preventing snap decisions driven by sensitive attributes.

4. **Non-succession (CheckApplicantRace–FinalDecision)**:  
   Disallowing `FinalDecision` to immediately follow `CheckApplicantRace` provides a buffer. This ensures that the system or reviewers have a chance to apply corrective actions (such as `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`) in between, reducing the likelihood of discriminatory outcomes.

Overall, these additional constraints integrate fairness checks and manual oversight into the decision-making process, helping to ensure that sensitive information does not lead to biased loan approval or rejection outcomes.
