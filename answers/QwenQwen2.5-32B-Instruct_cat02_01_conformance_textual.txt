Based on the normative process description and the event log provided, let's evaluate each case and identify any deviations from the intended process flow.

### Case 1:
- **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
- **Violation:** None. This sequence follows the normative process correctly when inventory is sufficient.

### Case 2:
- **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
- **Violation:** The sequence "Package items" before "Authorize payment" is incorrect. According to the normative process, payment authorization should occur before packaging items.

### Case 3:
- **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
- **Violation:** There are two violations here:
  1. "Authorize payment" should not occur before "Cancel order."
  2. "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order."

### Case 4:
- **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
- **Violation:** None. This sequence follows the normative process correctly when inventory is insufficient.

### Case 5:
- **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
- **Violation:** The process lacks the "Package items" activity between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." This is a violation as items must be packaged before being shipped.

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2:** Violation in the sequence of activities: "Package items" before "Authorize payment."
- **Case 3:** Violations include:
  - "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order."
  - "Ship order" after "Cancel order."
- **Case 5:** Violation in the sequence of activities: Missing "Package items" activity before "Ship order."

These deviations from the normative process indicate that there are issues with the order handling process in Cases 2, 3, and 5.
