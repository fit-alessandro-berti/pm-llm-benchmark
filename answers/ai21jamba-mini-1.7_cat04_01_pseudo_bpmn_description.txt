### Detailed Explanation of the Business Process

The pseudo-BPMN representation details a workflow for handling customer requests, distinguishing between **Standard** and **Custom** request types. Below is an explanation of each step, the purpose of gateways, and how the process flows based on request type and approval needs.

#### **1. Start Event and Initial Task**

- **Start Event:** Marks the beginning of the process upon receiving a customer request.
- **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
	- This step involves capturing the customer's request details, which determines the path the process will follow.

#### **2. Gateway 1: Request Type Check**

- **Task B1 (Standard Path)**: "Perform Standard Validation"
	- If the request is **Standard**, the process follows this branch. Standard requests are simpler and follow predefined validation criteria.
	- **Validation Steps**:
		- **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
			- Ensures the customer's creditworthiness, essential for confirming the request's feasibility.
		- **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
			- Confirms that the required products/services are available in inventory.
	- **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
		- After successful validation, the system calculates the delivery date based on standard timelines.
- **Task B2 (Custom Path)**: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"
	- If the request is **Custom**, this branch evaluates whether the customization requirements can be feasibly met.
	- **Custom Feasibility Check**:
		- Determines if the request's customizations align with the organization’s capabilities.

#### **3. Decision Points and Diverging Paths**

- **Gateway 2: "Is Customization Feasible?"**
	- For Custom requests, this gateway determines the next steps based on the feasibility result:
		- **If Feasible**: Proceeds to prepare a custom quotation.
		- **If Not Feasible**: Sends a rejection notice to the customer and ends the process.
- **Gateway 3: "Is Approval Needed?"**
	- For both Standard and Custom paths, this gateway evaluates whether managerial approval is required:
		- **If Approval is Needed**: The process halts for approval before proceeding.
		- **If Approval is Not Needed**: The process moves directly to final invoice generation.

#### **4. Approval Handling**

- **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
	- If approval is required, this step waits for managerial confirmation.
	- **Sub-gateway (Approval Granted or Not):**
		- **If Granted**: Proceeds to generate the final invoice.
		- **If Not Granted**: Re-evaluates the request conditions, looping back to the appropriate previous step:
			- For Custom requests, loops back to **Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation**.
			- For Standard requests, loops back to **Task D: Calculate Delivery Date**.

#### **5. Converging Paths and Final Steps**

- **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
	- Once all conditions are met (validation complete, feasibility confirmed, and approval obtained), the invoice is generated.
- **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
	- Completes the process by sending the customer a confirmation, finalizing the interaction.

#### **Key Differences Between Standard and Custom Paths**

1. **Standard Path:**
	- Simpler and shorter, focusing on basic credit and inventory checks.
	- No need for managerial approval or customization feasibility checks.
2. **Custom Path:**
	- Involves additional steps for feasibility analysis and managerial approval.
	- More prone to loops and rework, especially if the feasibility check or approval is not granted.

#### **Gateways Explained**

1. **Gateway 1 (XOR): Request Type Check**
	- A **XOR gateway** splits the flow into two exclusive paths based on the request type (**Standard** or **Custom**).
2. **Gateway 2 (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
	- Determines whether to proceed with preparing a quotation or reject the request.
3. **Gateway 3 (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
	- Decides whether the process requires approval before finalizing the invoice.
4. **Join Gateway (After Parallel Checks in Standard Path):**
	- Ensures all parallel validations (credit and inventory) are completed before proceeding to the next step.

#### **Conditions for Rework or Approval**

- **Re-evaluation (Looping Back):**
	- Triggered when approval is not granted. The process revisits earlier tasks based on the request type:
		- Custom requests loop back to **Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation)**.
		- Standard requests loop back to **Task D (Calculate Delivery Date)**.
- **Approval Needed:**
	- Only required for Custom requests or if a validation check fails during Standard requests, prompting managerial oversight.

### Summary

The process is designed to handle varying complexities in customer requests efficiently. Standard requests are streamlined, while Custom requests introduce additional layers of validation and decision-making. Gateways ensure logical branching and convergence, while loops accommodate rework when conditions are not met, maintaining process integrity and adaptability.
