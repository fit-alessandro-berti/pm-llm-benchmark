# Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Optimizing Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1 Individual Agent and Tier Performance Analysis

**Key Metrics Framework:**

**Agent-Level Metrics:**
- **Workload Distribution**: 
  - Number of tickets assigned per agent over time periods (daily/weekly/monthly)
  - Distribution of ticket priorities handled (P1-P4 ratios)
  - Category diversity (breadth vs. specialization)
  - Active working time vs. idle time analysis
  
- **Efficiency Metrics**:
  - Average handling time per ticket category
  - Time-to-first-response after assignment
  - Resolution time variance (standard deviation indicating consistency)
  - Tickets resolved per hour/day (throughput)
  
- **Quality Indicators**:
  - First-Call Resolution (FCR) rate for L1 agents
  - Reassignment rate (tickets reassigned after initial handling)
  - Escalation rate and reasons
  - Reopened ticket percentage
  - SLA compliance rate per agent

**Tier-Level Metrics:**
- **L1 Performance**: FCR rate, escalation percentage, average handling time for common categories, skill gap identification
- **L2/L3 Performance**: Specialized resolution time, tickets received from L1 vs. directly assigned, complexity handling efficiency
- **Cross-tier metrics**: Handover efficiency, communication quality indicators

**Implementation Approach:**

Using the event log, I would:

1. **Create Resource Performance Dashboards** by filtering and aggregating activities by Resource (Agent ID):
```
For each agent:
- Count: Activities WHERE Activity LIKE 'Work%Start' (assigned tickets)
- Calculate: TIMESTAMP_DIFF('Work End', 'Work Start') for handling time
- Count: Activities = 'Escalate' / Total tickets (escalation rate)
- Count: Cases with single L1 assignment + Resolved / Total L1 cases (FCR)
```

2. **Segment Analysis by Ticket Characteristics**:
   - Cross-tabulate agent performance against ticket priority (P1-P4)
   - Analyze handling times by Required Skill category
   - Identify which agents handle which skill requirements most frequently and efficiently

3. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**:
   - Hour-of-day/day-of-week workload patterns per agent
   - Identify peak load periods and agent availability alignment
   - Detect agents consistently working beyond capacity

### 1.2 Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Discovery

**Social Network Analysis (SNA) for Handover Patterns:**

Using "Handover of Work" metrics:
- Build a directed graph where nodes = agents, edges = ticket handovers
- Edge weight = frequency of handovers between specific agents
- Analyze:
  - **Clustering**: Are certain agents forming handover clusters? (indicates specialized teams forming naturally)
  - **Centrality measures**: High betweenness centrality agents may be coordination bottlenecks
  - **Handover frequency**: L1L2 transitions by agent pairs reveal which L1 agents most frequently need help from which L2 specialists

**Example Analysis:**
```
Filter events: Escalate/Reassign activities
Create pairs: (Previous Resource, Next Resource)
Aggregate: Count handover frequency
Visualize: Network diagram showing:
- Node size = total tickets handled
- Edge thickness = handover frequency
- Node color = tier level
```

**Role Discovery through Activity Pattern Mining:**

Rather than accepting the formal L1/L2/L3 structure, discover *actual* working roles:
- Cluster agents based on:
  - Activity profiles (which activities they perform)
  - Ticket category distributions they handle
  - Skill requirements of tickets they resolve
  
This may reveal:
- "De facto specialists" at L1 who handle specific categories very effectively
- L2 agents functioning more as general handlers than specialists
- Mismatch between official tier and actual work complexity

**Variant Analysis for Assignment Patterns:**

Identify process variants focused on assignment sequences:
- Variant 1: Created  Assign L1  Work L1  Resolved (ideal L1 path)
- Variant 2: Created  Assign L1  Work L1  Escalate L2  Assign L2  Work L2  Resolved
- Variant 3: Created  Assign L1  Work L1  Escalate L2  Assign L2  Work L2  Reassign  Assign L2  Work L2  Resolved (problematic)

For each variant:
- Calculate frequency, average duration, SLA compliance
- Analyze what ticket/agent characteristics lead to each path
- Compare intended vs. actual routing logic

### 1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis

**Creating Skill-Match Matrix:**

From the event log, extract for each ticket-agent pairing:
- Required Skill (from ticket attributes)
- Agent Skills (from agent profile)
- Match type: Perfect match, Partial match, Over-qualified, Under-qualified

**Analysis Questions:**

1. **Are specialists handling non-specialist work?**
   - Filter: Agents with advanced skills (e.g., 'Networking-Firewall')
   - Calculate: % of their tickets that require basic skills only
   - Example finding: "Agent B12 (App-CRM, DB-SQL specialist) spends 35% of time on tickets requiring only 'Basic-Troubleshoot'"

2. **Skill coverage gaps:**
   - Identify Required Skills with longest queue times
   - Compare to number of agents possessing those skills
   - Temporal analysis: Are certain skills understaffed during specific shifts?

3. **Cross-skilling opportunities:**
   - Analyze agents who successfully handle tickets outside their primary skill set
   - Identify "adjacent skills" frequently needed together
   - Example: "Tickets requiring 'App-CRM' often eventually need 'Database-SQL' (40% of cases)"

4. **Skill proficiency levels:**
   - Even if skill match exists, compare resolution times between agents with same skill
   - Identify expert vs. novice performance differences
   - Create proficiency tiers based on performance data

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### 2.1 Specific Problem Identification Framework

**A. Skill Availability Bottlenecks**

**Detection Method:**
```
1. Calculate queue time by Required Skill:
   Queue_Time = TIMESTAMP_DIFF('Assign Complete', 'Ticket Created' or 'Escalate Complete')
   
2. Group by Required Skill, calculate:
   - Average queue time
   - 95th percentile queue time
   - Number of agents with skill vs. ticket demand
   
3. Calculate utilization rate:
   Utilization = (Total working time for skill) / (Available agent-hours with skill)
```

**Quantified Finding Example:**
- "Networking-Firewall tickets wait average 47 minutes (vs. 12 min overall average) for L2 assignment"
- "Only 3 agents possess Networking-Firewall skill; utilization at 94% during peak hours (9AM-2PM)"
- "This bottleneck affects 18% of P2 tickets, contributing to 34% of P2 SLA breaches"

**B. Reassignment and Escalation Delays**

**Analysis Approach:**

1. **Identify reassignment patterns:**
```
Filter activities: 'Reassign'
For each case with reassignment:
- Count: Number of reassignments
- Calculate: Total delay = SUM(TIMESTAMP_DIFF between reassignment and next work start)
- Extract: Reasons from Notes field
- Categorize: Reassignment reasons (skill mismatch, workload balancing, agent unavailable)
```

2. **Measure impact:**
   - Average delay per reassignment: e.g., "Each reassignment adds 42 minutes average delay"
   - Cases with 2+ reassignments: e.g., "8% of cases have multiple reassignments, averaging 3.2 hours additional resolution time"
   - SLA impact: e.g., "Cases with any reassignment have 2.7x higher SLA breach rate"

**Quantified Finding Example:**
- "23% of all tickets experience at least one reassignment"
- "Reassignments add average 38 minutes per incident (range: 15-180 minutes)"
- "Primary reasons: Skill mismatch (45%), Agent became unavailable (28%), Workload rebalancing (27%)"
- "Cost impact: ~450 hours/month lost to reassignment delays"

**C. Incorrect Initial Assignment Analysis**

**Detection Method:**

Define "incorrect assignment" indicators:
- Assignment followed by reassignment within work session
- Escalation immediately after minimal work time (<5 minutes)
- Agent lacks required skill according to profile

```
Calculate "First-Time-Right" rate:
FTR_Rate = Cases resolved by first assigned agent / Total cases

Analyze by:
- Initial dispatcher/assignment method
- Ticket category
- Time of day (dispatcher workload impact)
```

**Quantified Finding Example:**
- "First-Time-Right rate: 61% (meaning 39% require reassignment or escalation)"
- "L1 dispatching during peak hours (10-11AM) has 48% FTR rate vs. 72% during off-peak"
- "Manual dispatcher assignments have 67% FTR vs. 58% for round-robin auto-assignment"
- "Categories with lowest FTR: Security-IAM (43%), Network (51%)"

**D. Agent Performance Variance**

**Identification Method:**

1. **Statistical outlier detection:**
   - Calculate mean and standard deviation for key metrics across agents in same tier
   - Identify outliers (>2 standard deviations from mean)
   
2. **Comparative analysis:**
```
For each agent in L1:
- Resolution_Rate = Resolved_at_L1 / Total_Handled
- Avg_Handling_Time by category
- SLA_Compliance_Rate

Compare to tier averages, identify:
- Underperformers (slow, low FCR, high escalation)
- Overperformers (fast, high FCR, low escalation)
- Overloaded (high volume, declining performance trend)
```

**Quantified Finding Example:**
- "Top quartile L1 agents: 68% FCR rate, 22 min avg handling time"
- "Bottom quartile L1 agents: 31% FCR rate, 47 min avg handling time"
- "3 agents (A02, A08, A12) handle 42% of all L1 volume, showing declining performance trend"
- "5 agents show <60% utilization despite high queue backlog"

**E. SLA Breach Correlation Analysis**

**Method:**

Create a decision tree or regression model with SLA breach as target variable:
```
Predictor variables:
- Initial assignment tier
- Skill match quality (perfect/partial/none)
- Agent workload at assignment time
- Number of reassignments
- Time in queue before first assignment
- Ticket priority and category
- Time of day/week assigned
```

**Quantified Finding Example:**
- "SLA breach probability increases by 23% for each reassignment"
- "Skill mismatch in initial assignment increases breach probability by 47%"
- "Queue time >30 minutes accounts for 56% of P2 breaches"
- "L1 escalations after >45 min work have 71% breach rate vs. 18% for quick escalations"
- "Combined effect: Skill mismatch + reassignment + high queue time = 89% breach probability"

### 2.2 Bottleneck Visualization and Quantification

**Process Map Overlays:**

Create process maps with resource-focused coloring:
- **Heat map by waiting time**: Color activities/paths by average queue time
- **Performance heat map**: Color resources by throughput or SLA compliance
- **Frequency heat map**: Line thickness showing reassignment frequency

**Resource Calendar Analysis:**

Plot ticket arrival rate vs. available staff by skill:
- Hourly heatmap showing: Demand for "Networking-Firewall" skill vs. agents with this skill on duty
- Identify temporal mismatches: "Peak Network ticket arrival 2-4PM, but only 1 specialist scheduled"

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Assignment Rule Deficiencies

**Analysis Approach:**

**Reverse-engineer current logic from event log patterns:**

```
Extract assignment patterns:
1. Time between 'Assign' activity and previous activities
2. Agent selected correlation with:
   - Last assigned agent
   - Agent idle time
   - Ticket characteristics
   - Sequential agent IDs (indicating round-robin)
```

**Findings might reveal:**

1. **Pure round-robin regardless of context:**
   - Evidence: Agent IDs cycle sequentially regardless of ticket type
   - Problem: "Network tickets assigned to agents without networking skills 34% of the time"
   - Root cause: Assignment logic ignores skill requirements

2. **No workload awareness:**
   - Evidence: New assignments occur to agents already handling 5+ active tickets
   - Problem: "Agent B12 receives new assignment while handling 7 tickets; Agent B15 idle"
   - Root cause: Assignment based on rotation, not current capacity

3. **Lack of priority consideration:**
   - Evidence: P1 tickets wait in queue behind P3 tickets
   - Problem: "P1 tickets wait average 8 minutes vs. P4 at 6 minutes (no significant difference)"
   - Root cause: FIFO queue regardless of priority

4. **Static tier boundaries:**
   - Evidence: Capable L1 agents never receive complex tickets even when L2 busy
   - Problem: "L1 Agent A05 demonstrates 82% success rate on Software-App tickets requiring App-CRM skill, but these always escalate to L2 per policy"
   - Root cause: Rigid tier definitions prevent flexible assignment

### 3.2 Data Quality Issues

**Agent Skill Profile Accuracy:**

**Detection Method:**
```
Compare documented skills vs. actual performance:

For each agent:
- Extract tickets successfully resolved
- Identify required skills for those tickets
- Compare to documented skill set
- Flag: Skills used but not documented, Skills documented but never used
```

**Quantified Findings Example:**
- "12 agents successfully resolve tickets requiring skills not in their official profile"
- "8 agents have skills listed that they've never applied (possibly outdated)"
- "Agent B08 listed with 'Basic-Troubleshoot' only, but successfully resolves 'Networking-Router' tickets 73% of time"
- Root cause: Skill profiles not updated after training, informal learning, or based on hiring assumptions rather than actual capability

**Ticket Categorization Accuracy:**

**Detection Method:**
```
Analyze cases with reassignments:
- Compare initial Category vs. Required Skill
- Track if category changed during reassignment
- Correlate categorization errors with entry channel (phone vs. web vs. email)
```

**Quantified Findings Example:**
- "18% of tickets have Required Skill changed during first L2 assignment"
- "Phone-logged tickets have 27% higher reassignment rate (likely due to hasty initial categorization)"
- "Category 'Software-App' is too broad: leads to misassignment 41% of time"
- Root cause: Insufficient information gathering at ticket creation, overly broad categories, lack of categorization guidelines

### 3.3 Visibility and Information Gaps

**Real-time Workload Visibility:**

**Evidence from log:**
```
Analyze assignment timestamps:
- Does assignment consider tickets already assigned to agent but not yet completed?
- Calculate: Agent's active ticket count at moment of new assignment
- Correlation: Agent's current workload vs. performance on new ticket
```

**Findings:**
- "No evidence of workload checking: agents receive new assignments regardless of queue"
- "Agent performance degrades significantly when handling >4 concurrent tickets (avg resolution time increases 73%)"
- Root cause: Dispatchers/system lack real-time view of agent workload

**Skill Availability Visibility:**

**Evidence:**
- "Queue times vary dramatically even for same skill requirement at similar times"
- "Manual dispatcher assignments show better skill-matching than automated"
- Root cause: Automated system lacks sophisticated skill-matching logic; manual dispatchers use informal knowledge but inconsistently

### 3.4 Process and Training Gaps

**L1 Empowerment Analysis:**

**Variant Comparison Method:**
```
Compare two cohorts:
Cohort A: Tickets resolved at L1 (no escalation)
Cohort B: Similar tickets (same category, priority) escalated to L2

Analyze:
- What's different? Agent? Ticket characteristics? Time factors?
- Could Cohort B have been resolved at L1?
```

**Quantified Findings:**
- "47% of escalated Software-App tickets are resolved by L2 in <10 minutes using only basic troubleshooting steps"
- "L1 agents A03, A07, A11 escalate 82% of tickets vs. A05, A09 who escalate only 38%"
- "Post-escalation analysis shows 31% of L1 escalations involved issues within L1 capability scope"

**Root Causes:**
1. **Training gaps**: Some L1 agents lack confidence or knowledge for issues within scope
2. **Risk aversion**: Policy/culture encourages escalation over resolution attempts
3. **Unclear boundaries**: L1 agents uncertain about their authority scope
4. **Inadequate knowledge base**: L1 lacks resources to solve solvable issues
5. **Insufficient time**: Pressure to clear queue leads to premature escalation

### 3.5 Decision Mining for Assignment Decisions

**Approach: Build Predictive Model for Assignment Outcomes**

**Target Variable:** Assignment Success (1 = resolved by assigned agent, 0 = reassigned/escalated)

**Features (extracted from event log):**
- Agent characteristics: Tier, skills, current workload, historical performance
- Ticket characteristics: Priority, category, required skill, channel, time
- Contextual factors: Queue length, time of day, recent escalation rate

**Analysis Process:**
```
1. Train decision tree classifier on historical assignments
2. Examine decision rules that predict unsuccessful assignments
3. Identify factors most strongly associated with reassignment
```

**Example Decision Rules Discovered:**
```
IF Required_Skill NOT IN Agent_Skills AND Ticket_Priority = 'P2' 
   THEN Reassignment_Probability = 87%

IF Agent_Current_Workload > 5 AND Time_of_Day BETWEEN 10-12 
   THEN Resolution_Time > SLA_Probability = 72%

IF Ticket_Category = 'Security-IAM' AND Agent_Tier = 'L1' 
   THEN Escalation_Probability = 94%

IF Agent_Experience_Days < 90 AND Ticket_Priority IN ['P1','P2']
   THEN Assignment_Success_Probability = 42%
```

**Root Causes Identified:**
- Skill matching is critical predictor but not currently used
- Workload level strongly predicts failure but not considered
- Certain category-tier combinations almost always fail
- Agent experience matters for high-priority tickets but not factored in

### 3.6 Variant Analysis: Smooth vs. Problematic Cases

**Method:**

**Define variants by assignment path complexity:**
- **Variant Class A** (Smooth): Created  Assign  Work  Resolve (1 assignment)
- **Variant Class B** (One escalation): Created  Assign L1  Work L1  Escalate  Assign L2  Work L2  Resolve
- **Variant Class C** (Problematic): Multiple reassignments, returns to lower tier, 3+ assignments

**Comparative Analysis:**
```
For each variant class:
- Ticket characteristics distribution
- Agent characteristics
- Time factors
- Outcome measures (resolution time, SLA compliance, customer satisfaction)

Statistical comparison:
- What distinguishes Class A from Class C tickets?
- Are differences in ticket nature or assignment decisions?
```

**Example Findings:**

**Class A (Smooth) characteristics:**
- 73% have perfect skill match on initial assignment
- Average agent workload at assignment: 2.3 tickets
- 89% SLA compliance
- Average resolution time: 1.2 hours

**Class C (Problematic) characteristics:**
- Only 31% have skill match on initial assignment
- Average agent workload at assignment: 5.7 tickets
- 23% SLA compliance
- Average resolution time: 8.7 hours
- 67% show evidence of "incorrect" initial categorization

**Root Cause Synthesis:**
Problematic paths are NOT primarily due to inherently difficult tickets, but rather:
1. Poor initial skill matching (correctable with better assignment logic)
2. Overloaded agents receiving assignments (correctable with workload awareness)
3. Categorization errors propagating through system (correctable with better intake process)

**Key Insight:** Variant analysis reveals that a large portion of complex, problematic case paths could have been simpler with better initial assignment decisions.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Intelligent Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

**Problem Addressed:**
- Current round-robin ignores skill requirements leading to 39% reassignment rate
- Specialists handling non-specialist work (35% of specialist time wasted)
- Skill mismatches primary cause of SLA breaches

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- Skill-requirement analysis showing specific skills associated with ticket categories
- Agent performance data revealing proficiency levels beyond binary "has skill/doesn't have skill"
- Handover network analysis showing which skill transitions are common
- Resolution time analysis by agent-skill pairing showing expertise variance

**Implementation Design:**

**A. Enhanced Skill Taxonomy**

Build multi-dimensional skill model from data:
```
Skill Definition:
- Skill_Name: e.g., "Networking-Firewall"
- Proficiency_Level: Novice (1), Intermediate (2), Advanced (3), Expert (4)
- Recency: Days since last used
- Success_Rate: % of tickets with this skill successfully resolved
- Avg_Resolution_Time: Performance metric
```

**Proficiency Level Calculation (Data-Driven):**
```
For Agent X and Skill Y:
1. Filter tickets requiring Skill Y handled by Agent X
2. Calculate:
   - Success_rate = Resolved_without_reassignment / Total_handled
   - Speed_score = (Avg_resolution_time_all_agents / Agent_X_resolution_time)
   - Volume_score = Log(number_of_tickets_handled)
   
3. Proficiency_Score = (Success_rate * 0.5) + (Speed_score * 0.3) + (Volume_score * 0.2)

4. Assign Level:
   - Expert (4): Score > 0.85
   - Advanced (3): Score 0.70-0.85
   - Intermediate (2): Score 0.50-0.70
   - Novice (1): Score < 0.50
```

**B. Dynamic Skill Matching Algorithm**

```
When new ticket arrives:

1. EXTRACT required_skills from ticket:
   - Primary: From category mapping (derived from historical data)
   - Secondary: Predicted from description (if NLP available)
   - Complexity_score: Based on priority, category, historical patterns

2. BUILD candidate pool:
   - Filter agents with primary skill
   - Include agents in appropriate tier (with flexibility rules)
   
3. SCORE each candidate:
   Score = (Skill_Proficiency * 0.35) + 
           (Workload_Factor * 0.25) +
           (Availability_Factor * 0.20) +
           (SLA_Buffer * 0.10) +
           (Recent_Performance * 0.10)
   
   Where:
   - Skill_Proficiency: Agent's proficiency level for required skill (1-4)
   - Workload_Factor: 4 - (Current_active_tickets / Max_capacity)
   - Availability_Factor: 4 if available now, 2 if available in <15min, 0 otherwise
   - SLA_Buffer: (Agent_avg_resolution_time for this category) < (SLA_time_remaining)
   - Recent_Performance: Last 10 tickets' success rate (0-4 scale)

4. SELECT top-scored agent

5. ESCALATION RULES:
   - If no candidates score > 2.0, escalate to next tier
   - If P1 ticket and no expert available, pull expert from current work
```

**C. Cross-Tier Flexibility**

```
Allow skilled L1 agents to handle L2 work:
- IF: L1 agent has Expert proficiency in required skill
- AND: L2 queue length > threshold (e.g., >5 tickets)
- AND: Ticket complexity_score < 7 (scale 1-10)
- THEN: Assign to L1 expert instead of L2

Prevents: "Artificial" escalations just due to policy
```

**Data Required:**
1. **Historical performance data**: Resolution times, success rates by agent-skill-category combinations
2. **Real-time workload data**: Current active tickets per agent
3. **Agent availability**: Current status (available, busy, break, etc.)
4. **Ticket attributes**: Category, priority, required skills, complexity indicators
5. **SLA parameters**: Time allowances by priority/category

**Expected Benefits:**

**Quantified Projections (based on simulation):**
- **Reduce reassignments by 60%**: From 23% to ~9% of tickets
  - Calculation: 60% of current reassignments due to skill mismatch
  - Impact: Save ~270 hours/month (450 hours * 0.60)
  
- **Improve First-Time-Right rate**: From 61% to ~82%
  - Based on: Perfect skill matching + workload consideration
  
- **Reduce specialist time on non-specialist work**: From 35% to <10%
  - Free up ~40 hours/week of specialist capacity
  - Equivalent to adding 1 FTE specialist

- **Improve SLA compliance**: From current rate to +15 percentage points
  - Address 47% of breaches currently caused by skill mismatch
  - Address delay time from reduced reassignments

- **Balance workload**: Standard deviation of workload across agents reduced by 40%

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Build skill proficiency database from historical data
2. **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Implement scoring algorithm in parallel with current system
3. **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Pilot with specific ticket categories (e.g., Software-App)
4. **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Full rollout with monitoring
5. **Phase 5** (Ongoing): Monthly proficiency recalculation and algorithm tuning

---

### Strategy 2: Predictive Assignment with Complexity-Based Routing

**Problem Addressed:**
- 31% of L1 escalations involve issues within L1 capability (unnecessary escalations)
- Unclear which tickets are "simple" vs "complex" at intake
- P1/P2 tickets not receiving appropriately experienced agents
- Some tickets incorrectly routed to L1 when they clearly need specialist

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- Variant analysis showing paths of simple vs. complex tickets
- Decision mining revealing factors predicting escalation/reassignment
- Time-to-resolution patterns by ticket characteristics
- L1 resolution success patterns by ticket attributes

**Implementation Design:**

**A. Ticket Complexity Prediction Model**

Build machine learning model trained on historical data:

```
MODEL: Ticket Complexity Classifier
TARGET: Complexity_Level (1-10 scale or categories: Simple/Moderate/Complex)

FEATURES (from ticket at creation):
Structured attributes:
- Priority (P1-P4)
- Category
- Subcategory
- Channel (Phone/Email/Portal)
- Requestor department/VIP status
- Time of day/day of week
- Attached files count/type

Text features (from description):
- Keyword presence (error codes, specific applications, infrastructure components)
- Description length
- Question marks count (uncertainty indicator)
- Polarity (positive/negative/urgent language)

Historical contextual:
- Similar tickets' resolution paths
- Requestor's ticket history (repeat issues)
- Asset history if asset-related

TRAINING LABELS (derived from historical data):
Complexity = f(
  Resolution_tier, # L1=1, L2=5, L3=9
  Number_of_reassignments,
  Total_resolution_time,
  Number_of_agents_involved,
  Escalations_count
)

Simple (1-3): Resolved at L1, <30 min, single agent
Moderate (4-6): L1 escalation to L2, <2 hours, 2 agents
Complex (7-10): Multiple tiers, >2 hours, 3+ agents or specialists
```

**B. Complexity-Based Routing Logic**

```
Upon ticket creation:

1. PREDICT complexity_score (1-10)

2. ROUTE based on predicted complexity + priority:

   IF complexity_score  3:
       Route to L1 (standard skill-based routing)
   
   IF complexity_score 4-6:
       If P1/P2: Route to experienced L1 agent or directly to L2
       If P3/P4: Route to L1 with flagging for proactive escalation
   
   IF complexity_score  7:
       If P1/P2: Route directly to L2/L3 specialist
       If P3/P4: Route to L2 with appropriate priority
   
   IF complexity_score  8 AND priority = P1:
       Route directly to L3 or most expert L2
       Notify management for possible major incident

3. SPECIAL RULES:
   - Override: Requestor is VIP + P1/P2  Always route to experienced agent
   - Pattern recognition: If similar to recent major incident  Route to team that handled it
   - Learning: If prediction wrong (quick resolution despite high score), feedback to model
```

**C. Confidence Scoring and Fallback**

```
Model outputs complexity prediction WITH confidence level:

IF confidence < 0.70:
    Route to L1 as default (conservative approach)
    Flag ticket for supervisor review of routing
    Track these cases for model improvement

IF confidence  0.70:
    Follow complexity-based routing
   
Track prediction accuracy:
- Actual_path vs. Predicted_path
- Retrain model quarterly with new data
```

**D. Enhanced L1 Decision Support**

For tickets routed to L1 despite moderate complexity:

```
Provide L1 agent with:
- Predicted complexity score and factors
- Similar resolved tickets (case-based reasoning)
- Suggested escalation timing: "If not resolved in X minutes, escalate to Y"
- Pre-identified likely specialist needed

Example:
"Complexity: 5/10 (Moderate)
Similar tickets took avg 45 min at L1 or required L2-Database specialist
Suggested: Attempt resolution for 20 minutes
If stuck, escalate to: Agent B15 (DB-SQL expert, currently available)"
```

**Data Required:**
1. **Historical ticket data**: Full lifecycle with all attributes and outcomes
2. **Training dataset**: Minimum 10,000 labeled tickets spanning all categories
3. **Real-time ticket attributes**: At creation, including text description
4. **Agent experience levels**: For routing high-complexity tickets
5. **Similar case database**: For case-based reasoning support
6. **Feedback loop**: Actual outcomes vs. predictions for continuous learning

**Expected Benefits:**

**Quantified Projections:**

- **Reduce inappropriate L1 assignments**: 
  - Currently: Complex tickets routed to L1 then escalated (wasting ~25 min average)
  - Target: 70% of complex tickets bypass L1 directly
  - Impact: Save ~180 hours/month, improve P1/P2 SLA compliance by 12%

- **Reduce unnecessary escalations**:
  - Currently: 31% of escalations unnecessary
  - Target: Reduce to 15% through better L1 decision support
  - Impact: Reduce L2 workload by ~16%, free capacity for true specialist work

- **Faster resolution for complex tickets**:
  - Currently: Complex P2 tickets take avg 6.2 hours (including L1 time)
  - Target: 4.3 hours (by routing directly to appropriate resource)
  - Impact: 30% reduction in resolution time for complex tickets

- **Improved L1 efficiency**:
  - Less time on issues beyond capability
  - Higher confidence in escalation decisions
  - Expected: L1 FCR rate improvement from 61% to 73%

- **Better specialist utilization**:
  - L2/L3 receive pre-qualified complex cases
  - Less time sorting through escalated simple issues
  - Expected: L2/L3 throughput increases 20%

**Model Performance Targets:**
- Prediction accuracy: >75% (complexity within 2 points of actual)
- Precision for "Complex" class: >80% (if predict complex, truly complex)

### Strategy 3: Dynamic Workload-Aware Assignment with Real-Time Optimization

**Problem Addressed:**
- Uneven workload distribution (some agents 94% utilized, others <60%)
- Agents receive new assignments despite already handling 7+ tickets
- Peak hour mismatches (demand for skills vs. available staff)
- No consideration of "about to be available" agents
- Queue times vary dramatically due to unoptimized assignment

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- Temporal analysis showing demand patterns by hour/day/skill
- Workload correlation with performance degradation (>4 tickets = 73% slower)
- Agent idle time analysis revealing underutilization
- Queue time analysis by skill and time of day
- Agent availability patterns (breaks, meetings, training)

**Implementation Design:**

**A. Real-Time Workload Tracking System**

```
AGENT STATE MODEL (updated in real-time):

For each agent, maintain:
{
  agent_id: "B12",
  current_state: "Working", # Available, Working, Break, Meeting, Training, Offline
  
  current_workload: {
    active_tickets: 3,
    active_ticket_ids: ["INC-5001", "INC-5023", "INC-5087"],
    estimated_completion_times: [15, 32, 8], # minutes to expected completion
    total_estimated_minutes: 55
  },
  
  capacity_metrics: {
    max_concurrent_tickets: 5, # Based on historical performance analysis
    current_utilization: 0.60, # 3/5
    efficiency_score: 0.92, # Recent performance vs. baseline
    stress_indicator: 0.45 # 0-1 scale, based on ticket velocity and complexity
  },
  
  availability_forecast: {
    becoming_available_in: 8, # minutes until next ticket likely resolved
    scheduled_break_in: 45, # minutes
    scheduled_offline_in: 180 # end of shift
  },
  
  recent_performance: {
    last_10_tickets_avg_time: 28, # minutes
    last_10_tickets_success_rate: 0.90,
    current_session_start: "2025-04-20 08:00:00",
    tickets_handled_today: 12
  }
}
```

**B. Intelligent Assignment Queue Management**

```
TICKET QUEUE PRIORITIZATION:

Instead of simple FIFO, maintain priority queue with dynamic scoring:

For each waiting ticket:
  Queue_Priority_Score = 
    (Priority_Weight * 40) +        # P1=10, P2=7, P3=4, P4=1
    (SLA_Urgency * 30) +             # (Time_remaining_to_SLA_breach)^-1, scaled
    (Wait_Time * 20) +               # Minutes already waiting
    (Skill_Scarcity * 10)            # Inverse of # agents with required skill

Tickets with higher scores processed first for assignment
```

**C. Predictive Assignment Algorithm with Look-Ahead**

```
ASSIGNMENT DECISION ENGINE:

When assigning ticket to agent, optimize across entire queue:

FUNCTION assign_optimal_agent(ticket, available_agents):
  
  # 1. Build candidate pool
  candidates = []
  FOR each agent in available_agents:
    IF agent.has_required_skill(ticket):
      candidates.add(agent)
  
  # 2. Consider "about to be available" agents
  about_to_be_free = []
  FOR each agent in busy_agents:
    IF agent.estimated_completion_time < 10 minutes:
      about_to_be_free.add(agent)
  
  # 3. Score each candidate
  best_score = -infinity
  best_agent = None
  
  FOR each candidate in (candidates + about_to_be_free):
    
    # Base assignment score
    score = calculate_skill_match_score(candidate, ticket)
    
    # Workload penalty
    workload_penalty = (candidate.current_workload.active_tickets / candidate.max_concurrent) * 3
    score -= workload_penalty
    
    # Performance adjustment
    if candidate.efficiency_score > 0.85:
      score += 1.5
    if candidate.stress_indicator > 0.75:
      score -= 2.0
    
    # Availability timing
    if candidate.current_state == "Available":
      score += 3.0
    elif candidate in about_to_be_free:
      wait_penalty = candidate.estimated_completion_time / 10
      score -= wait_penalty
    
    # SLA consideration
    estimated_handling_time = candidate.avg_handling_time(ticket.category)
    sla_buffer = ticket.sla_remaining_time - estimated_handling_time
    if sla_buffer < 15: # Tight SLA
      if candidate.current_workload.active_tickets > 2:
        score -= 3.0 # Avoid assigning SLA-critical to busy agent
    
    # Forecast impact (look-ahead optimization)
    # What happens to queue if we assign this ticket to this agent?
    forecast_score = forecast_queue_impact(candidate, ticket)
    score += forecast_score * 0.3
    
    IF score > best_score:
      best_score = score
      best_agent = candidate
  
  RETURN best_agent


FUNCTION forecast_queue_impact(agent, ticket):
  # Simplified version of look-ahead logic
  
  # How many tickets in queue need this agent's skills?
  skill_demand = count_tickets_requiring_skills(queue, agent.skills)
  
  # If agent has rare skill and many tickets need it, assigning this ticket is costly
  if skill_demand > 5:
    return -1.5
  
  # If agent has common skill and others can handle remaining queue, it's fine
  other_agents_available = count_agents_with_skill(agent.skills) - 1
  if other_agents_available > 3:
    return 1.0
  
  return 0
```

**D. Dynamic Resource Rebalancing**

```
CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION PROCESS (runs every 5 minutes):

CHECK for rebalancing opportunities:

1. IDENTIFY overload situations:
   FOR each agent:
     IF utilization > 0.85 AND queue_has_tickets_for_their_skills:
       FLAG overloaded
   
2. IDENTIFY underutilization:
   FOR each agent:
     IF utilization < 0.50 AND no_tickets_in_queue_for_30_min:
       FLAG underutilized

3. CONSIDER cross-training opportunities:
   IF skill_X has high queue AND skill_Y has low queue:
     IF agents_with_skill_Y can handle skill_X tickets:
       TEMPORARILY route skill_X tickets to those agents
       LOG this for training needs analysis

4. TRIGGER escalation fast-path:
   IF L2 queue length > threshold AND L3 has capacity:
     ALLOW L3 to pull tickets from L2 queue
     
5. SEND alerts:
   IF forecasted queue time > SLA for P1/P2:
     ALERT supervisor to consider:
       - Pulling agent from training/meeting
       - Asking off-duty agent to log in
       - Temporarily pausing non-urgent work

6. LOAD BALANCING:
   IF new tickets can be routed to multiple equivalent agents:
     PREFER agent with lower current workload
     IMPLEMENT "soft cap": Don't assign to agent if >4 active tickets
     unless all alternatives also at cap
```

**E. Shift Planning Optimization**

```
USE historical demand patterns to optimize schedules:

ANALYZE from process mining data:
- Ticket arrival rate by hour of day, day of week
- Required skills distribution by time period
- Seasonal patterns (month-end, specific business cycles)

GENERATE recommendations:
"Peak Network ticket demand: Monday 2-4 PM (avg 23 tickets)
Currently scheduled: 2 agents with Networking skills
Recommendation: Schedule 3-4 agents with networking skills during this period"

IMPLEMENT flexible scheduling:
- Core hours: All agents (9 AM - 3 PM)
- Rotating coverage: Early shift (7 AM - 3 PM), Late shift (11 AM - 7 PM)
- Specialist availability aligned to demand patterns for their skills
```

**Data Required:**

1. **Real-time data streams**:
   - Agent current state (working/available/break)
   - Active tickets per agent with estimated completion times
   - Queue state (tickets waiting, priorities, skill requirements)
   - System events (ticket creation, assignment, completion)

2. **Historical data for forecasting**:
   - Handling time distributions by agent-category-complexity
   - Demand patterns (ticket arrival rates) by time/day/skill
   - Agent performance metrics by workload level
   - SLA parameters and breach patterns

3. **Agent configuration data**:
   - Skills, proficiency levels
   - Maximum concurrent ticket capacity (individually calibrated)
   - Shift schedules, break times
   - Current location/availability

4. **Simulation parameters**:
   - Queue behavior models
   - Performance degradation curves (impact of workload on speed/quality)

**Expected Benefits:**

**Quantified Projections:**

1. **Reduce average queue time**:
   - Currently: 18 minutes average (47 min for some skills)
   - Target: 8 minutes average, <20 min for any skill
   - Mechanism: Optimal matching, workload awareness, look-ahead optimization

2. **Improve workload distribution**:
   - Currently: Standard deviation of utilization = 28%
   - Target: Standard deviation = 12%
   - Impact: Eliminate "burned out" agents, reduce idle time

3. **Increase effective capacity**:
   - By reducing idle time from 40% to 25% for underutilized agents
   - By preventing overload (>4 tickets) that reduces efficiency by 73%
   - Expected: 15-20% increase in throughput without adding staff

4. **Improve SLA compliance**:
   - Currently: SLA breaches often due to queue time (56% of P2 breaches)
   - Target: Reduce queue-related breaches by 70%
   - Overall SLA compliance improvement: +18 percentage points

5. **Reduce agent stress/burnout**:
   - Prevent consistent overload situations
   - Better distribute challenging tickets
   - Expected: Improve agent satisfaction scores, reduce turnover

6. **Cost avoidance**:
   - Current inefficiency effectively wastes ~2.5 FTE worth of capacity
   - Optimization could avoid need to hire additional staff despite volume growth
   - Estimated savings: $200K-300K annually

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1 Business Process Simulation for Pre-Implementation Validation

**Purpose:** Validate proposed strategies, quantify expected improvements, identify risks, and optimize parameters before costly real-world deployment.

**Simulation Approach:**

**A. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Model Development**

**Step 1: Build Baseline "As-Is" Model**

```
SIMULATION COMPONENTS:

1. ARRIVAL PROCESS:
   - Source: Process mining analysis of ticket creation patterns
   - Model: Non-homogeneous Poisson process
   - Parameters extracted from event log:
     * (t) = arrival rate by hour of day, day of week
     * Distributions: Priority (P1: 8%, P2: 23%, P3: 52%, P4: 17%)
     * Category distributions
     * Channel distributions
   
   Example parameterization:
   Monday 10 AM:  = 12 tickets/hour
   - Software-App: 35%, Network: 25%, Hardware: 20%, Security: 10%, Access: 10%
   - P1/P2/P3/P4: 8%/23%/52%/17%

2. TICKET CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Category, Priority, Required Skill
   - Complexity score (if using Strategy 2)
   - Sampled from empirical distributions in event log

3. RESOURCES (AGENTS):
   - Number per tier: L1=15, L2=10, L3=5
   - Skills per agent (from actual profiles)
   - Capacity: Max concurrent tickets (derived from performance analysis)
   - Availability schedule: Shifts, breaks (from actual schedules)
   - Performance characteristics:
     * Handling time distributions by agent, category, complexity
     * Extracted from event log: TIMESTAMP_DIFF('Work End', 'Work Start')
     * Fitted distributions (e.g., log-normal, Weibull)

4. ASSIGNMENT LOGIC:
   - Current: Round-robin within tier, manual escalation
   - Modeled from observed patterns in event log
   
5. PROCESS FLOW:
   - Activities: Create  Queue  Assign  Work  {Resolve | Escalate | Reassign}
   - Branching probabilities from process mining variant analysis
   - Example: After L1 Work: 61% Resolve, 39% Escalate

6. PERFORMANCE MEASURES:
   - Queue time, handling time, resolution time
   - SLA compliance (compare to target times)
   - Resource utilization
   - Reassignment frequency
```

**Step 2: Validate Baseline Model**

```
VALIDATION CHECKS:

1. Statistical comparison: Simulated vs. actual event log
   - Average resolution time per category (t-test, p>0.05 for validity)
   - Queue time distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
   - SLA compliance rates (² test)
   - Utilization rates per agent

2. Visual comparison:
   - Process mining discovers actual paths & frequencies
   - Simulation generates paths & frequencies
   - Compare: Should show same variant patterns

3. Sensitivity analysis:
   - Run multiple replications (30+ runs)
   - Check output stability (coefficient of variation <10%)
   
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Simulated metrics within ±5% of actual for key KPIs
- Distribution shapes match (visual inspection + statistical tests)
- Captures process variability (same std dev patterns)
```

**Step 3: Implement "To-Be" Scenarios**

Create three separate simulation models, one for each strategy:

**Scenario 1: Skill-Based Routing**
```
CHANGES TO BASELINE MODEL:

Assignment Logic Module:
  REPLACE round-robin WITH skill_matching_algorithm():
    - Filter agents by required skill
    - Score by proficiency level
    - Consider workload (weighted scoring)
    - Assign to top-scored agent
  
  ADD cross-tier flexibility:
    - L1 experts can handle some L2 tickets
    - Threshold: L2 queue > 5 AND ticket complexity < 7
  
  ADJUST escalation logic:
    - Reduce escalation probability based on skill match quality
    - Estimated impact from root cause analysis:
      * Perfect skill match: Escalation probability -45%
      * Partial match: -20%
      * No match: +30%
  
  ADD reassignment reduction:
    - Reassignment probability reduced from 23% to 9%
    - Applied when skill_match_score > threshold
```

**Scenario 2: Predictive Complexity-Based Routing**
```
CHANGES TO BASELINE MODEL:

Ticket Generation Module:
  ADD complexity_score assignment (1-10):
    - Sample from fitted distribution based on category
    - Example: Software-App complexity ~ Normal(=5.2, =2.1)
  
Assignment Logic Module:
  IMPLEMENT complexity_routing():
    IF complexity  3: Route to L1
    IF complexity 4-6: Route to experienced L1 OR L2 (based on priority)
    IF complexity  7: Route directly to L2/L3
  
  ADJUST handling times:
    - Complex tickets routed to L2 directly: -30% handling time
      (avoids L1 preliminary work that doesn't help)
    - L1 agents with decision support: -15% handling time on moderate tickets
  
  ADJUST escalation rates:
    - L1 receives fewer complex tickets: Overall L1 escalation -40%
    - L2 receives pre-qualified complex: Reassignment -50%
```

**Scenario 3: Dynamic Workload-Aware Assignment**
```
CHANGES TO BASELINE MODEL:

Resource Module:
  ADD real-time workload tracking:
    - Each agent has current_active_tickets counter
    - Remaining_time_estimate for each active ticket
  
Assignment Logic Module:
  IMPLEMENT workload_aware_assignment():
    - Calculate availability scores for all agents with skill
    - Penalize heavily loaded agents (>4 tickets: score *= 0.3)
    - Consider "about to be free" agents (completion in <10 min)
    - Implement look-ahead: Avoid assigning rare skills to common tasks
  
  ADD priority queue management:
    - Tickets not FIFO, but sorted by dynamic priority score
    - High-priority tickets can jump queue
  
  ADJUST performance by workload:
    - Handling time increases with concurrent tickets:
      * 1-2 tickets: baseline time
      * 3-4 tickets: +30% time
      * 5+ tickets: +73% time
      * Implemented as: time = baseline * (1 + 0.18 * (active_tickets - 2))
  
  ADD rebalancing logic:
    - Every 30 simulation minutes, check for rebalancing opportunities
    - If queue > threshold and underutilized agents exist:
      * Temporarily route tickets to adjacent skill agents
```

**Step 4: Run Comparative Simulations**

```
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:

Run each scenario (baseline + 3 strategies):
- Simulation period: 3 months (to capture variability)
- Warm-up period: 2 weeks (discard initial transient state)
- Replications: 50 runs with different random seeds
- Output: 95% confidence intervals for all KPIs

SCENARIOS TO TEST:

1. Normal load (baseline arrival rates)
2. Peak load (+30% arrival rate)
3. Skill shortage (remove 2 agents with Networking-Firewall skill)
4. Priority shift (increase P1/P2 proportion by 50%)
5. Combination (peak load + priority shift)

For each scenario × strategy combination:
  Record: All KPIs (resolution time, SLA%, reassignments, utilization, queue times)
```

**B. Simulation Output Analysis**

**Key Performance Indicators to Compare:**

```
KPI DASHBOARD:

1. RESOLUTION TIME:
   - Average total resolution time (by priority, category)
   - 95th percentile resolution time
   - Reduction vs. baseline

2. SLA COMPLIANCE:
   - % tickets meeting SLA (overall, by priority)
   - Expected improvement in percentage points
   - Time-based view: How quickly does backlog clear?

3. RESOURCE EFFICIENCY:
   - Agent utilization (mean, std dev showing balance)
   - Idle time percentage
   - Productive time (excluding reassignment waste)

4. PROCESS QUALITY:
   - Reassignment rate
   - Escalation rate
   - First-time-right rate
   - Queue time (average, 95th percentile)

5. THROUGHPUT:
   - Tickets resolved per day
   - Capacity headroom (max load sustainable)

6. WORKLOAD DISTRIBUTION:
   - Standard deviation of tickets handled per agent
   - Max/min workload ratio
   - Gini coefficient (inequality measure)

7. COST PROXIES:
   - Total agent-hours consumed
   - Overtime required (if utilization >100%)
   - Customer wait time costs
```

**Example Simulation Results Summary:**

| KPI | Baseline | Strategy 1 (Skill-Based) | Strategy 2 (Predictive) | Strategy 3 (Workload-Aware) | Combined |
|-----|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Avg Resolution Time (hrs) | 3.7 | 2.9 (-22%) | 3.1 (-16%) | 2.8 (-24%) | 2.3 (-38%) |
| SLA Compliance (%) | 78% | 86% (+8pp) | 84% (+6pp) | 89% (+11pp) | 92% (+14pp) |
| Reassignment Rate (%) | 23% | 9% (-61%) | 11% (-52%) | 14% (-39%) | 7% (-70%) |
| L1 Escalation Rate (%) | 39% | 35% (-10%) | 27% (-31%) | 37% (-5%) | 24% (-38%) |
| Avg Queue Time (min) | 18 | 14 (-22%) | 16 (-11%) | 9 (-50%) | 8 (-56%) |
| Agent Utilization Mean | 68% | 71% | 70% | 74% | 76% |
| Agent Utilization StdDev | 28% | 22% | 24% | 12% | 11% |
| Tickets/Day Throughput | 387 | 428 (+11%) | 415 (+7%) | 442 (+14%) | 465 (+20%) |

**Interpretation:**
- All strategies show improvement, but magnitudes vary
- Strategy 3 (workload-aware) has strongest impact on queue time and utilization balance
- Strategy 1 (skill-based) most effective at reducing reassignments
- Strategy 2 (predictive) most effective at reducing unnecessary L1 escalations
- **Combined approach** (all three strategies together) yields best results
- **Recommendation**: Implement all three in integrated fashion

**C. Sensitivity Analysis and What-If Scenarios**

**Test Strategy Robustness:**

```
SENSITIVITY TESTS:

1. PARAMETER VARIATIONS:
   Test impact of algorithm parameters:
   - Skill matching: Vary weight of proficiency vs. workload (Strategy 1)
   - Complexity threshold: Vary direct-to-L2 threshold (Strategy 2)
   - Workload cap: Vary max concurrent tickets before severe penalty (Strategy 3)
   
   Goal: Find optimal parameter settings
   Method: Response surface methodology, factorial design

2. DEMAND VARIATIONS:
   - Volume increase: +10%, +20%, +30% ticket arrival
   - Priority shift: More P1/P2 (crisis scenario)
   - Category shift: Seasonal patterns (e.g., more Security tickets during audit season)
   
   Goal: Ensure strategies remain effective under different conditions

3. RESOURCE VARIATIONS:
   - Agent attrition: Remove 1-3 agents from each tier
   - Skill gaps: Remove agents with specific skills
   - Training scenarios: Add skills to existing agents
   
   Goal: Identify fragility points, guide hiring/training decisions

4. PROCESS VARIATIONS:
   - New ticket types: Introduce novel categories
   - SLA changes: More stringent SLAs
   - Policy changes: e.g., All P1 must go to L3
   
   Goal: Test adaptability of strategies

EXAMPLE FINDING:
"Strategy 3 (workload-aware) maintains benefits even with +30% volume increase,
while baseline system experiences SLA compliance collapse (78%  54%).
However, Strategy 1 (skill-based) performance degrades if >2 networking specialists unavailable.
Recommendation: Implement cross-training program for networking skills."
```

**D. Simulation-Based Optimization**

Use simulation as objective function evaluator:

```
OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM:

Maximize: SLA_Compliance
Subject to: 
  - Agent_Utilization < 85% (avoid burnout)
  - Cost_Constraint (staffing budget)
  
Decision Variables:
  - Number of agents per tier
  - Skill distribution (which agents to train in which skills)
  - Shift schedules
  - Assignment algorithm parameters

METHOD:
1. Simulation-optimization using:
   - Genetic algorithms
   - Simulated annealing
   - OptQuest or similar
   
2. Each candidate solution evaluated via simulation:
   - Run 10 replications
   - Average SLA compliance = fitness score
   
3. Iterate until convergence

OUTPUT:
"Optimal configuration:
- L1: 16 agents (+1), L2: 11 agents (+1), L3: 5 agents (same)
- Train 3 L1 agents in App-CRM skill
- Train 2 L2 agents in Networking-Firewall skill
- Shift 2 agents from morning to afternoon shift (peak coverage)
- Strategy 3 workload cap parameter: 4.2 concurrent tickets (optimal vs. 4 or 5)

Expected outcome: 93.5% SLA compliance within budget constraint"
```

```

**GATE 1: Pilot Preparation (Month 1)**

```
Activities:
1. Select pilot scope:
   - Strategy choice: Start with Strategy 1 (Skill-based) as foundation
   - Tier: L2 only (smaller, more controlled, specialists easier to engage)
   - Categories: Software-App and Network (high volume, high impact)
   - Duration: 4 weeks

2. Build pilot environment:
   - Parallel system: Algorithm runs alongside current process
   - Shadow mode: Generate recommendations but don't execute
   - Comparison framework: Track what algorithm recommends vs. what actually happens

3. Training:
   - Supervisors: How algorithm works, how to use dashboard, override procedures
   - Agents: What changes, what stays same, FAQ
   - Dispatchers: New workflow, system interface

4. Communication:
   - All-hands meeting: Explain goals, process, expectations
   - Q&A sessions
