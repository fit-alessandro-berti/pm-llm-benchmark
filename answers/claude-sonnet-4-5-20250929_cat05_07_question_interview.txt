# Clarifying Questions for Property Onboarding Process

## Initial Documentation & Verification

1. What specifically triggers the documentation review to be considered "complete"? Is there a checklist or approval step?

2. When documents are found to be missing or outdated, what is the typical turnaround time you expect from landlords, and what happens if they don't respond within that timeframe?

3. Are there any types of properties or situations where you would reject a landlord's request entirely, rather than just requesting updated documentation?

4. Who has the authority to approve moving forward after the documentation phase—is it solely the property coordinator, or does it require sign-off from someone else?

## Property Manager Assignment

5. You mentioned several factors for assigning a property manager (workload, geography, experience, track record). How are these factors weighted against each other when making the assignment? Is there a formal scoring system, or is it more judgment-based?

6. What happens if no property manager is available who meets all the ideal criteria? How do you handle that situation?

7. Is the property manager assignment ever changed after the initial assignment? Under what circumstances would you reassign a property?

8. Who actually makes the assignment decision—is it the property coordinator, a manager of property managers, or someone else?

## Landlord Alignment Meeting

9. What are the typical outcomes of the landlord-property manager meeting? Are there scenarios where this meeting results in the company deciding not to proceed with the property?

10. How are the special conditions and policies discussed in this meeting formally documented and tracked throughout the rest of the process?

11. Is the landlord required to commit to any specific terms or agreements during this meeting, or is it purely informational at this stage?

## Inspection & Photography

12. Does the photography and inspection happen simultaneously, or is there a specific sequence? What determines the timing?

13. When the inspector finds issues, how do you decide which issues are deal-breakers versus which ones can be addressed through repairs? Who makes that determination?

14. Is there a deadline or timeline for landlords to complete required repairs? What happens if repairs take longer than expected or the landlord refuses to make them?

15. Does the property need to pass a re-inspection after repairs are completed, or is the contractor's confirmation sufficient?

16. Who pays for the photography, inspection, and any required repairs—the landlord or the management company?

## Marketing & Pricing

17. What is the digital marketing team's turnaround time, and does the process ever wait on them, or do they work in parallel with other steps?

18. How are pricing models and market trends incorporated? Is this a manual review by an analyst, or is there an automated system? At what point is the final rental price locked in?

19. Can the landlord override or negotiate the recommended rental price? What happens if there's disagreement?

## Tenant Screening & Selection

20. What are your specific criteria for accepting or rejecting a tenant application? Are these standardized across all properties, or do they vary by property or landlord preference?

21. When multiple qualified tenants apply, who has the final decision on which tenant to select—the property manager, the landlord, or someone else?

22. You mentioned negotiating lease terms and promotional discounts—who has the authority to approve these variations from standard terms?

23. How long does the tenant screening process typically take? Is there a risk of losing good tenants if the process takes too long?

24. What happens if no suitable tenant is found after a certain period? Is there a process to revisit pricing or marketing strategies?

## Lease Finalization

25. Is there a standard lease template, or is each lease customized? How are the "custom lease clauses" that some landlords insist on reviewed and approved?

26. Who is involved in the actual lease signing—just the tenant and property manager, or are there other parties present or required to sign off?

27. At what point does the security deposit get transferred or held? Is it held by your company or in a separate account?

## Quality Checks & Compliance

28. When do the compliance officer and financial analyst reviews happen—before the tenant is selected, before the lease is signed, or after? Can they halt the process if they find issues?

29. What are the most common compliance or pricing issues that get flagged during these reviews?

30. You mentioned IT checks on data integration—what happens if there are errors discovered? How are they corrected, and does this ever delay the move-in date?

## Timeline & Sequencing

31. From start to finish, what is the typical duration of this entire onboarding process under normal circumstances?

32. Which steps happen in parallel versus sequentially? For example, can marketing begin before the inspection is complete?

33. Are there any bottlenecks or steps that frequently cause delays in the process?

## Exception Handling & Edge Cases

34. You mentioned properties requiring special insurance—at what point is this identified, and how does it affect the timeline or process flow?

35. What other types of exceptions or special cases do you encounter regularly that weren't covered in your description?

36. When there are back-and-forth communications between multiple parties, how do you ensure nothing falls through the cracks? Is there an escalation process for stalled situations?

37. Are there different process variations based on property type (residential vs. commercial, single-family vs. multi-unit, furnished vs. unfurnished)?

## Roles & Communication

38. You mentioned using email, CRM, and project management tools—how do stakeholders know where to look for the latest information? Is there one system of record?

39. How frequently do the regional offices, property managers, and support teams communicate during an active onboarding? Are there scheduled checkpoints?

40. If the original property coordinator moves to a different role mid-process, how is the handoff managed?

## Success Criteria & Metrics

41. How do you measure whether a property onboarding was successful? Are there quality metrics or KPIs you track?

42. At what point is the property officially considered "onboarded" and this process complete—when the tenant moves in, when the first rent payment is received, or some other milestone?
