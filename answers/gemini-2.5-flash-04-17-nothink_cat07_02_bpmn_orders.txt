The image provided is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating a business process across four pools: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

Here's a breakdown of the visualization:

**Overall Structure:**

* The diagram is organized vertically into four distinct pools, representing different departments or roles within a business: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.
* Each pool contains a sequence of activities (tasks) and events connected by sequence flows (solid lines).
* Message flows (dashed lines) indicate communication and data exchange between different pools.

**Sales Pool:**

* The process begins with a timer event labeled "Monday morning".
* The first task is "Check order for completeness".
* This is followed by an exclusive gateway that checks "if customer is already in the database".
* If the customer is "Customer not in the database", a task "Add customer to the database" is performed, which involves interacting with a data store icon labeled "database".
* Both branches converge into another exclusive gateway.
* The process then proceeds to "Send order details", indicated by a send task (envelope icon).
* After sending order details, there's a receive task (envelope icon) labeled "Product sent".
* Finally, the process ends with "Draft invoice" and an end event.

**Production Pool:**

* The process in the Production pool starts with a message start event labeled "Order details arrive".
* This is followed by a parallel gateway.
* One path from the parallel gateway leads to the task "Plan production".
* The other path leads to a message catch event labeled "Material not faulty".
* Both paths converge into another parallel gateway.
* The process then moves to the task "Manufacture product".
* After manufacturing, there's a send task labeled "Product complete" (envelope icon) indicating sending a message.

**Procurement Pool:**

* The Procurement process begins with a message start event labeled "Order details arrive".
* This pool contains a collapsed subprocess labeled "Material Compensation Subprocess".
* Inside the subprocess, the first task is "Order materials", which is a manual task (hand icon).
* This leads to an exclusive gateway.
* One path from the gateway goes to a task labeled "Return material", which is a manual task. This path then returns to the initial exclusive gateway within the subprocess.
* The other path from the exclusive gateway within the subprocess leads to a task labeled "Check materials", indicated by a service task (gear icon).
* After checking materials, there's a parallel gateway.
* One path from the parallel gateway leads to a receive task labeled "Order cancellation" (envelope icon).
* The other path from the parallel gateway leads to a parallel gateway and then to an end event.

**Warehouse Pool:**

* The Warehouse process begins with a message start event labeled "Product complete".
* This is followed by the task "Send product", indicated by a send task (envelope icon).
* The process concludes with a message end event labeled "Product sent".

**Message Flows:**

* There are several dashed message flows indicating communication between the pools:
    * From "Send order details" (Sales) to "Order details arrive" (Production and Procurement).
    * From "Product complete" (Production) to "Product complete" (Warehouse).
    * From "Send product" (Warehouse) to "Product sent" (Sales).

**Overall Flow:**

The BPMN diagram depicts a process that starts in Sales with checking and processing customer orders. Based on the customer's status, the process either proceeds directly or involves adding the customer to the database. Order details are then sent to both Production and Procurement. Production plans and manufactures the product, potentially waiting for confirmation of material quality from Procurement. Procurement handles material ordering and checking, with a sub-process for material compensation including options for returning faulty material. Once the product is complete, the message is sent to the Warehouse. The Warehouse then sends the product, and a message is sent back to Sales indicating the product has been sent, allowing Sales to draft the invoice. There are also indications of potential order cancellation events in Procurement.
