**Analyzing anomalies in P2P process cases**

I'll review each case's sequence of procurement steps, spotlighting out-of-order actions like payment before approval or invoice, goods receipt before PO, and late approvals, then explain why these violate controls and pose compliance or fraud risks.

### Overview of the “As-Is” Sequence
A standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process generally follows this order:  
1. **Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  Receive Goods/Services  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO/Receipt (three-way match)  Release Payment  Close Case.**

Any material deviation from this order can signal internal-control breaches, compliance issues, or operational risk. Below are the anomalies spotted in the provided event log together with an explanation of why they are problematic.

### Case-by-Case Anomalies

#### Case 1002
- **Issue Purchase Order before requisition approval** (`Issue PO` 08:40 preceding `Approve PR` on 2024-02-03 08:00).  
  *Why it’s a problem:* PO should only be issued after authorization. Skipping approval sidesteps spend controls and could lead to unapproved commitments.

- **Payment released before approval, goods receipt, and three-way match** (`Release Payment` 2024-02-03 07:15 happens before `Approve PR`, `Receive Goods`, and `Match Invoice to PO`).  
  *Why it’s a problem:* Paying a vendor before verification exposes the company to overpayment, fraud, or payment for goods never received.

- **Approval comes after payment** (`Approve PR` occurs after `Release Payment`).  
  *Why it’s a problem:* Retroactive approval defeats its purpose as a preventive control—it becomes mere documentation rather than true authorization.

#### Case 1003
- **Payment released before invoice receipt and goods receipt** (`Release Payment` 2024-02-08, but `Vendor Invoice Received` 2024-02-09 and `Receive Goods` 2024-02-10).  
  *Why it’s a problem:* Payment typically requires an invoice plus confirmation that goods/services were delivered. Paying beforehand is an unsecured advance and poses high risk.

- **Three-way match performed after payment** (`Match Invoice to PO` 2024-02-11, post-payment).  
  *Why it’s a problem:* The three-way match is a key control to prevent discrepancies. Performing it after payment negates its preventive value.

#### Case 1004
- **Goods received before purchase order is issued** (`Receive Goods` 2024-02-06 09:00, but `Issue PO` at 09:15 same day).  
  *Why it’s a problem:* Goods should not be delivered before the buyer issues a formal PO. Receiving first suggests the purchase bypassed formal ordering channels, which can create contractual disputes and indicates weak procurement controls.

### Summary
- **Case 1001** follows the standard P2P flow—no anomaly.
- **Case 1002** shows multiple control breaches: PO issued without approval, payment before approval/goods receipt/matching, retroactive approval.
- **Case 1003** reveals premature payment—before invoice, receipt, and matching.
- **Case 1004** records goods receipt preceding the PO, signaling the order wasn’t properly authorized before delivery.

Each of these deviations can undermine financial control, create compliance risks, and make the organization vulnerable to fraud or procurement errors.
