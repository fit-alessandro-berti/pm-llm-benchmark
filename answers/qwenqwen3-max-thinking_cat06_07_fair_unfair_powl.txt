Below are two **POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language)** models that reflect the hiring process at **GlobalTeq Solutions**, as described in your scenario. Both models use the same core structure—application intake, data completeness loop, skill assessment, cultural evaluation, managerial review, and final decision—but differ in how they handle the **cultural fit and community affiliation** step to either **introduce** or **eliminate** potential unfairness.

We use the following activity labels based on your description:
- `ReceiveApplication`
- `DataCompletenessCheck`
- `RequestMoreInfo` (used in the loop)
- `SkillAssessment`
- `CulturalFitCheck` (standard, unbiased evaluation)
- `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (biased path that gives advantage)
- `ManagerialReview`
- `FinalDecision`

We also use:
- **XOR operator** for branching choices
- **LOOP operator** for the data completeness check
- **StrictPartialOrder** to define sequencing

### **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

In this model, after the `SkillAssessment`, there is an **XOR split**:  
- One branch leads to a standard `CulturalFitCheck`  
- The other leads to a `CommunityAffiliationCheck`, which implicitly boosts certain applicants  

This creates a **biased path** that depends on optional applicant-provided data (e.g., club membership or local residency).

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define atomic activities
receive = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness: DataCompletenessCheck -> (RequestMoreInfo -> DataCompletenessCheck)*
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# XOR branch after skill assessment
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_check])

# Build the main sequence using StrictPartialOrder
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive,
    data_loop,
    skill_assess,
    cultural_xor,
    manager_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define execution order
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, manager_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

> **Where unfairness arises**: The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` path gives an implicit advantage to applicants with certain affiliations (e.g., “Global Business Leaders Club” or local residency). Because this is an **XOR choice** based on optional self-reported data, it introduces **non-merit-based differentiation**, violating fairness.

---

### **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**

In this revised model, **all applicants undergo the same `CulturalFitCheck`**. There is **no XOR branch** based on community affiliation. The process remains meritocratic and consistent across candidates.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define atomic activities (same as above, but no CommunityAffiliationCheck)
receive = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Only one cultural evaluation
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# No XOR — all applicants follow the same path
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive,
    data_loop,
    skill_assess,
    cultural_fit,
    manager_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define execution order
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

> **Why this is fair**: Every applicant, regardless of background or affiliations, undergoes **identical evaluation steps**. The cultural fit assessment is **standardized and uniform**, removing the opportunity for implicit bias based on optional demographic or community cues.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature | Unfair Model | Fair Model |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Cultural Evaluation | XOR between `CulturalFitCheck` and `CommunityAffiliationCheck` | Only `CulturalFitCheck` |
| Bias Risk | High (affiliation-based advantage) | None (uniform process) |
| Control Flow | Includes biased choice point | Linear, consistent path |
| Compliance with Fair Hiring |  |  |

These POWL models can be used in process mining or compliance verification tools (e.g., in `pm4py`) to detect or eliminate structural sources of algorithmic or procedural bias in hiring workflows.
