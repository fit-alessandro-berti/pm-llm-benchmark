**Justification of Naming Changes:**

* **Initiate Request:** Renamed to reflect the *how* of the request submission (online, in-person).  Became "Submit Request Online," "Submit Request In-Person."
* **Verify Documents:**  The context surrounding this activity changes significantly. The initial verification is distinct from verifying additional documents or re-verifying after adjustments. The Resource and Additional Context columns provided crucial clues. This activity was renamed to "Initial Document Verification", "Verify Additional Documents", "Physical ID Verification", and "Verify Adjusted Documents".
* **Call Customer:**  The *reason* for calling is critical. We see calls for missing documents, clarification calls, confirmation calls, and calls to recall a customer.  Renaming highlights these distinctions. This activity was renamed to "Call for Missing Documents", "Clarification Call", "Confirmation Call", and "Customer Recall Call".



By renaming these activities, the revised event log becomes much more informative and easier to analyze.  The revised activity names now clearly distinguish different instances of the same original activity name and capture the specific context of each occurrence. This granular detail is essential for process mining, optimization, and understanding customer journeys.
