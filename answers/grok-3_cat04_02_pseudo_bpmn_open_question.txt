### **2. Redesigned Process with Detailed Changes**

#### **Start Event --> Task A: "Receive Customer Request" (Enhanced with Automation)**
- **Change**: Implement an AI-powered chatbot or automated form submission system integrated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to categorize incoming requests based on keywords, historical data, and customer profiles. This system will tag requests as "likely standard" or "likely custom" even before human intervention.
- **New Subprocess**: Add a "Pre-Classification Engine" that uses predictive analytics to score the likelihood of a request being custom based on past data (e.g., customer history, product type, or request complexity).
- **Impact**: Reduces manual effort in initial classification, speeds up routing, and sets the stage for proactive handling of custom requests.

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type" (Enhanced with Predictive Routing)**
- **Change**: Replace the manual or rule-based decision with a dynamic decision gateway powered by the Pre-Classification Engine's output. If the likelihood of a custom request is above a threshold (e.g., 80%), route it directly to the custom path with a preliminary feasibility check running in parallel.
- **New Gateway Output**: Add a third path for "Uncertain Classification" (e.g., 40-80% likelihood of customization), which triggers a lightweight human review or additional data collection (e.g., customer clarification) before final routing.
- **Impact**: Reduces misclassification errors and ensures edge cases are handled efficiently without delaying the process.

#### **Standard Path: Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation" (Automated)**
- **Change**: Automate validation using rule-based systems or machine learning models trained on historical validation outcomes. For example, integrate APIs to verify customer data or order specifications against internal databases in real-time.
- **Impact**: Cuts down validation time from hours to minutes, freeing up human resources for more complex tasks.

#### **Standard Path: Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks" (Optimized Resource Allocation)**
- **Change**: Dynamically allocate resources for "Credit Check" (Task C1) and "Inventory Check" (Task C2) based on current workload and system availability. For instance, use a resource management system to prioritize urgent requests or route checks to underutilized servers/teams.
- **New Subprocess**: Introduce a "Predictive Bottleneck Alert" system that flags potential delays in either check (e.g., inventory shortages or credit approval backlogs) and triggers contingency actions like expedited processing or alternative inventory sourcing.
- **Impact**: Ensures parallel tasks are completed faster by balancing workloads, reducing idle time, and proactively addressing delays.

#### **Standard Path: Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date" (Enhanced with Predictive Analytics)**
- **Change**: Use predictive analytics to estimate delivery dates based on historical data, current supply chain conditions, and real-time logistics updates. Integrate with external systems (e.g., weather data, shipping provider APIs) to refine predictions.
- **Impact**: Provides more accurate delivery estimates, improving customer trust and enabling better planning.

#### **Custom Path: Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis" (Partially Automated)**
- **Change**: Automate the initial feasibility analysis using AI models trained on past custom requests to identify common patterns (e.g., material availability, production constraints). Human experts are involved only for high-complexity or low-confidence AI predictions.
- **New Subprocess**: Add a "Resource Matching Engine" to dynamically allocate specialized designers or engineers to custom requests based on expertise and availability, reducing wait times for expert input.
- **Impact**: Speeds up the feasibility analysis for straightforward custom requests and ensures complex cases are handled by the right experts, improving outcomes.

#### **Custom Path: Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?" (Enhanced Decision Support)**
- **Change**: Provide decision support to human reviewers (if involved) by displaying AI-generated feasibility scores, risk factors, and alternative solutions (e.g., partial customization).
- **Impact**: Reduces decision-making time and improves the quality of decisions for custom requests.

#### **Custom Path: Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation" (Automated First Draft)**
- **Change**: Automate the creation of a first draft quotation using templates and historical pricing data, with human review for final adjustments.
- **Impact**: Speeds up quotation delivery, allowing faster customer feedback and iteration.

#### **Custom Path: Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice" (Enhanced Communication)**
- **Change**: Automate rejection notices with personalized explanations and alternative suggestions (e.g., standard products that meet similar needs), generated by the AI system.
- **Impact**: Maintains customer satisfaction even in rejection scenarios by offering actionable alternatives.

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?" (Streamlined with Risk Scoring)**
- **Change**: Replace the static approval rule with a risk-scoring model that evaluates factors like order value, customer history, and deviation from standard processes to determine if approval is needed. Low-risk orders bypass approval entirely.
- **Impact**: Reduces unnecessary delays for low-risk orders while ensuring high-risk cases are flagged for review.

#### **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval" (Digital Workflow)**
- **Change**: Implement a digital approval workflow with automated notifications, reminders, and mobile app integration for managers to approve or reject requests on the go.
- **Impact**: Cuts approval times significantly by removing manual follow-ups and enabling remote decision-making.

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?" & Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions" (Iterative Feedback Loop)**
- **Change**: Enhance the feedback loop by providing structured reasons for rejection and actionable recommendations for re-evaluation (e.g., adjust pricing, modify specifications). Use AI to suggest optimal adjustments based on past successful re-evaluations.
- **Impact**: Reduces iteration cycles by guiding the re-evaluation process with data-driven insights.

#### **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice" (Fully Automated)**
- **Change**: Automate invoice generation using pre-defined templates and real-time data from previous tasks (e.g., delivery date, pricing).
- **Impact**: Eliminates manual errors and speeds up the finalization process.

#### **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer" (Personalized Communication)**
- **Change**: Use automated, personalized email or SMS confirmations with dynamic content (e.g., delivery timelines, contact points for queries) based on customer preferences and request type.
- **Impact**: Enhances customer experience through timely and relevant communication.

#### **New Subprocess: "Continuous Monitoring & Feedback Loop" (Post-Process)**
- **Addition**: Introduce a post-process monitoring system to track customer satisfaction (via surveys), process performance metrics (e.g., turnaround time, approval rates), and predictive model accuracy. Feed this data back into the Pre-Classification Engine and other AI systems for continuous improvement.
- **Impact**: Ensures the process evolves over time, adapting to changing customer needs and operational challenges.
