The visualization appears to depict a flowchart outlining a business process, likely related to order management, production, and fulfillment. It can be broken down into several key sections:

1. **Sales Process**:
   - Begins with checking customer orders for completeness.
   - If the customer is not already in the database, they are added.
   - Order details are sent, followed by drafting an invoice.

2. **Production Process**:
   - Starts with the arrival of order details.
   - Production planning occurs, followed by the manufacturing of the product.
   - There is a check to ensure that the material used is not faulty before completing the product.

3. **Procurement Process**:
   - A subprocess for material compensation is highlighted.
   - It includes ordering materials and checking their quality.
   - There is a possibility of returning materials and canceling orders if necessary.

4. **Warehouse Process**:
   - Involves sending the completed product once all earlier steps are verified.

Overall, the flowchart illustrates a systematic approach to handling customer orders, ensuring product quality, and managing material procurement before fulfilling the order through the warehouse.
