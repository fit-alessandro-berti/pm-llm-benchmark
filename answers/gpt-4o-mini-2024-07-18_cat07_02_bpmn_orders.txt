The visualization appears to be a flowchart outlining a process that includes multiple stages: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehousing. Here's a breakdown of each section:

### Sales
- **Check order for completeness:** This step verifies that the customer's order is complete.
- **Check customer's order:** There are decisions based on whether the customer is already in the database.
    - If not, the customer is added to the database.
    - If yes, it proceeds to send order details and draft an invoice.
- **Send order details and draft invoice:** Final steps in the sales process.

### Production
- **Plan production:** This stage involves planning based on the order details.
- **Manufacture product:** The product is manufactured if materials are confirmed to be not faulty.
    - If the product is complete, it moves on to the next phase.

### Procurement
- **Material Compensation Subprocess:** 
    - **Order materials:** Materials are ordered based on the production plan.
    - **Check materials:** This step verifies whether the materials meet quality standards.
        - If the materials are faulty, there's a return process.
        - If they're acceptable, the process can continue.

### Warehousing
- **Send product:** Once the product is completed, it is sent to the customer.

### Key Features
- **Decision points:** Illustrated by diamonds, showing the flow based on Yes/No questions.
- **Subprocesses:** Indicated by rectangular boxes containing specific tasks related to material management.

Overall, the flowchart defines a structured approach to handling customer orders, from sales to product delivery, including quality control in the production and procurement processes.
