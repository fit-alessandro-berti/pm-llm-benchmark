To identify the root causes of performance issues in the given process variants, we need to analyze the frequency and performance (time taken) of each variant. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **High-Frequency Variants with Good Performance:**
   - **Variant 1:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 4618, performance = 810187.903)
     - This variant is the most frequent and has a relatively good performance.
   - **Variant 3:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 1392, performance = 854633.975)
     - This variant is the third most frequent and has a slightly higher performance time but still good.
   - **Variant 4:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 575, performance = 861058.409)
     - This variant is the fourth most frequent and has a slightly higher performance time but still acceptable.

### 2. **High-Frequency Variants with Poor Performance:**
   - **Variant 2:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 2473, performance = 1084338.407)
     - This variant has a significantly higher performance time compared to Variant 1, which suggests that the additional step of approval by the BUDGET OWNER is causing delays.
   - **Variant 5:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 345, performance = 1604595.638)
     - This variant involves a rejection and resubmission cycle, which significantly increases the overall time.
   - **Variant 6:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 188, performance = 2061236.516)
     - This variant also involves a rejection and resubmission cycle with an additional approval step, leading to even longer delays.

### 3. **Low-Frequency Variants with Poor Performance:**
   - **Variant 14:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 36, performance = 2542497.917)
     - This variant involves multiple rejections and resubmissions, which significantly increases the time.
   - **Variant 15:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE ( frequency = 31, performance = 713794.452 )`
     - This variant involves a rejection and resubmission cycle but has fewer steps, leading to moderate delays.
   - **Variant 26:** `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION ( frequency = 5, performance = 13805869.200 )`
     - This variant involves a single rejection and is the least frequent but has an extremely high performance time, indicating significant issues.

### **Root Causes:**
1. **Multiple Rejection and Resubmission Cycles:**
   - Variants involving multiple rejections and resubmissions (e.g., Variants 5, 6, 14) have significantly higher performance times. Each rejection and resubmission adds to the overall processing time.
2. **Additional Approval Steps:**
   - Variants with additional approval steps (e.g., BUDGET OWNER in Variant 2) have longer performance times compared to those without these steps.
3. **Initial Rejection by Administration:**
   - Variants where the initial rejection is by the administration (e.g., Variants 5, 6, 14) tend to have higher performance times due to the need for resubmission and reapproval.
4. **Rejection by Supervisor:**
   - Variants where the supervisor rejects the declaration (e.g., Variant 15) also show higher performance times, indicating that supervisor approval is a critical bottleneck.
5. **Single Rejection without Resubmission:**
   - Variants where the process ends with a single rejection (e.g., Variant 26) have extremely high performance times, suggesting that these rejections are particularly problematic and may involve complex or unresolved issues.

### **Recommendations:**
1. **Streamline Approval Processes:**
   - Simplify the approval process by reducing the number of steps where possible.
2. **Improve Initial Submission Quality:**
   - Ensure that employees submit high-quality declarations to reduce the likelihood of rejections and resubmissions.
3. **Enhance Communication:**
   - Improve communication between administrators, budget owners, and supervisors to resolve issues more quickly.
4. **Automate Rejection Handling:**
   - Implement automated rejection handling and feedback mechanisms to speed up the resubmission process.
5. **Monitor and Address Bottlenecks:**
   - Regularly monitor the performance of each step and address any bottlenecks, especially those involving supervisor approval.

By addressing these root causes, you can significantly improve the overall performance of the process variants.
