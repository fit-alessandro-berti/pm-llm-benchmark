 Process enhancement in process mining is the practice of improving a business process by identifying and implementing potential improvements based on the insights gained from process mining analysis. It is an iterative process that involves analyzing event logs, identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or non-adherences, and then systematically applying changes to optimize the process.

Process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking in the following ways:

1. Process discovery: Unlike process discovery, which involves extracting and visualizing the actual process flow from event logs automatically, process enhancement focuses more on using this information to improve the process. In other words, while process discovery reveals the "as-is" process, process enhancement focuses on creating the "to-be" process.

2. Conformance checking: Process enhancement differs from conformance checking in that the latter is focused on comparing a predefined process model with a real-life event log. Conformance checking reveals how closely a business process aligns with the intended process model and can identify deviations. On the other hand, process enhancement uses data and insights from both process discovery and conformance checking to decide what improvements to implement to enhance the business process further.

To summarize, process enhancement goes beyond merely identifying and visualizing the process; it delves deeper into the data to explore avenues for improving the existing process based on insights discovered during process discovery and conformance checking stages.
