To create the required POWL models, we need to represent the hiring process with the specified steps and conditions. Below are the two POWL models based on the given textual description.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model includes an XOR branch that provides a subtle advantage to applicants with specific community affiliations.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness check
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR branch for cultural fit and community affiliation check
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the main workflow
main_workflow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_completeness_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    cultural_fit_xor,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define the order between nodes
main_workflow.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_xor)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

print(main_workflow)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model ensures all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process without any special community-based branch.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness check
data_completeness_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the main workflow
main_workflow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_completeness_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define the order between nodes
main_workflow.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_completeness_loop)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(data_completeness_loop, SkillAssessment)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
main_workflow.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

print(main_workflow)
```

These models capture the hiring process with and without the potential for bias due to community affiliations. The first model includes an XOR branch that can introduce unfairness, while the second model ensures fairness by applying the same cultural fit evaluation to all applicants.
