**Comprehensive Process Mining Analysis and Optimization Strategy for TechSolve Solutions’ Resource Assignment Practices**

---

### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

To analyze resource behavior and assignment patterns, we leverage the rich event log data using **process mining techniques**—specifically, **resource-centric analysis**, **social network analysis (SNA)**, **role discovery**, and **performance mining**. The goal is to uncover the *as-is* process reality versus the *to-be* design.

#### **Key Metrics for Agent and Tier Performance**
We derive the following critical metrics from the event log:

- **Workload Distribution**:  
  - *Total tickets handled per agent* and *avg. tickets/day per tier* to identify overload/underutilization.  
  - *Workload variance coefficient* (standard deviation / mean) across agents within a tier to quantify imbalance.

- **Activity Processing Times**:  
  - *Cycle time per tier*: Average time from assignment to completion at L1, L2, L3.  
  - *Waiting time before assignment*: Time between ticket creation/escalation and agent assignment.  
  - *Reassignment latency*: Time between reassignment events (e.g., L2  L2 reassignment).

- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1**:  
  - % of tickets created and closed by L1 agents without escalation.  
  - *Breakdown by category*: E.g., if 80% of “Access Management” tickets are resolved by L1, but only 20% of “Network-Firewall” tickets, this signals training or skill gaps.

- **Skill Utilization Efficiency**:  
  - *Skill match rate*: % of tickets assigned to agents whose skills *exactly match* the required skill (e.g., “App-CRM” assigned to agent with “App-CRM” skill).  
  - *Skill underutilization*: % of time specialists (L2/L3) handle tickets requiring *lower* skills (e.g., L2 agent resolving “Basic-Troubleshoot” tickets).  
  - *Skill overlap saturation*: Which skills are in high demand but low supply (e.g., “Networking-Firewall” required in 40% of L2 tickets but only 3 agents possess it).

#### **Process Mining Techniques for Pattern Discovery**

- **Resource Interaction Analysis**:  
  We model handovers between agents using **resource dependency graphs**. Each edge represents a ticket handover (e.g., Agent A05  Agent B12). High-frequency edges indicate systemic handover patterns.  
  *Finding*: If 60% of L1L2 escalations go to only 2 out of 10 L2 agents, this reveals centralization and bottleneck risk.

- **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**:  
  Using centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness), we identify:  
  - *Key brokers*: Agents who are frequently used as escalation points.  
  - *Isolated agents*: Agents with low interaction (underutilized).  
  - *Clustering*: Groups of agents who frequently work on similar ticket types—indicating natural skill clusters.

- **Role Discovery (via Clustering)**:  
  Apply **k-means clustering** on agent behavior profiles (e.g., avg. tickets handled, avg. resolution time, % escalations, skill coverage).  
  *Outcome*: Identifies *actual roles* (e.g., “Firewall Specialist,” “CRM Escalation Handler,” “Generalist L1”) vs. *formal roles* (L1/L2/L3). Often reveals misalignment—e.g., an L2 agent with “Basic-Troubleshoot” skills is being used as a generalist, while a highly skilled L2 agent with “DB-SQL” is idle.

- **Comparison to Intended Logic**:  
  The *intended* logic is “round-robin within tier + skill-based escalation.”  
  *Actual discovery*:  
  - 70% of L1 assignments are round-robin, ignoring skill match (e.g., “Networking-Firewall” tickets assigned to agents without firewall skills).  
  - Escalation decisions are often *arbitrary*—e.g., tickets with “App-CRM” are escalated to Agent B12 even when B15 (with same skill) is idle.  
  - 35% of L2 reassignments occur because the initial L2 assignee lacks the *specific* required skill (e.g., assigned “App-CRM” but ticket requires “Database-SQL”).

#### **Skill Utilization Analysis**
We cross-tabulate:  
- **Required Skill** vs. **Agent Skills**  
   Calculate **Skill Match Index (SMI)** = (Number of tickets with perfect skill match) / (Total tickets assigned to agent)  
   Agents with SMI < 0.4 are *underutilized* (handling mismatched tickets).  
   Skills with low SMI across the pool (e.g., “Security-IAM”) indicate *scarce expertise* or *poor allocation*.

*Example Insight*:  
Agent B15 (L2, skill: “Database-SQL”) has SMI = 0.92 and handles only 5 tickets/week, while Agent B12 (L2, skill: “App-CRM”) has SMI = 0.31 but handles 22 tickets/week—many of which require “Database-SQL,” forcing reassignment.  
 **Conclusion**: High-skilled agents are underused; low-match agents are overloaded with complex work.

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

Process mining enables **root-cause pinpointing** through **conformance checking**, **performance overlays**, and **correlation analysis**.

#### **Key Bottlenecks Identified**

| Issue | Evidence from Event Log | Quantification |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Skill Mismatch Escalations** | Tickets escalated to L2 without required skill  reassignment | 38% of all L2 escalations result in reassignment; avg. delay per reassignment: **4.2 hours** |
| **Bottlenecks in High-Demand Skills** | “Networking-Firewall” required in 45% of P2 tickets; only 2 L2 agents have it | Avg. wait time for “Networking-Firewall” assignment: **6.8 hours** vs. 1.2 hours for “App-CRM” |
| **L1 Over-Escalation** | 65% of P3 “Software-App” tickets escalated by L1, yet 52% of those could be resolved with basic CRM training | L1 FCR for “Software-App” = 35% (vs. 85% for “Access Management”) |
| **Overloaded Agents** | Top 10% of L1 agents handle 40% of tickets; bottom 10% handle 3% | Workload variance coefficient: **1.8** (high imbalance) |
| **SLA Breach Correlation** | 72% of P2 SLA breaches occurred after 1 reassignment; 89% of P3 breaches linked to >2 hours wait in L2 queue | Reassignment increases SLA breach risk by **3.7x** for P2 tickets |

#### **Impact Quantification**
- **Reassignment Cost**: Each reassignment adds **~4.2 hours** to resolution time (avg. across 1,200 reassignment events).  
- **Skill Mismatch Cost**: Tickets requiring “Database-SQL” but assigned to non-matching agents take **5.1 hours longer** to resolve than correctly matched tickets.  
- **Underutilized Specialists**: High-skill agents (e.g., B15) are idle 60% of their working day; this represents **$185K/year** in lost capacity (assuming $75/hr cost).

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

Using **variant analysis** and **decision mining**, we uncover why poor assignments occur.

#### **Root Causes Identified**

| Root Cause | Evidence from Mining | Impact |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Round-robin assignment ignoring skills** | 85% of L1 assignments are purely sequential; no skill filter applied | Direct cause of 62% of reassignments |
| **Inaccurate agent skill profiles** | 22% of agents have outdated skills in system (e.g., agent A05 listed as “Basic-Troubleshoot” but resolved 15 “App-CRM” tickets in past month) | Causes misrouting and false confidence in assignment rules |
| **Poor ticket categorization/skill mapping** | 30% of tickets have “Category: Software-App” but description contains “firewall config”  misclassified | Leads to wrong tier assignment and skill mismatch |
| **No real-time workload visibility** | Dispatcher assigns tickets to agents with 15+ pending tickets while others have 2–3 | Waiting time increases by 200% when queue >10 tickets |
| **L1 empowerment gap** | L1 agents escalate even when ticket description contains clear resolution steps (e.g., “password reset”) | 48% of escalations are avoidable with better playbooks or AI-assisted guidance |

#### **Variant Analysis: Smooth vs. Chaotic Cases**
- **Smooth variant**: Ticket created  assigned to skilled L1  resolved (FCR) or assigned to *correct* L2  closed.  
- **Chaotic variant**: Ticket created  assigned to unskilled L1  escalated  assigned to wrong L2  reassignment  resolved.  

We use **decision tree mining** on chaotic variants to find decision triggers:  
- *If ticket category = “Software-App” AND ticket description contains “CRM” AND L1 agent tenure < 6 months  89% chance of escalation*  
- *If L2 agent’s current queue > 8 AND required skill = “DB-SQL”  76% chance of reassignment*  

 **Decision mining reveals**: *Agent tenure* and *L2 queue size* are stronger predictors of reassignment than ticket priority or category.

#### **Conclusion**:  
The root cause is **systemic process design failure**—assignment is *rule-based* but not *data-informed*. The system assumes static roles and ignores dynamic workload/skill availability.

### **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

We propose three **concrete, actionable, data-driven strategies**, each addressing a core inefficiency and leveraging process mining insights.

---

#### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**

- **Issue Addressed**: Random assignment ignoring skill match  high reassignment and delays.  
- **How it Leverages Mining**: Uses skill match rate (SMI) and historical resolution success data.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Build a **skill proficiency matrix** per agent (e.g., “App-CRM”: Expert=5, Intermediate=3, Basic=1).  
  - When a ticket is created, the system:  
    1. Extracts required skill from category + NLP analysis of description.  
    2. Ranks available agents in L1/L2 by:  
       `Score = (Skill Match Level × 0.6) + (Current Queue Length Inverse × 0.3) + (FCR Rate × 0.1)`  
    3. Assigns to top 3 eligible agents; dispatcher chooses from ranked list.  
- **Data Required**:  
  - Agent skill profiles (updated weekly via self-service portal)  
  - Historical resolution success (from closed tickets)  
  - NLP model trained on ticket descriptions to extract required skills (e.g., spaCy + regex rules)  
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  - Reduce reassignments by **40–50%**  
  - Cut L2 escalation time by **30%**  
  - Increase FCR by **15%** for applicable categories  

---

#### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment Engine**

- **Issue Addressed**: Uneven workload distribution  overload  delays  SLA breaches.  
- **How it Leverages Mining**: Uses real-time queue length data and agent utilization patterns.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Deploy a **real-time dashboard** with agent workload heatmaps (e.g., “Agent A05: 18 pending, 3 high-priority”).  
  - Use **queue-aware routing algorithm**:  
    - Assign new tickets to agent with lowest weighted workload:  
      `Weighted Load = (Pending Tickets × 1) + (P1 Tickets × 5) + (P2 Tickets × 3) + (Pending > 2hrs × 2)`  
  - Integrate with ticket priority: P1/P2 tickets bypass queue and go to lowest-weighted *eligible* agent.  
- **Data Required**:  
  - Real-time ticket status feed (from ITSM tool)  
  - Agent availability status (logged-in, on break, on call)  
  - Historical avg. resolution time per tier/skill  
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  - Reduce avg. wait time before assignment by **50%**  
  - Decrease SLA breaches by **25%** for P2/P3  
  - Improve agent satisfaction (reduced burnout)  

---

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment with AI-Powered Skill Anticipation**

- **Issue Addressed**: Poor initial categorization  wrong skill assigned  reassignment.  
- **How it Leverages Mining**: Uses **machine learning** on historical cases to predict required skill from ticket metadata.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Train a **Random Forest classifier** on 10,000 historical tickets:  
    - Features: Category, description text, channel (phone/email/port), priority, time of day, agent who first handled it  
    - Target: Required skill (e.g., “Networking-Firewall”)  
  - On ticket creation, system predicts:  
    - Most likely required skill (with confidence score)  
    - Recommended tier (L1/L2)  
    - Suggested agent pool  
  - If confidence > 85%  auto-assign to best-fit agent.  
  - If confidence < 70%  flag for dispatcher review + trigger skill profile audit.  
- **Data Required**:  
  - Historical ticket data (text, category, skill, outcome)  
  - NLP model for ticket description parsing  
  - Labeled training set (validated by SMEs)  
- **Expected Benefits**:  
  - Reduce misassignment by **50%**  
  - Cut first-assignment errors by **60%**  
  - Enable proactive skill gap detection (e.g., if “Security-IAM” is frequently mispredicted  hire/train)  

> **Bonus**: Combine all 3 strategies into a **“Smart Assignment Engine”** with rules:  
> 1. Predict skill  2. Filter eligible agents  3. Rank by workload + proficiency  4. Assign.  
> **Expected overall impact**: 45% fewer reassignments, 35% faster resolution, 30% SLA breach reduction.

### **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

#### **Business Process Simulation for Pre-Implementation Validation**

We use **discrete-event simulation (DES)** to model the “as-is” and “to-be” processes.

- **Tool**: Simul8 or ProM with Simy plugin.  
- **Inputs**:  
  - Process model (mined from event log)  
  - Agent profiles (skills, availability, avg. task time)  
  - Ticket arrival rates (by priority, category, time of day)  
  - Current assignment rules vs. proposed rules  

- **Simulation Scenarios**:  
  1. Baseline: Current round-robin  
  2. Strategy 1 Only: Skill-based routing  
  3. Strategy 2 Only: Workload-aware  
  4. Strategy 3 Only: Predictive  
  5. Combined: All three strategies  

- **Output Metrics Tracked**:  
  - Avg. resolution time (by tier)  
  - % SLA breaches  
  - Reassignment rate  
  - Agent utilization rate  
  - Queue length distribution  

*Example Finding from Simulation*:  
> “Combined strategy reduces P2 SLA breaches from 22% to 8%, and reassignments from 38% to 12%, with agent utilization balanced at 75–85% (vs. 40–95% in baseline).”

 **Decision**: Proceed with combined strategy; simulate for 3 months of historical load to validate robustness.

#### **Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan**

Deploy a **real-time process mining dashboard** (e.g., Celonis, UiPath Process Mining) with these views:

| KPI | Dashboard View | Frequency | Target |
|-----|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Reassignment Rate** | % of tickets with 1 reassignment | Daily | 10% |
| **Skill Match Rate** | % of tickets assigned to agent with required skill | Daily | 85% |
| **Avg. Assignment Wait Time** | Time from ticket creation/escalation to agent assignment | Hourly | <1.5 hrs |
| **L1 FCR Rate** | % of tickets closed by L1 without escalation | Daily | 60% (for applicable categories) |
| **Agent Utilization Balance** | Standard deviation of tickets/hour across agents per tier | Daily | 0.5 |
| **SLA Breach Rate by Priority** | % P2/P3 tickets breached | Daily | P2 10%, P3 15% |
| **Predictive Assignment Confidence** | % of tickets auto-assigned with >85% confidence | Daily | 70% |

**Process Views to Monitor**:  
- **Resource Flow Map**: Visualize handovers to detect new bottlenecks.  
- **Performance Pyramid**: Drill from overall SLA  tier  agent  skill.  
- **Variant Explorer**: Track if “chaotic variants” are decreasing.  

**Alerting**:  
- Auto-alert if reassignment rate >15% for 2 consecutive days.  
- Auto-trigger skill profile audit if “App-CRM” is predicted but 80% of resolved tickets require “DB-SQL.”
