Based on the provided interview transcripts, I'll create a BPMN-like textual process model. Here's the output:

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval and Payment Process

**Activities/Tasks:**

1. Receive Invoice (Accounts Payable Clerk, Mary)
2. Validate PO (Accounts Payable Clerk, Mary)

7. Request Manager's Sign-off (Accounts Payable Clerk, Mary)
8. Manager's Approval (Department Manager, Carlos)

**Sequence Flow:**

2. Validate PO  Log Invoice into Accounting System (direct)
3. Log Invoice into Accounting System  Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department (direct)
4. Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department  Confirm Receipt of Goods (direct)
5. Confirm Receipt of Goods  Match Invoice Line Items against PO (direct)
6. Match Invoice Line Items against PO  Request Manager's Sign-off (direct)
7. Request Manager's Sign-off  Manager's Approval (direct)
8. Manager's Approval  Scheduling for Payment (direct)

**Gateways/Decision Points:**

1. **Decision:** PO Validation
	* Conditions: Invoice does not have a valid PO number
	* Actions: Send invoice back to supplier for additional information
2. **Decision:** Manager's Approval
	* Conditions: Discrepancies in invoice line items or receipts
	* Actions: Escalate to supervisor or investigate further

**Roles/Participants:**

**Exceptions/Variations:**

1. **Direct Escalation:** If Mary can't match the invoice or if Purchasing has an issue, she escalates it to Rita.
2. **Manager's Discretion:** If Carlos sees something suspicious in the invoice, he might reject it or ask Mary to hold it and investigate further.
3. **Contractual Discrepancies:** Karen helps resolve issues with contract terms and pricing discrepancies.

This BPMN-like textual process model captures the main activities, sequence flow, decision points, roles, and artifacts involved in the invoice approval and payment process. It also includes exception handling and variations highlighted in the interview transcripts.
