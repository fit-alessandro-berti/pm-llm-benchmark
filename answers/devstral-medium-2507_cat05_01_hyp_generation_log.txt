### Identifying Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

#### Anomalies in Event Logs

1. **Out-of-Order Activities:**
   - **Case ID 1002:** The event "Confirm Shipment" occurs before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock," which is not in line with the normal process flow.
   - **Case ID 1003:** The event "Ship Goods" occurs before "Confirm Shipment," which is also out of order.
   - **Case ID 1004:** The event "Receive Payment" occurs before "Issue Invoice," which is unusual.

2. **Missing Activities:**
   - **Case ID 1003:** The "Validate Stock" activity is missing.
   - **Case ID 1004:** The "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock" activities are missing.

3. **Unusual Timing:**
   - **Case ID 1002:** The "Receive Payment" event occurs very quickly after the "Issue Invoice" event, which might indicate a pre-payment or an error.
   - **Case ID 1004:** The "Receive Payment" event occurs before the "Issue Invoice" event, which is highly unusual.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Out-of-Order Activities:**
   - **System Errors:** There might be issues with the system recording the events in the correct sequence.
   - **Policy Violations:** Employees might be bypassing certain steps due to lack of enforcement or oversight.
   - **Training Issues:** Employees might not be properly trained on the correct sequence of activities.

2. **Missing Activities:**
   - **System Errors:** The system might not be recording all activities.
   - **Policy Violations:** Employees might be skipping certain steps intentionally.
   - **Training Issues:** Employees might not be aware of the necessity of certain steps.

3. **Unusual Timing:**
   - **System Errors:** There might be issues with the timestamp recording.
   - **Policy Violations:** Employees might be manipulating the timing of events.
   - **Training Issues:** Employees might not understand the importance of following the correct timing of activities.

### Proposed SQL Queries to Investigate Hypotheses

1. **Identify Out-of-Order Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (1002, 1003, 1004)
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
   ```

2. **Check for Missing Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (1003, 1004)
   GROUP BY case_id, activity
   HAVING COUNT(activity) < (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT activity) FROM order_event_log);
   ```

3. **Investigate Unusual Timing:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (1002, 1004)
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
   ```

4. **Cross-Reference with Orders Table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT o.case_id, o.customer_id, o.order_type, o.order_value, e.activity, e.timestamp
   FROM orders o
   JOIN order_event_log e ON o.case_id = e.case_id
   WHERE o.case_id IN (1002, 1003, 1004)
   ORDER BY o.case_id, e.timestamp;
   ```

5. **Cross-Reference with Resources Table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT e.case_id, e.activity, e.timestamp, r.role, r.department
   FROM order_event_log e
   JOIN resources r ON e.resource = r.resource_id
   WHERE e.case_id IN (1002, 1003, 1004)
   ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
   ```

These queries will help in further investigating the anomalies and understanding the underlying issues.
