The pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, which can be either standard or custom. The process involves various steps for validation, feasibility analysis, and approval before finalizing an invoice and sending a confirmation to the customer. Let's break down the process step-by-step:

### Start Event
**Purpose:** The process begins when a customer request is received.

### Task A: "Receive Customer Request"
**Purpose:** This task involves receiving and logging the customer's request into the system.

### Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type
**Purpose:** This exclusive gateway (XOR) splits the process into two paths based on the type of request: Standard or Custom.

#### Standard Request Path:
1. **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
   **Purpose:** This task validates the standard request against predefined criteria.

2. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
   **Purpose:** This parallel gateway (AND) splits the process into two parallel paths for simultaneous execution.
   
   - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
     **Purpose:** This task checks the customer's creditworthiness.
   
   - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
     **Purpose:** This task verifies if the requested items are in stock.

3. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
   **Purpose:** This is the synchronization point where both parallel tasks (C1 and C2) must be completed before proceeding.

4. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
   **Purpose:** This task calculates and sets the expected delivery date for the standard request.

#### Custom Request Path:
1. **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
   **Purpose:** This task assesses the feasibility of the custom request.

2. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
   **Purpose:** This exclusive gateway (XOR) splits the process based on the feasibility outcome.
   
   - **If Yes  Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
     **Purpose:** This task prepares a quotation for the custom request.
   
   - **If No  Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"  End Event**
     **Purpose:** This task sends a rejection notice to the customer and ends the process.

### After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed:
**Purpose:** This is the convergence point where the process continues after either the standard or custom path has been completed.

### Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"
**Purpose:** This exclusive gateway (XOR) determines whether manager approval is required based on certain criteria (e.g., high value orders, custom requests, etc.).

- **If Yes  Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
  **Purpose:** This task involves obtaining approval from a manager.

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
  **Purpose:** This exclusive gateway (XOR) checks the outcome of the manager's approval.
  
  - **If Yes  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
    **Purpose:** This task generates the final invoice for the customer.
  
  - **If No  Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
    **Purpose:** This task re-evaluates the conditions of the request.
    
    - **Loop back to Task E1 (for Custom Path) or Task D (for Standard Path)**
      **Purpose:** This loop allows for rework based on the re-evaluation outcome. For custom requests, it loops back to preparing a new quotation (Task E1), and for standard requests, it loops back to recalculating the delivery date (Task D).

- **If No Approval Needed  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
  **Purpose:** If approval is not needed, the process directly proceeds to generating the final invoice.

### Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"
**Purpose:** This task sends a confirmation to the customer, including the final invoice and delivery details.

### End Event
**Purpose:** The process ends after the confirmation is sent to the customer.

### Differences Based on Request Type:
- **Standard Requests:** Follow a straightforward path with validation, parallel checks (credit and inventory), and delivery date calculation.
- **Custom Requests:** Involve a feasibility analysis. If feasible, a custom quotation is prepared; if not, the request is rejected.

### Approval and Rework Conditions:
- **Approval Needed:** Triggered based on predefined criteria (e.g., high-value orders or custom requests). If approval is not granted, the process loops back to re-evaluate conditions and potentially rework the quotation (for custom requests) or delivery date (for standard requests).
- **Rework:** Occurs if manager approval is denied, allowing the process to loop back to earlier stages for adjustments.

In summary, this process efficiently handles both standard and custom customer requests by using gateways to direct the flow based on request type and approval needs, ensuring thorough validation, feasibility analysis, and timely rework where necessary.
