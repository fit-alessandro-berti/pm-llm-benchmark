POWl Model with Potential Unfairness

1. nodes = [ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
2. order = { ReceiveApplication --> DataCompletenessCheck, DataCompletenessCheck --> RequestMoreInfo, RequestMoreInfo --> SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment --> CulturalFitCheck, CulturalFitCheck --> CommunityAffiliationCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck --> ManagerialReview, CommunityAffiliationCheck --> FinalDecision }

This model shows a potential unfairness in the hiring process by introducing an XOR branch that allows applicants with local community affiliations or from particular educational backgrounds to receive preferential treatment during cultural fit evaluation. This bias can lead to unequal opportunities for candidates and create an imbalanced workforce.

POWl Model Without Unfairness

1. nodes = [ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]
2. order = { ReceiveApplication --> DataCompletenessCheck, DataCompletenessCheck --> RequestMoreInfo, RequestMoreInfo --> SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment --> CulturalFitCheck, CulturalFitCheck --> ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision }

This model removes the potential source of bias by ensuring that all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process. By eliminating any XOR branches or community-based advantages during this step, the hiring process becomes more transparent and fair for everyone involved.
