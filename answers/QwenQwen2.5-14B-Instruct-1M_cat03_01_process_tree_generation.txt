To construct the process tree for the hospital patient management scenario, we will break down the process into its constituent parts and use the operators to represent the sequence, choice, concurrency, and loop as specified. We'll use the `ProcessTree` class from `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj` to create the tree structure.

Here’s a step-by-step construction of the process tree:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Step 1: Arriving and Registration
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
A = ProcessTree(label="A", parent=root)
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG", parent=A)
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA", parent=RG)
root.children.append(A)
A.children.append(RG)
RG.children.append(IA)

# Step 2: Triage Process
triage = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=IA)
TI = ProcessTree(label="TI", parent=triage)
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC", parent=triage)
triage.children.append(TI)
triage.children.append(TC)
IA.children.append(triage)

# Step 3: Exclusive Choice based on Triage Classification
exclusive_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=TC)
CE = ProcessTree(label="CE", parent=exclusive_choice)
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP", parent=exclusive_choice)
exclusive_choice.children.append(CE)
exclusive_choice.children.append(FBP)
TC.children.append(exclusive_choice)

# Step 4: Loop for Abnormal Results
loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=exclusive_choice)
evaluation = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=loop)
SC = ProcessTree(label="SC", parent=evaluation)
exclusive_treatment = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=evaluation)
TM = ProcessTree(label="TM", parent=exclusive_treatment)
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT", parent=exclusive_treatment)
RDT = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=exclusive_treatment)
FCE = ProcessTree(label="FCE", parent=RDT)
FBA = ProcessTree(label="FBA", parent=RDT)
exclusive_treatment.children.append(TM)
exclusive_treatment.children.append(SPT)
RDT.children.append(FCE)
RDT.children.append(FBA)
evaluation.children.append(SC)
evaluation.children.append(exclusive_treatment)
loop.children.append(evaluation)
exclusive_choice.children.append(loop)

# Step 5: Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling
advanced_concurrency = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=loop)
AI = ProcessTree(label="AI", parent=advanced_concurrency)
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC", parent=advanced_concurrency)
advanced_concurrency.children.append(AI)
advanced_concurrency.children.append(NC)
loop.children.append(advanced_concurrency)

# Step 6: Follow-up Appointment and Discharge Instructions
followup_and_discharge = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=advanced_concurrency)
FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS", parent=followup_and_discharge)
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI", parent=followup_and_discharge)
followup_and_discharge.children.append(FAS)
followup_and_discharge.children.append(DDI)
advanced_concurrency.children.append(followup_and_discharge)

# Step 7: Billing, Insurance Claims Processing, and Medical Records Finalization
final_concurrency = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=followup_and_discharge)
BL = ProcessTree(label="BL", parent=final_concurrency)
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP", parent=final_concurrency)
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF", parent=final_concurrency)
final_concurrency.children.append(BL)
final_concurrency.children.append(ICP)
final_concurrency.children.append(MRF)
followup_and_discharge.children.append(final_concurrency)

# The root of the process tree is the starting point
print(root)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Arrival and Registration Process**: The patient arrives (`A`), registers (`RG`), and undergoes an intake assessment (`IA`). These steps are in sequence.
2. **Triage Process**: After intake assessment, the patient undergoes a triage interview (`TI`) and triage classification (`TC`), which are also in sequence.
3. **Exclusive Choice Based on Triage Classification**: Depending on the triage classification, the patient either undergoes a Comprehensive ECG (`CE`) or a Full Blood Panel (`FBP`), which are exclusive choices.
4. **Loop for Abnormal Results**: If the results are abnormal, the patient enters a loop. They are reviewed by a specialist (`SC`), and then undergo an exclusive choice of treatment (`TM` or `SPT`). After treatment, they undergo a re-diagnostic test (`RDT`), which itself is an exclusive choice (`FCE` or `FBA`). The loop continues if the results are still abnormal.
5. **Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling**: Once normal results are achieved, the patient undergoes advanced imaging (`AI`) and nutritional counseling (`NC`) in true concurrency.
6. **Follow-up Appointment and Discharge Instructions**: After the parallel activities, the patient schedules a follow-up appointment (`FAS`) and receives detailed discharge instructions (`DDI`).
7. **Final Administrative Steps**: In the final step, the patient's billing (`BL`), insurance claims processing (`ICP`), and medical records finalization (`MRF`) occur in true concurrency.

This process tree accurately models the entire complex hospital patient management scenario as specified.
