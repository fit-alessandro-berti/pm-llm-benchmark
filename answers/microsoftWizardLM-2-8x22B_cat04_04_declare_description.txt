 The declarative process model you've described outlines a process with a set of activities and constraints that govern their execution order and occurrence. Here's an overview of the process based on the constraints provided:

1. **Initialization**: The process starts with the activity "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE". This is the initial step in the process.

2. **Existence**: The activities "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", "Request Payment", "Payment Handled", and "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must occur at least once in the process.

3. **Exactly 1**: Each of the activities mentioned above must occur exactly once. This means that these activities are not repeated within the process.

4. **Responded Existence**: If any of the activities "Request Payment", "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", or "Payment Handled" occurs, the other two must also occur at some point in the process. This applies in both directions, creating a cycle of dependencies among these three activities.

5. **Alternate Response**: This constraint strengthens the response constraint by ensuring that once an activity occurs, the subsequent responsive activity occurs next without any other activities in between. The pairs of activities that have this relationship are:
   - ("Request Payment", "Payment Handled")
   - ("Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", "Payment Handled")
   - ("Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR")
   - ("Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", "Request Payment")
   - ("Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", "Payment Handled")
   - ("Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", "Request Payment")

6. **Precedence**: This constraint ensures that if a certain activity occurs, another specific activity must have occurred before it. The relationships are:
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Payment Handled" must have occurred before it.
   - If "Declaration FIN
