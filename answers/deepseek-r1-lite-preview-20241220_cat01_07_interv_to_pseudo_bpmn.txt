**Notes on Variations and Exceptions:**

- **Escalation to Supervisor:** If discrepancies cannot be resolved by the Accounts Payable Clerk, the invoice is escalated to the Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) for further investigation and resolution.
- **Supplier Involvement:** If the invoice lacks necessary information or has discrepancies, the Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) may be involved to communicate with the supplier and resolve issues.
- **Alternative Paths:** In cases where the invoice does not have a PO, the process includes requesting the missing information from the supplier before proceeding further.
- **Uncertainties:** The exact point at which the Supplier Relationship Manager is involved may vary depending on the nature of the issue; however, their role is generally to assist in resolving supplier-related discrepancies.
