To construct the POWL model for the described telecom service provisioning process, we need to follow the steps and use the classes provided. Here's how you can implement it in Python using the `pm4py` library:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Verify Service Request (SR)
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")

# Step 2: Contract Setup (CS)
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")

# Step 3: Datacenter Allocation (DA) and Access Control Initialization (ACI)
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")

# Partial order for DA and ACI
parallel_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# Step 4: Base Network Configuration (BNC) and Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")

# Loop for BNC followed by optional D&R
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 5: Exclusive choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD)
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 6: Quality Assurance (QA) and Security Audit (SA)
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")

# Partial order for QA and SA
final_checks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# Final step: Go-Live Approval (GLA)
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Construct the main POWL model
# Initial partial order: SR -> CS
initial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])
initial_order.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# After CS, parallel tasks DA and ACI
after_contract = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[initial_order, parallel_tasks])
after_contract.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
after_contract.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# After DA and ACI, loop configuration
after_parallel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[after_contract, loop_config])
after_parallel.order.add_edge(DA, loop_config)
after_parallel.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_config)

# After loop, deployment choice
after_loop = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[after_parallel, deployment_choice])
after_loop.order.add_edge(loop_config, deployment_choice)

# After deployment choice, final checks (QA and SA)
after_deployment = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[after_loop, final_checks])
after_deployment.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, QA)
after_deployment.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, SA)

# Finally, GLA after QA and SA
final_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[after_deployment, GLA])
final_order.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
final_order.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# The final POWL model is stored in `final_order`
# This represents the entire workflow as described.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Steps**: We start with verifying the Service Request (`SR`) and then setting up the contract (`CS`).
2. **Parallel Tasks**: After the contract setup, `DA` and `ACI` can be done concurrently.
3. **Loop Configuration**: Once both `DA` and `ACI` are complete, we enter a loop where `BNC` is performed, optionally followed by `DR` until stable.
4. **Deployment Choice**: After successful network configuration, an exclusive choice is made between `CD` and `MD`.
5. **Final Checks**: Both `QA` and `SA` must be completed before the final approval (`GLA`). These checks can be done concurrently or in any order.
6. **Final Approval**: Once all checks are complete, the `GLA` step occurs.

This POWL model faithfully represents the described scenario using the provided classes and constructs.
