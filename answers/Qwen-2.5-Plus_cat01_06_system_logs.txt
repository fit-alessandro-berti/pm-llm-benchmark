#### Explanation of Logic:

1. **Case Identification:** 
   - Cases were identified based on the logical grouping of user activities related to a specific document or task. For example, working on "Document1.docx" forms one case, reviewing "Report_Draft.pdf" forms another, and editing "Budget_2024.xlsx" forms yet another.
   - If an activity is part of a larger process that involves multiple applications but still revolves around a single document/task, it was grouped into the same case (e.g., drafting content in Word, replying to an email, referencing budget).

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - Raw actions like "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH," etc., were translated into higher-level activities such as "Open Document," "Draft Content," "Save Document," "Switch to Email," "Open Email," "Review Email," "Reply to Email," "Draft Email Response," "Send Email," "Open PDF," "Review PDF," "Highlight Key Findings," "Open Spreadsheet," "Update Budget Figures," "Insert New Row," "Reference Budget in Document," "Continue Working on Report," "Draft Executive Summary."
   - The goal was to create meaningful and consistent names that reflect the overall tasks being performed.

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - Each event includes a unique `Case ID` corresponding to the logical unit of work.
   - The `Activity Name` reflects the high-level action being taken.
   - The `Timestamp` remains unchanged from the original log.
   - Additional attributes are included where relevant to provide context (e.g., application name, window title, text typed).

This transformation creates a coherent narrative of the user's work sessions, making it easier to analyze using standard process mining tools. The resulting event log captures the essence of the user's interactions with various applications and documents, highlighting their workflow and productivity patterns.
