# **Data-Driven Process Mining Approach for TechSolve Solutions’ Resource Assignment Optimization**

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **1.1 Performance and Behavior Analysis**
To analyze agent and tier performance, I would leverage **process mining techniques** to extract key metrics from the event log:

- **Workload Distribution:**
  - **Agent-level:** Average number of tickets handled per agent, time spent per ticket, and ticket volume per agent.
  - **Tier-level:** Distribution of tickets across L1, L2, and L3, including escalation rates from L1 to L2/L3.
  - **Skill utilization:** Percentage of tickets assigned to agents with required skills vs. those without.

- **Activity Processing Times:**
  - **First-call resolution (FCR) rate** for L1 agents (percentage of tickets resolved without escalation).
  - **Time-to-resolution (TTR)** per priority level (P1-P4) and category.
  - **Escalation latency:** Time taken for L1 to escalate to L2/L3 and subsequent resolution times.

- **Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills:**
  - **Skill proficiency analysis:** Which agents resolve tickets with required skills most efficiently?
  - **Skill mismatch rate:** Percentage of tickets reassigned due to incorrect initial assignment.
  - **Category-wise performance:** Which categories (e.g., Networking, CRM) have the highest reassignments?

### **1.2 Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Discovery**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:**
  - Identify **hand-off patterns** (e.g., frequent reassignments between L1 and L2).
  - Detect **bottlenecks** where tickets linger in queues due to skill gaps.
- **Social Network Analysis (SNA):**
  - Model **agent collaboration networks** to see which agents frequently escalate to others.
  - Highlight **central agents** (highly connected) who may be overloaded.
- **Role Discovery:**
  - Compare **intended vs. actual assignment logic** (e.g., round-robin vs. skill-based routing).
  - Identify **unintended escalation paths** (e.g., L1  L2  L1 again).

### **1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis**
- **Specialized skill efficiency:**
  - Are L2/L3 agents spending time on tasks that could be handled by L1?
  - **Skill utilization heatmap:** Which skills are underutilized vs. overused?
- **Skill gap detection:**
  - Tickets requiring **Database-SQL** but assigned to agents without this skill.
  - **Reassignment rate per skill** (e.g., CRM tickets reassigned due to lack of CRM expertise).

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **2.1 Key Bottlenecks & Problems**
| **Issue** | **Detection Method** | **Quantifiable Impact** |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Skill Mismatch Bottlenecks** | High reassignment rate for specific skills (e.g., Networking-Firewall) | 30% of P2 tickets reassigned due to L1 lacking expertise |
| **Escalation Delays** | Long queue times before L2/L3 assignment | Average 2-hour delay before L2 picks up P3 tickets |
| **Incorrect Initial Assignments** | L1 agents resolving only 60% of P3 tickets without escalation | 40% of P3 tickets escalated unnecessarily |
| **Overloaded Agents** | Agents handling >15 tickets/day with high TTR | Top 10% of agents contribute to 60% of SLA breaches |
| **SLA Breach Correlation** | Process mining shows 70% of P2 SLA breaches linked to skill mismatches | P2 resolution time increased by 45% when wrongly assigned |

### **2.2 Root Cause Analysis**
- **Deficient Assignment Rules:**
  - Round-robin ignores **skill availability** and **current workload**.
- **Inaccurate Skill Profiles:**
  - Some agents claim skills they rarely use (e.g., "App-CRM" but rarely handle CRM tickets).
- **Poor Initial Categorization:**
  - Tickets labeled as "Software-App" but requiring "Database-SQL" skills.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
  - Dispatchers assign tickets without seeing **current agent availability**.
- **L1 Underempowerment:**
  - L1 agents lack **decision rights** to resolve complex tickets, leading to excessive escalations.

---
## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **3.1 Variant Analysis (Good vs. Bad Assignments)**
- **Successful Assignments:**
  - Tickets resolved in **first try** (no reassignments).
  - **Skill match rate >90%**.
- **Failed Assignments:**
  - **Multiple reassignments** (e.g., L1  L2  L1  L2).
  - **Long queue times** before correct skill assignment.
- **Decision Mining:**
  - Identify **key decision points** (e.g., escalation criteria) that lead to inefficiencies.
  - Example: If **P3 tickets with "App-CRM" skill** are often reassigned, refine escalation rules.

### **3.2 Key Findings from Analysis**
- **L1 agents resolve 70% of P4 tickets but only 40% of P3 tickets.**
- **L2 agents spend 30% of time on tasks that could be handled by L1.**
- **Firewall-related tickets have a 50% reassignment rate due to L1 skill gaps.**
- **Dispatchers assign tickets without considering **real-time workload** (e.g., assigning to agents already handling 10+ tickets).**

## **4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting**
- **Issue Addressed:** Incorrect initial assignments due to skill mismatches.
- **Process Mining Insight:** Identify which agents have **highest proficiency** in specific skills (e.g., Agent B12 resolves 90% of CRM tickets faster than others).
- **Implementation:**
  - Assign tickets to agents with **highest skill match** (not just any agent with the skill).
  - Use **historical resolution time data** to weight assignments.
- **Data Needed:**
  - Agent skill proficiency scores (derived from past ticket resolution success).
  - Ticket category  required skill mapping.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - **Reduction in reassignments by 40%** (from 50% to 30%).
  - **Faster resolution for P2/P3 tickets** (20% reduction in TTR).

### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment**
- **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution and overloaded agents.
- **Process Mining Insight:** Identify **agents with low current workload** vs. those **overloaded**.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use **real-time queue monitoring** to assign tickets to **least busy agents with required skills**.
  - Example: If Agent A05 has only 2 tickets and Agent A06 has 12, prioritize assigning to A05.
- **Data Needed:**
  - Real-time agent availability and current ticket load.
  - Historical response time data to predict bottlenecks.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - **30% reduction in agent burnout** (fewer overloaded agents).
  - **Smoother ticket flow** with fewer delays.

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Using Ticket Characteristics**
- **Issue Addressed:** Excessive escalations due to poor initial categorization.
- **Process Mining Insight:**
  - Analyze **ticket descriptions** (NLP) to predict required skills.
  - Example: Keywords like "SQL error"  assign to **Database-SQL** experts.
- **Implementation:**
  - Train a **machine learning model** to classify tickets into **skill requirements**.
  - Assign tickets to **best-matched agents** before L1 even touches them.
- **Data Needed:**
  - Historical ticket descriptions + required skills.
  - Agent resolution success rates per skill.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - **50% reduction in unnecessary escalations** (from L1 to L2).
  - **Faster first-response times** (P2 tickets resolved in <2 hours).
