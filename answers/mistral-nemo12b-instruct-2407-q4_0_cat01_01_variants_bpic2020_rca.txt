Based on the provided process variants and their performances, here are some process-specific considerations that might contribute to performance issues:

1. **Rejections and Iterations:**
   - Many process variants involve multiple rejections (e.g., by ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER) followed by resubmissions. This indicates inefficiencies in the initial review or approval processes.
     - *Root Cause:* Inadequate review criteria, lack of clarity in guidelines, or insufficient training for reviewers leading to frequent rejections.

2. **Involvement of Multiple Roles:**
   - Some variants involve multiple roles (EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER) in the process flow.
     - *Root Cause:* Excessive involvement might lead to delays due to coordination issues, waiting times between approvals, or lack of clear responsibilities.

3. **Variability in Process Flows:**
   - There are many different paths (variants) for processing declarations, leading to complexity and potential inefficiencies.
     - *Root Cause:* Lack of standardization or optimization in process flows can result in unnecessary steps or delays.

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Some variants have high frequencies but low performances, indicating that these paths might be slower due to additional steps or wait times.
     - *Root Cause:* Longer process durations could be attributed to excessive review cycles, manual interventions, or lack of automation in certain steps.

5. **Missing Information (MISSING):**
   - Some variants include 'MISSING' as a rejection reason, indicating that incomplete information might cause delays.
     - *Root Cause:* Inadequate data validation checks at the initial submission stage could lead to frequent rejections and resubmissions due to missing or incorrect information.

To improve performance, consider the following targeted actions:

- Streamline review processes and provide clear guidelines for reviewers.
- Establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) to minimize variability in process flows.
- Implement automation where possible to reduce manual intervention and waiting times.
- Enhance data validation checks at submission stages to minimize rejections due to missing information.
