**Final Process Tree Model:**
```
Sequence
 Activity: 'Receive Application (RA)'
 Sequence
    Activity: 'Validate Form (VF)'
    Activity: 'Assess Eligibility (AE)'
    Parallel
        Loop
           Activity: 'Request Missing Info (RMI)'
           Activity: 'Validate Form (VF)'
        Activity: 'Approval Decision (AD)'
 Sequence
     Activity: 'Send Confirmation (SC)'
     Activity: 'Archive Case (AC)'
```

**Explanation:**
1. The process starts with the activity 'Receive Application (RA)'.
2. Following this, there is a sequence of activities where 'Validate Form (VF)' and 'Assess Eligibility (AE)' are executed sequentially.
3. After assessing eligibility, there is a loop that allows for multiple iterations of 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' followed by 'Validate Form (VF)' if necessary.
4. Once all required validations are completed, 'Approval Decision (AD)' is made.
5. Finally, the process moves to a sequence where 'Send Confirmation (SC)' is followed by 'Archive Case (AC)'.

This structure captures the main flow of the process, the optional repetition of validation steps, and the subsequent confirmation and archival activities.
