Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, there are three cases here, each with some activities. I need to check which ones are violating the normative rules and which are just failing the desiderata. 

Starting with Case 1. Let me look at each activity in order. The application was received at 09:00, then credit check at 09:30, risk assessment at 10:00, loan decision at 11:00, inform applicant at 13:00, finalize documentation at 13:30, and close case at 14:00. That seems to follow the exact sequence: application  credit check  risk assessment  loan decision  inform  finalize  close. So, no issues here in terms of the strict rules. 

Moving on to Case 2. Let's check the order. Application received at 08:00, then risk assessment at 09:00, which is before the credit check at 09:20. Oh, that's a problem. Credit check was supposed to come before risk assessment, so that's a violation of the normative rules. 

After that, the loan decision was made at 09:30, which is after the credit check, so that part is okay. But then, the documentation was finalized at 10:00 even though the loan was rejected. That's not allowed; you shouldn't finalize documentation after a rejection. So that's another violation. 

Also, the case was closed at 10:30 without informing the applicant, but wait, in the log, the loan decision was made at 09:30, and the inform activity is missing. So they didn't inform the applicant about the rejection. That might be a desideratum violation because they should inform them promptly, but it's not a rule, just a recommendation. Hmm, actually, looking back, the desiderata mentions informing the applicant within 48 hours, and here it's done after the decision but maybe not promptly. But since it's a desideratum, it's not a violation, just not meeting the recommendation. 

Case 3: Application received at 09:00, credit check at 10:00 on the 14th, which is more than 24 hours later. The normative rules only require it to happen before the risk assessment, but here, the timing is slow. That's a desideratum because it's a recommended timing, not a strict rule. So that's not a violation, just not following the best practice. 

Then, the inform applicant was done on the 17th, which is more than 48 hours after the decision on the 14th. Again, that's late, but since it's a desideratum, it's not a violation. 

They also didn't have a follow-up call, which is another desideratum. So that's a failure to meet the recommendation but not a violation. 

So, summarizing:

Case 2 violated two normative rules: performing risk assessment before credit check and finalizing documentation after rejection. Case 3 failed the desiderata by taking longer than recommended for credit check and informing the applicant late and missing the follow-up call.

**Case Analysis:**

1. **Case 1**: 
   - **Normative Rules Compliance**: Fully adhered to the sequence without any violations.
   - **Desiderata**: Met both the timing and follow-up recommendations.

2. **Case 2**:
   - **Normative Rules Violations**: 
     - Risk assessment occurred before credit check.
     - Documentation finalized after loan rejection.
   - **Desiderata**: Informed applicant promptly (though within 48 hours is a recommendation, not a rule).

3. **Case 3**:
   - **Desiderata Violations**:
     - Credit check delayed beyond 24 hours.
     - Inform applicant and follow-up call delayed beyond recommendations.

**Conclusion**: Cases 2 and 3 have issues mainly with the desiderata, while Case 2 also violates normative rules, which is more critical.
