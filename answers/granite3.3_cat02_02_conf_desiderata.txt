### 1. Normative Rule Violations

**Case 2:**  
- **Violation**: Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check.  
  - **Reason**: The process requires that a Credit Check must precede the Risk Assessment. Case 2 directly contravenes this rule by conducting Risk Assessment (2024-01-11 09:00) before performing the Credit Check (2024-01-11 09:30).

**Case 2:**  
- **Violation**: Finalize Documentation occurred after a rejection.  
  - **Reason**: The rules stipulate that if a loan is rejected, documentation should not be finalized before closing the case. Here, Finalize Documentation (2024-01-11 10:00) happened post rejection, which violates this normative constraint.

### 2. Desiderata Violations

**Case 1:**  
- **Violation**: Application received to Credit Check took more than 24 hours (30 minutes).  
  - **Reason**: While not a strict rule, it is preferred that the Credit Check be completed within 24 hours of receiving the application. Case 1's timing exceeds this recommendation by 30 minutes.

**Case 2:**  
- **Violation**: Inform Applicant happened more than 48 hours after Loan Decision (10 hours).  
  - **Reason**: The desideratum recommends informing applicants within 48 hours of the loan decision. In this case, notification occurred 10 hours post-decision, thus falling short of this recommendation.

**Case 3:**  
- **Violation**: Inform Applicant happened more than 48 hours after Loan Decision (nearly 2 days).  
  - **Reason**: Case 3's timing for Informing Applicant (2024-01-16 15:00) is far beyond the recommended 48-hour window, thus violating this desideratum.

**Case 3:**  
- **Violation**: No Follow-up Call recorded.  
  - **Reason**: Although not strictly required, performing a follow-up call before closing the case is encouraged as a good practice to ensure alignment between parties. Case 3 lacks such a record, indicating this desideratum was not met.

### Interpretations/Justifications:

- **Case 2 Violations**: Despite the clear normative violations in Case 2, these errors might reflect systemic or procedural gaps rather than intentional disregard for rules. They could be due to technical glitches, human oversight, or a lack of proper enforcement mechanisms within the loan processing workflow.

- **Desiderata Deviations**: The observed delays and absence of a follow-up call in Cases 1, 2, and 3 suggest areas for process improvement rather than rule breaches. These can be addressed through training, process automation, or enhanced communication protocols to meet best practices without impacting compliance with strict rules.

In conclusion, while Case 2's violations are direct and evident, Cases 1 and 3 represent opportunities for refinement to align more closely with recommended practices, thereby potentially enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency without compromising adherence to the core normative constraints.
