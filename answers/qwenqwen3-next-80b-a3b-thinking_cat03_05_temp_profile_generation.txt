<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to create a temporal profile dictionary for a supply chain process with various activities. The user wants a Python dictionary where each key is a tuple of two activities (like ('SS', 'OP')), and the value is a tuple of average time and standard deviation in seconds. The key here is that the pairs don't have to be directly consecutive; they can be any pairs where in some trace, one activity follows the other eventually, even with other activities in between.

First, I need to list all the activities mentioned: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. So there are 10 activities. Now, the temporal profile should include pairs that eventually follow each other in some trace. But not all possible pairs, just a representative subset. The user says "a representative subset of these activity pairs, ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps."

So, for example, SS to OP is direct, but maybe SS to RC would involve OP in between. But in the temporal profile, the time between SS and RC would be the time from SS to RC regardless of OP. Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: "for a given trace like <A,B,C,D>, the pairs (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), and (C,D) must be considered." So even if there are activities in between, all possible pairs where the first activity comes before the second in the trace are considered. So for example, in a trace SS -> OP -> RC -> QI, the pairs would include (SS, OP), (SS, RC), (SS, QI), (OP, RC), (OP, QI), (RC, QI). So even if they're not consecutive, all possible ordered pairs where the first is before the second in the trace.

But in the temporal profile, for each such pair across all traces, we calculate the average time between them and the standard deviation. So for example, the time between SS and RC would be the time from when SS happens until RC happens, which includes OP and possibly other activities. But in reality, for a trace like SS -> OP -> RC, the time between SS and RC is the sum of SS to OP and OP to RC. But the temporal profile would capture that total time.

So the task is to estimate for various pairs (not necessarily direct) the average time and std dev. The user wants a Python dictionary with these values. But I need to make sure that the pairs included are a representative subset, not all possible pairs (since there are 10 activities, there are 45 possible ordered pairs where first comes before second, but maybe not all are present in the logs). But the problem says "for each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other)".

So I need to pick some pairs that are meaningful in the supply chain, including some that are separated by multiple steps. Let's think about the typical flow.

Let's outline the typical sequence of activities in the supply chain:

SS -> OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT -> AS.

But maybe there are variations. For example, after PK, sometimes it goes to WS before DT, but maybe sometimes DT is direct. Or maybe after PT, there's some rework, but perhaps in the standard case, it's PT -> PK -> WS -> DT. Also, AS might come after DT.

But for the temporal profile, even non-adjacent pairs need to be considered. For example, SS to QI would involve OP and RC. So the time from SS to QI would be the sum of SS to OP, OP to RC, and RC to QI. But the actual time between SS and QI would be the total time from SS start to QI start.

But the problem is that in reality, the temporal profile is calculated per pair across all traces. So for each pair (X, Y), where in some trace X comes before Y, we collect all the time differences between X and Y in those traces, then compute average and std dev.

So for example, (SS, RC) would have a certain average time. Let's think about the typical time between SS and RC. SS is selecting the supplier, then OP is placing the order, then RC is receiving components. So the time between SS and RC would include the time for SS (maybe a few hours), then OP (maybe a day), then the lead time from supplier to receive components (maybe weeks). So SS to RC could be, say, 2 weeks on average. But the standard deviation might be high because some suppliers are faster, others slower.

Similarly, SS to DT would be the entire process time, which could be several weeks, with high std dev.

But the user wants a representative subset. So maybe pick some key pairs that are not adjacent. Let's list possible pairs that might be interesting.

First, direct consecutive pairs:

SS -> OP: maybe short time, like a few hours.

OP -> RC: lead time from supplier, maybe days to weeks.

RC -> QI: inspection time, maybe a day.

QI -> CA: assembly time, maybe a few days.

CA -> PT: testing time, maybe a day.

PT -> PK: packaging, maybe a day.

PK -> WS: storage time, maybe a few days.

WS -> DT: shipping time, maybe a day.

DT -> AS: after-sales, but that's after delivery, so maybe the time between DT and AS is when the customer uses the product and then contacts support, which could be variable.

But also non-consecutive pairs. For example:

SS -> QI: time from selection to quality inspection. That would include OP and RC. So maybe 2-3 weeks.

OP -> PT: order placed to product testing. That would include RC, QI, CA. So maybe 3-4 weeks.

SS -> DT: entire process time, maybe 4-6 weeks.

PK -> DT: packaging to shipping. If WS is involved, then PK to WS to DT. So PK to DT could be the time in storage plus shipping time.

WS -> DT: maybe a few days.

Also, maybe some pairs that are not in the main path. For example, after CA, maybe some rework steps, but perhaps in the standard case, it's direct. But the problem states "eventually following each other in at least one process execution", so even if some pairs are not always present, but in some traces they are, they should be included. But for simplicity, perhaps assume the main path.

But the user says "a representative subset", so maybe include some of the key non-adjacent pairs.

Let's think of possible pairs to include. Let's list possible ones.

For example:

- (SS, OP): direct, but maybe short time.

- (SS, RC): SS to receive components, which includes OP and supplier lead time.

- (SS, PT): from supplier selection to product testing. That would include OP, RC, QI, CA.

- (OP, PK): order placed to packaging. Which would include RC, QI, CA, PT.

- (RC, DT): receive components to distribution. That would include QI, CA, PT, PK, WS.

- (CA, AS): assembly to after-sales support. But AS is after DT, so CA to AS would include PT, PK, WS, DT, then AS. But AS usually starts after delivery, so the time between CA and AS could be the total time from assembly to after-sales, which is the entire process time plus some time after delivery.

But maybe some of these pairs are too long. Let's think in terms of realistic time estimates.

Let's convert all times to seconds for consistency.

First, let's consider typical timeframes:

- Hours: 3600 seconds.

- Days: 86400 seconds (24*3600).

- Weeks: 7*86400 = 604800 seconds.

- Months: ~2.6 million seconds (but maybe weeks are more relevant for this process).

Let's think of each activity's time in the process.

For example:

- SS: selecting a supplier might take a few days. But in the temporal profile, the time between SS and OP is the time between SS and OP. So SS to OP could be, say, 1 day (86400 seconds), with std dev of 12 hours (43200 seconds).

OP to RC: supplier lead time. Suppose average 2 weeks (1,209,600 seconds), std dev 3 days (259200 seconds).

RC to QI: quality inspection takes maybe 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours.

QI to CA: assembly might take 3 days (259200), std dev 1 day.

CA to PT: testing could be 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours.

PT to PK: packaging, maybe 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours.

PK to WS: storage in warehouse for a few days. Suppose average 3 days (259200), std dev 1 day.

WS to DT: shipping time. Maybe 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours.

DT to AS: after-sales support starts after delivery. The time between DT and AS could be variable. Maybe customers contact support after a few days or weeks. Average maybe 7 days (604800), std dev 3 days.

But also, for non-consecutive pairs:

SS to RC: SS -> OP -> RC. So total time is SS-OP + OP-RC. So average would be sum of their averages. But the temporal profile's average for (SS, RC) would be the sum of the time from SS to OP plus OP to RC. So if SS-OP is 1 day, OP-RC is 2 weeks, then SS-RC is 15 days. But the actual process may have variations. So average time for SS-RC would be 1 day + 14 days = 15 days. But maybe the standard deviation would be sqrt( (std1)^2 + (std2)^2 ), but actually, the std dev for the sum of two independent variables is sqrt(var1 + var2). However, in reality, the temporal profile is computed directly from the data, so the std dev would be based on the actual differences observed between SS and RC across traces. So for example, if sometimes OP takes longer, or RC takes longer, the total would have higher std dev.

But for the purpose of this problem, the LLM should estimate reasonable numbers. So perhaps:

SS to RC: average 15 days (1,296,000 seconds), std dev 5 days (432,000 seconds).

Similarly, SS to PT: SS -> OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT. So sum of all those times. Let's see:

SS-OP: 1 day

OP-RC: 14 days

RC-QI: 1 day

QI-CA: 3 days

CA-PT: 1 day

Total: 1+14+1+3+1 = 20 days. So average 1,728,000 seconds (20*86400). Std dev: perhaps higher. Let's say 7 days (604,800 seconds).

OP to PK: OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK.

OP-RC: 14 days

RC-QI: 1 day

QI-CA: 3 days

CA-PT: 1 day

PT-PK: 1 day

Total: 14+1+3+1+1 = 20 days. So average 1,728,000 seconds. Std dev maybe similar.

RC to DT: RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT.

RC-QI: 1

QI-CA:3

CA-PT:1

PT-PK:1

PK-WS:3

WS-DT:1

Total: 1+3+1+1+3+1 = 10 days. Average 864000 seconds. Std dev maybe 4 days (345600).

PK to DT: PK -> WS -> DT. So PK-WS is 3 days, WS-DT is 1 day. Total 4 days. Average 345600 seconds. Std dev 2 days (172800).

WS to DT: 1 day, but perhaps sometimes stored longer. Average 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours (43200).

SS to AS: SS to DT is 20 days (assuming SS to PT is 20 days, then PT to PK, etc., but DT to AS may take some time. Let's say SS to DT is 25 days (approx), then DT to AS average 7 days. So SS to AS would be 32 days. But maybe not. Alternatively, SS to AS would be the entire process plus after-sales start time. But AS usually starts after the product is delivered, so time between SS and AS would be time until delivery plus time until support is needed. But the problem is that AS is an activity that happens after DT. So the time between SS and AS would be the time from SS to AS, which includes all steps up to DT and then the time until AS starts. But AS might be triggered by customer issues, which could be days or weeks after delivery. So maybe SS to AS is 25 days (SS to DT) plus 7 days (DT to AS), total 32 days. Average 2,764,800 seconds. Std dev maybe 10 days.

But this is getting complicated. Let's pick a few key pairs. The problem says "a representative subset", so maybe 5-10 pairs.

Possible pairs to include:

- (SS, OP): direct, short time.

- (OP, RC): supplier lead time.

- (RC, QI): quality inspection.

- (CA, PT): assembly to testing.

- (PT, PK): testing to packaging.

- (PK, WS): packaging to storage.

- (WS, DT): storage to distribution.

- (SS, RC): SS to receive components.

- (SS, PT): SS to product testing.

- (RC, DT): receive components to distribution.

- (PK, DT): packaging to distribution.

- (DT, AS): distribution to after-sales.

Also, maybe (CA, AS), but that's a long time.

Let's think of realistic numbers for each.

Let's convert to seconds:

SS to OP: maybe 8 hours (28800 seconds), std dev 2 hours (7200).

OP to RC: average 2 weeks (1,209,600), std dev 3 days (259200).

RC to QI: 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours (43200).

QI to CA: 3 days (259200), std dev 1 day (86400).

CA to PT: 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours (43200).

PT to PK: 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours (43200).

PK to WS: 3 days (259200), std dev 1 day (86400).

WS to DT: 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours (43200).

DT to AS: average 7 days (604800), std dev 3 days (259200).

Now for non-consecutive:

SS to RC: SS->OP->RC. So sum of SS-OP and OP-RC. So average 28800 + 1209600 = 1,238,400. But maybe the actual time is more like 15 days (1,296,000), because SS-OP might be 1 day (86400), OP-RC 14 days. Let's adjust.

Let's say SS-OP is 1 day (86400), std dev 12 hours (43200).

OP-RC: 14 days (1,209,600), std dev 3 days (259200).

So SS-RC average would be 86400 + 1,209,600 = 1,296,000. Std dev: sqrt(43200^2 + 259200^2)  sqrt(1.866e9 + 6.718e10)  sqrt(6.9e10)  263,000 seconds. But maybe the actual std dev is higher because the OP-RC time varies a lot. Alternatively, maybe the temporal profile for SS-RC would have a std dev of 4 days (345,600).

Similarly, SS to PT: SS->OP->RC->QI->CA->PT.

SS-OP: 1 day

OP-RC: 14 days

RC-QI: 1 day

QI-CA: 3 days

CA-PT: 1 day

Total: 1+14+1+3+1=20 days. So 1,728,000 seconds.

Std dev: sum of individual std devs in quadrature. But for simplicity, maybe 7 days (604,800).

RC to DT: RC->QI->CA->PT->PK->WS->DT.

RC-QI: 1 day

QI-CA:3

CA-PT:1

PT-PK:1

PK-WS:3

WS-DT:1

Total: 1+3+1+1+3+1=10 days. 864,000 seconds.

Std dev: maybe 4 days (345,600).

PK to DT: PK->WS->DT. So PK-WS (3 days) + WS-DT (1 day) = 4 days. Average 345,600 seconds. Std dev: sqrt(86400^2 + 43200^2)  96,000 seconds. But maybe just 2 days (172,800).

DT to AS: after delivery, customers might contact support after a week or so. So average 7 days (604,800), std dev 3 days (259,200).

Now, let's check if all these pairs are included.

Also, maybe some other pairs like OP to PK: OP to RC to QI to CA to PT to PK. Let's see: OP-RC (14) + RC-QI (1) + QI-CA (3) + CA-PT (1) + PT-PK (1) = 20 days. Average 1,728,000. Std dev similar to SS-PT.

But perhaps the user wants a subset. Let's pick a few that are representative.

The problem says "a representative subset of these activity pairs, ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps."

So including some pairs with multiple steps in between.

Possible pairs to include:

- (SS, OP)

- (OP, RC)

- (RC, QI)

- (CA, PT)

- (PT, PK)

- (PK, WS)

- (WS, DT)

- (SS, RC)

- (SS, PT)

- (RC, DT)

- (PK, DT)

- (DT, AS)

So let's create a dictionary with these.

Let's assign realistic numbers.

Let's convert all to seconds.

SS to OP:

Average: 86400 (1 day)

Std dev: 43200 (12 hours)

OP to RC:

Average: 1,209,600 (14 days)

Std dev: 259,200 (3 days)

RC to QI:

Average: 86,400 (1 day)

Std dev: 43,200 (12 hours)

CA to PT:

Average: 86,400 (1 day)

Std dev: 43,200 (12 hours)

PT to PK:

Average: 86,400 (1 day)

Std dev: 43,200 (12 hours)

PK to WS:

Average: 259,200 (3 days)

Std dev: 86,400 (1 day)

WS to DT:

Average: 86,400 (1 day)

Std dev: 43,200 (12 hours)

SS to RC:

Average: 86400 + 1,209,600 = 1,296,000 (15 days)

Std dev: sqrt(43200^2 + 259200^2)  sqrt(1.866e9 + 6.718e10) = sqrt(6.9e10)  262,800. Let's round to 260,000. But maybe better to say 345,600 (4 days) for simplicity.

SS to PT:

Sum of SS-OP (1), OP-RC (14), RC-QI (1), QI-CA (3), CA-PT (1)  20 days. 20*86400=1,728,000.

Std dev: 7 days (604,800).

RC to DT:

RC-QI (1) + QI-CA (3) + CA-PT (1) + PT-PK (1) + PK-WS (3) + WS-DT (1) = 10 days  864,000 seconds.

Std dev: 4 days (345,600).

PK to DT:

PK-WS (3) + WS-DT (1)  4 days  345,600 seconds.

Std dev: 2 days (172,800).

DT to AS:

Average: 7 days (604,800), std dev 3 days (259,200).

Now, let's check if all these are reasonable.

Another pair: QI to CA. Let's see, but maybe not included. But the user said "a representative subset", so maybe not all possible.

Let's list the dictionary entries:

{
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 43200),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 259200),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 43200),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 43200),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (259200, 86400),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1296000, 345600),  # 15 days avg, 4 days std dev
    ('SS', 'PT'): (1728000, 604800),   # 20 days avg, 7 days std dev
    ('RC', 'DT'): (864000, 345600),    # 10 days avg, 4 days std dev
    ('PK', 'DT'): (345600, 172800),    # 4 days avg, 2 days std dev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200)
}

Wait, let's check the numbers again.

For SS to RC: 15 days is 15*86400=1,296,000. Yes.

SS to PT: 20 days * 86400 = 1,728,000.

RC to DT: 10 days * 86400 = 864,000.

PK to DT: 4 days * 86400 = 345,600.

DT to AS: 7 days * 86400 = 604,800.

Std devs:

SS to RC: 4 days (4*86400=345,600)

SS to PT: 7 days (7*86400=604,800)

RC to DT: 4 days (345,600)

PK to DT: 2 days (172,800)

DT to AS: 3 days (259,200)

Yes.

Now, other pairs like (OP, PK) could be included, but perhaps the subset is okay as is.

Also, maybe (QI, CA), but that's a direct pair. Let's see: QI to CA is part of the process. Average time might be 3 days (259,200), std dev 1 day (86,400). But maybe the user wants to include some of those. But the problem says "a representative subset", so maybe include some of the non-consecutive ones.

Alternatively, maybe include (CA, PK), but PK comes after PT, so CA to PK would be CA->PT->PK. So average 1+1=2 days. But perhaps.

But perhaps the current list is sufficient. Let's see.

Another possible pair: (WS, AS), but AS comes after DT, so WS to AS would be WS->DT->AS. So average 86400 + 604800 = 691,200. But maybe not necessary.

But the current list seems okay.

Let's check if all the pairs are valid. For example, in a trace, SS comes before OP, which comes before RC, etc. So all these pairs would exist in some trace.

So the dictionary would look like the one above.

Let me check the numbers again for each.

SS-OP: 1 day avg (86400), std dev 12h (43200).

OP-RC: 14 days (1,209,600), std dev 3 days (259,200).

RC-QI: 1 day (86400), 12h std.

CA-PT: 1 day, 12h std.

PT-PK: same.

PK-WS: 3 days (259,200), std dev 1 day (86,400).

WS-DT: 1 day (86,400), 12h std.

SS-RC: 15 days (1,296,000), 4 days std (345,600).

SS-PT: 20 days (1,728,000), 7 days std (604,800).

RC-DT: 10 days (864,000), 4 days std (345,600).

PK-DT: 4 days (345,600), 2 days std (172,800).

DT-AS: 7 days (604,800), 3 days std (259,200).

Yes. These seem reasonable.

Another check: for example, PK to DT is 4 days average. But if PK to WS is 3 days, WS to DT is 1 day, then total 4. Yes.

Similarly, RC to DT: RC to QI (1) + QI-CA (3) + CA-PT (1) + PT-PK (1) + PK-WS (3) + WS-DT (1)  1+3+1+1+3+1=10 days. Yes.

So the numbers make sense.

I think this is a good subset. Now, to write this as a Python dictionary.
