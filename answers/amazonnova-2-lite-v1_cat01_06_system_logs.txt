### Event Log for Process Mining

Below is the transformed event log, structured for use in standard process mining tools. Each row represents an event with the required attributes: **Case ID**, **Activity Name**, and **Timestamp**. Additional context (like **App** and **Window**) is included for clarity, but the essential attributes for process mining are emphasized.

### Explanation of Transformation Logic

#### **1. Case Identification**
The key to grouping events into **cases** is to identify **logical units of work** performed by the user. In this log, a "case" corresponds to a **coherent task** such as:
- Editing a specific document (`Document1.docx`, `Quarterly_Report.docx`).
- Handling a specific email (the reply to the “Annual Meeting” email).
- Reviewing a PDF document (`Report_Draft.pdf`).
- Updating a spreadsheet (`Budget_2024.xlsx`).

We **infer case boundaries** based on:
- **Application and document context**: Each unique document or email thread represents a distinct unit of work.
- **Temporal continuity**: Events that happen in sequence on the same document or within the same application are grouped together.
- **Closing actions**: When a document is closed (`CLOSE`), we consider the editing task complete, marking the end of a case.
- **Switching context**: When the user switches to a new application or document (`SWITCH`), we often start a new case.

The **Case IDs** (`C1`, `C2`, etc.) are assigned sequentially based on when a new logical task begins.

#### **2. Activity Naming**
Raw system actions like `FOCUS`, `TYPING`, `SAVE`, `CLICK`, etc., are **abstracted into higher-level, meaningful activities**. This abstraction makes the log more interpretable for process mining.

**Standardized Activity Names Used:**
- **Start Editing Document / Start Editing Report**: When focus shifts to a new document or report for the first time in a case.
- **Edit Document / Edit Spreadsheet / Edit Report**: Used for typing or making changes within a document, spreadsheet, or report.
- **Insert Reference**: Specific action of inserting a reference to the budget into a document.
- **Save Document / Save Spreadsheet / Save Report**: Whenever the user explicitly saves a file.
- **Finish Editing Document / Finish Editing Report**: When the user closes the document or report — indicating task completion.
- **Open Email**: When the user clicks to open an email.
- **Reply to Email**: When the user initiates a reply to an email.
- **Compose Reply**: The actual typing/composition of the reply.
- **Send Email**: When the user sends the email.
- **View PDF Document**: When the user opens and scrolls through a PDF.
- **Highlight PDF Section**: When the user highlights a section of the PDF.

**Why this abstraction?**
- It aligns with **business process semantics** — we care about *what the user is trying to accomplish*, not the low-level UI interactions.
- It enables **meaningful discovery of process patterns** in tools like ProM, Disco, or Celonis.

#### **3. Timestamp**
The timestamp is retained **as-is** from the original log. It is crucial for process mining as it allows for **temporal analysis**, such as duration calculations and sequencing.

#### **4. Additional Notes**
- **Multiple events within the same case**: For example, in `C1`, we see multiple `Edit Document` events because the user typed in two different sections of `Document1.docx`. These are kept separate to preserve the granularity of actions.
- **Case reuse**: The same document (`Document1.docx`) appears in two cases (`C1` and later again when inserting a reference). We treat these as **separate instances** of work because they are disjointed in time and context.
- **Switching applications**: Actions like `SWITCH` were used to **identify transitions between cases**, but they were **not included as activities** in the final log — they are merely contextual cues.

### Summary
This transformed event log captures **user work as a sequence of structured events**, grouped into meaningful cases and expressed using **business-oriented activity names**. The log is ready for process mining analysis, enabling discoveries about typical user behavior, bottlenecks, and optimizations in the workflow.
