## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### **a. Data Integration and Preprocessing**
To perform effective process mining, it’s essential to construct a unified, event-centric log that fuses data from GPS trackers, scanner devices, dispatch plans, and maintenance records.

**Steps:**
- **Define Case ID:** Select a suitable granularity. For transportation, “vehicle-day” (e.g., V12-20241205) is appropriate, capturing the full delivery round as a case.
- **Harmonize Timestamps:** Standardize formats (ISO 8601), resolve time zone issues, and ensure chronological integrity across sources.
- **Event Mapping:** Identify key event types from all sources (e.g., Depart Depot, Arrive Customer, Delivery Success, Unscheduled Stop, Maintenance Start/End).
- **Attribute Enrichment:** Add relevant context, such as driver ID, stop number, package ID, location, speed, planned vs. actual route, route start/finish times.
- **Data Fusion:** Merge records based on timestamps and identifiers (vehicle ID, package ID). For events like “Arrive Customer,” synchronize GPS, scanner, and dispatch plan data.
- **Noise/Outlier Filtering:** Remove duplicate or corrupt entries, map anomalies (e.g., GPS drift), and reconcile missing data (e.g., interpolation where sensors signal dropout).

**Challenges:**
- Data synchronization (clock drift, missing/ambiguous events).
- Linking loosely coupled events (e.g., matching maintenance logs to operational round).
- Handling complex, multi-level processes (e.g., events at both round and package levels).
- Volume and event granularity management (filtering excessive GPS pings).

### **b. Process Discovery**
Apply process mining discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner):
- **Visualize End-to-End Process:** From depot departure  sequential customer stops (with deliveries, failed attempts, unscheduled events, traffic delays)  depot return.
- **Trace Variants:** Display frequent and exceptional process paths, including loops (e.g., re-attempted deliveries), unplanned interrupts (maintenance, traffic stops), and idle periods.
- **Perspective Shifts:** View process flows by driver, vehicle, geography, and time slices.

### **c. Conformance Checking**
- **Compare Actual vs. Planned:** Use alignments between event logs and the dispatch’s planned route model.
- **Detect Deviations:**
    - **Sequence Deviations:** Out-of-order deliveries, skipped stops, unexpected intermediate activities.
    - **Unplanned Events:** Unscheduled stops (breakdowns, extended idling), route detours.
    - **Timing Deviations:** Late or early arrivals/departures at customer locations (vs. planned time windows), excessive dwell times.
    - **Resource Deviations:** Vehicle or driver substitutions, capacity overloads.

Conformance checking will result in an inventory of mismatches, quantifying their frequency and impact.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### **a. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
Relevant KPIs for last-mile logistics, calculated using event log data:

| **KPI**                                   | **How to Calculate from Event Log**                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate**                  | % of packages delivered within customer time window (planned vs. actual timestamps) |
| **Avg. Time per Delivery Stop**            | Mean/median of (Depart Previous Customer  Arrive Current Customer  Delivery Complete) |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio**     | Travel Time: sum of driving segments; Service Time: sum of at-customer/stopped intervals |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package**        | Merge telematics data (distance, fuel usage) with delivery counts              |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate**               | Operational hours per day divided by max available hours/vehicle               |
| **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays**   | # and duration of ‘Low Speed’ or ‘Idle’ events not linked to planned stops     |
| **Rate of Failed Deliveries**              | % of ‘Delivery Failed’ vs. total attempts                                     |

### **b. Bottleneck Identification Techniques**
- **Process Flow Animation:** Replay actual traces to visualize where cases accumulate (backlogs, waiting).
- **Heatmaps:** Identify spatial or temporal concentrations of delays (e.g., certain neighborhoods, rush hours).
- **Resource Analysis:** Cross-analyze vehicle, driver, and time-of-day with process performance.
- **Activity Duration/Waiting Time Analysis:** Identify activities consistently exceeding planned durations (e.g., customer interaction, parking).
- **Path Analysis:** Compare fast vs. slow route variants, highlighting congestion or deviation points.

**Examples of Quantifying Impact:**
- Calculate average delay minutes at each activity/location/route.
- Rank drivers by mean delivery or idle times.
- Attribute excess fuel usage to stops with high waiting or reattempt rates.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

After mapping "where" delays and costs occur, the next step is explaining "why"—targeting root causes.

### **Potential Root Causes & Mining Approaches:**

- **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
    - *Static routes ignore real-time traffic and customer changes.*  
    - **Mining Support:** Compare planned vs. actual paths; overlay traffic/incident data on log to identify route detours and sequence re-ordering.

- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimation:**
    - *Planned schedules underestimate (or overestimate) time between stops.*  
    - **Mining Support:** Compute per-leg planned vs. actual time; show which routes or times of day have systematic delays.

- **Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
    - *Urban routes may be chronically slow during rush hours.*  
    - **Mining Support:** Heatmap GPS “Low Speed” events against time/geography; correlate with municipal traffic feeds where possible.

- **High Variability in Service Time:**
    - *Some stops take much longer, perhaps due to parking, customer absence, large deliveries.*  
    - **Mining Support:** Statistical analysis and clustering of service times; link excessive durations to stop type, address, or customer characteristics.

- **Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance:**
    - *Fleet reliability issues trigger unscheduled stops split across multiple process instances (cascading delays).*  
    - **Mining Support:** Overlay maintenance events onto delivery traces to correlate unexpected vehicle downtime with late deliveries/cost spikes.

- **Driver Skill/Behavior Differences:**
    - *Novice or inefficient drivers have higher dwell/idle/fuel times.*  
    - **Mining Support:** Benchmark drivers via process variants and KPIs; flag outliers.

- **Failed Delivery Attempts:**
    - *Causes additional journeys, customer dissatisfaction, re-routing needs.*  
    - **Mining Support:** Analyze sequence variants with 'Failed Delivery' events; quantify additional time/distance, relate to customer communication effectiveness or neighborhood patterns.

**Specific Analyses:**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare fastest vs slowest traces—what process steps or conditions differ?
- **Correlation/Regression:** Link KPIs (e.g., delay minutes, fuel usage) to root causes (e.g., traffic, driver, route structure, time windows).
- **Cluster Analysis:** Group routes by performance to identify systemic versus isolated issues.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic, Real-Time Route Optimization**

- **Target:** Delays due to static, suboptimal routing and traffic unpredictability.
- **Root Cause:** Static route assignment ignores real-time conditions; traffic jams cause cascading lateness and extra costs.
- **Mining Insight:** Process mining exposes frequent deviations, traffic hotspots, and time-of-day bottlenecks (using sequence and location analysis).
- **Action:** 
    - *Deploy route optimization software with real-time traffic integration and feedback from previous log analyses.*
    - *Update routes dynamically during rounds to avoid developing congestion.*
- **Expected Impact:**
    -  On-Time Delivery Rate
    -  Average Delivery/Travel Time per Stop
    -  Fuel Consumption per km/package
    -  Frequency of traffic-related unscheduled stops

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive, Data-Driven Preventive Maintenance**

- **Target:** Unexpected vehicle breakdowns causing route and shift disruption, affecting punctuality and costs.
- **Root Cause:** Maintenance based on schedule or breakdown, not actual usage, creates risk of in-shift failures.
- **Mining Insight:** Event logs correlate high downtime or breakdown frequencies with certain vehicles/usage patterns (variant and correlation analyses).
- **Action:**
    - *Develop and deploy predictive maintenance schedules using vehicle usage/hours patterns from logs.*
    - *Prioritize vehicles for service proactively before failure patterns emerge.*
- **Expected Impact:**
    -  Rate of Unscheduled Stops due to breakdown
    -  Forced overtime and shift overruns
    -  Vehicle Utilization Rate (less unplanned downtime)
    - Controlled maintenance spend

---

### **Strategy 3: Targeted Time Window and Customer Interaction Optimization**

- **Target:** High rate of failed deliveries and service time variability at stops.
- **Root Cause:** Poor time window planning, inadequate pre-delivery communication, or unrealistic customer time promises.
- **Mining Insight:** Logs reveal frequent failed deliveries, clustering at certain times/neighborhoods, or overlong service durations (variant/cluster analysis).
- **Action:**
    - *Apply process mining to optimize time window assignments (e.g., shorter, more reliable windows where feasible).*
    - *Pilot advanced customer notification tools (SMS, live tracking) based on predicted arrival times from process logs.*
    - *Introduce differentiated time window pricing/availability based on delivery route and historical punctuality.*
- **Expected Impact:**
    -  Rate of Failed Deliveries
    -  On-Time Delivery Rate
    -  Service Time Variance, more predictable rounds
    -  Extra travel and overtime due to re-deliveries

## 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

### **a. Accounting for Constraints**
- **Driver Working Hours/Breaks:** Integrate working time directive logic into all route and optimization models. Use process mining to track actual vs. planned shift adherence and flag overloads.
- **Vehicle Capacity & Load:** Ensure route optimization respects size/weight/package count per vehicle, as logged in dispatch plans and validated in actual load data.
- **Customer Time Windows:** Any dynamic adjustment is checked for feasibility with original promised time windows.

### **b. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**

**Setup Process Mining Dashboards:**
- **Monitor in Real Time and After Action:**
    - On-Time vs. Late Delivery Rate per route, driver, area
    - Average and variance of Delivery/Travel/Idle times
    - Fuel Usage KPIs and maintenance events
    - Number/duration of unplanned stops or route deviations

**Process Views:**
- **Process Maps:** Visualize flows for standard vs. variant cases.
- **Bottleneck/Rework Views:** Highlight repeat problem areas (e.g., failed deliveries, maintenance interruptions, idling hotspots).
- **Resource Utilization Heatmaps:** By driver, vehicle, route.
- **Compliance Charts:** Overtime, capacity breaches, time window violations

**Continuous Improvement Loop:**
- Review dashboards weekly; conduct deep-dive root cause analyses for repeatedly underperforming routes/drivers.
- Use continuous discovery (process model/Dashboard drift analysis) to alert to emerging new bottlenecks or opportunity areas following change implementation.
- Iterate optimization strategies based on tracked impact on KPIs.
