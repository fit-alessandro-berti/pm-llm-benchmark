Certainly! Below is an example Python code to implement a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using the `pm4py` library's `ProcessTree` objects. This example assumes a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process with activities such as "Create Purchase Order", "Approve Purchase Order", "Receive Goods", "Pay Invoice", and "Archive Invoice".

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root node for the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=None)

# Create the first child process tree for creating and approving a purchase order
seq_po = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
po_create = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=seq_po)
po_approve = ProcessTree(label="Approve Purchase Order", parent=seq_po)
seq_po.children.append(po_create)
seq_po.children.append(po_approve)

# Create the second child process tree for receiving goods and paying the invoice
par_receive_pay = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=par_receive_pay)
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay Invoice", parent=par_receive_pay)
par_receive_pay.children.append(receive_goods)
par_receive_pay.children.append(pay_invoice)

# Create the third child process tree for archiving the invoice
archive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Archive Invoice", parent=root)

# Add the child process trees to the root node
root.children.append(seq_po)
root.children.append(par_receive_pay)
root.children.append(archive_invoice)

# Set the parent of each node explicitly
seq_po.parent = root
po_create.parent = seq_po
po_approve.parent = seq_po
par_receive_pay.parent = root
receive_goods.parent = par_receive_pay
pay_invoice.parent = par_receive_pay
archive_invoice.parent = root

# Print the process tree structure (for debugging purposes)
def print_process_tree(node, indent=0):
    print("  " * indent + f"Operator: {node.operator}, Label: {node.label if node.label else ''}")
    for child in node.children:
        print_process_tree(child, indent + 1)

print_process_tree(root)
```

This code constructs a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process with the following structure:

1. Parallel execution of:
   - A sequence of creating and approving a purchase order.
   - Parallel execution of receiving goods and paying the invoice.
   - Archiving the invoice.

The `print_process_tree` function is included to help visualize the process tree structure. You can run this code in an environment where `pm4py` is installed to see the hierarchical structure of the process tree.
