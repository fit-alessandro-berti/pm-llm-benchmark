The figure is a time-line style “lifeline” plot that shows how individual traffic-fine cases move through three successive activities during the period 25 Jan 2000 – 24 Apr 2013.

Horizontal layout  
• The x-axis at the bottom is calendar time; three ticks are shown (2000-01-25, 2006-09-09, and 2013-04-24).  
• Every plotted segment is anchored to the exact time its event happened.

Vertical layout (process stages)  
1. Top horizontal line – “Send Fine”  
   Grey vertical strokes rising to this line mark every moment a fine is issued.  
2. Middle horizontal line – “Insert Fine Notification”  
   This is the reference line (y = 0). No separate bars are drawn here; instead it is the point from which downward “lifelines” start.  
3. Bottom horizontal line – “Send for Credit Collection”  
   When a fine is transferred to debt-collection, its lifeline ends on this line.

Connecting lines  
• Each diagonal line represents one single case.  
• It starts on the middle line (when the fine notification is entered) and ends on the bottom line (when the case is sent to credit collection).  
• The steeper the line, the shorter the elapsed time between those two steps; shallow, long triangles indicate long delays.  
• Lines are shaded light-grey to red; the redder lines highlight comparatively short lead times, whereas paler grey lines indicate longer ones (exact coding is not labelled but the contrast makes the shorter delays stand out).

What the picture tells us  
• A very high volume of fines (dense grey bars) was issued constantly through the entire 13-year span.  
• Only a subset of those fines proceeds to the “Insert Fine Notification” step (the beginnings of the diagonal lines) and an even smaller subset proceeds all the way to credit collection (their end points).  
• The vast majority of escalations concentrate in distinct bursts – groups of mostly parallel, similarly angled triangles – suggesting periodic “waves” in which overdue fines were collectively forwarded to the collection agency.  
• Some batches are processed very quickly (the bright red, steep lines), whereas other batches took months or even years (the pale, shallow triangles).

In short, the visualization juxtaposes event frequency (top panel) with case-by-case throughput times (bottom panel), revealing both the volume of fines issued and the highly variable delays before unpaid fines are turned over to credit collection.
