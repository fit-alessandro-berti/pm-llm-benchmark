The figure is a process-flow map that intertwines several document or item types as they progress through a procurement-and-fulfillment life cycle. Across the top are five object categories—VendorInvoiceItem, ReturnOrderItem, PurchaseRequisitionItem, SalesOrderItem, and PurchaseOrderItem—each feeding its own “Start” node. From there, colored connectors (different colors represent the respective item types) trace the average time it takes to move to the next activity.

Key activities appear as rounded rectangles annotated with throughput totals (e.g., “Create Order – Overall: 8.5M,” “Approve Requisition – 5.7M,” “Create Invoice – 2.0M”). Lines between activities include time labels such as “400 ms,” “600 ms,” showing average waiting/transfer times. The process branches and rejoins, illustrating how different item types either converge (e.g., multiple flows leading to “Approve Requisition” or “Create Invoice”) or split into specialized tasks like “Pack Goods,” “Ship Goods,” or “Process Return.” Each branch ends with an “End” node, indicating completion for that flow. Overall, the visualization highlights both the volume handled at each stage and the typical delays, enabling the viewer to compare paths for requisitions, purchase orders, sales orders, invoices, and returns within a unified process view.
