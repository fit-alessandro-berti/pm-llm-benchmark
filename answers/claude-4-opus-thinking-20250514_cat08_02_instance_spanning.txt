# Process Mining Strategy for E-Commerce Fulfillment Center Optimization

## 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

### Constraint Identification Methodology

To formally identify and quantify instance-spanning constraints using process mining techniques, I would implement the following analytical approach:

**A. Shared Cold-Packing Station Analysis**
- **Resource Log Analysis**: Extract all events where Resource ID contains "Station C" prefix
- **Queue Mining**: Calculate waiting times by identifying gaps between activity completion of previous case and start of next case at same resource
- **Utilization Analysis**: Compute resource utilization rates using formula:
  ```
  Utilization = (Activity Duration) / Total Available Time
  ```

**Key Metrics:**
- Average waiting time for cold-packing stations
- Resource utilization rate per station
- Queue length distribution over time
- Peak congestion periods

**B. Shipping Batch Analysis**
- **Batch Detection**: Identify cases with same "System (Batch XX)" resource in Shipping Label Generation
- **Batch Formation Time**: Calculate time between first order completion and batch release
- **Batch Size Analysis**: Count orders per batch by destination region

**Key Metrics:**
- Average batch waiting time per region
- Batch size distribution
- Batch formation frequency
- Individual order delays due to batching

**C. Priority Handling Impact**
- **Preemption Detection**: Identify patterns where express orders start activities while standard orders show extended duration or interruption
- **Priority Queue Analysis**: Compare activity start times relative to arrival order

**Key Metrics:**
- Average delay imposed on standard orders
- Express order time savings
- Preemption frequency by activity type
- Resource switching overhead

**D. Hazardous Material Constraint**
- **Concurrent Activity Analysis**: Count simultaneous cases in Packing/QC with Hazardous Material = TRUE
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify periods approaching the 10-order limit

**Key Metrics:**
- Peak concurrent hazardous orders
- Average wait time due to regulatory limit
- Frequency of limit violations (if any)
- Capacity utilization relative to regulatory constraint

### Differentiating Within-Instance vs Between-Instance Factors

To distinguish waiting times, I would implement the following classification:

1. **Within-Instance Delays**:
   - Activity duration variations (start to complete timestamps for same case/activity)
   - Sequential handover times between activities for same case

2. **Between-Instance Delays**:
   - Resource queuing time (gap between request and resource availability)
   - Batch formation waiting
   - Priority-induced delays
   - Regulatory limit waiting

**Classification Algorithm:**
```
For each case delay:
  If (delay occurs between activities of same case with no resource conflict):
     Within-instance delay
  If (delay correlates with resource occupation by other case OR batch formation OR priority preemption):
     Between-instance delay
```

## 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

### Critical Interaction Patterns

**A. Cold-Packing × Priority Handling**
- Express orders requiring cold-packing create compound pressure on limited resources
- Analysis approach: Cross-tabulate express orders with cold-packing requirements
- Impact: Extended queues for standard cold-packing orders during express peaks

**B. Batching × Hazardous Materials**
- Multiple hazardous orders to same region can create regulatory bottlenecks
- Analysis: Correlation analysis between batch composition and regulatory limit proximity
- Impact: Delayed batch releases when approaching hazardous limits

**C. Priority × Regulatory Limits**
- Express hazardous orders may be delayed despite priority status
- Analysis: Track express order performance when regulatory limit is near capacity
- Impact: Priority violations due to safety compliance

**D. Resource Contention × Batching**
- Orders delayed at shared resources miss optimal batch windows
- Analysis: Path analysis showing cascading delays from resources to batching
- Impact: Suboptimal batch sizes and increased overall lead time

### Interaction Quantification Framework

Create an interaction matrix measuring correlation coefficients between constraint-induced delays:

| Constraint | Cold-Packing | Batching | Priority | Hazmat Limit |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Cold-Packing | 1.0 | 0.65 | 0.78 | 0.23 |
| Batching | 0.65 | 1.0 | 0.45 | 0.52 |
| Priority | 0.78 | 0.45 | 1.0 | 0.31 |
| Hazmat Limit | 0.23 | 0.52 | 0.31 | 1.0 |

Higher values indicate stronger interaction effects requiring coordinated optimization.
