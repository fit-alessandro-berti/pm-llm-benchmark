## Notes on Estimation:

1. **Supplier-to-Receive Phase**: Estimated at ~7 days due to typical international supply chain lead times.
2. **Quality Inspection Duration**: Relatively short (~2 hours) as it's an automated/semi-automated process.
3. **Assembly Duration**: ~4-8 hours depending on complexity; high variance accounts for complexity variations.
4. **Testing Phase**: ~8 hours with moderate variance; more rigorous testing increases variability.
5. **Packaging & Distribution**: Short local times (~1-3 hours) but distribution can take 1+ days.
6. **After-Sales Support**: Estimated window of ~3 days post-delivery for support activation.
7. **Standard Deviations**: Generally 15-25% of average times, reflecting supply chain variability (delays, expedited processes, quality issues).
