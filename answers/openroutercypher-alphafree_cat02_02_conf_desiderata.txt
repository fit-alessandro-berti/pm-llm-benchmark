### Normative Rule Violations

#### Case ID 2
- **Violation of Credit Check Before Risk Assessment**
  - **Event Log Timestamps:**
    - **2024-01-11 08:20:** Risk Assessment
    - **2024-01-11 09:00:** Credit Check
  - **Reason:** Risk Assessment was conducted before the Credit Check, which directly violates the normative rule that states Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.

- **Unnecessary Finalization of Documentation for Rejected Loan**
  - **Event Log Timestamps:**
    - **2024-01-11 09:30:** Loan Decision (Rejected)
    - **2024-01-11 10:00:** Finalize Documentation 
  - **Reason:** Finalize Documentation was executed even though the loan decision was rejected. According to the normative rules, documentation should not be finalized if the loan is rejected, and the case should be closed directly.

### Desiderata Violations

#### Case ID 3
- **Late Credit Check**
  - **Event Log Timestamps:**
    - **2024-01-12 09:00:** Application Received
    - **2024-01-14 10:00:** Credit Check
  - **Reason:** The Credit Check was performed more than 24 hours after the application was received, contrary to the best practice guideline.

- **Delayed Inform Applicant (Beyond 48-Hour Mark)**
  - **Event Log Timestamps:**
    - **2024-01-14 12:00:** Loan Decision (Approved)
    - **2024-01-16 15:00:** Inform Applicant
  - **Reason:** There was a delay in informing the applicant of the loan decision. The recommended practice is to inform within 48 hours of the decision, but in this case, the delay stretched over this suggested timeline.

### Interpretations and Justifications:

#### Case ID 2:
1. **Interpretation:** 
    - It's possible technical or human error led to prematurely performing the Risk Assessment without first completing the Credit Check.
    - Similarly, the subsequent documenting finalization for rejection indicates a potential misinterpretation of the protocol or procedural miscommunication. 

#### Case ID 3:
1. **Interpretation:** 
   - The delayed performance of the Credit Check could have resulted from system lag, staffing shortages, or prioritization errors.
   - The delay in informing the applicant might be due to administrative backlogs or waiting for additional verification or approvals.

2. **Justifications for Delays:**
   - High workload or staffing issues could lead to processing delays.
   - Overemphasis on thoroughness at each step may have indirectly impacted adhering to soft timing recommendations.

#### General Justifications:
- It is often beneficial to focus both on adhering to strict operational rules and optimizing soft guideline times. Consistent deviations from these recommended timings indicate a need for efficiency improvement or process adjustment review. 

**Note:** Addressing and resolving these observed deviations promptly might improve the process and minimize future occurrences.
