Certainly! Below is the Python code that uses **pm4py** to implement a process tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. This process tree models the typical steps involved in a Purchase-to-Pay process, including choices and parallel activities.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root of the process tree with a SEQUENCE operator
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Step 1: 'Create Purchase Requisition'
create_pr = ProcessTree(label='Create Purchase Requisition', parent=root)
root.children.append(create_pr)

# Step 2: Approval step (XOR between 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and 'Expedite Approval')
approval_step = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)

# Options for the approval step
approve_pr = ProcessTree(label='Approve Purchase Requisition', parent=approval_step)
expedite_approval = ProcessTree(label='Expedite Approval', parent=approval_step)

# Add the approval options to the XOR node
approval_step.children.append(approve_pr)
approval_step.children.append(expedite_approval)

# Add the approval step to the root sequence
root.children.append(approval_step)

# Step 3: 'Create Purchase Order'
create_po = ProcessTree(label='Create Purchase Order', parent=root)
root.children.append(create_po)

# Step 4: 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier'
send_po = ProcessTree(label='Send Purchase Order to Supplier', parent=root)
root.children.append(send_po)

# Step 5: Parallel execution of receiving goods and receiving invoice
parallel_node = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)

# First branch of the parallel node: Receive and record goods
goods_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=parallel_node)
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label='Receive Goods', parent=goods_sequence)
record_goods_receipt = ProcessTree(label='Record Goods Receipt', parent=goods_sequence)
goods_sequence.children.append(receive_goods)
goods_sequence.children.append(record_goods_receipt)

# Second branch of the parallel node: Receive and record invoice
invoice_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=parallel_node)
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label='Receive Invoice', parent=invoice_sequence)
record_invoice_receipt = ProcessTree(label='Record Invoice Receipt', parent=invoice_sequence)
invoice_sequence.children.append(receive_invoice)
invoice_sequence.children.append(record_invoice_receipt)

# Add both sequences to the parallel node
parallel_node.children.append(goods_sequence)
parallel_node.children.append(invoice_sequence)

# Add the parallel node to the root sequence
root.children.append(parallel_node)

# Step 6: 'Match Invoice to Goods Receipt'
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label='Match Invoice to Goods Receipt', parent=root)
root.children.append(match_invoice)

# Step 7: 'Process Payment'
process_payment = ProcessTree(label='Process Payment', parent=root)
root.children.append(process_payment)

# Now, root represents the process tree for the Purchase-to-Pay process
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Root Node**: We start by creating the root of the process tree with a `SEQUENCE` operator, indicating that the steps will generally occur in sequence.

2. **Create Purchase Requisition**: We add this as the first child of the root node.

3. **Approval Step**: We introduce an `XOR` operator to model the exclusive choice between 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and 'Expedite Approval'.

4. **Create Purchase Order and Send to Supplier**: These steps are added sequentially after the approval step.

5. **Parallel Activities**: We use a `PARALLEL` operator to model that 'Receive Goods' and 'Receive Invoice' (along with their recording steps) can happen concurrently.

6. **Matching and Payment**: After the parallel activities, the process continues with matching the invoice to the goods receipt and finally processing the payment.

**Visualization:**

You can visualize this process tree using `pm4py`'s visualization capabilities as follows:

```python
from pm4py.visualization.process_tree import factory as pt_vis_factory

gviz = pt_vis_factory.apply(root)
pt_vis_factory.view(gviz)
```

This will render a graphical representation of the process tree, showing the sequence, choice, and parallel constructs.

**Notes:**

- **Parent References**: It's crucial to set the `parent` attribute for each child node to ensure that the tree structure is correctly maintained.
- **Appending Children**: We append child nodes to their respective parents' `children` lists to build the tree.
- **Operators**: We use `Operator.SEQUENCE`, `Operator.XOR`, and `Operator.PARALLEL` to represent the sequence, exclusive choice, and parallel execution in the process.
