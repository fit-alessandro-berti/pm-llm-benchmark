Here is a single process tree (using the given operators and tau) that models the entire scenario. The re-diagnostic “RDT” step is realized as an exclusive choice between the concrete follow-up tests FCE and FBA; the abnormal-results loop is optional via X(tau, …) so that if the initial diagnostic is normal, the loop is skipped.
