Based on the provided process variants and the frequency of events, I will generate a basic DECLARE model using the constraints you provided. The frequency and performance data will not directly affect the generation of the DECLARE model itself because the DECLARE model focuses on the behavioral patterns between activities based on constraints. However, the number of times an activity occurs and the relationships between activities will inspire which constraints to apply.

### Key Assumptions
- **Create Fine** is an initialization activity and everything else follows.
- **Payment** and **Send for Credit Collection** seem to be an alternate ending point.
- **Send Fine** seems often followed by other activities like **Insert Fine Notification**.
- Based on the data, no activity seems to be restricted from happening (e.g. no absence constraints).
- Activities such as **Notify Result Appeal to Offender** and **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture** might indicate that their predecessors (like **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture**) act as precedents.

### Steps to Generate:
1. **Initialization**: The model starts with **Create Fine**.
2. **Existence**: Some events should appear at least once (e.g., **Create Fine**).
3. **Response/Succession**: Based on observed sequences across process variants.
4. **Precedence**: Some activities must happen before others.
5. **Co-Existence**: If one event occurs, another corresponding event must also occur in the trace (for example, response appeal steps).

### Breakdown:
1. **`existence`**:
   - **Create Fine**, **Send Fine**, and other high-frequency activities are declared to happen at least once in the trace with full support and confidence (since they appear across variants).
   
2. **`init`**:
   - The process always starts by **Create Fine**.

3. **`responded_existence`**:
   - Several activities, such as **Add penalty** and **Insert Fine Notification**, or **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture** and its antecedents, must co-exist in some traces.

4. **`response` and `precedence`** focus on behaviors where activities must happen either as a future or past consequence of each other.

5. **`succession`, `chainresponse`, `chainprecedence`, `chainsuccession`** express direct implications between activities either immediately after each other or generally.

6. **`noncoexistence`**, `nonsuccession`, `nonchainsuccession` are essential to prevent certain behaviors such as **Payment** not immediately followed by **Send for Credit Collection**.

### Conclusion:
This is a basic DECLARE model based on the observations from the variants. Additional refinements could be made as more specific constraints become apparent in analyzing the process in context. The DECLARE constraints can be visualized using pm4py tools for further analysis and enhancements.
