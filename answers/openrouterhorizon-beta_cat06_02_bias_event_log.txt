Here’s where bias is showing up and how it affects outcomes:

Where bias manifests
1) ScoreAdjustment based on CommunityGroup
- Applicants affiliated with “Highland Civic Darts Club” receive a +10 adjustment during PreliminaryScoring, which persists through ManualReview and FinalDecision (e.g., C001 and C004).
- Applicants without a listed community group receive 0 adjustment (C002, C003, C005).
- This is a systematic, non-risk-based uplift tied to affiliation, not to underlying creditworthiness.

2) Potential proxy bias via LocalResident
- All cases with the community uplift are also LocalResident = TRUE (C001, C004). While LocalResident alone doesn’t show an explicit adjustment, the uplift is effectively available only to a subgroup that appears correlated with locality and a specific community organization. This could act as a proxy for geography, social network, or demographic traits.

3) Outcome disparities unexplained by risk signals
- C003 (Score 715, LocalResident = FALSE, no community group) was rejected, despite having a higher or comparable score to some approved cases:
  • Approved: C004 had 690 base, became 700 due to +10 community uplift.
  • Approved: C001 had 710 base, became 720 with uplift.
  • Approved: C002 had 720 base, no uplift.
  • Approved: C005 had 740 base, no uplift.
- The only rejected case (C003) lacks both local residency and community affiliation and received no uplift, despite a score (715) that is within the range of other approvals. This is a red flag for disparate impact.

How this favors certain groups
- CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club”: Confers a guaranteed +10 advantage, enough to move borderline cases across an approval threshold (e.g., from 690 to 700).
- Correlated with LocalResident: If membership is largely local, locals have more access to uplift than non-locals. This creates an unequal playing field for otherwise similar applicants.

Implications for fairness and equity
- Applicants without community ties (newcomers, migrants, lower social capital, or simply those not in favored organizations) are disadvantaged relative to similarly creditworthy peers.
- Geographic or social network proxies can introduce indirect discrimination, even if protected attributes are not explicitly used.
- The uplift can distort risk-based decisions by admitting lower-scoring, affiliated applicants while excluding higher-scoring, unaffiliated ones (as seen with C003 vs. C004), undermining consistency and explainability.

Recommendations to mitigate bias
- Remove or justify community-based adjustments: If retained, demonstrate a clear, data-driven risk relationship (e.g., empirically lower default rates for verified groups). Otherwise, eliminate the uplift.
- Replace affiliation proxies with objective, individual-level risk features only.
- Conduct outcome monitoring: Track approval rates and thresholds by LocalResident and CommunityGroup; run disparate impact and odds ratio analyses.
- Threshold transparency: Define and publish consistent approval thresholds. If 700 is the operational threshold, ensure adjustments are tied to risk evidence and applied uniformly.
- Governance: Require fairness reviews for any non-risk-based adjustments; document rationale and periodic revalidation.
