This visualization shows a healthcare system workflow diagram with three main components:

## (a) Two prodel classes connected through two channels
This is a process flow diagram showing the interaction between an Order system and a HIS (Hospital Information System). The workflow includes:

- **Lab visit process**: Starting with a doctor ordering lab tests, including steps for order entry and taking blood samples
- **Lab test process**: Including receiving results, judging results, performing tests, and finishing lab tests
- **Multiple actors**: doctor, lab assistant, lab analyst, and chemical analyst (shown as stick figures)
- **Connection points**: Numbered nodes (T1-T4) showing communication channels between the two systems
- **Actions**: Such as "Make report," "Perform test," "Send report," and "Provide updated report"

## (b) Class diagram containing the two prodel classes
A simple UML-style diagram showing:
- Two classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test"
- A relationship labeled "requires" connecting them
- Cardinality notation (1..1 and 1..*)

## (c) Example of a performative
A table showing a specific message exchange with columns for:
- Time: 11:00
- Channel: Order system
- Sender: Lab visit - John
- Receivers: Lab test - John
- Action: Create
- Content: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
- Scope: Private
- Direction: OUT

This appears to be documenting a healthcare laboratory information system architecture and its communication protocols.
