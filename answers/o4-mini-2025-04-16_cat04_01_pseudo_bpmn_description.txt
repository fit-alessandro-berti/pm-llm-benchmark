Below is a stepbystep walkthrough of the process, explaining the purpose of each task, the logic of the gateways, how the parallel and exclusive branches work, where they converge, and under what conditions loops or rework occur.

1. Start Event  
   • The process is triggered when a new customer request arrives.

2. Task A – “Receive Customer Request”  
   • Intake and record all relevant details of the request (customer info, products, quantities, dates, custom requirements, etc.).

3. Gateway (XOR) – “Check Request Type”  
   • An exclusive decision: Is this a Standard request or a Custom request?  
   • Only one path is taken.

4. Standard Path (if Type = Standard)  
   4.1 Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
       • Verify that the request meets predefined business rules (pricing, product configuration, basic terms).  
   4.2 Gateway (AND) – “Run Parallel Checks”  
       • Fork into two parallel activities that can occur simultaneously:  
         – Task C1 – “Credit Check” (confirm customer creditworthiness)  
         – Task C2 – “Inventory Check” (confirm stock availability)  
   4.3 Join (AND) – “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
       • Waits until both credit and inventory checks finish.  
   4.4 Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
       • Based on stock lead times, shipping options and customer location, compute the promised delivery date.

5. Custom Path (if Type = Custom)  
   5.1 Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
       • Assess whether the requested custom features/configurations are technically and commercially feasible.  
   5.2 Gateway (XOR) – “Is Customization Feasible?”  
       • If No  Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice”  End Event (process terminates)  
       • If Yes  Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation” (build tailored cost estimate, specs, terms)

6. Convergence of Standard and Custom Paths  
   • After Task D (standard) or Task E1 (custom quotation), both branches feed into the same next decision.

7. Gateway (XOR) – “Is Approval Needed?”  
   • Based on order value, risk profile or internal policy, determine if manager approval is required.  
   • If No  skip approval and go straight to Task G.  
   • If Yes  proceed to Task F.

8. Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”  
   • Submit the calculated delivery/date quote or custom quotation to a manager.

9. Gateway (XOR) – “Is Approval Granted?”  
   • If Yes  Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
   • If No  Task H – “Re-evaluate Conditions” (trigger rework)

10. Task H – “Reevaluate Conditions”  
   • Analyze why approval was denied (price too low/high, delivery unrealistic, scope unclear).  
   • Adjust either the standard delivery date (go back to Task D) or the custom quotation (go back to Task E1).  
   • This creates a loop: after adjustments, the flow returns to “Is Approval Needed?” and repeats approval if still required.

11. Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
   • Produce the official invoice or order confirmation document, including price, delivery terms, payment terms.

12. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
   • Email or otherwise deliver the invoice/confirmation and delivery schedule to the customer.

13. End Event  
   • The process completes when the customer has been sent confirmation (or earlier if a custom request was rejected).

Key points on gateways and loops:

- XOR (exclusive) gateways choose exactly one outgoing path based on a condition.  
- AND (parallel) gateways split work into parallel streams (C1 & C2) and the corresponding join waits for all to finish.  
- After a failed approval (Task H), the flow loops back to either the quotation step (custom) or delivery calculation (standard) so that you can revise and resubmit for approval.  
- The standard and custom branches only split at the start and only truly terminate separately if a custom request is rejected; otherwise they reconverge at the “Is Approval Needed?” decision.
