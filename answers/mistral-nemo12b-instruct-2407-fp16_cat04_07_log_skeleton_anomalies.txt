Based on the provided information, here are several anomalies and inconsistencies in the proposed process model:

1. **Missing Transitions:**
   - There are no directly-follows constraints from 'Request Payment' to any other activity. It seems that once a declaration is approved by the budget owner or supervisor, there should be a request for payment, but this transition is missing.
   - Similarly, there's no clear transition from 'Payment Handled' to any final state, like 'Declaration Completed' or 'Invoice Sent'.

2. **Inconsistent Roles:**
   - In some transitions, 'MISSING' is used as a role (e.g., 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'), but it's unclear who this role represents or how they fit into the approval process.
   - In other transitions, roles like 'EMPLOYEE', 'ADMINISTRATION', 'SUPERVISOR', 'PRE_APPROVER', and 'BUDGET OWNER' are used consistently. It would be better to maintain this consistency.

3. **Unclear Role Hierarchy:**
   - The role hierarchy is not clear from the given information. For example, it's not specified if 'ADMINISTRATION', 'SUPERVISOR', and 'BUDGET OWNER' are different roles or if they have a hierarchical relationship.
   - In some transitions, 'PRE_APPROVER' seems to be involved in the approval process before 'ADMINISTRATION', 'SUPERVISOR', and 'BUDGET OWNER'. It would help to clarify this role's position in the hierarchy.

4. **Inconsistent Approval Paths:**
   - A declaration can be approved by either 'ADMINISTRATION' or 'BUDGET OWNER', but it's not clear when one should approve over the other.
   - Similarly, a declaration can be rejected by multiple roles ('EMPLOYEE', 'ADMINISTRATION', 'SUPERVISOR', 'PRE_APPROVER', 'MISSING'), and there are no clear rules on who should reject it at each stage.

5. **Lack of Final State:**
   - There is no final state or activity to indicate that a declaration has been completely processed (e.g., 'Declaration Completed' or 'Invoice Sent'). This makes the process model seem incomplete.

6. **Unused Activities:**
   - Some activities, like 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE', have no directly-follows constraints leading from them. This could indicate that these activities are not necessary or might be remnants of previous versions of the process model.

7. **Inconsistent Activity Names:**
   - Some activities use different terminology for similar states (e.g., 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' and 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'). It would help to maintain consistency in naming conventions.

To improve the process model, it's crucial to clarify these points and establish a clear, consistent, and well-defined workflow.
