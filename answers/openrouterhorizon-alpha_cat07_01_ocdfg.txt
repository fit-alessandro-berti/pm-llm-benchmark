This is a process-flow visualization that combines multiple event streams into one end-to-end view. It shows how items from different sources move through a business workflow, with volumes and average durations between steps.

Key elements:
- Four sources at the top: VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M), ReturnOrderItem (0.8M), PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M), SalesOrderItem (3.5M), and PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M). Each has a “Start.”
- Central early steps:
  - Create Requisition  Approve Requisition (overall 5.7M).
- Left/middle operational steps:
  - Send Order (overall 5.2M).
  - Check Stock (1.0M).
  - Approve Payment (1.5M).
  - Create Invoice (2.0M).
- Right fulfillment branch (from Sales/Purchase order):
  - Create Order (8.5M)  Pack Goods (2.0M)  Ship Goods (1.8M)  Confirm Delivery (1.7M)  Close Order (1.7M).
- Returns branch:
  - Process Return (0.8M), feeding back toward Create Invoice and Close Order.
- Multiple “End” nodes at the bottom for each branch.

Edges show average transition times (e.g., 300–650 ms) and colored paths indicate different source streams converging/diverging. Overall, the diagram maps procurement-to-fulfillment-to-billing, including returns, with throughput counts and timing between activities.
