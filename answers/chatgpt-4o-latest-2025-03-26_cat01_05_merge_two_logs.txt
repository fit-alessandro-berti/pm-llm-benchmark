###  **Merged Event Log for Order#1234**

The following is a unified and enriched event log resulting from the integration of **Log A** (System A) and **Log B** (System B). Events are ordered chronologically using the **earlier** of the two timestamps when available. Matching events were merged based on intent (event name similarity), **order_id**, and **timestamp proximity** (within 2 seconds). Where no suitable match was identified, the event is included with its origin explicitly noted.

---

####  **Event 1: Order Received / OrderReceived**

**Merged Event**  
- **Primary Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z` (from System B - slightly earlier)  
- `event_type`: Order Received  
- `event_name`: OrderReceived  
- `order_id`: Order#1234  
- `user_id`: u45  
- `resource_id`: r10  
- `notes`: "Event captured at warehouse system"  
- `source_logs`: A, B  

**Reasoning:**  
- Timestamps: `2023-10-10T10:00:00Z` (Log A) vs `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z` (Log B): 2-second difference —  within matching threshold.  
- Event type vs name: “Order Received” vs “OrderReceived” — strong semantic match.  
 Merged successfully.

####  **Event 2: Order Validated / OrderValidation**

**Merged Event**  
- **Primary Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z` (from System B - slightly earlier)  
- `event_type`: Order Validated  
- `event_name`: OrderValidation  
- `order_id`: Order#1234  
- `user_id`: u12  
- `resource_id`: r10  
- `notes`: "Cross-check inventory"  
- `source_logs`: A, B  

**Reasoning:**  
- Timestamps: `2023-10-10T10:01:30Z` (Log A) vs `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z` (Log B): 1-second difference —  within matching threshold.  
- Event type vs name: “Order Validated” vs “OrderValidation” — clear conceptual match.  
 Merged successfully.

####  **Event 3: Payment Processed / PaymentCheck**

**Merged Event**  
- **Primary Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z` (System A)  
- `event_type`: Payment Processed  
- `event_name`: PaymentCheck  
- `order_id`: Order#1234  
- `user_id`: u12  
- `resource_id`: r99  
- `notes`: "Payment gateway delay"  
- `source_logs`: A, B  

**Reasoning:**  
- Timestamps: `2023-10-10T10:02:00Z` (A) vs `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z` (B): 5-second difference.  **Exceeds threshold**, but still reasonable alignment given semantic similarity.  
- Event type vs name: “Payment Processed” vs “PaymentCheck” — strong contextual correlation.  
 Merged cautiously with note of timestamp difference.

####  **Event 4: Quality Check**

**Unmatched Event from Log B**  
- **Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z`  
- `event_type`: *Unmatched*  
- `event_name`: Quality Check  
- `order_id`: Order#1234  
- `user_id`: u45  
- `resource_id`: r11  
- `notes`: "Random inspection"  
- `source_logs`: B  

**Reasoning:**  
- No equivalent or corresponding event in Log A. This appears to be a system-B-specific activity.  
 Included as-is with origin noted.

---

####  **Event 5: Item Shipped / Shipping**

**Merged Event**  
- **Primary Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z` (System A)  
- `event_type`: Item Shipped  
- `event_name`: Shipping  
- `order_id`: Order#1234  
- `user_id`: u45  
- `resource_id`: r10  
- `notes`: "Package handed to courier"  
- `source_logs`: A, B  

**Reasoning:**  
- Timestamps: `2023-10-10T10:05:00Z` (A) vs `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z` (B): 2-second difference —  within tolerance.  
- Event type vs name: “Item Shipped” vs “Shipping” — clear alignment.  
 Merged successfully.

---

####  **Event 6: Item Delivered**

**Unmatched Event from Log A**  
- **Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z`  
- `event_type`: Item Delivered  
- `order_id`: Order#1234  
- `source_logs`: A  

**Reasoning:**  
- No corresponding event in Log B. Likely that the delivery confirmation was only tracked in System A.  
 Included as-is with origin noted.

###  Summary of Matching Methodology & Conflict Resolution

- **Matching Criteria**:  
  - Event pairing was primarily based on:
    - Matching `order_id`
    - Timestamp difference  2 sec (with leniency up to 5 sec where the match was semantically clear)
    - Semantically similar event names

- **Event Name Resolution**:
  - Used normalized naming (e.g., "OrderReceived" == "Order Received")
  - A mapping table could be developed for automated processing in future iterations.

- **Timestamps**:
  - When both sources were available, earliest timestamp was treated as “primary”, with the assumption Log A may reflect processed times, and Log B may be closer to “actual” timestamps.

- **Unmatched Events**:
  - Included transparently with `source_logs` metadata and appropriate handling to preserve traceability.

 **Result:** A unified, chronologically ordered, and attribute-rich log that provides a complete view of the order's lifecycle across both systems.
