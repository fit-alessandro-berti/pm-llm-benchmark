This is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram showing an endtoend orderfulfilment process across several departments (lanes): Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

**1. Sales lane**
- Starts on *Monday morning*.
- “Check order for completeness.”
- “Check if customer is already in the database.”
  - If not, “Add customer to the database,” updating a database object.
- Once the customer is registered, the subprocess “Check customer’s order” ends.
- Sales then “Send order details” to downstream lanes.
- After the product is sent (information coming back from Warehouse), Sales prepares a “Draft invoice,” which ends the Sales process.

**2. Production lane**
- Triggered when “Order details arrive.”
- “Plan production,” then a gateway:
  - If material is not faulty, proceed to “Manufacture product.”
- On completion, the event “Product complete” is thrown, sending a message to the Warehouse lane (to ship the product).

**3. Procurement lane**
- Also triggered by “Order details arrive.”
- Contains a subprocess “Material Compensation Subprocess”:
  - “Order materials.”
  - If needed, “Return material” (loop or compensation action).
- After materials are procured, “Check materials.”
  - If materials fail the check, the process can lead to “Order cancellation.”
- Events and dashed lines show interaction with Production (e.g., providing good materials).

**4. Warehouse lane**
- Waits for the “Product complete” message from Production.
- Executes “Send product.”
- When the product is sent, an event notifies Sales (dashed line) so invoicing can start.
- The Warehouse process ends after “Product sent.”

Overall, the diagram visualizes how a customer order is received, validated, produced, supplied with materials, shipped, and finally invoiced, with message flows linking the four functional areas.
