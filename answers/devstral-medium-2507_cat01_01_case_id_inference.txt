To infer the case groupings from the given sequence of hospital process events, we need to analyze the attributes such as `timestamp`, `activity`, `department`, `patient_age`, and `patient_gender`. By following the logical order and continuity of activities for each patient, we can deduce the distinct patient journeys (cases).

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify Initial Registration Events:**
   - Event 1: `Register patient` for a 45-year-old male in the ER.
   - Event 2: `Register patient` for a 62-year-old female in the ER.
   - Event 3: `Register patient` for a 28-year-old male in Surgery.

2. **Track Subsequent Activities for Each Patient:**
   - **Case 1 (45-year-old male in ER):**
     - Event 1: `Register patient`
     - Event 4: `Initial triage`
     - Event 7: `X-ray imaging`
     - Event 12: `Doctor consultation`
     - Event 15: `Patient discharged`

   - **Case 2 (62-year-old female in ER):**
     - Event 2: `Register patient`
     - Event 5: `Initial triage`
     - Event 8: `Lab test requested`
     - Event 10: `Lab test completed`
     - Event 11: `Doctor consultation`
     - Event 14: `Prescription created`
     - Event 17: `Patient discharged`

   - **Case 3 (28-year-old male in Surgery):**
     - Event 3: `Register patient`
     - Event 6: `Doctor consultation`
     - Event 9: `Surgery preparation`
     - Event 13: `Surgery performed`
     - Event 16: `Recovery room`
     - Event 18: `Patient discharged`

By following the sequence of activities and ensuring continuity based on the patient's age, gender, and department, we can group the events into three distinct cases:

- **Case 1 (45-year-old male in ER):**
  - Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15

- **Case 2 (62-year-old female in ER):**
  - Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17

- **Case 3 (28-year-old male in Surgery):**
  - Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

These groupings represent the distinct patient journeys through the hospital process.
