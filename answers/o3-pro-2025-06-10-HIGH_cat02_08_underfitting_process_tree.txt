1. A concrete “wrong-but-allowed” trace  
   Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Ship_Order, Package_Items, Authorize_Payment, Close_Order

2. Why this trace is unacceptable from a business point of view  

• The trace respects the process tree:  
  – “Receive_Order” and “Check_Inventory” occur first (root SEQUENCE).  
  – The XOR branch “successful_subtree” is taken.  
  – Inside that branch the three activities Authorize_Payment, Package_Items and Ship_Order belong to a PARALLEL node, so the tree allows them in any order.  
  – After the branch finishes, the final “Close_Order” required by the root SEQUENCE is executed.  
  Hence the tree considers the trace fitting.

• Domain violation:  
  – Goods are shipped (Ship_Order) before they have even been packed (Package_Items) and before the customer’s payment has been authorised (Authorize_Payment).  
  – In an Order-to-Cash process the usual, mandatory order is  
       1. Authorize Payment  
       2. Package Items  
       3. Ship Order  
  – Shipping something that is neither paid for nor packed is impossible in reality, so the trace is clearly invalid from a business perspective.

The fact that the model’s PARALLEL operator imposes no ordering constraint among these three activities illustrates its underfitting nature: it accepts behaviour that the real process would never allow.
