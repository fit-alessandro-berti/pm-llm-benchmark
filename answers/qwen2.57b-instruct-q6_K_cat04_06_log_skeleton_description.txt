The provided Log Skeleton process model describes a business process for managing declarations and payments. The declarative constraints define various relationships between activities, ensuring that certain sequences of events occur in specific ways. Let's break down the key aspects:

### Equivalence Constraints

Equivalence constraints specify that if one activity occurs, it has the same occurrences as another activity. Here are some examples from your model:

- `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')`: If a declaration is approved by the administration, then a final approval by the supervisor must occur with the same frequency.
- `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')`: Similarly, if a pre-approver approves a declaration, it should also be submitted by an employee.

### Always Before Constraints

Always before constraints ensure that one activity occurs before another in any case. For instance:

- `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')`: The supervisorâ€™s approval of the declaration must occur before the declaration is submitted by an employee.
- `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')`: The pre-approvers' approval must also come before submission.

### Always After Constraints

Always after constraints ensure that if one activity occurs, another follows within the same case. Examples include:

- `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')`: If a pre-approvers approves a declaration, it should be followed by a rejection due to missing information.
- `('Payment Handled', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE')`: Handling the payment occurs after the employee rejects the declaration.

### Never Together Constraints

Never together constraints specify that two activities cannot occur in the same case. Examples are:

- `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION')`: The supervisor's approval and rejection by administration cannot coexist.
- `('Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')`: Saving a declaration and submitting it simultaneously is not allowed.

### Activity Occurrences

Activity occurrences constraints define the minimum and maximum number of times an activity can occur in any case. For example:

- `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`: The declaration submission by an employee can happen between 0 to 7 times.
- `Request Payment: 0, 1`: A payment request can occur either not at all or once.

### Directly-Follows Constraints

Directly follows constraints ensure that if one activity occurs, another directly follows it. Examples include:

- `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')`: If a supervisor approves the declaration, it must be rejected due to missing information next.
- `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')`: A pre-approvers' approval directly leads to submission.

### Overall Process Description

The overall process can be described as follows:

1. **Declaration Initialization**: Declarations are initiated and may go through multiple stages of approval before being finalized.
2. **Approval Flow**:
   - The declaration is first submitted by an employee, which triggers the initial round of approvals (admin, supervisor, pre-approvers).
   - If approved at each level, it moves forward; if not, it can be rejected based on specific criteria like missing information or administrative issues.
3. **Payment Handling**: Once a declaration is fully approved (by all necessary parties), payment handling occurs.
4. **Error Handling and Rejection**:
   - Various stages allow for rejection due to different reasons such as missing data, administrative actions, budget owner rejections, etc.
5. **Final Approval**:
   - After all approvals are complete, the declaration is finalized by the supervisor.

This process ensures that each step is properly validated and that certain sequences of events are mandatory, preventing any invalid or incomplete states from occurring in the workflow.
